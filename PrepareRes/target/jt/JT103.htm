		Beloved Brother -- We appreciated your telegram at Queenstown.<a name=1:8></a> I mailed you from there the two sets of French notes.<a name=1:9></a> I assumed there are no more.<a name=1:10></a>

		Talking matters over with Dr.<a name=1:11></a> E.<a name=1:12></a> and Mr.<a name=1:13></a> S.<a name=1:14></a> the possibility of our visiting South Africa and Australasia in 1936 is becoming clearer in our minds.<a name=1:15></a> The Glasgow meetings being early -- May 12th to 14th -- we could sail late in May or early June from England for South Africa, stay a short time there and get to Perth about July 15th.<a name=1:16></a> Then work through Australia, say two or three months; then New Zealand, getting to America in November or December, all under the Lord's good hand.<a name=1:17></a> If you visit South Africa during the coming winter or spring and return to England from there, you could, under the Lord's guidance, go to New Zealand and Australia via America.<a name=1:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The voyage is so far fairly good and we are enjoying the time together -- reading John 13 - 17.<a name=1:19></a>

		My Dear Brother, -- Your letter was received as I arrived here a week ago, but I am sorry to say it became mislaid through stress of circumstances, so I can but reply from memory of what it contained.<a name=1:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My remarks as to the 'care meeting' were general and had reference to administrative matters; that is, what regularly requires discipline or affects fellowship; in a word, matters which require collective authority.<a name=1:31></a> Much can be done based on <i>confidence</i> in a brother; for instance, need arising suddenly would be met on this principle.<a name=1:32></a> What a brother might do, manifestly right, would be accepted as approved of God.<a name=1:33></a> Also the giving of letters of commendation -- such a service is
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=2>[Page 2]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		usually left to a brother morally fitted for it.<a name=2:1></a> All are committed to what he does on the principle of confidence which love for one another implies.<a name=2:2></a> Thus the saints, being characteristically children of wisdom, serve one another in a local and general sense, in this way ministering pleasure to God.<a name=2:3></a> Much of this service enters into what is called the 'care meeting' and can thus be carried into effect without formal reference to the assembly.<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But brothers together for 'care' have no collective administrative authority -- at least I know of no scriptural warrant for this.<a name=2:5></a> Indeed the scriptural basis for brothers' care meetings needs generally enquiring _into.<a name=2:6></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#15">Acts  15</a>is, I think, the scripture that may be fairly regarded as furnishing this -- perhaps the only one in a direct sense.<a name=2:7></a> The <i>whole</i> procedure in this chapter cannot apply today, for it is apostolic and metropolitan.<a name=2:8></a> We have no apostles now, nor an earthly metropolis owned of God.<a name=2:9></a> But what does apply is the principle in the chapter of brothers coming together to <i>consider</i> a matter, verse 6.<a name=2:10></a> Then another principle is seen in verse 22; that is, that after the mind of God is brought in <i>during the consideration</i> (verses 7 - 21), the assembly is identified with the results reached.<a name=2:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To make the procedure apply today we must omit the part taken by "the apostles and elders" (verse 22), their place in verse 6 being simply that of <i>brothers;</i> so that what remains for authoritative action is the assembly, the Holy Spirit being in in verse 28.<a name=2:12></a> In order to get the full benefit of the example supplied in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#15">Acts  15</a>for present use we must also omit the great question actually dealt with, substituting it by any matter properly belonging to local assembly administration.<a name=2:13></a> Thus we have the brothers <i>considering or deliberating</i> and the assembly acting <i>authoritatively</i>.<a name=2:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1 and 2 Corinthians are intended specially to instruct us as to the assembly, in its general aspect, indeed, but particularly as to its local setting.<a name=2:15></a> It is God's assembly in Corinth or in any other city or place.<a name=2:16></a> He is identified with it, in it indeed, and it acts for Him and in His power.<a name=2:17></a> Elders are <i>not</i> mentioned evidently to stress the assembly itself -- that it functions organically and administratively.<a name=2:18></a> Viewed in a general sense, the specific gifts are said to be set in it by God.<a name=2:19></a> And it is significantly stated that the least esteemed in it are to be employed judicially.<a name=2:20></a> This shows inferentially that young brothers, or brothers regarded as of small account, are not to
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=3>[Page 3]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		be excluded from deliberative meetings.<a name=3:1></a> In principle all are responsible and the young should b e made to recognise this, with the provision that one "weak in the faith" is not to be received to the determining of questions of reasoning.<a name=3:2></a> The younger brothers learn as they have opportunity of seeing how divine wisdom manifests itself in those who are older and have more experience (see <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#5:1">1 Peter  5:1</a> - 7).<a name=3:3></a> The address to the angel in each of the seven assemblies (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2">Revelation  2</a>, 3) implies this general responsibility.<a name=3:4></a> There is, of course, full room for the exercise of eldership in the measure in which it may exist in any meeting for the care of the Lord's interests.<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Corinthian epistles, as already said, are intended to teach us as to the place the local assembly has in the divine economy, and as remarked, it is noteworthy that elders are not mentioned in them.<a name=3:6></a> Over against this, the frequent reference to the assembly is striking.<a name=3:7></a> It is seen as the temple of God, chapter 3; as administrating discipline, chapter 5; in relation to fellowship, chapter 10; in relation to the Lord's supper, chapter 11; in relation to the general testimony, chapter 12; in relation to ministry, chapter 14; in relation to collections for known needs, <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#8">2 Corinthians  8</a>.<a name=3:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is clear, therefore, that all matters requiring collective authority should be dealt with finally in the assembly.<a name=3:9></a> This would include discipline, whether involving withdrawal or what may be less serious; also the extension of fellowship to companies of christians in other localities, or the withdrawal of fellowship from such companies.<a name=3:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I trust the above will be clear and that it may be serviceable to you.<a name=3:11></a> My wife unites in love in Christ to Mrs.<a name=3:12></a> Young, you, and to all your family.<a name=3:13></a>

		Beloved Brother, -- I received two letters from you since I arrived in New York -- the one sent to the Britannic did not reach it.<a name=4:19></a> This morning on arrival here I received your cable as to Newcastle.<a name=4:20></a> I need not say that it cheers me much and I take it as an answer to prayer.<a name=4:21></a> I trust nothing will prevent the desired end -- that most of the brethren -- all in time, I trust -- may be together in righteousness and peace.<a name=4:22></a> My prayers will go up as before.<a name=4:23></a> It was very good of you to cable.<a name=4:24></a>

		Beloved Brother, -- While visiting the brethren on the Pacific Coast, I learned of your great sorrow, and now that I have returned to New York I send a line to express to you and your dear children the deep sympathy of my wife and myself.<a name=5:31></a> We were distressed when we heard that your beloved wife was taken from you and now seek, as before God, that your sorrow may be turned into joy.<a name=5:32></a> He will work for you three in this way, but in the meantime His thought is that the sorrow may be <i>felt</i>.<a name=5:33></a>

		As you will be aware, I know something of your present feelings and I know too, how the Lord comes in in such circumstances.<a name=5:34></a> There will be the pressure of loneliness and a void, which seems impossible to fill; but He who causes it <i>intends</i> to fill it, and will do so as His adjusting process is <i>permitted</i> to proceed.<a name=5:35></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#11">John  11</a>shows this both in Martha and Mary.<a name=5:36></a> Christ came into the vision of the former as He had not been hitherto apprehended <i>before</i> Lazarus was raised.<a name=5:37></a> She came into the light of "the Christ, the Son of God, who should come into the world".<a name=5:38></a> Adjustment is constantly needed by us and the sorrow of bereavement effects excellent soil for this.<a name=5:39></a>

		Beloved Brother, -- I have to thank you for letters dated August 30th and September 9th.<a name=6:13></a> I note all your comments as to Newcastle with great interest.<a name=6:14></a> In a letter from Mr.<a name=6:15></a> T------ received recently I learnt with thankfulness that you visited Newcastle.<a name=6:16></a> The brethren evidently were much cheered by your visit and service.<a name=6:17></a> I am thankful Wallsend made no objection.<a name=6:18></a> Having seen an account of the meeting of the brethren in the district at Wallsend by Mr.<a name=6:19></a> W------ and one by Mr.<a name=6:20></a> C------ , I can quite understand how you could send the cable which was so encouraging.<a name=6:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is clear to me from these accounts and from what has been expressed by several during the past few months that the voice of "the priests the sons of Levi" (<a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#21">Deuteronomy  21</a>) has been heard.<a name=6:22></a> It was no question of the brethren of the district settling the matter, but that the mind of God through priestly exercises has been made clear.<a name=6:23></a> Mr.<a name=6:24></a> C------ gives the remarks of a certain brother which he says were 'said in power, and from that moment the voice of the Lord was heard from quite a few brethren'.<a name=6:25></a> He then gives in detail what these brethren said, and it comports with what has been before many of us as light governing the position in Newcastle.<a name=6:26></a> If the priestly judgment has been reached, as I have no doubt it has, it is for Wallsend according to <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#21">Deuteronomy  21</a>, to follow it out and make it effective.<a name=6:27></a> If they do not they are failing in responsibility and cannot be henceforth regarded as holding the matter in their hands.<a name=6:28></a> Recent information indicates that they are not following out what the Lord has indicated, and this adds to the knowledge already possessed, that they have
	</div>

	</div>

		been wanting throughout in priestly intelligence and sensibilities as to the whole matter.<a name=7:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thanks for all the marine information you have sent.<a name=7:2></a> I certainly appreciate much all the pains you take on my account.<a name=7:3></a> If it seems the Lord's will that we should visit the Antipodes next year, we should like to spend the Easter in America, and hence shall not be present at the Belfast meetings.<a name=7:4></a> We should like to sail from this side shortly after Easter in good time for the Glasgow meetings, and then start for South Africa toward the end of May or the beginning of June.<a name=7:5></a> Possibly a good boat from New York to Great Britain can be found to fit in with this arrangement.<a name=7:6></a>

		Dear Brother, -- Thanks for yours of the 4th inst.<a name=7:15></a> with copy of my letter enclosed.<a name=7:16></a> I also received by the same mail certain information from other sources that I wrote for.<a name=7:17></a> Having weighed all, as I trust before the Lord, my judgment as to the position of Mr.<a name=7:18></a> K------ and those with him is that it is untenable and should be abandoned at once by all in it as unsupported by scriptural principles.<a name=7:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Besides your letter, I earlier received a letter from Mr.<a name=7:20></a> K------ , and the burden of his letter is that there was a bad state at Halfway-Tree when the discipline against W------ was exercised and that this practically disqualified them to take such a course.<a name=7:21></a> This is the ground you take, and no doubt it is shared in by all those who are with Mr.<a name=7:22></a> K------ , and I believe is the explanation of the great sorrow that has transpired at Kingston.<a name=7:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To assume that a meeting is not in a state to exercise discipline, is to assume that there are no assembly conditions there and the meeting is undeserving of being recognised as in fellowship.<a name=7:24></a> Neither Mr.<a name=7:25></a> K------'s letter to me, nor yours, furnish any evidence that Halfway-Tree should be regarded in this way.<a name=7:26></a> Mr.<a name=7:27></a> K------'s judgment and what Mr.<a name=7:28></a> Besley and Mr.<a name=7:29></a> Ralph are reported to have said (the reports given of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=8>[Page 8]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Messrs.<a name=8:1></a> Besley and Ralph are strongly contested by competent witnesses in Kingston) cannot be regarded as sufficient evidence of the bad state at Halfway-Tree.<a name=8:2></a> The judgment of brothers rendered in this way is too vague, save as substantiated by actual facts.<a name=8:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But <i>assuming</i> that Halfway-Tree was in a bad state, this, as I have already said to you, cannot be adduced as a reason why discipline against a specific sin should not be administered.<a name=8:4></a> The epistles to Corinth show unmistakably that not only was the assembly at Corinth in a bad state in the sense in which Mr K------ regards Halfway-Tree, but there were actually other wicked persons in the meeting as the twelfth chapter of the second Epistle shows.<a name=8:5></a> As to this, Mr.<a name=8:6></a> K------ says, 'I cannot conceive the Corinthians reading an inspired epistle from the pen of the apostle Paul and not being reduced to mourning'.<a name=8:7></a> This remark is quite irrelevant.<a name=8:8></a> If the apostle had said in directing them to exercise discipline against the wicked person named, that they should not do so until they were humbled by his letter, then Mr.<a name=8:9></a> K------'s remark would be in order, but the apostle says nothing of the kind.<a name=8:10></a> It is true that the apostle in his spirit had part in the discipline, as he says, "Ye and my spirit being gathered together", but he makes no provision that they should be humbled by his letter before they should do this.<a name=8:11></a> It is true that the Corinthians were affected by the apostle's first letter, but we cannot say much as to what spirit they were in when they executed the discipline on the wicked person.<a name=8:12></a> The point is that the apostle <i>insisted on their doing it without stipulating that they must first be in a certain state</i>.<a name=8:13></a> In chapter 5 he mentions his own spirit and the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, but in verse 13 he says, "remove the wicked person from amongst yourselves".<a name=8:14></a> This was their obligation whatever their state.<a name=8:15></a> The action would tend to remove the bad state; they were so far acting in obedience, and would be challenged as to themselves by what they were doing.<a name=8:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It may be remarked further that <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#12">2 Corinthians  12</a>, shows that even after the first letter was received the general state of the assembly could not be said to be good; far otherwise, for the apostle mournfully contemplates that there were still there persons who had committed fornication and licentiousness and had <i>not repented</i>.<a name=8:17></a> I regard, therefore, the attitude of Mr.<a name=8:18></a> K------ and those who are with him in regard to the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=9>[Page 9]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		discipline against Mr.<a name=9:1></a> W------ as tending to set aside the truth of assembly discipline, for it requires that the greatest evil must be left unjudged because of an alleged bad state in a given assembly.<a name=9:2></a> Your view is contrary to the plainest facts presented in first and second Corinthians as to discipline.<a name=9:3></a>

		Having shown from first and second Corinthians that a low or bad state in a meeting should not disallow an act of discipline against known evil there, I need not comment on what Mr.<a name=9:13></a> K------ , as followed by you, has said as to Judges.<a name=9:14></a> Of course, brethren who execute discipline should recognise that they themselves should be self-judged, but this is another matter, and a most important one too; but to discredit an act of discipline against known evil because those who exercised it are assumed not to be in a good state is pernicious.<a name=9:15></a> Mr.<a name=9:16></a> K------'s letter and yours, as disregarding scriptural principles and facts as shown above, prove that you are not in a state to pronounce on the state of Halfway-Tree.<a name=9:17></a> Please do not consider that I am arbitrary or severe in saying this.<a name=9:18></a> It is proved by what I have said above, and if you accept it as before the Lord and judge yourselves, there will be deliverance for you from your present false position.<a name=9:19></a> As regards <a href="../bible/Judges.htm#20">Judges  20</a>, 21, while Israel being in a bad state suffered under the government of God, yet the judgment they attempted was not condemned by God.<a name=9:20></a> It was eventually effected by His help.<a name=9:21></a>

		I refer now to some further statements in your letter of August 19th.<a name=9:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In regard to your charge that some 'chuckers-out' were employed, what I wrote to you from England is sustained by reliable information from Kingston.<a name=9:23></a> As regards your report of what Mr.<a name=9:24></a> Ralph said as to this, a letter from Halfway-Tree reads as follows: --
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=10>[Page 10]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'Mr.<a name=10:1></a> Ralph emphatically denies having said to P------ what he states.<a name=10:2></a> What he did say was to this effect -- It was regretful that such means had to be used, but under the circumstances the brethren were right in keeping the intruders out in this way'.<a name=10:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This agrees with my own judgment of the matter, and I cannot, therefore, share in your attitude, especially as it seems that you have exaggerated the facts.<a name=10:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards the matter of sin which had been hidden for so long, information that I have received from Kingston confirms what I wrote to you from England including Mr.<a name=10:5></a> K------'s part in it.<a name=10:6></a> It would appear that the other two brothers in question were disciplined for concealing the matter, and hence the case should have been considered as closed, and should not be brought up now.<a name=10:7></a> It is most difficult for brethren at a distance to form a judgment of a case of this kind seeing so much detail enters into it.<a name=10:8></a> Brethren at a distance, therefore, rightly accept what the local meeting may do in such a case.<a name=10:9></a> To bring it up, after it is ostensibly settled, to cause it to bear on other things is manifestly not of God.<a name=10:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You pretend to judge the state of a meeting as bad which is accredited as in fellowship with saints generally, and yet your own state is shown to be bad by the way you write about your brethren.<a name=10:11></a> You must pardon me, my dear brother, for writing you in this way, but I do so to save you from a false position.<a name=10:12></a> Your letters to me prove that your state is not such as to qualify you to take the part you are taking as to the holy things of God.<a name=10:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having carefully looked into your letters and that of Mr.<a name=10:14></a> K------ and others with you, I cannot but accept the signed testimony issued by the brethren in Kingston with whom I am breaking bread.<a name=10:15></a> The fact that a good number sided with Mr.<a name=10:16></a> K------ at the time of the discipline meeting did not prove that he was right or unworthy of the discipline proposed to be executed against him.<a name=10:17></a> His views as to discipline, and his opposition to what was done at Halfway-Tree resulting in a wide cleavage in the meetings constituted him as a causer of division with heretical characteristics, and hence he and those who acted with him could not be regarded as fit for fellowship.<a name=10:18></a> The action of the brothers at the time of the discipline meeting was one of <i>withdrawal</i> from evil, and no number, however large, on the side of the evil can invalidate this.<a name=10:19></a> The number

	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		supporting the withdrawal is, I understand, much larger than that of those refusing it.<a name=11:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards your statement 'that the necessity for exercising discipline on Mr.<a name=11:2></a> W------ has never been called in question by Mr.<a name=11:3></a> K------ or any of his', I quote from a letter just received from Halfway-Tree: --
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'It is <i>not</i> correct, for to my personal knowledge K------ , B------ , H------ , and P------ maintained for quite a while that they did not see any necessity for W------ to be disciplined.<a name=11:4></a> It was only when W------ started to show such open lawlessness that they had to come to it .<a name=11:5></a>.<a name=11:6></a>.<a name=11:7></a> .<a name=11:8></a> P------ himself wrote a letter in 1930 to our brother D------ , now gone to be with the Lord, demanding that W------ should be received again without any questioning, and K------ told a brother that W------ was in a better state than anyone at Halfway-Tree and should be received when we resumed the breaking of bread'.<a name=11:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As this flat denial of your statement corresponds with the general principle Mr.<a name=11:10></a> K------ and you all hold as to the action at Halfway-Tree, it is difficult not to accept it as generally true.<a name=11:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I need not add more to this already long letter, but I assure you I am genuinely anxious to help you all, and I feel obliged from the general facts to speak plainly and strongly with a hope that the Lord may use what I write for the deliverance of you all from the false position you are in and restore you to your brethren.<a name=11:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I may add that I am sorry to learn that Mr.<a name=11:13></a> K------ is quite poorly, and I hope the Lord will restore him in his body as well as in his soul, so that he may be with his brethren and resume the same kind of profitable service he once rendered.<a name=11:14></a> He will forgive me for embodying my answer to his letter in my letter to you.<a name=11:15></a> This is so as to avoid unnecessary writing.<a name=11:16></a> You will, I am sure, show my letter to Mr.<a name=11:17></a> K------ if he is equal to reading it, and assure him of my love.<a name=11:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Beloved Brother, -- Scripture has much on the subject, but nothing, as far as I know, as to spiritual ministry as burials take place.<a name=12:27></a> The emphasis is on the act of burial, and those who bury.<a name=12:28></a> The purchase of the field at Machpelah with the cave, trees, etc.<a name=12:29></a>, would indicate the provision of accommodation for burial services; and no doubt these, as bringing God in, took place, but I cannot find any instructions as to them.<a name=12:30></a> Whereas we have much instruction as to the regular service of God -- in the New Testament we are taught as to prayer, worship, preaching, reading, ministry of the word in the assembly, etc.<a name=12:31></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=13>[Page 13]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, what we are to do at burials is a question for the children of wisdom to decide, each occasion calling for <i>its</i> particular requirements.<a name=13:1></a> The circumstances would govern this.<a name=13:2></a> In <i>this</i> city those attending funerals are <i>generally</i> saints nearly all known to each other, and we make no previous arrangement.<a name=13:3></a> The service is 'open' and there is little or no confusion.<a name=13:4></a> On the other hand, if a funeral is in a town where the saint buried was well known, and a large number of 'outside' people attend, and the saints decide that they should be specially in view in what may be said, the local saints perhaps not possessing ability for this, there is wisdom in obtaining the help of a brother of ability from another locality; or if a local brother has ability, there is wisdom in placing the service more or less in his hands.<a name=13:5></a> Certainly there is no gain, but the contrary, in a state of uncertainty, and a consequent long pause at such a time.<a name=13:6></a> But if those likely to attend a funeral are nearly all saints, known to each other as in fellowship, including those able to minister a word of comfort, and whatever else may be needed, they are showing their confidence in each other, and thus knowing the Lord and each other, in having the matter open -- indeed in the Lord's hands.<a name=13:7></a> But where the larger number present at a funeral are outside people, the saints being perhaps few, and the undertaker having only a limited time, the wise move is for a capable brother or brothers by mutual understanding to lead on.<a name=13:8></a> I believe the testimony is served in this way.<a name=13:9></a> The Lord would support such a procedure, and there will be no occasion for ridicule -- people saying they would 'much prefer a clergyman than endure such foolish delay'.<a name=13:10></a> Things are to be "done decently and in order" as Scripture says.<a name=13:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The position is -- a saint has to be buried; there is thus need or opportunity for a meeting.<a name=13:12></a> What is its character to be?<a name=13:13></a> If mainly for prayer and comfort for the bereaved, all knowing each other as in fellowship, the simple way, and which makes room for the Spirit is to be together humbly depending on the Lord.<a name=13:14></a> But if outside persons are mainly in view, an understanding as to who should take the lead is wiser.<a name=13:15></a> External requirements such as do not enter into any other meeting should ever be in view, as they render special provision imperative.<a name=13:16></a>

		Beloved Brother, -- Your letter of August 17th reached me in Vancouver and as a large proportion of my time since has been spent in travelling in the West, I have been hindered in correspondence.<a name=14:4></a> This will account for the somewhat long delay of my reply.<a name=14:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Your letter is of deep interest to me, having looked over it carefully.<a name=14:6></a> The subject treated is the greatest possible, and requires careful and prayerful thought.<a name=14:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe the Lord helped us during the recent months as to <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:17">John  20:17</a>.<a name=14:8></a> What is said of the Father, as for instance <a href="../bible/John.htm#5:22">John  5:22</a>, "For neither does the Father judge any one, but has given all judgment to the Son", shows plainly the relationship into which God has entered under this appellation is more limited than God in the Absolute sense.<a name=14:9></a> All divine attributes and prerogatives must refer unlimitedly to God as such.<a name=14:10></a> The term "Father" at the same time conveys the most blessed feature of God, for it implies family relationships and enjoyments, but manifestly in taking it God had in mind to become more intelligible to His creatures, for the relationship was already known as set in the human family from the outset.<a name=14:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What you say as to Hebrews is therefore correct, although the teaching <i>in the main is not on the same level</i> as Ephesians.<a name=14:12></a> Whilst we have the thought of the Father and the Son in Hebrews 2 the saints are scarcely brought into this relationship, and therefore there is not the same power contemplated to enter into divine thoughts as Ephesians presents, hence in Ephesians the power of apprehension (chapter 3) is by the Spirit of the Father.<a name=14:13></a> Besides this, Ephesians presents our place in the divine counsels both as individuals and as the assembly.<a name=14:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I wish to convey is, that while Hebrews has the full thought as regards service in mind, our relationship with God as Father, as in sonship presented in Ephesians, greatly enhances the truth presented in this epistle, and this of itself shows the end in view in the relationship of Father and Son which God has entered into.<a name=14:15></a> These blessed relationships afford more power to us as creatures to enter into the knowledge of God, and to respond fully to Him.<a name=14:16></a> Hence it is "glory to God in the assembly".<a name=14:17></a>

		The dear brethren in London are much on my heart I need not say, and in my prayers.<a name=15:2></a> I heard from P.<a name=15:3></a>L.<a name=15:4></a> of your first reading in Park Street, and I trust there will be steady help throughout the present series of meetings.<a name=15:5></a> At our monthly reading we are looking at the 'Wars of the Lord' and were helped of Him in considering <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15">Exodus  15</a>at the first one.<a name=15:6></a>

		As regards <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:26">John  17:26</a>, the love there is undoubtedly the Father's love for the Son.<a name=17:19></a> It is to be <i>in us</i>.<a name=17:20></a> It is the third kind of love that I would speak of as in the assembly, the first being the love of Christ expressed in the loaf in the Lord's supper; the second being the covenant love of God expressed in the cup, it being the blood of the new covenant; and the third the Father's love for the Son, which is also in us.<a name=17:21></a> The love in verse 26 is, I judge, the same as that in verse 23.<a name=17:22></a> Verse 24 seems to be personal to Himself, "Thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world".<a name=17:23></a> The glory referred to in this verse 24 seems also to be personal, whereas he speaks of <i>sharing</i> the glory given to him in verse 22.<a name=17:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would say, therefore, that verse 24 is personal in a general way, although it would not be wise to say it does not enter into verses 23 and 26.<a name=17:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is food and special spiritual formation in the soul meditating on these verses and noting the evident distinctions that are to be made.<a name=17:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As said above, I should not like to detach strictly the love of verse 24 from the love of verses 23 and 26, but I am sure we should recognise the distinction I have noted above, and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=18>[Page 18]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		this would imply that verse 24 is love between divine Persons as such in Deity.<a name=18:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards question number 3, the simple way is to regard all of the religious societies as just part of the world, and the apostle's remark in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5">1 Corinthians  5</a>would show that in regard of business and the like we are in the world.<a name=18:2></a> We are not here to alter or reform the world, and so we go through it in a general way without making distinctions.<a name=18:3></a> Thus you can see that a man ought to be free to transact business with persons belonging to these religious organisations without committing himself in any way to the organisations in a religious sense; but we are regarded as children of wisdom in Scripture, and we should be on our guard not to <i>seem</i> to support what is manifestly wrong.<a name=18:4></a> The exercised believer is enabled of God to use skill and avoid any appearance of evil.<a name=18:5></a>

		<a name=19>[Page 19]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		furnish you with a fair statement of facts, and I advise you to write him.<a name=19:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Briefly, the facts are that a state came about in the Newcastle meeting hardly describable for badness through accusations of criminality being made against Mr.<a name=19:2></a> M------ and others by Mr.<a name=19:3></a> W------ in relation to a partnership between Mr.<a name=19:4></a> D------ and Mr.<a name=19:5></a> M------ .<a name=19:6></a> I attended a meeting of brothers in Newcastle some three and a half years ago when the matter was discussed and the state disclosed was, as I said, beyond words to describe.<a name=19:7></a> I pointed out to the brethren present that assembly conditions did not exist.<a name=19:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Later three brothers -- Messrs.<a name=19:9></a> Davidson, Biggs and Malpas -- by arrangement, both sides of the controversy agreeing, went to Newcastle and investigated the data involved.<a name=19:10></a> Their investigation brought out that the evil -- false accusation of the most serious kind -- was on the side of W------ .<a name=19:11></a> He owned his error, but afterwards refused to stand by this.<a name=19:12></a> Most of the meeting refused 'the report' of the three brothers, the leader at the time, Mr.<a name=19:13></a> T------l, writing against it; and it was later said to be 'dead'.<a name=19:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As 'the report' -- being accredited testimony, and proving evil in the meeting -- was refused, nearly half of the saints withdrew and met at Eastwood, Mr.<a name=19:15></a> T------'s house.<a name=19:16></a> They thus proved themselves 'clear in the matter' of proved evil, and have maintained this.<a name=19:17></a> The course of the others, on the other hand, was confused and inconsistent.<a name=19:18></a> Acceptance of 'the report' began to be asserted by them; W------ was put under a kind of discipline; T------l withdrew, apparently judging his own course and that of those he had been associated with; although not long before this he had sought to incriminate me as refusing 'assembly action' because I had questioned the fairness of Wallsend's placing both sides on the same ground.<a name=19:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Later a large proportion of those with B------ , W------ , etc.<a name=19:20></a>, withdrew, and 13 brothers of them signed a paper condemning their previous position and justifying those at Eastwood in primarily withdrawing.<a name=19:21></a> P------ was one of these brothers.<a name=19:22></a> These, with those at Eastwood, now began to meet at the old room, as the others had vacated it.<a name=19:23></a> Afterwards P------ and those who had signed the paper above mentioned withdrew, speaking generally, each giving a different reason from the other.<a name=19:24></a> I saw all their letters and none of them, as far as I could see, afforded valid ground for withdrawing from their
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=20>[Page 20]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		brethren.<a name=20:1></a> Since, some of those who left have returned, I understand, but not P------ ; he and a brother named D------ have been seeking to show that the testimony of two or three witnesses is refused by those now in the old room.<a name=20:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards the judgment of Wallsend, 'the adjoining meeting' to which you refer, what has marked their part in the whole matter does not inspire confidence.<a name=20:3></a> First, they designated all at Newcastle on the same level as leprous, or words to this effect.<a name=20:4></a> The unfairness of this being pointed out, they modified their judgment, and later owned that those with Messrs.<a name=20:5></a> T------ and P------t were technically right, but that their moral condition was not right.<a name=20:6></a> Mr.<a name=20:7></a> K------ sent me two lengthy memoranda, one dealing with those at Eastwood and the other with those at that time at the old room, and the trend was to justify the latter and condemn the former, and last summer he wrote to Mr.<a name=20:8></a> T------t (the latter showed me the letter) saying they at Wallsend were not going to open the flood-gates of evil in recognising those with Messrs.<a name=20:9></a> T------ and P------t -- words to this effect.<a name=20:10></a> T------t, who has throughout supported Wallsend's attitude, told me last summer that those with Mr.<a name=20:11></a> T------ had long been opposers of the truth.<a name=20:12></a> I told him I had been visiting Newcastle, staying with Mr.<a name=20:13></a> T------ , for 25 years and that I could not accept such a charge.<a name=20:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In view of above, Wallsend's judgment cannot rightly be taken unquestioningly; nor is it supported generally by other adjacent meetings, including (as I understand) Jarrow, Sunderland, Darlington, W.<a name=20:15></a> Hartlepool.<a name=20:16></a> At a meeting in Wallsend of representative brothers from meetings in the district last August it was agreed ( 'one or two prejudiced persons dissenting' ) that 'our brethren at Wesley Street are standing on right ground, that we ask them to do all possible to get some of the difficulties which have been advanced solved .<a name=20:17></a>.<a name=20:18></a>.<a name=20:19></a> but further that we must be prepared, if it is not possible to remove these difficulties to accept the judgment of our brethren at Wesley Street as to these matters'.<a name=20:20></a> This was written by Mr.<a name=20:21></a> W------ , Darlington, and confirmed substantially to me by a letter from Mr.<a name=20:22></a> C------ , Glasgow, who was also present at the said meeting.<a name=20:23></a> If the brethren at Wesley Street are standing on right ground, and nothing tangible is advanced to prove that they are unfit for christian fellowship, they have a moral right (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:14">Revelation  22:14</a>) to take up their privileges which the judgment of Wallsend cannot deprive them of.<a name=20:24></a>

		of Newcastle.<a name=22:1></a> What has come to light for some, and will I believe come to light for the brethren generally, is that the difficulty has to be solved in <i>Newcastle</i>.<a name=22:2></a> If there are any 'approved' there in the midst of the general breakdown, the Lord will be with them, and will use them.<a name=22:3></a> It is for Israel's priests to discern if there are such and to stand by them at least morally, for the enemy will do all in his power to discredit them.<a name=22:4></a> The addresses to the assemblies in Revelation show that the principle of recovery is through <i>overcomers</i>.<a name=22:5></a> When the state of a meeting becomes such that all in it seem involved, or that the approved are not manifested, brethren in meetings near-by and generally are bound to protect themselves from contamination arising from such conditions, and love in the meeting nearest will not fail to manifest itself in wise gracious watchfulness and care generally, but as soon as there is any evidence of overcoming in the place affected, this must be recognised as morally the point of recovery.<a name=22:6></a> The Lord is in charge, as it were and the pursuit of righteousness, faith, love and peace in the saints generally will require that His rights, and the moral rights of His people in the city in question, must be observed.<a name=22:7></a> Under these circumstances it is manifestly wrong for a nearby meeting to assume an administrative control.<a name=22:8></a> The overcomer or overcomers in the city in question have <i>morally</i> the same status as meetings elsewhere.<a name=22:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The moral side of the matter is what is so important, and I believe it has not had its full place with those who, as outside Newcastle, have had to do directly with it.<a name=22:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		You will be aware that besides those meeting at Wesley Street, a group of brethren are now meeting in another place called Pilgrim Street.<a name=22:11></a> These have written recently to New York arraigning me for unwarrantedly convening a meeting in Newcastle some three and a half years ago, and of inviting brethren from other meetings to attend it.<a name=22:12></a> The truth is that I had been invited to Newcastle for special meetings at that time and before reaching Newcastle Mr.<a name=22:13></a> T------ had suggested that I should meet the brethren in relation to the then great sorrow that was current amongst them.<a name=22:14></a> Before agreeing I wrote to Mr.<a name=22:15></a> T------l, who was then very prominent and active as you will know, at Newcastle, and he did not agree with the suggestion but wished me to meet the brethren at his house in regard of a nearby meeting that had recently been formed.<a name=22:16></a> I did not accede to Mr.<a name=22:17></a> T------l's wish, feeling that the local conditions

		at Newcastle did not admit of such a meeting as he proposed, and so the matter was left until I reached Newcastle.<a name=23:1></a> On my arrival there I found conditions so bad that I called up Mr.<a name=23:2></a> T------l on the phone and told him that I would like to see the brethren after the address in keeping with Mr.<a name=23:3></a> T------'s suggestion, as I did not wish to leave Newcastle without placing my exercises briefly on their consciences.<a name=23:4></a> Mr.<a name=23:5></a> T------l agreed and arranged for the meeting.<a name=23:6></a> Others who attended the meeting, such as Messrs.<a name=23:7></a> N------ , T------ t and C------ were there as having been present at the fellowship meetings, and as far as I remember all were happy about their presence.<a name=23:8></a> So much for their charge that I convened a meeting of brothers on my own account.<a name=23:9></a> Two months later Messrs.<a name=23:10></a> Davidson, Biggs and Malpas went to Newcastle by arrangement with the contending brothers, W------ and M------ , and their investigation of the books disclosed that W------ had made serious <i>false</i> charges against M------ .<a name=23:11></a> From that time to this the question of good and evil has been in conflict in Newcastle, and I have not a doubt that those meeting at Wesley Street have been and are on the side of the good.<a name=23:12></a>

		Beloved Brother, -- Here in New York we have much to do with this kind of thing, and invariably we find the Lord's approval and support in refusing to receive persons who are linked up in this way until such links are severed; and in some cases where the sister or brother is in fellowship and he proceeds to get married we have withdrawn from him.<a name=27:22></a> "In the Lord" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#7">1 Corinthians  7</a>), is unquestionably more than simply that the person in question is a christian.<a name=27:23></a> It implies recognition

		The news you send of Newcastle grieves me for I had heard of the purposed meeting of February 29th, and had hoped Wallsend was moving in the right direction.<a name=30:5></a> The reason for the cancellation of the meeting which you understood, namely, that Wesley Street brethren could not break bread with Mr.<a name=30:6></a> P------ and Mr.<a name=30:7></a> D------ , is, if correct, MOST distressing.<a name=30:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is quite invalid as a cause for the abandonment of a meeting of brethren to consider a matter of such solemnity and extensive importance.<a name=30:9></a> The proposal would be the outcome of serious exercise before the Lord, not only at Wallsend but wherever the matter was known by brethren, and there would be solemn urgent waiting on God about it in the gatherings invited to attend.<a name=30:10></a> I cannot conceive of such a meeting without such exercises preceding it, and hence the abandonment of it causes deep concern.<a name=30:11></a> It seems wanting of priestly gravity and balance.<a name=30:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The fact that Wesley Street would not at the time break bread with Mr.<a name=30:13></a> P------ and Mr.<a name=30:14></a> D------ would, of course, be the occasion of enquiry at the meeting, but this is now a matter properly belonging to Wesley Street.<a name=30:15></a> Those at Wesley Street (formerly Eastwood) have proved themselves clear of the evil exposed in the old meeting, having consistently stood against it from the outset of its exposure, and are recognised, even by Wallsend, as clear in the matter, certainly by brethren generally who know the facts.<a name=30:16></a> The Lord owns them on this ground and would help them as to maters within their local responsibility, hence the reception of those two brothers should be left with them.<a name=30:17></a> The history of those brothers in relation to the whole difficulty makes this clearer.<a name=30:18></a> They identified themselves with those now at Pilgrim Street among whom the evil was exposed, later they left them, returning to those at Wesley Street (then at Eastwood), formally owning them as right; and then withdrew from them without scriptural warrant.<a name=30:19></a> They attacked them jointly in a circulated letter, and later again returned, at least P------ did, I am not sure whether D------ did.<a name=30:20></a> That such

		Beloved Brother, -- Having seen a copy of the letter written by brethren at Jarrow to those-at Wallsend dated February 25th, I send a line to say that I am thankful that you could thus write.<a name=32:18></a> Your comments on <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#21">Deuteronomy  21</a>are according to truth and I am assured that our brethren generally will in time own this; indeed the position in Newcastle is much clearer in the minds of the saints than it was nine months ago, which shows unmistakably that God is working towards the solution of this sorrowful matter.<a name=32:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The fact that the brethren at Wallsend are not practically according to those at Wesley Street which is due, does not at all minimise the responsibility of the rest of us to recognise it: this is obvious.<a name=32:20></a> Thus Israel's elders and judges are still in the attitude of having of having <i>gone forth</i> and that of the priests as having "come near".<a name=32:21></a> Wallsend having failed to act as priests and speak thus for all Israel does not imply that the <i>principle</i> of the nearest city cannot be operative.<a name=32:22></a> The <i>priests</i> have already drawn <i>near</i> and spiritually this is how it works out.<a name=32:23></a> It may be immediately through those at Jarrow or other nearby meetings, but it is the obligation of the saints generally to recognise -- not only in word but in practice -- the rights of the saints in Wesley Street, also the Lord's rights in them.<a name=32:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At the meeting of brothers in the district in September, Wesley Street's rights were verbally owned and any further

		<a name=33>[Page 33]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		enquiry should <i>start with this fact</i>.<a name=33:1></a> If brothers come to see that failure to own practically the manifest rights of their brethren is unrighteous, the seriousness of our position will be apparent.<a name=33:2></a> It is important to keep clearly in mind that brothers in the Newcastle district coming together to make enquiry or take counsel is a priestly matter, not an ecclesiastical one, and it owns the principle of proximity.<a name=33:3></a> Some, I understand, have quoted me as saying that a district meeting is unscriptural but this -- whatever the quotation-could refer only to assembly status; brothers in a district coming together as spiritual -- as priests -- to enquire or take counsel, is scriptural.<a name=33:4></a>

		Beloved Brother, -- Your allusions to Westfield cause me the deepest concern.<a name=34:12></a> It is <i>now</i> the outstanding difficulty, Judaism is there again -- the endeavour to justify partisan and personal feeling under the guise of local privilege.<a name=34:13></a> When the restrictions attempted on ------'s service to the Lord came up, I was told by brothers at Westfield that there was no charge pending against him, and that his status in the 'assembly' was the same as all others.<a name=34:14></a> I then pointed out that if ------ had ability from the Lord to serve the saints this was not merely local but of a universal bearing, and any effort to restrict it would interfere with the Lord's rights.<a name=34:15></a> This was not denied and hence I thought the difficulty would ease off.<a name=34:16></a> I also pointed out strongly that any attempt to discipline or restrict a brother by a group of brothers -- however many -- was contrary to assembly order.<a name=34:17></a> This also was assented to, as I remember Mr.<a name=34:18></a> ------ saying ------ should be free to carry on his service, and that he had good hope matters would be adjusted on this basis.<a name=34:19></a> But the Montreal correspondence which I have seen shows that the truth governing the matter is being disregarded by the group of brothers I spoke to -- then they numbered about five, now 'nine' I see.<a name=34:20></a> They may say they only answered an enquiry, but they did this with a <i>manifest intent to restrict</i>.<a name=34:21></a> Under such circumstances wisdom would answer Montreal by saying that ------ was in fellowship at Westfield taking part freely in assembly services and hence there could be no question as to his taking part similarly at Montreal.<a name=34:22></a> This is quite obvious.<a name=34:23></a> Personal feelings, seeing the brother's general assembly status was owned, should not be mentioned.<a name=34:24></a>

		Such feelings should not be put forward as of more importance than those of the assembly or as affecting the <i>general</i> status of a servant.<a name=35:1></a> Their mention by ------ to the brethren at Detroit so affected the brethren that a reading was spoiled.<a name=35:2></a> Wise handling of matters would avoid such results.<a name=35:3></a> If a brother's local setting is owned as right generally, wisdom would leave him with the Lord in the exercise of his service to Him.<a name=35:4></a> To his own master he stands or falls.<a name=35:5></a> A group of brothers interfering with him is manifestly wrong.<a name=35:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the attitude of these brothers at Westfield towards ------ , brethren in other meetings are bound to be fair; he has rights equal to the other brothers.<a name=35:7></a> They say 'he should be acceptable to us' but each of them should be acceptable to him.<a name=35:8></a> To <i>my knowledge</i> they have acted most unfairly to him at times ------ tells me that in a care meeting lately he has pointed out to them the unfair things that I refer to, but could get no acknowledgement of them.<a name=35:9></a> Whatever may be said to the contrary, I am not considering for ------ because is my relative.<a name=35:10></a> I am concerned <i>entirely</i> that right principle should prevail amongst us.<a name=35:11></a> That there may be ways in ------ that irritate his brethren I do not deny, but having followed the whole matter closely I know of nothing in him so provocative as certain attitudes and procedures that I have seen in the other brothers at Westfield.<a name=35:12></a> If the brothers at Westfield wish to promote local and general peace and confidence they must in seeking to have matters with ------ adjusted own all they can to him, leaving with the Lord what they object to in him, unless they can prove some evil.<a name=35:13></a> In dealing with our brothers in this sense we are enjoined to consider ourselves.<a name=35:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The quotation from a paper of mine in the Westfield letter to Montreal involves a moral defect, for 1 had strongly urged on the writer the unscripturalness of his attitude towards ------ .<a name=35:15></a> That he had certain exercises as to ------ (as ------ has of him, I and others have too) I can understand, but circulating such personal exercises or feelings among gatherings outside so as to restrict ------'s service is manifestly wrong.<a name=35:16></a> The quotation from 'The Assembly' contemplates normal conditions, such as at Antioch -- not a group of brothers acting on their own account.<a name=35:17></a>

		The new covenant is, of course, the heart of the epistle, followed, as it is, by reconciliation: new creation also touched on.<a name=41:23></a> The truth presented in this order, as it is in the epistle, is peculiarly calculated to touch us, moving us towards God and

		My Dear Jim, -- I need not say how thankful to God I am for the cable 'Letters charges Westfield withdrawn'.<a name=44:19></a> Not having heard anything since August 16th as to special meetings held I had feared that no satisfactory result had been reached.<a name=44:20></a> But we continued to cry to God, for seeing that attention had been called -- as before the Lord -- to the errors made, a serious situation would ensue if a deaf ear was definitely turned to the testimony rendered.<a name=44:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think I mentioned in an earlier letter that in view of the natural relationship existing I did not press the withdrawal of

	<div class="paragraph">
		the two serious charges which without proof appeared in the New York letter to Westfield, counting that the Lord would overrule and bring the brethren to an acknowledgement of the truth in time; but the feelings shown and course pursued in Westfield supported by some in New York forced the conclusion that the Lord would have the matter faced.<a name=45:1></a> I had hoped, however, that my address on February 22nd and private remarks to brothers in Westfield and New York would lead, under God, to a steady adjustment; but instead of this, things became worse.<a name=45:2></a> Mr.<a name=45:3></a> ------ had assured me that there would be an adjustment before I sailed, but the Montreal correspondence which followed killed any hopes based on this I had.<a name=45:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus when brethren in New York indicated that an inquiry should be entered upon I felt the Lord's hand was in it and I looked incessantly to Him, at the same time conveying my own mind in letters from time to time.<a name=45:5></a> I was bound to do this as directly responsible, being resident in New York.<a name=45:6></a> Had I realised a year ago, as I do now, how matters stood it is likely I should have laid my exercises definitely before the New York brethren.<a name=45:7></a>

		I am uncertain as to what 'charges Westfield' covers, but assume that the two charges in the New York letter to Westfield, to which attention had been drawn, and the Montreal letters are included.<a name=45:8></a> At any rate it is clear that a substantial result has been reached and we thank God as will brethren generally who know the facts.<a name=45:9></a>

		P.S.<a name=47:10></a> -- I believe that a brother, when required to join a trade union, should explain his reason as before God for not doing so, quoting Scripture.<a name=47:11></a> It is not unlikely that if this were courageously done by all with respect and humility, those in authority would take notice of it, and under God a change might come about.<a name=47:12></a> Every true christian sympathises with the working man and wishes him to obtain a fair recompense for his labour, but trade unionism in principle requires that he should join it whatever his conscience, or else starve, or perhaps die by violence by its hand.<a name=47:13></a> Does the Government of New Zealand really understand that it is legalising the anti-christian principle?<a name=47:14></a>

		My Dear ------ , -- Your letter of August 27th grieves me, not because it bears against me, but for your own sake and for the truth's sake, for I see by it that you retain the spirit that "sows discord among brethren" to which I referred in the letter of mine you saw.<a name=49:15></a> I had heard you had owned to wrong in contending against a brother, against whom there was no charge of evil pending, being invited to preach the gospel in Flatbush by one whose responsibility it was to invite for this service those who can render it, but your letter seeks to justify your conduct.<a name=49:16></a> To contend against a brother able to preach the gospel and whom God had used in that service, and against whom there was no charge, being allowed to do it and to enlist others in the same opposition is to cause discord and division among the brethren, and your defence of your conduct shows that the guilt of that remains attached to you.<a name=49:17></a> The Lord is not overlooking this.<a name=49:18></a>

		The 'brothers' conference' is just over and we are all much cheered by the good time the Lord granted us.<a name=53:4></a> Brothers were here from the different meetings in New Zealand by personal invitation, as in England, as accommodation is not available for a general invitation -- about 500 brothers met at the five readings on the subject of the Spirit in <a href="../bible/1and.htm#2">1 and  2</a>Corinthians.<a name=53:5></a> Besides these there was a reading for <i>all</i> on the Lord's Day afternoon on 'assembly procedure' -- <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24">Luke  24</a>and <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>.<a name=53:6></a> The addresses were by W.<a name=53:7></a>J.<a name=53:8></a>H.<a name=53:9></a>, P.<a name=53:10></a>L.<a name=53:11></a> (gospel), J.<a name=53:12></a>T.<a name=53:13></a> and A.<a name=53:14></a>M.<a name=53:15></a>H.<a name=53:16></a> The Lord graciously helped throughout -- the readings on 1 and 2 Corinthians as encouraging as any I have attended.<a name=53:17></a> About 70 came from Australia, including ourselves and one or two from England.<a name=53:18></a> I cabled above briefly to White Street.<a name=53:19></a> The 'conference' extended over four days and since then we have had an address and two readings in which we also realised the gracious help of the Lord.<a name=53:20></a> A good proportion of the visiting brethren have remained until today, when most, including those from Australia, will leave.<a name=53:21></a> We go to Christchurch by steamer tonight, God willing, for meetings there and in the South Island generally.<a name=53:22></a> On November 18th we return to the North Island and go North for meetings until December 12th when, the Lord permitting, we sail for Los Angeles by the Mariposa, hoping to arrive on December 26th.<a name=53:23></a> If meetings are arranged at Chicago, as Uncle George intimated, we shall not reach New York until about January 10th.<a name=53:24></a>

		brother, in Westfield at the time serving the Lord and His people, and to exclude him from deliberations affecting the assembly locally and generally was the substitution of human wisdom for divine wisdom; and the histories of Joseph, Joshua, Samuel, Solomon, Timothy, and many other young men, shows that the shutting out of young brothers from care meetings is not according to the mind of God.<a name=54:1></a>

		Then as to the general procedure of Westfield, the New York letter of last year was an elaborately prepared indictment by an "assembly" of a brother in another assembly, i.<a name=54:2></a>e.<a name=54:3></a>, an assembly entering on the province and doing the work of another assembly; whereas what is scriptural and orderly in such a case is for the brother or brothers to present the accredited evidence to the assembly in which the supposed guilty brother is and leave the disciplinary service with it.<a name=54:4></a> If the latter assembly refuses to act and thus refuses to judge and clear itself of evil in its midst, then other assemblies must refuse fellowship with it so as to keep themselves clear, leaving the unfaithful assembly in the Lord's hands and waiting on Him to come in for it.<a name=54:5></a> Westfield received this indictment without protest and acted on it in spite of facts mentioned above and more particularly in spite of its knowledge that the indictment contained two serious unproved charges, and also knowing that <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18">Matthew  18</a>, as part of "the law of the house" governing the matter, had been disregarded.<a name=54:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		Disciplinary proceedings were entered on in June, 1935, against ------ in relation to his visit to Knoxville and Miami sometime previously.<a name=61:6></a> The New York brethren -- I was in England at the time -- wrote to Westfield an indictment of ------ in which were several charges unsupported by proof (New York has since withdrawn their letter owning with sorrow the false charges and other errors) and Westfield received this without protest and read it 'in assembly', and proceeded to adjudicate on it, <i>without giving the accused an opportunity to state his side of the matter</i>.<a name=61:7></a> The deliberations extended over seven weeks, but ------ was debarred throughout.<a name=61:8></a> Then <i>after</i> the case was concluded, ------ being set free formally 'in assembly' a <i>group</i> of the brothers at Westfield began to restrict him in his service, locally and generally, saying they were not <i>free</i>, although they fully owned that his status in the meeting was the same as theirs.<a name=61:9></a> I had to say to this side of the matter, pointing out to those brothers that they were interfering with the Lord's right in His service.<a name=61:10></a>

		Thus matters stood until last summer, when the Lord began to work and New York withdrew their letters as wrong, but Westfield refused to own <i>their</i> part in the evil, while <i>professing</i> to be thankful for New York's action.<a name=61:11></a> Then some brothers at Westfield got light and owned openly <i>their</i> part in the wrong-doings, so that a good proportion of the meeting came round to what is right, but ------ and two other leading brothers persistently refused to acknowledge any wrong, and last week issued a long written statement intended to justify their whole course in the matter -- there is not one acknowledgement in it.<a name=61:12></a> The few who are with God in the matter saw there was nothing left but to clear the Lord's name of such a course and attitude of self-will and so they came together 'in

		As you can understand, this sorrow at Westfield has weighed heavily upon me and does still; not only because of the loss for the moment of a good few saints in Westfield, but that there has been disclosed such disregard for the truth, and that personal feeling and prejudice have run so high as to lead brethren, who should be intelligent in the truth of God, and of moral uprightness, to refuse to own their part in wrong-doing,

		which is as plainly attested as possible in such a case.<a name=63:1></a> ------ wrote to me that the things required of them to own by the brethren in Westfield were not proved, and I replied to him that if he could not recognise that they were proved, it would be impossible to prove anything to him of this character.<a name=63:2></a> Certain brothers in Westfield who had part with him in the wrong-doing, have owned their sin humbly and fully, but he and others with him refused to do so.<a name=63:3></a> ------'s case is pathetic, especially since he is said to be quite ill.<a name=63:4></a> But with the knowledge and experience he has, he could easily have prevented the whole sorrow by insisting that the brethren should abide by right principles at the outset.<a name=63:5></a> I called his attention to the errors made from time to time, both as to the false statements and also as to the interference with ------'s services, but with no final result; for in their long paper issued on the very day on which the discipline was administered, those withdrawn from sought to justify their whole course.<a name=63:6></a>

		For some ten years on various occasions, ------ has been the cause of the deepest concern to me as tending in his doctrines and principles to becloud and divide the saints: first in his view of the departed saints, which came out in Detroit many years ago, entirely unscriptural, and tending to spiritism; then his view that the saints continue to grow after they are translated to heaven, which is also unscriptural; then his views on boundaries governing the meetings of the saints in their relations to one another, also found to be unscriptural; also his serious error at Chicago which almost divided the saints in America; and now this grave matter which has caused his exclusion from fellowship.<a name=63:7></a> It is true that most of these matters are supposed to have been adjusted, but I cannot say that ------ has judged them all as wrong.<a name=63:8></a> I am mentioning them only to show what a course has been pursued and undoubtedly the Lord has had this in mind in allowing our brother to pursue such an unwarranted way in the present matter.<a name=63:9></a> There is much personal sympathy and bias in his favour now, because of his age and bodily condition, but the Lord's rights must come first in every case, while every true Christian will be sympathetic with one in bodily affliction, as I am certainly with ------ now.<a name=63:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My wife and I are sympathetic with you in your feelings as regards what has happened in Westfield, knowing your long friendship with ------ .<a name=66:13></a> Our longer and more direct acquaintance with our brother, occasions a different viewpoint, much more different than you are aware of.<a name=66:14></a> During the past fifteen years or so ------ has occasioned me more genuine concern than any other brother.<a name=66:15></a> One sorrowful circumstance after another, which are now known to many, has occasioned conflict, as one felt before the Lord obliged to have to contend against doctrines and principles that tended to darken and divide the saints.<a name=66:16></a> The principal instances are his teaching many years ago as to the departed saints, which was unscriptural and tended to spiritism; then his view that we continue to grow after receiving our glorified bodies.<a name=66:17></a> Then his widely circulated paper on boundaries governing the meetings of the saints, also shown to be unscriptural; with this was his support of ------ in a movement that also was calculated to divide the saints; then the serious erroneous advice he furnished in Chicago, and now his course which has culminated so disastrously.<a name=66:18></a> After much conflict and heart burning, adjustments were reached as to most of these instances, in no case in an entirely satisfactory sense.<a name=66:19></a> There can be no doubt that all this is in mind in our brother being allowed of the Lord to pursue the refusal of what is right in a partisan way ending in the present sorrow.<a name=66:20></a> ------ is now said to be quite ill and I am

		<a name=67>[Page 67]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		certainly sympathetic with him in his bodily affliction.<a name=67:1></a> In the minds of some, his illness is effecting bias and endangering a clear view of the truth involved.<a name=67:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is quite true, as you say, that the 'crux of things is what has been said or done as against ------'.<a name=67:3></a> This is true.<a name=67:4></a> But the use of the name of a brother in the matter does not affect the truth involved in the course pursued.<a name=67:5></a> The brother could be easily left with the Lord and however much he might suffer from the opposition to him, would be turned to good account in the end.<a name=67:6></a> But in what has transpired the enemy has had a wider thought than to attack one brother, namely to legalise by precedent certain principles and methods that would lower the whole standard amongst us.<a name=67:7></a> Thus whilst the eyes of certain brethren were on this brother, the enemy was diverting them from the truth in the methods they employed against him.<a name=67:8></a> This is what led to the exercise in which, I suppose, I had a leading part.<a name=67:9></a> I conveyed it in letters from England, as the false procedure began in the summer of 1935, and spoke of it to the leading brothers in New York and Westfield, as I returned to New York in August 1935.<a name=67:10></a> I pointed out then the unsupported charges made by the New York brethren and received by the Westfield brethren.<a name=67:11></a> If these charges had been withdrawn then, I should have been more than thankful to leave all else in the Lord's hands, but they were allowed to stand for a whole year.<a name=67:12></a> Nothing whatever was done in either meeting to meet my exercise.<a name=67:13></a> Still I left the matter, placing it in His hands, trusting that the Lord would overrule and indeed bring all the brethren around to the truth.<a name=67:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But after the whole primary matter of the New York letters to Westfield and Knoxville was adjusted and ------ was formally owned all around to be free among the brethren, an effort was made of restriction at Westfield.<a name=67:15></a> This was by a <i>group of brothers</i> who fully admitted to me that ------ had the same status as they had.<a name=67:16></a> Again, perhaps, I took the lead in inquiring from Westfield as to this matter.<a name=67:17></a> There was no question of ------ but of dealing with the condition there which was trenching on the Lord's rights and which if allowed to proceed would establish a precedent in the Lord's service, namely that a group of brothers can legitimately interfere with a brother in his service because of <i>their feeling</i>.<a name=67:18></a> The leading brother with ------ said they expected to be inquired of before ------ should be allowed to preach.<a name=67:19></a> This was occasioned by an invitation

		<a name=68>[Page 68]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		to him to go to Manchester, Connecticut In spite of the truth being brought to bear upon them, this group of brothers continued interference in this way for many months.<a name=68:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The New York letter of withdrawal to Westfield accentuated all this and also the error in Westfield of procedure founded on false information.<a name=68:2></a> Shortly after the withdrawal of the New York letter some brothers in Westfield who had taken strong part in the whole proceedings, owned their error, making a full, open confession with contrition.<a name=68:3></a> This was further testimony to the consciences of the others, but they refused to heed it and disregarded all entreaties to own their part as well and clear the meeting, and they continued, up to the time of withdrawal from them by their brethren at Westfield, in this attitude.<a name=68:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus you will see that nothing was precipitated in the action of withdrawal, but the contrary, for the evil in which these brothers had part began to be laid on their consciences more than a year and a half ago.<a name=68:5></a> In view of all these things the truth is apparent, the brethren in these parts generally recognise it, so that fellowship is extended by the nearby meetings to the brethren continuing on at Westfield.<a name=68:6></a>
	</div>

		Beloved Brother, -- I much appreciated your letter and the copy of what was written to ------ .<a name=68:17></a> It was faithful and should tend to save her from any wrong attitude or movement in this critical time and to enable her to judge as inconsistent with the truth which she professes to hold, her previous action in attending the meeting at Cranford, avoiding that at Westfield, where, for the moment, she was residing.<a name=68:18></a> It is surely of God to safeguard His truth in this way and help a sister at the same time; for neutrality to it, as in the case of Bethesda, as you pointed out to is really opposition to it.<a name=68:19></a>

		I have heard that exception has been taken to the letter written to ------ , copy of which you sent, not because of its contents, but its form as written from the meeting of brothers for care.<a name=69:1></a> I see no just ground for this, for <i>care</i> for a soul -- one of your own number -- was its object.<a name=69:2></a> If ------ was in Highland Park and three of you went to see her the position would be the same.<a name=69:3></a> The letter is merely an expression of care for one of your own -- local -- sisters.<a name=69:4></a> At the outset elders cared for the assembly -- its members -- in this way, and a meeting of brothers -- what we rightly call a care-meeting -- seeks humbly to do this now.<a name=69:5></a> Its action cannot be more than tentative if leading up to formal discipline, but much can be done in love and confidence to help the saints by brothers gathered in this way short of telling it to the assembly, compare <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18">Matthew  18</a>.<a name=69:6></a>

		Beloved Brother, -- I duly received your letter of December 14th, ult.<a name=69:12></a> and read it with interest.<a name=69:13></a> As far as I can gather I am in agreement with your general thought as to service Godward in the assembly.<a name=69:14></a> The danger in this matter, as in others, is to be too rigid and to bring what is entirely spiritual down to the compass of the natural mind.<a name=69:15></a> There is also the danger of dividing service in the assembly too much into sections, as it were.<a name=69:16></a> Whereas there should be full scope for divine activity, bearing on actual conditions existing.<a name=69:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If the state of the brethren is normal, they should proceed at once to the breaking of bread, for that is what they have come together to do.<a name=69:18></a> A song of praise to the Lord at the outset is very appropriate and acceptable to Him.<a name=69:19></a> The Supper in its two parts is required for the full thought of <i>memorial</i>, which was in the Lord's mind in its institution.<a name=69:20></a> And this should lead to the recognition of the Lord in the midst, and His own affections for the assembly, in answer to which He looks for suitable response from those gathered.<a name=69:21></a> There should certainly
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=70>[Page 70]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		be full scope for this, for in the future He presents the assembly to <i>Himself</i> glorious.<a name=70:1></a> In connection with this, there is the thought of His mediatorship and He will bring God in as presented in the cup.<a name=70:2></a> Thus, free and with Him intelligently, He will lead us on to the family and eternal thoughts.<a name=70:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If, however, the state of the meeting is low, the Lord would have, perhaps, to reprove us through a word given.<a name=70:4></a> We see in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24">Luke  24</a>how His presence caused dismay in the meeting, and so He had to adjust the saints.<a name=70:5></a> In principle, there is nothing to hinder a word of ministry at any part of the assembly service; normally it would stimulate, but it requires wisdom on the part of one who ministers so that what he presents would help rather than interfere with the service.<a name=70:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards hymns, I observe that these are now used too sparingly, and many excellent hymns for the assembly are becoming obsolete, brethren fearing to give them out as unsuitable.<a name=70:7></a> The Lord, however, will correct all this in time and make room for the free use of what is provided in our hymnbook for the service of God.<a name=70:8></a> But there are very few hymns which convey the idea of the covenant.<a name=70:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards prayer meetings, the apostolic usage shows that "God", "God and Father" and "Lord Jesus Christ", may be used in addressing divine Persons.<a name=70:10></a> In general, Scripture would encourage our addressing God the Father.<a name=70:11></a> But, of course, it also requires that we should address the Lord Jesus directly.<a name=70:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'The Westfield Case' did not need my remarks as to ------'s extended course to strengthen it -- although the facts stated enter into it morally -- the body of the letter you comment on shows guilt attaching to those withdrawn from that imperatively had to be judged to maintain the holiness of God's house.<a name=80:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You put it to me to say whether ------ is a wicked person.<a name=80:12></a> For eighteen months or more he strenuously refused to judge evil done by him and others in the holy things of God and influenced others to follow his course on definitely partisan lines, and finally refused even to see his brethren, who had made it plain to him that unless he judged and renounced the evil they could not walk with him.<a name=80:13></a> He and another brother, he especially, had led a good few saints as a <i>band</i> into a self-willed course (see <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#15:22">1 Samuel  15:22</a>, 23).<a name=80:14></a> Scripture specially abhors this, as the passage I have mentioned shows -- also <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#16">Numbers  16</a>.<a name=80:15></a> There is no evidence of repentance and hence the name of the whole matter is written on the face of it.<a name=80:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then you speak of <i>looking</i> at the brothers at Westfield to whom I have given my support.<a name=80:17></a> A look from such a distance is very precarious!<a name=80:18></a> It is worse by far in your case, for it leads you to misjudge your brethren and say untrue things about them.<a name=80:19></a> Of ------ you say, 'the cause of all the sorrow' -- a positive untruth.<a name=80:20></a> How do you know he is the cause of all the sorrow?<a name=80:21></a> You do not know it; you just write it, manifestly without any sense of the gravity of making such a charge against a brother without ample proof.<a name=80:22></a> You quote from the New York letter to Westfield of June 20th, 1935, as if this were proof.<a name=80:23></a> You surely must know that this letter was <i>withdrawn</i>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=81>[Page 81]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>by its authors with sorrow</i>.<a name=81:1></a> Even if it had not been withdrawn, what you quote from the New York letter could not prove your charge as righteous, but to endeavour to prove a serious charge -- in this case nothing could be much more serious -- from a letter withdrawn with sorrow, is a procedure that needs no comment; it carries its own condemnation.<a name=81:2></a> If you say you were unaware of the withdrawal, then you show your incompetency to have to say to the matter at all.<a name=81:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the other brothers, your comments are really of no value, for you are not really acquainted with them or their circumstances.<a name=81:4></a> Of one you say 'he has been described to me as uncommonly weak'.<a name=81:5></a> This is simply untrue, for he has shown himself a brother of courage and clear-sightedness.<a name=81:6></a> He manfully renounced the evil he had been linked with as one of the party and has pursued a steady course in support of what is right and true ever since.<a name=81:7></a> The brethren are cheered by him.<a name=81:8></a> You enquire, 'is he not of the same nationality as your son-in-law?<a name=81:9></a>' Why this enquiry if not to insinuate bias?<a name=81:10></a> They <i>are</i> of the same <i>nationality</i> for both were born and brought up in the United States.<a name=81:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then you speak of '------'s little boy, your grandson, aged 14, believe'.<a name=81:12></a> This 'little boy' is, I judge, as tall as you, and is well developed physically, mentally, and spiritually.<a name=81:13></a> He is now in his eighteenth year and takes part acceptably in nearly all meetings he attends.<a name=81:14></a> There is <i>another</i> 'little boy' of ------'s who began to break bread last November, that is, since you were last here, and hence you cannot have him in mind.<a name=81:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Your thought is clearly to discredit the meeting at Westfield, but you omitted to mention two other brothers -- Ewing and Edwin Storr, the latter mature -- he is married and has a child of five-and very promising.<a name=81:16></a> There are 18 in all, including another brother named Mr.<a name=81:17></a> Long, and the Lord manifestly helps them.<a name=81:18></a> You will see thus that your long-distance look at Westfield deceived you.<a name=81:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards ------'s support of ------ , you are basing your remarks on the circular on boundaries, but this was <i>late</i> in the exercise.<a name=81:20></a> ------ said he got the substance of it 'on the Pacific' -- that is, on his way back from Australia.<a name=81:21></a> He had changed his mind and his circular cut across the Forest Hill principles.<a name=81:22></a> But earlier ------ had been with ------ .<a name=81:23></a> I am basing this on what was generally known here, especially by myself, and in South Africa when I was there last year it was stated

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus you will see that I cannot withdraw what I wrote on this point.<a name=82:3></a> But righteousness requires that you should withdraw the letter I am replying to, for it is wrong throughout, both in spirit and contents.<a name=82:4></a>

		That the light of God is still here in the assembly is, of course, true and will remain so until the end.<a name=86:2></a> But silence as to the golden lamps after Ephesus, and a remnant directed to the Lord's coming and the millennial reign, show that the whole outward position is changed, that morally it is judged.<a name=86:3></a> The Lord says "I am about to spue thee out of my mouth", although He is offering counsel and standing at the door knocking.<a name=86:4></a> The spiritually instructed believer knows the position: the assembly remains here and the Spirit; inwardly all is thus secured, but he will not speak of things as if no sorrowful departure has taken place, and so will recognise that the removal of the lamp as the Lord spoke of it must have taken place.<a name=86:5></a> The thought remains and will find expression later, but the assembly viewed in this way has lost its place, although the <i>responsibility</i> of its having had that place still attaches to the public body.<a name=86:6></a>

		Another consideration enters into this, that is, the need of the utmost spirituality possible in those who attend the general meetings -- so that the Holy Spirit should have conditions most calculated for the opening up of the truth.<a name=88:20></a> If the selection is left with the several meetings, the most spiritual may not attend, for they would most likely give voluntary place to others, whereas if these receive personal invitations they would regard themselves as responsible to accept, and be exercised accordingly.<a name=88:21></a> <a href="../bible/Nehemiah.htm#8:13">Nehemiah  8:13</a> - 18 certainly enters into this feature of the position.<a name=88:22></a> Thus it seems that the method which, as I understand, has been followed is the right one -- to take counsel with brothers in each district -- known to be reliable, not one only but two or more as a matter of witness, and then the Birmingham brethren to make the selection and invite.<a name=88:23></a> God will respect and support the pursuit of right principles.<a name=88:24></a>

		My Dear Brother, -- I have received copies of documents -- mostly letters -- signed principally by you, extending back to July, the last being dated October 21st, which came today.<a name=94:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have been deeply concerned by their contents, especially those of the Report of the Assembly decision and the letter to of September 1st enlarging on and justifying it.<a name=94:30></a> In the letter you say the judgment was 'reached in assembly, with the Lord in the midst based upon duly established facts as in the light of Scripture and in accord with the principles that are to control such matters and as led by the Spirit who is holy and who is the Spirit of truth, and we are told that no lie is of the truth.<a name=94:31></a> To this judgment all should bow', etc.<a name=94:32></a>, etc.<a name=94:33></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As matters stood before the judgment was reached 'in assembly' I felt I could leave matters, trusting that the Lord would in time clarify Mr.<a name=94:34></a> H--------'s financial affairs; believing
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=95>[Page 95]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that the brethren in Columbus were sincerely assured that Mr.<a name=95:1></a> H------ was upright in his borrowings which I had no good ground for challenging and certainly had no wish to do so, indeed hoped, as I may say, against hope that this judgment was right, I maintained normal links with Mr.<a name=95:2></a> H------ .<a name=95:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But this 'assembly judgment' committing the Lord, the Holy Spirit and the assembly to unqualified approval of Mr.<a name=95:4></a> H------'s course of borrowings, changes -- for me -- the whole position.<a name=95:5></a> What has caused me anxiety as <i>possibly</i> involving dishonour to the Lord and His testimony has now been solemnly declared to be righteous 'in assembly' professedly with the Lord and the Holy Spirit in the midst.<a name=95:6></a> I might have written you earlier, but hesitated to do so, trusting what others had written might lead to the brethren reconsidering the matter, for, as <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#4">Leviticus  4</a>shows, an assembly <i>may</i> err, and there is provision to adjust this.<a name=95:7></a> But your letter to Mr.<a name=95:8></a> H------ of the 21st inst.<a name=95:9></a> received today shows that you are thoroughly committed to the 'judgment', criticising those who do not accept it in very severe terms -- terms which do not appear to me justifiable.<a name=95:10></a> You cite 'information by one inside' to incriminate Mr.<a name=95:11></a> M------ and his son.<a name=95:12></a> According to Scripture <i>one</i> witness is not enough in such matters.<a name=95:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then Mr.<a name=95:14></a> A------ is said to be in 'evident alliance with them and with other enemies'.<a name=95:15></a> Mr.<a name=95:16></a> A------ and other brethren are thus branded as enemies in a bad sense.<a name=95:17></a> This is not of God surely.<a name=95:18></a> And then Mr.<a name=95:19></a> A------ is spoken of as seeking illegal information.<a name=95:20></a> You do not <i>show</i> that what he did was illegal.<a name=95:21></a> If Mr.<a name=95:22></a> H------ owed Mr.<a name=95:23></a> A------ money the payment of which was <i>long</i> deferred on the ground that a certain asset was not yet turned into cash, it would not be illegal for the latter to make enquiry where he thought he could obtain information as to whether the supposed asset really existed, or was what it was said to be.<a name=95:24></a> Such a firm as Dun's undertakes to supply such information and is regarded as perfectly legal in doing so.<a name=95:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The fact that Mr.<a name=95:26></a> H------ does not owe Mr.<a name=95:27></a> A------ money does not detract from what I write as to this matter.<a name=95:28></a> Mr.<a name=95:29></a> H------ owes money to several in <i>fellowship</i> and some not in fellowship, discrediting the testimony.<a name=95:30></a> This obligates Mr.<a name=95:31></a> A------ and all who are in fellowship, and surely it is not illegal to make 'diligent inquisition' for Scripture enjoins this.<a name=95:32></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards the use of Scripture in the Report, what is quoted bears mainly on the <i>lender</i>, whereas what Scripture enjoins directly or indirectly on the borrower should be also <i>stressed</i>.<a name=96:25></a> For in your deliberations the lenders were not present, the borrower was.<a name=96:26></a> Scripture enjoins that the believer is to owe no one anything except love.<a name=96:27></a> It says Israel should lend and not borrow.<a name=96:28></a> This would mean that as blessed of God they would not need to borrow; but it says that as <i>not</i> blessed (cursed indeed) of Him they would be obliged to borrow (<a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#28:12">Deuteronomy  28:12</a>, 44).<a name=96:29></a> Thus moral degradation attaches to one

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do urge therefore that you all reconsider this whole matter and see if you have not gone too far in your assembly judgment.<a name=97:5></a> Unless this is done brethren elsewhere, having such general facts and exercises based on them as they have, will be obliged to examine into the facts governing each borrowing transaction.<a name=97:6></a> It is certain that the 'judgment' cannot be accepted on its face value.<a name=97:7></a>

		Beloved Brother, -- I am very interested in all you say as to addressing the Father in relation to the new covenant, although I am wondering why it is that you find so many wishing to do so, for it is not my experience.<a name=99:18></a> <i>God</i> has been addressed at the Lord's supper -- at least I do so, and I have heard of others who do it -- but for years I have not heard, that I can recall, of anyone suggesting that the Father should be addressed.<a name=99:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Of course I shall welcome any help.<a name=99:20></a> It seems, however, that departure from what is accepted by the saints as spiritually right should be well supported by Scripture if advocated.<a name=99:21></a> I have been thinking over the subject, since I saw a letter from you to Mr.<a name=99:22></a> Lyon, but I have not reached any change of thought

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The new covenant is, in Scripture, introduced into Christianity in connection with the Lord's supper and approach to God -- <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11">1 Corinthians  11</a>, the synoptic gospels, and Hebrews -- and is linked with the death of Christ rather than with the revelation of the Father.<a name=100:2></a> The Lord would, I suppose, give thanks to the Father in the institution of the Supper, but, as in relation to the assembly, the memorial is called "the Lord's supper", not the Father's; thus we rightly give thanks to the Lord for the bread and cup.<a name=100:3></a> To be safe as to anything we should move in the teaching of the apostles, <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:42">Acts  2:42</a>, and especially that of Paul.<a name=100:4></a> The teaching as to the Father in the gospels should be reached in this way.<a name=100:5></a> In the gospels the Father comes in in relation to <i>Christ</i>, owning Him, not in relation to the blood of the covenant.<a name=100:6></a> The Lord linked the disciples with Himself in relation to the Father, as in the synoptic gospels, evidently on lower ground than is proper to the assembly.<a name=100:7></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>gives the latter.<a name=100:8></a> Ephesians speaks of access to the Father through Christ by the Spirit, whereas access in Hebrews is through the death of Christ, the great Priest over the house of God, etc.<a name=100:9></a> -- clearly to <i>God;</i> the Father is not mentioned in that epistle as to us save as "Father of spirits".<a name=100:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul clearly connects the Lord's supper with the assembly, and as the disciples -- he with them -- assembled to break bread.<a name=100:11></a> Obviously it took the first place in the service -- the apostle's address, etc.<a name=100:12></a> in Troas would be special -- and as it was the Lord's supper, He would have the dominant place in it.<a name=100:13></a> He would be 'everything' initially, but the "sanctuary" would be there and He as "Minister" of it would lead to God.<a name=100:14></a> This is how the truth of assembly service should be laid hold of, I am assured.<a name=100:15></a>

		The statement which you quote, that it is 'quite erroneous to think that the Lord would lead the saints to the Father, that it was not His intention to do so' is certainly not in keeping with Scripture.<a name=102:1></a> As answered from the horns of the buffaloes (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>), He declares the Father's name and praises Him in the midst of the assembly.<a name=102:2></a> To do all this was evidently uppermost in His mind.<a name=102:3></a> Moreover, He says, the Father <i>seeks</i> true worshippers, and surely He would normally have before Him to gratify this work.<a name=102:4></a> It was, no doubt, part of the "joy that was set before Him".<a name=102:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To say, as you quote, 'that it is quite a mistake to expect the Lord to lead us off covenant ground every time, providing we were up to it' that is, as I read, that He would not always, as opportunity offered, lead on to the <i>full</i> service of God.<a name=102:6></a> This, I am sure, is unscriptural .<a name=102:7></a>.<a name=102:8></a>.<a name=102:9></a> and reflects on the ministry of Christ in the sanctuary.<a name=102:10></a> <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#8">Hebrews  8</a>to 10: 22 shows that the covenant is to set us free to draw near to God.<a name=102:11></a> Why should this thought of drawing near -- the urgency of it -- be weakened in the minds of the saints?<a name=102:12></a> What can be meant in the movement to the Mount of Olives after the Supper and the hymn, save that <i>normally</i> there is something beyond 'covenant ground' in assembly service?<a name=102:13></a>

		As regards leadership in special readings, we are to <i>know</i> those who labour among us and take the lead among us in the Lord, <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#5:12">1 Thessalonians  5:12</a>.<a name=103:1></a> Then, God has set certain gifts in the assembly and these are to be recognised.<a name=103:2></a> Thus in such a meeting as you mentioned the brethren should be able to determine who has the greatest ability among those present and make room for him.<a name=103:3></a> This is but recognising God's provision and ordering.<a name=103:4></a> Of course, courtesy, or rather brotherly consideration, enters into such a position and hence brothers from distant parts should have special room made for them.<a name=103:5></a> Love never fails in these matters and the Lord is with us in the arrangements we make as governed by it.<a name=103:6></a> Any special local need existing could be mentioned, but the subject or scripture should be left with the brother who takes the lead.<a name=103:7></a> The assembly does not teach or preach.<a name=103:8></a> In Scripture, ministry is made dependent on gift.<a name=103:9></a> Peter stood up with the eleven, <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>.<a name=103:10></a> Inviting a brother, whether local or resident elsewhere, to take the lead in special meetings is right.<a name=103:11></a> It is taking advantage of God's provision.<a name=103:12></a> The Macedonian man said, Come over to Macedonia and help us.<a name=103:13></a>

		As to one ceasing to break bread or withdrawing from a meeting -- if no specific evil is evident the exercise of discipline hardly fits.<a name=103:14></a> We have to humbly accept the loss and if there is a likelihood of some in the meeting not knowing of the withdrawal the fact should be mentioned with humble acknowledgement.<a name=103:15></a> Each case should be treated according to existent facts, some calling for compassion; others marked by a degree of worldliness.<a name=103:16></a> Whatever is known in this respect should be mentioned that it should be on record that the assembly has a judgment as to them.<a name=103:17></a> "Your judgment", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#18:20">Revelation  18:20</a>, is respected in heaven.<a name=103:18></a> There is surely some moral defect in one who deliberately leaves the place of light and privilege.<a name=103:19></a> The judgment formed by the saints as to one who has withdrawn stands against him and determines his status as to the fellowship, and he will have to face this sooner or later, either as seeking to resume his place or as at the judgment seat of Christ.<a name=103:20></a> Individual relations with him by those in fellowship must recognise this judgment.<a name=103:21></a>

		One thing is clear -- that order should mark all that is done in the assembly, but at the same time, simplicity, "simplicity as to the Christ".<a name=104:14></a> Thus, as to persons seeking to walk with us, <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:14">Revelation  22:14</a> shows that those who "wash their robes" have a "right", that they should go in by the gates into the city.<a name=104:15></a> Clear testimony that one does wash his robes is thus all that is needed.<a name=104:16></a> The apostles and elders came together "to see about this matter" -- the principle of a care meeting.<a name=104:17></a> What was reached by enquiry and scriptural principles went forward, as it were, to the assembly -- due allowance being made for the apostles having led in the matter -- so that "it seemed good to the apostles and to the elders with the whole assembly", etc.<a name=104:18></a> From the above it is clear to me that testimony as to a believer seeking part in the fellowship coming through the care meeting in a normal way should be accepted by the assembly, most of which, or at least those who take the lead in it, having had part in the investigation.<a name=104:19></a> Cumbersomeness should be avoided, and the confidence of love requires that brethren solemnly meeting in care of the assembly should be trusted.<a name=104:20></a> I do not, therefore, see the need of the brothers who have visited the person seeking to have part in the fellowship, testifying to the assembly after testifying to the brothers met in care.<a name=104:21></a> The name of the person being announced on a Lord's Day morning to break bread on the following, no objection being made in the interim, amply safeguards the matter.<a name=104:22></a>

		The use of the name Father may be wide according to the teaching and example of Scripture, as you say, but John's gospel ought to be especially in mind in relation to formal assembly service.<a name=107:6></a> Assembly service toward God obviously flows out of the saints coming together "in assembly".<a name=107:7></a> Here the Lord's supper is <i>immediately</i> in view, and it is the Lord's -- not God's nor the Father's supper.<a name=107:8></a> We have the Lord's supper, the Lord's table, the Lord's cup, the Lord's body, etc.<a name=107:9></a> It is thus, it seems to me, a dominical matter, the paternal side of the service coming later.<a name=107:10></a> This is not the <i>general</i> use of "Father" seen in the synoptic gospels applied even to the Jewish remnant, but what properly belongs to the <i>heavenly</i> family.<a name=107:11></a> John brings us into the <i>use</i> of it only in this sense.<a name=107:12></a> To bring it into the service of the assembly in the dominical feature of it is not therefore according to Scripture or spiritual intelligence.<a name=107:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mr.<a name=111:31></a> Hayward wrote me some time ago as to Kaiwaka and I felt I could say but little as my knowledge of the facts and persons involved were so scanty.<a name=111:32></a> But I did say that I did not think the meeting in Kaiwaka should be dissolved because of Mr.<a name=111:33></a> S------'s wicked conduct.<a name=111:34></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Whether assembly conditions did not exist could hardly be determined save as by a visit to the place.<a name=111:35></a> Thus A.<a name=111:36></a>M.<a name=111:37></a>H.<a name=111:38></a> was in a position to judge as to actual conditions, having been on
	</div>

		<a name=112>[Page 112]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the spot and I was not.<a name=112:1></a> But as to the truth governing the position, the prevalence of natural relationship could not, in itself, be a reason for discontinuing the meeting, nor, as I said, could S------'s conduct, in itself, be a valid reason for the dissolution of the meeting.<a name=112:2></a> As to the first, Scripture shows that any disadvantage occasioned in a meeting of saints by natural relationship may be overcome by spiritual power: the Levite says to his father and mother, "I have not seen him".<a name=112:3></a> Then S------'s conduct is of the devil and in such cases as the saints look to Him, God would come in and give deliverance.<a name=112:4></a> A wicked man similarly attacked the saints in Kingston, Jamaica, and harassed the saints for years, but God evidently has come in for deliverance as I saw there lately.<a name=112:5></a> That Kaiwaka brethren sinned against light furnished them would, it seems to me, be difficult to prove.<a name=112:6></a> Brethren elsewhere judging on this line can hardly hope that this judgment will satisfy the consciences of others.<a name=112:7></a> In such matters <i>facts</i> must be considered if a righteous judgment is to be reached.<a name=112:8></a> Judgments based on impressions, feelings, etc.<a name=112:9></a> are usually the cause of the continuance of those local sorrows, that are now, alas!<a name=112:10></a> so prevalent.<a name=112:11></a> If in our enquiries we confine ourselves to the facts of a case and the principles that govern it we shall rule out all that is extraneous, thus reducing it to its own limits for judicial purposes, making, under God, a right judgment certain.<a name=112:12></a> The Lord is jealous as to His rights in localities, and thus a doubtful position should be left immediately in His hands.<a name=112:13></a> If it is clear -- the priests being responsible, especially those nearby -- that the meeting is leprous, this being established by known facts, of course fellowship should be discontinued.<a name=112:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus I would say that if active self-will cannot be shown to be working among the saints at Kaiwaka, and that they are in the main seeking to be in the place for the Lord, other meetings should stand by them in sympathy and prayer, individuals visiting them for instruction, comfort and support.<a name=112:15></a> To make them transgressors for not acting on advice given by a brother is most precarious -- indeed wrong and tending to becloud the position.<a name=112:16></a> It is but on individual belief or impression and not valid as evidence in a judicial enquiry.<a name=112:17></a> Another thing is, that impressions as to causes and results should not govern us in judicial administration in the house of God.<a name=112:18></a> These have to be left with God.<a name=112:19></a> We must, as already said, go by the facts and principles governing any case, and the Lord will not fail

		As regards the other case you mention, it seems to me, judging by the facts you furnish, that the sister in question should be treated as a subject of compassion, being evidently a sufferer from mental derangement.<a name=113:2></a> I have had much to do with persons thus affected -- the affliction showing itself after they took part in the fellowship.<a name=113:3></a> If they quietly submit to a judgment reached in assembly we should be thankful.<a name=113:4></a> That their natural relatives should care for them is surely right, and their presence in a house, as subject to the order of it, cannot be regarded as a defilement.<a name=113:5></a> Unless there is very good reason that is based on facts to question such a circumstance, it should be left with the meeting in which it exists.<a name=113:6></a> Wisdom would lead us to confine evil or trouble, to leave it as much as possible in the hands of those immediately responsible.<a name=113:7></a>

		As regards the beginning in John, I have understood it as generally the same as in Genesis 1, but the absence of the article in the former verse 1 makes it characteristic, I suppose, and less definite.<a name=114:18></a> "<i>He</i> was in the beginning with God", verse 2 is, however, definite, linking with the creation.<a name=114:19></a> It has been remarked, I think, that it is the beginning of all that had a beginning.<a name=114:20></a> This, I am sure, is true.<a name=114:21></a> Genesis 1 connects the mind with material things and it is likely angels were before the heavens and the earth; <a href="../bible/Job.htm#38:7">Job  38:7</a>.<a name=114:22></a>

		Beloved Brother, -- Last week I received from A.<a name=116:14></a>M.<a name=116:15></a>H.<a name=116:16></a> notes of a reading with you at Brackley on September 22nd on <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1">1 Peter  1</a>and 2, also a reading at Marlborough on October 24th on some chapters in Luke.<a name=116:17></a> As I do not think the tenor of them -- especially the first -- agrees with what you and the brethren generally have been for many years pursuing as truth, I send you a line, this being the more necessary as the notes are said to be unrevised.<a name=116:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The word "covenant" is used generally in the notes, not new covenant, but evidently the latter is in mind, although Peter never uses the latter term.<a name=116:19></a> The notes stress that the covenant was made for the land, not for the wilderness, although made in the wilderness.<a name=116:20></a> As you obviously have the antitype in view, I wonder at this, for as to Christians the wilderness continues while we are down here -- indeed during the whole period of Christ's absence -- and the new covenant stands connected with it.<a name=116:21></a> It is found in 1 and 2 Corinthians and Hebrews.<a name=116:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The notes further say, that the first provisions of the covenant required the land.<a name=116:23></a> This is stranger still, for the ten words require <i>love</i>, as the Lord shows in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#22">Matthew  22</a>, and this surely is begotten in the wilderness, as Romans teaches.<a name=116:24></a> It is in the land, too, of course, but Romans and 1 and 2 Corinthians regard love as in the saints and these epistles do not contemplate us as risen with Christ.<a name=116:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With the above is associated in the notes the thought that entrance into the inheritance, or the land, is necessary so that the people should have the means of offering.<a name=116:26></a> Of course certain offerings required the land, but Scripture shows that offerings were required of the people in the wilderness and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=117>[Page 117]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that they could supply them too.<a name=117:1></a> I need not tell you how Moses contended with Pharaoh that Israel must have their flocks and herds so that they could offer to Jehovah, serve Him with them.<a name=117:2></a> And then Jehovah had said to Abram that they should go out of Egypt with "great property".<a name=117:3></a> This fact is amply attested by the material for the tabernacle which they supplied.<a name=117:4></a> This is also seen in Christians -- the immediate outcome of the reception of the gospel, as taught in Romans.<a name=117:5></a> (I challenge myself as to why I am saying these things to <i>you</i>!<a name=117:6></a>).<a name=117:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing enlarged on in the notes that seems to me should be reconsidered is the thought that Christ personally is in view in the covenant -- based on the fact that the Hebrew bondman is mentioned in the sprinkled book.<a name=117:8></a> But other persons and things are mentioned in that book that cannot be included in the <i>New</i> Covenant, and of course it is it we have in mind, for the old does not exist save as a type, and the <i>terms</i> of the new show that its scope is not as extensive as the old.<a name=117:9></a> Thus, to use the old, in the light Of <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:15">2 Timothy  2:15</a>, to help as to the new, we must <i>begin</i> with the latter, and not introduce what does not belong to it.<a name=117:10></a> The old covenant, speaking generally, covered the whole Mosaic system, but we cannot say that the new covers the whole Christian dispensation.<a name=117:11></a> In the Lord's supper it is formally connected with the cup by the Lord and I am unable to see that we should extend it to the loaf.<a name=117:12></a> It does not seem cutting in a straight line the word of truth.<a name=117:13></a> As I said, many other things, also persons, are in the book that cannot be included in the new covenant -- such as the angel, who would not forgive Israel's transgressions, and Israel's obedience expressed in their works.<a name=117:14></a> The new is what <i>God</i> does; objectively as in the Lord's supper, it is the testimony of His love to His people.<a name=117:15></a> While the whole <i>public</i> position of Israel, as also of our dispensation, is marked by sacrificial death (blood), detailed instruction provides for the death of Christ -- that He was immune from death.<a name=117:16></a> Thus Aaron, who, as a type, is the bondman, in another light, was by himself anointed <i>without</i> blood; and the love of the bondman for his master is plainly declared without death.<a name=117:17></a> It was not demanded, but spontaneously expressed, also that for his wife and children, in known relationships; all this points to Christ seen in the gospels.<a name=117:18></a> That Christ is said to be a covenant and that He entered the holiest by His own blood is, of course, true, but to say that His body is included in the new covenant as sprinkled
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=118>[Page 118]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		with the blood of it seems to me forced.<a name=118:1></a> It seems to me the Lord's supper should stand before us as combining two great ideas: the first presenting Himself in relation to the assembly; the second bringing God in.<a name=118:2></a> This involves discrimination and distinction in the holy things, which is priestly -- governing the whole service of God.<a name=118:3></a> It is <i>Leviticus</i>, where everything is governed by law or principle, each item having its own value, place and time.<a name=118:4></a> This divine ordering or discrimination would not bring the Father into the <i>Lord's</i> supper.<a name=118:5></a> That blessed relation was not primarily entered into as a matter of authority or through death, but as of counsel -- as Christ is seen in manhood -- the beloved Son in whom the Father found His delight.<a name=118:6></a> The service of God as in Leviticus, David and culminating in Christ through Paul is restrictive -- governed by law, so to speak, so that the worshippers understand what is suitable.<a name=118:7></a> 1 Corinthians leads in this.<a name=118:8></a>

		I hoped to make this letter shorter, but there is much to speak of and I trust it will not weary you.<a name=118:9></a> We are praying much for you and hope your health is fair through mercy.<a name=118:10></a> The season in Jamaica was fruitful, thank God, and there is a remarkable interest in these parts and America generally.<a name=118:11></a> We had an extraordinary meeting here last night; a so-called 'ministry meeting' at which P.<a name=118:12></a>L.<a name=118:13></a> and two other brothers spoke.<a name=118:14></a> There were confessions afterward by six brothers who had sinned in their part in the Westfield-New York matter in 1935.<a name=118:15></a> The grace of the Lord was upon us.<a name=118:16></a>

		As to your enquiries I would say that "Christian" is a name given to believers -- <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#11:26">Acts  11:26</a> -- or disciples.<a name=123:11></a> Of course, one may believe, as we learn in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#19">Acts  19</a>, before he received the Spirit, but generally or normally the terms believer, disciple and Christian are interchangeable.<a name=123:12></a> In saying 'normally' I refer to persons who characteristically are possessed of what is presented to faith in the gospel.<a name=123:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The general truth governing the possession of the Spirit is in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#5:32">Acts  5:32</a> -- God gives Him to them that <i>obey</i> Him.<a name=123:14></a> But there are details of instructions that must be observed: there must be faith as to what the gospel presents, for it is said in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:13">Ephesians  1:13</a>, "having believed, ye have been sealed with the Holy Spirit".<a name=123:15></a> There, God <i>gives</i> the Spirit and obviously we must not assume that He <i>must</i> act automatically and give the Spirit <i>instantly</i> as one believed.<a name=123:16></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#8">Acts  8</a>shows that He does not.<a name=123:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#5:32">Acts  5:32</a> shows that generally true believers receive the Spirit and hence we should not conclude that God would allow one to die without receiving Him.<a name=123:18></a> There is much in this respect that we have to leave with Him.<a name=123:19></a> We can speak confidently as we have Scripture.<a name=123:20></a> There is enough to support our faith, and if anything is withheld we must bow to the wisdom of God.<a name=123:21></a> He is not obliged to give account on <i>all</i> matters.<a name=123:22></a>

		As to giving out a hymn or a prayer in a ministry meeting, Scripture does not indicate that all that follows should be the filling out of it.<a name=123:23></a> The action of the Spirit in the assembly involves variety.<a name=123:24></a> A revelation in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14:30">1 Corinthians  14:30</a> hardly indicates

		Regarding <a href="../bible/John.htm#5:22">John  5:22</a> the <i>Person</i> in the Deity is meant -- He, the Father, does not judge; it is the Son, but nevertheless it is God who judges, for the Son is God.<a name=124:2></a> That is, each of the Divine Persons may act as God.<a name=124:3></a> But where formal distinction is made in Scripture we must recognise it.<a name=124:4></a> Thus the term "God" is wider than Father.<a name=124:5></a> When Judgment, Creation, etc.<a name=124:6></a>, are in question the Son is the actual Person of the Trinity who operates; but still it is the one God.<a name=124:7></a> We may worship God as including all the Persons, but specifically the one God is the Father; <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#8:6">1 Corinthians  8:6</a>.<a name=124:8></a> This is in the economy of grace: the Son and the Spirit act mediatorially.<a name=124:9></a> In judgment the Son will act, but it will be God judging.<a name=124:10></a>

		The real difficulty that has arisen as to meetings for children is that in segregating those belonging to the saints for spiritual teaching they are deprived of the influence and example obtainable in the ordinary meetings of the saints.<a name=129:4></a> The general principle and example afforded in Scripture is that children should learn with their parents.<a name=129:5></a> Children's meetings or 'Sunday-schools' are an outgrowth of current worldly religion and are damaging.<a name=129:6></a>

		A brother wrote me last spring as to meetings for 'outside' children and I told him I had no difficulty, but I found afterwards that what was actually conducted was a system of teaching like a Sunday-school.<a name=129:7></a> In such a case there will be certain results, but the method used is Philistine -- like the "cart" on which the Ark was placed.<a name=129:8></a>

		Beloved Brother, -- Thanks for sending me your thoughts as to the half-tribe of Manasseh.<a name=139:12></a> They are new to me, but I am glad to have them.<a name=139:13></a> There is always instruction in following up a scriptural subject in detail; you have done this as to Manasseh.<a name=139:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is right to note that Manasseh is not mentioned in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#32">Numbers  32</a>as occasioning Moses' displeasure, but this may be because the others <i>led;</i> at any rate, they, the half tribe, cannot be absolved from the blame for they had <i>part</i> in the course condemned.<a name=139:15></a> <i>Morally</i> the reproof included them.<a name=139:16></a> This is unquestionable as their position is viewed <i>antitypically</i>.<a name=139:17></a> All three groups were falling short of the full purpose of God.<a name=139:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The half tribe of Manasseh is almost constantly identified with Reuben and Gad as remaining on the wilderness side of Jordan, all representing Christians who do not value the heavenly position, not entering into it, and share the consequences together (see <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#5:18">1 Chronicles  5:18</a> - 26).<a name=139:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The exercises of the daughters of Zelophehad entered into the position of the half tribe in Canaan, where these women evidently had their inheritance.<a name=139:20></a> <a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#17:1">Joshua  17:1</a> - 6 indicates this.<a name=139:21></a> This passage treats of the inheritance given by Joshua; that given by Moses is referred to subordinately.<a name=139:22></a> <a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#13:31">Joshua  13:31</a> speaks of "one half of the children of Machir" possessing on the wilderness side of Jordan.<a name=139:23></a> Zelophehad's daughters evidently belonged to the other half.<a name=139:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Being of Joseph, the half tribe in Bashan would have a certain advantage over Reuben and Gad, and their acquirement of wealth while in Canaan may be accounted for in this way.<a name=139:25></a> Joshua, himself of Joseph, noted their wealth, but urged them to divide it with their brethren, as if they were apt to be selfish.<a name=139:26></a> And it is said, he "blessed them <i>also</i>", as coming after in importance the two tribes.<a name=139:27></a> The latter had the leading place,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=140>[Page 140]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and in blessing them Joshua recognises this, placing the responsibility attaching to the whole nation upon them.<a name=140:1></a> <a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#22:25">Joshua  22:25</a>, mentioning only Reuben and Gad, confirms this -- that they represented the general position.<a name=140:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It seems to me that a special reproach attached to the half tribe of Manasseh which remained on the eastern side of Jordan, seeing there had been much exercise <i>in the tribe</i> as to the inheritance and the other half went into Canaan.<a name=140:3></a> Those who <i>talk</i> much of our heavenly portion and fail to join with those who enter it are peculiarly wanting.<a name=140:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the Readings at Toronto, I have heard but little in detail save as to what was said about persons withdrawn from.<a name=140:5></a> Those in Ontario whose judgment is of a special value say it tended to weaken what is of God, as reached through recent exercise and conflict.<a name=140:6></a> Those who had taken a lower or negative line expressed themselves as confirmed.<a name=140:7></a>

		Dear Brother, -- I thank you for sending the correct information as to our Lord's sonship in the 'Collected Writings'.<a name=140:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I did not doubt what you wrote, for I was well aware that Mr.<a name=140:13></a> Darby, especially in his early days, had strongly held 'eternal sonship'.<a name=140:14></a> The remarks in Doctrinal, Volume 1 are dated 1831.<a name=140:15></a> Those in Expository, Volume 4 were, of course, much later.<a name=140:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in 1881, he wrote (Letters, Volume 3, page 468) as to <a href="../bible/John.htm#10:36">John  10:36</a> -- that this passage referred to Him as Man.<a name=140:17></a> This is referred to in Notes called 'The Glory of the Son of God', 1932.<a name=140:18></a> Those Notes show that the thought of Christ sent from <i>heaven</i> -- i.<a name=140:19></a>e.<a name=140:20></a>, <i>before</i> incarnation -- is not supported by Scripture.<a name=140:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Your present letter indicates that you are now resting on Mr.<a name=140:22></a> Darby's view of the subject in question, which will not suffice when you are called upon to answer to the Lord as to what you hold, and this, I need not say, is to be looked forward to.<a name=140:23></a> The Lord has been helping His people as to this subject

		for many years, the scriptures bearing on it having been inquired into by godly brethren from all parts with the deepest interest and concern, in which the Holy Spirit was fully owned and sought, and the result of all this inquiry is in print.<a name=141:1></a> You can see it any time -- you have seen it in part, I gather -- and if you refuse it, as you do you are obligated before God to advance something more than an appeal to the writings of Mr.<a name=141:2></a> Darby: you must appeal to the scriptures, as the Lord Himself did.<a name=141:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In your first letter to me, you spoke highly of Mr.<a name=141:4></a> Raven and quoted him as saying he would not remain in fellowship with one who did not hold eternal sonship; but you surely know that F.<a name=141:5></a>E.<a name=141:6></a>R.<a name=141:7></a> rejected it himself a few years later.<a name=141:8></a> Many, with myself, are witnesses to this (see his published letters, page 45).<a name=141:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And in J.<a name=141:10></a>N.<a name=141:11></a>D.<a name=141:12></a>'s writings, there are modifications in the later ones of what earlier works contain.<a name=141:13></a> This is inevitable in all ministry -- save what is 'inspired of God'.<a name=141:14></a> No one would insist on it more than Mr.<a name=141:15></a> Darby himself, as is well known.<a name=141:16></a> There is nothing unseemly or out of accord with the truth to suggest that the Lord may have allowed Mr.<a name=141:17></a> Darby to cling to the generally held view, eternal sonship, considering that at a later period in the testimony more would be gained by calling attention to the truth of Scripture as to it.<a name=141:18></a> The letter to which I have referred and some remarks in Notes and Comments, Volume 7, page 7, show that while J.<a name=141:19></a>N.<a name=141:20></a>D.<a name=141:21></a> did not give up the doctrine of eternal sonship -- which implies what the Creed states, that our Lord was 'begotten of the Father before all worlds' -- his mind as to it was somewhat modified.<a name=141:22></a> Were it the will of God that Mr.<a name=141:23></a> Darby should remain here in service till now, his mind, I am certain, would be much clearer as to eternal life, the Lord's supper, the service of God, the sonship of Christ, and many other subjects than his writings disclose.<a name=141:24></a>

		The special meetings at Council Bluffs this year were distinctly supported by the Lord.<a name=143:1></a> We considered at the Readings 'the marks of identification of assembly material', suggested by such enquiries as, "Who are they", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#7:13">Revelation  7:13</a>, and "Who is this", <a href="../bible/SongofSongs.htm#3:6">Song of Songs  3:6</a>.<a name=143:2></a> We looked at these scriptures, also <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#42">Genesis  42</a>- 48 as to brethren and sons, and <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3:3">Philippians  3:3</a>, <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>and <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#11">Revelation  11</a>as to worshippers.<a name=143:3></a> The addresses -- by Samuels, McCallum and myself -- were blessed too.<a name=143:4></a> Attendance was good relatively and many young ones.<a name=143:5></a> Some eight got special help and signified their wish to break bread.<a name=143:6></a> There was also blessing in large meetings held in this district -- Plainfield and Cranford.<a name=143:7></a> During Christmas and New Year holidays I hope to be at Chicago, Hamilton, Ontario, and a few other places.<a name=143:8></a>

		What you wrote as to the other sorrow -- so very different -- enabled me to see the position quite clearly.<a name=146:20></a> The sin exposed had the character of the betrayal of a trust in addition to the common stamp on it -- that of moral uncleanness -- for Mr.<a name=146:21></a> H------ had a leading position among the saints, making the offence more serious.<a name=146:22></a>

		My Dear Brother, -- Pardon delay in acknowledging your letter.<a name=152:19></a> It is very interesting, but my hands have been very full and the matter involved required close attention; only today have I been able to look at the New York Readings on the 'Sufferings of Christ'.<a name=152:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having looked through the second reading I see nothing in it to justify the claim that it teaches that the "cup" in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22:42">Luke  22:42</a> is less than the cup in the corresponding passages in Matthew and Mark -- the same cup is referred to in each and involves all the sufferings of the cross -- those needed for atonement.<a name=152:21></a> I never had any other or different thought and never intended to convey any other.<a name=152:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was the cup of God's will involving His judgment of human guilt and no other cup could occasion such profound concern to our Saviour as is described in Luke.<a name=152:23></a> The fact that the forsaking, recorded by Matthew and Mark, does not appear in Luke, by no means implies that it was not in the cup as the <i>Lord</i> viewed it.<a name=152:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What was said in the readings as to the Lord's sufferings being less severe in Luke's record and John's is based, of course, on the forsaking being omitted in these gospels; this is only to show how <i>teaching may be limited for certain reasons</i> --
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=153>[Page 153]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		not at all to deny or ignore what is elsewhere added.<a name=153:1></a> As to the cup in Luke, the facts given do not show that the full atoning sufferings of Christ were not in it.<a name=153:2></a> The variation from Matthew and Mark is, I believe, to bring out more distinctly the <i>human</i> side.<a name=153:3></a> <i>Physical</i> suffering is noted and succour by an angel, also that He was withdrawn from the disciples a stone's throw, instead of "going forward a little" -- the former more isolated dependence.<a name=153:4></a> Sonship is in more evidence in Mark -- Abba, Father -- and also in Matthew somewhat.<a name=153:5></a> But in each account the Lord's profound exercises are occasioned by the full sufferings of His atoning work being in prospect, not only what man would cause.<a name=153:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to "withdrawn" in Luke, the <i>fact</i> of it is the point -- not the means by which it came about.<a name=153:7></a> "Going forward" suggests power -- leadership too perhaps -- in meeting Satan, for the conflict here is in relation to the enemy.<a name=153:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To say that 'the angel could not strengthen the Lord in view of atoning sufferings' has no force -- there were no atoning sufferings on the Mount of Olives.<a name=153:9></a> The angel strengthens the Lord in His <i>then</i> present conflict.<a name=153:10></a> That '"the drops of blood" were to arouse our sympathy in anticipation of the sufferings at the hand of man, and that we could not have sympathy with His anticipation of atoning sufferings' is quite an erroneous statement, I am certain.<a name=153:11></a> He was in Gethsemane in unclouded communion with His Father and had His infinite sympathy in His exercises there.<a name=153:12></a>

		Still there is a voice for me -- the evil being in those so near naturally and I am discerning "a thorn in the flesh" and hence seeking to be governed accordingly.<a name=165:3></a> The pressure of war conditions with this personal sorrow, also in the assembly, form a combination peculiarly felt.<a name=165:4></a> But the Lord is saying, "My grace suffices thee".<a name=165:5></a>

		Dear Brother, -- I am thankful for the enquiry as to the man of sin in ------'s communication, also for C.<a name=167:4></a>A.<a name=167:5></a>C.<a name=167:6></a>'s letter regarding it.<a name=167:7></a>

		The latter says, 'It is evident that the two are morally identified'.<a name=167:8></a> This is the ground taken in the readings in question: that is, "the man of sin", as described in <a href="../bible/2Thessalonians.htm#2">2 Thessalonians  2</a>, is referred to as somewhat covering <i>both</i> beasts.<a name=167:9></a> The man of sin according to the description in <a href="../bible/2Thessalonians.htm#2:4">2 Thessalonians  2:4</a> embraces <i>more</i> than is stated of the second beast in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#13">Revelation  13</a>.<a name=167:10></a> He "opposes and exalts himself on high against all called God, or object of veneration; so that he himself sits down in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God".<a name=167:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second beast in a general way, is engaged with making the first beast all this.<a name=167:12></a> He exercises all the authority of the first beast before it, and causes the earth and those who dwell in it to do homage to the first beast.<a name=167:13></a> The first beast is more anti-<i>God</i> than anti-<i>Christ</i>, and this marks the man of sin as seen in <a href="../bible/2Thessalonians.htm#2">2 Thessalonians  2</a>.<a name=167:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The idea of beast in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#13">Revelation  13</a>includes a system or empire, and no doubt the second beast -- comparing what is said of him in Daniel etc.<a name=167:15></a> -- is the head of a kingdom in the east, subordinate to the emperor of the west, but each system is clearly identified with its <i>head</i> -- -both <i>men</i>, as Revelation clearly shows, for both are cast into the lake of fire.<a name=167:16></a> The first beast is clearly the revived Roman Empire, but still he opens his mouth in blasphemies against <i>God</i> -- in keeping with what is said of the man of sin in <a href="../bible/2Thessalonians.htm#2">2 Thessalonians  2</a>.<a name=167:17></a> He is said to be the object of worship before the second beast is introduced, and then the latter is seen as operating to bring all to worship the first beast, not himself.<a name=167:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The person described in 2 Thessalonians is <i>the</i> man of sin, <i>the</i> son of perdition, <i>the</i> lawless one: he exalts <i>himself</i>.<a name=167:19></a> There is no suggestion of one greater.<a name=167:20></a> Thus if this is seen in the second beast, the first beast must be <i>included</i>.<a name=167:21></a> This is intelligible on the principle of the trinity of evil persons, which <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#13">Revelation  13</a>presents.<a name=167:22></a> Hence if in the Divine economy the Son is said to be the true God, the Father cannot be excluded.<a name=167:23></a>

		Beloved Brother, -- Thanks for all information sent me as to conscientious objectors.<a name=168:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this enquiry the word 'conscience', as governed by the word of God, has two bearings: first, it urges respect for and subjection to the Civil Authorities as ordained of God; secondly, it is concerned in the believer that his associations and conduct should acknowledge in the fullest way the rights of God.<a name=168:7></a> No.<a name=168:8></a> 2 is, of course, the first in order in a believer, but I place No.<a name=168:9></a> 1 where it is because the claim of the government is the occasion of the enquiry.<a name=168:10></a> Hence the matter has to be faced from this point of view.<a name=168:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#13">Romans  13</a>stresses subjection to the authorities.<a name=168:12></a> It is not simply every <i>one</i>, but every <i>soul</i>, indicating that the believer's feelings are in it, which is confirmed by the note to verse 1 -- 'let every soul subject itself'.<a name=168:13></a> Further, "there is no authority except from God, and those that exist are set up of God" -- this occasions the feeling attitude of the believer.<a name=168:14></a> The whole passage is striking in this respect.<a name=168:15></a> And what is enjoined is said to be "not only on account of wrath, but also on account of conscience".<a name=168:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How then is the believer to regard the requirement of the government?<a name=168:17></a> Obviously sympathetically.<a name=168:18></a> This certainly should be so in the abstract, and if it touches him seriously he should seek grace from God to be right in his soul as to it, looking to Him to make a way for him: that, on the one hand, he may take up an attitude in having to say to the authorities that will be a testimony to Christ, and, on the other, that he may be maintained from damage in any service allotted to him.<a name=168:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If his conscience thus renders him favourable to the government, will it be unfair in discriminating against any duties required of him by the authorities?<a name=168:20></a> He cannot take life, but can he <i>save</i> life?<a name=168:21></a> And can he not perform many services for the government that <i>in themselves</i> he would gladly take on if he needed work to obtain a living?<a name=168:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Much, of course, may be said as to being clear of army associations, uniforms, etc.<a name=168:23></a>, but the basic facts are that the government urgently needs workers in the fulfilment of duties put on them by God and why should a Christian seek exemption
	</div>

		from services which in themselves are such as he could freely render to an ordinary employer?<a name=169:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For the moment the government is his employer.<a name=169:2></a> It is not bondmanship in the ordinary sense but special service required in a respectful, considerate way by the government from its <i>subjects</i> -- provision being made for their consciences according to what Scripture enjoins as due to God.<a name=169:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am concerned as to 'Conscientious Objection' to work that in itself is quite within the range of what Scripture in no way forbids to a Christian, lest the objection be dishonest.<a name=169:17></a> That an intelligent godly man should 'conscientiously' object to performing services for the government which he would gladly render to an ordinary employer for regular wages is outside my understanding.<a name=169:18></a> That the government pays him much less, that he may be in uncongenial surroundings (ordinary working associations are usually so to a true Christian), that he may be under special limitations, for he is serving the King, whom he is directed by Scripture to obey and honour, that he may have to endure reproach because he cannot conscientiously be a regular soldier, all these considerations do not affect <i>basically</i> the position a brother is placed in by the present Military Service Act.<a name=169:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Of course, an enlightened Christian objects conscientiously to using the sword; this is fully owned, and even the 'Act' provides for this, but Scripture urges subjection to the authorities for <i>conscience</i> sake; <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#13:5">Romans  13:5</a>, 6.<a name=169:20></a> "For on this account

	<div class="paragraph">
		ye pay tribute also; for they are God's officers attending continually on this very thing".<a name=170:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Although they are God's officers, their rights over the Christian are obviously limited, for Christ's rights over him must come first; but these are by no means trenched on by the authorities requiring the believer, in view of an emergency, to perform certain duties that he could legitimately render to an ordinary employer.<a name=170:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That a tribunal should grant 'complete exemption' to a young brother because he says his conscience objects to performing such services as I have indicated in no way proves that the objection is justified by Scripture, and, if not, there is no testimony to the truth; on the contrary there is evidence of ignorance of Scripture, or -- which is, of course, worse -- unreality.<a name=170:3></a>

		Beloved Brother, -- Your letter came yesterday, and I write at once to say that I have sympathy with you and your family In view of what is before your two sons.<a name=174:18></a> I am sure God will help them in every way as they do what is right.<a name=174:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I wrote to Mr.<a name=174:20></a> Roberts was to make clear that government is of God and has authority from Him, and that the believer must respect this, and not only respect it but sympathise with it, making every provision for the rights of God.<a name=174:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Those who exercise government are, of course, but men, and may misuse the authority they possess, requiring those under them to disobey God, as is the case in some countries today; then, of course the Christian must, in regarding the rights of God refuse to obey men -- and suffer.<a name=174:22></a> But the abstract position is clearly set out in Scripture, especially in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#13">Romans  13</a>and the truly Christian conscience will recognise it and obey it.<a name=174:23></a> It is God's minister to <i>him</i> for good.<a name=174:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the present case the abstract thought of government is not violated, full provision being made for the enlightened believer's conscience as to taking human life, but plainly intimating that whatever needed services which the persons in question can render should be rendered.<a name=174:25></a> Thus the believer -- while shrinking from the possible evil associations, hardships and deprivations -- is subject and accedes to the wish or demands of the governments, not only because of any penalty if he disobeys, "but also on <i>account of conscience"</i>.<a name=174:26></a> Hence while conscience requires him <i>not</i> to take human life, It <i>requires</i> him to do many other things because the authorities order him to do them.<a name=174:27></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Above is, I am assured, the scriptural position.<a name=174:28></a> Unfairness or ignorance in those executing the law or authority may

		occasion the most painful consequences to some, and this is illustrated in the case you mention.<a name=175:1></a> But surely a government which is liberal as to Christian conscience would rectify -- if brought to its attention -- the unrighteousness of an officer compelling a young brother to use a rifle seeing the tribunal before which he appeared granted him exemption from combatant duties.<a name=175:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In writing above I have the keenest sympathy with the young men, but we are in most difficult days and we must recognise the government of God in what is transpiring and accept that He has something for each of us to learn in them.<a name=175:3></a> As we do He will be with us and bring us out of the ordeal capable of more for Him than we could be, had we not been through it (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#43:2">Isaiah  43:2</a>).<a name=175:4></a>

		Beloved Brother, -- Before answering E.<a name=175:9></a>R.<a name=175:10></a>'s enquiry, I had seen the Military Service Act (I have a copy of it) and also considerable correspondence as to it between brothers on your side of the Atlantic.<a name=175:11></a> Mr.<a name=175:12></a> Wilding had written to enquire also, and lately Mr.<a name=175:13></a> Diffey of Salisbury and a brother in Gloucester.<a name=175:14></a>

		Like yourself, the last two made no <i>specific</i> reference to what I wrote, but simply remarked on the subject in a general way.<a name=175:15></a>

		In the light of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#13">Romans  13</a>and similar scriptures, including Daniel and <a href="../bible/Zechariah.htm#6">Zechariah  6</a>, government in the hands of the powers above us, should not be regarded simply as the world.<a name=175:16></a> They are ordained of God and an instructed, exercised believer will be a 'conscientious objector' to anything contrary to this (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#13:5">Romans  13:5</a>).<a name=175:17></a> On the other hand, he will object to what interferes with the rights of God, and, knowing the Scriptures, he can name it.<a name=175:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus as before the tribunal he will avow his subjection In principle to the government, with the exception that, as a Christian, a follower of Jesus, he cannot disregard His teaching and example -- that he must obey God rather than men (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#5:29">Acts  5:29</a>).<a name=175:19></a>

		My exercise is that the young brothers, as before the tribunals should bear testimony to the truth.<a name=176:1></a> They are not doing so if they ignore the place God has given to those who rule -- the King, his ministers, parliament, etc.<a name=176:2></a>; if they object to work required by the government, which they would ordinarily undertake if they needed to do so to earn a living.<a name=176:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am very sympathetic with the young men, but the 'present necessity' is affecting all of us, and God's hand is surely in it, so that we might be gainers and prove the reality of what He has taught us.<a name=176:4></a> The Lord witnessed before Pontius Pilate a good confession and He owned that the Roman governor had power from above.<a name=176:5></a> As brothers take this attitude before the tribunals, stating their exercises as governed by the truth, the Lord will stand by them, and there will be testimony.<a name=176:6></a> If the chairman, discerning their sincerity, grants them total exemption they can thank God and accept; but this is very different from asking for or claiming total exemption.<a name=176:7></a> The latter is not fair, nor the demand of a good conscience before God.<a name=176:8></a>

		represents the army, and whilst Christians cannot undertake combatant service, they should be careful to express readiness to offer to do any non-combatant service that the government may require.<a name=177:1></a> Of course, an important consideration is that moral conditions or surroundings in connection with the army service may be worse than those found in relation to what is called 'service of national importance'.<a name=177:2></a> Thus Section B, as already stated, is a reasonable outlet from the worse evil of army associations.<a name=177:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"But and if thou canst become free, use it rather" (1 Corinthians 7: 21) is often quoted, but applied to this matter it would mean that the government releases one on truthful testimony from him.<a name=178:8></a> If it does release him from its own side on the testimony he renders as before God, then, of course, he can accept the liberty with thankfulness.<a name=178:9></a> Subdivision B of Section 5 seems a reasonable outlet for brethren in view of the moral side, for they would, in taking work contemplated there, undoubtedly come in contact with less that would tend to damage their souls than they would in army surroundings.<a name=178:10></a>

		Beloved Brother, -- During the last few days the brethren here have been much in spirit with our dear brethren in Great Britain, because of the persistent raiding by the Germans, knowing how increasingly trying this must be.<a name=191:8></a> But letters we have been receiving from many parts show unmistakably that God is with you all in these harrowing experiences.<a name=191:9></a> The Lord said to Smyrna, "the devil is about to cast of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days.<a name=191:10></a> Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give to thee the crown of life" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2:10">Revelation  2:10</a>).<a name=191:11></a> Satan's malice and terror are clearly in the current attacks, but the Lord is <i>observing</i> and will limit them.<a name=191:12></a> They are, however, for <i>trial</i>, and the information coming to us, shows that the raids are bringing out what is of God in His people.<a name=191:13></a> This is fragrant to Him, and there will be consolidated gain for you all, too.<a name=191:14></a> The saints walking in the truth in all places are with their brethren in Great Britain in spirit and in deep sympathy and prayers, sharing with you all, too, ministry of our Great High Priest above, which tends to lift us all out of the pressure into our own heavenly position.<a name=191:15></a> Evidently your meetings have this character as ours have -- the living well in us springing up into eternal life.<a name=191:16></a>

		Beloved Brother, -- I am very interested in the enquiry in your letter of the 13th inst.<a name=192:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards breaking bread with an invalid or isolated saint, the question arises as to the scriptural warrant for such action.<a name=192:8></a> It is clear from <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11">1 Corinthians  11</a>that the breaking of bread belongs to the assembly: "when ye come together in assembly".<a name=192:9></a> A single saint cannot afford assembly conditions in a locality.<a name=192:10></a> I mean that if the breaking of bread is to take place in a place there must be assembly conditions in some sense.<a name=192:11></a> For instance, if a meeting <i>had</i> been there and all the brothers had been removed, leaving some godly sisters who cared for the Lord's interests, I should be free to break bread with them -- the nearest meetings being agreeable.<a name=192:12></a> This was done in Montreal for a considerable time after the Bexhill division.<a name=192:13></a> It is also done -- or was done last year -- at the Isle of Man.<a name=192:14></a> In the latter place the brother was ill, but there were several godly sisters.<a name=192:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The position at Riverside is different.<a name=192:16></a> I have seen a letter from Nora Adair, but it cannot be said that assembly conditions exist in the town -- although our sister is godly.<a name=192:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have no recollection of holding or saying anything different to above on this point.<a name=192:18></a> In bygone years some would do what is suggested to be done at Riverside; the breaking of bread used to take place on ships at sea; but a ship is not properly a "place" or locality, and as the truth of <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11">1 Corinthians  11</a>was made clear, all such practices were abandoned.<a name=192:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am assured that God is hearing and answering the prayers of His people as to England and Great Britain generally.<a name=192:20></a> Copies of other letters more recently received have gone out to the gatherings this week.<a name=192:21></a> The manner in which our dear brethren are going through the ordeal, showing that God is with them as passing through the waters, is most stimulating.<a name=192:22></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For a good while it has appeared to me that God was taking a definite hand in the struggle and I am confirmed in this, and I believe that as the saints "have suffered for a little while" He will give relief and ultimate deliverance.<a name=193:17></a> That the scourging allowed should be so severe causes heart-searching, for we are all involved.<a name=193:18></a> Although the saints in America and Australasia are far from the actual scene of strife we are, I am sure, keenly suffering with you, as bound up with our brethren.<a name=193:19></a> This is true of none, perhaps, more than my wife and myself.<a name=193:20></a> Knowing you all so well, personally and circumstantially, we feel peculiarly that your sufferings are ours, and we truly suffer <i>with</i> you.<a name=193:21></a>

		Beloved Brother, -- Our dear brethren in London and suburban area are constantly on our hearts, indeed it is hard to keep from 'torment' as we think of you all and of our suffering brethren elsewhere in Great Britain, but the Lord in His priestly grace helps, enabling us to maintain a balanced mind.<a name=204:17></a>

		Beloved Brother, -- I received your letter of January 30th and as one from me to you should have crossed it, I postponed writing, especially as others were writing you.<a name=220:16></a> All the news you sent was welcome indeed and caused much cheer to us all here.<a name=220:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Since then much has happened in Great Britain, but on the whole, it seems to me, there is a slacking of the bombing -- although there have been some bad attacks -- and we thank God steadily for this, seeing His hand in it.<a name=220:18></a> The attack in the Balkans is also, it seems to me, to be taken as a diversion from God, as it will modify the sufferings of His people.<a name=220:19></a> What is but the size of a man's hand as relief now will become abundant later.<a name=220:20></a> "The God of measure" is over all the happenings and knows what can be endured -- for profit.<a name=220:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We were grieved by news -- through Mr.<a name=220:22></a> Penson -- of the Plymouth sorrow.<a name=220:23></a> I think, however, the saints are coming to take account of the falling asleep of the saints in such circumstances in a more balanced way and there is more restfulness.<a name=220:24></a> Of course we cannot but feel peculiarly as saints fall asleep through violence.<a name=220:25></a> The Lord feels it too, but the <i>natural</i> element, as in Jairus' house and Joppa, is utterly valueless.<a name=220:26></a>

		The saints in Toronto are enduring a great sorrow, as you will be hearing.<a name=220:27></a> Ten days ago a car-load of saints were returning from Rochester after weekend meetings and the machine turned into a depression and three were killed -- two of the most valued brothers in Ontario and one sister -- Ernest Pittman and John Thomson and the sister-in-law of the latter.<a name=220:28></a> And Mrs.<a name=220:29></a> John Thomson is very ill indeed in the hospital at Niagara.<a name=220:30></a> The saints at Toronto with us all are greatly distressed,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At London it was a cheer to us all to receive the cable signed by you and ------ , especially your reference to encouragement in Portsmouth.<a name=221:2></a> No doubt we shall hear more of this encouragement later.<a name=221:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You would receive a cable from London as to the meetings.<a name=221:4></a> The Lord helped much.<a name=221:5></a> We looked at the Confessors of Christ as Son of God.<a name=221:6></a> The subject served us well, the Lord's hand being over His people.<a name=221:7></a> The readings, except Lord's Day, were attended by invited brothers only.<a name=221:8></a> This was said to be occasioned by several unavoidable reasons, but it did not obtain general approval and I doubt that the change from the ordinary method will be repeated.<a name=221:9></a> The meeting in London is small and as the usual numbers attending this annual occasion run up to 500 - 600 the work involved is too much for them.<a name=221:10></a> But the Lord was definitely with us and so all is well.<a name=221:11></a>

		At Knoxville a fortnight ago we also had a very good season, looking at the persons said in Scripture to have been raised from the dead.<a name=221:12></a> Under date of May 24th -- 26th, God willing, there will be meetings in Winnipeg, and at the end of that month similar meetings at Rochester, both of which I hope to attend.<a name=221:13></a> Then in August my wife and I expect to start for New Zealand, attending meetings in the West en route to the steamer.<a name=221:14></a>

		As to the special matter you mention, I have long considered that <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#19:3">Matthew  19:3</a> - 12 is intended to govern such sorrowful histories.<a name=226:1></a> They cease to be sorrowful, however -- to some extent -- as God works in them.<a name=226:2></a> Evidently He has done so in the present case.<a name=226:3></a> The many such recorded in Scripture are remarkable.<a name=226:4></a> It is quite clear that legal fixities cannot prevent the work of God, nor can the worst crimes, arising from human lust, prevent it; "Where sin abounded grace has overabounded".<a name=226:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus if the man in question is manifestly repentant -- evidencing the work of God -- I would say he should be free to resume his place in the fellowship of Christ's death.<a name=226:6></a> I am encouraged to say so much because of divine compassion.<a name=226:7></a> "All <i>cannot</i> receive this word".<a name=226:8></a> Certain governmental restrictions will attend a brother in such a case.<a name=226:9></a> Such restrictions indeed always attach to persons whose conduct results in incongruous conditions -- occasioned by the law, usually bankrupts and divorced persons.<a name=226:10></a> The Lord's remarks are the more significant as they are reported by Matthew in whose gospel alone the truth of the assembly is given.<a name=226:11></a> But the instructions in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#19">Matthew  19</a>are stated in such a form as to condemn licence; it is compassionate as a provision meeting human weakness.<a name=226:12></a>

		As regards the reception of the Spirit by the believer, whether his own volition enters into it, this requires thoughtful consideration.<a name=249:31></a> 'Volition' is an act or choice of the will, and if applied to the reception of the Spirit it could only mean that the desire behind it is the fruit of the sovereign work of God in the person -- the new birth.<a name=249:32></a> Thus <a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>precedes chapter 4.<a name=249:33></a> In the latter the Lord says to the woman, "If thou knewest .<a name=249:34></a>.<a name=249:35></a>.<a name=249:36></a> thou wouldst have asked of him".<a name=249:37></a> "Thou wouldst have

		asked of him" is volition, but it is the outcome of a divinely effected state -- not a mere natural wish.<a name=250:1></a> In chapter 7 the thought is carried forward to reception.<a name=250:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#11">Luke  11</a>the power of asking is illustrated by the Lord, ending in "how much rather shall the Father who is of heaven give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him".<a name=250:3></a> The illustrations are taken from natural circumstances, but they run into spiritual circumstances.<a name=250:4></a> Volition is there throughout, only when the Holy Spirit is sought the renewed will or desire is evidenced.<a name=250:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Considering this great matter therefore, we are in the realm of divine operations and their results -- the results implying that while the Holy Spirit -- presented in the gospel -- is a gift by God to the believer, the gift supposes a desire for it, and this is the fruit of the new birth.<a name=250:6></a> The desire expressed in a request is volition, a formal act of the person.<a name=250:7></a> Thus there is a definite transaction between the Giver and the receiver.<a name=250:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How this takes place in a practical sense is a matter of spiritual understanding.<a name=250:9></a> Paul uses in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#19">Acts  19</a>the word "receive", which implies an inward action, but when the apostle laid his hands on the men "the Holy Spirit came upon them;" the word 'received' is not used.<a name=250:10></a> Their wish is not alluded to, but obviously it was there.<a name=250:11></a> On the other hand, in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#8">Acts  8</a>, in similar circumstances, the word "receive" is used several times.<a name=250:12></a> But while the word denotes inward action there is no suggestion of want of appreciation or mutual hesitation as to such a gift.<a name=250:13></a> The principle of 'giving and receiving' enters into this great matter the giving is God's act and hence the believer is acted upon; the idea of reception is more to express his appreciation of the gift than to show his volition in the act.<a name=250:14></a> Morally it could not be otherwise.<a name=250:15></a>

		Beloved Brother, -- Since your letter of March 25th came I have been visiting Canada -- Montreal, Perth, Toronto, Hamilton and London -- special meetings, as you will know, were held in the latter city.<a name=261:14></a> The Lord gave a good time -- we had 'Prayer in the book of Acts' at the readings.<a name=261:15></a> The subject bore on various features of the truth.<a name=261:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards government bonds, buying these is, of course, loaning to the government.<a name=261:17></a> The money in a way is Caesar's and should be rendered to him -- as he seeks it.<a name=261:18></a> But besides, government is ordained of God, and we are to be subject to it; to pray for it, for it is God's minister to us for good.<a name=261:19></a> Why then, if we have money to loan, should we not loan it to it as we would to others?<a name=261:20></a> What particular use the authorities make of the money Christians give or loan them is not really our business.<a name=261:21></a> They bear not the sword in vain, Scripture says therefore they are supposed to have a sword and if they buy a sword -- they must have it to maintain government.<a name=261:22></a> They are doing what Scripture recognises as needful.<a name=261:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We need to see clearly that government is one thing and Christianity is another.<a name=261:24></a> Those in authority need not be Christians; if men are true to Christ they will not be in such positions, for the Lord said that "all who take the sword shall perish by the sword;" also that "my kingdom is not of this world".<a name=261:25></a> At the same time He said to Pilate that he could have no authority against Him if it was not given him from above.<a name=261:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus while the Lord, on the one hand, shows that Christians should not use the sword, on the other He owns power from above for government in the hands of an unconverted man.<a name=261:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=262>[Page 262]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus the position could not be clearer -- ordained government as it is outwardly today is distinct from Christianity, but that Christians are <i>obligated</i> to it as set up of God.<a name=262:1></a> It would thus be unfair for us to deny to it what we would be free to grant to others.<a name=262:2></a>

		I am glad to hear of the Lord's Day afternoon readings in all the rooms and a combined one on the first Lord's Day of each month.<a name=262:3></a> The Lord's Day afternoon affords an excellent atmosphere for readings; the saints need a special meeting also in the middle of the week, such as is spoken of in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14">1 Corinthians  14</a>.<a name=262:4></a>

		The work of Christ on the cross could only be by a divine Person, involving <i>more</i> than priesthood, and hence, the comparatively few verbal references to priesthood in the types of the work of atonement, for the Spirit would keep the Victim's <i>Person</i> in view, rather than an official title.<a name=263:1></a> But still essential priesthood was present.<a name=263:2></a> Aaron was anointed, as priest, before the victim was slain, also with his sons after.<a name=263:3></a>

		There was no mention of priesthood in the institution of the passover, although priests are spoken of in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#19:6">Exodus  19:6</a>, 24; but it has a great place in Leviticus; the tabernacle being set up, and Aaron slays and offers in chapter 9.<a name=263:4></a> The same is seen in chapter 16.<a name=263:5></a> Although he is not called priest in doing the work, yet in chapter 16, the linen garments show that priesthood was recognised as present.<a name=263:6></a>

		As regards the delinquencies you mention, the question is how they can be dealt with with actual conscientious feeling and power which assembly action requires, seeing those who would take part hardly know the persons, and can hardly possess <i>accurate</i> information as to the facts.<a name=264:1></a> The apostle says, "<i>being such</i>" or 'such a one', not having been such, <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5:5">1 Corinthians  5:5</a>.<a name=264:2></a> What you suggest is a sort of a 'spring cleaning' and in the types this is implied, as in <a href="../bible/2Chronicles.htm#29">2 Chronicles  29</a>.<a name=264:3></a> Also the High Priest cleansed the sanctuary on the day of atonement.<a name=264:4></a> But I am doubtful of anything being effective, a long period of time being involved, save by those immediately responsible, i.<a name=264:5></a>e.<a name=264:6></a>, as present in the locality at the time of the sin, for in this dispensation the <i>person</i> is dealt with, not simply the sin abstractly; and he should be seen if possible before a judgment is rendered by the assembly.<a name=264:7></a> <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#4">Leviticus  4</a>, of course, has force, but the above remarks apply -- there must be enquiry as to persons directly involved -- what is their state now?<a name=264:8></a>

		Reports of the Tract Depot and the desire to have it brought back to London causes one uneasiness, especially as it seems that some wish it to be a centre to which they may go to enquire or seek counsel in regard to current matters or emergencies.<a name=273:16></a> This is a metropolitan idea that has long since been judged as damaging.<a name=273:17></a> The Tract Depot is intended to spread the truth universally through writing and not as a central place of instruction or information.<a name=273:18></a> The latter, if taking form, could only interfere with the truth of the temple of God as available in local gatherings.<a name=273:19></a> Of course, there is the idea of the wisdom, the gift of government, among the saints, but these should not be centred in any particular place.<a name=273:20></a> I earnestly hope the Lord will save the brethren from being diverted from right principles in these matters.<a name=273:21></a>

		Beloved Brother, -- I received your letter of the 1st instant and I appreciate your expression of regret, etc.<a name=275:22></a> Had I known that there was any different view as to <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:22">Ephesians  1:22</a>, 23, from that which I have often given expression to, I should probably have observed alterations in the text of the MS.<a name=275:23></a> in question, but I had no knowledge of it until I received Mr.<a name=275:24></a> ------'s letter.<a name=275:25></a> The passage you refer to in 'Names of Divine Persons', page 23, was in no way intended to convey any other thought than that which Mr.<a name=275:26></a> Darby's translation furnishes.<a name=275:27></a> In that passage, as you will have observed, I stressed "given" to convey that the place of headship over all things

	<div class="paragraph">
		was seen there as given to Christ, and not the outcome of His Person as in Colossians.<a name=276:1></a> I had no idea of connecting the word given with the assembly by itself.<a name=276:2></a> I used it in the sense that it was granted, or given to Him to take the position stated, that is, head over all things to the assembly.<a name=276:3></a> I note in your letter to Mr.<a name=276:4></a> Parker of the 9th instant, that you say that, the Greek word in the passage is universally translated 'give'.<a name=276:5></a> It may be that you use the word universally in the sense of generally, at any rate, the word is translated otherwise many times, particularly as <i>grant</i>.<a name=276:6></a> But I quite accept the word 'give', but in the sense that it refers to the Lord Himself -- something given to Him.<a name=276:7></a> In <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#19">Revelation  19</a>it is said as to the bride, "It was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen".<a name=276:8></a> <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#1:29">Philippians  1:29</a> should also be noted.<a name=276:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I quite see that the original structure is somewhat difficult and is evidently regarded so by scholars, but Mr.<a name=276:10></a> Darby's translation, confirmed by the authorised version and the revised authorised version, should heavily weigh with us in the matter.<a name=276:11></a> The Spirit of God in the passage is enlarging on what God has made Christ, and to make verse 22 mean that among these glories and honour He is given to the assembly, is making too much of the assembly.<a name=276:12></a> Whereas, if we accept that it is given to Him to be head over all things to the assembly, the main thought of glorifying Him is maintained.<a name=276:13></a> At the same time the assembly is honoured in her own relative place in that she is associated in headship, which is strengthened by the statement that she is His body, the fulness of Him, who fills all in all.<a name=276:14></a> This is in keeping with the general teaching of Scripture as to the relative position of man and woman, for the man was not made for the woman but the woman for the man, and the woman was given to the man -- not the man to the woman.<a name=276:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not think I need say more, and from what I have said you will see that I do not agree with your view of this passage.<a name=276:16></a> But I do not regard that it should be made a matter of controversy.<a name=276:17></a> I would add that as you directed Mr.<a name=276:18></a> Parker to look at the October number of the Notes of 1941 for confirmation, I have examined the original MS.<a name=276:19></a>, "He is given to be head over all things to the assembly which is His body".<a name=276:20></a> The printed page 199 reads, 'It is as head over all things that He is given to the assembly which is His body'.<a name=276:21></a> This change was not made either by Mr.<a name=276:22></a> Parker or myself.<a name=276:23></a> As I said to ------ ,

		I can understand that you could have made this change with the understanding that it agreed with what I held.<a name=277:1></a> In view of this peculiar situation arising, it seems that it is a good opportunity to review the matter of authorship as related to the publication of ministry.<a name=277:2></a> It is quite clear that authorship and editorship should have their full place and responsibility in all publications, and that if the publisher is forced, under certain conditions, to make changes, it should be as sparingly as possible, and that he should make no important changes at all unless he consults the author or editor of a paper.<a name=277:3></a> In view of the unprecedented delays in mails, some alterations may need to be made by the publisher, but these should not affect doctrine.<a name=277:4></a>

		Beloved Brother, -- Your letter of August 14th was duly received.<a name=280:15></a> I had written to you on July 31st covering some of the points you mentioned, and I hope my letter has reached you.<a name=280:16></a> As regards my letter to Mr.<a name=280:17></a> Ide, part of which you saw, I will say very definitely that in writing to him I had the general position of the Tract Depot in mind and in no sense was I writing as one trespassed against.<a name=280:18></a> Your letter is largely to satisfy me as to possible infringements of my rights, but all you write in this respect is wholly beside the mark.<a name=280:19></a> In writing to Mr.<a name=280:20></a> Ide I was, as I said, concerned about the submerging of the rights of authors and editors in the extensive way in which you revise and change at will manuscripts sent to the Depot for publication.<a name=280:21></a> I am assuming that what I have observed in the papers sent from New York represents what is done on all such manuscripts.<a name=280:22></a>

		This has come to my attention quite recently, almost entirely through the letter I received from ------ relative to <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:22">Ephesians  1:22</a>.<a name=280:23></a> ------'s letter led me to examine certain copies of Notes

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		which I had revised and also which Mr.<a name=281:1></a> Parker had revised and sent to you for publication.<a name=281:2></a> I may say that since these New York Readings began to be published, I had never seen a MS.<a name=281:3></a> of them after I had made a general revision of it.<a name=281:4></a> ------'s inquiry led me to look at several, which Mr.<a name=281:5></a> Parker kept, so as to make comparison with what appeared in the printed page which he had questioned.<a name=281:6></a> I examined particularly the MS.<a name=281:7></a> I had revised and which also Mr.<a name=281:8></a> Parker in due course revised and forwarded to you, and found that you had made about eighty changes in the paper after it had been revised by myself first and then by Mr.<a name=281:9></a> Parker.<a name=281:10></a> Several of the changes you made were deletions of questions and answers, and in one particular case a change of a remark by me relative to <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:22">Ephesians  1:22</a>.<a name=281:11></a> This alteration I noted in my letter to you of July 31st, and I am referring now not to the rightness or the wrongness of the change you made, but the fact that you made it without any reference to Mr.<a name=281:12></a> Parker or to me.<a name=281:13></a> I am referring also to the fact that the extent of your revision of articles constitutes you practice a chief editor, and consequently all articles for publication in the Stow Hill Depot not only come under your notice so that nothing in a <i>general</i> way should be published contrary to the truth, but that you edit articles, altering them at will and this to the extent of altering a paper structurally, revising it throughout in the ordinary sense of the word.<a name=281:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I was very thankful when you took on your primary services in the Depot as manager of it, and profited much by help from you from time to time, and had given you liberty to treat my articles in a cursory way so as to prevent mistakes of any kind, but I had no idea that you intended to treat articles as you now manifestly do, and I am thinking not only of your present service but of the office that you have created, that it is not in keeping with a publishing house among the saints, for as I have said, it will obscure authorship and editorship, and hence cause friction among those who serve in these respects.<a name=281:15></a> You may not be always available, but the office will stand and whoever takes on the work will in all probability pursue your methods.<a name=281:16></a> My exercise therefore in writing Mr.<a name=281:17></a> Ide, was that this whole position might be looked into and rectified before it is too late.<a name=281:18></a> That general oversight of papers to be published is necessary is quite obvious, and your work, as I have said, at the outset was good and as far as I am concerned it was in my mind good until the papers I have referred to had to be

	<div class="paragraph">
		Returning to your letter of August 14th I have been distressed to find alterations in MSS.<a name=282:9></a> which I had not known of when I wrote you on July 31st.<a name=282:10></a> One of the alterations is in 'Names of Divine Persons', page 23.<a name=282:11></a> When I wrote you I had not seen the revised edition of this book, but on looking at it two days ago, I note that the paragraph has changes which support your view of <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:22">Ephesians  1:22</a>, and I am certain I never made these changes when looking over the book in view of another edition.<a name=282:12></a> I believe I sent you a copy with what little alterations I suggested, but it is morally impossible that I could have made the changes that I find in the new edition.<a name=282:13></a> The old edition reads in the beginning of the last paragraph of that page, 'In Ephesians He is <i>given</i> to be Head over all things to the assembly'.<a name=282:14></a> Whereas, the new edition has, 'In Ephesians He is made Head over all things and <i>given</i> to the assembly'.<a name=282:15></a> Again in that same paragraph the first edition has, 'He is taken by the exceeding greatness of the power of God out of death and set at His right hand in the heavenlies over all as Head to the assembly'.<a name=282:16></a> In the second edition this sentence reads, 'He is taken out of death by the exceeding greatness of God's power and is set at His right hand in the heavenlies over all as Head, and given to the assembly'.<a name=282:17></a> I became very uneasy when

		I discovered these changes and as I have said, they could not have been made by me.<a name=283:1></a> A passage in Readings in New York in 1933 is unquestionable evidence that I did not hold such a view of <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:22">Ephesians  1:22</a> as appears in the second edition of 'Divine Names'.<a name=283:2></a> The passage I refer to is on pages 319 - 320, which you can easily find.<a name=283:3></a> But apart from any statements of mine, I am quite certain that I never held this view and that I never quoted intentionally <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:22">Ephesians  1:22</a> save as it appears in the New Translation and the Authorised Versions.<a name=283:4></a> As regards <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:22">Ephesians  1:22</a> I need say no more as my letter of July 31st covers the matter fully from my point of view.<a name=283:5></a>

		Now as to <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21">Numbers  21</a>.<a name=283:6></a> I have to point out that changes have been made in the New York Readings of August, 1942, contrary to what I hold as to the teaching of verses 16 - 18 of that chapter.<a name=283:7></a> The first change is on page 21 of the MS.<a name=283:8></a>, and page 144 of the magazine.<a name=283:9></a> In the former, in answer to a question by A.<a name=283:10></a>R.<a name=283:11></a>, I say, 'Our hymn singing is very important in assembly service, as helping us to move into the presence of God'.<a name=283:12></a> And then in answer to a question of H.<a name=283:13></a>H.<a name=283:14></a>, I refer to 'the idea of alternate singing' and that 'Miriam represented that as a sort of ministerial side'.<a name=283:15></a> The magazine reads, 'Our hymn singing is very important in assembly service, as helping us to move into the presence of God.<a name=283:16></a> In <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21:17">Numbers  21:17</a> singing conveys the idea of alternate singing: that we respond in song to the Spirit's movements and suggestions in assembly'.<a name=283:17></a> The clause just quoted, that 'we respond in song to the Spirit's movements and suggestions in assembly', is attributed to me, and the phrase does not convey my understanding of the passage in question.<a name=283:18></a> Singing to the well, or in type to the Spirit, is not simply responding in song to the Spirit's movements and suggestions, but the Spirit Himself.<a name=283:19></a> "Sing ye unto it", was quoted by Mr.<a name=283:20></a> Hardwick, whose quotation evidently has been deleted by you.<a name=283:21></a> The truth, however, is plainly stated in the first paragraph of the page referred to in the magazine, but the words attributed to me already quoted are not mine, and, as I said, do not represent the truth.<a name=283:22></a> Another change is on page 145 of the magazine.<a name=283:23></a> On page 22 of the MS.<a name=283:24></a>, in answer to a remark of F.<a name=283:25></a>N.<a name=283:26></a>W.<a name=283:27></a>, I say, 'Rise up well, sing unto it, well which princes digged'.<a name=283:28></a> Then I go on to say clearly 'the well is the objective in the words that are given'.<a name=283:29></a> Whereas, in the magazine these words of mine do not appear.<a name=283:30></a>

		Further, as to this subject, in your letter to Mr.<a name=284:1></a> Parker of June 11th, you say, 'It is a little puzzling to know how it is that J.<a name=284:2></a>T.<a name=284:3></a> so understands the verse of Hymn 126, and I might mention that it is not the first time that he has so expressed himself.<a name=284:4></a> Previously I have just deleted it.<a name=284:5></a> And then again, the first line of verse 3 is not an address to the Holy Spirit, but is directed to God for the gift.<a name=284:6></a> Further, J.<a name=284:7></a>T.<a name=284:8></a> speaks of following the scriptural example and says that',This, however, is sparing .<a name=284:9></a>.<a name=284:10></a>.<a name=284:11></a>'.<a name=284:12></a> In point of fact it is so sparing that it does not occur anywhere as far as I can see'.<a name=284:13></a> I furnish this quotation from your letter to call attention to the liberty you take, as you say, in deleting something of mine off hand.<a name=284:14></a> I do not know what passages you refer to as deleted, I only refer to the way you speak of the matter.<a name=284:15></a> Then as to verse 3 of hymn 126, you say it is directed to God, whereas verse 2, which immediately precedes, is directed to Christ, not God.<a name=284:16></a> Verse 3 in the original primarily referred directly to the Holy Spirit, and the spirit of the hymn plainly shows that even if verse 3 stands, we should keep in mind that the Spirit is to be viewed objectively, and that <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21">Numbers  21</a>supports this.<a name=284:17></a> As I said elsewhere, I am not advocating that we should address the Spirit in any formal way, but I do believe that we should keep Him before us as an Object in the Trinity.<a name=284:18></a> <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21">Numbers  21</a>speaks of Him typically as viewed in this way in song.<a name=284:19></a> You make a great deal of the so-called authorities as to the use of the word "sing" in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21:17">Numbers  21:17</a>, but the fact remains that Scripture elsewhere uses the same word for singing in an objective sense.<a name=284:20></a> While the original word implies sometimes alternate singing, yet this singing is to some person or thing objectively viewed by the singers as in passages in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#32">Exodus  32</a>, 1, <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#18">1 Samuel  18</a>, <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#27">Isaiah  27</a>, and <a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#2">Hosea  2</a>.<a name=284:21></a> The fact that it is used far more frequently for the ordinary idea of 'answering' does not set aside the fact that the New Translation and Authorised Versions retain it in the text, and that hence there must be good ground for such usage.<a name=284:22></a> Strong's Concordance to which you refer, says amongst other things, 'specially to sing' and again 'singing together by course'.<a name=284:23></a> Therefore, as we sing together by course to the well it plainly implies that we sing to the Spirit.<a name=284:24></a> Miriam and the women of Israel would sing to Jehovah on that principle, and so will Israel in the future sing to Jehovah on that principle according to <a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#2">Hosea  2</a>, and therefore, the singing to the well is also on that principle.<a name=284:25></a>

		In your letter to Mr.<a name=285:1></a> Parker of August 10th you say, 'In thinking of such a matter I would look for a basis in some passage in the New Testament and would hesitate to base it on a type, but rather interpret the type by the New Testament'.<a name=285:2></a> These remarks discredit the Old Testament scriptures.<a name=285:3></a> The Lord says, "the scripture cannot be broken".<a name=285:4></a> Typical language is as intelligible and expressive, if we understand it by the Spirit, as is the language of the New Testament.<a name=285:5></a> The types often add to New Testament statements of truth.<a name=285:6></a> The subject of the Spirit, as spoken under the symbol of a 'springing well' and 'rivers', is treated in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>and 7, and it is remarkable that the Lord in dealing with this subject in chapter 7 says, "He that believes on me, as the scripture has said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water".<a name=285:7></a> The Lord confirms what He says by referring to the Old Testament.<a name=285:8></a> The living water referred to in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>is enlarged upon by <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21">Numbers  21</a>.<a name=285:9></a>

		sympathy should permeate all so that in a given item of service in printed ministry the order should stand: author, editor, publisher, all under the Lord's hand working in the mutuality of love.<a name=287:1></a> The author has the most spiritual place of the three, and the characteristics which mark the work of God in him m relation to his service should enter into his article or paper, and therefore, his phraseology, so long as it is in conformity with all rules governing it, should stand and not be altered to conform with the literary views of those who may help in preparing it.<a name=287:2></a> It is a natural disposition in an editor of MSS.<a name=287:3></a> not his own to make changes according to his literary taste or use of language.<a name=287:4></a> Whereas, all such changes are of no value but perhaps the contrary.<a name=287:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Of course, in readings many take part, but it is obvious that the brother who proposes the subject in a reading and leads in opening it up has to be regarded as responsible for what is unfolded, and so he is in principle the author, and his way of presenting the truth should be allowed to stand, save, of course, that actual errors or omissions in doctrine, grammar, etc.<a name=287:6></a>, should be adjusted.<a name=287:7></a> If adjustments are contrary to what he might be understood to agree with, he should be consulted before they are made.<a name=287:8></a> All the above remarks under this head will, I am sure, commend themselves to you as obviously right, and I believe the Lord would help the brethren in looking into this matter before Him so that there may be nothing to hamper the free action of intelligent love.<a name=287:9></a>

		Beloved Brother, -- My wife and I were very pleased to receive your letter of August 31st and read it with much interest.<a name=289:12></a> The brethren in Barbados and the West Indies generally are on our hearts much, especially in view of the economic and food conditions.<a name=289:13></a> Today it is reported by the government that the sinkings in the Western Atlantic are greatly reduced, and we hope this will result in a relief of the food question in all the countries.<a name=289:14></a>

		As regards meetings for ministry, I would connect these with the temple where God speaks, and not with disciplinary matters.<a name=289:15></a> It is quite in order, however, to solemnly meet according to an earlier appointment after a ministry meeting, to administer discipline.<a name=289:16></a> The Lord would be with us in the way of support at such a meeting.<a name=289:17></a> Of course, He would also be with us at the earlier meeting for ministry, but His attitude and the attitude of the saints would be in keeping with such a meeting.<a name=289:18></a> We in New York, distances being so great, usually have any meetings needed for discipline after ministry meetings or what is called the city meeting, where all the saints are supposed to gather.<a name=289:19></a> We find the Lord's help in this procedure.<a name=289:20></a> As regards the Bank Hall meeting, I am sorry that it has grown 'poor', and if there is any life there in the regular sense, the Lord would, I am sure, appreciate the city brethren supporting it as much as possible.<a name=289:21></a> If, however, assembly conditions have failed or disappeared, it is quite clear that it should not continue.<a name=289:22></a> But it would be a great victory if on the principle of supporting it that new life should be infused by prayer and visitations.<a name=289:23></a> A local assembly should carry with it the idea of representation of God and if this has characteristically ceased to exist, it is clear that it should be discontinued.<a name=289:24></a> The Scriptures,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But while writing the above my conscience is by no means satisfied by your reply to the part of my letter which refers to the past -- what is shown as extended revisions by ------ of articles for publication without the knowledge of those directly responsible for them; and what is more serious, alterations made in those articles contrary to the truth as held by the author of them.<a name=292:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another matter of grave importance is that ------ states in a cable and letter to me that the alterations and deletions were made in the magazine to save paper and that other MSS.<a name=292:4></a> were not so treated; whereas the copy of the book 'The Second Established', just received, shows that this is not true, for it has proportionately a much greater number of changes than appear in the magazine.<a name=292:5></a> ------ wrote me of <i>one</i> of the changes, but said nothing of the <i>general revision</i> of the MSS.<a name=292:6></a> he was making.<a name=292:7></a> But I am writing now not of the character of his revision but of the fact that he cabled that he did <i>not</i> make it -- that is, that he did not make extensive alterations in such MSS.<a name=292:8></a> as the book mentioned represents.<a name=292:9></a> His cable of September 24th reads, 'The many changes monthly manuscript solely due necessary deletion over matter for pages available .<a name=292:10></a>.<a name=292:11></a>.<a name=292:12></a> other manuscripts never so treated as printing pages not limited'.<a name=292:13></a> With the help of J.<a name=292:14></a>T.<a name=292:15></a> Jr.<a name=292:16></a> , I have made careful examination of three readings on Job and I find that an average of 141 changes in <i>each</i> reading have been made, and by general observation I can see that all the other articles in the book have been subjected to the same proportionate changes.<a name=292:17></a> Because the original paper used in the Notes on Job was heavy and the revisions extensive, I had copies made on light paper which I sent to Kingston, so that as possessing the original MSS.<a name=292:18></a>, I am able to compare them with the book.<a name=292:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards the changes made in the booklet 'Names of Divine Persons', while making due allowance for the feebleness of memory, it is morally impossible for me to accept ------'s explanation of the matter as given by you.<a name=292:20></a> That the two changes <i>if</i> made in the same paragraph of the copy he sent

		could have escaped my eye is utterly unlikely.<a name=293:1></a> Whether they were made in pencil or ink I would surely notice them, especially as going over for a second edition a paper which had been severely attacked.<a name=293:2></a> And if I did notice them, I would certainly have deleted them as contrary to the standard translations of the passage of scripture involved, which I always accepted as right.<a name=293:3></a> The truth is, as I <i>definitely</i> remember, ------ sent me a copy of the booklet without any proposed changes, and I made what few alterations I thought needful and returned the booklet.<a name=293:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think it right to say here that in commending his view of <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:22">Ephesians  1:22</a>, ------ wrote Mr.<a name=293:5></a> Parker to look at page 23 of 'Names of Divine Persons' as affording proof that I agreed with him.<a name=293:6></a> ------ added that I had gone over the booklet very carefully because of the opposition it had encountered.<a name=293:7></a> He also directed Mr.<a name=293:8></a> Parker to October, 1941 number of the New York magazine, to obtain the same proof, but what he had in mind was my statement in that number which he (Mr.<a name=293:9></a> ------ ) had altered, as stated in my letter of September 1st.<a name=293:10></a> In letters to ------ I suggested twice that ------ in making the changes in question may have thought I agreed with him as to <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:22">Ephesians  1:22</a>, but I subsequently cancelled this, as my conscience does not now admit that our brother could have this thought, for having searched, I cannot find any foundation on which to base it; on the contrary I have found much to negate it.<a name=293:11></a> I have always accepted the rendering of the passage in the New Translation and the Authorised Versions, and I am getting ready for the press Notes of Readings at Indianapolis of last November in which comments based on them are included.<a name=293:12></a> At that time I knew nothing of the view ------ advances.<a name=293:13></a> I have no wish to discredit ------ , but I most certainly believe he should own and repudiate the manifest wrong doings that I have furnished proof of in my communications to him and to you; also that the roots of which they are the fruits should be searched out and judged.<a name=293:14></a> As to yourselves, the word comes to me "the glory of kings is to search out a thing" (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#25:2">Proverbs  25:2</a>).<a name=293:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Concerning the number of the magazine in which the eighty changes were made, it was that of October, 1941, not August, 1942.<a name=293:16></a> Mr.<a name=293:17></a> Parker made <i>some</i> of the alterations in this as he has done in all numbers, but he and I made due allowance for these and calculated with practical accuracy, as we believe, that the eighty were in addition to those he made.<a name=293:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Beloved Brother, -- I duly received your letters of October 13th and December 4th, and I am touched by the humble attitude as to the distressing situation in the Stow Hill Depot expressed in both.<a name=299:10></a> I should have replied to the first earlier only I was awaiting the answer from the trustees to my letter of October 31st.<a name=299:11></a> This came lately and it confirms what you wrote of your own exercises.<a name=299:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am writing the trustees to express my thankfulness for the lowly character of your regrets and confessions.<a name=299:13></a> I am waiting on the Lord as to the whole matter -- that I may have a right judgment of what you have written -- that I may be fair, and free to pray for you without reserve as I am able to see that you are with God.<a name=299:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		No one should have a better knowledge than you of the moral and business principles entering into the management of a Tract Depot -- an institution possessing a levitical and hence a holy character.<a name=299:15></a> Mutual feeling and consideration in those responsibly active as excluding all personal exploitation is essential to the success of such a service through the blessing of God.<a name=299:16></a> I assumed the Stow Hill Depot possessed all these features and placed the most implicit confidence in the trustees and in yourself.<a name=299:17></a> So that there was no need for any one to apologise for you to me.<a name=299:18></a> As you know, I said to ------ more than once as to the changes made in the magazine that you must have <i>thought</i> that they represented my mind, although I had no ground for saying this save confidence in your integrity.<a name=299:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But as other similar alterations came to light my mind was forced to the opposite view; and at the present moment a
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=300>[Page 300]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		certain anxious inquiry lurks in it: How could a brother long experienced in critical examinations and revisions change a statement of another to an opposite meaning four or five times in the same number of papers in the hands of the former for publication, the changes in each case being practically identical, and supportive of a special view or doctrine held by the brother who made the changes, and yet within a comparatively short period afterwards the brother cannot tell why he made them?<a name=300:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing weighing on my mind is a letter from Mr.<a name=300:2></a> G------ written shortly after he had a long conversation with you at your request, and after Mr.<a name=300:3></a> G------ had conferred with the trustees concerning my letter to them regarding the many changes made in the book 'The Second Established'.<a name=300:4></a> Mr.<a name=300:5></a> G------ says you had no explanation to offer as to the changes you made in the magazines and booklet, and as to those made in the Notes on Job, you said you thought you were expected to make them -- notwithstanding that you wrote and cabled to me that what you did on such productions was nothing or negligible.<a name=300:6></a> Mr.<a name=300:7></a> G------ stressed the so-called extenuating circumstances, and intimated that these largely cancelled the wrongdoing; and that while you felt things before God, the whole matter was a surprise to you, although also a 'calamity'.<a name=300:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The true way to reach a result as to extenuating circumstances is to weigh them separately and deduct the total from the total facts: thus if you were requested to take care of 'errors and omissions' in an article and you make instead almost a re-revision, involving 140 changes, saying at the same time that you made no changes at all in such MSS.<a name=300:9></a>, the extenuating circumstances are hardly worth mentioning.<a name=300:10></a>

		You have been ill from time to time and you are the subject of prayer by the brethren on this account.<a name=300:11></a> I trust your health is improved.<a name=300:12></a> You are a comparatively young man, your mind clear and energetic, and as helped of God, who is ever available to us, you should, it seems to me, have been able to meet this whole matter as it arose in a more practical and definite way.<a name=300:13></a> You have been resentful because, as you said, you have been questioned for doing what you had been doing for ten years.<a name=300:14></a> The questioning has been almost entirely by me, and I had not the slightest idea that your methods were such as they have been shown to have been.<a name=300:15></a> As the full truth came to light I

		The teaching as to the collection in 1 and 2 Corinthians is such as to lift the actual money involved to a spiritual level.<a name=305:17></a> The empty box is <i>only</i> material as on the table in an empty room, and the same is true as to the bread and cup -- that is, they are material.<a name=305:18></a> It is when the saints are together in assembly in relation to them that they (the bread and cup) take on a spiritual significance.<a name=305:19></a> The box itself has no spiritual meaning.<a name=305:20></a> What is placed in it, however, has a spiritual meaning -- the gifts of the saints expressing their love.<a name=305:21></a> This love is the outcome of the love of God shed abroad in their hearts.<a name=305:22></a> The love of the Father for the Son is in them according to the Lord's prayer in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>.<a name=305:23></a> Then a comparison of the <i>Bridegroom's</i> valuation of the love of His spouse in the Song of Songs would prevent us from making the love of the saints (the expression of it) in any way unsuitable to be set down in relation to the love of Christ.<a name=305:24></a> In a sense love is love in whomsoever it may be.<a name=305:25></a> John's epistle helps greatly as to this.<a name=305:26></a> The love of Christ for the assembly is greater than the love of the assembly for Christ.<a name=305:27></a> But they meet at the Lord's supper, and the Lord would not have us stress any inequality.<a name=305:28></a> The Lord's supper as celebrated is a public matter, and the love of the saints -- of the assembly -- has <i>part</i> in it.<a name=305:29></a> The Lord says: "By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine if ye have love among yourselves".<a name=305:30></a> This is just after He had said that they should love one another as He had <i>loved</i> them.<a name=305:31></a> Thus it is perfectly clear that the love of the saints for Christ and for one another has the <i>same character as His</i> love for them.<a name=305:32></a>

		I believe the bread and cup should be <i>together</i> -- -the box should not be placed between them; but beyond this there is little to say.<a name=306:2></a> As I said, physically they are on the same level; the spiritual meaning comes in when the saints are convened; and as to relative spiritual values, they (the saints) are normally discriminative.<a name=306:3></a> We should certainly hold to the suitability of the expression of the love of the assembly having a place in relation to the Lord's supper.<a name=306:4></a>

		I am not sure what you have in mind in regard to the Roman Catholic hospital, but I assume your inquiry is as to whether one in fellowship could be free to enter it for treatment if necessary.<a name=313:18></a> I should avoid this unless no other was available and I should avoid eating in a restaurant connected in any way with idolatry or such connections as play-houses.<a name=313:19></a> In the ordering of God the Christian can usually find what he needs in ordinary life without defiling his conscience.<a name=313:20></a>

		While principle enters into this matter, Christians might be free to use a certain convenience, but if he has a tender conscience he would be disposed to avoid even what principle might admit.<a name=313:21></a> The apostle says, "All things are lawful, but all are not profitable; all things are lawful, but all do not edify".<a name=313:22></a> The passage I quote in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10">1 Corinthians  10</a>, helps on these points.<a name=313:23></a> The instruction conveyed contemplates a low state of things spiritually at Corinth and the apostle is making all possible allowance in the sense of principle for conduct, or associations that seem unavoidable.<a name=313:24></a> One might assume to have power to go

	<div class="paragraph">
		Brethren with whom the young men are in fellowship are not known and, hence, not recognised in Canada, and, hence, the testimony their conscience claims is questioned and denied.<a name=316:26></a> Whereas, as the facts are known, it is clear that they hold the truth of Christ's death and that they are walking with those -- their names and associations being attested -- who do, and that those who teach them hold the truth, their parents, too, possibly.<a name=316:27></a> Why should not all this evidence of the truth and of persons who hold and teach it be furnished to the authorities as they are ready to receive it and to act upon it?<a name=316:28></a>

		Beloved Brother, -- A legal divorce would forbid the persons involved to return to the married relation except by a new marriage contract; mutual separation leaves the door open for reconciliation without recourse to law.<a name=324:7></a> In the case you mention the divorcer is the woman and her act cuts her off from any legal claim on the man except that for certain reasons the court ordered an allowance.<a name=324:8></a> But for the divorced person to open his house for the one who divorced him would be immoral.<a name=324:9></a> Legally the divorcer is in no different relation to her divorced husband than any other woman.<a name=324:10></a> I am referring to the matter purely from the standpoint of the law of the land.<a name=324:11></a> And a question might arise as to whether a Christian divorced according to the law of the land but not according to the law of God, there being no adultery involved, should take advantage of his legal freedom and marry again, and whether this would affect Christian fellowship, in case he was in it, or sought to be in it.<a name=324:12></a> The judgment of the assembly enters into this and the general state and history of the brother should be considered.<a name=324:13></a> But as to the position abstractly, I believe <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#7:15">1 Corinthians  7:15</a> should govern it, that is as linked with <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#19:10">Matthew  19:10</a> - 12.<a name=324:14></a> The latter scripture connected with <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#7:9">1 Corinthians  7:9</a> is a merciful provision in view of the capabilities of the person in question.<a name=324:15></a> If the woman has married again, of course, the matter is all the clearer -- that the man is not bound.<a name=324:16></a> The first divorce having occurred when the man was unconverted need not enter into the case, it seems to me.<a name=324:17></a>

		of January 5th, 1943, formally proposed that papers questionable -- my own or others -- might be adjusted by the trustees including the aid of capable available brothers.<a name=330:1></a> The following is the section of my letter which contains my suggestion: --
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'I would humbly suggest that you secure the aid of a few brothers capable of detecting anything contrary to the truth in papers sent in for publication.<a name=330:2></a> Their services should not need to be more than cursory and in general affecting only papers specially requiring critical attention .<a name=330:3></a>.<a name=330:4></a>.<a name=330:5></a> their work would insure safety and also greatly relieve the Depot manager upon whom, under the trustees, the main responsibility would rest.<a name=330:6></a> The suggestion I am making should not interfere with your decision to return to authors for reconsideration all questionable statements in their papers'.<a name=330:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This paragraph of my letter should afford plenty of scope for such corrections as the recent cables which I received from Stow Hill indicated some needed in the MSS.<a name=330:8></a> of the book 'Christ's Kingdom not of this World'.<a name=330:9></a> Those of this MSS.<a name=330:10></a> which you mention have, as I said, not yet come.<a name=330:11></a> But I have no doubt they also would come under the same heading.<a name=330:12></a> In this event I shall regard that all will be adjusted.<a name=330:13></a> You all are now well aware of the great amount of <i>time</i> needed for correspondence via Atlantic mail.<a name=330:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I need not point out that the word "Jordan" substituted for the word "water" in the May number, and the word 'but' inserted in the June number of the New York Readings -- details in your letter -- would be adjustments.<a name=330:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Of course, I regret any extra labour caused the management of the Depot and I am sure Mr.<a name=330:16></a> Parker (his part of the work is practically all on the New York Readings) and myself with others who are helping with the work -- especially Mrs.<a name=330:17></a> Markham -- will seek grace and mercy from the Lord to be more accurate in our service.<a name=330:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the use of language, it is important to keep in mind that a thought may be expressed in several forms, all correct, and employed in ministering the things of God it is hardly seemly for us to strain ourselves to keep up with 'literary style;' thus if ordinary requirements are furnished in papers sent for publication this should suffice and there should be no changes made for the sake of style or embellishment.<a name=330:19></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Serious cases such as involved death were especially guarded.<a name=337:3></a> The Lord adduces the principle governing witness in the law in the Father's testimony and His own.<a name=337:4></a> The idea of quality in witness is stressed as in the Father, the Son and the Spirit; also in the twelve apostles, the six brothers which Peter took to Cornelius and his company, etc.<a name=337:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Where pressure of a moral character exists, the truth cannot be assured save in divine Persons and in those who have the Holy Spirit; and if a case is attended by personal feeling, reliability cannot be assured even among Christians except as the Lord is specially sought in the matter.<a name=337:6></a> Of course, we can count on a true judgment in the assembly, but this requires, as I said, dependence and prayer, for through natural influences our hearts as in judgment are almost certain to fail us.<a name=337:7></a> Thus the idea of adjuration is recognised in Scripture, and Paul calls on God to witness as to certain statements.<a name=337:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The testimony of the Cretan prophet had a local value, but it was confirmed by the apostle's authority.<a name=337:9></a> Paul quoted it as true.<a name=337:10></a> Certain statements written or spoken by men as such can be safely accepted as true in a general way; nature, cattle, etc.<a name=337:11></a>, etc.<a name=337:12></a>, bear testimony to the truth, otherwise as to general history and practical knowledge we should be at a great disadvantage; but when the moral element is involved conscience and the work of God in man by His Spirit are needed for testimony.<a name=337:13></a>

		The Lord is ever ready to help His people, especially in difficult cases requiring judgment in assembly; and usually, as in the interpretation of Scripture, the key is, as we are simple and transparent, nearby, and becomes visible.<a name=337:14></a> But if we are <i>looking</i> for evil, <i>seeking to prove</i> it, divine help fails us and we may become dark and otherwise damage ourselves.<a name=337:15></a>

		Beloved Brother, -- Your letter of February 22nd came a few days ago, and I thank you for it.<a name=338:4></a> I hope to reply more fully later, but I feel I must send a line at once relative to your information as to the collection.<a name=338:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mr.<a name=338:6></a> Ide wrote some months ago to the effect that certain changes had been adopted in some districts, and that it was alleged that these were in accord with what was done in New York.<a name=338:7></a> As Mr.<a name=338:8></a> Ide seemed pressed as to the matter, I cabled to say that no change had been made here.<a name=338:9></a> From twelve to fifteen years ago there has been no change in our procedure as to the collection.<a name=338:10></a> Earlier we had no special collections, but since we started them the amounts given by the saints for the furtherance of the Lord's interests have doubled or more.<a name=338:11></a> This marked advantage which we regarded as evidence of the Lord's approval and blessing is, I believe, general among the gatherings in America, where special collections are made, and, as far as I know, they are universal.<a name=338:12></a> The same is, I believe, true on your side and in Australasia and elsewhere.<a name=338:13></a> Just today I heard from Mr.<a name=338:14></a> Trevvett and Mr.<a name=338:15></a> Redfearn, also a letter came to Jim from A.<a name=338:16></a>M.<a name=338:17></a>H.<a name=338:18></a> relative to this matter.<a name=338:19></a> The information in all, including your letter, agrees.<a name=338:20></a> But I am in the dark as to where the idea of a change arose, and I need not say I should like to be informed.<a name=338:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		During many years past, the Lord has helped the saints as to assembly order and much result has accrued to God, also blessing generally, and more recently the collection entered into this, and, as I said, with marked blessing in the meetings.<a name=338:22></a> Surely, therefore, no change should be made without, at least, careful inquiry as to the basis of the previous adjustment, which resulted so well.<a name=338:23></a> According to what you and J.<a name=338:24></a>H.<a name=338:25></a>T.<a name=338:26></a> write, no scripture has been specially advanced, nor is any definite lead in the matter in evidence.<a name=338:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is clear, therefore, that the meetings which have inaugurated the change should be ready to give a reason, and in doing so, if they have light from God it will surely shine.<a name=338:28></a> Otherwise the adjustment already made, and which has been blessed should not be cancelled or discredited.<a name=338:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is more than this to be said.<a name=338:30></a> It is not that any real decisive issue need arise, but the exercise extending back many years as to assembly order, to which I have referred,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=339>[Page 339]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		involved much scriptural instruction.<a name=339:1></a> I am certain the Lord will cause this to stand, and this implies that the customs indicated in it should stand.<a name=339:2></a> But in referring to the instruction, I have the idea of <i>grade</i> in mind, and this particularly enters into the collections.<a name=339:3></a> The money or gifts contributed as seen in Scripture, have not always the same value.<a name=339:4></a> The apostle speaks of things sent to him by the Philippians as "an odour of sweet savour, an acceptable sacrifice, agreeable to God".<a name=339:5></a> This clearly has more value in heaven than equal money value contributed for ordinary expenses.<a name=339:6></a> The former is aimed at in the special collection.<a name=339:7></a> If the special collection works to "still more"(<a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#4:1">1 Thessalonians  4:1</a>), we are to judge of and approve the things that are <i>more</i> excellent.<a name=339:8></a> Love is the way of more "surpassing excellence", and it includes what <i>promotes giving</i> according to God.<a name=339:9></a> This pleases Him.<a name=339:10></a> The special collection leads to this end, which is abundantly proved among the brethren since they (the special collections) became generally adopted.<a name=339:11></a> <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#16">1 Corinthians  16</a>and <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#8">2 Corinthians  8</a>and 9 furnish undeniably a basis for special collections.<a name=339:12></a> Other scriptures could also be mentioned.<a name=339:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The idea of grade enters into almost all features of the truth, also corresponding faith and energy to reach and maintain the higher levels, and this includes the great thought of giving.<a name=339:14></a> Scripture contemplates stimulation in view of results, especially in the collection, as already remarked as to Paul's letters.<a name=339:15></a> As to <i>quality</i>, the types yield much as to grade, as evidenced in the metals employed in the tabernacle and temple.<a name=339:16></a> The stress on 'common level' in the information you sent as to the new movement militates against all this.<a name=339:17></a>

		to hear of the work of God among you, especially of the young men who are coming forward and taking part in His service.<a name=342:1></a> This seems a feature of the times, and the pressure on our brethren engaged in services for the various governments afford assurance that under the Lord's hand we may look for a deepening and continuance of it.<a name=342:2></a> I am grieved that our dear brother Joseph Boyt is so afflicted and I earnestly trust God will extend mercy to him as well as to his wife and family.<a name=342:3></a> The mention of Mr.<a name=342:4></a> Shorto and Mr.<a name=342:5></a> Betteney draws out the special affection of my wife and myself towards them and their families.<a name=342:6></a> We had heard that the Lord took to Himself Mr.<a name=342:7></a> Comber and Mr.<a name=342:8></a> Swindell.<a name=342:9></a>

		The matter of means for meeting physical needs among the saints was prominent from the outset and occasioned difficulty even in apostolic times as it does in our own.<a name=342:10></a> Evidence of this exists in the printed ministry; and I well remember when it was customary to pass round the receptacle for the collection at the <i>end</i> of the meeting.<a name=342:11></a> I recall, too, a public statement that in some meetings the box was not placed on the table at all.<a name=342:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But during the last fifty years -- at first through the ministries of Mr.<a name=342:13></a> Stoney and Mr.<a name=342:14></a> Raven -- the Lord gave light as to all the features of the service of God, including the collection.<a name=342:15></a> About fifteen years ago the latter obtained particular prominence.<a name=342:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There was no effort to treat the subject in an exhaustive way.<a name=342:17></a> The Lord seemed to stress the matter as it bore on <i>persons</i> -- meeting the need of those who served as sent by Him, and those regarded as poor.<a name=342:18></a> It seemed as if the Lord intended to appeal to <i>love</i> in His own, love for one another, working out towards those who serve Him in a special way and towards those who are poor.<a name=342:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards New York, this exercise led to the special collection, for there had been for many years much need in this city.<a name=342:20></a> In meeting it, which was difficult, and in furnishing help to the Lord's servants, which was comparatively small, it was forced upon us that in considering the need we should consider what we <i>possessed</i> rather than the amount of the monthly collections -- or rather the surplus of these after the fixed charges were met, for that was all we had to disburse.<a name=342:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we adopted the special collection, as intended, as seen in the letters to Corinth and elsewhere, to stimulate the saints to more giving -- in some sense in an equitable way.<a name=342:22></a>

		This, as already said, directs to what the saints <i>possess</i> rather than the amount of the collections.<a name=343:1></a> Of course, if the epistles and scriptures treating of this matter generally do not warrant stimulation, what we at New York have been practising as to the collection should be abandoned as wrong.<a name=343:2></a> But they <i>do</i> stress stimulation in this matter, and the Lord has blessed it in this city and, as facts show, generally.<a name=343:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As far as I can remember, the term 'budgeting' was not at first used as expressing the procedure as to the collection in New York; it was suggested to me by someone in England, and I accepted it as right or scriptural, but only as covering <i>immediate</i> need -- not for a whole month.<a name=343:4></a> But the meaning I attached to it particularly was that need should be met not simply according to the amount of the last month's collections, but, as already said, according to what the saints possessed when the facts were known -- that is, at the care meeting.<a name=343:5></a> It does not seem to me that budgeting for four weeks is in accord with scriptural principles.<a name=343:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards New York, as I said, we were affected by the urgency of meeting the need of persons, and we decided -- according to the scriptural principles cited above -- to have a collection on one Lord's Day of the month for this purpose.<a name=343:7></a> The other three -- or four -- collections we leave for known or fixed charges.<a name=343:8></a> Adjustments are made at the end of the month.<a name=343:9></a> Surpluses are added to the special collection.<a name=343:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will see that the only substantial change made in New York was the special collection.<a name=343:11></a> This, as I have shown, is undeniably warranted in Scripture.<a name=343:12></a> Many other gatherings adopted it -- some perhaps before us -- and, as I said, the Lord has blessed what has been done.<a name=343:13></a> That brethren in other quarters should decide to look into the matter further is, of course, unquestionable.<a name=343:14></a> It is clear, however, that the New Testament should be the basis of enquiry, especially Paul's ministry.<a name=343:15></a> He was minister of the assembly "according to the dispensation of God" towards the Gentiles.<a name=343:16></a> The subject should therefore be taken up from the point of view of his ministry.<a name=343:17></a> Scripture generally will, of course, fit and help, the Spirit being the blessed Medium and power of all enquiry and service.<a name=343:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		This is disquieting, as also budgeting for four weeks, for which no scriptural principle is adduced.<a name=344:1></a> This, in your letter, is a <i>key</i> point as negating what is special in 'giving and receiving' by placing all on the same level.<a name=344:2></a> Paul stresses persons and personal affection in connection with giving for levitical needs -- especially in Philippians.<a name=344:3></a> Epaphroditus shines in this peculiarly.<a name=344:4></a> He was much to the apostle, also to the Philippians, and he was their messenger and minister to his need.<a name=344:5></a> You mention someone in your meeting saying that the Philippians could not send Paul two collections in three weeks .<a name=344:6></a>.<a name=344:7></a>.<a name=344:8></a> with a monthly collection.<a name=344:9></a> But the saints are not limited to a monthly collection or any collection.<a name=344:10></a> This is, by extension, the gist of the whole matter.<a name=344:11></a> The assembly is greater than what it gives, than the collections made by it.<a name=344:12></a> But it is capable of being influenced by the ministry of the Spirit and if Scripture shows that this influence was applied effectively in apostolic times to stimulate giving it can surely be applied effectively now.<a name=344:13></a> This is evidenced in the special collection for the saints.<a name=344:14></a> To discredit what is urged by the apostle Paul to stimulate giving in a collection for the saints because it is applied to a collection for the saints in other circumstances, as is seen in your letter, is manifestly not right.<a name=344:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The prominence given to the assembly in the epistles to Corinth relative to the collection for the saints is striking.<a name=344:16></a> The glory of divine love working out in it, especially to those at a distance, is in mind.<a name=344:17></a> What the saints are to each other locally is not as much emphasised.<a name=344:18></a> The glory of Christ in its universal bearing entered into it.<a name=344:19></a> And one of the most remarkable features is the active personal part the apostle took in it.<a name=344:20></a> The ministration was intended to strengthen the bonds which <i>national</i> feeling tended to destroy.<a name=344:21></a> Surely this has a special voice at the present period in the testimony of God.<a name=344:22></a> It stimulates our universal outlook and liberality.<a name=344:23></a> The special collections have greatly helped to promote this result.<a name=344:24></a>

		The monies gathered by Joash and Nehemiah were for <i>things</i> needed for the house of God, but they were obtained on the principle of a special collection, so can money now needed for, say, a new meeting room, be obtained in a special way.<a name=345:19></a> In providing money for persons, according to the apostle's letter, the assembly acted in authority, and so it can act in liberty and authority in providing things for other purposes.<a name=345:20></a> The Philippians sent "things" to Paul by Epaphroditus: we cannot say definitely that they were provided from the regular collection.<a name=345:21></a> It is more likely that ardent hands like those of

		As to all giving being on the same level, I believe we must be on our guard as to the difference between spiritual sentiment and formal <i>scriptural teaching</i>.<a name=347:21></a> Clearly in a test we must be guided by the latter.<a name=347:22></a> As to the former, there has been much as to the 'box' that would not stand the scriptural test.<a name=347:23></a> In actual Pentecostal custom there is nothing said as to a collection.<a name=347:24></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The remarks in the Edinburgh Readings to which you refer were intended to convey that in my mind, while the Lord would bless money given by the saints for rent, etc.<a name=348:14></a>, He specially values what is given for the Levites and the poor -- on the one Lord's Day in the month devoted to them.<a name=348:15></a> I had in mind without naming it, what was at that time, as now, done in New York.<a name=348:16></a> The tenor of what follows on the page shows that I regarded giving for those who serve and to meet need as having special distinction.<a name=348:17></a> I should have stated the distinction more definitely, but the whole position is clearer to me now.<a name=348:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Scripture treating of what is given by the assembly says hardly anything of ordinary material requirements, whereas it says much of what is needed by persons -- the Levites and the poor -- and it is obvious that these facts should not be ignored in the circulation of love and the announcements formally made as to them.<a name=348:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It seems to me, therefore, that the habit in Sydney of budgeting and announcing ordinary fixed charges in each meeting must be unnecessarily cumbersome.<a name=348:20></a> The saints from week to week and month to month should be able to gauge them approximately and give accordingly.<a name=348:21></a> Assembly time is precious and should not be unduly taxed.<a name=348:22></a> At least, the omission of formal budgeting and announcing as to these items causes no disadvantages here.<a name=348:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Your remark on page 2 that the giving to Paul at Philippi is light that brothers do not give to the Levites, but the saints give collectively and intelligently is not clear to me.<a name=348:24></a> Paul directs, "Let him that is taught in the word communicate to him that teaches in all good things" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#6:6">Galatians  6:6</a>).<a name=348:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In your last paragraph on page 2 you enquire as to whether the working out of what is done should not be a matter of wisdom in each gathering in the light of local conditions.<a name=348:26></a> I would say that each gathering moving independently to any extent in any assembly responsibility is to be deprecated.<a name=348:27></a> I know there has been much of this on more counts than one, and perhaps no gathering is blameless, but I am sure the Lord

	<div class="paragraph">
		You rightly say on page 2 that love's obligation is to provide for the Levite and the poor -- always and not 'special'.<a name=349:5></a> But although it may be called love's obligation, it is not always met, and hence the need of stimulation.<a name=349:6></a> This is largely what the apostle stresses in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#8">2 Corinthians  8</a>and 9.<a name=349:7></a> This stimulation we find is needed in furthering our collections for the Levites and the poor.<a name=349:8></a> It will not do to say that this stimulation and speciality are needed only in such an emergency as is contemplated in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#8">2 Corinthians  8</a>and 9; they apply peculiarly when those who should be objects of our affection are involved.<a name=349:9></a> It would be a loss indeed if the precious special instruction and stimulation of Paul's letters to the Corinthians as to giving could be applied only to emergency cases such as the need in Great Britain to which you refer.<a name=349:10></a> It is intended to help the whole assembly as to its bounty in all times and circumstances.<a name=349:11></a>

		Beloved Brother, -- I regret delay in replying to your letter.<a name=351:29></a> But I was about to leave for Montreal when I sent you a copy of my letter to Manchester and I hoped to write when I returned, but many things came in to hinder.<a name=351:30></a>

		Mr.<a name=351:31></a> House had sent me a copy of his letter to you.<a name=351:32></a> I replied, but was unable to make a copy of what I wrote him.<a name=351:33></a> It is quite legitimate for Mr.<a name=351:34></a> House to quote from the Reading at Edinburgh, but the context shows that I stressed the special collection, and of course the matter has become clearer in my mind since that time.<a name=351:35></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The collection for the saints rightly fell into a place in the general adjustment in which the Lord has been helping His people for many years past.<a name=351:36></a> It came up particularly about the time of the revision of the hymnbook.<a name=351:37></a> Brethren from the Dominions, including Mr.<a name=351:38></a> House, Dr.<a name=351:39></a> Elliott and many others, were in England then.<a name=351:40></a> As far as I remember the idea of 'budgeting' came into the conversations allied with the special collection.<a name=351:41></a> And in looking back now these, I think,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=352>[Page 352]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		are the only features that were adopted, especially by the New York brethren.<a name=352:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What brethren generally had been accustomed to do in giving to the saints was left as it was.<a name=352:2></a> Budgeting was regarded as only meaning that brethren should be governed in giving to the saints according to what they <i>had</i> and not by the amount of the collection at any given time.<a name=352:3></a> This is, I believe, now generally accepted.<a name=352:4></a> But it was intended to have special emphasis when collections for the saints -- those who serve and the needy -- were in view.<a name=352:5></a> Thus in what has come up lately, as far as I see, the only issue is the special collection -- I mean issue as regards the change made fifteen years ago, which, as I said, is chiefly the special collection.<a name=352:6></a> What has been added in many places <i>lately</i> as to budgeting for a <i>month</i> and other items do not commend themselves to me.<a name=352:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What has exercised me as much as anything else that has arisen in connection with the collection is the importance of unity, or I might say catholicity among the saints.<a name=352:8></a> I believe the Lord will call attention to it.<a name=352:9></a> Although what was done to implement the giving of the saints at the time mentioned was done openly, I may say universally, yet many brethren in Australia and England have negated it considerably and added other methods without consulting their brethren.<a name=352:10></a> As far as I know the brethren in America knew nothing of it until last autumn.<a name=352:11></a> I heard of it then, but I had no idea that it had extended so far until early this year.<a name=352:12></a> I can well understand that some would from habit consider such a matter very secondary or optional, but no one who valued the idea of divine <i>directions</i> in 1 Corinthians, especially chapter 11, would regard it in this way.<a name=352:13></a> This will particularly be understood as it is borne in mind that many brethren, especially in large cities, have attached considerable importance to the special collection.<a name=352:14></a> In their minds Paul's letters on the subject are outstanding features of <i>his ministry</i>.<a name=352:15></a> The fact that Paul says so much about special giving for persons and hardly anything about local expenses is significant and should have correspondence in our care for obvious obligations.<a name=352:16></a> The procedure at Sydney seems very cumbersome.<a name=352:17></a> It seems right that what enters into ordinary assembly customs should be uniform, carrying an intelligible reason -- that there should be no <i>local</i> customs.<a name=352:18></a> Hence the apostle says, "We have no such custom, nor the assemblies of God".<a name=352:19></a> All this would work out in mutual confidence and

		I take the opportunity offered of adding a word to remind brethren that government is ordained by God, and, hence, its requirements should be regarded, not merely as the outcome of human wisdom or caprice, but as possessing divine authority.<a name=356:21></a> The Gentile monarchies are said to be "the four Spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth" (<a href="../bible/Zechariah.htm#6:5">Zechariah  6:5</a>).<a name=356:22></a> This agrees with the teaching of the New Testament which directs that a Christian should "be subject to the authorities that are above him.<a name=356:23></a> For there is no authority except from God; and those that exist are set up by God" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#13:1">Romans  13:1</a>).<a name=356:24></a>

		Thus in treating of the matter before us, we can see that abstractly, government exists in Canada and that it is of God.<a name=357:4></a> Who the agencies may be, who are employed in its administration is not the first thing, but rather that the abstract thought is discerned, and that, specifically, it applies to me.<a name=357:5></a> I do not seek to evade it even if it involves sacrifice.<a name=357:6></a> Whatever the requirement may be is my responsibility if made known through the means the government usually employs, and <i>ignorance of it is no excuse for my non-compliance</i>.<a name=357:7></a> If the regular leading officials of the government express a special wish that I should perform the said obligation, I am the more disposed to do so, conscientious considerations being fully met.<a name=357:8></a> I am indeed concerned about God's rights in the matter all the time, as, however objectionable to my feelings, it expresses His "good and acceptable and perfect will".<a name=357:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What discrepancies there may be between the <i>obvious</i> meaning of the requirement and the statements of subordinate officials, I proceed according to the <i>former</i>.<a name=357:10></a> If brethren are subject to the Lord, and to one another, they can surely arrive at a common judgment, and this will shut the enemy out, and prevent continuous variance and uncertainty.<a name=357:11></a>

		Next to London, I believe, Sydney has the greatest amount of 'care' as to physical matters, and we think of you all in this connection.<a name=359:5></a> I have no doubt you find, as we in New York do, that simplicity is one of the greatest helpers.<a name=359:6></a> I am sure you need a care meeting every week, and the same is true of Melbourne.<a name=359:7></a> We get along with one a month!<a name=359:8></a> Of course, we have a much smaller number -- now nine meetings instead of ten.<a name=359:9></a> But we find <i>much</i> can be left with each sub-division.<a name=359:10></a> All financial matters except the special collections are thus treated.<a name=359:11></a> Also all details as to persons seeking fellowship, including formal visitations, remain with the brothers in the respective meetings; also 'discipline' cases.<a name=359:12></a> But each case either for fellowship or discipline is placed under review at the general care meeting.<a name=359:13></a> We find confidence works well in all this and the Lord blesses it.<a name=359:14></a>

		As regards the <i>present</i> result reached in the minds of brethren generally, shorn of details, it seems to be just the special collection for the labourers and the needy, and that this special collection has <i>stimulation</i> in mind; otherwise it is one of the rest, occurring every four or five weeks.<a name=359:15></a> It is thus on the principle -- and hence scripturally warranted -- of <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#8">2 Corinthians  8</a>and 9.<a name=359:16></a>

		Referring to city readings, these are based on <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14:23">1 Corinthians  14:23</a> - 32.<a name=359:17></a> What helped several years ago as to them is the reference to facts as to the "hill of God" in <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#10">1 Samuel  10</a>.<a name=359:18></a> The term indicates the power of God.<a name=359:19></a> Such meetings, I understand, are intended to <i>augment</i> the weekly course of meetings and the greatest need for help is in the middle of the week.<a name=359:20></a>

		What you allude to as a 'delicate' matter -- marriages between persons in fellowship and those who are usually regarded as Christians in independent bodies, such as Open Brethren: this plague has to be faced wherever the fellowship of Christ's death is maintained.<a name=359:21></a> I note the number of unmarried

	<div class="paragraph">
		sisters breaking bread in Sydney.<a name=360:1></a> In view of the large number of gatherings there, this number is possibly not more than the average elsewhere.<a name=360:2></a> But at any rate, the disadvantages of unmarried life -- if there be any -- must be included in the terms of the covenant which fellowship involves.<a name=360:3></a> Some of these terms are at least implied in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#7:32">1 Corinthians  7:32</a> - 40.<a name=360:4></a> One item is that "he that marries does well; and he that marries not does better".<a name=360:5></a> This, I need not say, applies both to a brother or sister.<a name=360:6></a> The whole passage quoted should be read carefully.<a name=360:7></a> It places with divine wisdom and authority the unmarried sister in the advantage.<a name=360:8></a> No godly sister will make little of this, and if, in the ordering of the Lord, she has not obtained a husband, she will seek to find out how she can be 'better' single; or He may give her a husband if she sincerely waits on Him.<a name=360:9></a> But she will not compromise the fellowship in taking a husband who is not in it.<a name=360:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I know how much can be said as to this, but the Lord is looking to those who have the light He has caused to shine upon us, to maintain it by walking in it and contending for it in detail.<a name=360:11></a> In the revival in which we have part, men of God suffered in contending for the truth of <i>separation from evil</i>, and if sisters (or brothers) disregard this in marrying persons not in separation they are sinning and must accept the consequences.<a name=360:12></a> As to what judgment their brethren may form, this should be governed by all the facts -- their respective histories, etc.<a name=360:13></a> -- but the general principles governing fellowship must be maintained -- maintained as a <i>standard</i>.<a name=360:14></a> Of course, grace will be active, but to <i>lower</i> the divine standard, whatever it may be in any matter, is a crime against the truth.<a name=360:15></a> The <i>priest's eyes</i>, normally, will not fail to discriminate in each case.<a name=360:16></a> There will be a right and holy appraisement.<a name=360:17></a> The assembly, as formed according to God in truthful righteousness and holiness, can be trusted as to this.<a name=360:18></a> To depart from this and commit ourselves to written or unwritten forms of procedure will surely lead us to human levels as to doctrine and practice.<a name=360:19></a>

		The above remarks cover also what you say as to burials, whether of relatives or employers.<a name=360:20></a> There is something probably to be learned from the burials of Abraham and Isaac, and of the natural feelings or sentiments legitimately entering into the death of relatives, or other causes of sorrow experienced by them, and brethren divinely instructed ought, by the Lord's help, to be able to meet them.<a name=360:21></a> In truth, every case has its

		own features and, hence, divine help is needed in each, and instruction develops out of it as we are with the Lord about it.<a name=361:1></a> As I said, the brethren in Sydney -- with London and Melbourne -- have more to do with these matters than others, and I am sure that those elsewhere are sympathetic with this; but I am certain that adherence to the sound teaching of Scripture in dependence on the Holy Spirit is the only safe course for the saints today as it has always been.<a name=361:2></a>

		As to the holy subject you mention -- that of the Lord <i>worshipping</i> -- I cannot say that my thought as to it has changed since the time of the meeting at Barnet, which you refer to.<a name=361:4></a> I have no hesitation in saying that Scripture shows that He worshipped God.<a name=361:5></a> It belonged to the position in manhood that He had entered into.<a name=361:6></a> Worship is somewhat wide in its meaning, including singing in the midst of the assembly.<a name=361:7></a> But we should touch it, as it were, lightly, the same qualification applying to other things.<a name=361:8></a>

		Beloved Brother, -- I am in receipt of your letters of February 6th and 17th and enclosures and I thank you for sending information of the occasion of sorrow which has come upon the dear brethren in Argentina.<a name=363:15></a> I had earlier heard of it through Mr.<a name=363:16></a> John Holder.<a name=363:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The idea of <i>addition</i> being somewhat stressed in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>implies that it is a principle entering into the formation of assemblies.<a name=363:18></a> It necessitates history -- as to what was added <i>to</i> and what was added.<a name=363:19></a> Clearly the former has a certain precedence, morally and historically.<a name=363:20></a> To make application of the principle one would need to know something of the history of the work of God in Argentina, particularly the gatherings in Buenos Aires and Rosario.<a name=363:21></a> This should include the present moral condition of each in spiritual intelligence and weight generally.<a name=363:22></a> The knowledge of these facts would enable one to judge as before the Lord of the importance of the letters written by the brethren at Buenos Aires to the brethren at Don Bosco and the letter written by the brethren at Rosario to the brethren at Don Bosco.<a name=363:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		According to the principle of addition, it is clear that Buenos Aires has the first consideration.<a name=363:24></a> The brethren there are bound to seek to determine as before God whether those at Don Bosco, to whom they are nearest, are morally fit to be added to them and to all the assembly.<a name=363:25></a> Normally, their judgment as to this should be accepted by all the gatherings, for fellowship is general as well as local.<a name=363:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The fact, however, that some of those who should be included
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=364>[Page 364]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		in the gathering at Don Bosco object to being linked with them raises an issue and this must be considered by brethren further off.<a name=364:1></a> That is, we must revert to the principle of adding, and whether Buenos Aires has moral weight to judge as to whether Don Bosco is in a fit state to be added to Buenos Aires.<a name=364:2></a> As they have decided that it is not, and as others who ought to be heard believe it is, there is danger of cleavage, and hence scattering.<a name=364:3></a> Thus it is clear there ought to be patience and <i>waiting;</i> for we cannot afford to lose any of our brethren.<a name=364:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is what is advocated in the letter from Rosario, and the question is thus raised whether their advice is worthy of being bowed to.<a name=364:5></a> As I said, I cannot warrant this on account of ignorance of the history of the work in Argentina, but from what I do know, I believe it is.<a name=364:6></a> I deduce this from the generally known facts that there are three meetings in Rosario and that at least one of the brothers who signed the letter to Don Bosco is one of the first-fruits of Argentina -- Mr.<a name=364:7></a> A.<a name=364:8></a> E.<a name=364:9></a> Holder.<a name=364:10></a> I am assured that I am not mistaken as to this.<a name=364:11></a> I understand he is Mr.<a name=364:12></a> Holder, Snr.<a name=364:13></a>, with whom I became acquainted in England in earlier days and I greet him in the Lord through you, as you may see him.<a name=364:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having written above basically, I would now remark on the attitude of Mr.<a name=364:15></a> C------ , the brother and his wife and another sister, standing apart from the group in Don Bosco.<a name=364:16></a> According to the facts furnished, they give no valid reasons for their aloofness.<a name=364:17></a> Can they not see their way to change their minds and seek their brethren, joining with them in the professed fellowship of Christ's death?<a name=364:18></a> This obviously would go a long way in the adjustment all round that is so urgent.<a name=364:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards your 'immediate exercises', what I have said covers some of them, especially 'the necessary elements for a local gathering'.<a name=364:20></a> Conditions at Pentecost are intended to furnish these.<a name=364:21></a> It is true that a <i>metropolitan</i> assembly is in mind rather than <i>many</i>, but the main general assembly features are there, although further features were added by Paul.<a name=364:22></a> The epistles to Corinth indicate the characteristic features of the assemblies set up through Paul's ministry.<a name=364:23></a> They do not, however, provide for elders, but these are seen in the epistles to Timothy, Titus and elsewhere.<a name=364:24></a> Although there are no elders formally established now, care of the assemblies is an essential provision, and hence the setting up of one requires it to some extent.<a name=364:25></a> It is not a question of gift, but the spirit of

		As to enquiry No.<a name=365:2></a> 2, the usual and wise procedure is to acquaint nearby <i>meetings</i> of the intention to begin and <i>await their reply</i>.<a name=365:3></a> This is obviously right, according to the instruction of <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>, as pointed out above.<a name=365:4></a> Inquiries Nos.<a name=365:5></a> 3 and 4 contemplate rare occurrences.<a name=365:6></a> I should not attempt to answer them in the abstract.<a name=365:7></a> You do not furnish concrete cases.<a name=365:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In conclusion I would say that the situation in Argentina is not marked by wicked acts or attitudes and hence all concerned should wait -- Jacob says, "I wait for thy salvation, O Jehovah" -- and this will afford opportunity for counsel, visiting each other, etc.<a name=365:9></a>, etc.<a name=365:10></a> <i>Grace</i> is on the throne and love added will find a way out of the difficulty.<a name=365:11></a> It <i>never</i> fails.<a name=365:12></a>

		The other considerations as to the Depot -- that it should be a gathering place for brethren -- have been often advanced.<a name=369:7></a> It was understood at the outset that properly it is not a London institution; it is in principle <i>universal</i>.<a name=369:8></a> That the comparatively few of the brethren who visit the City could well be borne with as making use of the Depot is evident, but Stow Hill is not a local Tract Depot, but calculated to serve the saints in all lands, and this should not be overlooked.<a name=369:9></a>

		Beloved Brother, -- I have received your letters of February 24th, April 6th and April 13th.<a name=375:8></a> These are all most interesting and I thank you for them.<a name=375:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, I must allude to the following in your letter of February 24th: 'I am at a loss to understand your reference to a circular from England sent out as representing decisions reached as to procedure for our meetings here, for I have never heard or seen such a circular'.<a name=375:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to above quotation it seems a verbal error was made either in my letter or by you in copying it.<a name=375:11></a> In the typed copy I made of my letter the sentence from which you quote reads, 'I saw one circular from England sent out as representing decisions reached as to procedure for <i>four</i> (four underlined) meetings, with no reference to any others, or suggestion that the decisions should be followed'.<a name=375:12></a> You evidently read 'four meetings' as 'our meetings', as I said.<a name=375:13></a> This may be due to faulty handwriting on my part, but I certainly had no thought in my mind of connecting the circular mentioned with Australia.<a name=375:14></a> It was linked only with four meetings in England, and I mentioned it to show the extraordinary trend of the time.<a name=375:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That you were free to cause my letter to be read among the saints caused thankfulness, for I believe the error of the tendency of view as to mixed marriages which it deplored should be pressed upon all.<a name=375:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, as to the chief subject of your letter, the case of ------ I have read carefully your letter and I thank you for it, especially because of the evident care expended on it; including the further letter written on the 13th inst.<a name=375:17></a> With what you wrote I also read carefully considerable information sent by Mr.<a name=375:18></a> Alfred House during the recent winter.<a name=375:19></a> Mr.<a name=375:20></a> F.<a name=375:21></a> Willy also wrote quite recently.<a name=375:22></a> Thus, I believe, I am fairly well acquainted with the facts entering into the course of the enquiry.<a name=375:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have particularly noted letters written by ------ to Mr.<a name=375:24></a> John McAlpin in September 1943, and to Mr.<a name=375:25></a> Alfred House in December 1943.<a name=375:26></a> In these ------ professedly goes to the bottom of his history in relation to his part in the failure of ------ and other unrighteousnesses extending back to 1930.<a name=375:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Much of this unrighteousness was not disclosed at the time of the first assembly meeting, that of 1937; but it attached to ------ as before God and was not included in the judgment

		<a name=376>[Page 376]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		reached at that time by the brethren who met in assembly.<a name=376:1></a> Nor was it disclosed at the second assembly meeting, and hence the release and forgiveness extended by the brethren at that meeting cannot, in the light of the true facts be regarded as wholly valid.<a name=376:2></a> As there was a lack of transparency in ------ in the whole proceeding, although attended with great outward care and anxiety involving assembly authority and solemnity, the concealment of the financial matter of 1930 and other wrong conduct finally admitted, affected adversely the judgments rendered in both meetings.<a name=376:3></a> ------'s confessions in 1943, already referred to, confirm all this.<a name=376:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the responsibility of the brethren in Sydney there can be no doubt, in the light of the facts given above, that a grave failure of judgment in the assembly has occurred and that this should be owned before God.<a name=376:5></a> <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#4:13">Leviticus  4:13</a> - 21 is, I feel sure, applicable.<a name=376:6></a> The omission of use of New Testament available Scripture in the judgments rendered in the case increase the responsibility of the brethren in this.<a name=376:7></a> The disregard of the judgment of godly brethren such as Mr.<a name=376:8></a> F.<a name=376:9></a> Willy -- who from the outset was grieved by what had been done in the matter -- should have place in the consciences of the brethren.<a name=376:10></a> Our brother's absence could not invalidate this judgment, especially as he was "one of you".<a name=376:11></a> I have a copy of Mr.<a name=376:12></a> Willy's letter to you of May 1st 1937, expressing this judgment.<a name=376:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards Mr.<a name=376:14></a> Willy's disagreement with the first assembly judgment, I believe it is quite justified.<a name=376:15></a> ------'s admitted part in the business failure bears on this very strongly.<a name=376:16></a> His subsequent confession, to which I have referred and other facts, show that he was a shareholder in the business in which unrighteous transactions had taken place causing the exclusion from fellowship of the other partners.<a name=376:17></a> There was no evidence shown in the first assembly meeting that ------ was less guilty than the other partners: ------ and ------ .<a name=376:18></a> The <i>conscience</i> of the assembly could not forgive him; he was an active partner, buying and selling, and having full access to the books of the firm, and his subsequent confessions show that he was guilty with the other members, indeed consciously so.<a name=376:19></a> How then can it be shown that ------ should, as unforgiven, be allowed to remain in fellowship?<a name=376:20></a> The answer is obvious.<a name=376:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I may mention here that in a recent letter to Mr.<a name=376:22></a> Willy I pointed out that the scriptures of the New Testament, especially
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=377>[Page 377]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		in judicial matters, should have precedence as compared with those of the Old Testament, although all are inspired of God.<a name=377:1></a> It is clear that the authority of Christ and of His apostles should (according to the order indicated in the scriptures themselves) have the first place.<a name=377:2></a> Thus it is said the converts at Pentecost continued in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, and Peter and James in their ministry at Jerusalem, <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#15">Acts  15</a>, show the same order.<a name=377:3></a> I also called the attention of Mr.<a name=377:4></a> Willy to certain features of 2 Samuel and 1 Kings tending to confirm what he said in letters to you regarding the first assembly judgment.<a name=377:5></a>

		Beloved Brother, -- I am writing a line of enquiry: I have heard from Mr.<a name=379:8></a> Howell (Boston) of certain brothers arranging to meet at Kalispell in relation to an act or acts of discipline, and I am interested as to what is in mind, and if the meeting is at the instigation of the brethren local to Kalispell.<a name=379:9></a>

		I have not been to Kalispell as you know, but I have been near it en route from Seattle and I have been very interested in the prosperity of you all, and others have visited you there on the ground of fellowship, special meetings having been held there with Mr.<a name=379:10></a> Samuels and others -- all on the ground of universal fellowship.<a name=379:11></a> The meeting in Kalispell has had assembly status and I am counting on the Lord that this is not called in question.<a name=379:12></a>

		Beloved Brother, -- I have your letter of the 15th inst.<a name=379:19></a> and note your remark that Mr.<a name=379:20></a> Howell's letter and my telegram did not arrive until the special meetings at Kalispell had been held and that thus you could not have said anything as to the charges you had made against the two brothers -- Messrs.<a name=379:21></a> Geiken and Ivan Johnson.<a name=379:22></a> The fact you refer to does not alter the seriousness of the unproved charges you made against the two brothers.<a name=379:23></a> Whether before or after the meetings, the allegations were in your mind and made, and they remain unjudged and unwithdrawn -- at least as far as I know.<a name=379:24></a> You said they were 'two self-constituted priests .<a name=379:25></a>.<a name=379:26></a>.<a name=379:27></a> continually imposing threats' -- words that describe one of the worst sins in Christendom.<a name=379:28></a> I am not inferring that you mean to blacken your brothers in this way, but Scripture says, "by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned".<a name=379:29></a>

		<a name=380>[Page 380]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Besides the quotation I have made from your letter, there are others of a similar class also unproved.<a name=380:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another matter of grave importance is: whether the procedure at Kalispell as reported in letters, more especially by your own and the telegram signed by Messrs.<a name=380:2></a> Geiken and Hadley, is based on facts and assembly principles, as to whether these have not been seriously disregarded; and whether the unity professedly experienced in the local brethren was not the effect of conscience, but rather the outcome of external influence, so many from other parts being present; for instance, Mr.<a name=380:3></a> Ivan Johnson, said to be in agreement with the reinstatement in fellowship of ------ , and yet writing to me that he was unhappy about it, and Mr.<a name=380:4></a> Samuels, while writing a general letter in praise of the meetings, wrote me privately to express thankfulness for the telegram Mr.<a name=380:5></a> Howell and I sent you, saying that when he and others arrived the local brethren 'were in distress and in fear as to their losing all assembly status, or being disbanded and had thought that ------ had come there for that purpose'.<a name=380:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I now proceed to enlarge on above remarks, hoping to clarify and confirm what they are intended to convey.<a name=380:7></a> <i>First</i>, I cannot see how the local brethren (especially Messrs.<a name=380:8></a> Johnson and Geiken) could rightly attend the meetings at all if they were aware of your letter of July 16th to Mr.<a name=380:9></a> Howell -- that in which you made the charges against them -- unless indeed that you judged and withdrew them.<a name=380:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Second</i>.<a name=380:11></a> The statement in the telegram sent to me last Tuesday that the action of the so-called assembly meeting for repentance rendered invalid the previous withdrawal from Mr.<a name=380:12></a> Johnson is not established by fact nor by assembly principle.<a name=380:13></a> Mr.<a name=380:14></a> Robert Smith who has had the status of a local brother at Kalispell for a long time does not agree with reinstatement of ------ , and he says that Ivan Johnson and Mylo Geiken were surprised that it took place.<a name=380:15></a> He also says their weakness and lack of intelligence caused them to give way to your exercises in which you were helped by Mr.<a name=380:16></a> R------ .<a name=380:17></a> As I already mentioned, Ivan Johnson wrote to me that he did not agree with ------'s reinstatement.<a name=380:18></a> Mr.<a name=380:19></a> Smith says ------ was withdrawn from because of his sympathy with his daughters who were rightly withdrawn from as worldly, and even now they are worse and speak against the brethren and call them names; and that their father blames the brethren for their

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=381>[Page 381]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		worldliness!<a name=381:1></a> Thus the testimony is that the three leading brothers in Kalispell are at heart and really openly out of agreement with the readmission to fellowship of ------ , and the consequent invalidity of the previous action of withdrawal.<a name=381:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Third</i>.<a name=381:3></a> The attitude taken that assembly disciplinary actions involving the same person can be invalidated and validated almost at the same time without careful enquiry is humbling.<a name=381:4></a> It is a travesty of assembly order, dignity and authority.<a name=381:5></a> This is especially so when accompanied by false statements as to some who are involved, and when those discredited by the invalidation have testimony rendered by competent persons that they are godly and have sought in their measure to serve the Lord in what is now impugned.<a name=381:6></a> The fact that they through weakness and want of understanding have unwillingly given assent to what they had thought wrong does not alter this.<a name=381:7></a> As already said, Ivan Johnson did not really give assent, as his letter to me proves.<a name=381:8></a> And Robert Smith did not and does not now give assent to what was done.<a name=381:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Fourth</i>.<a name=381:10></a> I know it is assumed that 'our general assembly meeting for repentance' adjusted what was needed in this respect.<a name=381:11></a> But is such an assembly meeting prescribed for Christians?<a name=381:12></a> I certainly do not know of it.<a name=381:13></a> What corresponds is in the Old Testament but not in the New.<a name=381:14></a> Repentance and confession of sins involve the <i>individual</i> side of the truth.<a name=381:15></a> The general principle would be in Peter's word in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>, "Repent and be baptised each one of you".<a name=381:16></a> I know of no example in the New Testament of an assembly convened for collective confession.<a name=381:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe the Lord is stressing the assembly, both in its composition and function, and I am sure He resents anything that discredits it.<a name=381:18></a> When the Corinthians were misbehaving in relation to the Supper he says, "When ye come therefore together into one place, it is not to eat the Lord's supper", and "do ye despise the assembly of God?<a name=381:19></a>" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:20">1 Corinthians  11:20</a>, 22).<a name=381:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards the situation at Kalispell, evidence is well confirmed that for some years active assembly material was there.<a name=381:21></a> L.<a name=381:22></a>E.<a name=381:23></a>S.<a name=381:24></a> says that the brothers who were leading were 'basically right'.<a name=381:25></a> From my own observation I conclude that this is true and it is confirmed by reliable brethren, especially by Mr.<a name=381:26></a> Howell and several others.<a name=381:27></a> Mr.<a name=381:28></a> Howell furnished me with correspondence to this effect covering a considerable period.<a name=381:29></a> Mr.<a name=381:30></a> R.<a name=381:31></a> Smith who has been in and out among them for a

	<div class="paragraph">
		good while affords the same testimony.<a name=382:1></a> It seems to me, therefore, that there should not have been any suggestion or show of starting on a clean sheet, but rather of making the most of what was there, confirming where possible what had been done, according to what the apostle said to the Corinthians, "even as ye are unleavened".<a name=382:2></a> Abstract facts and statements of this kind are always needed in a condition such as Kalispell presented.<a name=382:3></a> There is no thought in the Corinthian epistles of cancelling what was there, but of utilising all that was of God, although very grievous conditions existed.<a name=382:4></a> There is evidence, as I said, that assembly conditions existed at Kalispell and the Lord is jealous of these and resents disregard of them.<a name=382:5></a>

		I have a cable from Mr.<a name=383:4></a> Hayward on behalf of the brethren, inviting me to New Zealand, and I have had to reply that I could not undertake such a journey during the coming year.<a name=383:5></a> Of course, if God opens up the way in the Fall of next year we may be free to consider the matter, and of course, I shall let Mr.<a name=383:6></a> Hayward know.<a name=383:7></a> I have committed myself for meetings in Belfast next April and in London in the middle of July, God willing, and of course these commitments would stand in the way of any visit to Australasia in the meantime.<a name=383:8></a> The brethren in Australia have also invited me to visit them there, Messrs.<a name=383:9></a> Willy and House having joined in the invitation on behalf of the brethren.<a name=383:10></a> I need not say that my wife and I would greatly enjoy seeing the dear brethren in your part of the world, and shall not fail to take advantage of the first opportunity of doing so.<a name=383:11></a>

		I am not very clear as to remarks concerning Lord's Day afternoon and midweek meetings, but I have no doubt all the facts will become clearer to me as I hear from others.<a name=383:13></a> I would say, however, that I believe special meetings for ministry afford greater advantage in the middle of the week than on Lord's Day.<a name=383:14></a> Generally the Lord's Days afford more blessing and encouragement without such meetings, and the facts relative to the first day of the week should make this plain.<a name=383:15></a>

		I find considerable encouragement in America since our arrival at San Francisco.<a name=399:15></a> I remained in the West Coast for a short time as the Lord had taken my brother, who lived in Los Angeles, to Himself, and I had the great advantage of being present in Los Angeles in time to have part in his burial.<a name=399:16></a> He was eighty-six years when the Lord took him, and there was a sense of support throughout at the burial.<a name=399:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Mr.<a name=413:1></a> James Taylor was born January 6th, 1870, at Coolaney, near Sligo, Ireland, and at the age of fourteen left for Paisley, where he served his apprenticeship.<a name=413:2></a> He came into fellowship at Paisley, having been helped to commit himself to the Lord through Mr.<a name=413:3></a> John Coulter of Sligo.<a name=413:4></a> He came to St.<a name=413:5></a> John, Newfoundland, in 1888, and to New York in 1889, where he made his home for over sixty years.<a name=413:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The following year, 1890, most of the meeting in New York was lost through a brother being allowed into fellowship (although this was opposed by Mr.<a name=413:7></a> Taylor), who undermined the saints as to Mr.<a name=413:8></a> F.<a name=413:9></a> E.<a name=413:10></a> Raven.<a name=413:11></a> The bitter feelings of those opposed to Mr.<a name=413:12></a> Raven were shown in their unseemly conduct at the Lord's supper, when Mr.<a name=413:13></a> Taylor and those in accord with Mr.<a name=413:14></a> Raven left and broke bread in another place.<a name=413:15></a> It was at this critical time that these brethren fasted, actually abstaining from food.<a name=413:16></a> Mr.<a name=413:17></a> Taylor made a vow to the Lord at that time also to commit himself fully to His interests and be responsible for them in New York.<a name=413:18></a> He received much help from Mr.<a name=413:19></a> Raven, on the latter's two visits to America, and also when he attended the Quemerford meetings.<a name=413:20></a> Mr.<a name=413:21></a> Joseph Revell, who ministered much throughout America, was also a great help to him.<a name=413:22></a>

		What generally became known as the 'Chicago Notes' was the subject of Mr.<a name=413:23></a> Taylor's first conflict as to his ministry.<a name=413:24></a> These were notes of meetings held in Chicago, Illinois, December, 1904, and January, 1905, the subject taken up being the House of God and the gospel (see Volume 1).<a name=413:25></a> What was ministered as to the Spirit and the assembly became the subject of much criticism, but this ministry was shown to be the truth from Scripture and the Lord made it to stand.<a name=413:26></a> The letter to 'Brethren in America' from T.<a name=413:27></a>H.<a name=413:28></a>R.<a name=413:29></a> said that the root of the 'Minneapolis trouble' had now come to light; it was, the letter stated, the wrong teaching promulgated by Mr.<a name=413:30></a> Taylor in Chicago (the Chicago Notes, Volume 1).<a name=413:31></a> Letters of September 1st and December 29th, 1903, of the collection give the account of the 'Minneapolis trouble'.<a name=413:32></a> T.<a name=413:33></a>H.<a name=413:34></a>R.<a name=413:35></a> withdrew the letter he wrote to the 'Brethren in America'.<a name=413:36></a> When the Glanton matter arose (1908), the supporters of Glanton's action referred to Mr.<a name=413:37></a> Taylor's ministry at Chicago,

		The personal glory of the Holy Spirit, and the place He has in the economy had been much in the mind of our beloved brother from the beginning of the century (see Volume 2, New Series, page 27).<a name=416:1></a> While he had held to the truth of <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21:17">Numbers  21:17</a> being objective, yet he had ministered that the Spirit should not be prayed to, as had Mr.<a name=416:2></a> J.<a name=416:3></a> N.<a name=416:4></a> Darby.<a name=416:5></a> However, Mr.<a name=416:6></a> Darby had written, 'The Holy Spirit is a divine Person and in the unity of the Godhead adored and worshipped', in 1870 (Letters, Volume 2, page 86), and found no fault with those who called the Holy Spirit Lord.<a name=416:7></a> In his Collected Writings, he says that Eliezer (type of the Spirit) 'talks to Rebecca .<a name=416:8></a>.<a name=416:9></a>.<a name=416:10></a> .<a name=416:11></a> precious conversation for the soul that needs to be encouraged' (Volume 16, page 195).<a name=416:12></a> Mr.<a name=416:13></a> Taylor said in a reading in New York on March 10th, 1942, as to <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21:17">Numbers  21:17</a>, 18, 'The lawgiver is still there, because the principle of rule must be always present.<a name=416:14></a> His name is not mentioned.<a name=416:15></a> It is the lawgiver.<a name=416:16></a> But the singing is not to him, but to the well, the Spirit of God.<a name=416:17></a> Miriam .<a name=416:18></a>.<a name=416:19></a>.<a name=416:20></a> dies; her voice is now silent.<a name=416:21></a> It is another voice now -- sing to the Spirit'.<a name=416:22></a> At the meetings in Toronto in 1942 (Volume 162), 'The Spirit viewed objectively in the book of the Acts' was taken up.<a name=416:23></a> Five years later at Newcastle, N.<a name=416:24></a>S.<a name=416:25></a>W.<a name=416:26></a> (1947) he brought forward the rightness of addressing the Spirit, not only singing to Him, but addressing Him in assembly service.<a name=416:27></a> On his return to New York in February, 1948, our beloved brother, using great wisdom and levitical skill, did not immediately press this important matter, but addressing the Spirit was referred to in nearly every City Reading, and service to Him publicly in the meetings here began toward the end of 1948.<a name=416:28></a> At Detroit, September 1st, 1948 (Volume 184) he said that the Spirit, being God, could be worshipped, prayed to, and spoken to.<a name=416:29></a> As we finished the book of Hebrews in the New York City Readings at the end of 1948, an allusion was made to the Spirit in Ezekiel.<a name=416:30></a> Mr.<a name=416:31></a> Taylor enlarged on this, saying that he had been going through that prophet tracing references to the Spirit and had become so interested that he started over again even more carefully scrutinising every passage that referred to the Spirit, and recommending that the brethren do the same.<a name=416:32></a> "Say to the wind" (the Spirit), <a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#37:9">Ezekiel  37:9</a>, bore weightily with our beloved brother in his conclusions as to this transcendingly important and holy matter.<a name=416:33></a> There was a certain reluctance with some to accept what Mr.<a name=416:34></a> Taylor was
