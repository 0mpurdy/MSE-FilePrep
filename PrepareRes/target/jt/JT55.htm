		J.T.<a name=1:2></a> Life, which is a great and very wide thought, has been selected as the subject for these readings.<a name=1:3></a> I think we have observed that the truth opens up to us more freely as we treat it in its immediate application to ourselves to meet current need.<a name=1:4></a> So it was thought that we might begin with life as spoken of in the Scriptures in relation to the last days, which are called "difficult times" in <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#3:1">2 Timothy  3:1</a>.<a name=1:5></a> The epistle was written to a young man, taken up in the service and qualified for it, and points to the continuance of the testimony.<a name=1:6></a> In ministering, Timothy was to have in mind at least two generations after himself, chapter 2: 2.<a name=1:7></a> Paul enjoined him to pass on to others what he had heard from him.<a name=1:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In view of what we have been engaged with during the past series of meetings, that is, "Wells and Springs", it is thought that the subject of life should be looked at; although it has been included, in some measure, in the previous inquiry, it is thought that the latter needs supplementing by a review of life in a more general way.<a name=1:9></a> The bearing of prophetic ministry in relation to it is also in mind; that is why the passage in Ezekiel was proposed.<a name=1:10></a> It contemplates life in a complete result.<a name=1:11></a> In that passage we have persons constituted from a condition of dry bones into full manhood.<a name=1:12></a> "The whole house of Israel" is seen there -- "an exceeding great army".<a name=1:13></a> Clearly, conflict is in mind.<a name=1:14></a>

		J.T.<a name=2:1></a> It is God anticipating need that would arise.<a name=2:2></a> A promise is usually to meet a need.<a name=2:3></a> This promise was made long before, but it becomes effective as the need exists.<a name=2:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.N.<a name=2:5></a>W.<a name=2:6></a> Does it differ from the promise of eternal life which is mentioned in Titus?<a name=2:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:8></a> I think it is the same thing.<a name=2:9></a> It is called "life" here in both passages read.<a name=2:10></a> In verse 1, it is the "promise of <i>life</i>", and in verse 10, "<i>life</i> and incorruptibility".<a name=2:11></a> Life is more operative.<a name=2:12></a> Eternal life is more a fixed thought and is over against death.<a name=2:13></a> Eternal life covers eternity, but what is needed now is life.<a name=2:14></a> Timothy, however, is told in the first letter to him to "lay hold of eternal life" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#6:12">1 Timothy  6:12</a>), and believers who are rich are enjoined to "lay hold of what is really life" (verse 19).<a name=2:15></a> The latter is in contrast to what may be acquired of this world's things by money.<a name=2:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.P.<a name=2:17></a>T.<a name=2:18></a> Is life, then, an active thought?<a name=2:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:20></a> It is quite obviously so.<a name=2:21></a> In the whole universe, life in various forms is active all the time; and this is also true of spiritual life.<a name=2:22></a> But eternal life is a fixed thought with a very wide bearing.<a name=2:23></a> It is connected with the earth where death is.<a name=2:24></a> The word 'eternal' is in contrast to what is temporal.<a name=2:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.B.<a name=2:26></a>P.<a name=2:27></a> The greatest movements of the physical universe -- the rotations of the heavenly bodies -- do not represent life, do they?<a name=2:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:29></a> Only in a typical sense.<a name=2:30></a> Of course, God lives and angels live; but eternal life is for men only.<a name=2:31></a> In <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>, life is seen on the third day: vegetable life.<a name=2:32></a> The heavenly bodies are in view of that, to <i>promote</i> it.<a name=2:33></a> Life for men is connected with the earth.<a name=2:34></a> So, "In him was life, and the life was the light of men" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:4">John  1:4</a>), would contemplate what was down here, not what was in heaven.<a name=2:35></a> Men were on earth.<a name=2:36></a> The life that was in Christ was for men only.<a name=2:37></a>

		J.T.<a name=3:15></a> Yes; they also regulate.<a name=3:16></a> They are for times and seasons.<a name=3:17></a> So, in a later day it is said, "Henceforth, all the days of the earth, seed time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night, shall not cease", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#8:22">Genesis  8:22</a>.<a name=3:18></a> Heaven regulates; and it affords light, heat and rain which are essential to life on the earth.<a name=3:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:10></a> Yes; what is promised, as we have said, is to meet a need or desire in us, but purpose is what God effects for Himself.<a name=4:11></a> But it is very touching that God considers for us, the promise of life being the outcome of this.<a name=4:12></a> It is a very great blessing and absolutely essential to us now and for ever.<a name=4:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:18></a> Yes.<a name=4:19></a> God said to the serpent that the woman's seed would crush his head.<a name=4:20></a> There would be a need in humanity for that.<a name=4:21></a> Clearly Adam named the woman Eve in the light of this pronouncement.<a name=4:22></a> Eve was the mother of all living, hence the meaning of the name her husband gave her.<a name=4:23></a> <i>Eve</i> is a different word from <i>woman</i> in chapter 2.<a name=4:24></a> Eve, meaning <i>life</i>, is the suggestion of a promise, because sin had come in, and death had been pronounced as a judgment on man.<a name=4:25></a> Doubtless God was working with Adam and hence, in some sense, he was in the light of life notwithstanding the judgment of death upon him.<a name=4:26></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:30></a> How He made the promise of life formally is a question, but He made it "before the ages of time".<a name=4:31></a> It is now "in Christ Jesus", <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1:1">2 Timothy  1:1</a>.<a name=4:32></a> It is a certainty now; it has taken form and is secured in Man.<a name=4:33></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		W.F.<a name=5:4></a>K.<a name=5:5></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#10">John  10</a>, He says, "I am come that they might have life, and might have it abundantly" (verse 10).<a name=5:6></a> Is the need met there?<a name=5:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:12></a> Yes; it is for ourselves now; the young people especially.<a name=5:13></a> It is a fixed matter.<a name=5:14></a> Adam could not see it in this way, but he certainly had light in his soul when he said, Eve.<a name=5:15></a> The idea of life came into his mind: the mother of all living.<a name=5:16></a> But now the thing is not only promised, but it has actually taken form.<a name=5:17></a> You can see it in Christ.<a name=5:18></a> It has taken definite form, and is available to us as a promise.<a name=5:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.B.<a name=5:20></a>P.<a name=5:21></a> Is that what Peter had in mind when he spoke of the Originator of life; <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#3">Acts  3</a>?<a name=5:22></a> Mr.<a name=5:23></a> Darby's footnote there is helpful in relation to it: 'He began and finished the whole course'.<a name=5:24></a> He set it forth and completed it.<a name=5:25></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:26></a> Yes.<a name=5:27></a> A man may originate a thing, but to complete the idea he must make it function.<a name=5:28></a> So the Lord Jesus originated life, being God, and He exemplified it.<a name=5:29></a> He says, "He that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life", <a href="../bible/John.htm#8:12">John  8:12</a>.<a name=5:30></a>

		J.T.<a name=53:1></a> It will be observed that the passages read speak of life somewhat in relation to those who serve; those who carry on the ministry; running on from the idea of odour in ministry.<a name=53:2></a> In chapter 5 we see the final effect of life, ".<a name=53:3></a>.<a name=53:4></a>.<a name=53:5></a> that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life" (verse 4).<a name=53:6></a> It is thought that, first, we might connect our subject with the collective position as at Corinth.<a name=53:7></a> It includes occasions such as we are presently engaged in, particularly as marked by life operating in those who carry on the ministry.<a name=53:8></a> It is carried out in mortal bodies but culminates in this remarkable statement, "while yet we do not wish to be unclothed, but clothed, that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life".<a name=53:9></a> Then, the victorious characteristics of the great truth of life.<a name=53:10></a> Chapter 15 of the first epistle enlarges on this subject, involving the resurrection of the saints' bodies; persons who have actually died.<a name=53:11></a> But what is contemplated here is rather being "clothed"; mortality being thus swallowed up by life.<a name=53:12></a> This refers to those who are alive in their mortal bodies when the Lord comes.<a name=53:13></a> We can hardly speak of all this with consistency save as we are characterised in some degree by life in our services.<a name=53:14></a>

		J.T.<a name=183:1></a> These scriptures treat of what is against Christ in such intensity as to be named antichrist, a term that is not very often used in Scripture; only, indeed, in John's epistles, bearing on the character of the opposition as against christianity founded in the revelation of God in Christ -- the Father and the Son.<a name=183:2></a> There were many antichrists, as John says here, "Even now there have come many antichrists" (verse 18), which would show that the opposition was widespread; and then it was intimated that the special character of the opposition was the denial of Jesus Christ come in flesh.<a name=183:3></a> Ultimately, however, the antichrist, as remarked, denies the Father and the Son; that is, he denies christianity.<a name=183:4></a>

		Then we have the <i>power</i> of antichrist in chapter 4.<a name=183:5></a> It is a question of the kind of spirit that had to be discerned; "And this is that power of the antichrist, of which ye have heard that it comes, and now it is already in the world" (verse 3).<a name=183:6></a> Then again there is <i>deception</i>, "For many deceivers have gone out into the world, they who do not confess Jesus Christ coming in flesh -- this is the deceiver and the antichrist", <a href="../bible/2John.htm#7">2 John  7</a>.<a name=183:7></a> I thought it would be helpful to all of us to scan this section of Scripture and to see how the evil spoken of is to be met by the unction, as stated, "And <i>ye</i> have the unction from the holy one, and ye know all things" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:20">1 John  2:20</a>), meaning that we are capable of meeting all this opposition and deception as having the Spirit.<a name=183:8></a>

		The second epistle of John confirms what we are saying, but it is remarkable that it is addressed to a lady, as it says, "The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom <i>I</i> love in truth, and not <i>I</i> only but also all who have known the truth, for the truth's sake which abides in us and shall be with us to eternity.<a name=204:1></a> Grace shall be with you, mercy, peace from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love" (verses 1 - 3).<a name=204:2></a> You will notice how John brings in the economy into which divine Persons have come.<a name=204:3></a> This sister was coming into the good of it.<a name=204:4></a> Then he says, "I rejoiced greatly that I have found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received commandment from the Father.<a name=204:5></a> And now I beseech thee, lady, not as writing to thee a new commandment, but that which we have had from the beginning, that we should love one another.<a name=204:6></a> And this is love, that we should walk according to his commandments.<a name=204:7></a> This is the commandment, according as ye have heard from the beginning, that ye might walk in it.<a name=204:8></a> For many deceivers have gone out into the world, they who do not confess Jesus Christ coming in flesh -- this is the deceiver and the antichrist" (verses 4 - 7).<a name=204:9></a> There he is viewed as active; it is not a static position; it is not simply a person sitting down; it is his action.<a name=204:10></a> I think John's gospel has that in mind.<a name=204:11></a> He presents the Lord as walking; John the baptist saw Him walking, coming to him, and he named Him the Lamb of God: "Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world", chapter 1: 29.<a name=204:12></a> There is something to impress one in the manner or gait of the Person.<a name=204:13></a> That is, He is coming to die -- a most wonderful fact to dwell upon.<a name=204:14></a> The movements of such a Person coming to die are most affecting.<a name=204:15></a> He talked about those movements on the mount with Moses and Elias.<a name=204:16></a> So that John sees the Lord walking; it does not say where He was going, but as He walked.<a name=204:17></a> John said, "Behold the

		Lamb of God".<a name=205:1></a> So the lady mentioned in this epistle, no doubt represents the idea of the assembly.<a name=205:2></a> The assembly is charmed with the movements of Christ, as the Song of Songs suggests.<a name=205:3></a> How charmed the feminine side is with the movements of Christ!<a name=205:4></a> That is, you are drawn to Him like the woman of <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7">Luke  7</a>.<a name=205:5></a> I think His feet are directly mentioned seven times there -- the feet of Jesus.<a name=205:6></a> She is attracted by those feet.<a name=205:7></a> It is the incoming of Christ; those feet brought Him to the woman.<a name=205:8></a>

		J.T.<a name=228:2></a> It is generally known that we are thinking of continuing the subject of life.<a name=228:3></a> We read from the first epistle of John at our last reading, finishing with chapter 3.<a name=228:4></a> It is thought that we should read the last chapter tonight.<a name=228:5></a> This scripture is intended to be confirmatory of what we have had in the ten previous readings on this subject.<a name=228:6></a> The epistles are usually intended to meet certain local conditions, but this epistle is not written to a local assembly.<a name=228:7></a> It is general, but specific as to its principle subject; it mainly deals with life, and it is characterised by the presentation of <i>subjective</i> truth.<a name=228:8></a> This is especially seen in this chapter: "He that believes on the Son of God has the witness in himself" (verse 10).<a name=228:9></a> This verse reminds us that in the possession of the Spirit, we have the means in ourselves of confirmation of what God presents to us.<a name=228:10></a> So that there should be some confirmation in most of us as to this matter of life, and by extension, as to every matter.<a name=228:11></a> There is considerable declension and deflection -- considerable turning aside from the truth -- and the secret is that there is not confirmation of it in our souls.<a name=228:12></a> The Lord, when there was a drifting away from Him, challenged His disciples, saying, "Will <i>ye</i> also go away?<a name=228:13></a>" <a href="../bible/John.htm#6:67">John  6:67</a>.<a name=228:14></a> The reply of Peter was, "Lord, to whom shall we go?<a name=228:15></a> thou hast words of life eternal".<a name=228:16></a> That is what we have been seeking to understand in the recent series of meetings, involving whether we really have the witness in ourselves.<a name=228:17></a> If we have, how can we go away?<a name=228:18></a> Peter adds, "We have believed and known that <i>thou</i> art the holy one of God" (verse 69).<a name=228:19></a>

		It seems, therefore, that this chapter has a fitting place in the resumption of our subject so that we might proceed with some measure of understanding and assurance, that we may be learners or gainers in what comes before us.<a name=229:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I thought that we might take the chapter as it is, first as to victory -- how victory is accorded to us as begotten of God.<a name=229:2></a> The chapter begins, "Every one that believes that Jesus is the Christ is begotten of God; and every one that loves him that has begotten loves also him that is begotten of him.<a name=229:3></a> Hereby know we that we love the children of God, when we love God and keep his commandments.<a name=229:4></a> For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments" (verses 1 - 3).<a name=229:5></a> The defect in many, I believe, is the want of understanding of having been begotten of God and how it works towards God and towards the brethren, so that there is a balanced love amongst us; that is, we love God by whom we are begotten, and we love the brethren -- those who are also begotten of Him.<a name=229:6></a> The idea is that we are all begotten of God.<a name=229:7></a> It is proved in different ways.<a name=229:8></a> It says, in verse 1, "Every one that believes that Jesus is the Christ is begotten of God".<a name=229:9></a> That is not simply that he believes something because he has read it, but he is begotten of God; and not simply that he believes on the Lord Jesus, but he believes that <i>He is the Christ</i>.<a name=229:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=230:10></a> I think the Lord would help us to look at what this paragraph presents.<a name=230:11></a> Believing that Jesus is the Christ would mean that He is the Messiah, if a Jew were in question.<a name=230:12></a> We are not Jews, but gentile believers, but the idea of the Christ applies to us as it did to them; that is, He is the One whom God has taken on as effecting all His thoughts and purposes.<a name=230:13></a> Then, as believing that He is the Son of God, the victory is gained: "Who is he that gets the victory over the world, but he that believes that Jesus is the Son of God?<a name=230:14></a>" This implies another world.<a name=230:15></a> The Christ takes up all that refers to this world -- the gospel, prophecy, etc.<a name=230:16></a> -- but the Son of God brings in another world.<a name=230:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=252:14></a> There is a certain correspondence between his address to the Lord and the message that the Lord had sent through Mary to the disciples: ".<a name=252:15></a>.<a name=252:16></a>.<a name=252:17></a> my Father and your Father, .<a name=252:18></a>.<a name=252:19></a>.<a name=252:20></a> my God and your God", chapter 20: 17.<a name=252:21></a> This indicates a circle having the greatest and most intimate family relation with God.<a name=252:22></a> In Ephesians, Paul bows his knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom every family in the heavens and on earth is named; and the first of these families is clearly in mind in the message through Mary, in which the Lord says to His brethren, "I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God".<a name=252:23></a> Now in what Thomas says, he has missed that.<a name=252:24></a> He was not with the other disciples when the message came.<a name=252:25></a> He represents the Jews coming in later, but nevertheless with light as to Christ; but "my God" comes after "my Lord".<a name=252:26></a> The latter would be a <i>kingdom</i> reference.<a name=252:27></a> Instead of "my Father" in the inner circle, it is "my Lord" and then "my God".<a name=252:28></a> The light that comes to Thomas is by the sign seen in the Lord's body; that is, he is on lower ground.<a name=252:29></a> It is not a revelation that he gets, but what is evident in the Lord personally; it is

		J.T.<a name=253:11></a> Just so; the disciples were again within, but evidently on a lower level, for there was an unbelieving one among them, who necessarily detracted from the occasion.<a name=253:12></a> Any characteristic unbeliever here today detracts from this occasion.<a name=253:13></a> But Thomas' unbelief was dispelled by the sign afforded by what was in the Lord's own Person.<a name=253:14></a>

		J.T.<a name=269:1></a> What is to be observed as regards <a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>is that it presents eternal life in relation to the <i>gospel</i>.<a name=269:2></a> I do not think we have looked at it in a definite way from that point of view, but it is perhaps the most important scripture that treats of eternal life in that relation; that is, the verses read in that chapter.<a name=269:3></a> The subject is presented from the divine side, running on generally to the end of the chapter.<a name=269:4></a> Then chapter 4 brings in the Spirit, as typified in the living water -- the power to make the life effective.<a name=269:5></a> We can see, therefore, the connection with <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21">Numbers  21</a>, which treats typically of sin in man (the source of it being in view -- the bite of the serpent pointing to that) and how it is met in the likeness of the serpent, the fiery serpent lifted up.<a name=269:6></a> Then the power of the Spirit is seen typically in the water springing up, which corresponds to <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>.<a name=269:7></a> The thought of the Spirit is enlarged upon in the type as coming in through the digging by the princes under the direction of the law-giver.<a name=269:8></a>

		J.T.<a name=296:11></a> The appellation 'Son' conveys the thought of Christ's Person in this gospel.<a name=296:12></a> The Person of the Son is the great feature of it, and He is here presented so as to be apprehended and to become an Object of faith to men.<a name=296:13></a> He is the gift that is given: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son".<a name=296:14></a> Then, as we have noted in verse 35, "The Father loves the Son".<a name=296:15></a> The Person of the Son is stressed in chapter 3, as demonstrating the love that entered into the gift; showing the greatness of it.<a name=296:16></a> Paul says, "He who, yea, has not spared his own Son, but delivered him up for us all", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:32">Romans  8:32</a>.<a name=296:17></a> It is to stress the greatness of the gift, and, therefore, the love involved in it.<a name=296:18></a>

		J.T.<a name=297:25></a> I think so; and if we have time to look at <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#29">1 Chronicles  29</a>we shall see the transition from David to Solomon.<a name=297:26></a> David says, in chapter 28: 4, "And Jehovah the God of Israel chose me out of all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever; for he has chosen Judah to be the prince; and of the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he took pleasure in me to make me king over all Israel; and of all my sons, (for Jehovah has given me many sons,) he has chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of Jehovah over Israel.<a name=297:27></a> And he said to me,

		Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and my courts; for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father".<a name=298:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that is the general thought of the transfer.<a name=298:2></a> God had pleasure in David, but now He is having pleasure in David's son in view of the building; and then in chapter 29, verses 23 - 25, "And Solomon sat on the throne of Jehovah as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.<a name=298:3></a> And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves to Solomon the king.<a name=298:4></a> And Jehovah magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him royal majesty such as had not been on any king before him in Israel".<a name=298:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now these are the facts of the type.<a name=298:6></a> David being the father, and Solomon is brought in to be king.<a name=298:7></a> Solomon sat on the throne of Jehovah.<a name=298:8></a> I think all that is implied in the verse, "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand".<a name=298:9></a> Everyone submitting himself and believing on the Son has eternal life, but "he that is not subject to the Son shall not see life".<a name=298:10></a> This clearly is the position now, and chapter 4 opens it up -- how the true Solomon proceeded; for the Lord, in speaking to the woman, said, "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that says to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water".<a name=298:11></a> Who is He?<a name=298:12></a> That refers to His Person.<a name=298:13></a> The woman had to know, and so has every one, to apprehend Him according to the greatness of His Person.<a name=298:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=299:6></a> Yes.<a name=299:7></a> I believe that leaving Judaea would be a sort of judicial action in view of what was said in verse 36, that "he that is not subject to the Son shall not see life".<a name=299:8></a> In chapter 11 He spoke of going to Judaea and Thomas said, "Let <i>us</i> also go, that we may die with him" (verse 16).<a name=299:9></a> Leaving Judaea evidently implied that hostility to Christ, involving murder, was there.<a name=299:10></a> That would amplify what is said as to wrath abiding on one not subject to the Son.<a name=299:11></a> John anticipated the rejection of Christ from the outset.<a name=299:12></a> "He came to his own, and his own received him not", chapter 1: 11.<a name=299:13></a> The geographical reference here meant that.<a name=299:14></a> Jerusalem was the centre of opposition and, of course, Judaea included it.<a name=299:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=299:19></a> Yes.<a name=299:20></a> He said earlier, "for unless ye shall believe that I am [he], ye shall die in your sins" (verse 24).<a name=299:21></a> Then He says, "<i>Ye</i> are of the devil, as your father, and ye desire to do the lusts of your father" (verse 44).<a name=299:22></a> John's writings help us peculiarly, because we are at the end of the dispensation, and it is gradually, but surely, becoming apostate; we may as well accept that and face it.<a name=299:23></a> But over against that we have eternal life as believers on the Son, which is an immense thing, and should calm our fears.<a name=299:24></a> The Lord says, elsewhere, "Be not afraid of those who kill the body, but cannot kill the soul", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#10:28">Matthew  10:28</a>.<a name=299:25></a> Eternal life affords us victory in the presence of death.<a name=299:26></a>

		My second point, as you will understand, is fatherly qualities influencing you, affecting your ways, that you should be walking in the steps of our father Abraham, which he had before circumcision and after circumcision; that he might be the father of all of us gentiles, who, although we do not belong to the circumcision, are children of faith, the faith which he had.<a name=318:16></a> As Scripture says, "Ye are all God's sons by faith in Christ Jesus", <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3:26">Galatians  3:26</a>.<a name=318:17></a> That is a wonderful, but also a most practical thing, because it

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=341:1></a> I think the brethren know that at these readings we are still considering the subject of life.<a name=341:2></a> It is thought that we should look at <a href="../bible/John.htm#5">John  5</a>at this time, where the thought of life is connected peculiarly with the divine Persons.<a name=341:3></a> The chapter stands connected with the remarkable sign which is recorded there, and which leads up to the great subject now before us, so that verse 17 says, "My Father worketh hitherto and I work".<a name=341:4></a> The Father and the Son are introduced in this informal way by the Lord Himself, as working.<a name=341:5></a> The Father is mentioned first as working, and then the Son.<a name=341:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.N.<a name=341:7></a>W.<a name=341:8></a> Would you say the subject is in relation to divine Persons?<a name=341:9></a> Verse 26 says, "For even as the Father has life in himself, so he has given to the Son also to have life in himself".<a name=341:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=341:11></a> That is a striking evidence of what has been remarked, bringing the two Persons into our view as having life, each in Himself.<a name=341:12></a> The Father has given to the Son to have life in Himself.<a name=341:13></a> So that it is the economy that is in mind, not the relations of divine Persons in their abstract condition, but as come out into an administration where the Father comes first, then the Son, and then the Spirit; so that all proceeds from the Father, and if the Son has life in Himself, it is as given to Him by the Father.<a name=341:14></a> And what enters into this is the matter of quickening, which may be perhaps taken in its order.<a name=341:15></a> We have to keep in mind that the divine Persons are introduced in a specific way, and we can take each item relative to life by itself and compare it to see how it bears on the great subject of the chapter; that is, the Father and the Son operating here.<a name=341:16></a> So that the Lord says,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.R.<a name=342:8></a> Does the thought of quickening suggest the idea of death in the person that is operated upon?<a name=342:9></a>

		J.T.<a name=342:10></a> That is the idea.<a name=342:11></a> New birth is hardly that.<a name=342:12></a> It is not presented that way, but the need for quickening implies that the person is morally dead.<a name=342:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=342:16></a> It is the same truth only presented in John in relation to the Father and the Son.<a name=342:17></a> In Ephesians, it is God: ".<a name=342:18></a>.<a name=342:19></a>.<a name=342:20></a> because of his great love wherewith he loved us (we too being dead in offences,) has quickened us with the Christ, (ye are saved by grace,) and has raised us up together" (verses 4 - 6).<a name=342:21></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=343:2></a> I think so; it is the widest range of our subject that we can get.<a name=343:3></a> It is a question of <i>life</i> in John.<a name=343:4></a> We have come a good way in John on this subject, and this is, you might say, the acme of it -- the Father and the Son occupied in the same operation, the work of quickening.<a name=343:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=343:6></a> Is verse 17 the work of the Father and the Son in view of the restoration of life and rest; as though the creation had been disturbed?<a name=343:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=343:8></a> Well, it is a question of death, sin having entered by man; death following on that necessitated that God should operate; but the Lord calls Him the Father here.<a name=343:9></a> Undoubtedly the allusion is to what happened immediately after the creation was interfered with -- this moral question of sin and death consequent upon it.<a name=343:10></a> I believe that is what is in mind.<a name=343:11></a> And this chapter is the divine answer to all that, as to how it is met.<a name=343:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.N.<a name=343:13></a>W.<a name=343:14></a> Two actions of the Father are mentioned, and one of the Son.<a name=343:15></a> The Father raises the dead and quickens them, quickening mentioned after the raising; but the Son quickens whom He will.<a name=343:16></a> Will you say a word as to that?<a name=343:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=343:18></a> Verse 20 has to be considered from the standpoint of love, that is, "the Father loves the Son".<a name=343:19></a> We had this statement already in chapter 3 in relation to the economy.<a name=343:20></a> "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand" (verse 35).<a name=343:21></a> But here, "the Father loves the Son and shews him all things which he himself does; and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may wonder.<a name=343:22></a> For even as the Father raises the dead and quickens them, thus the Son also quickens whom he will" (verses 20, 21).<a name=343:23></a> Thus we are right into our subject in this chapter; that is, the operational services of divine Persons, and the Lord is stressing that the Father has the first

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.N.<a name=344:13></a>W.<a name=344:14></a> Does raising apply to the body and quickening to the soul or the spirit?<a name=344:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=344:16></a> Well, quickening refers to the body, too.<a name=344:17></a> Now, if you look at <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:11">Romans  8:11</a>, for instance, you will see this: "But if the Spirit of him that has raised up Jesus from among the dead dwell in you, he that has raised up Christ from among the dead shall quicken your mortal bodies also on account of his Spirit which dwells in you".<a name=344:18></a> So that the idea of quickening attaches to our bodies.<a name=344:19></a> It is the voice of the Lord Jesus, the Son of God, we are told in this chapter -- <a href="../bible/John.htm#5">John  5</a>"Wonder not at this, for an hour is coming in which all who are in the tombs shall hear his voice, and shall go forth; those that have practised good, to resurrection of life, and those that

		have done evil, to resurrection of judgment".<a name=345:1></a> I referred to this verse because it is said they shall <i>go forth</i> -- well, the idea of quickening must be there to enable them to go forth.<a name=345:2></a> There is power inwardly, and evidently it extends to the body because they come out, or go forth.<a name=345:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=345:4></a> Do we see that somewhat enlarged in chapter 11?<a name=345:5></a> The Lord says, "Lazarus, come forth".<a name=345:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=345:7></a> Quite so; the dead came forth.<a name=345:8></a> So that we are to consider this great matter according to all the facts relative to it; that quickening, it would appear, begins inwardly, if there be any lapse of time at all.<a name=345:9></a> I am speaking now of a person actually being raised, that even if we may speak of time -- it is the twinkling of an eye -- it hardly enters into the matter.<a name=345:10></a> But if we do consider it at all it would seem that the operation of quickening must begin inwardly and work outwardly.<a name=345:11></a> So that there is the hearing of the voice of the Son of God, and then immediately there is the idea of the going forth, which implies that the body, as moving, has power in it.<a name=345:12></a> The whole man is affected; therefore he goes forth.<a name=345:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.R.<a name=345:14></a>C.<a name=345:15></a> Well, then, would the scripture in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#27">Matthew  27</a>, speaking of the saints arising from their graves, bear out what you are saying about going forth?<a name=345:16></a> It reads, "And the tombs were opened; and many bodies of the saints fallen asleep arose, and going out of the tombs after his arising, entered into the holy city and appeared unto many" (verses 52, 53).<a name=345:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=345:18></a> That confirms what we are saying, that they did not immediately arise; it was <i>after Christ's</i> arising.<a name=345:19></a> But the incident is brought in here to show that it is real resurrection for a testimony at that time, and, of course, indicates what the resurrection will be; that there is the principle of going forth.<a name=345:20></a> But then, also, there is the hearing before they go forth.<a name=345:21></a>

		J.T.<a name=380:7></a> It is different from <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>.<a name=380:8></a> The Lord does not say to Peter, 'the Father has revealed Me in you'.<a name=380:9></a> He says, "Flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens".<a name=380:10></a> And then He adds, "And <i>I</i> also, I say unto thee that thou art Peter" (verses 17, 18).<a name=380:11></a> That is, the Lord is speaking about Peter as the material; and, further, He speaks about Himself as the Builder.<a name=380:12></a> Now Paul says of himself, "God .<a name=380:13></a>.<a name=380:14></a>.<a name=380:15></a> was pleased to reveal his Son in me, that I may announce him as glad tidings", <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#1:16">Galatians  1:16</a>.<a name=380:16></a> It is another line of things.<a name=380:17></a> It would involve Paul's affections.<a name=380:18></a> In that same section he says of the Lord, ".<a name=380:19></a>.<a name=380:20></a>.<a name=380:21></a> who has loved me and given himself for me", <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:20">Galatians  2:20</a>.<a name=380:22></a> I believe Paul's affections are involved in the expression, "reveal his Son in me".<a name=380:23></a>
