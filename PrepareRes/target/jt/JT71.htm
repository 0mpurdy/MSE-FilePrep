		J.T.<a name=1:2></a> The subject suggested for this series of readings is Man.<a name=1:3></a> The passages read are, as the brethren will understand, just preliminary to the subject which will, if God permit, require twelve readings.<a name=1:4></a> It is hoped that these scriptures will open up to us, beginning, as they do, with <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>and going on almost to the end of the New Testament in the epistle to the Hebrews.<a name=1:5></a> It is to be observed that the first time God said, "Let us", it is to bring out this matter of manhood: "Let us make man in our image".<a name=1:6></a> "Male and female", it says, "created he them", and they were to have dominion.<a name=1:7></a> The feminine is included in the statement in verse 27, yet the woman did not appear until chapter 2; and in that chapter we have the name "Jehovah" included in the divine titles, as if there are peculiar feelings of affection as the thought of man comes into view.<a name=1:8></a> Then as we shall see as we proceed, the New Testament adds the idea of Christ, the Lord Jesus, as indeed His name is; we see Jesus, because that is the prime thought to be reached, not simply man, but Jesus.<a name=1:9></a> Then it is to be noted in the second chapter that although the lower creatures are named by Adam, yet he found, it is said, no counterpart, his like.<a name=1:10></a> Adam himself, it would seem, had in mind to find some such one, but he did not find her; but God found her for him.<a name=1:11></a> All that leads up to the grand thought of the assembly, as Paul says, "<i>I</i> speak as to Christ, and as to the assembly", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:32">Ephesians  5:32</a>.<a name=1:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.B.<a name=1:13></a>P.<a name=1:14></a> Is the woman seen as complementary to the man?<a name=1:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:16></a> Well, it says in chapter 2:20, "And Man gave names to all cattle", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:20">Genesis  2:20</a>.<a name=1:17></a> The word Man is written

	<div class="paragraph">
		with a capital.<a name=2:1></a> I should have mentioned at first that there are probably twenty terms in Scripture denoting manhood, words used for "man", which indicates in itself what a subject it is.<a name=2:2></a> So in this 20th verse it is said, "And Man gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the heavens, and to every beast of the field; but as for Adam, he found no helpmate, his like" <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:20">Genesis  2:20</a>.<a name=2:3></a> It is not said that God did not find her, but that <i>he</i> found no helpmate, his like.<a name=2:4></a> Then it says in verse 21, "And Jehovah Elohim caused a deep sleep to fall upon Man; and he slept.<a name=2:5></a> And he took one of his ribs and closed up flesh in its stead And Jehovah Elohim built the rib that he had taken from Man into a woman; and brought her to Man And Man said, This time it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh this shall be called Woman, because this was taken out of a man Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and cleave to his wife; and they shall become one flesh" <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:21">Genesis  2:21</a> - 24.<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So that the subject now before us is clearly laid out in these early verses of Scripture.<a name=2:7></a> It also says in chapter 2 that "there was no man to till the ground But a mist went up from the earth, and moistened the whole surface of the ground And Jehovah Elohim formed Man, dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and Man became a living soul" <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:5">Genesis  2:5</a> - 7.<a name=2:8></a> So that the account is made very clear to us, the second chapter adding greatly to the facts of the first chapter.<a name=2:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.W.<a name=2:10></a>S.<a name=2:11></a> How do you view the "us" of verse 26?<a name=2:12></a> "And God said, Let us make man"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:13></a> The three divine Persons may be involved; otherwise it might be simply the "us" of dignity But I think it is safer to regard it that the three divine Persons are involved.<a name=2:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		L.W.<a name=2:15></a> How should we look at what Elihu says in <a href="../bible/Job.htm#33:4">Job  33:4</a> in relation to this matter?<a name=2:16></a> He says, "The

		Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life", <a href="../bible/Job.htm#33:4">Job  33:4</a>.<a name=3:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:2></a> That is simply a statement of facts; it might be said of Adam too; only as we come down the line to a great number of persons one of them can designate things, he can give an account of himself.<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.R.<a name=3:4></a> There appear to be two meanings to this word 'man:' there is one meaning in verse 26 and another in verse 27.<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:6></a> Yes; the first one may mean 'red earth', that is the accepted meaning of it; the note says 'earthy', but the word 'red' is alleged to enter into it.<a name=3:7></a> In any case it would be 'earthy'.<a name=3:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.R.<a name=3:9></a> Does 'the Adam' (verse 27), include the woman?<a name=3:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:11></a> That involves another name still; Ish is man and Ishshah is woman.<a name=3:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.R.<a name=3:13></a> Would it be right to say that the woman is included in the second word for man?<a name=3:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:15></a> In the divine mind she was included in verse 26, but we can see as we read on that she was not actually included; God built her, a remarkable thing.<a name=3:16></a> It is the first time that we get the word 'built', and it refers to woman.<a name=3:17></a> It does not say of Adam that he was built.<a name=3:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.W.<a name=3:19></a>S.<a name=3:20></a> Is there some distinction as to that, in that male and female are created; and would it be right to say that the assembly is created?<a name=3:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:22></a> Just so, it is created.<a name=3:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.F.<a name=3:24></a>E.<a name=3:25></a> Why do you think it was in the mind of God that man should be in full maturity at the beginning, 'man' and not 'child'?<a name=3:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:27></a> He was not born, you mean, quite so; it does not say that he was born, he was created, or made.<a name=3:28></a> We might say all others were born.<a name=3:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:30></a>Jr.<a name=3:31></a> Much had come in prior to this reference to man.<a name=3:32></a> This is the sixth day, and as you pointed

		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		out, it says, "Let us", whereas it does not say that as to prior matters on the previous days.<a name=4:1></a> So that you have the creation of all else up to this point till you have the cattle and then man.<a name=4:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:3></a> So that the thing becomes extremely affecting because it has in mind the Lord Jesus; it has in mind the birth of the Lord Jesus; that was in the mind of God.<a name=4:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.R.<a name=4:5></a> You made a remark some time ago as to why God waited until the sixth day to create man.<a name=4:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:7></a> That is a question that has to be considered.<a name=4:8></a> Why had He to wait?<a name=4:9></a> But He did wait.<a name=4:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		V.C.<a name=4:11></a>L.<a name=4:12></a> You spoke recently as to the manner of what was good being in God's mind.<a name=4:13></a> On the sixth day it says God saw that it was <i>very</i> good.<a name=4:14></a> Does that link on with this matter of man?<a name=4:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:16></a> Just so.<a name=4:17></a> And why did He make angels before He made man?<a name=4:18></a> That is another question; and there is no sex mentioned as regards angels, while there is as regards man.<a name=4:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.N.<a name=4:20></a>W.<a name=4:21></a> The cattle are brought into being, apparently, the same day as man.<a name=4:22></a> What is there in that?<a name=4:23></a> "Let the earth bring forth living souls after their kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth, after their kind".<a name=4:24></a> The whole system seems not to be complete until the man comes in verse 26.<a name=4:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:26></a> And then the further instruction we have as to him; it is not simply a question of creation or formation, though there is formation; but in chapter 2:5,6 it says, "And there was no man to till the ground.<a name=4:27></a> But a mist went up from the earth, and moistened the whole surface of the ground.<a name=4:28></a> And Jehovah Elohim formed Man, dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and Man became a living soul", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:5">Genesis  2:5</a> - 7.<a name=4:29></a> So that he is unique in that God breathed into him; not even his wife has the same place of uniqueness.<a name=4:30></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=5:1></a>M.<a name=5:2></a> Verse 20 says, "As for Adam, he found no helpmate, his like", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:20">Genesis  2:20</a>.<a name=5:3></a> You were referring to it just now, and to the matter of angels.<a name=5:4></a> Would a verse like that show how different man was from the order of angels, in that there was something in Adam which required a helpmate?<a name=5:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:6></a> Clearly; "I will make him a helpmate, his like", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:18">Genesis  2:18</a>.<a name=5:7></a> God says.<a name=5:8></a> Although Adam himself evidently had the thought, yet God had it too, and in a fuller way than Adam; so that God had foreseen the need in causing Adam to become asleep.<a name=5:9></a> Thus the figure of death comes in, you might say, to bring out the figure of the assembly.<a name=5:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=5:11></a>M.<a name=5:12></a> I suppose it would be right to say that in creating Adam God so created him that he would not be complete without this addition?<a name=5:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:14></a> That is right, I would say that.<a name=5:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.J.<a name=5:16></a>M.<a name=5:17></a> The Lord uses the same word here for building the woman as in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>where He says, "On this rock I will build my assembly", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:18">Matthew  16:18</a>.<a name=5:18></a> Does that fit in here?<a name=5:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:20></a> Yes, so that we can see that these wonderful things were in the divine mind from the very outset, from <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>right down: "on this rock I will build my assembly, and hades' gates shall not prevail against it", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:18">Matthew  16:18</a>.<a name=5:21></a> It is not that hades' gates shall not prevail against God, but against 'it'.<a name=5:22></a> The 'it' is remarkable, the 'it' is the assembly.<a name=5:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.H.<a name=5:24></a> What is the thought of "in our image" and "after our likeness"?<a name=5:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:26></a> Well, image is representation, and likeness is just what the word says like God.<a name=5:27></a> The man represents God and he is like God.<a name=5:28></a> That could not be said of angels.<a name=5:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=5:30></a> Man is so important according to God that the divine mind called him into being; it was not as with the other creatures where God said, "Let there be light", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:3">Genesis  1:3</a>.<a name=5:31></a>

		and "Let the waters swarm", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:20">Genesis  1:20</a> and so forth.<a name=6:1></a> With man He said, "Let us".<a name=6:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:3></a> Yes, the "us" is mentioned there for the first time, as if it was a special matter, a peculiar matter, the only one of its kind really.<a name=6:4></a> And it points to Christ, I think.<a name=6:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.S.<a name=6:6></a>C.<a name=6:7></a> Why are the absence of rain and the absence of man put together here?<a name=6:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:9></a> The absence of rain was made up for by the mist.<a name=6:10></a> Chapter 1:26 gives the fact that God made man; it says, "Let us make man in our image", but we have to see that it was anticipative; we have to wait for chapter 2:5 to get the facts, as if we are given to understand that the matter is very important.<a name=6:11></a> It is mentioned twice as to man, in chapter 1 and in chapter 2, and in much more detail in chapter 2; and then again as to woman, how she was formed; she was formed in an entirely different way from Adam, she was built, as if we are to be reminded that the assembly is built.<a name=6:12></a> It is a remarkable thing.<a name=6:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.A.<a name=6:14></a>L.<a name=6:15></a> Not only was the building of the woman entirely God's matter, but also the thought behind it, would you say?<a name=6:16></a> Because it does not appear here that Adam desired a wife; it does not say so in Scripture, does it?<a name=6:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:18></a> It is just a question of verse 20: "Man gave names", it says, "to all cattle, and to the fowl of the heavens, and to every beast of the field; but as for Adam, he found no helpmate, his like", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:20">Genesis  2:20</a>.<a name=6:19></a> It does not say that God did not find, but that Adam did not find.<a name=6:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.A.<a name=6:21></a>L.<a name=6:22></a> But the thought behind the building of a woman was not that of another Adam, that is what I meant; it was not to be of his own sex.<a name=6:23></a> Was not the thought behind it purely God's matter?<a name=6:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:25></a> Oh, quite so, but it was Adam's matter, too, for it says he found no helpmate, his like.<a name=6:26></a> And his

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		like would mean like himself, only in the feminine sense; as one has said, It is myself over again.<a name=7:1></a> So Adam might say, It is myself over again.<a name=7:2></a> It is a female instead of a male, but it is the same idea.<a name=7:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=7:4></a> In the antitype, did the Lord have any feelings like these you were alluding to in verse 20?<a name=7:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:6></a> Just what is in your mind as to the antitype?<a name=7:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=7:8></a> I am thinking of the Lord when He came here according to the gospels, what did He find?<a name=7:9></a> Did He find anything for Himself, or did it await the coming of the Spirit?<a name=7:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:11></a> Well, it is a question of our minds coming into action as we are here together to help each other; as to whether there is anything in the gospels that would suggest to the Lord's mind this idea that we are now dealing with.<a name=7:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.J.<a name=7:13></a>M.<a name=7:14></a> I was thinking of the Lord seeking; He came as a merchantman seeking goodly pearls, it says; and when He had found one pearl of great price, He sold all that He had and purchased it.<a name=7:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:16></a> That is good, that is a direct allusion I would say to this whole matter.<a name=7:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.N.<a name=7:18></a>W.<a name=7:19></a> Would not the beauty that He saw be but the reflection of Himself?<a name=7:20></a> The pearl was a beautiful one but was not that beauty His own reflection?<a name=7:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:22></a> So that as I was saying -- it is not my own remark -- Adam could say, It is myself over again; only a woman instead of a man.<a name=7:23></a> We must understand therefore that the assembly is Christ over again, only in the feminine sense.<a name=7:24></a> So that the real idea must develop in the sense that Christ represents the masculine and the assembly represents the feminine.<a name=7:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.H.<a name=7:26></a>E.<a name=7:27></a> Does <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>help?<a name=7:28></a> It says, "According as he has chosen us in him before the world's foundation, that we should be holy and blameless before him in love; having marked us out beforehand for adoption through Jesus Christ to himself", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:4">Ephesians  1:4</a>,5.<a name=7:29></a>

		A.R.<a name=8:4></a> Did Saul of Tarsus learn what you have been saying when the Lord said to him, "<i>I</i> am Jesus, whom <i>thou</i> persecutest"?<a name=8:5></a> Is that Himself over again, on earth?<a name=8:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:9></a>Jr.<a name=8:10></a> The idea of the image must have been on Adam's mind when he was looking at the animals as they came; what he was looking for would not be this animal, or that.<a name=8:11></a> The image must have been what affected him.<a name=8:12></a> It was the same form.<a name=8:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:14></a> And then, of course, God had to put Adam, as it were, through death; Adam must suffer; not indeed that there was actual suffering, but the figure of the thing is there, that he must go through death, as the Lord Jesus did, in order to have his wife.<a name=8:15></a> The Lord Jesus gave Himself for the assembly; He loved the assembly and gave Himself for it.<a name=8:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.H.<a name=8:17></a>L.<a name=8:18></a> Then we are entitled to look at the assembly without previous history or taint of sin?<a name=8:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:20></a> Just so, that is good; without previous history and without suggestion of sin.<a name=8:21></a> It is entirely a question of God, His own suggestion, only that Christ comes into it of course.<a name=8:22></a>

		So that we have Moses prominently in the divine mind in this passage; and he is in a lowly attitude, for it is at the thorn-bush.<a name=208:1></a> God called to him out of the midst of the thorn-bush saying, "Moses, Moses!<a name=208:2></a>".<a name=208:3></a> The double mention of his name is to call attention to him, the person drawn out of the water; that is what his name means and it is to give character to his whole life.<a name=208:4></a> We are born of water and of Spirit, everyone of us who is born of God is born of water and of Spirit.<a name=208:5></a> So that Moses has these characteristics.<a name=208:6></a>

		With these remarks we might look at the chapter read because Joshua is peculiarly fitted to follow on Moses; it is a question of the replacement of Moses, a continuation of Moses' ministry.<a name=223:12></a> But at the same time Joshua has a ministry distinct to himself and a distinct commission, as we shall see in the verses read; that is, he is directly commissioned of God.<a name=223:13></a> It is not simply that he is selected to take Moses' place, he is directly commissioned of God to take it; so that it says, "And it came to pass after the death of Moses the servant of Jehovah, that Jehovah spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' attendant, saying, Moses my servant is dead; and now, rise up, go over this Jordan, thou and all this people, into the land which I give unto them, to the children of Israel.<a name=223:14></a> Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread have I given to you, as I said unto Moses.<a name=223:15></a> From the wilderness and this Lebanon to the great river, the river Euphrates, the whole land of the Hittites, to the great sea, toward the going down of the sun, shall be your border.<a name=223:16></a> None shall be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so will I be with thee; I will not leave thee, neither will I forsake thee.<a name=223:17></a> Be strong and courageous, for thou shalt cause this people to inherit the land which I have sworn unto their fathers to give them.<a name=223:18></a> Only be strong and very courageous, that thou mayest take heed to do according to all the law that Moses my servant commanded thee.<a name=223:19></a> Turn not from it to the right or to the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.<a name=223:20></a> This book of the law shall not depart from thy mouth; and thou shalt meditate upon it day and night, that thou mayest take heed to do according to all that is written therein; for then shalt thou have good success in thy ways, and then shalt thou prosper.<a name=223:21></a> Have I not commanded thee: Be strong and courageous?<a name=223:22></a> Be not afraid, neither be dismayed; for Jehovah thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest".<a name=223:23></a>
