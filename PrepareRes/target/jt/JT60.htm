	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:1></a> It is hoped that we shall see, as we proceed at this time, that the functions of the Spirit as seen in this remarkable chapter are enhanced, the apostolic function in the twelve apparently receding somewhat.<a name=1:2></a> It is hoped that, in taking account of things thus, we may get a fresh view of christianity.<a name=1:3></a> It would seem as if the time has arrived for the brethren to review the whole position of christianity and see the bearing of the inaugural period at Pentecost upon the present time as nearing the end.<a name=1:4></a> The chapter we have read calls attention in verse 4 to a memorial before God, from among the nations: meaning that there was a distinct movement upward, toward heaven, resulting from the work of God among the nations.<a name=1:5></a> No doubt it was more or less seen as Paul came in, but the great departure since has affected it adversely, and it is a question now, whether it is really understood that the position is from heaven, the operations are from heaven.<a name=1:6></a> Hence Cornelius is taken up, and although not having yet received the Spirit, his value is such as to give him a place before God <i>above</i>.<a name=1:7></a> Then we have the vision to Peter in his ecstasy, and the sheet coming down from heaven stressing the point that things are from <i>above</i>; yet they have not come to stay, for the end is, that they are going up: all is going up.<a name=1:8></a> There is the cleansing: "What God has cleansed", not ceremonial cleansing, not what baptism affords, but what God does for men so that they are fit to go up.<a name=1:9></a> Along with this there is the acknowledgement of Peter's part in the work according to the divine thought at the beginning, but decidedly

		lessened, it appears, in its importance, for the Spirit came in while Peter was speaking, not waiting for him to finish, as if there was something else to come.<a name=2:1></a> There is a certain urgency in the stress given to the Spirit, and so correspondingly, a result in men is to be expected, because the preparation is evidently going on in heaven.<a name=2:2></a> It has been so always, but evidently stressed at times in order to bring about a better condition amongst the brethren, and state for translation into heaven.<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=2:4></a>G.<a name=2:5></a> Would you say what there is for us in the fact that the vessel is seen descending out of heaven?<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:7></a> Well, God intended that christianity should be a wholly heavenly thing, left down here in testimony, but to be taken up again.<a name=2:8></a> It was done thrice, as a complete witness to what was there, what God had done among men: the animals being typical of men that He had cleansed, so that they could be sent down and taken up, and taken up finally.<a name=2:9></a> It is to impress us with the idea of testimony at this juncture.<a name=2:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.H.<a name=2:11></a> Was there to be a certain change because of God having Paul's ministry in view, which came along soon after this?<a name=2:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:13></a> I would say that.<a name=2:14></a> It had Paul's ministry in view, because Paul appears in chapter 9, in a miraculous way.<a name=2:15></a> The Lord appeared to him and announced that he was an elect vessel to Him; meaning that there were great things in view.<a name=2:16></a> The idea of a vessel stressing what was there.<a name=2:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are directed back to <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#9">Numbers  9</a>in which the movements of the tabernacle in the wilderness are depicted, representing the movements of the testimony in christianity.<a name=2:18></a> What we have in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10">Acts  10</a>is perhaps the most remarkable of these movements.<a name=2:19></a> It is christianity that is in mind in the tabernacle, and although previous movements in Acts would be also typified in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#9">Numbers  9</a>, yet <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10">Acts  10</a>is pre-eminently contemplated.<a name=2:20></a> There was no way in the wilderness, and there

		is no way now; whatever the nations may supply on the lines of travel, there is really no way spiritually, and we have to see that we understand this movement.<a name=3:1></a> It had not taken place yet, of course, but it is doubtful whether it was understood.<a name=3:2></a> One line of things, as in the work of the twelve, was proceeding under God; then another comes in somewhat superseding it and enlarging the view.<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.C.<a name=3:4></a> Would there be something analogous in the seventy going out in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10">Luke  10</a>and the Lord speaking of their names written in heaven?<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:6></a> I think that is a good suggestion, for it brings heaven into view especially from Luke's point of view; of course, Luke wrote the Acts, too.<a name=3:7></a> In <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2">Luke  2</a>, the Lord is celebrated as born, and the announcement included peace on earth, good pleasure in men.<a name=3:8></a> Then the Lord Himself entered on His service, and having sent out the seventy, the view became broadened, and He stresses the fact that the names of the seventy were written in heaven, and that they were not to rejoice in the overthrow of the demons, however important that may have been and is, but rather to rejoice because their names were written in heaven.<a name=3:9></a> Then in chapter 19 the multitude say "<i>peace</i> in heaven, and glory in the highest", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#19:38">Luke  19:38</a>, meaning preparatory peace, and the casting out of the devil.<a name=3:10></a> The Lord had announced in chapter 10 that He saw Satan as lightning fall out of heaven, <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10:18">Luke  10:18</a>, but there was more than that needed, and the Lord has in mind that there is to be a place found for Himself and the assembly in heaven.<a name=3:11></a> It is one of the greatest thoughts, I believe, and there must be ample room found for the Lord as espoused, for the Bridegroom, and the bride.<a name=3:12></a> John brings this out more in the book of the Revelation in view of the conflict with Michael and the devil; the devil being cast out, and then the Lord coming out of heaven in a military sense on the white horse.<a name=3:13></a> So that Luke makes room for

	<div class="paragraph">
		peace; peace in heaven first, and then the peace on earth announced in chapter 2 would come in its time, but peace in heaven must come first, and that is what is now imminent; that is to say, the clearance of heaven of all evil and the establishment there of Christ and the assembly.<a name=4:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.H.<a name=4:2></a>H.<a name=4:3></a> Are you suggesting that the coming of the vessel out of heaven in chapter 10 is to show that the assembly has a heavenly status and a right there?<a name=4:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:5></a> I think so, and Peter was to be impressed with that.<a name=4:6></a> He had not been, and that would, I suppose, apply to the twelve, and in fact to all the saints up to that time.<a name=4:7></a> But in the sheet it is a question of man, and the means God has of cleansing man, so that we should be ready for heaven.<a name=4:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=4:9></a>G.<a name=4:10></a> In what does this heavenly status consist?<a name=4:11></a> Is it simply a matter of the good pleasure of God, His purpose, or is there something more than that?<a name=4:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:13></a> I suppose the angelic word in chapter 2 points to the importance of the incarnation, what God would bring about on earth, in view of Christ coming in in His ministry.<a name=4:14></a> But then the further thing is, that He is gone into heaven.<a name=4:15></a> Hence Luke says, in chapter 9, "the days of his receiving up were fulfilled".<a name=4:16></a> <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#9:51">Luke  9:51</a>.<a name=4:17></a> That was most important in the eyes of heaven.<a name=4:18></a> Luke would bring them out already in many ways.<a name=4:19></a> In <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#9">Luke  9</a>Moses and Elias were speaking to the Lord on high about His decease which He should accomplish at Jerusalem, implying that He was going out and going up, for already the days of His receiving up had come about: it would be a great event, and Moses and Elias were speaking to the Lord about the way in which this would be accomplished; he would go up to Jerusalem and die there.<a name=4:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24">Luke  24</a>the Lord proceeds to recover those that were straying, but He had more than that in mind; it was not simply to bring them back to Jerusalem, but to bring them back to the assembly, and to furnish

		instruction to fit them for the further testimony that He was about to inaugurate among the nations beginning at Jerusalem.<a name=5:1></a> He says nothing about the forty days in Luke; He was going up to heaven; that was what was in His mind.<a name=5:2></a> It was not to be delayed, because the administration that He was taking on, that the Father had given into His hands, would be from there.<a name=5:3></a> He went up, He was carried up, we are told.<a name=5:4></a> It is not John's point of view, Luke is expressing heaven's delight in Christ, in accord with Paul's word, that He was "received up in glory", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3:16">1 Timothy  3:16</a>.<a name=5:5></a> It was to give effect to what He had in mind, and, however long that has taken to accomplish, for it is still going on, it was a matter of prime importance in the Lord's mind, that He should be in heaven, that He should go up.<a name=5:6></a> Some of us were speaking of Elijah saying to Elisha, If ye see me when I go up.<a name=5:7></a> That is to say, we are reminded of the importance of what is in heaven, and what God had in mind heaven should be, with men in it.<a name=5:8></a> The first thing is peace in heaven and that is with man in it, with Christ in it.<a name=5:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Ques</i>.<a name=5:10></a> Does that await the presence of the assembly, "peace in heaven"?<a name=5:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:12></a> I would think so.<a name=5:13></a> The conflict with Michael and the devil would mean that the evil is not to be tolerated there.<a name=5:14></a> God must be free in His own domain, and of course we belong to that, and that is the point with us, I am sure.<a name=5:15></a> The time of our receiving up has come.<a name=5:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Ques</i>.<a name=5:17></a> Is there a particular point in the <i>straightway</i> in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10:16">Acts  10:16</a>: "this took place thrice, and the vessel was straightway taken up into heaven".<a name=5:18></a> Does it show that there is a need of urgency, that as soon as the testimony is finished, there is an immediate and forthwith movement to catch the vessel into heaven?<a name=5:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:20></a> Very good, that is just what it is: "the vessel was straightway taken up into heaven", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10:16">Acts  10:16</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		movement among the brethren in this country and generally.<a name=6:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.C.<a name=6:2></a> Would you say something about the description of the great sheet and then the vessel?<a name=6:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:4></a> There is a link between this and the word "vessel" in chapter 9: "this [man] is an elect vessel to me", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:15">Acts  9:15</a>.<a name=6:5></a> It is an operative idea, both in Paul as a vessel and the vessel alluding to the assembly.<a name=6:6></a> The passage in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:12">1 Corinthians  12:12</a>, "so also is the Christ", would allude to the anointed vessel; that is, to what is operative in testimony, but it is to be there in a numerical sense in "many" for God's pleasure as well as Christ's.<a name=6:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.C.<a name=6:8></a> Would the sheet refer to the great expanse of God's operations?<a name=6:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:10></a> I should think the idea of a sheet would be that; it is called a vessel.<a name=6:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Ques</i>.<a name=6:12></a> Do the contents of the sheet refer to the results of Paul's ministry in the way it embraced all the Gentiles?<a name=6:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:14></a> I think so.<a name=6:15></a> "For God is one, and the mediator of God and men one, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom for all, the testimony to be rendered in its own times", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#2:5">1 Timothy  2:5</a>.<a name=6:16></a> Paul said that his testimony extended from Jerusalem round about to Illyricum, pointing to a vast expanse of territory, and it was in order to get the assembly out of it.<a name=6:17></a> I believe that is the position exactly, and hence certain allusions in the Acts point to the West being in mind for the particular property God had and which He needed in heaven.<a name=6:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Ques</i>.<a name=6:19></a> Does the cleansing involve the removing of features not pleasurable to heaven and the producing of features in which heaven can find its delight?<a name=6:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:21></a> Quite so.<a name=6:22></a> Hence baptism is intended to result in that; it is not a mere sacrament to give people an outward status on earth, but intended to be a cleansing matter.<a name=6:23></a> Paul writing to Titus says that "according to his own mercy he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit", <a href="../bible/Titus.htm#3:5">Titus  3:5</a>.<a name=6:24></a> That is in

		God's mind, a real washing, and the renewing of the Holy Spirit coming in upon it.<a name=7:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.H.<a name=7:2></a>H.<a name=7:3></a> As Peter was in an ecstasy he beholds the heavens opened.<a name=7:4></a> Does an ecstasy lead our minds to think of something heavenly?<a name=7:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:6></a> I think God is making him fit for the great matter, for there would be certain joy in what he had, in the "ecstasy".<a name=7:7></a> He needed adjustment, but it was to be a pleasant one, so to speak: it was God's own operation, and through it, Peter is made ready and then, "the Spirit said to him".<a name=7:8></a> The Spirit is the one of the divine Persons who acts here.<a name=7:9></a> It says in verse 19, "as Peter continued pondering over the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, three men seek thee; but rise up, go down, and go with them, nothing doubting, because <i>I</i> have sent them".<a name=7:10></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10:19">Acts  10:19</a>,20 The Spirit is asserting Himself and speaking.<a name=7:11></a> Peter would understand that his own apostleship is not now the point, although it remained, of course, for he had the keys, but there is a widening out of the position; that is, the tabernacle of witness is moving into a wider sphere.<a name=7:12></a> I believe that is what is in mind; the Spirit of God Himself is in charge of the operations.<a name=7:13></a> It is not the Lord, nor God, it is the Spirit Himself, emphatically; He says, "because <i>I</i> have sent them".<a name=7:14></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10:20">Acts  10:20</a>.<a name=7:15></a> The Spirit is in charge, so to speak, and it is for us to see whether we can readjust ourselves if we are not adjusted already to the truth of the Spirit's presence and operations, and make Him everything.<a name=7:16></a> Let us see whether the gifts that are operating are really under Him, whether the whole service is under the Spirit and whether it is all in accord.<a name=7:17></a> For we cannot but see that in the Spirit's coming and taking over believers, Cornelius and his company, there is a certain slight on Peter's ministry, although he is not affected adversely at all, for he accepts it, and says that God is doing the thing, taking it, as it were, from His hand.<a name=7:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Ques</i>.<a name=7:19></a> Would this be one of the cases where the

		<a name=8>[Page 8]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Spirit would come in and take of the things of Christ and make them known?<a name=8:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:2></a> Just so, it is a wide thought.<a name=8:3></a> It is God, the Spirit of God, acting, because Peter's comment afterwards is, "I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, John baptised with water, but <i>ye</i> shall be baptised with the Holy Spirit.<a name=8:4></a> If then God has given them the same gift as also to us when we had believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who indeed was <i>I</i> to be able to forbid God"?<a name=8:5></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#11:16">Acts  11:16</a>,17.<a name=8:6></a> It was <i>God</i>, but then the Spirit taking it on by Himself is to be noticed, because <i>it points to the place He has had ever since in christianity</i>.<a name=8:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Ques</i>.<a name=8:8></a> Do we need discernment to see who it is that is acting, for with Cornelius at the beginning of the chapter it says, "an angel of God" appears to him; he addresses him as Lord, but here it says the Spirit sent Peter.<a name=8:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:10></a> Well, Cornelius was quite right.<a name=8:11></a> It was in keeping with the moment that it should be an angel, but it was a remarkable thing that Cornelius had already built up a memorial before God; that is a thing I am sure ought to be observed.<a name=8:12></a> In the passage before us, it is not an angel, but the Spirit Himself.<a name=8:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Rem</i>.<a name=8:14></a> Would you say a little about the memorial from amongst the gentiles.<a name=8:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:16></a> It points to what God was doing among the gentiles.<a name=8:17></a> In fact, He had been operating, we might say, for long, even during Israel's brightest days, God was carrying on His work amongst the nations.<a name=8:18></a> He is the God of the nations, but now it is a fuller thought.<a name=8:19></a> Here is a man, as we get in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#2">Romans  2</a>, who is already anticipating christianity; in the mind of heaven it was so, for it is said, "Thy prayers and thine alms have gone up for a memorial before God", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10:4">Acts  10:4</a>.<a name=8:20></a> There is no idea of a new family being started, or being in mind, in God taking up Cornelius, although he possessed qualities according to God in his prayers and his alms, but he is being prepared for the assembly, for the great sheet, there

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=9:4></a> Quite so; showing it is held there, I might say, too; it is held firmly.<a name=9:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Ques</i>.<a name=9:6></a> Is the Holy Spirit expressing His delight in the increased liberty He had among the gentiles in Cornelius?<a name=9:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=9:8></a> I think it is well that that should be noticed: it is the delight divine Persons have in the current operations.<a name=9:9></a> For instance, in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15">Luke  15</a>, how the divine Persons are seen engaged in delight in the prodigal's return.<a name=9:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=9:11></a>G.<a name=9:12></a> Does it really involve that God is moving freely now among all men and that in connection with His best thoughts?<a name=9:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=9:14></a> His best thoughts; I am thankful you said that, for we are to keep to His best thoughts in all our services, and make way for them.<a name=9:15></a> If it be the assembly and its use, the vessel here, we should have the best thoughts of God about it, and not drag it down to the level of ordinary matters.<a name=9:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Ques</i>.<a name=9:17></a> Is that seen in the contrast between Peter and Dorcas?<a name=9:18></a> She could make memorials on earth, but there were no prayers or alms of hers, or memorial of her taken account of in heaven.<a name=9:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=9:20></a> That is a good point.<a name=9:21></a> It comes in at the end of <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9">Acts  9</a>, in Peter's own ministry.<a name=9:22></a> Peter was sensible of the change that was coming in, for it is said of him, in that section, that he went to all quarters, corresponding to the sheet, with what was in the mind of God, showing how, in our sensibilities as christians, especially if we are spiritual, we anticipate what may come out in testimony.<a name=9:23></a> So Peter said to Aeneas, "rise up, and make thy couch for thyself", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:34">Acts  9:34</a>.<a name=9:24></a> This is instruction as to how the truth should work out in localities, that the brethren

		should do things for themselves, and not be always writing to others at a distance and asking them questions.<a name=10:1></a> If we relied more on the temple of God <i>in the place</i>, I am sure we would get our questions answered quicker and better than by writing three thousand miles away.<a name=10:2></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:32">Acts  9:32</a> would indicate that Peter was ready for all that was about to transpire in his outlook on the Mediterranean and what he saw at Joppa.<a name=10:3></a> As to Dorcas, the widows who were weeping for her were all put out, showing that Peter was alive to the position.<a name=10:4></a> He was in full accord with what was coming in, at least in chapter 9.<a name=10:5></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=10:9></a> Quite so; <i>all things</i>.<a name=10:10></a> Another thing that arises in connection with that point is brought out in <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#8">Mark  8</a>.<a name=10:11></a> The man at Bethsaida was taken up, the blind man whose eyes the Lord opened, and the final result was that he "saw all things clearly".<a name=10:12></a> That is just the point at the present time, that we should see all things clearly, not only all persons, but all <i>things</i>, involving principles.<a name=10:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=12:13></a> Quite so.<a name=12:14></a> There are plenty of means of meeting the matter without trying to put it on the same level as the Lord's supper.<a name=12:15></a> There is great need for careful analysis of the scriptures that treat of the Lord's supper.<a name=12:16></a> One observes that the idea of a memorial is hardly touched with many.<a name=12:17></a> We hear of the Lord being remembered in His death, whereas the memorial is of Christ in heaven, alive as He is now; it is to recall Him, to bring Him back to mind.<a name=12:18></a> So in order to have the facts of it, the Lord clearly considered what had been done and how loosely things had been done, and gave the facts to Paul after He rose.<a name=12:19></a> The record of the Lord's words to Paul is in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11">1 Corinthians  11</a>, beginning with verse 23 and reaching down to the record as to the cup, and some things we get in the gospels are left out.<a name=12:20></a> The Lord omits certain things that are mentioned in the gospels, and He adds certain things that are not

		J.T.<a name=13:8></a> It is well to stress the <i>absence</i>, to make way for Him, for His love: for it is a love matter, and hence the importance of clearing our minds, so that all we are is excluded for the moment in order to give the Lord a good time, speaking reverently; to give Him what He is looking for, the joy that is set before Him in principle.<a name=13:9></a>

		J.T.<a name=99:1></a> The inquiry alluded to already began with <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>and continued to chapter 14, taking account of certain parts of the history of the assembly, showing at the outset its metropolitan character and bearing, but that under Paul, through him and through his ministry, Barnabas included, the assembly attained its universal character, and with the addition of appointed eldership, as chapter 14 relates, that Paul and Barnabas "having chosen them elders in each assembly, having prayed with fastings, they committed them to the Lord, on whom they had believed".<a name=99:2></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#14:23">Acts  14:23</a>.<a name=99:3></a> This is the first reference to the appointment of elders.<a name=99:4></a> There had been deacons appointed, but now elders, involving rule in <i>each</i> assembly.<a name=99:5></a> It is said, "having chosen them elders <i>in each</i> assembly", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#14:23">Acts  14:23</a>, that is, each assembly being set up with ability to rule itself, to take care of itself to a certain limit, under the Lord, but having relation to all other assemblies, as indeed there is only one in the general sense.<a name=99:6></a> And so along with government, there is to be catholicity, as is taught in 1 Corinthians, Paul saying "thus I ordain in all the assemblies".<a name=99:7></a> <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#7:17">1 Corinthians  7:17</a>.<a name=99:8></a> They were all to be governed by the same principles.<a name=99:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, that runs on, according to the facts, to the end of chapter 14, and then there is a break; not a complete break, but a breakaway from the metropolitan thought, the assembly no longer being wholly regarded as in Jerusalem, as it used to be; the metropolitan was recognised so far, in that certain doctrines having been promulgated by Jews in Jerusalem, and in Judaea, the saints in Antioch decided to send Paul and Barnabas to Jerusalem in view of the bad doctrine being taught.<a name=99:10></a> This really created an epoch in the history of the assembly; it

		is, we might say, the first and last general assembly.<a name=100:1></a> The idea of a general assembly is never recognised after <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#15">Acts  15</a>.<a name=100:2></a> It has been followed by christendom, of course, but not recognised in the Scriptures, nor in the teaching of the apostles and certainly not in the teaching which the Holy Spirit has recovered for us in recent times; that is to say, a century or so ago; so that the idea of a general assembly is never thought of now by those who walk in the truth; it is a question of what is in each assembly, all governed by the same principles, maintaining unity.<a name=100:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is thought that, having these remarks before us, we might pursue the history of the assembly, in the Acts, after chapter 15; that is, after a certain breakdown at Jerusalem, and bad doctrine, and metropolitanism too, and especially the breaking away of Barnabas on account of John Mark.<a name=100:4></a> All these have a bearing on the metropolitan thought, whereas Paul, we are told in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#15:40">Acts  15:40</a>, "having chosen Silas went forth, committed by the brethren to the grace of God".<a name=100:5></a> So the history runs through, recognising, in a large measure, geographical circumstances which have not to be ignored, and involving that the course of the truth of the assembly bore toward the West instead of toward the East, or instead of generally.<a name=100:6></a> The Spirit of God, as recorded in chapter 16, restricted the movements except toward the West.<a name=100:7></a> The Spirit had forbidden the speaking of the word of God in Asia, and following on that, it is said, that "they attempted to go to Bithynia and the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them; and having passed by Mysia they descended to Troas.<a name=100:8></a> And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: There was a certain Macedonian man, standing and beseeching him, and saying, Pass over into Macedonia and help us.<a name=100:9></a> And when he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go forth to Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to announce to them the glad tidings".<a name=100:10></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16:7">Acts  16:7</a> - 10.<a name=100:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=101:5></a> Well, that is true, and it is seen in proportion to the numerical importance of certain localities, or the political importance, it may be.<a name=101:6></a> Whatever may give importance according to man tends in that direction; especially now, since the principle has been set aside by God.<a name=101:7></a> The metropolitan idea was transferred to heaven, really, for "Jerusalem above" is said to be "our mother"; Jerusalem above, not Jerusalem on earth, but Jerusalem above, and that holds now, that all control is from that centre.<a name=101:8></a>

		W.S.<a name=101:9></a>S.<a name=101:10></a> What found expression in Jerusalem on earth, as a metropolitan centre, is really in all our hearts, and we would tend in that direction unless we are preserved from it by the ministry and by the Holy Spirit.<a name=101:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=101:12></a> Hence the great importance of the Holy Spirit as we arrive at this section.<a name=101:13></a> When Paul went to Ephesus, chapter 19, he found certain disciples, twelve men, and he inquired of them as to the Holy Spirit.<a name=101:14></a> Verse 1 says, "Paul, having passed through the upper districts, came to Ephesus, and finding certain disciples, he said to them, Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed"?<a name=101:15></a>, <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#19:1">Acts  19:1</a>,2.<a name=101:16></a> It was on Paul's heart, clearly, especially in view of the number of the persons, namely twelve, an administrative number, that the Holy Spirit should be recognised.<a name=101:17></a> The number would really take the place of metropolitanism; that is, the number of brethren being figurative of administrative power and authority.<a name=101:18></a>

		Paul is showing that at this juncture he was holding for the truth that governed the general position; that is, the general Pauline position of the assembly, so that, the Greek, Titus, was not compelled to be circumcised, and then he says that his going up to Jerusalem was because or on account of "the false brethren brought in surreptitiously, who came in surreptitiously to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage".<a name=102:8></a> <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:4">Galatians  2:4</a>.<a name=102:9></a> The enemy was out to destroy the work of Paul and Barnabas among the gentiles, "to whom we yielded in subjection not even for an hour, that the truth of the glad tidings might remain with you".<a name=102:10></a> <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:5">Galatians  2:5</a>.<a name=102:11></a> There was some competition as to who was who at Jerusalem, "whatsoever they were" (Paul said), "it makes no difference to me: God does not accept man's person; for to me those who were conspicuous communicated nothing; but, on the contrary, seeing that the glad tidings of the uncircumcision were confided to me"; <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:6">Galatians  2:6</a>,7; notice here that "the glad tidings of the uncircumcision", <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:7">Galatians  2:7</a>, is formally recognised, "even as to Peter that of the circumcision (for he that wrought in Peter for the apostleship of the circumcision wrought also in me towards the gentiles) and recognising the grace given to

		J.T.<a name=103:7></a> Well, I think he would lean in that direction.<a name=103:8></a> He was governed, I would say, by Jewish influences at the time.<a name=103:9></a> He left the work, you know, at a critical time, according to chapter 15.<a name=103:10></a> The general position of the assembly reaches up to Corinth in this section.<a name=103:11></a> It presents to us the assembly as it has come to us, centring in the Lord's supper.<a name=103:12></a> Up till this time the Lord's supper was not very prominent; it was there, it is alluded to in chapter 2, but there was very little made of it, but very much is made of it by Paul.<a name=103:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=104:8></a> Well, that raises another point; that is, that geography has something to do with this matter of the truth.<a name=104:9></a> The Spirit of God was moving in that direction; He forbade the word being spoken in Asia, which is remarkable; the word there refers to the province of Asia, not to the Continent, but to the province.<a name=104:10></a> "Having come down to Mysia, they attempted to go to Bithynia", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16:7">Acts  16:7</a>, which would be another section of western Asia, "and the Spirit of Jesus", that too has to be noted; it is "the Spirit of Jesus", meaning that the manhood of Christ is to be observed in the truth.<a name=104:11></a> The Spirit "did not allow them", and then "having passed by Mysia they descended to Troas", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16:8">Acts  16:8</a>, and here "a vision appeared to Paul in the night"; <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16:9">Acts  16:9</a>; we shall see he had another vision in chapter 18, another kind of vision, having another relation, but here it is a vision appeared to Paul in the night.<a name=104:12></a> "There was a certain Macedonian man, standing and beseeching him, and saying, Pass over into Macedonia and help us.<a name=104:13></a> And when he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go forth to Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to announce to them the glad tidings".<a name=104:14></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16:9">Acts  16:9</a>

		The mystery is in mind.<a name=134:1></a> Paul is saying that the completion of the word of God was his matter, given to him, and that it involved the mystery; for the apostles, although they were employed as writers of the inspired page, did not all write about the mystery.<a name=134:2></a> They did not understand it themselves.<a name=134:3></a> It was revealed to Paul and, involves ourselves, dear brethren.<a name=134:4></a> I am free to say that, because we ourselves, our very selves are involved in the term, "the mystery".<a name=134:5></a> It is "the word of God", but the mystery.<a name=134:6></a> It is a question of the assembly and we are interested.<a name=134:7></a> So in our reading meetings week by week we have in our minds that there is something wonderful belonging to us, written for us; something that God Himself had concealed for centuries; yea, until Paul; and it is now disclosed to the saints, to the holy apostles and prophets too particularly, but "to his saints", according to this passage: "the mystery which has been hidden from ages and from generations, but has now been made manifest <i>to his saints</i>", <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:26">Colossians  1:26</a>.<a name=134:8></a> So we have opened up to us personally one of the greatest things; and the question is whether we are really interested.<a name=134:9></a> It is one of the greatest things belonging to ourselves, not belonging to Israel or the nations, or men in general, but to ourselves; that is, to those of us who form the assembly.<a name=134:10></a>

		Now I go on to the second passage to call attention to the completeness of the Deity in Christ.<a name=138:5></a> Again we are confronted with the greatest error, unitarian error, whereas what the apostle aims at building up in this epistle is the deity of Christ: that "in him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily", <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:9">Colossians  2:9</a>.<a name=138:6></a> In chapter 1 it is "in him all the fulness", "was pleased to dwell", <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:19">Colossians  1:19</a>; the word <i>fulness</i> indicating who the <i>Person</i> is.<a name=138:7></a> But chapter 2 is a question of what is in Him <i>bodily</i>; and it enables us to refute and refuse the much error that is current around us, heard constantly in our places of employment, and in the schools, where the children hear it and perhaps drink it in to their loss.<a name=138:8></a> So I refer to this matter of completeness in chapter 2 as a sort of objective matter; not a term that is common and threadbare, but a real matter, that is to be understood.<a name=138:9></a> So chapter 2 is the fulness of the Deity in Christ, <i>bodily</i>.<a name=138:10></a> For that we have to call upon, not only our minds, dear brethren, but our affections.<a name=138:11></a> Our minds are necessary, we can hardly understand anything without our minds.<a name=138:12></a> They are to be pure, renewed; but our affections are now required.<a name=138:13></a> It is a question of the Person and a Person liable to be attacked by perhaps your most intimate friend.<a name=138:14></a> You ought to be on your guard, and if you love

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The passages I have read all refer directly to the Holy Spirit and we shall see that they all treat of the <i>goodness and severity of God</i>.<a name=171:2></a> The three passages read first treat mainly of the severity of God: they treat also of the apostate tendencies of the people of Israel, and the Jewish christians in the early days.<a name=171:3></a> Those in chapters 9 and 10, afford opportunity to consider the grace of the activities of the Holy Spirit in Hebrews.<a name=171:4></a> First I would allude to chapter 1 of the epistle as affording a beautiful presentation of the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=171:5></a> The whole chapter is taken up with a presentation of Himself.<a name=171:6></a> Moreover, the quotations given in the chapter, which is almost entirely made up from the old testament scriptures, are quotations generally from the words of the saints, as if God would associate His people with the glory of His Son; a happy employment indeed, and one that shall not be denied to us eternally.<a name=171:7></a> The Psalms yield, I may say, nearly all the quotations in the first chapter, and we are thus reminded of how God regards the productions of His people, and what they say; especially what they say poetically; for, of course, the Psalms are poetry.<a name=171:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So we are thus brought into relation with God regarding His Son, in eulogising His Son.<a name=171:9></a> He is worthy of it, and any tendency to cast a stain, or discredit on His name is resented in heaven, resented by the Father and by the Holy Spirit.<a name=171:10></a> So it is happy that the saints are brought in, in this wonderful chapter, relative to the glory of the Lord Jesus; His glory as Man, but His glory as God too, for He is "over all, God blessed for ever", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#9:5">Romans  9:5</a>.<a name=171:11></a>

		Well now, chapter 2, as I said, is severe, but I bring it forward, especially because of the young people; most here are in that class, and it is important that they should be encouraged, and, perhaps, admonished, for the days are short.<a name=172:2></a> We read in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#9">Luke  9</a>of the days of the Lord's receiving up, but now the days of the saints' receiving up have come, and the young people need to be ready.<a name=172:3></a> They are exposed to the influences of the world, and this epistle is intended to help them, as I shall seek to show, by presenting the goodness of God, but the severity of God too.<a name=172:4></a> If we enjoy the goodness, we must not shrink, if needed, from having to bear the severity of God.<a name=172:5></a> The apostle says, "Behold then the goodness and severity of God: upon them who have fallen, severity"; <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11:22">Romans  11:22</a>; meaning the Jewish nation.<a name=172:6></a> They were held in the mercy of God at first, as we learn from the epistle of James and other scriptures: they were held through the patience of God who regarded them as His people.<a name=172:7></a> God would go to the full length of regarding them as His people until apostasy sets in.<a name=172:8></a> God is similarly patiently waiting on christendom, for the apostasy has already come: already there are many antichrists, and the apostasy has begun; but nevertheless God is waiting till the last moment in patience.<a name=172:9></a> He waited on the Jews, so James addresses them as God's people, as "the twelve tribes", <a href="../bible/James.htm#1:1">James  1:1</a>.<a name=172:10></a> A critical analysis humanly would not admit of it, but God knows better than the severest critic; and so He retained His people to the last, until all became hopeless.<a name=172:11></a> So the Lord says, "But when ye see Jerusalem encompassed with armies, then know that its desolation is drawn nigh", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#21:20">Luke  21:20</a>; and the Jews were to be scattered among all

		nations.<a name=173:1></a> That was the divine decree, and it has taken place in this very dispensation in which we are, it is the severity of God, even to the extent of scattering the Jews and exposing them to the cruellest treatment at the hands of the gentiles.<a name=173:2></a> God would have us to pay attention to these things, because He says, "upon thee goodness of God, if thou shalt abide in goodness"; <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11:22">Romans  11:22</a>, that is the principle of the passage; goodness will fail and severity will come in immediately, severity on the gentiles, and on ourselves.<a name=173:3></a>

		So, as I said, the young need to be warned, because our God is said in this epistle to be a "consuming fire"; not simply <i>God</i> as such, but "our God"; that is, the believers' God.<a name=173:4></a> "<i>Our</i> God is a consuming fire", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:29">Hebrews  12:29</a>, and hence the warning for the young, and the danger anticipated lest we should "fall away", as it says: "For it is impossible to renew again to repentance those once enlightened, and who have tasted of the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God, and the works of power of the age to come, and have fallen away".<a name=173:5></a> <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#6:4">Hebrews  6:4</a> - 6 Now some of you may be questioning in your minds as to how a person could be so described.<a name=173:6></a> I shall come to that presently.<a name=173:7></a> I mention it now for the young, so that we may awake to the danger of falling away.<a name=173:8></a> As the writer again says in chapter 10: "if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him".<a name=173:9></a> <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:38">Hebrews  10:38</a>.<a name=173:10></a> It is a remarkable expression.<a name=173:11></a> The speaker refers to his soul, not simply to his mind, but his soul, the most feeling part of a person; "my soul shall have no pleasure in him".<a name=173:12></a> <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:38">Hebrews  10:38</a>.<a name=173:13></a> So God is warning us.<a name=173:14></a> He is willing to go to the very extremity, as I said, in goodness and patience, but at the same time, the time comes when there is no pleasure, and a person drawing back is left to the deserts of his apostasy.<a name=173:15></a>

		Well now, we have in chapter 2 the first passage that treats of the Holy Spirit; in chapter 3 there is a similar passage, and in chapter 6 a further passage, and one

		more severe than any.<a name=174:1></a> I intend briefly to run over those three passages so that we may see how the goodness of God and the severity of God are combined in the exhortation.<a name=174:2></a> First as to what had been heard, the writer says, "Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:1">Hebrews  2:1</a>, or "we should slip away", as it reads m the New Translation.<a name=174:3></a> "For if the word which was spoken by angels was firm and every transgression and disobedience received just retribution; how shall we escape if we have been negligent of so great salvation; which having had its commencement in being spoken of by the Lord, and has been confirmed to us by those who have heard him"?<a name=174:4></a> <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:2">Hebrews  2:2</a>,3 Now, you will observe, that the speaking here is by the Lord, not by the apostles.<a name=174:5></a> Indeed the epistle opens in this way: "God, having spoken in many parts and in many ways formerly to the fathers in the prophets, at the end of these days has spoken to us <i>in the person of the Son</i>"; <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:1">Hebrews  1:1</a>,2, that is to say, God has approached us in the most tender and compassionate way, in that the gospel has come through <i>the Son</i>, not simply through the apostles, but the Son.<a name=174:6></a> He hath "spoken to us in the person of his Son".<a name=174:7></a> <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:1">Hebrews  1:1</a>,2.<a name=174:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If any confirmation were needed to help individuals as to doctrine, the apostles were employed, of course, because we are told that the converts persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, but the speaking according to this epistle is by the Son; and one would appeal to all, especially the young people, as to the tender sympathies of the Son of God.<a name=174:9></a> The apostle Paul said, "God", "was pleased to reveal his Son in me", <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#1:15">Galatians  1:15</a>,16.<a name=174:10></a> That is, not <i>to</i> me, but "<i>in</i> me": the inwardness of it is indicated, and the love of God, so beautifully expressed to Paul, is to be seen and admired in his gospel.<a name=174:11></a> But then it is not even Paul here, although he is the writer of this epistle, undoubtedly, but he is not the speaker; the Lord is the Speaker, the Son of God is the Speaker; and hence the terribleness of the judgment

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I turn to this passage, because I wanted to say something about the coming in of the Holy Spirit, how He comes in in these last days; how, as it were, He stresses Himself, so that the Spirit, as I said, is mentioned in these five passages, the first three dealing severely, the second two dealing in grace.<a name=175:3></a> Now this passage says that the Lord Jesus was the Speaker, so that all who heard the gospel heard the Lord Jesus.<a name=175:4></a> He says Himself that He had not gone over the cities of Israel; that was, at that particular time.<a name=175:5></a> He said, "I must needs announce the glad tidings of the kingdom of God to the other cities also", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4:43">Luke  4:43</a>, as if it must come to them in the grace of the Son, the affections of the Son.<a name=175:6></a> Then, if any confirmation was necessary, well, there are the apostles; for the Lord was armed with the apostles.<a name=175:7></a> You will understand the word <i>armed</i>: I am not using it as a military word, but in the sense of having them by Him in His ministry.<a name=175:8></a> You will find, for instance, in coming to inaugurate His supper, "the twelve" were with Him; and then again, "the apostles" were with Him.<a name=175:9></a> He Himself distinguishes between "the apostle" and "the twelve", "the apostles" referring to authority and "the twelve" to administration.<a name=175:10></a> He was therefore armed, so to speak, with the twelve, and so here.<a name=175:11></a> What He said was confirmed by them, but the things that were preached to the Jews were from the Lord's own lips.<a name=175:12></a> Hence, "how shall we escape, if we have been negligent of so great salvation; which having had its commencement in being spoken of by the Lord, and has been confirmed to us by those who have heard; God bearing besides, witness with them to it both by signs and wonders, and various acts of power, and distributions of the

		The Spirit is coming into peculiar prominence at the present time, since as far back as forty years I would say.<a name=176:8></a> Those of us who have been here all these years will observe how the Spirit of God has been acquiring a place, and how mere officialism, involving tides, is either disappearing or receding.<a name=176:9></a> The Spirit of God is to have the place, it is His dispensation; it is the day of the Spirit.<a name=176:10></a> John said of the Lord, "the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified", <a href="../bible/John.htm#7:39">John  7:39</a>.<a name=176:11></a> But now He is glorified, and this epistle makes much of the Spirit, not mentioning apostolic names at all, but mentioning persons as receiving various distributions of the Spirit.<a name=176:12></a> It is important for us to make way for them, and to pray for them, so that we may get the good of the Spirit through those whom He has constituted ministers -- ministers of the truth.<a name=176:13></a> Here they confirm the Lord Jesus; that is the point, that all ministry must be confirmed either by the Lord's own words, or by the Scriptures; but they confirm what the Lord said, not adding more.<a name=176:14></a> The Lord's words were confirmed by those who heard Him, and then those who had received the various distributions of the Spirit.<a name=176:15></a>

		The first word I would say as to chapter 9 is: "Now these things being thus ordered, into the first tabernacle the priests enter at all times, accomplishing the services; but into the second the high priest only, once a year, not without blood, which he offers for himself and for the errors of the people: the Holy Spirit showing this, that the way of the holy of holies has not yet been made manifest, while as yet the first tabernacle has its standing".<a name=182:1></a> <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9:6">Hebrews  9:6</a> - 8.<a name=182:2></a> That means, that there had been a time of prohibition; the door into the holiest was shut.<a name=182:3></a> That is spoken of here, and the Holy Spirit is signifying that, in what He says.<a name=182:4></a> So we have the types brought before us, and the types are part of the subject of ministry at the present time.<a name=182:5></a> We who are engaged in the ministry would be in a very poor way if we did not have the types to minister from; the books of Moses; and then if we did not have the prophetic word to minister from, the prophets; and then if we did not have the Psalms, the books of Psalms; but we have them all; therefore the richness of the ministry.<a name=182:6></a> The difference between the present time and the past time is, that the past time was marked by prohibition, when the way into the Holiest was not made manifest; whereas now it is, and that leads me to <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:14">Hebrews  10:14</a>: "For by one offering he has perfected in perpetuity the sanctified.<a name=182:7></a> And the Holy Spirit also bears us witness of it for after what was said: This is the covenant which I will establish towards them after those days, saith the Lord: Giving my laws into their hearts, I will write them also in their understandings; and their sins and their lawlessnesses I will never remember any more".<a name=182:8></a> You may say, 'That is not the same as you have said already'.<a name=182:9></a> It is not, because I was speaking of the severity of God, a point that is stressed in this epistle, but now I am speaking of the goodness of God, and "the goodness of God leads thee to repentance", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#2:4">Romans  2:4</a>.<a name=182:10></a> Whoever you may be, even though you may not have gone all the way, but you are

		Now in chapter 9, the Holy Spirit is showing things, meaning, that He is not hiding them from us.<a name=183:5></a> He is showing them to us, and the showing comes out through the ministry; through our Bible readings, and our addresses, and so forth, by men who are fitted to serve in this way.<a name=183:6></a> It is the time of <i>showing</i> things; that is chapter 9; "the Holy Spirit shewing this, that the way of the holy of holies has not yet been made manifest".<a name=183:7></a> <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9:8">Hebrews  9:8</a>.<a name=183:8></a> That was shown, but now we have the fact that it <i>is</i> made manifest, and chapter 10 says, that if we have any sins and we are believers, God does not remember them any more.<a name=183:9></a> It is marvellous as over against chapter 6, but, you see, we have to do with God, and He is still God, and the Spirit is still the Spirit, and Jesus is still Jesus, and forgiveness is still forgiveness.<a name=183:10></a> So that if there is a spark of life in you, a spark of the work of God in you, there is hope for you.<a name=183:11></a> If you are at all minded to give up, listen to the words in these remarkable chapters, firstly in this ninth chapter, in which things are shown to you.<a name=183:12></a> Turn round and look at the things that the Spirit is showing to you.<a name=183:13></a> He is showing them through the gifts.<a name=183:14></a> He is here to do that, to guide us into <i>all</i> the truth.<a name=183:15></a>

		I go on for a moment to speak of the holiest; <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:18">Hebrews  10:18</a>: "But where there is remission of these, there is no longer a sacrifice for sin"; that means, there is no need of it.<a name=185:4></a> <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:19">Hebrews  10:19</a> - 22 says, "Having therefore, brethren, boldness for entering into the holy of holies by the blood of Jesus, the new and living way which he has dedicated for us through the veil, that is, his flesh, and having a great priest over the house of God, let us approach with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, sprinkled as to our hearts from a wicked conscience, and washed as to our body with pure water".<a name=185:5></a> That is grace.<a name=185:6></a> The water is there, the High Priest is there; everything is there.<a name=185:7></a> It is divine provision, all in pure grace for those who are subjects of the work of God; not for the apostates, there is no open door for them at all.<a name=185:8></a> Let no one think I am saying too much, because what I am saying is the truth: apostasy has set in, but the work of God is here yet, and God is here, and to anyone who is the subject of the work of God, I would say to you, 'Your sins are forgiven: they are not remembered at all by God', He says, "I will remember them no more"; and as forgiven, the holiest is not barred to you.<a name=185:9></a> It was only into the first part, the holy place, that the priests went to carry on the service of God; but only once in the year the high priest entered into the holiest; but now our High Priest is there all the time.<a name=185:10></a> Our High Priest is in heaven and the Holy Spirit is here below; all for us; so that, it is nothing but privilege, nothing but grace; first, as I said, in chapter 9, but the privileges that are open to us in chapter 10 are marvellous, and they are to be set over against the severity of the passages read from chapters 2, 3 and 6.<a name=185:11></a> I leave the word spoken that God may use it, especially to the young here.<a name=185:12></a>

		Isaac stands out more as a type, than a man, but he took account of Jacob's future as to his marriage, or household, and so we find in the history earlier than the chapter I read, a great deal about Jacob's natural relatives, his uncles, his aunts, his cousins and his brothers, and we all have to say to them.<a name=201:15></a> We cannot despise them.<a name=201:16></a> However spiritual we may be we must recognise natural claims.<a name=201:17></a> They may be a great test or snare to us, and sometimes it is so, but we cannot ignore them.<a name=201:18></a> The Lord did not, and it is very beautiful that His brothers and sisters, and we may say His mother,

		I have in mind at this time to speak about <i>resignation</i>, and I have chosen Jonah and Peter, both in relation to God's dealings with them to bring them to submission to God's will.<a name=232:1></a> Jonah was a man like some of us, under commission, and he failed to carry it out.<a name=232:2></a> The work of God is based on the principle of submission to God's will, not on the principle of each doing his own will, but doing the will of God.<a name=232:3></a> The apostle Paul made much of this principle.<a name=232:4></a> There are many in whom there is a work of God, serving professedly, but making little of this principle of surrender to God's will, and hence much irregularity, to say the least, enters into their service.<a name=232:5></a> But God in His mercy takes up some of us in His service and disciplines us so that we may serve better if not <i>entirely</i> well, and so He took up Jonah.<a name=232:6></a> Jonah was destined to have great prominence in the service of God, indeed rising to be a remarkable type of the Lord Jesus, and it is within the range of every one who is serving to rise to this great privilege.<a name=232:7></a> Even the youngest here who is not specially commissioned may become, as he pursues the line of the will of God, if not a type of the Lord Jesus, at least a model patterned after Him, for the Lord sets Himself before us in this way, "Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11:29">Matthew  11:29</a>.<a name=232:8></a> Learn <i>from</i> Me, not simply of Me, but Learn from Me.<a name=232:9></a> That is learning from the Lord as a model so as to become like Him in some degree, however little, because He is the model of all that God has in mind.<a name=232:10></a>

		I am not seeking to preach the gospel as is often the case in taking up Jonah, but I am leading up to the idea of resignation, entire resignation to the will of God.<a name=233:9></a> I have spoken of the hard road and any one affected by prejudices either national or otherwise is sure to come in for a hard way.<a name=233:10></a> Servants of God have often been affected by them in this sense, but they come in for a hard way.<a name=233:11></a> You will recall what is said about another great servant, namely Elijah.<a name=233:12></a> He set out on a journey too, of his own will.<a name=233:13></a> He set out in fear, he was afraid of Jezebel.<a name=233:14></a> In one sense it was quite right to be afraid of her influence, but it was not right to quail before her in the maintenance of truth.<a name=233:15></a> God said to him, as he set out, "the journey is too great for thee", <a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#19:7">1 Kings  19:7</a>.<a name=233:16></a> We all remember how God in His mercy came in for His servant.<a name=233:17></a> Elijah came into the wilderness of Beersheba in fear.<a name=233:18></a> The very term "the well of the oath" reminds us how God has engaged Himself to look after us and take care of us, but Elijah laid down in the wilderness of Beersheba in fear.<a name=233:19></a> He

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=258:10></a> Well, it is important, but it is a question whether ecstasy is understood.<a name=258:11></a> In Peter's case he took advantage of the time of a meal, which would be a comparatively short time, but he would use it, going to the housetop to pray, and then the ecstasy comes; and the Spirit of God would help us on those lines.<a name=258:12></a> The sabbath keeping is essential to wholesome ministry, not that we could expect to have as much time available for sabbath keeping as is indicated in the types, for that would mean, that as in Israel, well nigh a quarter of the time available in ordinary life would be spent in sabbath keeping.<a name=258:13></a> We can learn, no doubt from God Himself, who is the first to be spoken of as keeping sabbath -- resting on the seventh day, and being refreshed.<a name=258:14></a> It is not only the ease that accrues, the comfort, or rest, but the refreshment, for we are apt to grow weary in one line of thought, and refreshment helps us and fits us for continuance in service.<a name=258:15></a>

		J.T.<a name=259:1></a> That agrees with what has been said as to the extended imprisonment of the apostle which afforded much that fitted him peculiarly for the great service of writing these epistles.<a name=259:2></a> In this epistle, Ephesians, it is a question of the counsels of God, and the love of God in these counsels, for the first chapter is a question of love at home as we might say, love in its own sphere, and the apostle was ready for that.<a name=259:3></a>

		J.T.<a name=260:2></a> Well, I find that very definitely, and the strain becomes onerous at times, so that the person becomes perhaps unfit for the more exalted service of ministry.<a name=260:3></a> Spirituality is a prime thought with God in the ministry, and hence <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:15">1 Corinthians  2:15</a> enlarges on the spiritual; "the spiritual discerns all things, and <i>he</i> is discerned of no one".<a name=260:4></a> In <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#5:23">1 Timothy  5:23</a>, there is a suggestion of stimulation, in view of certain demands made on Timothy.<a name=260:5></a> Paul says that he was not to partake in other's sins.<a name=260:6></a> The sins of some go before, and of others follow after, and in between these remarks, he makes the suggestion of the need of stimulation.<a name=260:7></a> Paul says "use a little wine".<a name=260:8></a> <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#5:23">1 Timothy  5:23</a>.<a name=260:9></a> I am not saying this in any sense to encourage the use of wine, but only to bring out how thoughtful God is, in view of his service, and how we have to think of the character of the service, so as not to attempt what we are unequal to, because of want of time and rest.<a name=260:10></a> We should seek to make time, so that we may be more available for the higher levels of service.<a name=260:11></a>

		J.T.<a name=274:1></a> Our inquiry this morning extended to chapter 1:14, so that there are other important points in the chapter to consider.<a name=274:2></a> First the apostle's personal consideration for the Ephesians which, it will be discerned, is important as we transfer the thoughts to ourselves, and we see the need of this personal consideration for brethren; it may be brethren at a distance or those nearby, or consideration called forth by some calamity or trouble.<a name=274:3></a> The spirit of Scripture would encourage this personal consideration for brethren.<a name=274:4></a> <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:15">Ephesians  1:15</a>,16 says, "Wherefore <i>I</i> also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is in you, and the love which ye have towards all the saints, do not cease giving thanks for you, making mention of you at my prayers", showing how ministers may become of general comfort through personal interest and solicitations, and it may be through affording physical relief.<a name=274:5></a> Hence christianity becomes what is, in fact, never otherwise than practical.<a name=274:6></a> The apostle's mind then runs on to certain features that entered into the moment, features which the Ephesians needed to include in their thoughts; such as the calling, and the power of God working in them, and above all the personal distinction and glory accruing to the Lord Jesus Himself, which must ever eclipse all else.<a name=274:7></a> It is especially seen here as the apostle uses such strength of language, as in verse 20, in which you find the work of God.<a name=274:8></a> He says, speaking of God's power "in which he wrought in the Christ in raising him from among the dead, and he set him down at his right hand in the heavenlies, above every principality, and authority, and power and dominion, and every name named, not only in this age, but also in that to come; and has put all things under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the assembly, which is his body, the fulness of him who fills all in all".<a name=274:9></a> <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:20">Ephesians  1:20</a> - 23.<a name=274:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=307:7></a> Well, the mystery in this chapter is spoken of in verse 2, "that by revelation the mystery has been made known to me", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:3">Ephesians  3:3</a>, and then this runs on down to verse 8, "To me, less than the least of all saints, has this grace been given, to announce among the nations the glad tidings of the unsearchable riches of the Christ, and to enlighten all with the knowledge of what is the administration of the mystery hidden throughout the ages in God, who has created all things, in order that now to the principalities and authorities in the heavenlies might be made known through the assembly the all-various wisdom of God, according to the purpose of the ages, which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord".<a name=307:8></a> <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:8">Ephesians  3:8</a> - 11.<a name=307:9></a> Now that is the mystery that is in mind in this chapter, but in chapter 5:32, it is said, "This mystery is great, but <i>I</i> speak as to Christ, and as to the assembly".<a name=307:10></a> <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:32">Ephesians  5:32</a>.<a name=307:11></a> As I understand chapter 5 he alludes specifically to the marital side as entering into the truth of the assembly, the allusion being to <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2">Genesis  2</a>, and carried down in the Lord showing to the disciples His hands and His side.<a name=307:12></a> The allusion there is to the formation of Eve, typifying the assembly as out of Christ, as of Christ, and therefore the thought of union enters into it.<a name=307:13></a> We have to bear in mind what in chapter 3 is indicated in the word mystery; "the revelation of the mystery", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#61:25">Romans  61:25</a>, are the words Paul uses, and then his remark in Chapter 5, "This mystery is great, but I speak as to Christ, and as to the assembly".<a name=307:14></a> <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:32">Ephesians  5:32</a>.<a name=307:15></a> So that

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=308:14></a> I think it is more general, that is to say, as composed of Jew and gentile.<a name=308:15></a> Whereas chapter 5 alludes to <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2">Genesis  2</a>and, as was remarked, to what the Lord said as He rose from the dead, when He showed the disciples His hands and His side; the allusion would be to His love for the assembly as having come out of Him, as Eve was taken out of Adam.<a name=308:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Ques</i>.<a name=308:17></a> Would the mystery be in connection with the assembly's relation to God in chapter 3, and in relation to Christ in chapter 5?<a name=308:18></a> The all-various wisdom of God is in chapter 3.<a name=308:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=308:20></a> Well, I think that is right, in a general way, because in chapter 3 the word is, "that they who are of the nations should be joint heirs, and a joint body, and joint partakers of His promise in Christ Jesus by the glad tidings", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:6">Ephesians  3:6</a>, whereas in chapter 5, the mystery alludes to Christ viewed as coming out of death, and the assembly as coming out of Christ.<a name=308:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Ques</i>.<a name=308:22></a> When you make a distinction between the truth of the mystery in a general sense, and the marital side, have you in mind that the marital side involves what is between Christ and the assembly exclusively; whereas when you speak of union in a general sense as fitting into the truth, it is the divine pleasure secured in the man and the woman together?<a name=308:23></a>

		<i>Rem</i>.<a name=309:3></a> The divine pleasure I meant, God's part, God's pleasure in it.<a name=309:4></a> I do not think we have made sufficient distinction in our minds between the two sides.<a name=309:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=309:6></a> Well, that has been before me, too.<a name=309:7></a> I am not sure that there is just time for it this morning, because it requires more time, and maybe more power to open it up; the subject is extremely important, especially as it has to do with the service of God in its present provisional setting.<a name=309:8></a> I am not sure that we are just equal to it now, but what we have had has been enough to go on with at the moment; namely, that chapter 3 is the general thought, the more general thought of the assembly as bearing on the general testimony of God.<a name=309:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=309:10></a> Would that be why the thought of families is introduced in this chapter, in verse 15, "of whom every family in the heavens and on earth is named"?<a name=309:11></a> <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:15">Ephesians  3:15</a>.<a name=309:12></a> Do the families fit in more with the general side of the testimony of God?<a name=309:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=309:14></a> That is right, I would say.<a name=309:15></a> And so the prayer governing that, the prayer of this chapter as compared with the prayer of chapter 1: in this chapter it refers to the Father and the many families.<a name=309:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.L.<a name=310:9></a> Would that not find support in the Lord's own utterance, "In my Father's house there are many abodes", <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:2">John  14:2</a>, each family taking its place in its own appointed abode in the way it has apprehended Christ, the Father's house being an eternal thought?<a name=310:10></a> But the Lord at once passes on to the <i>you</i>, "I go to prepare <i>you</i> a place", <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:2">John  14:2</a>, is Paul doing likewise here?<a name=310:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=310:12></a> Quite so.<a name=310:13></a> In that sense, the Father's house in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>, corresponds with what we are dealing with here, in both cases the idea of the many is left open; we have to find instruction as to it elsewhere.<a name=310:14></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>says, "I go to prepare you a place; and if I go", "I am coming again, and shall receive you to myself, that where I am <i>ye</i> also may be".<a name=310:15></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:2">John  14:2</a>,3.<a name=310:16></a> It does not extend beyond the saints at that time, and so here, the instruction does not extend beyond the assembly; the doxology is the real terminus of the chapter in that sense.<a name=310:17></a> "But to him that is able to do far exceedingly above all which we ask or

		F.J.<a name=311:4></a>F.<a name=311:5></a> Would it be right to say, the light of the Father having come out, that in some way that knowledge shines throughout all the families; God is known as Father?<a name=311:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=311:7></a> Well, I think that is right, and chapter 1, of course, in our epistle, would mean that Christ is over them all, He is set over all things to the assembly.<a name=311:8></a> He is Head over all things to the assembly.<a name=311:9></a> The assembly is included in the headship; what the Lord is doing as Head over all things, the assembly has part in.<a name=311:10></a> So that we do well to keep to the subject of the assembly in this epistle.<a name=311:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Ques</i>.<a name=311:12></a> Would the reference to the other families, both in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>and here, be to provide a sort of background to bring out the distinctive place of the assembly, that there is nothing else to compare with it?<a name=311:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=311:14></a> Well, and all else will be affected by it, it is the capital of the universe really, and all light I would say goes out through it.<a name=311:15></a> At the same time other families have their own distinction, and it enriches the idea of the Father to say that He has them.<a name=311:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.H.<a name=311:17></a>H.<a name=311:18></a> Is the distinction of the assembly borne out by what is said in verse 19, "that ye may be filled even to all the fulness of God".<a name=311:19></a> <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:19">Ephesians  3:19</a>.<a name=311:20></a> Would you say a little about the adequacy of the assembly in that relation?<a name=311:21></a>

		J.T.<a name=312:1></a> Well, I think the preposition <i>in</i> as we have often remarked, implies power, that the position is in power, and it bears on the service of God just as we have been saying.<a name=312:2></a> This chapter bears on the service of God, as does chapter 5, only here in chapter 3 it is more in relation to the general position of the assembly.<a name=312:3></a> It is the place it will occupy in the universe, I would think, but in the service of God "in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages".<a name=312:4></a> <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:21">Ephesians  3:21</a>.<a name=312:5></a> That is a remarkable expression, which I suppose means eternity, the special place that the assembly has in the service of God in eternal ages.<a name=312:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=312:10></a> Quite so, everything is there for the moment, I would say, and it is a provisional moment too, that is another thing to bear in mind, that the service of God is in a provisional situation now; but this closing passage regards it in its universal setting, "the assembly in Christ Jesus, unto all generations of the age of ages".<a name=312:11></a> <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:21">Ephesians  3:21</a>.<a name=312:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=312:16></a> I would say so, it is an expression often used as to position, and the position of the assembly is designated in that way, but it implies power.<a name=312:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		J.T.<a name=350:6></a> To be concise, there are three things that may be mentioned.<a name=350:7></a> The first is the Lord's brethren according to <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>, and the second is the assembly according to <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5">Ephesians  5</a>, and the third is the sons of God, spoken of in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>.<a name=350:8></a> Now the thought that has been often expressed, at least by myself, is that these three items may be regarded as three phases of the same group of persons.<a name=350:9></a> The first phase is the brethren of Christ, according to <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>, and the second the assembly, in its peculiar relations with Christ, wifely or marital relations with Christ, and the third is the sons of God; all three running on to eternity.<a name=350:10></a> The passage in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3">Ephesians  3</a>, treated of yesterday, points to what we call eternity; "all generations of the age of ages".<a name=350:11></a> <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:21">Ephesians  3:21</a>.<a name=350:12></a> It is the nearest thought to it, I would say, that our minds can take in.<a name=350:13></a> It develops out of the position of Deity; that is, "the fulness of God", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:19">Ephesians  3:19</a>, and the thought of Deity in Christ whose love surpasses knowledge.<a name=350:14></a> These great thoughts enter into the doxology at the end of chapter 3, as it is said "to him be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages.<a name=350:15></a> Amen".<a name=350:16></a> <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:21">Ephesians  3:21</a>.<a name=350:17></a> That position would include the three items spoken of, besides the divine Persons, of course.<a name=350:18></a> Certain things have been said that would seem to clash with what I am saying, but what I am saying I have said many times, and said it in Croydon nine months ago, although it was not as clear to me as it is now, and I hope the brethren will see that as far as I am concerned, it is what I understand to enter into the Lord's supper, and that we should be free in using these terms, the spiritual import of which lead to the highest altitudes in the service of God.<a name=350:19></a>

		J.T.<a name=359:13></a> Yes, I think the conditions, normal conditions were there; the saints were all together in one place as the Spirit came in, and hence Peter was free to set out the gospel as it should be set out, with the proper background to it.<a name=359:14></a>

		J.T.<a name=394:1></a> Luke, the writer of this book, refers back to the Lord's coming to His own after He rose, and says, "to whom also he presented himself living".<a name=394:2></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:3">Acts  1:3</a> The word is <i>presented Himself</i>.<a name=394:3></a> The word presented is not found in the records of the appearings of the Lord as given in the gospels.<a name=394:4></a> There is the thought in it of the Lord having in mind that He should be seen in a certain way by them, and seen alive, or living, as if the Lord would indicate something as to life in some form or attitude, that would impress the saints and enter into the service of God in which He has part, the Lord's supper being the centre of it.<a name=394:5></a> We have to compare this with what has been read in chapter 13, as to eternal life and the reference to life in a physical sense in Eutychus, evidently pointing to life in a moral sense as entering into the celebration of the Lord's supper.<a name=394:6></a> Another thing to be noted is the word <i>assembled</i>, used twice in this chapter.<a name=394:7></a> It is not the usual word for assembly, but still it carries the same thought, and refers to what is requisite or customary, certainly requisite for the Lord's supper.<a name=394:8></a>

		Life, as indicated in chapter 13, would be eternal life in the ordinary sense running on to the millennium, but it would also involve what is now known in the Spirit whilst we are here in flesh and blood.<a name=394:9></a> And then, the state Eutychus was in, would be a flesh and blood state, although he was resuscitated or raised.<a name=394:10></a> It is said that he "was taken up dead", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20:9">Acts  20:9</a>, as if death had actually happened, and yet Paul says, "Be not troubled, for his life is in him".<a name=394:11></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20:10">Acts  20:10</a>.<a name=394:12></a> Life in a boy is a thought that needs to be kept in mind as to life, entering into the provisional circumstances at the present time.<a name=394:13></a> We shall see that life, in these senses, should have a prominent place in the service of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=395:7></a> I would say that, and especially in view of Judaism.<a name=395:8></a> Matthew has in mind the gradual, though not immediate, disappearance of Judaism, and hence the thought of the living God, the Son of the living God.<a name=395:9></a> It is a living system, instead of a dead system as m Judaism.<a name=395:10></a>

		J.P.<a name=395:11></a>H.<a name=395:12></a> I was thinking too of <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:1">Revelation  3:1</a>, the word to Sardis, "I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead".<a name=395:13></a> Are you encouraging living conditions and life in the assembly in contrast to all that is around?<a name=395:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=395:15></a> Just so; "thou", "art dead".<a name=395:16></a> <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:1">Revelation  3:1</a>.<a name=395:17></a> It confirms what has been remarked as to Judaism.<a name=395:18></a> The present situation of the profession of christianity is similar to Judaism, as the book of the Acts contemplates, and is finally confirmed in the letter to the Hebrews by Paul; hence the presentation of the Lord <i>Himself living</i> is, as already said, suggestive and points to a living order of things in our meetings and services.<a name=395:19></a>

		J.T.<a name=395:22></a> Well, that is the idea in mind, but death would be implied.<a name=395:23></a> Life in the millennium will evidently be on earth in men, in flesh and blood; only, Satan being bound, sin will be weakened, but still it is there, and the Spirit of God is there too in some sense, maintaining such conditions as are illustrated in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#29">Numbers  29</a>in the feast of tabernacles, where there is steady decrease, but not below what might be called the proper level for life,

		I was going to remark that the book of Acts contemplates the gradual disappearance of Judaism, and hence we may say, the gradual but sure disappearance of christendom as it is.<a name=396:2></a> So that, before the final adjustment by the introduction of Paul and Barnabas, especially of Paul himself, the state of christendom as corresponding with Judaism is indicated in the death of Herod, who arose, according to chapter 12, and slew James with the sword and endeavoured to slay Peter, but he was eaten with worms.<a name=396:3></a> It was a terrible comment and judgment too on the system of Judaism at that time, but the work of God went on, and liberty was afforded to Paul and Barnabas, particularly Paul, the Spirit taking him on, after Barnabas left him, so as to carry out the divine thoughts in christianity.<a name=396:4></a> I suppose we may reckon that God will intervene in some way <i>if</i> things become worse, and if any attack is made on the general position of christianity, He will weaken the efforts of the enemy; hindering it, but weakening it, so that the service of God may continue.<a name=396:5></a> The second treatise of Luke is intended to lead into christianity proper, though to some extent still recognising Judaism, which gradually disappears.<a name=396:6></a> The thought was that we might see how primarily life such as we have spoken of attaches to the service of God.<a name=396:7></a>

		J.T.<a name=397:20></a> I should think that is very encouraging to look into, although these remarks, as they come, cannot be pursued in each case, because the idea of these meetings, is to take on whatever comes out that will help peculiarly at the moment.<a name=397:21></a> The disciples contemplated His glory, we are told, showing that the Lord was not only to be spoken of, but to be contemplated.<a name=397:22></a> We cannot depend altogether on what is said, but we may rely too on what is contemplated, what we are able to take on, as we are lying fallow and taking on the truth, so that it gives character to us.<a name=397:23></a> We are to keep our sabbaths.<a name=397:24></a>

		J.T.<a name=400:4></a> Well, that is in keeping with what we are saying.<a name=400:5></a> "Forty" is used in scripture in the sense of a complete period of testing something.<a name=400:6></a> This reference is quite in keeping; "to whom also he presented himself living, after he had suffered, with many proofs; being seen by them during forty days, and speaking of the things which concern the kingdom of God"; <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:3">Acts  1:3</a>.<a name=400:7></a> So that the forty days, somewhat less than seven weeks, would point to the Lord's consideration of the whole position, giving the opportunity for the completion of what was incomplete when He arose, because Matthew, and Mark particularly, stress the fact that the saints were in a very poor way when the Lord rose and appeared to them at first.<a name=400:8></a> The Lord knew what was there; He knew what He had effected, and the sequel showed that the unbelief was just superficial.<a name=400:9></a> The Lord knew that the real thing was there in every one of them, and He allowed time to bring that out, what He had effected Himself, making due allowance for recovery with all, before the Holy Spirit was sent down.<a name=400:10></a> I believe it is a matter of great importance, the Lord's consideration for what He has effected in His own before the Holy Spirit came down, and <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>, particularly from the 15th verse, is to bring out what was there.<a name=400:11></a> "Peter, standing up in the midst of the brethren, said", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:15">Acts  1:15</a>, And then we are told that the crowd of names was about one hundred and twenty; the names meaning there was life in them.<a name=400:12></a> Then what Peter says is to be noted.<a name=400:13></a> "It is necessary therefore, that of the men who have assembled with us all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us, beginning from the baptism of John until the day in which he was taken up from us, one of these should be a witness with us of his resurrection".<a name=400:14></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:21">Acts  1:21</a>,22.<a name=400:15></a> It will be seen that Peter is very far advanced on what he was when presented to us first after the Lord rose; and the Lord intended that it should be

		The apostle Paul speaks of the mystery of piety, which leads on to what I have been saying, for piety is essential to our understanding of the truth, not mere learning as men speak, but the learning of piety.<a name=503:3></a> And so the apostle writes to Timothy so that he or anyone should know how to behave himself in the house of God, "which is the assembly of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3:15">1 Timothy  3:15</a>.<a name=503:4></a> And then "the mystery of piety (or godliness) is great.<a name=503:5></a> God has been manifested in flesh, has been justified in the Spirit, has appeared to angels, has been preached among the nations, has been believed on in the world, has been received up in glory", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3:16">1 Timothy  3:16</a>.<a name=503:6></a> That is a passage that indicates peculiarly what I have in mind; it was written to a young man, one who laboured with Paul and of whom Paul said that he had no one like him, in that he cared with genuine feeling how the saints got on.<a name=503:7></a> Hence we may understand that Paul in writing about the truth to his child in the faith, Timotheus, would not fail to include the thought of mystery; not only the mystery of the assembly, but the thought of mystery otherwise seen.<a name=503:8></a> As christians, we should not be content to be, as it were, ordinary, for we have what the world has not, and what it does not know, and cannot know.<a name=503:9></a> The natural mind of man cannot know the things

		of God, for they are foolishness to him, but the believer can know.<a name=504:1></a> Indeed, what the apostle says, concerning our minds, is to show that we have not ordinary ones; we have the physical faculty involved in thinking, even as all men have, more or less, but "<i>we</i> have the mind of Christ", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:16">1 Corinthians  2:16</a>.<a name=504:2></a> Christians, therefore, are capable of taking in things according to that mind, and speak of them and think of them according to it; which is an immense matter for us.<a name=504:3></a> "We have the mind of Christ", (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:16">1 Corinthians  2:16</a>) which involves the kind of thinking faculty that Christ has.<a name=504:4></a> So we can understand how we can rise above the ordinary level in treating of matters; even if they be ordinary matters we can treat of them differently to natural men.<a name=504:5></a> Our minds are different, and not only different, but holy, and pure.<a name=504:6></a> These are words used in designating the mind of the believer, as Peter says, "stir up your pure minds", <a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#3:1">2 Peter  3:1</a>.<a name=504:7></a> He said that, as he was about to put off his tabernacle; that is, about to die.<a name=504:8></a> He wished to stir up the pure minds of the Jewish christians, for his ministry was to the Jews, as Paul's was to the gentiles.<a name=504:9></a> Not that either was confined to his particular ministry, because Paul ministered to the Jews, he wrote the epistle to the Hebrews undoubtedly, and Peter ministered to the gentiles too.<a name=504:10></a> So that they were not bound to their respective ministries, they were free, as Christ had set them free, in intelligence; they would know what to do, as the need for ministry arose.<a name=504:11></a>

		The thought before me is that our minds should become accustomed, if not so already, to move on higher levels.<a name=504:12></a> As I was saying, Peter speaks of our "pure minds", and hence regards them as above the ordinary way of dealing with matters.<a name=504:13></a> We need to avoid letting things out that are sacred and holy, allowing them to run in the current of the natural mind.<a name=504:14></a> We see the result of this in Samson, a remarkable servant, I need not say, but one marked by looseness in his service.<a name=504:15></a> The Spirit of God moved him, we are told, in the camp of Dan, which

		was his camp, for he belonged to the tribe of Dan; the Spirit of God moved him, which is something that every young brother and sister ought to know, at least, to some degree; to know what it is to be moved by the Spirit of God.<a name=505:1></a> The first move is never to be forgotten, when you are consciously moved by the Spirit of God, you will desire another and another, and so, as I said, Samson was stirred or moved, very powerfully too, we are told, in his own camp, the camp of Daniel Much, of course, could be said of him, but I am referring to him now rather to show what should be avoided, and that is looseness of thought and speech, and the tendency of being drawn under the influence of the natural mind.<a name=505:2></a> It was his wife (it is a question whether she ever became his wife actually, but she is called his wife) that influenced him considerably for seven days, because he had uttered a riddle which was a mystery.<a name=505:3></a> As I have said before, such things, that is, mysteries are not to be scarce with us, or wholly absent with any of us.<a name=505:4></a> We should certainly know something about mysteries, the mysteries of God, and if we do know, we should be careful that we do not speak of them in a natural sense and make them the subject of ordinary conversation, for we shall in doing so cause damage by thus reducing them to what is just ordinary, whereas the things of God are not ordinary.<a name=505:5></a>

		Samson, as I said, allowed himself to be influenced by his wife; it was in regard to some thirty garments, or shirts.<a name=505:6></a> The matter was of small consequence, in one sense, and yet in the eyes of the Philistines of much consequence, showing what the natural man is, old and young.<a name=505:7></a> The Philistines threatened to burn her father's house and her too, if she dared not to disclose what Samson's riddle meant.<a name=505:8></a> She eventually came into possession of the secret, and saved her life and her father's life for the moment, but Samson was lost through disclosing the secret.<a name=505:9></a> He made a precious thing a common thing, which we, as I said before, should

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I wish to work out the thought of companionship into the great matter of fellowship.<a name=506:8></a> Fellowship is a word that has acquired a great place among spiritual people, a place that it hardly has at all among unspiritual people, and now that it has acquired this place, the thing is to develop it, and see to it that we have suitable companionship.<a name=506:9></a> Daniel had companions; he was one of a number, but they are called his companions, and I would now speak to young ones here, and urge the importance of spiritual companionship.<a name=506:10></a> If you are to rise to these spiritual levels of which I have spoken, you must have spiritual companions; they too rising with you to the level to which we are called.<a name=506:11></a> Paul, as it is said of him,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I speak now of the thing that I have already spoken of, the importance of spiritual companionship, and the keeping with it, not getting below it, but even getting above it.<a name=507:7></a> If you set the pace, God will help you, and maintain it; because it is a question of purity and holiness, involving intelligence.<a name=507:8></a> So, as I was saying, as to Daniel, it is said that "the decree went forth that the wise men were to be slainThen Daniel answered with counsel and prudence to Arioch the chief of the king's guard, who had gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon; he answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why is the decree so rigorous from the king?<a name=507:9></a> Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel", <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#2:13">Daniel  2:13</a> - 15.<a name=507:10></a> This is what I wanted to read, dear brethren -- "And Daniel went in, and requested of the king that he would give him time, and that he might shew the king the interpretation.<a name=507:11></a> Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions", <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#2:16">Daniel  2:16</a>,17.<a name=507:12></a> I want you now, dear brethren, to follow this, as I am seeking in a simple way to bring before us what is

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am urging attention to what one man may do, or can do, under God, and what his companions and he, by themselves, can do, not only he himself but with his companions, so God has given us companions.<a name=508:7></a> The companions are the brethren; these companions are Christ's too; He calls them His companions; He is anointed with "the oil of gladness above thy companions", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:9">Hebrews  1:9</a>.<a name=508:8></a> You can see what is involved in the Lord Jesus and His companions, and so as it works down to any one of us, and our companions.<a name=508:9></a> It is for us to consider how much we are making of each other, because, to speak plainly and simply, God needs us, He needs every one of us.<a name=508:10></a> He can do things, of course, as He did in the creation, by Himself, but what He is doing now is not by Himself.<a name=508:11></a> You will understand what I mean.<a name=508:12></a> God has established a system in the universe, and He has established a Head to it; the headship of Christ is involved in it, and the Spirit of God is involved in it, and not only are the divine Persons needed in it, but to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Daniel, we are told, "went to his house and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions; that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows" or companions "should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon", <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#2:17">Daniel  2:17</a>,18.<a name=509:4></a> I hardly need repeat what I have said, that terrible things are being developed, on the principle of unionism, of systematised unionism.<a name=509:5></a> Labour is put on the top of everything.<a name=509:6></a> I say that advisedly, and where are we going to be?<a name=509:7></a> What is to become of us, dear brethren?<a name=509:8></a> Unless we have recourse to this matter of christian companionship, and the absolute refusal of what the devil is building up, we will be down, down and down to miry clay.<a name=509:9></a> Whatever men may say about it, I am saying what I know to be so, and it is put to us to refuse the companionship that is abroad in this world.<a name=509:10></a> On the other hand, God has those that are His own.<a name=509:11></a> We read of the Lord Jesus, having "his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end", <a href="../bible/John.htm#13:1">John  13:1</a>.<a name=509:12></a> However few, He loved them to the end, and He is going to love them still.<a name=509:13></a> He is loving us still, but He is looking for what I am saying.<a name=509:14></a> He has His companions, He has made His selection, He is securing those whom He will regard as His companions, and He is looking for us all to be in that circle.<a name=509:15></a> Of Daniel it is said that he asked his companions to "desire mercies of the God of the heavens concerning this secret", <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#2:18">Daniel  2:18</a>.<a name=509:16></a>

		Now this secret is what I am speaking of; it is what is in the fellowship, what belongs to Christ's companions, what is involved in the mystery; as over against the mystery of iniquity there is the mystery of piety.<a name=510:1></a> There is the mystery called "the assembly", the mystery of God, the mystery of Christ; these are outstanding facts, that we have part in, and it is a question of what use we are making of the part we have in them, and whether we recognise the possibility of overcoming; that is, of keeping the secret, keeping the truth in the sense of mystery; not parading it abroad, as men will, but keeping it in a holy sense, a mysterious sense, and keeping it within the confines of the companionship to which we are called.<a name=510:2></a> And so, as I said, Daniel and his companions "desired mercies of the God of the heavens concerning this secret, that Daniel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon", <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#2:18">Daniel  2:18</a>.<a name=510:3></a> It is a question of a secret, and how we are holding the thing in the fellowship; is it according to God?<a name=510:4></a> It is the fellowship of God's Son.<a name=510:5></a> Let us think of the magnificence of that.<a name=510:6></a> It is the fellowship of His death, and it is the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.<a name=510:7></a> These are the three great fellowships spoken of in the two letters to Corinth, and we are all in them, dear brethren.<a name=510:8></a> But the point is, what we are making of them, with the end in view that we defeat what the devil is doing.<a name=510:9></a> Not that we should set out to be in any public way against what is current in the world but to hold the secret of the thing, to hold it in holiness, as having part in it.<a name=510:10></a> As a result of the desires of Daniel and his companions, "Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision.<a name=510:11></a> Then Daniel blessed the God of the heavens", <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#2:19">Daniel  2:19</a>.<a name=510:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I am endeavouring to bring home to every one what is available and possible in the fellowship, and in the companionship into which we are brought by the Spirit of God; and so I venture to add a word as to the passage in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3:16">1 Corinthians  3:16</a> - 17.<a name=512:5></a> "Do ye not know that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?<a name=512:6></a> If any one corrupt the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, and such are ye".<a name=512:7></a> The present form of the temple, which is a provisional form, will presently be changed into a holy temple in the Lord; it is going to be changed into that.<a name=512:8></a> Now it is a temple, and in the sense in which our attention is called to it here, it is holy, that in which secrets are told and revealed, and as brethren moving together in the fellowship, we come into the idea of temple, not only the fellowship, but the temple.<a name=512:9></a> "Ye are the temple of God", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3:16">1 Corinthians  3:16</a>.<a name=512:10></a> The temple implies what is holy, it implies the secrets of God.<a name=512:11></a> The secrets of God are with them that fear Him, and it is within our reach to know these secrets of God, and promote what is meant in the idea of the temple as in 1 Corinthians.<a name=512:12></a> It is a present thing, but I might say hardly used, and the reference to it in 1 Corinthians indicates that the brethren there were hardly capable of working out the idea of the temple.<a name=512:13></a> The apostle has to say, "Do ye not know that ye are the temple of God"?<a name=512:14></a> <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3:16">1 Corinthians  3:16</a>.<a name=512:15></a> You can hardly think that they had worked it out in their Bible readings, where it should be

		As I said, the time has come now, in the history of the testimony, for love to appear.<a name=534:4></a> It is the twenty-first chapter of Exodus, it begins the section reaching to chapter 24.<a name=534:5></a> I say that because of the importance of the detail furnished in those chapters, leading up to the actual journey taken by Israel under the angel at the hand of God.<a name=534:6></a> The time had come now, in chapter 21, for love to show itself, and that is what is in mind to call attention to, that there is someone who has love, and that one is no less than the Lord Jesus.<a name=534:7></a> It is the Lord Jesus typically, and one never ceases to give thanks to God for the typical teaching of Scripture, how it fits into the christian doctrine.<a name=534:8></a> The typical teaching here is of the Lord Jesus Christ, He says plainly, I <i>love</i>, "I love my master, my wife, and my children", (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#21:5">Exodus  21:5</a>) and it adds to that (giving the declaration its peculiar force), "I will not go out free".<a name=534:9></a> In other words, the type goes to the limit of the testimony of love.<a name=534:10></a> As the scripture says, if we have not love we are nothing, but if we have, we are known in heaven.<a name=534:11></a> I am certain of that.<a name=534:12></a> So here it is not something said in a whisper; it is not a drawing room matter, something that might be whispered among special friends, but something plainly spoken.<a name=534:13></a> If we tell our brethren that we have love, and we are not walking in it, then the brethren do not believe us.<a name=534:14></a> This need of love comes up constantly in matters that have to be dealt with.<a name=534:15></a> It is a precious thought that the brethren have love.<a name=534:16></a> I am speaking now in a general sense, I might say in the abstract sense, in saying that.<a name=534:17></a> The testimony to what we are ourselves each one, is in this that we love the brethren; "we have passed from death to life", (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:14">1 John  3:14</a>) if we

		I have in mind to speak of man, as inclusive of man and woman; that is, male and female; and I have selected this verse in 2 Corinthians with a view to speaking of woman, because the epistles to Corinth enlarge on her; they enlarge on her in the sense in which they enlarge on other things also; that is, in the abstract sense.<a name=541:1></a> The first chapter of the first epistle deals with the truth in an abstract way, a way found elsewhere in both epistles, because it enables the Spirit of God to deal with truth, not as practically expressed, practically carried out, but with a view to basing other things on it; as, for instance, the principle of gift.<a name=541:2></a> The apostle says, "Ye come short in no gift", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:7">1 Corinthians  1:7</a>.<a name=541:3></a> This can only be understood abstractly; and so, with other passages and things, as for instance, the question of leaven; "Purge out the old leaven", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5:7">1 Corinthians  5:7</a>.<a name=541:4></a> That is not abstract, but alas, very concrete, especially at Corinth, the city that was famed for its wickedness, for its looseness, and so it was to be purged out; the apostle afforded the means judicially of purging it out, at least, in one person, an incestuous person, who was put away.<a name=541:5></a> But then the apostle says, in aging or directing them to purge out the old leaven, "that ye may be a new lump, according <i>as ye are unleavened</i>", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5:7">1 Corinthians  5:7</a>.<a name=541:6></a> That is what I mean by abstract, and it is found throughout the first epistle, and the second too, and I believe the very passage I have read involves it, because the condition of the Corinthians hardly afforded much of a concrete nature in the way of chastity; whereas the apostle had in mind to treat of the brethren at Corinth, men and women, as a unit; they were to be presented to Christ.<a name=541:7></a> Indeed he had done this.<a name=541:8></a> He said, "I have

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is solemn and sorrowful that there should be any such thing in an assembly of God; and yet the gathering at Corinth is called an assembly of God; specifically called "the assembly of God which is in Corinth", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:2">1 Corinthians  1:2</a>.<a name=542:4></a> There was serious evil, as I said, but it was not overlooked or condoned; the apostle had in mind to deal with it, and in view of doing so he was waiting on the Corinthians so that they might judge themselves.<a name=542:5></a> They had judged themselves to a considerable extent, but not wholly, and therefore he waited, showing how patient God is with His people.<a name=542:6></a> Paul says therefore, "having in readiness to avenge all disobedience when your obedience shall have been fulfilled", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#10:6">2 Corinthians  10:6</a>.<a name=542:7></a> He does not spare them; he was ready to avenge all disobedience.<a name=542:8></a> Therefore when their obedience was fulfilled, and doubtless it was in measure, then the wickedness undoubtedly would be driven out.<a name=542:9></a>

		Now, having said so much, with a view to the clarification of my subject, I turn to the passage in Genesis, in order to point out the need of the feminine side of the truth being present substantially.<a name=542:10></a> It was really scarce at Corinth; I mean the true character of the female was not much in evidence, and it may be so today, amongst the brethren; there may be a scarcity of the feminine, in the true sense.<a name=542:11></a> I am thinking of it only in the true sense, and so I refer to <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>to bring out my point, and to show

		The first passage I read, speaks of leadership, the Lord's leadership, and I wish to speak of it, not in the ordinary sense of leadership; that is, of persons being led into new thoughts or regions, but led dispensationally, for that is indeed what the Lord did in leading His own out as far as to Bethany, "as far as".<a name=553:1></a> It was not very far, in a literal sense, only a few furlongs from Jerusalem, but in result it really meant that the Lord was leading dispensationally, as I said, and He stopped at Bethany.<a name=553:2></a> It was a remarkable time, and what led up to it, too, was remarkable, and indeed solemn, for the Lord had moved from the mountain called the mount of transfiguration.<a name=553:3></a> He had moved from that point, having been glorified there, and the movement was to Jerusalem, having in mind that it should be His exit out of this world, but through death; and so it happened.<a name=553:4></a> He was put to death according to the record of Peter's address, and also of <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#4">Acts  4</a>.<a name=553:5></a> It was a judicial matter, a most solemn, a most dreadful judicial matter.<a name=553:6></a>

		So the Lord did not say many words, He travelled away from Jerusalem to Bethany, and He served as priest, lifting up His hands as He was parted from them, He blessed them, as if to say that full assembly matters must be postponed for the moment.<a name=555:8></a> It was not to be thus for very long, for Paul was on the horizon, I might say; he was not far away, at least in the Lord's mind, and the Lord would wait for him too, for it was a waiting time for heaven, as well as for Israel; not yet for the gentiles, their waiting time would come.<a name=555:9></a> But the Lord was ready to wait.<a name=555:10></a> He was parted from them; how He would feel the parting, because one of them had lain in His bosom, and there would be a sense of separation.<a name=555:11></a> He was parted from <i>them</i>, not they parted from Him, because they remained, no doubt, in their proper attitude, but He was parted from them, and that has its own significance.<a name=555:12></a> Nevertheless, with all the partings, and all the vicissitudes that entered into that moment, the Lord was received up in glory, heaven was waiting to hail Him, "be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall come in", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#24:7">Psalm  24:7</a>.<a name=555:13></a> I quote that merely to convey the facts of the case.<a name=555:14></a> What an entry He had, what a welcome!<a name=555:15></a> The Father had already raised Him by His glory.<a name=555:16></a> Think of that; what an

		Now referring to the passage in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24">Luke  24</a>, He was <i>on the way</i> to the assembly dispensation, but He has now reached it, removing all the Jewish trammels attaching to it; so that it might stand out in its glory; that we might understand that we belong to a glorious dispensation, the most glorious of all, the one that will run into eternity.<a name=557:7></a> The Lord has, through His servant, Paul, taken up all these matters.<a name=557:8></a> I am going over ground that I have gone over already in recent times, though perhaps not in the ears of all here, but necessarily so, because I believe the brethren all need to see that christianity is unique in itself, and intended to be glorious in itself, and that the Lord has taken His journey to it, out of Judaism.<a name=557:9></a> He is not supporting Judaism now, not in any way, either spiritually, or commercially, or politically.<a name=557:10></a> He is not in it at all.<a name=557:11></a> He is out of it altogether.<a name=557:12></a> He is as free as we are, having set us free, and He is liberating His people from it, bringing them into "the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free", <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#5:1">Galatians  5:1</a>.<a name=557:13></a> That is the lesson for us.<a name=557:14></a> He has come to another dispensation and He is in it, and He is staying in it for the time, in order to get us all into it before we go to heaven.<a name=557:15></a> I am sure the Lord contemplates with grief seeing many of His own held with the trammels of religion, as it is called, whether it be paganism,

		Again referring to Adam, whilst Jehovah was saying nothing to him, Adam said something, which indicated that he was progressing, progressing in knowledge of God's creatures, but now of man, but man in its feminine feature, and he spoke to God about this.<a name=566:7></a> It is to be noted here that from <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2">Genesis  2</a>, God has a double name; 'Jehovah Elohim' is the designation, meaning that there is progress also in what God is bringing out, and pointing to progress even in God's sympathies and feelings towards man.<a name=566:8></a> It is not that God is like ourselves, learning; that could never be, one would not use that word at all as to God.<a name=566:9></a> It is said prophetically of the Lord Jesus, in anticipation of His coming into manhood condition, that His ear was opened as the learner.<a name=566:10></a> "The Lord Jehovah hath given me the tongue of the instructed, that I should know how to succour by a word him that is weary.<a name=566:11></a> He wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the instructed", <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#50:4">Isaiah  50:4</a>.<a name=566:12></a>

		I have alluded to, the book of Hosea; the prophet says, "and we shall know, -- we shall follow on to know Jehovah", <a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#6:3">Hosea  6:3</a>.<a name=567:1></a> Adam is not following on to know God exactly, but he is following on in the point in question, and he says to Jehovah Elohim, "this time", for he had had several times afforded to him to give expression to the knowledge that God gave him, and in which he was growing and developing, but now he says, "This time it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh: this shall be called Woman, because this was taken out of a man", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:23">Genesis  2:23</a>.<a name=567:2></a> You see how he is learning.<a name=567:3></a> I am noting all this that we might all be led on in learning, and it is to be hoped, that we shall not leave this hall at this time without having learned something, something more than we came in with, because there is something to be learned, even in the Scriptures as they are read.<a name=567:4></a>

		So as I said, there was progress as early as Adam, and then in Enoch, who is said to be "the seventh from Adam", <a href="../bible/Jude.htm#1:14">Jude  1:14</a>.<a name=567:5></a> We read of this in the book of Jude, and that Enoch prophesied.<a name=567:6></a> Adam did not prophesy, but Enoch did, and it is said of him that he was the seventh from Adam, not after Adam, because the idea is that he began with Adam, as a learner he saw there was something to be learned from God's great creature; that is, Adam.<a name=567:7></a> Enoch is "the seventh from Adam", (<a href="../bible/Jude.htm#1:14">Jude  1:14</a>) and if we analyse the matter we must begin with Seth, and those following after Seth, seven in all, and we shall see that we are in the very midst of progress, of spiritual progress.<a name=567:8></a> We are in the way of knowing things, and of acquiring knowledge that is necessary for us, even in the service of God, because it all culminates in the knowledge of God Himself.<a name=567:9></a> All must culminate in God, all begins with Him, it did not begin with Adam, knowledge began with God.<a name=567:10></a> And so Enoch was the seventh, and clearly had acquired more than his fellows, for he became a prophet, and it is said that "before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:5">Hebrews  11:5</a>.<a name=567:11></a> It is not said of Adam that he

		Well, now, I have spoken about Adam in the light of his progress, and now I go on to John, who presents much of this knowledge in the sense of progress, and what John says as to new birth illustrates it.<a name=568:6></a> It is a very important matter, and it is for each to inquire into his mind; I say into his mind, not into his heart now, but into his mind, to see whether he understands new birth, whether he is born anew.<a name=568:7></a> Some may assume that it is everything, that you can lock up in the idea of new birth the whole of christianity, and comfort yourself with the thought that everything is there, but that is a mistake; you will be ignorant if you do that, because the idea of progression is in it, and this is illustrated in the third chapter of John's gospel.<a name=568:8></a> Nicodemus said to the Lord, "We know that thou art come a teacher from God", <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:2">John  3:2</a>.<a name=568:9></a> Well, that was something, a very great matter too, to belong to a class of people who know.<a name=568:10></a> He was of the Pharisaic class, and yet <i>he</i> had some regard for God and for Christ, and so he can say to the Lord, "We know that thou art come a teacher from God, for none can

		Now I am not only saying that these things happened, but that there is progress involved, progress in the truth, and it is for each of us to see that even in that initial feature he has progressed.<a name=569:8></a> As we progress in it, it will be just a stepping stone to something else, and that something else is eternal life, and other truths of that kind, the great truth of redemption, the death of Christ, the resurrection of Christ, the ascension of Christ, the incoming of the Spirit, all these things are there basically, the basis is laid for them in the things I have spoken of.<a name=569:9></a> But as I said, new birth is the most initial thought of the whole system of truth; it begins with this, but there is a second thought as to it, which is necessary to make it clear, so that it becomes a part of the structure of truth of which Christ is the expression, for He is called the truth, "I am the way, the truth, and the life", <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:6">John  14:6</a>.<a name=569:10></a> The way is one thing, but then the truth is another, and then the life is still another, and the Lord, in order to indicate what I have been saying, spoke the second time to Nicodemus.<a name=569:11></a> Nicodemus asked the question, "How can a man be born being

		Now I come to the scripture read in <a href="../bible/John.htm#8">John  8</a>, which refers to liberty, and I want to show that the verses read are progressive, that we are to progress in liberty, otherwise we shall soon slip back into bondage; we shall soon forget that we are purged from our former sins.<a name=570:8></a> We must be going forward, and so it says here of the Lord, that "As he spoke these things many believed on him", <a href="../bible/John.htm#8:30">John  8:30</a>.<a name=570:9></a> One hopes that some are getting some little light in their souls now, for it is a time of light.<a name=570:10></a> Light is available, truth is available; and the Lord was speaking in His own divine way to those that were about Him, ever ready to instruct them, to afford help to men, and "As he spoke these things many believed on him", <a href="../bible/John.htm#8:30">John  8:30</a>.<a name=570:11></a> It does not say what they believed, but they believed on Him, which is a very general thought, and indeed in result meant progression, and we shall see, that unless we believe in a progressive sense we shall become dark again.<a name=570:12></a> If we settle down to any given system of truth, or any phase of the truth, and do not progress we shall become dark; we shall forget that we are purged from our former sins; but it is said here that "many believed on him", (<a href="../bible/John.htm#8:30">John  8:30</a>) as He spoke these things.<a name=570:13></a> It was wonderful speaking, <a href="../bible/John.htm#8">John  8</a>is one of the most wonderful parts of the Bible.<a name=570:14></a> It is a very long chapter, a very deep chapter, and you can understand how God was working and how many would believe on Him.<a name=570:15></a> It is hoped that some are believing now, because it is a progressive matter, and one hopes that we,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We should observe here that there is a question as to some of them, because there are disciples and disciples; some went back, you know, and some, we are told in the second chapter, believed only because of the signs, and the Lord did not trust them, which is a very searching matter, that the Lord maybe does not trust some of us here, we are not reliable, we are not going on, we are not progressing in the truth, and the Lord does not trust us.<a name=571:3></a> And so it was that He did not trust certain ones, because they only believed because of the signs.<a name=571:4></a> We need to believe on Him, in a greater sense than that, and so it is said here, "Jesus therefore said to the Jews who believed on him, If ye abide in my word, ye are truly my disciples; and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free", <a href="../bible/John.htm#8:31">John  8:31</a>,32.<a name=571:5></a> Now this is the great point that I have in mind as to progress.<a name=571:6></a> Many of them had believed on Him, but they were not free.<a name=571:7></a> And the Lord is testing them; He is testing us too, this very time, as to where we are, and as to how much we can be trusted as believers.<a name=571:8></a> And so the Lord is testing these listeners, and He says, "If ye abide in my word ye are truly my disciples", <a href="../bible/John.htm#8:31">John  8:31</a> The Lord would have true disciples; He is not looking for superficial disciples.<a name=571:9></a> Christendom is built up on those lines, and it is a question of numbers, but it is a spurious position, abhorrent to heaven.<a name=571:10></a> It is building up systems of men that are on unreliable grounds, on a sandy foundation, and hence the Lord would correct it.<a name=571:11></a> "And ye shall know the truth", He says, "and the truth shall set you free", <a href="../bible/John.htm#8:32">John  8:32</a>.<a name=571:12></a> The truth shall do it, and I shall hope to show that the Lord does it too, but the truth has that power.<a name=571:13></a>

		One of the most important truths that we have revived in these last days, while, of course, it was always in the Scriptures, and the great feature of John's gospel, is the truth relative to the Son of God.<a name=573:2></a> In his epistle, he says, "we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us an understanding that we should know him that is true; and we are in him that is true, in his Son Jesus Christ", and then, "He is the true God and eternal life", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:20">1 John  5:20</a>.<a name=573:3></a> It is in the working out of the truth of sonship that we arrive at liberty, because sonship is a matter that relates to the Person of Christ.<a name=573:4></a> It is a feature of the Person of Christ; and it ends up in this, in John's epistle, that "He is the true God and eternal life", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:20">1 John  5:20</a>.<a name=573:5></a> I was saying a moment ago that new birth lays the basis for eternal life, but now the basis of it is that Christ is eternal life, but He is the true God too.<a name=573:6></a> There is no time to enlarge on these things, but every one of us ought to make sure that he is progressing in these matters, progressing in the truth of Christ, who He is, and what He is, and arriving at what we have here in John's epistle, that "He is the true God and eternal life", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:20">1 John  5:20</a>.<a name=573:7></a> If we are to progress in the truth, let us be sure that we have these wonderful facts in our souls, as to who Jesus is.<a name=573:8></a> As become flesh He is the Son, and He is the true God; in His Person He <i>is</i> the true God; He has not become the true God, beloved.<a name=573:9></a> He has become Man, but He <i>is</i> the true God; He ever was the true God, personally, and so we are built up in the progressive line, as I said, of truth as to the Person of Christ.<a name=573:10></a>
