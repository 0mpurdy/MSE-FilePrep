		<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2">Genesis  2</a>suggests a moral system.<a name=1:5></a> The first chapter is the material, and Adam was to be the centre of the moral system, but he failed in it; so that this chapter supplies in type, Him of whom Adam was but a figure.<a name=1:6></a> What it suggests is the durableness of the order of humanity that was seen in Christ, not as yet the outward greatness of it; that is seen in the temple, but the durableness is seen in the ark.<a name=1:7></a> What is noticeable in the tabernacle is the smallness of things <i>outwardly</i>, and yet containing what is so infinitely precious; whereas, in the temple things are on a larger scale and the materials, especially the woods used, are different.<a name=1:8></a> The wood in the temple is largely cedar, though there are other species of wood, because it is a question of Christ glorified and the Spirit.<a name=1:9></a> It is the cedar and the olive.<a name=1:10></a> The cedar suggests the greatness and stateliness of things, but the tabernacle links with the Lord's position here.<a name=1:11></a> There was lowliness and outward insignificance, but containing the most precious things.<a name=1:12></a> Consideration of the ark enables us to arrive at what will endure to the end.<a name=1:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=2:9></a> Young believers especially are apt to be discouraged because of the smallness of things connected with the testimony of God, whereas they are very great really.<a name=2:10></a> The temple-system is the <i>great</i> side, it refers to the time of manifestation.<a name=2:11></a> So you have different kinds of wood from that spoken of in the tabernacle; there is olive, which alludes to the Spirit, and cedar, which alludes to the greatness of Christ.<a name=2:12></a> The thought of God is that we should be in the light of the greatness of the system when it is manifested.<a name=2:13></a> It sustains us in the period of its outward smallness and insignificance.<a name=2:14></a>

A covenant is an agreement between two parties; that made with Israel we find in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#19">Exodus  19</a>and 20.<a name=5:1></a> The covenant becomes a testimony on the part of God; that is to say, the tables represent that His will must prevail in the universe.<a name=5:2></a> Therefore, they became a testimony to Him (compare <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#19">Psalm  19</a>) and were treasured up in the ark.<a name=5:3></a> At the same time there was also a covenant, so that you have both expressions, "the ark of the covenant" and the "ark of the testimony".<a name=5:4></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=17:1></a> It would be noticed that the things spoken of in chapter 25 are again alluded to in the end of this chapter 26.<a name=17:2></a> They are alluded to merely to show that they are now in their place, and under protection.<a name=17:3></a> So that chapter 25 really presents the positive things that are before God, by which He carries out His purpose.<a name=17:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.S.<a name=17:5></a>S.<a name=17:6></a> That is the ark, the mercy-seat, the table of shewbread and the candlestick.<a name=17:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=17:8></a> Yes.<a name=17:9></a> These are the positive things, so that chapter 25 contains the great central subject of all that follows.<a name=17:10></a> Chapter 26 sets out the means by which they are protected, and also, we may add, concealed for the moment.<a name=17:11></a> So that what we come to practically here is fellowship, because the principles of fellowship really took the place of that element of protection for divine things which was seen in Christ personally.<a name=17:12></a> Whilst He was here, He kept everything for God.<a name=17:13></a> Fellowship carried on that thought, so that as applied to us this chapter involves fellowship; fellowship viewed as that in which divine things are preserved.<a name=17:14></a> There are different coverings, and they all refer, in one sense, to what obtained among the Lord's people at the beginning.<a name=17:15></a> They were all, in principle in Christ, but the type applies more to Christianity.<a name=17:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=17:20></a> Yes.<a name=17:21></a> The first thing that we meet with is the curtains.<a name=17:22></a> The inner curtains are of different dimensions from the curtains of goats' hair.<a name=17:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		J.T.<a name=17:29></a> It shows there are inner and outer circles,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.L.<a name=18:2></a>J.<a name=18:3></a> So in the first you get, "it shall be one", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#26:6">Exodus  26:6</a> but in the last, "that it may be one".<a name=18:4></a> <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#26:11">Exodus  26:11</a>.<a name=18:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=18:6></a> Therefore the first curtains refer to the new man.<a name=18:7></a> The divine nature is seen within.<a name=18:8></a> They are seen within the tabernacle, whereas the goats' hair, and the rams' skins, and the badgers' skins, were seen without, not within.<a name=18:9></a> That which was first seen in Christ was to be continued in the saints; in other words, what was true in Him became true in us.<a name=18:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.L.<a name=18:11></a>J.<a name=18:12></a> Would you say the curtains have their answer in the Lord's prayer in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:22">John  17:22</a>, "that they may be one"?<a name=18:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=18:14></a> Yes.<a name=18:15></a> I think oneness is in the Spirit, but there is the exercise that it should be so, which I think the goats' hair and the other curtains suggest, whilst from the divine side we are one.<a name=18:16></a> It is laid down in <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3:28">Galatians  3:28</a> that "ye are all one in Christ Jesus".<a name=18:17></a> That is from the divine point of view, but then we must see to it that it is so practically.<a name=18:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.B-s.<a name=18:19></a> There is a difference between the first curtains and the veil.<a name=18:20></a> In the first curtains the fine twined linen is mentioned first and in the veil, the blue comes first.<a name=18:21></a> What is the reason?<a name=18:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=18:23></a> In the veil, I should say, the first thought is that Christ is heavenly.<a name=18:24></a> That comes out afterwards in us.<a name=18:25></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.F.<a name=18:26></a>M.<a name=18:27></a> Is there this difference between the veil and the curtains; that you have what answers to the veil in John's gospel, and what answers to the curtains in John's epistle?<a name=18:28></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=18:29></a> That is good.<a name=18:30></a> The epistle shows how that which is from the beginning is continued.<a name=18:31></a> It is not <i>He</i> but <i>that</i>.<a name=18:32></a> It is the kind of thing.<a name=18:33></a> Now that is the first chapter of John's epistle.<a name=18:34></a> In the second

		E.J.<a name=84:3></a>McB.<a name=84:4></a> In proposing this scripture, you had the inheritance mainly before you?<a name=84:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=84:6></a> Yes.<a name=84:7></a> Taking possession of the inheritance requires in us a state formed by the Spirit.<a name=84:8></a> This book furnishes us with examples of the state that appreciates the inheritance; so that, in that way, it corresponds with the epistle to the Ephesians.<a name=84:9></a> I think that the Lord would emphasise in these days the importance of our continuance; of our going on to the end.<a name=84:10></a> The teaching of the Pentateuch is completed in the book of Joshua; that is to say, this book presents the end of a course of dealings on the part of God with His people.<a name=84:11></a> The book of Judges opens up another chapter in the history of the people.<a name=84:12></a> I think that the Lord would emphasise the importance of our going on to the end <i>subjectively</i>.<a name=84:13></a> Of course His <i>coming</i> is the end; that is <i>His</i> side; <i>our</i> side is that we should <i>continue</i> to the end.<a name=84:14></a> In connection with that I wish to point out the difference between the inheritance as given by Moses, and the inheritance given by Eleazar and Joshua, for one observes that many in this day are content with what <i>Moses</i> gives.<a name=84:15></a>

		extent of the inheritance that Moses allotted, but there was an inheritance which Eleazar and Joshua gave which went far beyond that.<a name=85:1></a> It helps us in the understanding of the book of Joshua to consider the man himself.<a name=85:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.J.<a name=85:3></a>McB.<a name=85:4></a> I think your opening remarks about the question of spiritual state bring in the importance of the first appearance of Joshua on the scene -- where he comes in to oppose Amalek.<a name=85:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=85:6></a> Yes, he appears first in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#17">Exodus  17</a>; and he appears where the waters flowed at Rephidim.<a name=85:7></a> Now I think you have there the suggestion of the Spirit.<a name=85:8></a> The rock was stricken, the waters flowed, and there Amalek appeared; he appeared at Rephidim.<a name=85:9></a> When the Spirit begins to appear in the history of the saints, Satan works through the flesh in order to prevent spiritual formation.<a name=85:10></a> That is what Satan is set against -- formation; so here we find in type the flesh and the Spirit: Amalek is there and Joshua is there.<a name=85:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.N.<a name=85:12></a>H.<a name=85:13></a> Do you think that Joshua illustrates Christ acting in the power of the Spirit; whereas Eleazar is more Christ as Priest who is absent, and therefore he does not come so much into prominence, but he is behind the scenes?<a name=85:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=85:15></a> Yes; I think that is quite right.<a name=85:16></a> Eleazar is mentioned first in the allotting of the inheritance.<a name=85:17></a> I think it would greatly help to the understanding of the subject to see how Joshua appears.<a name=85:18></a> He appears first to contend with Amalek; that is to say, when the soul is relieved Satan would prevent formation; he would hinder the work of the Spirit.<a name=85:19></a> So Amalek appears just there, and Joshua takes up the conflict when Amalek appears.<a name=85:20></a> It is not Moses, it is Joshua; and that conflict goes on "from generation to generation", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#17:16">Exodus  17:16</a> because it is as if God would give room for the work of the Spirit in the soul.<a name=85:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=86:8></a> Moses is ever the authority of the Lord; and you will find there is no direct communication to Joshua from the Lord until Moses dies.<a name=86:9></a> As you see in this chapter, after the death of Moses the Lord speaks to Joshua; but prior to that the communications to Joshua are through Moses.<a name=86:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		E.N.<a name=86:11></a>H.<a name=86:12></a> Would you say the authority of Moses is illustrated by his rod?<a name=86:13></a> His rod can take them through the wilderness, but it could not take them into the land.<a name=86:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=86:15></a> But whilst Moses lived he was the mediator.<a name=86:16></a> All communications from the Lord for Joshua came through Moses, so what Joshua represents is subordinate to the authority of Christ.<a name=86:17></a> Now the authority of Christ is what is always necessary; it is specially evident when your will is active.<a name=86:18></a> Joshua had no rod; he had no symbol of authority.<a name=86:19></a>

		J.T.<a name=87:12></a> Well, Moses comes right up to the banks of the Jordan, and until he dies Joshua was not formally and directly recognised by the Lord; so we must leave every room for the authority of Moses.<a name=87:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		J.T.<a name=98:1></a> What occupied us mainly was the place which Joshua holds as a type.<a name=98:2></a> He appears first in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#17">Exodus  17</a>, where at Rephidim the water flowed from the smitten rock: and as they drank they were attacked by Amalek.<a name=98:3></a> Amalek signifies in type Satan acting through the flesh to set aside the operations of the Spirit in the believer.<a name=98:4></a> So Joshua appears there, to undertake the conflict against Amalek.<a name=98:5></a> And then it was pointed out that he is viewed as Moses' attendant, or minister; he accompanied Moses up to the mount when he received the instructions in regard to the tabernacle.<a name=98:6></a> On returning with Moses, after Moses had pitched the tabernacle outside the camp, we are told that "Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#33:11">Exodus  33:11</a>.<a name=98:7></a> It was pointed out further that Joshua therefore typically represents Christ as supporting us objectively in connection with the work of the Spirit subjectively, so as to introduce us into the inheritance.<a name=98:8></a> Then finally we saw that the answer to Joshua as a type is seen in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>and in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:27">Colossians  1:27</a> -- "Christ in you".<a name=98:9></a>

		APPRECIATION OF THE INHERITANCE (3)
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.M.<a name=109:1></a> For the benefit of those who were not present this morning, will you kindly outline what we had before us, and link it up with this chapter.<a name=109:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=109:3></a> We read chapter 14 with the object of considering the inheritance, and distinguishing between the inheritance given by Moses and that given by Eleazar and Joshua.<a name=109:4></a> It was pointed out that the two-and-a-half tribes were content with what Moses gave (the epistle to the Romans answers to this), whereas the other tribes, whilst they also had what the two-and-a-half had, had a good deal more.<a name=109:5></a> It was pointed out that chapter 10 suggests to us in antitype the man in Christ; that is, Joshua being honoured by heaven.<a name=109:6></a> It is stated that there never was a day before nor after, that the Lord hearkened to the voice of a man.<a name=109:7></a> This shows in type how a man in Christ is honoured, or, as we may say, how Christ Himself is honoured, by heaven.<a name=109:8></a> We saw how Caleb illustrates the man in Christ as having an appreciation of the heavenly portion, and having the energy of soul to lay hold of it and to possess it.<a name=109:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.K.<a name=109:10></a> Just say a word or two more as to the difference between what Moses gave and what Eleazar and Joshua gave.<a name=109:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=109:12></a> What Moses gave in the antitype does not go beyond the gift of the Spirit; so, as I said, the epistle to the Romans answers to it; whereas what Eleazar and Joshua gave not only implies the gift of the Spirit, but the place in which we have the blessing; and the epistle to the Ephesians opens up the place where we are blessed with all spiritual blessings -- in the <i>heavenly places</i> in Christ; that is to say, the emphasis is on the <i>place</i> where we have the blessings.<a name=109:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		E.J.<a name=110:1></a>McB.<a name=110:2></a> In connecting the reading which we had yesterday afternoon with that of this morning we saw that the period in the book in which you get the history of the failure and breakdown -- what occurred both at Ai and in connection with the craft of the Gibeonites -- brought about a subduedness that enabled Joshua to go out as we see him in chapter 10.<a name=110:3></a> Caleb cherished in his heart the divine inheritance all the time he wandered with the people in the wilderness.<a name=110:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=110:5></a> It is very interesting to see in Revelation that the failure being fully owned, the Lord returns to expressions which imply the assembly's relationship with Him.<a name=110:6></a> The body of the book of Revelation is prophetic, and marked by distance, but when we come to the end (chapter 22) He announces Himself as "Jesus"; not now the Man clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle; not now with eyes as a flame of fire, and feet like fine brass; but the Man who is known in the Gospels: "<i>I</i> Jesus (He says) have sent mine angel to testify those things to you in the assemblies.<a name=110:7></a> <i>I</i> am the root and offspring of David, the bright and morning star", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:16">Revelation  22:16</a>.<a name=110:8></a> He returns in measure to the simplicity of things in regard to the assembly at the beginning.<a name=110:9></a> And what is so encouraging is that there is an answer to that on earth; "the Spirit and the bride say, Come".<a name=110:10></a> <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:17">Revelation  22:17</a>.<a name=110:11></a> It is really the appreciation of such a Man as Jesus and the appreciation of that Man -- of Jesus -- saves us from the appreciation of such a man as Antichrist, who is the very opposite.<a name=110:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.M.<a name=110:13></a> Would not that indicate that recovery is through the affections?<a name=110:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=110:15></a> Yes, quite so; <a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#10">Joshua  10</a>presents to us a <i>man</i> (Joshua), one who is dependent on God, who is the very opposite to Antichrist.<a name=110:16></a> I think it is very solemn that Antichrist springs out of church

		J.T.<a name=114:11></a> O, quite; it is a higher thought.<a name=114:12></a> The Levites had no inheritance among the people.<a name=114:13></a> Firstly, it is said in <a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#13:14">Joshua  13:14</a> "The sacrifices of the Lord God of Israel made by fire are their inheritance"; then secondly, verse 33, "the Lord God of Israel was their inheritance".<a name=114:14></a> The Lord Himself was their portion; and they had the priesthood.<a name=114:15></a> Finally we are brought back to the thought of God about them, that there were forty-eight cities (four times twelve), to be allotted to them; showing that the assembly at the present time is to be what it will be in the future when it comes out of heaven; that it is to be a predominating influence.<a name=114:16></a> So that we should be ever exercised as to what influence we exert over others.<a name=114:17></a>

		J.T.<a name=115:1></a> Yes, that is the order.<a name=115:2></a> I think it is helpful to point out that the tribe of Levi comes in for special recognition in connection with the failure of Israel at the time of the making of the golden calf.<a name=115:3></a> The Levites then took sides with Moses; they took sides with the Lord.<a name=115:4></a> Moses had said, "Who is on the Lord's side?<a name=115:5></a>" <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#32:26">Exodus  32:26</a> and the tribe of Levi responded to the call.<a name=115:6></a> And the Spirit's comment on that afterwards is that he did not recognise his father, his mother, or his brethren: "Who said to his father and to his mother, I see him not", <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#33:9">Deuteronomy  33:9</a>.<a name=115:7></a> That is one great feature of the Levites; they were concerned about the rights of God in the camp.<a name=115:8></a> The Levites judged the evil of the camp.<a name=115:9></a>

		My thought is to point out the importance of having an ideal.<a name=190:1></a> I need not say that God has His ideal.<a name=190:2></a> He had His ideal long before it took form.<a name=190:3></a> Christ was in the Father's heart as Man long before He became Man, but the time arrived in which the ideal was produced and, as produced, attention was called to Him.<a name=190:4></a> Once God's ideal appeared He became the divine standard; an ideal becomes one's glory; it <i>is</i> one's glory.<a name=190:5></a> The Lord Jesus as Man was God's ideal, and in that way He was God's glory; He was the glory of God.<a name=190:6></a> The Father's public recognition of the Lord was when He was seen in full manhood, when He had arrived at the age of thirty.<a name=190:7></a> I need not say that the divine claim to Him had been put forward earlier, for the statement of the angel Gabriel to Mary was, "That holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God".<a name=190:8></a> <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:35">Luke  1:35</a>.<a name=190:9></a> But the divine ideal is seen in a Man here.<a name=190:10></a> Scripture presents the Lord, as a Babe, and as a Boy, and as a Man.<a name=190:11></a> He was perfect in each stage of His growth, holy in His development, but it is when this development is complete that heaven gives public recognition to that blessed Man.<a name=190:12></a> He was praying and heaven was opened .<a name=190:13></a>.<a name=190:14></a>.<a name=190:15></a> .<a name=190:16></a> and a voice came out of heaven, <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#3:21">Luke  3:21</a>.<a name=190:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, what I wish to point out is, that God looks that for every one of us His ideal should be our ideal.<a name=191:13></a> Not one of us is of any account here in the way of testimony unless Christ is our ideal.<a name=191:14></a> There is no definiteness about you until you come to this; but then there is something further, and what I wish to make clear to you is, that the conception of the ideal is not enough, <i>you must bring it forth</i>.<a name=191:15></a> The expression used refers to what is maternal.<a name=191:16></a> We find in Scripture maternal ideas and paternal ideas.<a name=191:17></a> Now what God looks for is that we should, figuratively speaking, bring forth the ideal; it will not suffice, as to God's desire for us, to have it in a hidden way, though that is the beginning, but you must go on to "the joy that a man is born into the world", <a href="../bible/John.htm#16:21">John  16:21</a>.<a name=191:18></a> Christ must be everything to you, otherwise you are incomplete.<a name=191:19></a> What we find in regard to the church at Sardis in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3">Revelation  3</a>is, that there was nothing complete with them.<a name=191:20></a> The Lord says, "I have not

		The cry now in the world is for a <i>man</i>; the world is waiting for <i>its</i> man.<a name=192:7></a> The world's ideal is not infantile; it is a <i>man</i> that the world wants, and the man will appear.<a name=192:8></a> Conditions are ripe for the appearance of the man that the world seeks.<a name=192:9></a> The world awaits the appearance of its ideal, and he will be espoused by the world.<a name=192:10></a> This is very solemn to contemplate!<a name=192:11></a> The world's ideal is a very old ideal, and has been a long time in coming into evidence, but <i>come it will</i>.<a name=192:12></a> The apostle says that the day of Christ will not arrive until the falling away comes, and that MAN OF SIN is revealed.<a name=192:13></a> We often speak of him, and wonder at the significance of his number, but what I would press is, that our salvation from him is to have in our hearts the ideal that God has presented to us in Christ.<a name=192:14></a> It is either the one man or the other with us.<a name=192:15></a> The great antidote to the Antichrist is "the Christ".<a name=192:16></a> I am saying what is very elementary and simple, but what is of all importance to us at the present moment.<a name=192:17></a> If you have not Christ as your ideal, your ideal will ultimately be the Antichrist.<a name=192:18></a> But then, as I have said, you must not stop at the conception of the ideal, the gospel presents this, but to have the <i>conception and not to bring it forth is simply to be like Sardis</i>, incomplete, and God hates incompleteness.<a name=192:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=206:9></a> As subject to the Spirit we ought not to have any fear in approaching the great and holy subject of the humanity of Christ; as you read the gospels with a priestly eye you will see the glory; and the nearer you get to it, the more you are at home in it.<a name=206:10></a> We need not fear to draw near <i>as priests</i> to meditate upon Christ as Man.<a name=206:11></a> But if we touch it with our intellect, we come under judgment.<a name=206:12></a> So the first great point for the Levite is, to recognise, as a priest, that Jesus Christ is come in flesh.<a name=206:13></a> The ark is covered over with a veil; and we know the veil is His flesh.<a name=206:14></a> Do you not think so?<a name=206:15></a>

		J.T.<a name=254:3></a> A certain difficulty is felt generally in regard to this book for public readings; but I think we might get help as to the bearing of the book.<a name=254:4></a> No one who looks at it even casually can fail to see that it has a distinctive character; and above all books of the Old Testament it is important that we should read it with our thoughts on the <i>New</i> Testament.<a name=254:5></a> Perhaps certain damage accrues to us in reading the Old Testament as though it were not intended for New Testament people.<a name=254:6></a> If we have our thoughts in the New Testament when we read the Old Testament we shall understand the latter spiritually.<a name=254:7></a> What has specially struck me in this book is that it gives great prominence to what <i>Moses says</i>; not as elsewhere what he was <i>commanded</i> to say, but what <i>he</i> says.<a name=254:8></a> In the end of the book of Numbers it is what the Lord commanded him to say; or what the Lord commanded the people through Moses; whereas this book opens, as you will notice, with "These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel".<a name=254:9></a> <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#1:1">Deuteronomy  1:1</a>.<a name=254:10></a> So that Moses, personally, in his own intelligence, and his own affection for the people, is brought before us; all of which suggests to us Christ, but viewed as Head, rather than as Lord, although His authority is to be seen in the type.<a name=254:11></a> Unless we understand the books which emphasise the authority of Moses, we shall not understand this book; but if we do understand them, we shall see what this book sets forth, and that is, <i>the Headship of Christ</i>; and the sphere into which He as Head would introduce us.<a name=254:12></a>

		J.T.<a name=264:1></a> It may perhaps help to call attention again to the distinction that is to be made between the books of Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers, and this book of Deuteronomy, namely, that in Deuteronomy it is more what Moses' personal exercises were, and what he said to the people; whereas in the previous books it is what the <i>Lord</i> said to the people <i>through</i> Moses.<a name=264:2></a> That is, it is a question of God's authority in the previous three books, in the main; so you will find constantly in those three books "The Lord commanded Moses"; "The Lord spake unto Moses saying"; and so on.<a name=264:3></a> There was no room for Moses' exercises; it is a question of God's authority over our souls.<a name=264:4></a> That is largely what the kingdom implies.<a name=264:5></a>

		J.T.<a name=264:9></a> Yes; the authority of God exercised in Christ, leading to the subjection of our wills to God.<a name=264:10></a> When you come to Deuteronomy it is chiefly the exercises of Moses personally, and what he said to them.<a name=264:11></a> In the end of the book of Numbers it is said: "These are the commandments and the judgments which the Lord commanded, by the hand of Moses, unto the children of Israel, in the plains of Moab, by Jordan near Jericho" <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#36:13">Numbers  36:13</a>.<a name=264:12></a> In <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#1:1">Deuteronomy  1:1</a> it is: "These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan, in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red Sea"; and it goes on to say in this chapter that Moses began to "unfold this law" <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#1:5">Deuteronomy  1:5</a>.<a name=264:13></a> <i>Moses</i> began to unfold it.<a name=264:14></a> Consequently Deuteronomy answers more to the headship of Christ; and the book, in the body of it, is engaged with moralising on the previous history of the people.<a name=264:15></a> Moses reviewed their whole history; he shows what God had been to them, and what they had been.<a name=264:16></a>

		J.McF.<a name=276:1></a> Is this the expression you were referring to this morning, "Ye are the sons of the Lord your God"?<a name=276:2></a> <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#14:1">Deuteronomy  14:1</a>.<a name=276:3></a>

		J.T.<a name=276:4></a> Yes.<a name=276:5></a> I thought it would be helpful to see this side of the truth in this book.<a name=276:6></a> It is a book of encouragement, and one feature in it is, that it sets before us the greatness of our place and calling.<a name=276:7></a> We cannot go over each chapter, but you will notice in chapter 4 how God calls attention to what the nation was, as compared with other nations.<a name=276:8></a> In verse 7 we read; "what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them, as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon him for?<a name=276:9></a> And what nation is there so great that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day".<a name=276:10></a> <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#4:7">Deuteronomy  4:7</a>,8.<a name=276:11></a> Connecting that with chapter 14, "Ye are the sons of the Lord your God", we are reminded of what we are by calling.<a name=276:12></a> It is not what we should be here, but what we are; and certain results, or consequences, are expected.<a name=276:13></a> In connection with that it might be helpful to point out that we have to distinguish between covenant relationships, and family relationships.<a name=276:14></a> There are two lines running through Scripture; the one having to do with God entering into a covenant with man through the Mediator; and the other having to do with God adopting a family.<a name=276:15></a> Now this chapter, I think, touches the latter; we are the sons of God; so that our countenances are not to be disfigured.<a name=276:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=277:10></a> No doubt there is a similarity in all covenants.<a name=277:11></a> But the covenant with Israel, I think, supposes a certain kind of contract, or bond; it was a covenant contracted between two parties.<a name=277:12></a> The proposal that the bond should exist came from God; it originated with God.<a name=277:13></a> It comes in in our case in the Lord's supper, because the cup is the new covenant in His blood.<a name=277:14></a> It is a different thought from family relationships.<a name=277:15></a> The Supper, in that way, has more the covenant in view.<a name=277:16></a>

		J.T.<a name=281:5></a> Yes; and so the importance of the gospel of Luke in seeing how God has drawn near to man in the Mediator; it was an overture on God's part.<a name=281:6></a>

		J.B.<a name=281:7></a> "The grace of God that bringeth salvation to all men hath appeared, teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world", <a href="../bible/Titus.htm#2:11">Titus  2:11</a>, 12.<a name=281:8></a>

		J.T.<a name=312:1></a> This chapter clearly supposes that the people had fully arrived at the divine purpose for them; typically they are in their heavenly position; they are in the enjoyment, intelligently, of the land, and reaping the good, the fruit of it; and fully owning God as having brought them into it.<a name=312:2></a> So it answers, I think, in a peculiar way to the epistle to the Ephesians.<a name=312:3></a>
