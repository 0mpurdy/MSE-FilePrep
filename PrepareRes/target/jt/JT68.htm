		J.T.<a name=1:7></a> The thought in mind at this time is to look into the gospel of John, not as a whole, but the earlier chapters, beginning with chapter 1 and running on through chapter 7.<a name=1:8></a> In order to make as clear as possible what is in mind it may be said that the first chapter of John contemplates the <i>Person</i> of the Lord Jesus.<a name=1:9></a> It is in mind that we should compare this chapter with the first epistle of John; not that we should read the whole epistle, but have it in our minds, because the feeling is that the brethren all need to be grounded in the gospel of John just now.<a name=1:10></a> It is a time when we need to recognise the authority of the Scriptures, and John affords us instruction as to that.<a name=1:11></a> In chapter 1 of John's gospel we read, "In the beginning was the Word".<a name=1:12></a> Now while everybody is familiar with that statement, perhaps we shall see presently that we are not so familiar with its import as we had thought, and that we need to compare it with other scriptures that bear on the sonship of Christ, on His Person.<a name=1:13></a> John says, by the Spirit, in the first chapter, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God .<a name=1:14></a>.<a name=1:15></a>.<a name=1:16></a> .<a name=1:17></a> All things received being through him, and without him not one thing received being which has received being".<a name=1:18></a> And then it says, "In him was life", and that is the thought we have before us.<a name=1:19></a> Now comparing that with <a href="../bible/1John.htm#1:1">1 John  1:1</a> - 4, we read.<a name=1:20></a> "That which was from the beginning"; not <i>He</i> which was from the beginning, but, "That which was from the beginning".<a name=1:21></a>

		These verses in John's epistle are read so that the brethren may have the facts before them.<a name=2:1></a> The pronoun here is in the neuter; it is not the personal pronoun as in John's gospel, for it refers to a thing; that is, to the eternal life.<a name=2:2></a> Now the brethren will not misunderstand me, but while the Person is in mind, that is to say, "the eternal life" refers to Christ, yet eternal life is not a Person.<a name=2:3></a> Some years past, there were certain who regarded eternal life as a Person; they spoke of the personality of eternal life, which was not accurate.<a name=2:4></a> Although the Person is in mind, yet the idea in John's epistle is eternal life, whereas in chapter 1 of John's gospel it is the <i>Word</i>, the <i>Logos</i>, a divine Person.<a name=2:5></a> Although in manhood, nevertheless He is a divine eternal Person.<a name=2:6></a> The epistle says, "That which was from the beginning", meaning the beginning of Christ down here, whereas of "the beginning" in John l, we cannot say when it was; it says simply "the beginning".<a name=2:7></a> "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God".<a name=2:8></a> It is a Person that is in mind, an eternal Person, and He is going to be spoken of in the gospel of John.<a name=2:9></a> But there was more to be said, and the three epistles had to be written to make clear that it was the eternal life that was in mind, that the saints should understand that this was eternal life, and that this life was <i>in</i> Christ; "this life is in his Son".<a name=2:10></a> That Person could be seen and heard and handled here below.<a name=2:11></a> I suggest all that for the brethren to think over.<a name=2:12></a> It has been gone over many times, but I think we are still somewhat cloudy as to these great subjects, and the distinction between John's gospel and John's epistles.<a name=2:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:17></a> Just so, "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth", that is a question of God's operations, but in John it says, "In the beginning was the Word", without any question of operations.<a name=2:18></a>

		S.McC.<a name=3:1></a> Have you something specific in mind in saying that there is something about the beginning in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>that we may not be so clear about, although we have thought we were fairly clear about it?<a name=3:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:3></a> Well, just what we have remarked, that the first chapter of Genesis is a question of operations, the operations of God, "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth".<a name=3:4></a> In John's gospel it is not that, but "In the beginning was the Word".<a name=3:5></a> It is not what He is doing, but that <i>He is</i> there.<a name=3:6></a> And then He was with God, and He was God.<a name=3:7></a> After that we have the operations brought in, "all things were made by him".<a name=3:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=3:9></a> That would help us in that while through grace we have part <i>with Him</i> in many things there is a uniqueness about Christ, the Person of Christ, and about His sonship too, that we need to give greater attention to, do you think?<a name=3:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:11></a> I do, and therefore the order is as already remarked, "In the beginning was the Word", the <i>Logos</i>; that is to say, the Person through whom God's mind is known to us.<a name=3:12></a> Whatever God may have to say is made known through that Person, that is to say, the Logos.<a name=3:13></a> That is the first thing, and then the second is that "the Word was with God", the Logos was with God; then that He "was God", which brings out that the Lord Jesus is God Himself.<a name=3:14></a> There are not two Gods, or three Gods; there is only one God, and He is that God, and the Father is that God, and the Spirit is that God.<a name=3:15></a> There is one God but there are three Persons.<a name=3:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.H.<a name=3:17></a>P.<a name=3:18></a> I was wondering whether you had in mind that we should appreciate more the glorious Person of Christ as set forth in the first verse or two of the gospel as distinct from His operations, and our knowing Him through His operations?<a name=3:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:20></a> We should proceed on these lines, which is the reason for suggesting the first eighteen verses of

	<div class="paragraph">
		John's gospel.<a name=4:1></a> I would add another word to further clarify the position as to the Spirit and the place that we hope He shall have in our conversations.<a name=4:2></a> In chapter 7 it is said, "For the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified".<a name=4:3></a> That is to say, what we have primarily in mind now is the question of eternal life which is basic, and it refers to what is down here because, as we see in chapter 6 the bread comes down from heaven; whereas chapter 7 speaks of Jesus being glorified, and what happens as a consequence after that.<a name=4:4></a> When Christ goes to heaven, that is to say when He is glorified, then the Spirit comes; and that is the point to make clear.<a name=4:5></a> It is an important matter in the minds of the brethren generally throughout the world at the present time, and I am not at all leaving that out, but my thought for the moment is that the brethren need the thought of the Lord's sonship, the Person of Christ Himself, and then to understand something of eternal life in that Person.<a name=4:6></a> The first epistle of John opens up thoughts as to <i>the</i> eternal life.<a name=4:7></a> When we come to chapter 7 we shall consider the Spirit specially, although we shall have occasion to speak of Him before, in many respects; but chapter 7 distinctly speaks of Him as here because Jesus is glorified.<a name=4:8></a> Moreover in chapter 6 the Lord speaks of "ascending up where he was before".<a name=4:9></a> "What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?<a name=4:10></a>" We shall have to connect that with the scripture in chapter 7 as to Christ glorified; the receiving of the Spirit stands in that relation; whereas the thought of eternal life stands in relation to the Holy Spirit down here, and to Christ down here as He was in incarnation, and for forty days after His resurrection which is alluded to in John's epistle.<a name=4:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.J.<a name=4:12></a>H.<a name=4:13></a> Is the thought that John's gospel shows that it necessitates a divine Person, such a One as we have referred to, that we might have eternal life,

		but when we come to the epistle there is something further, "that ye may know that ye have eternal life".<a name=5:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:2></a> That is the idea exactly.<a name=5:3></a> First that ye might have it; "God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believes on him may not perish, but have life eternal".<a name=5:4></a> That is the gospel, but the epistle was written, "that ye may know that ye have eternal life", which is a very important point.<a name=5:5></a> How many know that?<a name=5:6></a> How many know it consciously?<a name=5:7></a> We are told in the epistle, "He that believes on the Son of God has the witness in himself", which alludes to the Spirit, that it is not a question of testimony by the evangelist, or of the gospel, but that the Spirit of God Himself is in the christian.<a name=5:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		E.A.<a name=5:9></a>L.<a name=5:10></a> In <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24">Genesis  24</a>we read, "And she had said to the servant, Who is the man that is walking in the fields to meet us?<a name=5:11></a> And the servant said, That is my master!<a name=5:12></a>".<a name=5:13></a> The word <i>that</i> there, implies that she had the knowledge of Isaac through the operations of the servant, the Spirit typically.<a name=5:14></a> Would that help in bringing out what has just been said?<a name=5:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:16></a> That is, the Spirit is the witness.<a name=5:17></a>

		E.A.<a name=5:18></a>L.<a name=5:19></a> Yes, and He gives the bride the knowledge of the Lord Jesus, typified in Isaac.<a name=5:20></a> Thus He comes into this.<a name=5:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:22></a> Very good, and that brings up another question that is burning with us, that is, that we must recognise the authority of all Scripture.<a name=5:23></a> Every Scripture is inspired of God.<a name=5:24></a> There are those who have somewhat reduced the level of the Old Testament, but the Lord intends, I believe, at this present time to remind us that the Scripture cannot be broken, it is one whole.<a name=5:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.R.<a name=5:26></a> We get the same idea in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>, the Spirit witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God.<a name=5:27></a>

		A.N.<a name=6:1></a>W.<a name=6:2></a> The Lord touches that point in His statement in <a href="../bible/John.htm#7">John  7</a>, that "he that believes on me, as the scripture has said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water".<a name=6:3></a> He takes the pains to say, "as the scripture has said".<a name=6:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:5></a> That is good, I am glad you mentioned that, because it brings up the whole question as to the importance of the Old Testament scriptures in that the Lord Himself quotes them there, and yet you could hardly show exactly the part from which He quoted; we cannot say definitely, and yet we have His word, which is enough.<a name=6:6></a> What we are saying tests us as to our faith, because things are on the basis of faith and that is what John is aiming at, believing, and believing what the Lord Jesus has said.<a name=6:7></a> His words are authoritative, also the Scriptures.<a name=6:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.P.<a name=6:9></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>, speaking of eternal life, Jesus says to the Father, "That they should know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent".<a name=6:10></a> Does not eternal life involve the knowledge of divine Persons?<a name=6:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:12></a> You will remember that the same thought is found in the epistle of John where John says, "He is the true God and eternal life".<a name=6:13></a> That "He" is Christ.<a name=6:14></a> So that the Father is called the true God in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>, and the Son is called the true God in chapter 5 of John's epistle.<a name=6:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.B.<a name=6:16></a> "Ye search the scriptures, for ye think that in them ye have life eternal, and they it is which bear witness concerning me".<a name=6:17></a> That would relate to the Scriptures you speak of.<a name=6:18></a> The Lord gives full credit to those.<a name=6:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:20></a> That is of prime importance at the present time, because even though it may not be said or formally asserted, there are many who think that the Old Testament is on a lower level than the New, whereas it is not.<a name=6:21></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:5></a> Just so, and if you look at the beginning of Acts where the account is given of the introduction of christianity you will find a constant allusion to the Scriptures.<a name=7:6></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:11></a> Perhaps so.<a name=7:12></a> It is not a testament in the ordinary sense in which the word is used; it is a question of testimony; the word 'testament' is based on the idea of testimony.<a name=7:13></a> So that if we use the term, it means that we have a testimony in the Old Testament and that that testimony is to Christ; "and they are they which testify of me".<a name=7:14></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#5:39">John  5:39</a>.<a name=7:15></a> "And having begun from Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:27">Luke  24:27</a>.<a name=7:16></a>

		S.M.<a name=7:17></a> In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#17">Acts  17</a>we read, "And according to Paul's custom he went in among them, and on three sabbaths reasoned with them from the scriptures, opening and laying down that the Christ must have suffered".<a name=7:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:19></a> "Opening and laying down", just so; the opening up of things and then the laying them down with authority; that is the idea, the way we should read the Scriptures.<a name=7:20></a> A brother opens up something from his Bible, but then he is laying it down by the Spirit, and thus it is authoritative.<a name=7:21></a> I hope we have something of that here now.<a name=7:22></a>

		J.T.<a name=8:2></a> Yes.<a name=8:3></a> It does too, it does give liberty.<a name=8:4></a> It is wonderful really how liberty is coming in amongst the brethren on this very point, because the Lord is really resentful that we have been neglectful in this matter.<a name=8:5></a>

		V.C.<a name=8:6></a>L.<a name=8:7></a> Peter refers to the Spirit of Christ in the prophets.<a name=8:8></a> He refers to the prophets and what they testified, he speaks of the Spirit of Christ that was in them, testifying to the sufferings of Christ, and the glory after these.<a name=8:9></a> Would that not help our minds to see the true value of the prophetic word in the Old Testament?<a name=8:10></a>

		A.B.<a name=8:14></a> Would the apostle Peter in <a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#1:21">2 Peter  1:21</a> be referring to the whole scope of Scripture, when he says that "holy men of God spake under the power of the Holy Spirit"?<a name=8:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:16></a> Just so.<a name=8:17></a> There were no Scriptures when the book of Acts was written except the Old Testament.<a name=8:18></a> The Spirit of God began immediately to quote the Old Testament to confirm what had happened.<a name=8:19></a>

		J.T.<a name=66:9></a> I think the truth is advancing in this chapter; it is 'higher and higher yet', and when we come to the Father and the Son, and how the Father suggests the Son as food, I mean the life of Christ and the death of Christ, if the Father speaks about that we are on a higher level.<a name=66:10></a> They are acting together, and we are coming into what the action is; "he that eats my flesh and drinks my blood has life eternal".<a name=66:11></a> And then verse 57, "As the living Father has sent me and <i>I</i> live on account of the Father, <i>he</i> also who eats me shall live also on account of me".<a name=66:12></a> That is a higher thought, that is my position now, not simply that I am in fellowship, but I eat Christ; the Father gives me that food.<a name=66:13></a> The Lord says, "I live on account of the Father", and we live on account of Christ.<a name=66:14></a> That is the word, "on account of".<a name=66:15></a> The Lord says, "As the living Father has sent me and I live on account of the Father, <i>he</i> also who eats me shall live also on account of me".<a name=66:16></a> Notice "the living Father", it is a remarkable thought; not simply 'the Father', but "the living Father" and then "on account of".<a name=66:17></a> So that I am living on account of Christ or by virtue of the fact that He has supplied this food for me.<a name=66:18></a> It is the very highest level, you might say, as to eating.<a name=66:19></a>

		J.T.<a name=71:1></a> Our subject now is not to be based simply on the scriptures read; our subject is the Spirit of God Himself in view of what has come to the attention of the brethren for some months past, that there might be a clarification of it in our minds, and a readiness to give the Holy Spirit His place as a divine Person, as equal with the Father and with the Son.<a name=71:2></a> And so many scriptures will doubtless come before us in this inquiry.<a name=71:3></a> However, certain things that are outstanding ought to be remarked, and one is that the Old Testament has the same value as the New Testament.<a name=71:4></a> The value of the Old Testament is that it is Scripture, and the Scripture says itself, "Every scripture is divinely inspired, and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God may be complete, fully fitted to every good work", <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#3:16">2 Timothy  3:16</a>, 17.<a name=71:5></a> The Old Testament therefore should come into view a little, particularly the first chapter of the Bible, that is the first of Genesis, and then some passages in the book of Ezekiel where a great deal is said about the Spirit of God, and of speaking to Him, and of His speaking to others.<a name=71:6></a> In the New Testament, in the book of Acts, in the section referring to the introduction of the gentiles, we have the Spirit speaking to Peter, although it does not say definitely at first that the Spirit spoke to him, but clearly the voice is the Spirit's voice, the context shows it, that the Spirit is speaking to Peter, and Peter speaks to the Spirit.<a name=71:7></a> That is a point that we ought to be clear about.<a name=71:8></a> Moreover it is said in the book of Revelation, in chapter 14, that a voice is heard from heaven, "Blessed the dead who die in the Lord from henceforth".<a name=71:9></a> That voice clearly bears

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=85:20></a> It was just to bring out the place the Spirit has in the Lord's own remarks.<a name=85:21></a> As we know, the book of Revelation was given to Christ by God.<a name=85:22></a> It is a remarkable thing that God gave it to Him to show to His servants things which must shortly come to pass, and amongst these things that John was to write were "what thou hast seen", but particularly as to now, "the things that are".<a name=85:23></a> We have read from the things that are, meaning the addresses to certain assemblies, amongst which is the assembly of Philadelphia; and the most precious address of all

		is the one to that assembly, because in that connection the great revival has worked out.<a name=86:1></a> The Lord says to her, "<i>I</i> also will keep thee out of the hour of trial, which is about to come upon the whole habitable world, to try them that dwell upon the earth".<a name=86:2></a> The Lord says that to Philadelphia, and we are learning something of the meaning of Philadelphia, I mean to say, what the name means; brotherly love, and it is very precious that it does, and we should be in brotherly love.<a name=86:3></a> The Broadways makes way for it.<a name=86:4></a> But as we were saying, "the things that are" refer to the addresses to the assemblies, and that to Philadelphia is one of the most precious addresses that we have.<a name=86:5></a> The Lord says, to that assembly, which would mean the assembly in our day, "<i>I</i> also will keep thee out of the hour of trial, which is about to come upon the whole habitable world, to try them that dwell upon the earth".<a name=86:6></a> So that is a promise, and a most comforting promise, that whatever happens in regard to trade unionism or any other ism that is a trial to us, the Lord says, 'I will keep thee from it'.<a name=86:7></a> I would think that He means that we are to be kept out of it, not simply from it, but out of it, by being transferred to heaven, and it is a great comfort to have that in our minds.<a name=86:8></a> That is why I suggested that we should read these few verses.<a name=86:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.McK.<a name=86:10></a> Does that promise apply in principle at the present time?<a name=86:11></a> The Lord does not say that He will <i>take</i> them out of it, but if the saints are faithful in the things they have to go through such as you have mentioned, the Lord says He will <i>keep</i> them out of it.<a name=86:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=86:13></a> Yes, I think that is right too, I am glad you mentioned that; but I do believe, that the Lord really means that He will take us out of it by taking us up to heaven.<a name=86:14></a>

		J.T.<a name=87:1></a> You have experienced that, and you have been kept out of it, I think it ought to be understood that although the trade unions are now pretty stiff, and employment is not so full as it was, at the same time at bottom there is a secret understanding, especially in some parts, that if a man has a conscience, they will recognise it, I do not know whether you would confirm that?<a name=87:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=87:12></a> That would indicate that God is perhaps in the thing.<a name=87:13></a> We are not politicians of course at all, we are christians, and we are dealing with our own matters now; but at the same time the powers that be are our matters too, that we respect the powers that be.<a name=87:14></a> They are the law makers, there must be laws, and we are glad there are, and they make them, and we have access to these men.<a name=87:15></a> If we were simply to say, I know of a man who cannot get work because the trade union will not let him, the senators might be helped to suggest something that would lead to the brethren getting work without difficulty.<a name=87:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=88:9></a> Because it is a question of what the Lord Himself has been given, the revelation which God has given to Christ, "to shew to his bondmen what must shortly take place".<a name=88:10></a> He sent and signified it; the word 'signified' means that it is in signs, there are significations and signs; and He sent and signified it by His servant John to His servants.<a name=88:11></a> John is viewed as a bondman in this book, he takes a lowly place; he says, "I John, your brother and fellow-partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and patience, in Jesus".<a name=88:12></a> Then he tells us that he was in the Spirit on the Lord's day; much is made of the Spirit, and then he tells us that he heard a voice behind him, and it comes to light that the Lord is acting judicially in this first chapter.<a name=88:13></a> In the second chapter the Lord says, "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies".<a name=88:14></a> The Lord says, so to speak, 'I am saying so much, but

		W.McK.<a name=89:3></a> Does the fact that John denotes himself as a brother and fellow-partaker before he says, "I became in the Spirit", show what is possible for us?<a name=89:4></a>

		J.T.<a name=89:9></a> That is the idea.<a name=89:10></a> You might say, The Lord has said all that is to be said.<a name=89:11></a> He has written seven epistles to the assemblies.<a name=89:12></a> Why do they not contain all that is to be said?<a name=89:13></a> But then the Lord has not said everything; He is leaving something to the Spirit; so that we have ministry, we have meetings like this, and the Spirit speaks.<a name=89:14></a> It says, "let him hear what the Spirit says", not what the Lord says, but what the Spirit says to the assemblies.<a name=89:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=89:23></a> Quite so, and if we do not recognise that, we are not recognising the truth, because it is part of the truth, and it dates back to Nebuchadnezzar, when God handed over the government of the world to him; and this goes on still.<a name=89:24></a> Why should we not observe that, and recognise these facts?<a name=89:25></a> We are not politicians, we are simply acting wisely, we see our brethren suffering and we want to help them.<a name=89:26></a>

		Would the turtle dove typically suggest the Spirit, the form in which He would come down?<a name=90:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=90:2></a> Noah too had to do with that; the dove is mentioned in connection with him.<a name=90:3></a> It has to do with the blessed Lord Jesus, and when the Lord was about to be baptised the dove came down; the Spirit came in the form of a dove and abode upon Him, as if He enjoyed the thought of being with the Lord Himself.<a name=90:4></a> And we surely ought to enjoy the thought.<a name=90:5></a> Brothers have written to me from several different parts of the world that they are getting great enjoyment out of the thought of the communion of the Holy Spirit; that is one of the phrases that we get in the New Testament; the love of God, and the fellowship or communion of the Holy Spirit.<a name=90:6></a> Then too we read of the love of the Spirit, and these are great things that in our secret histories it is our privilege to enjoy.<a name=90:7></a> We are to be happy instead of being downcast, or overcome by circumstances; we are happy, for the Spirit is to shed abroad the love of God in our hearts, a very wide expression.<a name=90:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=90:11></a> Waters to swim in.<a name=90:12></a> There is no doubt that that might be a clue to what the Lord says in <a href="../bible/John.htm#7">John  7</a>as to the Spirit, "as the scripture has said, out of his belly shall flow rivers".<a name=90:13></a> That probably alludes to <a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#47">Ezekiel  47</a>.<a name=90:14></a> It is a wonderful chapter.<a name=90:15></a> We have not much more to say as to <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3">Revelation  3</a>, it is a matter of what the Spirit says to the assemblies, and how much there is for us in what He is saying.<a name=90:16></a> It is the Spirit in ministry.<a name=90:17></a>

		J.T.<a name=95:11></a> Well, I have been thinking lately that these relations into which God has entered through the incarnation have in mind what we are; it is God coming within the range of our intelligence and affections so as to secure us with a view to what He is in Himself.<a name=95:12></a> Having entered into the relation of Father with His Son, that relationship stands, but it is necessarily a narrower or more limited thought than the thought of Godhead, although the Father is God.<a name=95:13></a> The great thought is <i>God</i>; that is the word the Spirit of God uses to convey the Deity.<a name=95:14></a> That is the great thought.<a name=95:15></a> The relation into which He has entered is not anything less blessed, for it involves our being brought near in relations suited to Him, not simply as creatures but as sons; and all to the end that men might through redemption be brought near in freedom to worship God.<a name=95:16></a>

		J.T.<a name=158:1></a> It might be worthy of notice that the addresses to the assemblies may be taken to be historical as well as prophetical.<a name=158:2></a> That is to say, we can reckon historically from the letter to the assembly at Ephesus to the fifth one; we reckon the time that has elapsed.<a name=158:3></a> It is a question, however, of spiritual understanding, that the historical matter becomes clear after we come to Philadelphia, because the letter to that assembly is so definite that it is clear that the Lord meant, in that letter, to convey that He was thinking of the assembly as a whole.<a name=158:4></a> Laodicea, however, ends up the matter, and the Lord is seen there as spewing the whole public assembly out of His mouth.<a name=158:5></a> Hence it becomes very serious and solemn when we come to Laodicea.<a name=158:6></a> At the same time it is clearly helpful and instructive to keep the historical matter in mind.<a name=158:7></a> We can tell pretty well where we are, as we proceed from the first, and especially from Thyatira to the end; because Thyatira is collateral in time with the last three, so that we are now in the midst of it.<a name=158:8></a> Therefore we can discern that Sardis treats of the period of the Reformation.<a name=158:9></a> Thyatira, however, is earlier and runs collaterally with Sardis, the Romish system being now current and will be current to the end.<a name=158:10></a> We may thus reckon where we are at any given time, but especially now as we come to Pergamos, and then also when we come to Thyatira, because Jezebel points to a historical condition which is running its course.<a name=158:11></a> The later part of the book contemplates her in a political sense, where she is seen as the woman that rides the beast; but here in chapter 2 she is seen purely ecclesiastically.<a name=158:12></a> It is well to notice all this, as I believe it will clarify what we are now about to speak of.<a name=158:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=161:13></a> Very good.<a name=161:14></a> We have already had the idea of the word of God in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#4">Hebrews  4</a>, where it is said to be "sharper than any two-edged sword, and penetrating to the division of soul and spirit, both of joints and marrow, and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart".<a name=161:15></a>

		Ques.<a name=175:15></a> Referring to Thyatira; the word in verse 20 is, "Thou permittest the woman Jezebel", and then in verse 21, "And she will not repent"; not she <i>would</i> not but "she will not repent".<a name=175:16></a> Does that expose the boastful claim to authority of the Church of Rome?<a name=175:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=175:18></a> That would bring out just what has been remarked, that the political side of the position which begins in chapter 4 with the throne seen standing in heaven, has in mind that Jezebel comes into judgment, but not as Jezebel but as the woman that rides the beast.<a name=175:19></a> It is the same thing, the same system, only she is viewed politically, for she rides the beast, and so her doom is predicted; it is intimated, or seen; in chapter 18 of the book we are reading.<a name=175:20></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=204:5></a> Well, the early verses of chapter 21 contemplate almost what is figurative, because of the "as".<a name=204:6></a> John says, "I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea exists no more.<a name=204:7></a> And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God, prepared as a bride".<a name=204:8></a> The preparation and what works out in it: "as a bride", there, is a strong figurative presentation of the assembly.<a name=204:9></a> But when we come to verse 9 of chapter 21, it is said, "And there came one of the seven angels which had had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues, and spoke with me, saying, Come here, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife".<a name=204:10></a> So in this chapter we have come to the beginning of what we may call the eternal state, but still the administrative side that she is to occupy, and therefore the description that we have in the whole of chapter 21.<a name=204:11></a> In the meantime what is in mind is to get the idea of chapter 19 and how she is seen there.<a name=204:12></a> First we have the great jubilation over the overthrow of Babylon, and then in verses 6 and 7, "I heard as a voice of a great crowd, and as a voice of many waters, and as a voice of strong thunders, saying, Hallelujah, for the Lord our God the Almighty has taken to himself kingly power.<a name=204:13></a> Let us rejoice and exult, and give him glory; for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife has made herself ready".<a name=204:14></a> Then we are told what is given to her; so that we have presented to us in the passage almost the end of the responsible period and the beginning of the eternal conditions.<a name=204:15></a>

		J.T.<a name=285:7></a> Just so.<a name=285:8></a> In order to come to that, we might just proceed now from the passage that we read down to what is said in the beginning of verse 24, "And on the morrow they came to Caesarea.<a name=285:9></a> But Cornelius was looking for them, having called together his kinsmen and his intimate friends.<a name=285:10></a> And when Peter was now coming in, Cornelius met him".<a name=285:11></a> We have, in this section, the liberty that servants should have with the persons they serve.<a name=285:12></a> "When Peter was now coming in", it says, "Cornelius met him".<a name=285:13></a> There was a spirit of liberty between them, and it goes on to say, "and falling down did him homage".<a name=285:14></a> Well, he was mistaken there; he should not have done that, "But Peter made him rise, saying, Rise up: <i>I</i> myself also am a man".<a name=285:15></a> There was great humility there, taking his place just as a man, "And he went in, talking with him", another beautiful touch as to the liberty the servants should have with those they serve.<a name=285:16></a> He was "talking with him, and found many gathered together".<a name=285:17></a> Wonderful features!<a name=285:18></a> What a good opportunity for a meeting it was!<a name=285:19></a> "And he said to them, <i>Ye</i> know how it is unlawful for a Jew to be joined or come to one of a strange race, and to <i>me</i> God has shewn to call no man common or unclean.<a name=285:20></a> Wherefore also, having been sent for, I came without saying anything against it.<a name=285:21></a> I inquire therefore for what reason ye have sent for me".<a name=285:22></a> Now we can hear what Peter had to say, and I think we do well to look at what Peter said to this company of persons gathered in a house, perhaps

		J.T.<a name=286:4></a> Just so.<a name=286:5></a> Anyway, it fits in nicely, for he was ready to come, and therefore he says, "I inquire therefore for what reason ye have sent for me".<a name=286:6></a> Then Cornelius speaks; so we might as well listen to what Cornelius said, and then what Peter says in answer to it: "And Cornelius said, Four days ago I had been fasting unto this hour, and the ninth I was praying in my house, and lo, a man stood before me in bright clothing, and said, Cornelius, thy prayer has been heard, and thy alms have come in remembrance before God.<a name=286:7></a> Send therefore to Joppa and fetch Simon, who is surnamed Peter; he lodges in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea (who when he is come will speak to thee).<a name=286:8></a> Immediately therefore I sent to thee, and <i>thou</i> hast well done in coming.<a name=286:9></a> Now therefore <i>we</i> are all present before God to hear all things that are commanded thee of God".<a name=286:10></a> We have first of all what Cornelius said to Peter, and he refers to the man in bright clothing, which would be an angel, of course, and the whole passage is very beautiful as showing how things were, as the service of God went on in those days, "And Peter opening his mouth said .<a name=286:11></a>.<a name=286:12></a>.<a name=286:13></a>" Peter's mouth is referred to several times, which is another matter in those who serve, pointing to the kind of mouths we may have.<a name=286:14></a> And so "Peter opening his mouth said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons, but in every nation he that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him.<a name=286:15></a> The word which he sent to the sons of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ, (<i>he</i> is Lord of all things), <i>ye</i> know; the testimony which has spread through the whole of Judaea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we are to notice all these items; first of all, Paul cried with a loud voice, he was sincere in the thing.<a name=338:2></a> The earthquake did its own work, it was a sign.<a name=338:3></a> That is what that was; it was a sign of power; but the words of Paul were, "Do thyself no harm".<a name=338:4></a> That was grace.<a name=338:5></a> It was pure grace and showed that he was sympathetic with the man, "Do thyself no harm, for we are all here".<a name=338:6></a> They had not fled; they did not want to rush away, to get out of his way; they just were there.<a name=338:7></a> They were conscious that they were in the Lord's service, and would behave properly in it.<a name=338:8></a> Then he asked for lights.<a name=338:9></a> Now notice, he does not ask for <i>a</i> light.<a name=338:10></a> That has often been pointed out, but there are lights, more than one light.<a name=338:11></a> There might thus be an opportunity for more than one brother to enlighten him, and there were two.<a name=338:12></a> Then the next thing is, he leads them out and said, "Sirs".<a name=338:13></a> Notice, he is respectful to them, although they were his prisoners, "What must I do that I may be saved?<a name=338:14></a>" And then they said to him, "Believe on the Lord Jesus and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house".<a name=338:15></a> The pronoun <i>thou</i> shows how intent they were to get at his soul, to get at the man himself.<a name=338:16></a> It is "thou and thy house".<a name=338:17></a> So that in result the man is thoroughly in line with those that are seeking to serve the Lord in the matter.<a name=338:18></a> He is thoroughly in line, and, of course, he would be, for it would be in Paul and Silas' mind that he might become part of the assembly; he is assembly material.<a name=338:19></a>

		J.T.<a name=342:1></a> I was thinking of the Lord's supper and the relation in which it stands to the Holy Spirit.<a name=342:2></a> It will be observed that the introduction of the Lord's supper here is accompanied by the question of headship in the early part of the chapter, and then the question of the Spirit in chapter 12.<a name=342:3></a> These two thoughts should therefore occupy us a little, especially the twelfth chapter; that is to say, the relation of the Spirit in the celebration of the Lord's supper and what part He has in it.<a name=342:4></a> In the first place, however, as we have remarked, the idea of headship is seen in chapter 11, beginning with the word, "I wish you to know that the Christ is the head of every man, but woman's head is the man, and the Christ's head God".<a name=342:5></a> The question of the covering of the head is thus treated in the early part of chapter 11 prior to the introduction of the Lord's supper.<a name=342:6></a> It is as if the dress of sisters (brothers and sisters, but especially sisters) is in mind, and that there should be seemliness in such.<a name=342:7></a> There should be deference to the man, and the man to Christ, and Christ to God; so it is the order of these things that is seen in the first part of the chapter, then the Lord's supper following, and then the Spirit in chapter 12.<a name=342:8></a> It is thought that we may perhaps look at this part of the subject now, and, in the evening, some sections from the second epistle.<a name=342:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=343:6></a> Verse 5 is, "Every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered puts her own head to shame; for it is one and the same as a shaved woman"; and verse 10 says, "Therefore ought the woman to have authority"; that is, the word is "authority", "on her head, on account of the angels".<a name=343:7></a> It shows that the presence of angels is in mind in view of all this because they are ministering servants sent out for ministry on account of us, as heirs of salvation, and clearly they have a part in the service that we have now in mind.<a name=343:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=343:12></a> In verse 10 what is alluded to is authority, power in the sense of authority.<a name=343:13></a> That is to say there is the recognition that there is one above the woman, there is a power or authority above her; whereas in praying and prophesying it is to show respect for order.<a name=343:14></a> It is a question of what is seemly in woman's clothing, and especially her head covering.<a name=343:15></a> The same idea is attached to the man as to his head being uncovered, but the stress, undoubtedly, is on the sisters, or women rather.<a name=343:16></a> The man and woman are the principal theme really in the mind of the Spirit in this part of the chapter.<a name=343:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=364:1></a> This second epistle to the Corinthians affords much encouragement as to discipline, for the results of the discipline recorded in the first epistle are evidently quick.<a name=364:2></a> They are, in fact, quicker than the apostle himself had indicated.<a name=364:3></a> So that there seems to be an opportunity for us to take account of discipline, wherever it is needed, and not to fear to execute it, if necessary, and there will be results accordingly, as we see in the second chapter of this epistle.<a name=364:4></a> The apostle says in verse 3 of chapter 2, "I have written this very letter to you, that coming I may not have grief from those from whom I ought to have joy; trusting in you all that my joy is that of you all.<a name=364:5></a> For out of much tribulation and distress of heart I wrote to you, with many tears; not that ye may be grieved, but that ye may know the love which I have very abundantly towards you.<a name=364:6></a> But if any one has grieved, he has grieved, not me, but in part (that I may not overcharge you) all of you.<a name=364:7></a> Sufficient to such a one is this rebuke which has been inflicted by the many; so that on the contrary ye should rather shew grace and encourage, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with excessive grief.<a name=364:8></a> Wherefore I exhort you to assure him of your love.<a name=364:9></a> For to this end also I have written, that I might know, by putting you to the test, if as to everything ye are obedient.<a name=364:10></a> But to whom ye forgive anything, <i>I</i> also; for <i>I</i> also, what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, it is for your sakes in the person of Christ; that we might not have Satan get an advantage against us, for we are not ignorant of <i>his</i> thoughts".<a name=364:11></a> Discipline comes in

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=365:5></a> Just so.<a name=365:6></a> The valley of Achor becomes a door of hope, so that we may peruse this third chapter with a view to coming to the glory of the Lord, and seeing how it comes into the meeting on the first day of the week; "looking on the glory of the Lord".<a name=365:7></a> What we shall see, I believe, is the interchange of thought as to the divine Persons and how They may be referred to interchangeably.<a name=365:8></a> Here the Spirit is called the Lord, and in James the Father is called Lord too, but the Lord Jesus is the only One said to be <i>made</i> Lord.<a name=365:9></a> So that when we refer to the Lord, we rightly refer to the Lord Jesus.<a name=365:10></a> But the Father is Lord too, and the Spirit is Lord, showing how the idea of authority enters into all these matters, especially discipline.<a name=365:11></a>

		J.T.<a name=365:15></a> Well, just that the title attaches to Him.<a name=365:16></a> In verse 16 we have, "But when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil is taken away.<a name=365:17></a> Now the Lord is the Spirit", and then again, "but where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty".<a name=365:18></a> So that there is clearly an interchange of thought as to the word <i>Lord</i>, and it refers to the Spirit here.<a name=365:19></a> We have to take account of that, and it will prove a greater advantage than we have understood, if we discern that something is directly of the Spirit and that the Spirit will deal with it.<a name=365:20></a> In the beginning of the chapter it is a question of letters of commendation, and the apostle alludes to it as if the Corinthians might have suggested that he needed one; but they were his letter,

		J.T.<a name=411:1></a> The gospel of John has been much before the brethren of late, and it has occurred to me that we should look at the first epistle of John at this time, with a view to apprehending the distinction that is to be made between the gospel of John and the three epistles.<a name=411:2></a> In the gospel of John the Spirit of God begins with the Person of Christ, as it is said, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God".<a name=411:3></a> Whereas, in John's epistle, it is "That which was from the beginning".<a name=411:4></a> It is not 'He who', but "That which"; that is to say, it is a thing or system which the Lord has established, and set up here on earth at the present time with a view to testimony, with a view to the saints walking in the light as God is in the light.<a name=411:5></a> "That which was from the beginning" refers to the beginning of Christ's service and ministry here, and then it states "that which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes; that which we contemplated, and our hands handled, concerning the word of life"; and then, "(and the life has been manifested, and we have seen, and bear witness, and report to you the eternal life, which was with the Father, and has been manifested to us): that which we have seen and heard we report to you, that ye also may have fellowship with us; and our fellowship is indeed with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.<a name=411:6></a> And these things write we to you that your joy may be full".<a name=411:7></a> So that the Spirit of God is here bringing before us what the Lord Jesus set up as having died and risen and having been glorified, and having sent down the Spirit.<a name=411:8></a> That is to say, it is a system of things unto which we are brought as believers,

		J.T.<a name=412:5></a> That is the idea; carried through, and it is carried through now.<a name=412:6></a> It has been carried through from the outset, from Pentecost, and still holds, the Spirit of God being here.<a name=412:7></a> He is here taking care of the divine interests, and of our interests too, and to bring us into the substance of eternal life and other such things.<a name=412:8></a> Although we are in the closing period of the dispensation, the Spirit of God is here.<a name=412:9></a> He has remained here since He came down at Pentecost, especially, in view of this epistle, to maintain the saints in the thought of life, as it is said, "the life has been manifested".<a name=412:10></a> "That which was from the beginning .<a name=412:11></a>.<a name=412:12></a>.<a name=412:13></a> which we have seen with our eyes; that which we contemplated, and our hands handled, concerning the word of life"; that is to say, the theme is "the word of life".<a name=412:14></a>

		J.T.<a name=458:1></a> As we continue to dwell on this epistle, we are struck with the place that knowledge has, and especially the knowledge that we have eternal life.<a name=458:2></a> The gospel is largely to show how it is to be obtained: "God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believes on him may .<a name=458:3></a>.<a name=458:4></a>.<a name=458:5></a> have life eternal", but the epistle is to show how we <i>know</i> that we have it.<a name=458:6></a> That is, we are to have the consciousness that we have it, and hence the chapter closes with the fact that not only is the Lord Jesus the true God but "he is the true God and eternal life".<a name=458:7></a> In the gospel it says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God".<a name=458:8></a> Here in the epistle the point is that He is the Son of God, but He is the true God, and not only that, but He is eternal life.<a name=458:9></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>, as we had it yesterday, the Father is the true God; but here the Son is the true God, and it might be equally said that the Spirit is the true God.<a name=458:10></a> There are not three Gods, but One.<a name=458:11></a> The Father is the true God, and the Son is God and the Spirit is God.<a name=458:12></a> Hence the frequency of the use of the word "God" in these two chapters, 4 and 5.<a name=458:13></a> If we look at it, we will be struck with the number of occurrences of the name "God".<a name=458:14></a> Here, in the first verse, "Every one that believes that Jesus is the Christ is begotten of God; and every one that loves him that has begotten loves also him that is begotten of him.<a name=458:15></a> Hereby know we that we love the children of God, when we love God and keep his commandments".<a name=458:16></a> That is the peculiarity of the epistle, how the divine Persons are spoken of, and how the believer is brought into the life which Christ is said to be, eternal life.<a name=458:17></a>

		C.A.<a name=513:25></a>I.<a name=513:26></a> You spoke earlier of our inseparableness from divine Persons and their love.<a name=513:27></a> Would this involve the true knowledge of God?<a name=513:28></a>

		J.T.<a name=514:7></a> That is what I would say is the unique chapter, for it treats of the love of God and the love of Christ.<a name=514:8></a> It is presented to us in one who appeals to the Ephesians that they might know his knowledge of the mystery.<a name=514:9></a> He says, "My intelligence in the mystery of the Christ".<a name=514:10></a> That implies that he had full knowledge of the mystery.<a name=514:11></a> He was a sufferer; he speaks of being a sufferer in those chapters.<a name=514:12></a>

		A.M.<a name=514:13></a> Is not the acceptance of suffering one of the primary elements of the kingdom?<a name=514:14></a> I was thinking of the teaching of the Lord in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#5">Matthew  5</a>.<a name=514:15></a> He says, "Blessed they who are persecuted on account of righteousness"; and then "Blessed are ye when they may reproach and persecute you".<a name=514:16></a> May we be liable to forget these principles in accepting the mercy and grace that is bestowed on us through the gospel?<a name=514:17></a>

		J.T.<a name=515:7></a> Just so, "Such as <i>I</i> also am".<a name=515:8></a> So that we have here sufferings in dealing with the antichrist, and sufferings which are involved in the idea of having faith, in John's epistle, and now here in the epistle to the Romans, the persuasion of Paul as to the love of God and the love of Christ, that nothing could separate us from them.<a name=515:9></a> It is a challenge to the whole universe, that nothing can separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.<a name=515:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=515:15></a> There is peculiar interest, it seems to me, attached to what we have said about Revelation, because we are face to face with this matter of the beast.<a name=515:16></a> Our young people do well to take notice of it, and as to the way out.<a name=515:17></a> The way out is by suffering, and the Lord's presence with us to comfort, and support us in it; and then that nothing can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.<a name=515:18></a> Divine love is active toward us, and nothing can separate us from it.<a name=515:19></a>
