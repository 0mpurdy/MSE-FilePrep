		THE SUPPER IN RELATION TO THE FIRST DAY OF THE WEEK

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:3></a> I thought it would be advisable to consider the first day of the week, and how the Supper stands in relation to it, and also to look at other features of the first day of the week, which we find elsewhere.<a name=1:4></a> In this passage we have the Supper in connection with the first day of the week; then in Revelation, John is in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and in the last chapter of 1 Corinthians you get the apostle's injunction to the Corinthians to set apart on the first day that which they wished to contribute.<a name=1:5></a> The three thoughts might be put together, the Supper, the Spirit, and the effect seen in giving.<a name=1:6></a> An important point to remember is that christianity is founded on precedent, rather than on injunction or commandment.<a name=1:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=1:8></a> The Supper comes from a precedent.<a name=1:9></a> The Lord instituted the Supper, therefore we have it.<a name=1:10></a> It is not a command.<a name=1:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:12></a> Well, we have the request, but He instituted the Supper, "This do", He says.<a name=1:13></a> The first day of the week is not given by commandment; it represents a spiritual idea and the early christians took notice of what Christ did on that day.<a name=1:14></a> They took notice of what He did when He instituted the Supper, and what He did on the first day of the week.<a name=1:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=1:16></a> What do you refer to?<a name=1:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:18></a> He came to His own on the first day of the week; they took notice of that.<a name=1:19></a> The Lord's day was never intended to be recognised by the world,

	<div class="paragraph">
		and we should never attempt to impose it on the world.<a name=2:1></a> It is a spiritual thought, whether it be the first day or the Lord's day.<a name=2:2></a> The first day sets forth a new beginning; the Lord's day the day in which His authority is recognised.<a name=2:3></a> Evidently it cannot be used by the world; the Lord's authority has no place there.<a name=2:4></a> He is rejected, but we anticipate the day when His authority will be universally recognised.<a name=2:5></a> John anticipated it as he was in the Spirit on the Lord's day.<a name=2:6></a> We begin with the Supper.<a name=2:7></a> The three scriptures may be taken, I think, in proper order as I have cited them, (1) The Supper; (2) "in the Spirit"; and (3) practical righteousness down here coming out in giving.<a name=2:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:9></a> Would there be any connection with what we do at the Supper, the bread, then the cup, then giving?<a name=2:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:11></a> The giving has reference to the scene down here; the Spirit has no reference to the external world; He has reference to the spiritual world.<a name=2:12></a> In giving you are not beside yourself, but in the Spirit you are.<a name=2:13></a> In giving you are considering the needs of saints, taking account of things in a sober way, but being in the Spirit puts you in accord with what is spiritual.<a name=2:14></a> They came together with the Supper in view, and it is mentioned as if it were customary on that day, but we are not told to do it then.<a name=2:15></a> The Lord came to the disciples on that day, therefore the precedent is established for us.<a name=2:16></a> Christianity is a free system, and is based on what others did; the Lord and the apostles.<a name=2:17></a> You will find that the Spirit of God in recording what is in the gospels aims at showing that the apostles' ministry and administration were in accord with what Christ did.<a name=2:18></a> Matthew shows that what Christ did supports what the apostles did in administration.<a name=2:19></a> Mark shows that the apostles' ministry was in accord with Christ's ministry.<a name=2:20></a> Luke shows that Paul's ministry was in

		accord with His ministry.<a name=3:1></a> Thus we have the apostles linked up with Christ in the testimony, so we may be perfectly sure of our ground, if following the principles established by them.<a name=3:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=3:3></a> The first day is more a day of privilege than of rest, I suppose?<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:5></a> Yes, it ought to be a day of rest, but the conditions that exist in the world forbid this; so the Lord, on the first day of the week, was marked by great activity, but His activity had one end in view, I think, to get the saints together.<a name=3:6></a> The saints were given to Him as a sort of recompense for Israel, and He wants them together, to be entirely for Himself.<a name=3:7></a> Each "week" is a figure of the whole christian period; every week stands by itself, and marks a course; so the assembly begins afresh every first day; the convening is renewed.<a name=3:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=3:9></a> Does not the apostle receive instruction as to the Supper in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11">1 Corinthians  11</a>, "For <i>I</i> received from the Lord"?<a name=3:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:11></a> That was to show it was for gentiles as well as Jews, as the record in the gospels does not extend beyond Jewish believers.<a name=3:12></a> The Lord shows the importance He attaches to the Supper by committing it to the apostle of the gentiles.<a name=3:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=3:14></a> What is the import of the Supper?<a name=3:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:16></a> It is the last meal of the day, ordinarily a meal in which we are free, using the figure of the ordinary meal.<a name=3:17></a> It comes in at the end of the day's labour, and not at the beginning.<a name=3:18></a> Your mind is not charged with the cares and responsibilities of the day.<a name=3:19></a> We should come together as free; the family idea is more seen at the Supper when all are free.<a name=3:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=3:21></a> How are you to secure that?<a name=3:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:23></a> There ought to be great exercise as to the Supper, I believe saints ought to be greatly exercised as to it, that we might have moral power to lay aside care, for the Lord is aiming at having the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=4:5></a> Do we specially come into touch with Christ then?<a name=4:6></a>

		J.T.<a name=4:7></a> He puts Himself into touch with us, I think.<a name=4:8></a>

		Ques.<a name=4:9></a> Why did you put the three points alluded to at the beginning in the order you did?<a name=4:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:11></a> The Supper is the proper starting point.<a name=4:12></a> From thence we are led on to the spiritual side, and the result of all is you come out here to exhibit the grace of Christ in giving, and the three things are connected with the first day of the week.<a name=4:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=4:14></a> Should we be exercised more about this?<a name=4:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:16></a> Apart from individual exercise, we are not equal to the Supper.<a name=4:17></a> We come together, I think, as we are here in flesh and blood as those who have to do with the world outside.<a name=4:18></a> Our exercises are very shallow with regard to divine things.<a name=4:19></a> What John says is "God is a spirit" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#4:24">John  4:24</a>), and hence having to do with God requires that we should be spiritual, for spiritual persons worship Him in spirit and in truth.<a name=4:20></a> Hence the necessity that flesh should not intrude.<a name=4:21></a> We come together, I think, as here in this world, and He reminds us that He knows each one of us by name as we are here; but as we lay hold of the spiritual world, of which He is Head.<a name=4:22></a> He gives us to understand that we have a new name, that all in His world is under His control, just as all in the natural creation was under Adam's control.<a name=4:23></a> As he gave names to all, so in Christ's world, He has all control.<a name=4:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=4:25></a> What is the reason for the order in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>, "The apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers"?<a name=4:26></a>

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:1></a> If not abiding in the apostles' doctrine, one would not be suitable for fellowship.<a name=5:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=5:3></a> It is necessary to have things rightly distinguished in our souls, in order that our exercises may take a proper channel.<a name=5:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:5></a> The Supper was never celebrated during the forty days in resurrection before the Lord ascended, but when He ascended, and the Spirit came, you find the Supper immediately.<a name=5:6></a> There is nothing about it during the forty days.<a name=5:7></a> This is significant.<a name=5:8></a> It was on the night in which He was betrayed that He instituted it, and the apostle who records it afterwards tells us the same thing.<a name=5:9></a> Hence, I take it, it has reference to the sphere in which He died, not the sphere of resurrection.<a name=5:10></a> Clearly He did not die in Canaan, as Canaan is the sphere of His resurrection.<a name=5:11></a> He died here in the world.<a name=5:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.G.<a name=5:13></a> What do you mean by the world?<a name=5:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:15></a> The world as it stood, where Christ was put to death; it was all arrayed against Christ.<a name=5:16></a> What was the disciples' path?<a name=5:17></a> Were they to go back to the world?<a name=5:18></a> Christ provided that they should have a fellowship; they were not to go out of the world, but to have a fellowship in it, the fellowship of His death; therefore in presence of the world, we are committed to His death.<a name=5:19></a>

		Ques.<a name=5:20></a> How do we partake of it?<a name=5:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:22></a> We are in flesh and blood when we partake of it; we are assumed to be so.<a name=5:23></a> John says, "I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day", and Paul says he was "caught up to the third heaven"; that is spiritual; that is the assembly.<a name=5:24></a> The breaking of bread introduces us to what is spiritual.<a name=5:25></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:4></a> In the chapter you have the two thoughts distinguished, breaking and eating.<a name=6:5></a> The breaking is the reminder of Christ, the eating could not be.<a name=6:6></a> He never ate the Supper, only the Passover.<a name=6:7></a> Hence you have in the Supper what is objective and what is subjective -- for the eye and for the mouth.<a name=6:8></a> You see and then you commit yourself to it.<a name=6:9></a> You get, "As often as ye shall eat".<a name=6:10></a>

		J.T.<a name=6:13></a> He primarily delivered it to us.<a name=6:14></a> As it is commonly used I do not go with it, as we do it when He is not here.<a name=6:15></a> Seeing He is not here, it has to be done by someone.<a name=6:16></a> I do not understand the Supper if Christ is present.<a name=6:17></a> If it were to be a supper over which He was to preside, I cannot see why He did not have it when He arose.<a name=6:18></a> As regards Emmaus it was an informal supper, and He just remained long enough to break the bread.<a name=6:19></a> If He were present at the Supper, we should not need to be reminded of Him, "This do in remembrance of me".<a name=6:20></a>

		RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF RELATIONS BETWEEN GOD AND MAN
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3:1">Romans  3:1</a> - 31
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=21:1></a> I suppose the epistle to the Romans is the testimony of the relations between God and man.<a name=21:2></a> I think it is a very great consideration that God was in a position to intervene and to re-establish the relationships between Himself and man, so that there is a complete adjustment of everything on the earth.<a name=21:3></a> The actual conditions that exist on earth are laid bare in the earlier part of the epistle, and then there is an adjustment of them in relation to God.<a name=21:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.L.<a name=21:5></a> And would you say that that adjustment, whilst in the first place it takes up the simple one of man as man in relation to God, also includes the special position of Israel?<a name=21:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=21:7></a> You must have the whole thing, but man as man is the great thesis.<a name=21:8></a> Unless God had justified Himself in reference to everything as well as man, things would not be quite clear.<a name=21:9></a> The Jew is alluded to in this chapter, "What advantage then hath the Jew?<a name=21:10></a> or what profit is there of circumcision?<a name=21:11></a> Much every way, chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God"; that is to say, all that was of God connected with Israel was fully accounted for and recognised; they had the oracles of God.<a name=21:12></a> I believe it is of great importance at the present time for the Lord's people to see that there must be a testimony in regard to our relationship with God, and to see how that adjustment has taken place, so that the position of man on earth and the relationship is fully established.<a name=21:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=21:18></a> Yes, the mercy-seat is the great central thought in the passage.<a name=21:19></a> It is as if God has taken
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=22>[Page 22]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		His seat on the throne, and put Himself in touch with His creatures in consistency with His nature.<a name=22:1></a> The adjustment is brought about from God's side.<a name=22:2></a> The central thought is how God justifies Himself.<a name=22:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.H.<a name=22:4></a>M.<a name=22:5></a> That He might be just and the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus.<a name=22:6></a>

		T.M.<a name=22:7></a>G.<a name=22:8></a> Just, according to His throne.<a name=22:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=22:10></a> The position suggests the tabernacle, not Egypt; it is the wilderness because the mercy-seat did not exist in Egypt.<a name=22:11></a> I think the thought is that God is acting from His own position.<a name=22:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.A.<a name=22:13></a>M.<a name=22:14></a> It is not a question of man's need, but of God's righteousness.<a name=22:15></a>

		J.T.<a name=22:16></a> Yes, exactly, how God puts Himself in touch with all that is without in accordance with His own nature.<a name=22:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		T.M.<a name=22:18></a>G.<a name=22:19></a> That is really the thought of the mercy-seat.<a name=22:20></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=22:25></a> I think so, and that every testimony previously rendered was ineffectual.<a name=22:26></a> The testimony of the creation had reference to man as a whole; the testimony of the law had reference to Israel, and so both were ineffective.<a name=22:27></a>

		J.T.<a name=22:30></a> And it is concerning His Son; that is to say, He has found a vessel to carry out His will.<a name=22:31></a> You see the testimonies previously rendered were not concerning His Son; they were divine; that is to say, creation was God's handiwork, and has to be taken account of; the testimony was there, but it was ineffective; but although ineffective, it rendered man unsuitable.<a name=22:32></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=23:1></a> That was clearly the thought in the testimony in creation; there was the index in it to what was spiritual; it only waited for the spiritual system to be introduced for us to understand the index; Christ answers in heaven now to all that was in the heavens.<a name=23:2></a> Then there was the testimony of God's will in Israel, that is, God asserted His right to man's affections, but He never secured them.<a name=23:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		T.M.<a name=23:4></a>G.<a name=23:5></a> That was the law really; He claimed what He had a right to.<a name=23:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.L.<a name=23:7></a> Would you not say Paul's object in writing is not exactly to present the gospel to sinners, but it is written to saints that they might understand the manner in which God has manifested His righteousness?<a name=23:8></a> If we are not clear on that, we do not apprehend our place.<a name=23:9></a> If we are not clear as to the position as men on earth, what is the use of bringing in the heavenly position?<a name=23:10></a> There is rather an interesting expression in the gospel which would connect itself with this, the publican condemned himself and justified God, and he got the blessing.<a name=23:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		T.M.<a name=23:12></a>G.<a name=23:13></a> That is what settles the soul.<a name=23:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=23:15></a> I think it prepares for the divine system, because as you find in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7">Luke  7</a>, you have the woman in the pharisee's house.<a name=23:16></a> What came out about her was that she loved much because she was forgiven much; therefore the better you understand Romans the better you love Christ.<a name=23:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=23:18></a> It is the over-abounding grace that comes out.<a name=23:19></a> The better you love Christ the better you are for Him; this applies not only to the disciples but to the women also, because they were with Him and ministered unto Him of their substance.<a name=23:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=23:21></a> The one who is forgiven much loves much; the more we judge sin the more we appreciate what Christ has done for us; so that to my mind the effect of the epistle to the Romans on the soul is wonderful.<a name=23:22></a> No one can tell you anything; you understand

		S.C.<a name=24:2></a> What you have just said shows the importance of a soul's having the sense of what is presented in the epistle to the Romans.<a name=24:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=24:4></a> You are not likely to be carried away by anything material if you are grounded in Romans.<a name=24:5></a> If you were the best astronomer in the world all you would know in regard to the heavens would be a testimony to God's wisdom.<a name=24:6></a> If we are clear as to the teaching of Romans, we are not likely to be carried away by an earthly religion, because that also is discovered.<a name=24:7></a> Everything here is exposed in its true light.<a name=24:8></a> You would not be carried away by anything material, because the material system is only a testimony to the spiritual; and you would not be carried away by man's wisdom, as the second chapter exposes it; and we shall not be carried away by an earthly religion.<a name=24:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		W.L.<a name=24:14></a> A thorough establishing in what is brought out in Romans prepares the soul for the introduction of heavenly truth; and until then, no matter how much we might speak about it, it has not come to be a reality in our souls, because you have not come to know God in heavenly relationship.<a name=24:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=24:16></a> The point is to distinguish God.<a name=24:17></a> However plausible men may be, if what they say is opposed to what God has said, you judge God must be true, even if you do not understand what they say.<a name=24:18></a> So

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=25:11></a> The point is to re-establish the relation between God and man, and what is to be gathered from it is that the relationship is in another Man.<a name=25:12></a> The first man is removed judicially in the cross, because the sin-offering was burnt without the camp.<a name=25:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=25:16></a> The sin-offering is burnt without the camp, showing the uncleanness of it; but then in the burnt-offering that man is gone in death; therefore you have a mercy-seat which is clearly seen in Christ risen.<a name=25:17></a> It is a question of what was brought inside, sprinkled on the mercy-seat and before it; it is the blood of the sin-offering.<a name=25:18></a>

		My thought is to seek to point out the advantages of walking in divinely prescribed conditions, and I shall take the liberty of referring to these conditions as embodying God's covenant.<a name=54:1></a> Whenever God is pleased to make a covenant, that covenant involves the conditions in which those are set with whom, or in regard of whom, the covenant at any given time is constituted.<a name=54:2></a> Moreover the privileges consequent upon the covenant depend upon the observation of the conditions on the part of those who are set in them.<a name=54:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, whilst God has not made a covenant directly with us, the assembly, nevertheless the conditions under which the assembly was inaugurated were involved in the new covenant; in other words, the assembly was established in the world under the conditions involved or set forth in the new covenant.<a name=54:4></a> The apostle Paul took the ground of being a minister of the new covenant.<a name=54:5></a> He said that God had made him, with others, a competent minister of the new covenant, "Not", he says, "of the letter, but of the spirit, for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#3:6">2 Corinthians  3:6</a>.<a name=54:6></a> "The Lord is that Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#3:17">2 Corinthians  3:17</a>.<a name=54:7></a> In other words, as I understand it, the apostle and his associates in their ministry established the conditions under which the assembly was inaugurated, as it has come to us in this world.<a name=54:8></a>

		I refer to that at the outset to get an understanding of the conditions in which the early christians were set.<a name=54:9></a> As I said, the apostle took the ground of being a minister and that was in the spirit of the covenant.<a name=54:10></a> Then he goes on to explain that the Lord is <i>that</i> Spirit, and in order to understand the expression,

	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish to come back to that, but, first of all, I go to the Old Testament in order to show that the advantages of the covenant, or the advantages of the conditions in which God was pleased to set up man at a given time, were only enjoyed as the conditions were complied with.<a name=55:10></a>

		Now, take Adam; you remember the remark of the prophet Hosea referring to Israel, "They like Adam have transgressed the covenant".<a name=55:11></a> From that we can gather that, in the mind of God, He established a covenant with Adam.<a name=55:12></a> He placed Adam here on earth under certain conditions.<a name=55:13></a> Adam was set up under certain conditions; they were briefly expressed.<a name=55:14></a> Adam was put under law, but the Spirit of God calls it the covenant, and we may dwell upon it with interest.<a name=55:15></a> There was a being deriving all that he was morally from God.<a name=55:16></a> All that he was morally he derived from God; and, as deriving <i>from</i> God, there

		You may perhaps have difficulty as to divine Persons moving towards you, but I just call attention to it as the scripture presents it.<a name=56:5></a> God <i>came</i> into the garden.<a name=56:6></a> He was not there always, but He came in, not in order to discover the sinner, Adam, for the scripture does not present that.<a name=56:7></a> "The Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day".<a name=56:8></a> He came into it at a moment which would be most advantageous to Adam, for I need not remind you that the elements had no effect upon God.<a name=56:9></a> If the cool of the day referred to anything, it referred to Adam.<a name=56:10></a> That happy relationship between God the Creator and the being whom He had created was in God's mind, so He came in and walked in the garden in the cool of the day and He called for Adam.<a name=56:11></a> There was the creature to whom God had imparted that which was intended to answer to Himself, and God looked for response.<a name=56:12></a> There would have been a full answer on God's part to man as under covenant conditions, and as abiding in the covenant Adam might count upon the divine presence, upon what I may speak of as divine visitation.<a name=56:13></a> One may easily infer that these would continue, as God would vouchsafe His presence to Adam in the garden.<a name=56:14></a> Instead of having response from His creature, He found Adam hiding.<a name=56:15></a>

		What I desire to show you, beloved friends, is the character of that which receives divine support and protection in this world.<a name=78:1></a> That there is such a thing as divine support and protection is, I suppose, admitted by all, even in the christian world around.<a name=78:2></a> Nations and men assume that God acts in protection and support; but I desire to show what it is that God is supporting.<a name=78:3></a> It is easy to show what He is not supporting; that would not be a very difficult task.<a name=78:4></a> There is one thing perfectly evident that He is not supporting -- the public body of christians: I think there is very good evidence that He is opposed to it.<a name=78:5></a> I think that God has given very distinct evidence of His disapproval of what is going on around us.<a name=78:6></a> God has His own way of indicating His pleasure and displeasure; and those who have eyes can see what God supports, and what He opposes, so that it would not be a difficult task to show that the public body called christians at the present time is not receiving any support from God.<a name=78:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I assume, as christians here each one would desire to be conscious of the support of God, and of the protection of God.<a name=78:8></a> I would call attention to the way God honoured and supported Christ; to show how God signalises Christ, and that in honouring, defending and supporting Him, God will not honour anything other than that which is of Christ.<a name=78:9></a>

		Now the Lord, beloved friends, was here in the world on the part of God.<a name=78:10></a> It is a very great thing to read the gospels in this light, that He came into this world on the part of God.<a name=78:11></a> He came knowing full well what was in it; He was well acquainted with the history of the world, and He came into it with the full knowledge of all, and in perfect sympathy with every thought that was in the heart of God.<a name=78:12></a>

		Well now, I wanted to show by connecting these two scriptures with what I read in the Old Testament how what I have remarked involves what, in official language, is called priesthood.<a name=92:2></a> We are called upon to consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession; <i>consider Him</i>.<a name=92:3></a> In the first scripture I read in Exodus, the Spirit of God gives us the genealogy of the tribes until we arrive at Levi, and then He stops; because for the moment He is not concerned about the tribes taking possession.<a name=92:4></a> He is concerned to bring before us the great vessels of the exodus.<a name=92:5></a> And what you will observe is that Moses' children are not mentioned -- he had sons -- whereas we have Aaron and his wife and his sons, and then Eleazar and his wife and his son Phinehas.<a name=92:6></a> After history will interpret the meaning of this.<a name=92:7></a> After history shows that whilst Moses' posterity, or one of them, is found in the way of idolatry, this son of Aaron, the son of Eleazar, is found standing before the ark of God.<a name=92:8></a> What I wish to point out is, dear brethren, that whilst apostleship has its own wonderful and unique place in the ways of God, it has to do with revelation, with inauguration, and is not charged with the maintenance of what is set up.<a name=92:9></a> If, therefore, we limit ourselves to apostleship, if we limit ourselves to light and ignore the Spirit, we shall find ourselves in the way of Jonathan.<a name=92:10></a> I wish the dear brethren would notice this particularly, because we have all round about us the results of adherence to the light by profession, and the total disregard of the Spirit, and all the blessed Spirit as here in this world involves, namely, the house of God.<a name=92:11></a> You will observe that Jonathan, the son of Gershom, served as priest in the tribe of Dan before an image made by an idolatrous man.<a name=92:12></a> He and his posterity carried

		What I wish to speak about tonight is the reinstatement of man in the presence of God.<a name=137:1></a> We have to take that in as a fact, that man is reinstated in the presence of God.<a name=137:2></a> This reinstatement was not hurried.<a name=137:3></a> It was after due consideration.<a name=137:4></a> I read <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#40">Genesis  40</a>to establish the principle.<a name=137:5></a> At that early date in the history of the race on the earth you have the principle of reinstatement established.<a name=137:6></a> And it is remarkable that it should appear in what may be regarded as the ministry of Joseph, a ministry which, in its earliest stages, took the form of interpretation.<a name=137:7></a> You will remember how Job alludes to the importance of an interpreter, one among a thousand.<a name=137:8></a> Joseph had a particular experience in dreams, but <i>his</i> dreams required no interpretation.<a name=137:9></a> The <i>utterance</i> of Joseph's dreams was their interpretation.<a name=137:10></a> His brothers understood him, his father understood him.<a name=137:11></a> His dreams, in the uttering of them, carried their own interpretation with them.<a name=137:12></a> I need not enlarge upon them; they are well known to you.<a name=137:13></a> I wish more particularly to refer to his interpretations, the first being found in this chapter and the next in the following one.<a name=137:14></a> I may say at the outset, that in the first interpretation, there is introduced the idea of reinstatement, and the reinstatement of man in the presence of God.<a name=137:15></a> And following upon that, in order, in the second interpretation in the next chapter, you have the preservation of the life of the world.<a name=137:16></a> These were two great principles to be introduced at that early date, that, whilst the race outwardly was marked by divine rejection, and consequently by death, there should appear in testimony the principle of reinstatement and the preservation of life.<a name=137:17></a>

		I should like to point out one or two principles which precede unity.<a name=172:5></a> You will remark that the speaking in Numbers is out of the tabernacle in the wilderness, that is how it reads.<a name=172:6></a> In Leviticus the speaking is simply out of the tabernacle; that is, the position of the tabernacle is not in view.<a name=172:7></a> It is a question of approach in Leviticus, and the ordinances there had reference to the land as well as to the wilderness, but when you come to Numbers, Jehovah speaks to Moses out of the tent in the wilderness, and the point is the relation of the people to it there.<a name=172:8></a> It is God taking account of His people in relation to the testimony in the wilderness.<a name=172:9></a> In the first chapter the numbering begins with Reuben, the eldest son of Jacob.<a name=172:10></a> God takes account of us according to our responsibility.<a name=172:11></a> That is a remarkable element.<a name=172:12></a> A christian who has not accepted his responsibility is in danger.<a name=172:13></a> Such a person as an irresponsible christian is not considered.<a name=172:14></a> All are responsible, and taken account of in regard to that responsibility.<a name=172:15></a> Do not ever say, <i>They</i> are the cause of it.<a name=172:16></a> Shoulder your responsibility.<a name=172:17></a> Whenever you speak of difficulties among God's people, the responsibility belongs to <i>you</i>.<a name=172:18></a> Think of David.<a name=172:19></a> "These sheep, what have they done?<a name=172:20></a>" I have done it all, he said, I am blameworthy.<a name=172:21></a> He accepted the principle of responsibility to God.<a name=172:22></a> It is a great day, young believer, when you accept your obligations in regard to God and to His testimony down here.<a name=172:23></a> Now, if you accept responsibility, the next thing is that God assigns your work.<a name=172:24></a> You cannot choose it.<a name=172:25></a> So in the next chapter Judah

		comes first.<a name=173:1></a> That tests you.<a name=173:2></a> If you are thinking only of your prominence in the work you are assigned to, you will be greatly tested if Judah is put before you.<a name=173:3></a> Judah stands for the sovereignty of God; so, when the tribes are placed in regard to the tabernacle, Judah comes first.<a name=173:4></a>

		These are two great principles therefore in Numbers.<a name=173:5></a> First there is responsibility for each one of us, secondly, the work you are to do is assigned to you by the Lord.<a name=173:6></a> Every true servant accepts these principles.<a name=173:7></a> If from his heart he seeks only the good of the testimony, he is not concerned what he does.<a name=173:8></a> The Lord knows better than you what you can do, and He assigns your work, "What shall I do, Lord?<a name=173:9></a>" There is a great deal to be done.<a name=173:10></a> I do not say Saul understood it, but his words summed up the situation.<a name=173:11></a> The apostles at Jerusalem had failed.<a name=173:12></a> I am not speaking disparagingly of them; they were most honoured men, but they had not carried out their commission.<a name=173:13></a> It extended to all nations.<a name=173:14></a> Jerusalem did not cover all nations, it was not even the capital of the world -- Rome was that -- and the apostles could not hope to come in touch with all nations at Jerusalem.<a name=173:15></a> Yet the testimony is that they remained there, "What shall I do, Lord?<a name=173:16></a>" What a work there was to do, the work of evangelising humanity!<a name=173:17></a> What a mighty work is there!<a name=173:18></a> But the <i>Lord</i> must decide the work to be done.<a name=173:19></a> Who did the work through Paul?<a name=173:20></a> It was the grace of Christ in him that accomplished the work.<a name=173:21></a> God did the work, and Paul got the credit -- and what a credit!<a name=173:22></a> What great results accrued from Paul's labours -- what Christ did through him -- not merely the evangelisation of the gentile, but the bringing home of a bride.<a name=173:23></a> What a mighty work that was!<a name=173:24></a> It all begins with the recognition in Saul's soul that the Lord must appoint his work.<a name=173:25></a>

		GIDEON THE BROTHER
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Judges.htm#8:1">Judges  8:1</a> - 3, 18 - 23
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=188:1></a> I thought it would be helpful to pursue the subject of Gideon.<a name=188:2></a> In this chapter we have indicated what he was as a brother.<a name=188:3></a> Chapter 6 is what he is -- among other things -- in his relations with God; chapter 7 is what marked him in the conflict; and chapter 8 indicates what he is as a <i>brother</i>, and how he manifests the traits becoming to a brother.<a name=188:4></a> If God is pleased to come in sovereignly and raise up a leader, those who have already been in the first place are sure to be affected, so now this chapter helps us in seeing in Gideon the spirit of a brother.<a name=188:5></a> He recognises the leading tribe -- Ephraim.<a name=188:6></a> He credits them with a great share in the victory, so that instead of a conflict arising between them he pacifies them; whereas Jephthah, later on, lacking the spirit of a brother, contends with Ephraim, and fearful slaughter ensues.<a name=188:7></a> But chapter 6, as we had yesterday, affords wonderful instruction as showing how the servant is set up in his relations with God.<a name=188:8></a> It is first power with God, then power with men.<a name=188:9></a> Another great truth that comes in incidentally is the principle of example.<a name=188:10></a> Christianity has been inaugurated on that principle; it is not by precept but by example.<a name=188:11></a> Now the old economy was on the ground of precept.<a name=188:12></a> Moses was not all that he said: Christ was all that He said, and hence is not only the law to us but the example.<a name=188:13></a> That is seen very clearly in Gideon.<a name=188:14></a> Chapter 7 brings in his followers; his companions in arms were wholly dependent for what they did on what he did.<a name=188:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=190:6></a> I thought too of how the latter part of <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20">Acts  20</a>would illustrate what you said as to the Lord looking on Gideon: "I have shewed you all things, that thus labouring .<a name=190:7></a>.<a name=190:8></a>.<a name=190:9></a> and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus .<a name=190:10></a>.<a name=190:11></a>.<a name=190:12></a>".<a name=190:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=190:14></a> That is excellent; that is just what I was thinking; Mark really got his ideas from Paul.<a name=190:15></a> He knew a good deal about the christian household, and he speaks more about the Lord being in a house than any of the other evangelists do.<a name=190:16></a> He was a companion of Paul at the beginning, and he had opportunity to see how the work was done.<a name=190:17></a> He failed in that; he went back to natural principles.<a name=190:18></a> Now, the greatest evidence that he was recovered lies in the fact that his gospel is taken up with the manner of the workmanship.<a name=190:19></a> He occupies you with the Lord's workmanship.<a name=190:20></a> So that the gospel looked at in that way is like chapter 7 of Judges -- it is the true Gideon.<a name=190:21></a> 'You look at me; do as I have done; what you see me do, you do'.<a name=190:22></a>

		J.T.<a name=190:25></a> Yes, God thinks a good deal of that.<a name=190:26></a> With Luke, it is not so much how the thing is done, how relief is brought in, but he magnifies the thing accomplished.<a name=190:27></a> Whereas Mark emphasis <i>how</i> the thing was accomplished, he tells us the Lord did everything <i>well</i>.<a name=190:28></a>

		Corinthians is obviously an adjusting epistle, for the apostle had had enquiries as to points of order.<a name=206:1></a> He is dealing not only with outward order, but the state that necessarily underlies it.<a name=206:2></a> Notice the large place that love has; saints should enquire as to whether they love God, for deep things are prepared for those that love Him (chapter 2).<a name=206:3></a> Then in chapter 8 it says if anyone love God the same is known of Him.<a name=206:4></a> In chapter 13 we get the great description of love, showing that one is nothing without it.<a name=206:5></a> Therefore we have the Supper also in this epistle, and at the end of chapter 16, "If any one love not the Lord Jesus Christ let him be Anathema Maranatha".<a name=206:6></a> Hence the epistle is largely made up of the great necessity for <i>love</i> in the things of God.<a name=206:7></a> The ending is Paul's way of emphasising his own estimate of Christ.<a name=206:8></a> When the Lord comes, he that loves Him not will be accursed; the present is not the time of the curse, but it will come, hence the terrible outlook for christendom.<a name=206:9></a> This epistle answers, in a way, to the Canticles of the Old Testament, for the Canticles end up with love for the little needy sister as well as for the bridegroom.<a name=206:10></a> This was wanting at Corinth; the great defect was the lack of love -- "Have love amongst yourselves".<a name=206:11></a> He has to speak of it as something more or less unknown to them.<a name=206:12></a>

		The picture of love presented in chapter 13 is the great essential for the working out of gift.<a name=206:13></a> It has to be spoken of in the abstract as it was not present in a concrete form, as, for instance, at Ephesus where he speaks of their love to <i>all saints</i>.<a name=206:14></a> It is quite right to have a desire for "spiritual manifestations", but without love it is like children playing with toys, and

		In all I have to say my wish is that through it we may be led into a clearer apprehension of the house of God.<a name=306:1></a> This book of Proverbs should be read with that in view, and that those who are to occupy that house are to be known and addressed -- for we should be addressed as we are known, as sons.<a name=306:2></a> In Hebrews the writer reminds his hearers of this, that this book of Proverbs addresses the saints as sons (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:5">Hebrews  12:5</a>).<a name=306:3></a> In remarking thus I would refer to the kingdom, for the writer of the book, although he presents himself as a son, also speaks of himself as king in Jerusalem (<a href="../bible/Ecclesiastes.htm#1:1">Ecclesiastes  1:1</a>).<a name=306:4></a> In other words the son is King.<a name=306:5></a> His kingship is therefore subservient to his sonship.<a name=306:6></a> The kingdom under his influence subserves the house.<a name=306:7></a> So that this book should be read in the light of the family and the house and may be rightly connected with John's gospel, as the book of Ecclesiastes may be rightly connected with Mark.<a name=306:8></a> In the book of Ecclesiastes the writer presents himself as the preacher, and as the preacher he was king.<a name=306:9></a> His kingly authority and resources would be subservient to his preaching.<a name=306:10></a> So that the preaching is sustained, in that way, with abundant resources.<a name=306:11></a> Right of way is guaranteed to all preachers, for the King has supreme control.<a name=306:12></a> So that in the shelter and protection of the kingdom He forms an assembly.<a name=306:13></a> Indeed, every preacher may be taken to represent one who forms an assembly, that in which divine intelligence and divine order and administration should appear.<a name=306:14></a> But, in Proverbs, it is, as I said, the Son, who not only is the Son of David, as born to David, but one peculiarly loved, as he says, "I was a son unto my father, tender and an only one in the sight of my mother", <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#4:3">Proverbs  4:3</a>.<a name=306:15></a> We have suggested

		It is a simple thing to say that the end in view in all God's operations is to bring about something for His own pleasure.<a name=327:3></a> The end in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#4:11">Revelation  4:11</a>, gives God's thought: "For thy will they were, and they have been created".<a name=327:4></a> This section, which deals with creation, is on that principle.<a name=327:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#5">Genesis  5</a>we have the reinstatement of Adam as head, ending in Enoch, the seventh from Adam, who represents what is for God's pleasure: "Before his translation he has the testimony that he had pleased God", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:5">Hebrews  11:5</a>.<a name=327:6></a> Perhaps the Lord would help us, in these days of recovery, that there should be full results, what is for the pleasure of God.<a name=327:7></a>

		What pleased God is seen in the very beginning; it appears at the outset.<a name=327:8></a> God sees the creation that it is "good"; then, it is "very good", the full result is reached.<a name=327:9></a> In the ways of God everything, whether good or bad, is worked out to finality.<a name=327:10></a> Jeremiah saw a basket of figs (<a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#24:2">Jeremiah  24:2</a>, 3), some very good figs, and some very bad; the present are the days when things are either very good or very bad.<a name=327:11></a>

		Of the four distinct features of recovery in this book, this one is the most important.<a name=343:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 5 recovery is seen in Adam, brought about by light which came in at the birth of Enosh (chapter 4: 26).<a name=343:2></a> His father discerned that man is mortal, and room was thus made for God.<a name=343:3></a> If man is dying, all is hopeless unless God comes in.<a name=343:4></a> The end of that was, that Enoch, the seventh from Adam, walked with God and did not see death; we see a full result in him.<a name=343:5></a> Death in that chapter emphasises the thought of life; the presence of death only brings out the power of life; death is ours; it only enhances the life that we have.<a name=343:6></a> So from that point of view, the great result would be that we walk with God; we afford pleasure to Him.<a name=343:7></a> Enoch had this testimony that he pleased God, and God took him.<a name=343:8></a> One would be so concerned that he should be so pleasing to God that He would take him.<a name=343:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Noah signifies rest; he brings in something for men that would be a comfort, a relief from toil; comfort comes in through Noah.<a name=343:10></a> Emerging from the ark on a clean earth he offers to God an offering of a sweet smelling odour, the burnt-offering, speaking of Christ.<a name=343:11></a> Noah is placed in formal relation to God by the bond which remains to this present time in the covenant.<a name=343:12></a> Noah brought through that which was for God.<a name=343:13></a> In the dove returning to Noah there was a testimony that she found no rest.<a name=343:14></a> There is the principle of discrimination in the dove, pointing to the time when the Lord Jesus should appear.<a name=343:15></a> The dove brings in the evidence of the work of God in the olive leaf "plucked off".<a name=343:16></a> It was not a floating leaf, it was "plucked off".<a name=343:17></a> We must take account of every bit of the work of God.<a name=343:18></a> Then the close relation

		to each other in the ark signifies the development of affections.<a name=344:1></a> Love delights in nearness.<a name=344:2></a> We are to get near to our brethren; we do not want to be separated from them.<a name=344:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We now come to Jacob to bring out the third feature of recovery.<a name=344:4></a> Jacob was a man fleeing for his life.<a name=344:5></a> The house of God comes in, in that connection.<a name=344:6></a> Jacob presents an extended feature of recovery.<a name=344:7></a> If we are fleeing from the face of our brother, the house of God comes in as a haven for us.<a name=344:8></a> There is here the great interest of heaven in one who is fleeing from his brother.<a name=344:9></a> Jacob had faith; he valued the birthright.<a name=344:10></a> Though he did not use the right way to obtain it, yet God knew he valued it.<a name=344:11></a> God makes promises without conditions.<a name=344:12></a> It involved an immense field of discipline when God said, "I will not leave thee until I have done what I have spoken to thee of" (chapter 28: 15).<a name=344:13></a> God in sovereign mercy takes us up, and it involves a lot of discipline to bring us through to His thought about us.<a name=344:14></a> He travels with us in all our paths, even in our devious ways; but He will not fail to make us feel that we are in them.<a name=344:15></a> The byways were used in the days of Deborah: "The travellers on highways went by crooked paths.<a name=344:16></a> The villages ceased in Israel, ceased until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel", <a href="../bible/Judges.htm#5:6">Judges  5:6</a>, 7.<a name=344:17></a> God takes account of our leaving the highway, and makes us feel it; the highway goes up to Zion, where all appear before God.<a name=344:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As Jacob is returning to his own land, before he reaches Bethel, he is much more concerned about Esau than about God.<a name=344:19></a> But God shows him that He is much more to be feared than Esau.<a name=344:20></a> He says as it were, 'Never mind Esau, get right with Me'.<a name=344:21></a> Jacob is greatly concerned as to how he is to meet Esau.<a name=344:22></a> He marshals his forces to make a good showing before Esau; but God met him and said, 'You have to do with Me'.<a name=344:23></a> Jacob valued the blessing.<a name=344:24></a> If you

	<div class="paragraph">
		The house of God is where God expresses His interest in us.<a name=345:2></a> It is not a building here, but the divine thought.<a name=345:3></a> He expresses His interest in you, the interest of heaven (read chapter 28: 10 - 22).<a name=345:4></a> The angels were interested in Jacob.<a name=345:5></a> Jehovah stood above the ladder and said, "The land on which thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed .<a name=345:6></a>.<a name=345:7></a>.<a name=345:8></a> I will not leave thee until .<a name=345:9></a>.<a name=345:10></a>.<a name=345:11></a>".<a name=345:12></a> God has His end in view, and He will not give it up (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#1:6">Philippians  1:6</a>); Christ's day is the day of display, when God has fully recovered man for His pleasure.<a name=345:13></a>

		"Whom the Lord loves he chastens", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:6">Hebrews  12:6</a>.<a name=345:14></a> "I have loved Jacob", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#9:13">Romans  9:13</a>.<a name=345:15></a> Jacob is a model of chastisement, and his end is wonderful; his sun goes down in a wonderful setting; he has the light of God in his soul, he worshipped.<a name=345:16></a> We may as well make up our minds to that.<a name=345:17></a> "Whom the Lord loves he chastens, and scourges every son whom he receives".<a name=345:18></a> The work of God underlies all this chastening.<a name=345:19></a> "Jacob .<a name=345:20></a>.<a name=345:21></a>.<a name=345:22></a> gathered his feet into the bed, and expired", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#49:33">Genesis  49:33</a>.<a name=345:23></a> It reminds you of the Lord's death; He died in power; Jacob in his death proved the presence of God with him.<a name=345:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At what point did God come into view on Jacob's return?<a name=345:25></a> It was when the wrestling was over, when Jacob said, "I will not let thee go except thou bless me" (chapter 32: 26).<a name=345:26></a> He always valued blessing from God.<a name=345:27></a> It will be observed that he had oil; he anointed the pillar with oil in Bethel twice (chapter 28: 18; 35: 14).<a name=345:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When Jacob awoke from his sleep on the first occasion of God meeting him at Bethel, he said, "How dreadful is this place!<a name=345:29></a>" In awakening he forms an estimate of the place, "Surely Jehovah is in this place, and I knew it not".<a name=345:30></a> Notice, "is" in it, not 'was'.<a name=345:31></a> This is another great feature in this subject,

		where God is.<a name=346:1></a> God has not left this earth.<a name=346:2></a> He has left a door open that He might enter any time.<a name=346:3></a> In <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2">Genesis  2</a>God does not finish creation, and leave it to work automatically.<a name=346:4></a> God comes in and gives impetus morally to all.<a name=346:5></a> Whatever may be said about 'nature' acting, faith connects everything with God.<a name=346:6></a> In the moral system God gives impetus to things.<a name=346:7></a> So Jacob said, "Jehovah is in this place .<a name=346:8></a>.<a name=346:9></a>.<a name=346:10></a> this is the gate of heaven"; heaven and earth are brought together; the house of God is the gate of heaven; it is morally near, not distant, "As the days of the heavens which are above the earth", <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#11:21">Deuteronomy  11:21</a>.<a name=346:11></a> The house of God is "above the earth".<a name=346:12></a> The vessel coming down from heaven was preparatory to the house of God; the house really took form under Paul.<a name=346:13></a> Peter's mind would run in an oblong or rectangular way, but the house is four-square; it is a universal thought.<a name=346:14></a> There are many assemblies, but one house.<a name=346:15></a> It is a test to be obliged to give a name to a thing of which the characteristics are presented.<a name=346:16></a> Jacob said, "This is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven".<a name=346:17></a> Adam was thus qualified, he could tell an animal's characteristics by looking at it, and could give it a name.<a name=346:18></a> The Father names all the families, He is "Father" to every family, and we are given names too; so, when Jacob gives the name, "This is .<a name=346:19></a>.<a name=346:20></a>.<a name=346:21></a> the house of God", it shows that he had sufficient insight to understand God's thought.<a name=346:22></a> Jacob arose early in the morning, the time of freshness; he set up the pillar, and poured oil on it.<a name=346:23></a>

		"The gate of heaven", is where heaven administers its will; the gate is where administration comes in, "God's dispensation, which is in faith", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#1:4">1 Timothy  1:4</a>.<a name=346:24></a> God is dispensing in His house; it is house-wise.<a name=346:25></a> There is consideration for everybody in God's house.<a name=346:26></a> We must not be harsh or critical, but consider for people, "Her husband is known in the gates" (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#31:23">Proverbs  31:23</a>);

		the assembly is the expression of Christ.<a name=347:1></a> Bethel stands out as a well-known landmark in the history of Israel; a spiritual witness to the people.<a name=347:2></a> You see the import of the spiritual thing; you name it.<a name=347:3></a> "This is none other but the house of God".<a name=347:4></a> Jacob reasoned it out and said, 'God is here'.<a name=347:5></a> You say, 'If God is not in this place, I must get out of it; if God is in this place, I must get into it'.<a name=347:6></a> It is the reflex of heaven, heaven brought down.<a name=347:7></a> In <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#2">1 Timothy  2</a>, Paul says, "I exhort therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings be made for all men" (heaven has an interest in all men); "for kings and all that are in dignity, that we may lead a quiet and tranquil life in all piety and gravity"; it shows what a place the house of God is.<a name=347:8></a> Solomon's temple was a place for prayer for all nations, "And as to the stranger also, who is not of thy people Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy name's sake (for they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy mighty hand, and of thy stretched-out arm); when he shall come and pray", <a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#8:41">1 Kings  8:41</a>, 42.<a name=347:9></a> God will accept his sacrifice; even the eunuch, God gives him a place within his walls.<a name=347:10></a> It is a place where He honours the people, and makes them joyful.<a name=347:11></a> From the time the house is brought in, it is His mind that His people should be joyful.<a name=347:12></a>

		The angels ascended and descended on the ladder.<a name=347:13></a> They ascend first, the movement begins where Jacob is: "the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:51">John  1:51</a>); here the ladder means constant communication between that place and heaven.<a name=347:14></a> Jehovah stood above the ladder, above it; it only emphasises the administration; He controls all that goes on.<a name=347:15></a> The idea of the ladder may suggest that there are degrees of nearness.<a name=347:16></a>

		Now in chapter 31: 13 it says, "Now arise .<a name=348:6></a>.<a name=348:7></a>.<a name=348:8></a> and return to the land of thy kindred"; God seeks to move Jacob out by the thought of his kindred.<a name=348:9></a> God sets before us inducements, in order to restore us; He reminds us of the land of our fathers.<a name=348:10></a> There are many of the people of God who can scarcely take in the thought of the house of God, but they can the thought of kindred.<a name=348:11></a> They are those that you love spiritually; you may be no longer with them; you may have wandered elsewhere, but the word is "Return .<a name=348:12></a>.<a name=348:13></a>.<a name=348:14></a> I will be with thee".<a name=348:15></a> The great thing is to have God with you (chapter 31: 3), "The Lord Jehovah, who gathereth the outcasts of Israel, saith: Yet will I gather others to him, with those of his that are gathered", <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#56:8">Isaiah  56:8</a>.<a name=348:16></a> God takes account of the outcasts.<a name=348:17></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#9">John  9</a>the man who was blind became an outcast; then the Lord met him, and gathered him in.<a name=348:18></a> "Watchman, what of the night?<a name=348:19></a> The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night, if ye will inquire, inquire; return, come", <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#21:11">Isaiah  21:11</a>, 12.<a name=348:20></a> God encourages you to return.<a name=348:21></a>

		Jacob was moved when Joseph was born (chapter 30: 25).<a name=349:2></a> Evidently, light came into his soul; God brings in the light of Christ; He is the One in whom the light is.<a name=349:3></a> The Holy Spirit uses Joseph at this early stage, as a figure of the One to come (chapter 33: 7); it is Joseph first, and then Rachel, when meeting Esau.<a name=349:4></a> Joseph is put before his mother; the Holy Spirit puts Christ first.<a name=349:5></a> So <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#9:6">Isaiah  9:6</a> says, "For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given"; Christ formed in us, is recovery; Christ beginning to take form in your soul; you know Him in the house.<a name=349:6></a>

		In chapter 32: 1, 2, the angels of God met Jacob on his way; a great testimony to the interest of heaven.<a name=349:7></a> And he said, "This is the camp of God.<a name=349:8></a> And he called the name of that place Mahanaim".<a name=349:9></a> He named the impression he received from God.<a name=349:10></a> "Two camps" -- it was adequate testimony; one man was the object of heaven's interest to that extent that two camps of angels met him.<a name=349:11></a>

		Esau was a big man, a man of the field; the man Jacob had wronged; he had, in truth, wronged him.<a name=349:12></a> Esau looms up before his mind in great proportions.<a name=349:13></a> God says, virtually, 'It is not Esau you have to do with, but with Me'; but there is gentleness, for He lets Jacob prevail.<a name=349:14></a> There are the sympathies of the Man; God approaches us in Christ.<a name=349:15></a>

		The Holy Spirit brings out the power of Jacob; the development in his soul; it is the power of the Spirit.<a name=349:16></a> One is to be in the house as a prince.<a name=349:17></a> This involves having power with God and with men.<a name=349:18></a> If you pray for a brother, or a company of saints, you get power with them.<a name=349:19></a> Israel corresponds with <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>; we are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit; the Spirit characterises the christian.<a name=349:20></a> Jacob limped, but "the sun rose upon him"; he was recovered.<a name=349:21></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ezekiel has a peculiar application at the present time as combining the government of God, which is universal and applies to every person in the world, and the direct work of God in His people, culminating in life in chapters 36 and 37, and in the city and the house in the later chapters.<a name=372:1></a> The book is marked by signs, corresponding in that respect with the gospel of John, with which, indeed, there is a remarkable analogy throughout.<a name=372:2></a> The signs were given through the prophet personally, and involved much personal suffering.<a name=372:3></a> He was identified in that way with the sufferings of the people of God, and took his place among the captives by the river Chebar.<a name=372:4></a> John was a "brother and fellow-partaker in the tribulation" in the Isle of Patmos.<a name=372:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The continual recurrence of the term "son of man" indicates that the Lord is seen acting in relation to all men; the promises to Israel are in abeyance, while divine operations are general and universal.<a name=372:6></a> Israel comes into view in the person of Nathanael in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>, who recognises the Lord as Son of God and King of Israel, and the Lord says, "Thou shalt see greater things than these .<a name=372:7></a>.<a name=372:8></a>.<a name=372:9></a> Henceforth ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man".<a name=372:10></a> While Israel's hopes are primarily in the Son of God and the King of Israel (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>), the Son of man (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>) has reference to the whole race of man.<a name=372:11></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>He is Son of man as lifted up from the earth to bear the judgment of man, and "Son of man who is in heaven".<a name=372:12></a> His universal dominion comes into view in chapter 12, and in chapter 13, when Judas went out, the Lord said, "Now is the

		Son of man glorified".<a name=373:1></a> The word of the Son of man is in relation to all men, so that blessing goes out to the whole race of man before Israel's hopes are realised as such.<a name=373:2></a> Israel will come in as we see in chapter 20, in Thomas, who recognised the Lord, not as King of Israel but as "My Lord and my God".<a name=373:3></a> In the last chapter of John the draught of the one hundred and fifty-three fishes would refer to the service of the Jewish remnant in the latter days; but blessing is secured for the whole race of man before the fulfilment of the promises to Israel.<a name=373:4></a> That is how the matter stands in Ezekiel as seen in the repeated reference to the Son of man.<a name=373:5></a>

		The heavens were opened to Ezekiel and he saw visions of God by the river Chebar.<a name=373:6></a> "The hand of Jehovah was there upon him", showing that these visions, and the support he was about to realise were far from Jerusalem, the centre of accredited religion on earth.<a name=373:7></a> In our times also we have God acting in sovereignty without regard to any particular centre.<a name=373:8></a> The hand of Jehovah upon him was by way of identification and support.<a name=373:9></a> Ezekiel on his part was fully identified with the people of God in their captivity, a point of great importance.<a name=373:10></a> Nehemiah is a good illustration of identification with God's people.<a name=373:11></a> In the government of God he was a cupbearer to the king, a position to be desired humanly speaking, but he was not occupied with that.<a name=373:12></a> He used the circumstances to help the people of God, not in a patronising way, but as identifying himself with them.<a name=373:13></a> It was the same with Ezra, and every man of God; they shared the afflictions of the people of God.<a name=373:14></a> Their position may have appeared to be against the people who were in captivity, but under God's government it was really for His people.<a name=373:15></a> So Daniel was exalted to a great place in the kingdom, also Mordecai and Esther.<a name=373:16></a> These identified themselves with the people of God in their exaltation,

		These captives had accepted the government of God in falling to the Chaldeans, and God promises to Jeremiah that their lives should be granted them for a prey: "Like these good figs, so will I regard for good them that are carried away captive of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans; and I will set mine eyes upon them for good", <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#24:5">Jeremiah  24:5</a>, 6.<a name=374:3></a> God is about to fulfil His promises in that connection by bringing in light through Ezekiel.<a name=374:4></a> As we accept the government of God in respect of failure, light comes in.<a name=374:5></a> It was so with Ezekiel and he got the mind of God, "The heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God".<a name=374:6></a> It is not now merely referring to Palestine, for the symbols here represent the agencies of divine government as affecting the whole world.<a name=374:7></a> This is what we have in the book of Revelation, the mind of God in regard of the whole earth.<a name=374:8></a> It gives the servant a wonderful place, but with it there is, on his part, the acceptance of the position the people are in.<a name=374:9></a> You suffer with the people of God, as being the depository of the mind of God.<a name=374:10></a> Nothing strengthens your heart more than to see what He is doing.<a name=374:11></a> The heavens are opened, and the heavens are co-extensive with the whole earth; God is extending His operations.<a name=374:12></a>

		As accepting the situation Ezekiel becomes the depository of the mind of God, and there is nothing now to puzzle him.<a name=375:16></a> He sees that God has power, no matter what the condition on man's side, to enforce His will universally.<a name=375:17></a> Things are constantly occurring in family, business, and international affairs, that would tend to overwhelm the people of God, but this would establish us as showing that God is working to one end.<a name=375:18></a> Ezra and Nehemiah also show the secret government of God operating in favour of His people.<a name=375:19></a> We may expect such revivals as those books indicate if we are in the light of Ezekiel.<a name=375:20></a> We see how they are brought about -- by public identification with the people of God.<a name=375:21></a> One might say, indeed, that there has been revival, in acknowledgment of God relative to His governmental dealings with the

		In the first chapter what the prophet saw was the glory of Jehovah.<a name=377:10></a> Above the expanse over the heads of the living creatures was the likeness of a throne and the appearance of a man upon it, and in verse 27 we read, "I saw as the look of glowing brass, as the appearance of fire, within it round about; from the appearance of his loins and upward, and from the appearance of his loins and downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire".<a name=377:11></a> The man has reference to Christ as He is now in heaven, and the appearance from the loins upward would suggest all that Christ is God-ward, and the appearance from His loins downward would refer to what He is man-ward; the fire is in keeping with the fact that we are in the presence of the governmental dealings of God.<a name=377:12></a> It is a wonderful scene and it enters into the present dispensation in a way that perhaps no other part of the Old Testament does, because it is heaven brought into view and what is in it, and its actions

		John's gospel begins at the end of the wilderness journey, because he is dealing with the subject of life.<a name=414:15></a> Emphasis is laid on the Spirit.<a name=414:16></a> So in <a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#37:1">Ezekiel  37:1</a> we read, "The hand of Jehovah was upon me, and Jehovah carried me out in the Spirit".<a name=414:17></a> It is not simply that Jehovah spoke to him, but that He carried him out in the Spirit.<a name=414:18></a> In chapters 3 to 6 of John's gospel the Lord is dealing with what is entirely spiritual in the great question of life, and many of His disciples went back and walked no more with Him, because this subject depends on the Spirit.<a name=414:19></a> The Spirit is spoken of more in Ezekiel than in any other prophet.<a name=414:20></a> The natural man is shut out.<a name=414:21></a>
