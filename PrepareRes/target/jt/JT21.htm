		J.T.<a name=1:5></a> I have been thinking of the Lord's <i>personal</i> service to the assembly, as indicated in the endings of the gospels, if that will be acceptable.<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord will make clear, perhaps, what is in one's mind.<a name=1:7></a> We have to distinguish between the Father's work, the Spirit's work, and the Lord's <i>personal</i> service, so that we might look at John 21 first.<a name=1:8></a> The distinction I suggested as to the work of divine Persons severally is, I think, indicated in the book of Genesis.<a name=1:9></a> The assembly as typified in Eve is the work of the Father, I apprehend.<a name=1:10></a> The Lord builded the woman and brought her complete to the man.<a name=1:11></a> The next type, which is Rebecca, is the work of the Spirit, which calls for decision.<a name=1:12></a> That is, the servant of Abraham brings her; he brings her to Isaac; he brings her by <i>testimony</i> to Isaac.<a name=1:13></a> The assembly is called out and attracted to Christ by the testimony of the Spirit.<a name=1:14></a> But when we come to Jacob we find a type of the Lord Himself moving.<a name=1:15></a> It says that "Jacob fled into the country of Syria".<a name=1:16></a> <a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#12:12">Hosea  12:12</a>.<a name=1:17></a> It was for a wife.<a name=1:18></a> It was, typically, a personal movement of the Lord's.<a name=1:19></a> And it says, "For a wife he kept sheep" <a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#12:12">Hosea  12:12</a>; and so, in the twenty years that ensued, Jacob was seen in continual toil, personal toil, serving fourteen years for his wives and six years for his flocks.<a name=1:20></a> No one else did it; he did it himself.<a name=1:21></a> And it occurred to me that the Lord can be apprehended in this light; and throughout the whole of the dispensation He is <i>personally</i> active in order to have the saints for Himself.<a name=1:22></a>

		The endings of the gospels, that is, the parts of the records that treat of the Lord's movements after He rose, indicate, I think, the service or activities of the Lord throughout the whole period of the assembly's sojourn on earth; that is, continuous service.<a name=2:1></a> I suggested John first, because coming in last he furnishes us with this feature to a greater extent than any of them, because he gives us not only the activities of the Lord, but <i>three</i> distinct manifestations, as we read here.<a name=2:2></a> It says, "This is already the third time that Jesus had been manifested to the disciples, being risen from among the dead".<a name=2:3></a> Three suggests perfect testimony as to the matter in hand, so that John emphasises the idea of manifestation, whether according to pure privilege and enjoyment for us, as in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:19">John  20:19</a>, or by way of rebuke, as in the case of Thomas, or in recovery after complete breakdown as in this chapter (21).<a name=2:4></a> In each instance we have a manifestation, so that from John's point of view, whatever breakdown happens it becomes an occasion of a manifestation.<a name=2:5></a> This chapter begins, not with Peter's movement -- a party movement, as I may call it -- the chapter does not begin with that; it begins with the thought of manifestation: "After these things Jesus manifested himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias.<a name=2:6></a> And he manifested himself thus".<a name=2:7></a> Then we have the history of the failure; but first there is the reference to a manifestation.<a name=2:8></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:12></a> This chapter has to do specially with those who serve, I think; those who are commissioned to serve.<a name=2:13></a> The movement was a movement of servants -- those who had that place.<a name=2:14></a> Recovery is seen in Peter.<a name=2:15></a> He is the sample man.<a name=2:16></a> And then John comes in after that and secures his place.<a name=2:17></a>

		J.F.<a name=3:6></a>S.<a name=3:7></a> Going back to what you said at the beginning, do you think that that aspect of the work of the Father in connection with Eve comes in in John's gospel, as it takes place before ever sin came into the world?<a name=3:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:9></a> Yes, I think Eve typifies the assembly as the <i>primary</i> thought of God.<a name=3:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:13></a> That is what I thought.<a name=3:14></a> It is brought in in Ephesians.<a name=3:15></a> That epistle contemplates the assembly as connected with the eternal purpose of God.<a name=3:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.F.<a name=3:17></a>S.<a name=3:18></a> Would you say we have coming to light in a very marked way what you have suggested -- the personal activities of Christ in relation to the assembly -- in the Song of Solomon?<a name=3:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:20></a> I think it is there -- that is the activity of love beginning with Himself, and drawn out in the affections of the bride.<a name=3:21></a> It is all personal between them.<a name=3:22></a> The Spirit is seen in Rebecca's case, I think.<a name=3:23></a> It is a matter of testimony.<a name=3:24></a> The testimony He brings down from heaven of Christ.<a name=3:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.B.<a name=3:26></a>McC.<a name=3:27></a> In Jacob's service in that way we have wonderful affection, serving for his wife.<a name=3:28></a> He is the suffering one, is he not?<a name=3:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:30></a> Quite.<a name=3:31></a> He has to go, as it were, afield.<a name=3:32></a> He went into the <i>country</i> of Syria.<a name=3:33></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:38></a> Yes, he was outside the confines of the town or village; it is the open field.<a name=3:39></a> The Lord in the Song of Solomon speaks of His locks being "wet with the dew of night" <a href="../bible/SongofSongs.htm#5:2">Song of Songs  5:2</a> -- exposure to the elements in order to secure the bride's affections.<a name=3:40></a> So that, when Jacob

		J.C.<a name=4:4></a> On the one hand the activity of the servant, and on the other the activity of the woman.<a name=4:5></a> It corresponds with the activity of Rebecca meeting the activity of the servant.<a name=4:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:7></a> I refer to all this as suggestive of the Lord's <i>personal</i> activities in the open field.<a name=4:8></a> Paul says, "I will not dare to speak of any of the things which Christ has not wrought by me" <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#15:8">Romans  15:8</a> -- not what <i>he</i> had wrought, but what <i>Christ</i> had wrought.<a name=4:9></a> Paul was the instrument, but Christ the Worker, so that he says, "from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ".<a name=4:10></a> <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#15:19">Romans  15:19</a>.<a name=4:11></a> It was a wide extent of territory, a wide field.<a name=4:12></a> It was fully traversed, and the assembly was secured in it.<a name=4:13></a> That activity goes on, and I believe the Lord would lay it upon the brethren to consider that it is a time of activity.<a name=4:14></a> It is not a time of sitting down in the light, precious though the light is, and of enjoying the light and privileges which the Lord indicates for us; there must be the corresponding activity.<a name=4:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		L.D.<a name=4:16></a>B.<a name=4:17></a> Do you suggest that the present activities of the Lord are through His servants in that way?<a name=4:18></a>

		J.T.<a name=4:19></a> Yes, "Going", it says, "<i>he</i> preached".<a name=4:20></a>

		L.D.<a name=4:21></a>B.<a name=4:22></a> So that Paul making a circuit would be as Jacob going into Syria.<a name=4:23></a> Is that the thought?<a name=4:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:25></a> Well, that is what comes to one.<a name=4:26></a> The word "country" I think, in the book of Hosea, would indicate that it is the open field; the country, not the town.<a name=4:27></a>

		Ques.<a name=5:6></a> How would you define the field today?<a name=5:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:8></a> Well, it is the whole of humanity.<a name=5:9></a> If we apply Matthew 13, the Lord has secured a right-of-way in it.<a name=5:10></a> He is not using it for any other purpose than to take out the assembly for the moment, and he has acquired a right-of-way by purchase; and so there is liberty to move about.<a name=5:11></a> For instance, he says "No man shall set on thee to hurt thee; for I have much people in this city (Corinth)", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#18:10">Acts  18:10</a>.<a name=5:12></a> You see, the Lord had His rights there, and He assured His servant that no one should set upon him to hurt him.<a name=5:13></a> The people should be reached and secured.<a name=5:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=5:15></a> In John 3 the Lord is seen as abiding in Judea and baptising with His disciples, and in the next chapter He baptised not, but His disciples.<a name=5:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:17></a> Yes, that would illustrate that what they were doing was His work.<a name=5:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.C.<a name=5:19></a> His activities went out a great deal.<a name=5:20></a> The country would bring in the thought that the shepherds would have been in the mind of God when, at the birth of Christ, they were keeping their flocks in the country.<a name=5:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:22></a> The great mass of humanity at that time had been moved into the cities and villages to be registered, but these were outside.<a name=5:23></a> I think Psalm 19 indicates the extent of the gospel as cited in Romans 10.<a name=5:24></a> It is universal.<a name=5:25></a> Their line has gone out through all the earth.<a name=5:26></a> It is a great thing to hold to a right principle, even though, through paralysis, you may be unable to carry it out.<a name=5:27></a> Never give up the principle.<a name=5:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.B.<a name=5:29></a> Is that what you had in your mind in connection with the chapter before us?<a name=5:30></a> The disciples were on a party line.<a name=5:31></a>

		H.B.<a name=6:4></a> I suppose there is nothing more destructive in the house of God than party lines?<a name=6:5></a>

		J.T.<a name=6:6></a> I think this is what this chapter opens up.<a name=6:7></a> But then we have the wonderful grace that speaks of a manifestation before that is dealt with.<a name=6:8></a> In allowing the thing a manifestation was in view, so that you not only have recovery, but the manifestation.<a name=6:9></a> A new feature comes out, for a manifestation from the Lord always implies an accession of light, something distinctive.<a name=6:10></a> They had never seen Him in this way before.<a name=6:11></a> They had never seen the Lord by Himself preparing a dinner for them.<a name=6:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		E.B.<a name=6:13></a>McC.<a name=6:14></a> Is it the character of a shepherd here?<a name=6:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:16></a> Very much.<a name=6:17></a> You see the point is "He manifested himself <i>thus</i>" I think in speaking of the Lord's manifestations some of us are too restricted.<a name=6:18></a> He does manifest Himself, according to <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:19">John  20:19</a>, as a matter of pure privilege, where there is nothing to rebuke.<a name=6:19></a> But then the next manifestation does involve rebuke -- not for all of them indeed, but for one of them.<a name=6:20></a> Doubtless they all enjoyed His presence in a general way, but Thomas was rebuked.<a name=6:21></a> Then in this third manifestation they are <i>all</i> wrong, and the grace of the thing is that the idea of a manifestation stands out at the outset.<a name=6:22></a> "He manifested himself thus".<a name=6:23></a> How?<a name=6:24></a> Well, the chapter goes on to say.<a name=6:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.K.<a name=6:26></a> Is a manifestation making Himself known?<a name=6:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:28></a> It is more than that.<a name=6:29></a> A manifestation, I think, involves that the Lord presents Himself in a new light.<a name=6:30></a> These three prove it, because there are no repetitions.<a name=6:31></a> Repetition is not characteristic of Christianity.<a name=6:32></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, the second manifestation is not said to have been on the first day of the week; it is <i>eight</i> days after.<a name=7:8></a> That is to say, it is not to call attention to privilege, as we speak.<a name=7:9></a> The first day of the week denotes that it is the day of supreme privilege for the assembly.<a name=7:10></a> The scene of the second was eight days after; that is to say, a period of exercise.<a name=7:11></a> The eighth day brings out the result of the period, and what comes out is that Thomas was there, he evidently not having benefited by the exercise of the previous privilege that the others enjoyed; and that is a word for all brethren who are not maintaining the light of their calling.<a name=7:12></a> Thomas was with them, but that did not help him.<a name=7:13></a> The fact that he was there did not remove his unbelief; he was still unbelieving.<a name=7:14></a> It was when the Lord said to Thomas, "reach hither thy hand .<a name=7:15></a>.<a name=7:16></a>.<a name=7:17></a> and be not faithless, but believing", <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:27">John  20:27</a> that he was convinced.<a name=7:18></a> Thus the Lord says, "Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed".<a name=7:19></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:29">John  20:29</a>.<a name=7:20></a> The fact that he was with them did not in itself help him.<a name=7:21></a>

		CHRIST'S PERSONAL SERVICE FOR THE SAINTS (2)

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=18:1></a> Perhaps we may continue our inquiry as to the Lord's present service by reading part of the last chapter of Luke, verses 13 to 53.<a name=18:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As remarked yesterday, the inquiry is as to the Lord's <i>personal</i> service to the saints throughout the whole period of our sojourn here upon the earth.<a name=18:3></a> The endings of the gospels afford a certain indication of His services, which may be taken, in their respective relations, to indicate His entire service; that is, His service in all its features.<a name=18:4></a> As we may, by the Lord's help, be enabled to look at Mark and Matthew later, it occurred to me that the order in which we are taking the gospels is appropriate for the reason that we are at the end of the dispensation.<a name=18:5></a> We are indebted primarily to John's ministry as understanding in measure the whole scope of the truth, for it is evidently the last gospel written; and, according to the reference made to John, he was intended to continue to the end, in some sort.<a name=18:6></a> So he stresses the <i>number</i> of manifestations.<a name=18:7></a> He only refers to a certain number; three distinct, as he calls them, manifestations; the last, as we considered yesterday, securing the recovery of the ministers.<a name=18:8></a> Peter was set up in the advantage of the third manifestation.<a name=18:9></a> Not only did he have part in all of them, but he was specially set up in the advantage of the third.<a name=18:10></a> In his primary position he was the leading apostle, and enlarged his failure in leading the others; but is reinstated in his primary position.<a name=18:11></a> The Lord commits to him what was supremely precious to Himself; that is to say, His lambs and His sheep.<a name=18:12></a> To John He committed His

		mother.<a name=19:1></a> But Peter has the charge of the lambs and the sheep -- "<i>my</i> lambs" and "<i>my</i> sheep".<a name=19:2></a> He has to feed them and shepherd them.<a name=19:3></a> No greater thing could be committed to anyone than that.<a name=19:4></a> He had not received the mystery -- that was a later charge reserved for Paul, one who stands by himself; but of the twelve, Peter is reinstated in the full confidence of the Lord.<a name=19:5></a> He has His unreserved confidence after the manifestation.<a name=19:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, Luke, in the record which we have read, is not concerned so much with <i>leading</i> brothers or ministers.<a name=19:7></a> The two that are specially singled out are not apostles.<a name=19:8></a> There is nothing, indeed, to indicate that they had any special ministry.<a name=19:9></a> They were just "two of them".<a name=19:10></a> Not two of the twelve, but two of the company; and they were doing nothing out of the way, as we speak.<a name=19:11></a> They were on a journey -- sixty furlongs (this is noted); not to any place of importance.<a name=19:12></a> There is no evidence that they intended to go into the world.<a name=19:13></a> Many slip away, as we may say, in difficult circumstances, without any intentional desire to go into the world, as such; for Emmaus suggests something obscure.<a name=19:14></a> The word denotes what is obscure; either the people or the place.<a name=19:15></a> But they had their backs on Jerusalem.<a name=19:16></a> They may be taken thus as typical of ordinary Christians who may turn aside, not in any bad sense; but, nevertheless, turn aside; of whom, alas!<a name=19:17></a> there are many at the present time.<a name=19:18></a> The ministry that is indicated in this chapter is intended for such.<a name=19:19></a> The length to which the Lord would go in His gracious service for most obscure Christians -- not for a great apostle, or a John, or a Thomas, but obscure ones -- is in view.<a name=19:20></a> The name of one of them is given.<a name=19:21></a> It is simply he is <i>called</i> that.<a name=19:22></a> He was evidently not a known brother, a brother of renown; he was just an ordinary one.<a name=19:23></a> But the Lord shows in this service that the most obscure of His people, occupied by perhaps the most obscure surroundings,

		J.T.<a name=20:15></a> They were not worldlings; they were not careless persons; they had an interest, for they were thinking of the Lord and of His death.<a name=20:16></a> Nevertheless, they were definitely leaving Jerusalem, and they knew where they were going -- to another town sixty furlongs away.<a name=20:17></a>

		J.T.<a name=20:27></a> That is what I think is emphasised.<a name=20:28></a> The Lord moves; then the breaking of bread (He appeared unto them in this); and then it is the Scriptures.<a name=20:29></a> He speaks to them of the Scriptures by the way, and then afterwards He opens to them the Scriptures, and expounds them to them.<a name=20:30></a>

		J.T.<a name=35:1></a> I think we might look at the last chapter of Mark this afternoon.<a name=35:2></a> What we have before us in these readings may be again mentioned for the benefit of those who have not been with us.<a name=35:3></a>

		First, the bearing of the Lord's activities on the whole dispensation after He rose and during the period of His stay here before He ascended; the thought being that His then services indicated what His services should be spiritually -- and, I may say, mediately -- during the whole dispensation.<a name=35:4></a> So that we began with John, because he lays stress on these manifestations of the Lord, saying that there were three.<a name=35:5></a> He does not imply that there were not more than three, but three sufficed to indicate the complete evidence.<a name=35:6></a> Paul mentions more than three, as we have already noted elsewhere, in order, as I apprehend, to point out the constructive nature of the Lord's manifestations.<a name=35:7></a> John mentions three as adequate witness; and then, in connection with the last, he records what we may call a general breakdown; that is, a breakdown in the leaders; for they are the ones who go astray and lead astray.<a name=35:8></a> The lambs are not mentioned as needing shepherding in John 21.<a name=35:9></a> We had before us that the sheep need the shepherding, and the fact that Peter and his company had gone astray and led astray was evidence of that.<a name=35:10></a> So that the leaders are restored; at least, the leading one amongst them is restored, and he is entrusted with the care of the lambs and the sheep.<a name=35:11></a> He is also reminded that, whilst he is entrusted with the lambs and the sheep, he is not entrusted with his fellow labourers.<a name=35:12></a> With John it is not a question of forming

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two great features in connection with the ordering of the public assembly, as the first epistle to the Corinthians emphasises and amplifies -- the Scriptures and the breaking of bread.<a name=36:2></a> So that Luke, whilst developing the public assembly, finishes up with <i>witnesses</i>, not preachers.<a name=36:3></a> And a witness of Christ such as Luke presents must not be a cast-down, disconsolate person.<a name=36:4></a> None such can be a witness of Christ.<a name=36:5></a> Luke would light up the countenance and bring in a heavenly appearance.<a name=36:6></a> The point is -- the kind of persons to be witnesses of Christ.<a name=36:7></a> Not a question of gift exactly, but of formation.<a name=36:8></a> The passage we read yesterday begins with sad countenances and disconsolate conversation, and it ends with happy believers, worshipping believers, believers that were happy in a spiritual way, in the temple, praising and blessing God.<a name=36:9></a> And that, dear brethren, is what I think we should take account of in Luke; and it includes all the members of the company.<a name=36:10></a> In order to be witnesses we must be sanctified and anointed, because the anointing really is the outcome of what is inward.<a name=36:11></a> And so I suggested the gospels in this order.<a name=36:12></a> In Mark we have not the formation of the company, but the <i>preachers</i>.<a name=36:13></a> He has the preachers in view.<a name=36:14></a> So the services or manifestations of the Lord in Mark have in view that there should be preachers.<a name=36:15></a> I think it would help to have the matter before us clearly thus, so that we may understand what is here in this passage.<a name=36:16></a>

		In order to have government there must be respect; and this not only for the Lord, but for all who have moral power.<a name=52:9></a> "Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#5:17">1 Timothy  5:17</a>.<a name=52:10></a> So the Scriptures -- the Old Testament Scriptures -- furnish us with examples of the acquirement of moral power.<a name=52:11></a> Those who had an official place accredited of God had earlier qualified for the place on moral grounds.<a name=52:12></a> We find as an illustration that Joseph, who typifies the Lord in a peculiar way as in administration, in his dream, which he tells his brethren, and which elicits their hatred, says, "we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#37:7">Genesis  37:7</a>.<a name=52:13></a> That refers to inherent power.<a name=52:14></a> It is a remarkable thing that a <i>sheaf</i> should stand up.<a name=52:15></a> Whatever the growth may have been, the sheaf had been cut down; so that there was the power of life.<a name=52:16></a> It was not set up by another.<a name=52:17></a> No, it <i>stood</i> up.<a name=52:18></a> The suggestion is not conferred authority --

		CHRIST'S PERSONAL SERVICE FOR THE SAINTS (5)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=71:1></a> I have been thinking that, to complete the series of readings we have had, we should look at chapter 1 of the Acts.<a name=71:2></a> It occurred to me that this scripture is necessary to complete the inquiry we have had, because it gives an additional feature of the Lord's activities during his stay amongst them, telling us the number of days -- namely, forty.<a name=71:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think that, among other things, what He had in view was to prepare them for the Spirit.<a name=71:4></a> We have had the idea of manifestation in John; he enlarges on the idea of manifestation, which involves accession of light.<a name=71:5></a> Then Luke, as we have seen, takes account of the feeblest of the Lord's people as essential in the public gathering, to the end that there should be a witness.<a name=71:6></a> The saints should be a witness to Christ.<a name=71:7></a> Then in Mark, that there should be individual faith, and preaching; and in Matthew, that there should be an administrative company.<a name=71:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But it remained to be seen what the Lord's stay had in view in regard of the <i>Spirit;</i> that the saints should be available to the Spirit; might know how to make room for Him; and, I may say, use the Spirit in their service.<a name=71:9></a> We find at the outset that the Lord, <i>by the Holy Spirit</i>, charged the apostles whom He had chosen.<a name=71:10></a> This is a feature which is not mentioned in the gospels, that the charge was by the Spirit.<a name=71:11></a> Then we read that He presented Himself <i>living</i> with many proofs after He suffered, and that He assembled with them.<a name=71:12></a> The point is not so much the resurrection (the resurrection is assumed of course), but it is not so much emphasised as the fact that He had suffered, had charged them by the Spirit,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=72>[Page 72]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and had assembled with them.<a name=72:1></a> So that it seems to me our consideration today should be how the Lord's service, after He rose, bore on the dispensation in regard to the assembly, and the Spirit in the assembly.<a name=72:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.C.<a name=72:3></a>S.<a name=72:4></a> Would that be that He was handing the saints over to the Spirit, in a way preparing them for the fact that He was giving them charge of all things in His absence?<a name=72:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=72:6></a> Well, they would also understand how to act in the Spirit.<a name=72:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.C.<a name=72:8></a>S.<a name=72:9></a> So that all that came out in the four gospels which we have considered would now become a possibility amongst them by the Spirit coming.<a name=72:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=72:11></a> Yes.<a name=72:12></a> The Spirit would be here.<a name=72:13></a> The Lord acted by the Spirit during His service on earth, but the model should be after He rose.<a name=72:14></a> After He rose He charged them by the Spirit, so that throughout the dispensation those who serve were to understand how to act by the Spirit.<a name=72:15></a> They would learn from Him by that action.<a name=72:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.C.<a name=72:17></a>S.<a name=72:18></a> We see that, His having charged them in that way, they were to learn morally from Him how to do things in the Spirit.<a name=72:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=72:20></a> The use (to speak reverently) that may be made of the Spirit by the believer, as to his individual experience or in his service, is perhaps but little understood; whereas all activity and energy during the dispensation is to be by the Spirit.<a name=72:21></a> The assembly is the vessel of the Spirit.<a name=72:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.F.<a name=72:23></a>S.<a name=72:24></a> Each instance in the gospels that we have had before, is the continuation of what is seen in Christ in the assembly now; so here He showed unto them the way in which they could use the Spirit, that they might value the assembly in that way.<a name=72:25></a>

		I have in mind tonight to speak of the maintenance of church or assembly conditions and relations.<a name=102:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was the divine thought that the assemblies, as set up under Paul, should be maintained at the full height of their original status.<a name=102:2></a> We know, alas, that historically it was far otherwise; but we see in these passages how the assemblies were, for a time, maintained so as to be available to God and to Christ and to the Spirit.<a name=102:3></a> There was to be from the outset, under Paul's service, a universal unity; and there was to be, at the same time, what I may call local autonomy.<a name=102:4></a> So, as Paul goes into the service, Peter, evidently under the influence and direction of the Lord, moved to bring the work of God among the Jews into accord with the new movement that had begun, so that there should not be, so to speak, one railroad laid for Judaea and another for the provinces outside of Judaea.<a name=102:5></a> Most of us will be aware of irregularity in railroad grades, if you will allow me a homely illustration.<a name=102:6></a> And I apprehend that Peter, as he discerned the new movement under Paul, hastened to extend the grade, that communication should be unhampered.<a name=102:7></a> Hence he told Aeneas to rise and make his bed for himself.<a name=102:8></a> That was a feature that was about to become general.<a name=102:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The assemblies set up under Paul were all marked by local self-maintenance, as I may say.<a name=102:10></a> If others came -- and they did, as we see in these passages -- all well; but it was never the divine thought that local companies should not be, as it were, self-supporting; so Peter says to Aeneas, "Rise up, and make thy couch for thyself", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:34">Acts  9:34</a>.<a name=102:11></a> The assemblies of Judaea were to learn that they should not be henceforth

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I mention these things, dear brethren, because, if there is to be the maintenance of assembly conditions and relations, we must understand how to arise and make our beds for ourselves.<a name=103:6></a> It is not that God is in any way shut out by this principle -- far otherwise.<a name=103:7></a> For the apostle writes to the Philippians (the first European assembly formed), "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling: for it is God who works in you both the willing and the working according to his good pleasure", <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:12">Philippians  2:12</a>,13.<a name=103:8></a> They were to be deprived of the great support of the apostle, and they were to learn how to work out their own salvation.<a name=103:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there had to be the <i>willing;</i> and I raise this question, dear brethren, as several companies of the Lord's people are represented here.<a name=103:10></a> God looks for the <i>willing</i>.<a name=103:11></a> There could be no divine support aside from the <i>willing;</i> as Isaiah says, "If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land", <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#1:19">Isaiah  1:19</a>.<a name=103:12></a> But God works to that end.<a name=103:13></a> He works in us for the willing.<a name=103:14></a> It is a long process with many of us, but God is wonderfully patient.<a name=103:15></a> How He waits upon us; and how He allows circumstances to come about in connection with each of us so that there should be the willing!<a name=103:16></a> There can be no possible progress in the working out of our own salvation apart from the willing.<a name=103:17></a> There must be entire submission

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God had graciously anticipated that event, and had provided for the maintenance of the several local companies throughout the world.<a name=104:5></a> Hence Peter, evidently under the direction of the Lord, went to "all quarters".<a name=104:6></a> He, with the others, had remained at Jerusalem, but now he moves out and visits all quarters.<a name=104:7></a> In his epistle, having established this principle, we find him writing to the Jews of the dispersion, saying, in effect, "You are yourselves living stones; you are yourselves a holy priesthood; you are qualified to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Christ Jesus".<a name=104:8></a> That was an amplification of his word to Aeneas.<a name=104:9></a> He says that not only were they responsible to make their bed for themselves, but they were furnished divinely for all that was requisite for the worship of God.<a name=104:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Writing from Babylon, having established these great principles of local responsibility and the maintenance of assembly relations locally, he proceeds to unify the work of God.<a name=104:11></a> He writes to the brethren of the dispersion in Asia Minor, "She that is elected with you in Babylon, salutes you", <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#5:13">1 Peter  5:13</a>.<a name=104:12></a> You see, dear brethren, how, in the maintenance of assembly conditions and relations, the great leaders, qualified of God to minister to the assembly, maintained not only these local relations, but general or universal unity, so that, to use my homely figure, a train could go right from Rome to Babylon.<a name=104:13></a>

		Peter later says, "Our beloved brother Paul", <a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#3:15">2 Peter  3:15</a>.<a name=105:17></a> You see how he links in affection the whole work of God in his epistle -- the whole work of God in connection with himself and the other eleven, and then Paul and Barnabas and their co-workers.<a name=105:18></a> The whole work of God is linked up in affection in that beautiful expression, "As our beloved brother Paul also has written to you according to the wisdom given to him", <a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#3:15">2 Peter  3:15</a>.<a name=105:19></a> Now, I mention these things because I see the need of them in myself and in all.<a name=105:20></a> Moving about I see the enormous influence

		Well, now I come to the passage in Acts 15 to show how, as Peter had wrought for local and general maintenance of assembly conditions, so Paul, as he says, "laboured more than they all".<a name=106:2></a> And hence he says to Barnabas, "Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they do", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#15:36">Acts  15:36</a>.<a name=106:3></a> What an interesting record, dear brethren, as to this beloved man; and what a model we have in him for service -- a model for everyone with any little ability to serve Christ!<a name=106:4></a> Did it ever come into your heart to visit your brethren and see how they do?<a name=106:5></a> You say, 'I have no gift'.<a name=106:6></a> But you can go and "see how they do".<a name=106:7></a> It is not a question of gift for the moment, but a question of affection.<a name=106:8></a> He says, "Let us visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they do".<a name=106:9></a> Brethren, what about this?<a name=106:10></a> How does this comport with sitting down in your own locality, content with the routine of weekly meetings?<a name=106:11></a> What about those meetings that are rarely visited?<a name=106:12></a> Has it ever come into your heart to say, "Let us visit our brethren, .<a name=106:13></a>.<a name=106:14></a>.<a name=106:15></a> and see how they do"?<a name=106:16></a> You say, 'I have no gift'.<a name=106:17></a> But "Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend", <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#27:17">Proverbs  27:17</a>.<a name=106:18></a> I look at that countenance of Stephen.<a name=106:19></a> He is not presented to us in Scripture as a man of gift; he is a martyr.<a name=106:20></a> He is a man who laid down his life for the testimony.<a name=106:21></a> I look at his countenance as he stands there in the sanhedrim.<a name=106:22></a> They had to witness to it; it was as the countenance of an angel.<a name=106:23></a> If he never spoke a word to you, he would encourage you; and so, as I said, it is not exactly a question of gift; it is a question of affection.<a name=106:24></a> Can we allow our brethren to go

		Now, having said so much to make our position clear at the outset, I wish to refer to the book of Genesis for a moment, so that we may gather up the divine intent in the heavens.<a name=112:4></a> It is said, "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:1">Genesis  1:1</a>.<a name=112:5></a> It does not appear that the heavens were involved in the great disaster that ensued, for it immediately says, "the earth was without form and void", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:2">Genesis  1:2</a>.<a name=112:6></a> It says nothing about the heavens being thus.<a name=112:7></a> There was subsequently what was called "the expanse"; God separating the waters from the waters by it; referring to what we know as the atmospheric heavens -- the sidereal heavens being beyond.<a name=112:8></a> "God called the expanse Heavens" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:8">Genesis  1:8</a>) -- those that affect us materially and physically; including, I apprehend, the sidereal region.<a name=112:9></a>

		But what lends all its precious meaning to that event, to my mind, lies in the fact that the first speaking from heaven is after Isaac was born.<a name=113:6></a> The heavens are mentioned earlier, but their direct action on the earth was judgment, for their windows were opened to pour out judgment -- a sorrowful consideration.<a name=113:7></a> The earth seemed to have been in measure independent of them, for we are told that the first watering of the earth was from itself.<a name=113:8></a> I have no doubt that in that God reminds us of our sufficiency as having the Spirit.<a name=113:9></a> But then, heaven must have its place; and before it <i>speaks</i> Isaac is born.<a name=113:10></a> We can easily fit that in with the birth of the Lord here on earth.<a name=113:11></a> Heaven can speak freely as He appeared here.<a name=113:12></a> The heavens were opened, we are told, at His baptism, and the voice came: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#3:17">Matthew  3:17</a>.<a name=113:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have it before me to speak about life from the standpoint of the passage in Romans 8, which contemplates it in the believer as having the Spirit.<a name=121:1></a> It says, "The Spirit is life on account of righteousness".<a name=121:2></a> From that point of view I wish to present it as an energetic force in the believer, and to say that all energy in us that is acceptable to God must issue from the Spirit.<a name=121:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Life is, as most of us know, also presented in Scripture as an objective idea -- something set before us to be entered into.<a name=121:4></a> But the passage I have read contemplates it in its subjective potentiality, and I have in mind to refer for a moment to Jacob, as illustrative of it from this point of view.<a name=121:5></a> He is indeed a type of most of us, even before we receive the Spirit; or, as having received Him, before we understand how to make room for Him as power -- divinely given power -- in our souls.<a name=121:6></a> As "born again" a man has certain instincts that are spiritual, as it is said, "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit", <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:6">John  3:6</a>.<a name=121:7></a> It may show itself negatively, but it is there.<a name=121:8></a> It marks the man off as distinct from the mere natural man.<a name=121:9></a> There is that in him which is designated by the Lord's own word as 'spirit', and I take Jacob to illustrate the instinct peculiar to it, although perhaps uncontrolled and unintelligible in him; nevertheless, they are expressed: "He took his brother by the heel", <a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#12:3">Hosea  12:3</a>.<a name=121:10></a> There was a struggle, indeed, between them before their birth -- a remarkable thing; and I have no doubt that it has its counterpart in any young ones who have just received being by the power of God.<a name=121:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=122>[Page 122]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a distinct instinct in the soul that the natural man must be supplanted, and so Jacob received his name as the supplanter.<a name=122:1></a> For the natural comes first in historical order, as Esau did, and "afterwards that which is spiritual".<a name=122:2></a> <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:46">1 Corinthians  15:46</a>.<a name=122:3></a> Jacob represented the spiritual, as yet unintelligible in him, but nevertheless in such wise as to supplant, in principle, the natural.<a name=122:4></a> His subsequent relations with Esau, as most of us know, were not marked by spiritual rectitude; nevertheless he was true to his instincts.<a name=122:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I speak to the young ones here who may be troubled, and I would say there is great encouragement in taking notice of your instincts.<a name=122:6></a> There may be much that you regret -- that causes you pain, and others as well; still the entry of your way, to use a scriptural expression (Proverbs) is marked by spiritual instincts that have a distinct bearing Godward.<a name=122:7></a> Jacob kept steadily to these instincts, and so the prophet draws attention to the fact that first of all he took hold of his brother by the heel.<a name=122:8></a> His next great energy, which brought him on to the ground of the Spirit, was that he wrestled with God.<a name=122:9></a> It says, "He had power with God", <a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#12:3">Hosea  12:3</a>.<a name=122:10></a> "He had power over the angel, and prevailed", <a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#12:4">Hosea  12:4</a>.<a name=122:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I wish especially to address young believers here.<a name=122:12></a> I wish to encourage you by pointing out that whatever you may experience to distress you, you must take account of the spiritual instincts that mark one "born again".<a name=122:13></a> These are born, not of nature; they are of the Spirit.<a name=122:14></a> But what I would especially call attention to is that Jacob wrestled with God.<a name=122:15></a> We must not be content with a mixed condition in our souls, which is likely to lead to such deceit as marked Jacob in his displacement of his brother.<a name=122:16></a> The Spirit of God in Hosea passes over a long period, of Jacob's life, and then says, "he wrestled with God".<a name=122:17></a> Many of us, doubtless, have spent that long period, or even longer, in a state of spiritual uncertainty.<a name=122:18></a>

		Yet those who have observed us have been assured that we have been born again because of our spiritual inclinations.<a name=123:1></a> You love the society of the people of God; you love the Scriptures; you revere the name of Jesus; you resent any insult to Him.<a name=123:2></a> Nevertheless, your spiritual experience is a mixed one.<a name=123:3></a> It may be, like Jacob, that you turn aside into the world, but God never withdraws His eye from one born again.<a name=123:4></a> The work that He begins He finishes.<a name=123:5></a> And so the Spirit here passes over a long chequered experience, and notes the wrestling with God.<a name=123:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You know, dear brethren, the great difficulty with many of us is the want of energy.<a name=123:7></a> The gospel presents to us clearly what is available.<a name=123:8></a> Think of what has been brought within our range in the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ, and in His death!<a name=123:9></a> The gospel brings to our attention what is thus available.<a name=123:10></a> Everything is presented to a believer as available to him in Christ.<a name=123:11></a> Every blessing that God has for man is available, and particularly life, for that is what is most urgent after forgiveness.<a name=123:12></a> Hence God promised it, and commanded it.<a name=123:13></a> He promised it in view of man's need, and desire to have it.<a name=123:14></a> He commanded it, because the exigencies of His nature required that man should live before Him.<a name=123:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus it is presented as available, and hence the next thing is energy.<a name=123:16></a> It says, Jacob "wrestled with God".<a name=123:17></a> He had heard that Esau was coming with four hundred men.<a name=123:18></a> He was distressed in soul.<a name=123:19></a> He divided his belongings into troops, and sent them on.<a name=123:20></a> But all the time the nightmare of an army of four hundred men, commanded by an outraged brother, was in his mind, and he was left alone, and the angel wrestled with him.<a name=123:21></a> God begins the transaction, but Jacob says, "I will not let thee go, except thou bless me", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#32:26">Genesis  32:26</a>.<a name=123:22></a>

		What I have in view tonight is to speak about the Spirit as the fruit of His work is seen among the saints collectively.<a name=215:1></a> I have in mind a passage in the book of Proverbs, well known to many of us, but which illustrates what I have in mind to develop out of these scriptures I have read.<a name=215:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#30:29">Proverbs  30:29</a> - 31, it is said there are four things that are "comely in going".<a name=215:3></a> The first is a lion, "which turneth not away for any"; and the second is "a greyhound", or perhaps more correctly a warhorse, who would be aggressive, who "smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains and the shouting", <a href="../bible/Job.htm#39:25">Job  39:25</a>.<a name=215:4></a> Then there is "an he-goat also; and a king, against whom there is no rising up".<a name=215:5></a> These are features that the shrewd observer in that chapter takes account of.<a name=215:6></a> He had also been speaking of four things that disquiet the earth, under which indeed the earth cannot bear up; which four things are visible today in a marked way to all those who have spiritual discernment.<a name=215:7></a> Then he speaks about four things which are little but "exceeding wise", answering to the present work of the Spirit in the people of God bringing about a sense of our outward smallness, and yet a state of wisdom.<a name=215:8></a> "They are exceeding wise".<a name=215:9></a> Then the writer says there are four things which are marked by stateliness in their going, and I wish to speak particularly of them.<a name=215:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish to point out something of the features of these four stately creatures from these scriptures I have read in Numbers; they are the product of the Spirit of God; for no one save one who is trained under Christ and knows bow to use the Spirit will

		stand up against all comers.<a name=216:1></a> "Who turneth not away for any", it says.<a name=216:2></a> So the warhorse, who, instead of avoiding the conflict, smells it afar off and is ready for it.<a name=216:3></a> He is ready even to be aggressive if necessary in the interests of Christ.<a name=216:4></a> Then the he-goat speaks of one who can be isolated, who can be apart from the influences of this world, who can retire and be with God; indicating his complete independence of this world, and who is thus wholly free from its influence, and hence comes out in the moral authority and power of a king.<a name=216:5></a> No one can rise up against him.<a name=216:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These are features, dear brethren, that the Holy Spirit would develop amongst us.<a name=216:7></a> I read the passage in Numbers 21 because it speaks about <i>assembling</i>.<a name=216:8></a> The Lord said to Moses, "Assemble the people, and I will give them water", <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21:16">Numbers  21:16</a>.<a name=216:9></a> It is the Spirit coming in as available in the company.<a name=216:10></a> Last evening we dwelt on the Spirit as seen in Joshua, who is spoken of as a man who had the Spirit -- a man -- one who has attained, we may say, to spiritual manhood.<a name=216:11></a> But when we turn to this passage, what is in view is not what is individual, but what is collective.<a name=216:12></a> So that it is, "Assemble the people, and I will give them water".<a name=216:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God Himself had the thought of His people assembling.<a name=216:14></a> So we see in Acts 1 the Lord assembled with His disciples, and He charged them by the Spirit.<a name=216:15></a> He then set before them how the Spirit was to be employed, to speak reverently.<a name=216:16></a> He had enjoined His disciples that they should wait until they received the Spirit.<a name=216:17></a> They were to tarry in the city of Jerusalem until they were clothed with power from on high.<a name=216:18></a> If they were to be His representatives they were to be clothed with power from on high.<a name=216:19></a> They were in themselves weak, but they were to be here in the same power in which He executed His service in this world.<a name=216:20></a> It was no less than that;

		indeed He said, "Greater works than these shall he do because I go to my Father", <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:12">John  14:12</a>.<a name=217:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, I want to show you, dear brethren, if I can, with the Lord's help, how these thoughts work out in the passages I have read, and what I would say first of all is that we should learn how to assemble.<a name=217:2></a> If we are to go in for this power, the power that worketh in us, the power that is greater than he that is in the world, we must begin by assembling.<a name=217:3></a> That is, we must dismiss from our minds independence.<a name=217:4></a> The spirit of individual independence is wholly incompatible with the idea of assembling.<a name=217:5></a> We have to learn to come together in subjection to Christ, and not only to Christ, but in subjection to one another.<a name=217:6></a> You cannot have the assembly without subjection to Christ and subjection to one another.<a name=217:7></a> We have the idea in Peter of the younger being subject to the elder; and then we have following, "All of you bind on humility towards one another", <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#5:5">1 Peter  5:5</a>.<a name=217:8></a> When a thing is bound on it is intended to remain, not to be worn on special occasions only; it is to remain, it is bound on.<a name=217:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So we find here in Numbers that they sing; the people sing, "Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it", As the principle of assembling is accepted, and we are together in assembly, the Spirit of God is recognised.<a name=217:10></a> He is not only recognised doctrinally, he is recognised feelingly.<a name=217:11></a> The idea of singing is feeling.<a name=217:12></a> "I will sing with the Spirit", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14:15">1 Corinthians  14:15</a> the apostle says; that means that I sing feelingly.<a name=217:13></a> So they sing to the well; the Spirit is, so to speak, feelingly recognised.<a name=217:14></a> "Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it".<a name=217:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then it says, "The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it, by the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves".<a name=217:16></a> I want to dwell on that for a moment, for young ones have to learn what the lawgiver means.<a name=217:17></a> Many of us are puzzled; many of us are inquiring as to whether we have the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=218>[Page 218]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Spirit.<a name=218:1></a> Let us begin by inquiring as to whether we are absolutely subject to Christ; if so we are sure to get the Spirit.<a name=218:2></a> "The princes digged the well".<a name=218:3></a> These are men who have acquired power and renown among the saints.<a name=218:4></a> They employ their staves; suggestive, I apprehend, of their experience.<a name=218:5></a> But they dig the well under the direction of the lawgiver, for however influential a brother may be through the exercise of his gift, however much moral weight he may have acquired among saints, he has to come back to the lawgiver.<a name=218:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Abroad in what is called Christendom there is power, no one can deny it; we thank God for it.<a name=218:7></a> We are not to interfere with it, for as the Lord said, "He that is not against us is for us".<a name=218:8></a> <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#9:40">Mark  9:40</a>.<a name=218:9></a> But then what about the lawgiver?<a name=218:10></a> If you claim to have power, I am entitled to raise the question with you as to what place the lawgiver has in connection with your power, for one great principle with God in the exercise of power is that it must be under law.<a name=218:11></a> If power is not regulated by law we are sure to come to disaster.<a name=218:12></a> That is true in physical things as it is in spiritual things.<a name=218:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If I take the physical creation, the physical universe, and take away the law that governs it, what would happen?<a name=218:14></a> The answer is obvious.<a name=218:15></a> So in regard to the power that is exercised here in this world in the Lord's name; unless there is the recognition of the lawgiver we are sure to come to disaster.<a name=218:16></a> Hence the princes here, although in power, respect the lawgiver.<a name=218:17></a> That is to say, the Spirit, as known collectively, is known in those who observe the lawgiver.<a name=218:18></a> "At the direction of the lawgiver" they digged the well.<a name=218:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So in this chapter, the Spirit thus recognised, we have "the book of the wars of the Lord" -- a remarkable book.<a name=218:20></a> One would not like to shine in any other; one would not like to have one's name

	<div class="paragraph">
		inscribed in any other book of wars save the book of the wars of the Lord.<a name=219:1></a> So that as the Spirit is recognised, then the record is made of the Lord's wars.<a name=219:2></a> They are only Jehovah's wars as they are carried on under the direction of Christ, for He is the "captain of the army of Jehovah".<a name=219:3></a> <a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#5:14">Joshua  5:14</a>.<a name=219:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing comes out in this chapter which is worthy of note, and that is the saying of the poets.<a name=219:5></a> While the Spirit is thus recognised collectively you have the book of the wars of the Lord and the saying of the poets.<a name=219:6></a> We may thank God for the spiritual poetry that we possess: it is not to be despised, but it should never replace the poet; the poetry should never replace the spirit of the poet amongst us.<a name=219:7></a> The Psalmist says, "I speak of the things which I have made touching the king".<a name=219:8></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#45:1">Psalm  45:1</a>.<a name=219:9></a> That is what is to be preserved -- it is what the poets <i>say;</i> that is, those who speak to God feelingly.<a name=219:10></a> There are "psalms and hymns and spiritual songs".<a name=219:11></a> <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:19">Ephesians  5:19</a>.<a name=219:12></a> These all fit in with the recognition of the Spirit.<a name=219:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, now I want to show how the goat character comes into evidence in chapter 23, for it is seen not only in individuals, but in companies.<a name=219:14></a> Israel, he says, "shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations".<a name=219:15></a> We know how, as young nations develop, they greatly seek to be reckoned as one of the nations, to be on an equality with the nations.<a name=219:16></a> That is natural to us all.<a name=219:17></a> We know how Israel, alas, when declining, sought to have a king like the nations.<a name=219:18></a>

		In reading these scriptures, I wish to speak about divine provision; that is, God's provision for His people, to the end that we might be, as it says here, "satisfied" spiritually, and, as satisfied, available to Him.<a name=225:1></a> The psalm is a very remarkable one, even from the standpoint of the physical creation as we have it, for it brings out the wonderful bountifulness of God.<a name=225:2></a> It begins, as you will observe, with blessing by the psalmist.<a name=225:3></a> He says, "Bless the Lord, O my soul.<a name=225:4></a> O Lord my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty".<a name=225:5></a> In saying this the inspired psalmist is about to cover the salient features of the physical creation as we have it, and no one who knows God can fail to be affected as he soberly takes account of the physical creation.<a name=225:6></a> The apostle Paul also witnesses to this; he says, "The invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#1:20">Romans  1:20</a>.<a name=225:7></a>

		No one who looks into the heavens calmly and soberly, as knowing God, can fail to be affected as the psalmist.<a name=225:8></a> And as we survey the earth, teeming as it is with divine bountifulness, in its fruit, as watered by the rain of heaven and covered with ornamentation, which was divinely intended to meet man's eye as God created him, no one can fail to be similarly affected.<a name=225:9></a> For you will recall how that in planting the garden (God Himself did that, "eastward in Eden" ) , He "made to grow out of the ground every tree that is pleasant to the sight".<a name=225:10></a> <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:8">Genesis  2:8</a>,9.<a name=225:11></a> That is not to be overlooked, it is mentioned before trees yielding food: so that God intended man to be surrounded

		Now, having arrived at this verse, my thought is not to occupy you with what is material or physical, but with what is spiritual.<a name=226:13></a> My thought is to show that God brought in the means of satisfaction from "His upper chambers".<a name=226:14></a> At the outset of creation it would appear that the earth was self-sustaining.<a name=226:15></a> When moisture was necessary, "A mist", we are told, "arose from the earth".<a name=226:16></a> <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:6">Genesis  2:6</a>.<a name=226:17></a> There is nothing said about water coming down.<a name=226:18></a> The first mention of water coming down is that the windows of heaven were opened in order to let out the waters of the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He is not content to generalise man with the cattle, although man in one sense stands in relation to the animal creation; but he has a unique place with God, and so He returns to man in the next verse and says, "Wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine".<a name=228:14></a> God never intended the cattle to have wine, nor to be anointed with oil.<a name=228:15></a> Man is taken up from the level of the cattle in that he is specially cared for, first by wine to make his heart glad, and secondly by oil to make his face to shine.<a name=228:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=236:1></a> I have been thinking of a passage in Matthew 26, verses 17 to 30.<a name=236:2></a> I had in mind that we should get the bearing of verse 30: "Having sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives", because it seems as if this verse is the outlet from our position here in the testimony connected with the dispensation of God to what is eternal, that outlet being in the Spirit.<a name=236:3></a> This is found in this gospel and in Mark's gospel only, meaning, I apprehend, that these gospels being specially dispensational, there is an outlet even from what is dispensational to what is eternal.<a name=236:4></a> John would lead us directly, from the very outset of his account of the resurrection, into what is eternal, because he begins with the first day of the week.<a name=236:5></a> Matthew connects the resurrection with the sabbath.<a name=236:6></a> The sabbath is in view; meaning, I suppose, that the assembly is connected with the testimony of God, corresponding with Israel's place on earth, taking up all the threads of the testimony; whereas John would lead us outside of all that to what is eternal.<a name=236:7></a> And so I apprehend that Matthew and Mark, while dealing with what is dispensational, give this outlet also.<a name=236:8></a>

		J.T.<a name=251:1></a> I have on my mind that we might pursue the subject of administration, connecting it with the glory of the Lord as in 2 Corinthians 3.<a name=251:2></a> It occurred to me that what I have suggested would link on with what has gone before.<a name=251:3></a> We might be able to compare the glory of the Lord with the glory of the Son of God -- the former having reference to the public or official position of the assembly here, and the latter having to do with the family which links on with eternity.<a name=251:4></a> These are two thoughts that are obviously of immense importance, and, although very intimately co-related, they are, I think, distinct.<a name=251:5></a> They bear on each other during the period of testimony, but the official part will cease; the Son hands over the kingdom to the Father.<a name=251:6></a> The position of the Lord as administering what is of God officially is in Acts 2, and then it is worked out, as one may say, doctrinally, in Romans 5, which chapter is entirely taken up with what comes to us through "our Lord Jesus Christ", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:1">Romans  5:1</a> as the statement is; but this chapter is the continuance of that line, only that it is confined to the covenant.<a name=251:7></a> The covenant, coming in on the line of administration, and being that which refers to God's love for us, represents what we may call the higher part or feature of the Lord's administrative service, so that the spirit of the covenant is said to be the Lord -- "the Lord is that Spirit".<a name=251:8></a> It does not say, 'the Spirit is the Son of God', or 'the Spirit is Christ', or 'the Spirit is Jesus', but it is "the Lord is that Spirit".<a name=251:9></a> It is because the apostle is emphasising the administrative side in which he himself had part subordinately to Christ;

		J. T.<a name=265:1></a> The suggestion was made this morning that we might at this time have before us the glory of the Son of God as compared with the glory of the Lord.<a name=265:2></a> Perhaps we may look at a few passages in chapters 11, 12 and 20 of the gospel of John.<a name=265:3></a> It was remarked at our reading this morning that the glory of the Lord, which we behold, and by which we are to be changed from glory to glory as by the Lord the Spirit, had reference to the ministration of the new covenant; that is, that He, being the Mediator of it, has made it effective.<a name=265:4></a> His blood is the blood of the new covenant; meaning that His death is witness to us of the love of God, and then He makes that love effective in us by the Spirit, the Spirit being shed abroad in our hearts "by the Holy Spirit which has been given to us" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:5">Romans  5:5</a>), so that we are qualified for the assembly of God; qualified to have part in it, being in liberty, and the love shines out in us: "The shining forth of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ".<a name=265:5></a> <a href="../bible/@2Corinthians.htm#4:6">@2 Corinthians  4:6</a>.<a name=265:6></a> We have thus a part according to God in the public witness to Him here.<a name=265:7></a> I thought that the glory of the Son of God, as introducing a collateral line, leads us to the <i>family</i> of God.<a name=265:8></a> He brings us in and qualifies us to have part in the family of God.<a name=265:9></a> The place we thus receive, and the relationship we thus obtain with Christ, remain, and run on into eternity.<a name=265:10></a> So that it is perhaps the greatest thing that we are sons of God.<a name=265:11></a> It occurred to me that these passages would furnish material for these thoughts, in that the Lord Himself says, "This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish to speak this evening about the overcomer.<a name=279:1></a> The Lord spoke of Himself in this term; and so, as in all else, He affords us a lead.<a name=279:2></a> We learn from Christ how to overcome.<a name=279:3></a> Having set out the thought, He introduced it in all the addresses in Revelation 2 and 3, so that it has special reference to times of departure from divine ways and principles.<a name=279:4></a> It has special reference therefore to our times.<a name=279:5></a> The peculiar reward in each letter to the assemblies is for the overcomer; and then, what I wanted to enlarge on is that the overcomer becomes a link by which the Lord intervenes for recovery in any given phase of the Church's lamentable history.<a name=279:6></a> The overcomer is the link which the Lord recognises, and through which He intervenes for general recovery.<a name=279:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I read from John 14, because the passage refers to the time of departure, when the commandments of the Lord were being generally disregarded, and when His word was not kept; when His words or sayings were neglected.<a name=279:8></a> Under these circumstances the overcomer is of special interest to Him.<a name=279:9></a> He is, in a word, "the disciple whom Jesus loved"; for John is but a type in this respect; and his wonderful effectiveness in recovery is set before us to encourage us to be overcomers.<a name=279:10></a> He was the disciple whom Jesus loved, and I have not a doubt that throughout the whole history, distressing as it is disgraceful and dishonourable in every aspect, there has been in all the phases of the departure a disciple whom Jesus loved.<a name=279:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, as we come down to our own circumstances, when failure happens (as, alas!<a name=279:12></a> it does, even with

	<div class="paragraph">
		those who have the light of Christ and the assembly) an overcomer is the link, whether it be in a small locality, or district, or country.<a name=280:1></a> And the overcomer -- however unostentatious he may be, however passive -- loves the Lord, and holds himself aloof from those who disregard his commandments.<a name=280:2></a> He might have to suffer with them, like Caleb and Joshua of old, who adhered to the light, and yet traversed the wilderness with the people of God who were caused to traverse it for forty years instead of eleven days because of their self-will.<a name=280:3></a> He is willing to do that.<a name=280:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We hear of no complaint from either Caleb or Joshua that they had to suffer, not for their own self-will, but for the self-will of their brethren; but they shone with divine lustre as they entered into Canaan.<a name=280:5></a> God honoured them; they were before God in their souls.<a name=280:6></a> They were without complaint.<a name=280:7></a> They suffered with their brethren.<a name=280:8></a> Moses had given them a wonderful lead; he elected to suffer affliction with the people of God.<a name=280:9></a> Whatever their ways, they were the people of God, and he elected to suffer with them.<a name=280:10></a> So these two overcomers suffered for forty years with their brethren; but God honoured them.<a name=280:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So I wish to elicit from the scriptures in Genesis the confirmation of what I have said, for Joseph, being a type of Christ, gives us a lead.<a name=280:12></a> A great principle in God's ways is to give a lead, and in Christ He has One who sets out every thought He intended to be developed in His people.<a name=280:13></a> Every thought that God intended to be developed in His people is set out in Christ; and in Joseph we have a type of Christ, as overcoming.<a name=280:14></a> In Benjamin we have a type of the believer who, having such a lead, overcame.<a name=280:15></a> Benjamin is the overcomer in this remarkable prophetic outline of Christ and His brethren.<a name=280:16></a>

		Chapter 48 is one of the finest sections of scripture; Jacob is sick and about to die; and when he hears that Joseph is coming to him, he strengthens himself, indicating the inherent power in his soul.<a name=303:7></a> Having strengthened himself, he blesses according to God.<a name=303:8></a> It is God's right to bless, but it is also a privilege of those who represent Him, to bless also.<a name=303:9></a> You can see how great and how weighty a matter this representation is; but God intends, I believe, at the end of the dispensation in which we are, to have this representation of Himself; He places it within the reach of every believer; so that unless I have arrived at the state of soul in which I am qualified to represent God, I am short of His thought for me.<a name=303:10></a>

		I have before me to speak about parentage, and to show that the effect of it, as presented in Christ, is seen in the ornamentation of the house of God.<a name=359:1></a> The idea of ornamentation, as most of us know, has a great place in Scripture, and in no connection is it more interesting than in the divine family.<a name=359:2></a> We know, from observation, that the physical creation is wonderfully ornamented.<a name=359:3></a> This is also verified by Scripture; for it is said that God garnished the heavens, by His Spirit; <a href="../bible/Job.htm#26:13">Job  26:13</a>.<a name=359:4></a> They not only serve men on the earth by way of light, rule and guidance, but are wonderfully ornamented.<a name=359:5></a> The earth too is ornamented with all that which is pleasing to the eye of man, as created by God, who, at the beginning of man's history, provided a spot for him in Eden; in which there were all manner of trees planted by His hand.<a name=359:6></a> It is not simply that the earth was to "bring forth", as in chapter 1 of Genesis, but the Lord God <i>planted</i> the garden eastward in Eden; and then the four-headed river flowing out of Eden to water the garden, suggests the same idea of ornamentation.<a name=359:7></a>
