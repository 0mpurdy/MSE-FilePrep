		What is in mind in reading these scriptures is to speak about <i>personality</i>, which is one feature of the Scriptures: certain persons calling attention to themselves as speaking -- "I Jesus", "Paul the aged", "I John", "I Daniel".<a name=1:2></a> The first scripture, one well known to us, is Jesus addressing Himself to the assemblies; He calls attention to Himself, not simply as known under that precious appellation of "Jesus", but He introduces His history -- a matter of importance in those who have part in the service, in the testimony of God.<a name=1:3></a> Who is He?<a name=1:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Great personages have come up, are coming up, and will come up, in the course of this world, with little or no history, the most distinguished of all comes up out of the sea.<a name=1:5></a> We cannot obtain histories from the depths of the sea.<a name=1:6></a> We have not far to go for illustrations of persons coming into great prominence without any history behind them to qualify them.<a name=1:7></a> In the testimony of God, personality is given great prominence, and what precedes it, what enters into it, in the way of history.<a name=1:8></a> So that the Lord leads in this respect, especially in the verses read in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22">Revelation  22</a>.<a name=1:9></a> "<i>I</i> Jesus have sent mine angel to testify these things to you in the assemblies".<a name=1:10></a> He leaves out John; John has his own personality, which we hope to look at.<a name=1:11></a> He mentions an angel, one of those of whose histories we know little, not that they have no histories, but very little is disclosed to us as to them in this respect; the stress therefore as to personality, in the Lord's remarks here, is on Himself.<a name=1:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the beginning of this book we have "Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to shew to his bondmen what must shortly take place; and he signified it, sending by his angel, to his bondman John".<a name=2:1></a> John comes in mediately between the angel and the assembly, but he is assumed in the Lord's remarks in the verses read to have a personality of his own, which the Lord by the Spirit would throw into evidence; one of the most interesting personalities in the Scripture is that of John.<a name=2:2></a> The angels are not presented to us as objects of attraction, they are all ministering servants sent out to minister on account of those -- namely, ourselves, that is, christians -- who are heirs of salvation.<a name=2:3></a> But the bondmen of Jesus have personalities, histories behind them, and peculiarly so John.<a name=2:4></a> The Lord could say constantly, directly and indirectly, that John is the one I peculiarly love; it is well worth while, therefore, to look into his history.<a name=2:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Jesus says further, "<i>I</i> am the root and offspring of David" -- no other history like that.<a name=2:6></a> John gives us even more than that, he begins his narrative of Jesus with, "In the beginning was the Word", alluding to the greatest expression morally of ability in man, the power of the mind, and that He was the Word itself personified -- the mind of God was there.<a name=2:7></a> That is how the beloved disciple begins in speaking about Jesus -- "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God .<a name=2:8></a>.<a name=2:9></a>.<a name=2:10></a> All things received being through him, and without him not one thing received being which has received being" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:1">John  1:1</a>,3).<a name=2:11></a> Of no being could that be predicated but One, not even the Father.<a name=2:12></a> The Son has distinction peculiar to Himself.<a name=2:13></a> The Father judges no one, but has committed all judgment to the Son.<a name=2:14></a> It is not said that the Father made all things -- the Son made all things.<a name=2:15></a> So that the Son has His own distinctiveness; personality is supreme there.<a name=2:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now here He is speaking to the assembly, the peculiar formation under Paul's ministry, for, without naming him, the apostle Paul comes into this book in his work in the word "assemblies".<a name=3:1></a> John wrote to Paul's assemblies, we might say, and the Lord Jesus is speaking to them now -- "I Jesus", He says, and, as using that form, He intends to impress us with personality, and personality as bearing on the present time as well as on the past and future.<a name=3:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That there is personality in the sense in which I am speaking of it, is unquestionable; there is not a single saint that has not a personality; the least esteemed in the assembly is equal to being put on the judge's seat (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#6:4">1 Corinthians  6:4</a>), and that involves personality.<a name=3:3></a> So that the idea ought to come home to every one of us, and the Lord Jesus in putting Himself forward to the assemblies impresses us with this great thought of personality.<a name=3:4></a> It is doubtful if we would have much ministry save as <i>someone</i> understands what is said.<a name=3:5></a> I mean it has, otherwise, no resting-place.<a name=3:6></a> It is said of Samuel's words that none of them fell to the ground.<a name=3:7></a> It is rare that this could be said of anyone -- none of them fell to the ground, not one of his words.<a name=3:8></a> That would mean that they fell into honest and good hearts, and that helps to give pungency and reaction to ministry.<a name=3:9></a> We must look for reaction.<a name=3:10></a> 'A fine word', we say, but what about the practical effect?<a name=3:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Fruit for God requires intelligence, that is to say, "good ground" is the ground of the person who understands the word.<a name=3:12></a> He might not be able to give an address, as we say, on the words he heard, but still, there is the element of understanding, and that is not in man naturally -- that is the work of God, the good ground is the fruit of the work of God.<a name=3:13></a> So that the Lord, in speaking to the assemblies, spoke to those who had understanding; they were poorly instructed, no doubt, considering the period contemplated, but He speaks to them here as worthy of being spoken to.<a name=3:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is no question here of reproach, He is speaking to the assemblies according to their dignity -- "<i>I</i> Jesus have sent mine angel to testify these things to you in the assemblies", without saying anything about John, as if the assemblies themselves could take in the testimony.<a name=4:1></a> That is another thing to be noted in this book, the word "testify".<a name=4:2></a> It belongs peculiarly to times in which things are doubted, times in which the enemy's effort is to make divine things uncertain, and to make the truth of God a lie.<a name=4:3></a> So this word is of immense importance, and it is very prevalent throughout this book; John "testified the word of God, and the testimony of Jesus Christ, all things that he saw"; he is a perfect witness.<a name=4:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the Lord is implying that the assemblies understand.<a name=4:5></a> What do they understand?<a name=4:6></a> Well, "I am the root .<a name=4:7></a>.<a name=4:8></a>.<a name=4:9></a> of David", he who stands for all that is best, as we might say, in the service of God, Christ is his root, and his offspring, too.<a name=4:10></a> The "root" is inscrutable, who can get down to discover the meaning in detail of that word, in a divine Person?<a name=4:11></a> "Offspring" is historical.<a name=4:12></a> So that we have the deity of our Lord Jesus presented to us here, in unmistakable terms, and His humanity at the same time -- the Root and Offspring of David.<a name=4:13></a> What a Personality!<a name=4:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As the Lord's word here was read in the assemblies, the thought of personality would arise in their minds.<a name=4:15></a> What have we here in Ephesus?<a name=4:16></a> What have you in Smyrna?<a name=4:17></a> What reaction is there in those leading persons in your meeting from the knowledge that their names are written in heaven?<a name=4:18></a> What correspondence is there?<a name=4:19></a> There must be a correspondence, if things are right, between what we are in heaven and what we are down here.<a name=4:20></a> The Lord might even suggest -- but He does not here -- Why is it that you at Ephesus have turned away from Paul?<a name=4:21></a> Paul says, "all who are in Asia" -- think of that, even before the apostle's death -- "have turned away from me" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1:15">2 Timothy  1:15</a>).<a name=4:22></a> There is no change in heaven's
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		attitude towards Paul; why this change in Asia?<a name=5:1></a> Paul says to the Galatians, "I bear you witness that, if possible, plucking out your own eyes ye would have given them to me" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:15">Galatians  4:15</a>).<a name=5:2></a> Why the change?<a name=5:3></a> The change is not in me, he says, the change is in you.<a name=5:4></a> So it is with us; we are tested by our view, our estimate, of those whom heaven respects and loves.<a name=5:5></a> You do not want to be out of accord with heaven as to any brother.<a name=5:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord in speaking of personality, is bringing Himself to their attention, "I Jesus".<a name=5:7></a> The idea of His personality should permeate all these assemblies; but some in them had turned away from Paul, having left their first love.<a name=5:8></a> Why did they leave their first love?<a name=5:9></a> They lost admiration of Jesus -- that is why; their eyes became blurred, their affections became dull, He was not to them what He used to be.<a name=5:10></a> But He says, I am the same, there is not a whit of change in Me, the change is in you.<a name=5:11></a> "The root and the offspring of David" -- think of who it is, towards whom you are growing cold: it is towards <i>Me</i>.<a name=5:12></a> How commonly it occurs, alas, amongst us!<a name=5:13></a> Our love for Christ grows cold, and we show it by turning away from, or otherwise ill-treating, one of His servants.<a name=5:14></a> There is no change in Me, the Lord says; I am still thinking of you; "<i>I</i> .<a name=5:15></a>.<a name=5:16></a>.<a name=5:17></a> have sent mine angel to testify these things to you in the assemblies.<a name=5:18></a> <i>I</i> am the root and offspring of David, the bright and morning star".<a name=5:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I now go on to Paul.<a name=5:20></a> What I have said is to generalise my subject, showing that there is perfection in Jesus, and as presented in Him the idea of personality is to permeate all the assemblies; every one of, them.<a name=5:21></a> And the idea of the personality of Jesus comes right down to us, for the whole history is in mind.<a name=5:22></a> At the end there is a change in the assemblies, for there is such an one as is designated the bride, the supreme feminine idea of personality -- of the glory of affection.<a name=5:23></a> The Lord is ending on that, and He is succeeding, too,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=6>[Page 6]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		thank God, in however few; "the Spirit and the bride", as if there were a revival at the end, a response to this great personality which has come right down to us: Jesus.<a name=6:1></a> This book is full of it, and the Spirit has at least some who can be designated as the bride, and surely, dear brethren, every one of us wishes from the bottom of his heart, with all his heart and strength, to be among those who are designated as "the bride"!<a name=6:2></a> Personality -- feminine personality -- is there supremely, as it is in Jesus as Man supremely, for there is perfect correspondence between the Bridegroom and the bride.<a name=6:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Coming to Paul, I want to show how his personality enters into the preservation of the work of God, the preservation and the full valuation of every item of the work of God; this in truth is how the bride is reached.<a name=6:4></a> Onesimus is the theme of the letter to Philemon, a slave, but "a brother beloved" already; and there are many such, but they have not really, in the minds of many, been given their proper valuation.<a name=6:5></a> I am sure of that; money and status and what not, becloud our vision, so that brethren do not acquire their proper valuation.<a name=6:6></a> Philemon, apparently, was in danger of being beclouded by these things, he was the master of this slave.<a name=6:7></a> As such in earlier days, can he now look at him according to his real value?<a name=6:8></a> Gold is gold, wherever it is -- gold is always gold.<a name=6:9></a> Here is someone sent to Colosse apparently, a nugget, one might say, more than that, a precious stone, one who is to shine presently, and already is shining.<a name=6:10></a> Will he shine for Philemon?<a name=6:11></a> Will he adorn the house of Philemon -- will he adorn the assembly that is in Philemon's house?<a name=6:12></a> Will he be just a servant, just a slave, just that and nothing more when the brethren are invited into the house of Philemon?<a name=6:13></a> These are pertinent questions.<a name=6:14></a> Our eyes are readily blurred to the real value of the subjects of the work of God.<a name=6:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=7>[Page 7]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle says, "I rather exhort, being such a one as Paul the aged" -- a man of experience.<a name=7:1></a> If you were to ask Philemon, What do you think of Paul?<a name=7:2></a> Ah, he would say, there is no one like him, he has a big credit with me.<a name=7:3></a> Paul says, Take from that credit and put it to the credit of Onesimus -- that is, equalise things.<a name=7:4></a> Maybe I think too much of Paul and too little of Onesimus.<a name=7:5></a> Why Onesimus?<a name=7:6></a> Well, Onesimus is my child, he says; but if there is any indebtedness involved in this, well, debit it to my account.<a name=7:7></a> "I Paul" say it; not "Paul the aged" now, Paul the <i>man of means</i> now, the man who has a credit.<a name=7:8></a> Philemon would not deny it, he would say readily, I am sure, There is not a man I value more than Paul.<a name=7:9></a> I believe he would say that at this time.<a name=7:10></a> The apostle assumes that, but what he is concerned about is this young man who had been in a very menial position in that household.<a name=7:11></a> There was an assembly in the house, too -- it is worth while mentioning that, for the assembly of course normally is not concerned as to whether a man is a slave or a master, the principle in this respect governing the assembly is that the rich glory in their humiliation.<a name=7:12></a> The presence of an assembly in one's house ought to help me to rightly value a brother, although poor in this world's goods.<a name=7:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is an important matter, if any one has personality amongst us to use it to its fullest extent to promote the right valuation of the work of God.<a name=7:14></a> We are greatly hampered if the work of God is not rightly valued.<a name=7:15></a> I do not say poverty in itself has any virtue; I do not think it has, though it may be so regarded by some.<a name=7:16></a> It is a question of the equalisation of things -- "let the brother of low degree glory in his elevation, and the rich in his humiliation" (<a href="../bible/James.htm#1:9">James  1:9</a>,10).<a name=7:17></a> Not that the brother of low degree is brought into better circumstances after the flesh, not at all -- he is brought in where the work of God is rightly valued, and that is in the assembly.<a name=7:18></a> So that personality, according to
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=8>[Page 8]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		what I am saying, is for the preservation of right values of the work of God amongst the people of God.<a name=8:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are other connections in which Paul's personality is implied -- valuable, too -- but I thought I would select this one.<a name=8:2></a> He brings it in in speaking to the Galatians: "I Paul"(chapter 5:2), he puts it into the scale against <i>legality</i> -- another thing that greatly hampers us as brethren.<a name=8:3></a> It is the Jewish element; legality is, I believe, put in that way in Scripture, and any personality that we have according to God may be rightly put into the scale against it to show that legality is not of any value at all.<a name=8:4></a> It is worse than useless; the apostle says, "I, Paul, say to you, that if ye are circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing".<a name=8:5></a> Think of that!<a name=8:6></a> You are deprived, he says, of all benefit from the Christ if you are circumcised, that is, going back to judaism, the beggarly elements whereby christians were being put into bondage; and the apostle puts the whole force of his personality into the scale against that.<a name=8:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing he puts it against is rivalry amongst the brethren, indeed, it was a question of rivalry against himself.<a name=8:8></a> In <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#10:1">2 Corinthians  10:1</a> he throws his personality into the scale against that and he says, "I myself, Paul, entreat you by the meekness and gentleness of the Christ .<a name=8:9></a>.<a name=8:10></a>.<a name=8:11></a>.<a name=8:12></a>" Can we doubt that what he meant was that his personality carried with it those glorious traits and features, the meekness and gentleness of Christ?<a name=8:13></a> He throws that weight into the scale, in the chapter, against rivalry against himself, because they were comparing themselves with themselves in Corinth.<a name=8:14></a> A school of pride and competition had risen up in that assembly shortly after he left to labour elsewhere.<a name=8:15></a> He says, I want to show you the lightness and unprofitableness, to say nothing of the wickedness, of it.<a name=8:16></a> "I Paul"; he brings himself forward, and he beseeches them by the meekness and gentleness of Christ.<a name=8:17></a> He cites one brother at Corinth making a remark about him, saying, that his letters are weighty.<a name=8:18></a> I quite admit
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=9>[Page 9]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that -- this man would say to one of his party maybe -- but his bodily presence is weak.<a name=9:1></a> What a wretched thing to say about a brother!<a name=9:2></a> And as regards his speech, he said, it is contemptible.<a name=9:3></a> The apostle had that sort of thing in mind.<a name=9:4></a> What he wrote is now for us.<a name=9:5></a> That chapter is for us, to expose the baneful element of rivalry, of competition, in the things of God; "measuring themselves by themselves" (chapter 10:12) even.<a name=9:6></a> In the next chapter he says, I am compelled to go over my own history because of your attitude, but in chapter 10 he throws in his weight of personality to correct them -- "I myself, Paul, entreat you by the meekness and gentleness of the Christ".<a name=9:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, the next word is in regard to John -- one of the loveliest personalities that Scripture affords.<a name=9:8></a> We do not find his name in his gospel, it is usually "the disciple whom Jesus loved".<a name=9:9></a> Now he is putting his name in; that is to say, it is again a question of weight, of importance; one sacrifices his own personal feelings to help the brethren, even if he has to bring himself in.<a name=9:10></a> "I John".<a name=9:11></a> Well, who is he?<a name=9:12></a> That is the next thing.<a name=9:13></a> "Your brother", he says, "and fellow-partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and patience, in Jesus".<a name=9:14></a> It is evidently a position of power -- <i>in</i> Jesus; but still, tribulation is there too.<a name=9:15></a> Think of the fixedness of things, think of tribulation being as it were fixed in that sense -- it is in Jesus.<a name=9:16></a> The apostle Paul speaks of himself as "the prisoner in the Lord" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:1">Ephesians  4:1</a>) -- it is a position of dignity and power.<a name=9:17></a> So that the beloved disciple is now introducing himself, in what he has to say.<a name=9:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This book is full of signs and symbols, all of which have to be shown.<a name=9:19></a> It is a principle in the book that things are shown, but before we enter upon it we have this great personality brought to our attention -- "I John, your brother and fellow-partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and patience, in Jesus".<a name=9:20></a> The saints are well off to have that brother, such a personality.<a name=9:21></a> If there are brothers like him in any degree today, it is
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=10>[Page 10]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		well to keep them in mind, because we are enriched by them.<a name=10:1></a> John, of course, is outstanding in the whole history of the testimony, but still, as I said, these scriptures are written for us, not simply to interest us in John, but also in any one like him today.<a name=10:2></a> It is a question of what we have, and not only so, but that each of us should seek to be like John.<a name=10:3></a> Why not be like John?<a name=10:4></a> Why not be a brother like this -- a companion in tribulation with the brethren?<a name=10:5></a> But it is "in the tribulation and kingdom and patience, in Jesus"; we are bound up in that position, but then there is this personality with it.<a name=10:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then he says, I "was in the island called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus.<a name=10:7></a> I became in the Spirit on the Lord's day" -- that is, he gives us a good lead for our assembly services, he is a man able to instruct us, although a sufferer, and a prisoner, in Patmos, evidently without any brethren with him, for the testimony of Jesus.<a name=10:8></a> He is also able to abstract himself entirely, he is in the Spirit on the Lord's day -- not the first day of the week here.<a name=10:9></a> This is the only place where we get "the Lord's day" mentioned formally, but it is entirely in accord with the circumstances.<a name=10:10></a> The first day of the week is a question of privilege, of enjoying privilege and looking into eternity, whereas the Lord's day has to do with the opposition, with the power of Satan in this world.<a name=10:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here on the Lord's day, John could abstract himself and be in the Spirit, and that means much, it means that he had part in a wholly spiritual order of things.<a name=10:12></a> The fact that he was in prison did not hinder him at all, he was outside of it in the Spirit.<a name=10:13></a> So he is ready to hear a divine trumpet; he says, "I became in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet .<a name=10:14></a>.<a name=10:15></a>.<a name=10:16></a>.<a name=10:17></a>" That is another thing, an example for us, because there are such voices -- many do not hear them, and it is to our great detriment if we do not.<a name=10:18></a> So that the personality here before us
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=11>[Page 11]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		is for us to emulate and follow, to have an ear to hear, as he says over and over again.<a name=11:1></a> Here it is a voice like a trumpet, so that anyone who does not hear is deaf.<a name=11:2></a> John was not deaf; he heard a voice behind him, as if to call him back to seen things, to sorrows, to conflicts, to desolations unspeakable, as one might say, but he is ready for it.<a name=11:3></a> He turned back to see the voice, for it was a question of the voice; the voice carries personality with it.<a name=11:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		John has a personality of his own, but he understands the personality of Jesus more perhaps than any; but it was a "voice" -- he turned to see the voice, and he saw something in Jesus he had not seen before, namely, judicial habiliments, judicial appearance, judicial glory.<a name=11:5></a> I cannot stop to speak of that, but one of the glories of Christ is His judicial glory; it enters into our care meetings and many other such services we have to do towards one another.<a name=11:6></a> Let us not think that it is anything less than the glory.<a name=11:7></a> But I am speaking now of his personality, and what an example we have in John, according to his words which I have quoted.<a name=11:8></a> Let this personality come into our souls, because we may have to face prisons; if we do not face them now, some of our brethren do.<a name=11:9></a> "The same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#5:9">1 Peter  5:9</a>).<a name=11:10></a> Surely it is for us to be like John, to be to the saints, "your brother and fellow-partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and patience, in Jesus".<a name=11:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Finally, I will just say a few words about Daniel.<a name=11:12></a> His personality is brought in perhaps as much as any -- "I Daniel" is mentioned several times.<a name=11:13></a> He is a servant of God who has a unique place, his ministry is largely among the gentiles, to give us light about the gentile monarchies -- a very important matter.<a name=11:14></a> If we run through the book, with what I am speaking of in mind, we shall be impressed with the personality of Daniel from the beginning to the end.<a name=11:15></a> He is a most attractive man spiritually, and it is a great advantage to have a

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He says, "I Daniel understood by the books that the number of the years, whereof the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah the prophet, for the accomplishment of the desolations of Jerusalem, was seventy years".<a name=13:7></a> That is the first thing to notice here; he was a man who read his Bible and read it for a purpose.<a name=13:8></a> He read the prophet Jeremiah and he learnt from Jeremiah that seventy years were to be accomplished in the desolations of Jerusalem, and he began to pray according to that.<a name=13:9></a> That is, we must have some basis for our prayers; we are often merely theoretic as to prayers.<a name=13:10></a> If I pray for anything, I must have some reason for asking God for that thing, and Daniel acted according to this, as I have shown.<a name=13:11></a> The seventy years were nearly over and so he prays.<a name=13:12></a> I cannot go over the chapter; most of you perhaps are conversant with the book of Daniel.<a name=13:13></a> This chapter is very striking; he had in mind that he should find out something about Jerusalem, and, clothed in sackcloth, he prayed and

		So he goes on with his prayer, and a great minister comes to tell him that from the time he began to pray heaven was moved; he says, "O Daniel, man greatly beloved .<a name=14:4></a>.<a name=14:5></a>.<a name=14:6></a> unto thee am I now sent" (chapter 10:11).<a name=14:7></a> What a personality he had in the mind of heaven!<a name=14:8></a> The book shows he also had a great personality even among kings.<a name=14:9></a> Able, on the one hand, to respect the <i>authorities</i>, however wicked the persons might be; and, on the other hand, to maintain the rights of God.<a name=14:10></a> There is no greater lesson than this at the present moment, to learn how to maintain the rights of God, and yet to respect every bit of gold, everything that is of God in this world.<a name=14:11></a> For gold is gold, and God would have us put names on things and value them aright, and with all that to say, "God must be obeyed rather than men" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#5:29">Acts  5:29</a>).<a name=14:12></a> So if Daniel has to pray towards Jerusalem, he does it knowing full well the possible penalty.<a name=14:13></a> He did it, he suffered, but he respected the authority.<a name=14:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Think of the king coming to a man like this, to the mouth of the lion's den, and saying, "O Daniel" -- what a feeling the man had!<a name=14:15></a> And what a personality Daniel had!<a name=14:16></a> God gave him that, and He would give me that, or any one of us, in measure; for we need it in having to do with the authorities, so as not to incur unnecessary displeasure, but to be balanced in regard of them.<a name=14:17></a> So Gabriel tells him how he is loved in heaven, and he says, I am going to tell you the whole story of all you want to know about dates, about your people, and your city; not only the seventy years that are past, but he says, "Seventy weeks are apportioned out upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to close the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make expiation for iniquity" (chapter 9:24).<a name=14:18></a> All this,

	<div class="paragraph">
		dear brethren, is to sustain us; there is going to be an end of these things, God has fixed His day, and not a minute beyond that will it go -- He will bring in everlasting righteousness.<a name=15:1></a> It is for Daniel's people and Daniel's city; but soon to be the city of Christ, the city of the great King and His people.<a name=15:2></a> He will bring in everlasting righteousness, for in truth Jesus does it; He takes away the sin of the world; He does this and also baptises with the Holy Spirit.<a name=15:3></a> He effects the whole purpose of God.<a name=15:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So you can see, dear brethren, how personality enters into all this, and, in a word, it is what any man or woman is, not simply what I am able to say in ministry or what I know, but what I <i>am</i>, and it has its own effect; God intends there should be personality as I have been speaking of it at the present time.<a name=15:5></a> It is a question of <i>quality</i>.<a name=15:6></a> What the prophet said applies today: the good figs are very good and the bad ones are very bad (<a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#24:1">Jeremiah  24:1</a> - 3).<a name=15:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Matthew clearly has personality in mind, because he begins with the Son of man coming in <i>His</i> kingdom: "Verily, I say unto you", the Lord says, "There are some of those standing here that shall not taste of death at all until they shall have seen the Son of man coming in his kingdom".<a name=16:6></a> The idea is, the Person of the Lord Jesus, in this title, but coming in His kingdom; it will be displayed -- involving a great personal distinction.<a name=16:7></a> So we have, as distinctive to Matthew, His countenance as the sun, and the bright cloud, and the voice saying, "<i>This</i> is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight" (chapter 17:5).<a name=16:8></a> We may look at Matthew first, having the features in mind to which attention has been called.<a name=16:9></a> Does this outline of the three accounts strike you as right?<a name=16:10></a>

		J.T.<a name=17:1></a> Yes.<a name=17:2></a> The remaining part of <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#17">Matthew  17</a>seems to emphasise and enlarge on the thought, for it introduces sonship, bringing the disciples into association with Christ, as He says to Peter: "Then are the sons free"; He associates Peter with Himself in connection with the piece of money; saying, "take that and give it to them for me and thee".<a name=17:3></a> It elevates us in our thoughts and affections, too, as we humbly and yet really accept this dignity that the Lord puts upon us, especially in assembly service.<a name=17:4></a>

		J.T.<a name=17:9></a> Yes; the revelation to Peter in chapter 16 precedes this.<a name=17:10></a> There the Lord includes Peter in the same sort of dignity that attaches to himself as the Foundation -- that is, in the sense of <i>material</i>, "Peter", as no doubt all understand, being "stone" -- part of the rock.<a name=17:11></a> So that the personal dignity afforded in the revelation enters into the assembly viewed as a <i>structure</i>.<a name=17:12></a> It is however more than a structure, it is a vessel of service, and it is as in this relation that we have the idea of personality in the end of chapter 17 -- sonship, required both for service Godward and manward.<a name=17:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=17:17></a> I think so.<a name=17:18></a> Matthew brings out the idea of personality -- obviously not what we are in any way after the flesh, but what we are according to divine counsel and work, divine counsel as to us, and divine work in us, and the education that goes with it.<a name=17:19></a> Hence we have the <i>names</i> of the persons here who appeared without saying they were men, and in Mark also; whereas Luke stresses they were men -- "two men" -- their names are secondary.<a name=17:20></a> These are outstanding persons in the Old Testament, and their appearance here is to remind us of the heavenly side of our position -- those who are of the assembly, heavenly personalities.<a name=17:21></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=18:5></a> You mean that it was a natural trait working out in Peter to prevent the Lord from fulfilling the work which He came to accomplish; his assuming to know better than the Lord -- that what the Lord had spoken should not be?<a name=18:6></a> That certainly is not a trait of heavenly personality, for the will of God is to be done here as up there.<a name=18:7></a> That will is to be known fully in man, not in angels, although they fulfil the will of God; but we learn the will of God from Man, that is, in Christ, and now, in measure, in those who are of Christ.<a name=18:8></a>

		C.A.<a name=22:9></a>C.<a name=22:10></a> You have made it clear to us that heavenly status is "a man in Christ", but in a moral sense, men who can call attention to themselves are of importance, because they are of moral weight and, if thrown into the scale at times, weigh it down in favour of what is right.<a name=22:11></a> It is important to have distinction in that way.<a name=22:12></a> It is important in the testimony, for at times the saints are simply governed by the weight of a man of God like that; if they cannot see principles clearly, they know him.<a name=22:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=22:14></a> So, as you say, we have the idea in John in Patmos, and even in Jesus -- "I Jesus" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:16">Revelation  22:16</a>).<a name=22:15></a> What He is as known thus is in mind.<a name=22:16></a> Daniel is an outstanding man: the Spirit alludes to him in that way in his book frequently.<a name=22:17></a> "Go thy way, Daniel, .<a name=22:18></a>.<a name=22:19></a>.<a name=22:20></a>" the angel says, "thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot" (<a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#12:13">Daniel  12:13</a>).<a name=22:21></a> Ezekiel refers to Daniel as of importance in a moral way.<a name=22:22></a>

		Now, as regards Mark, the idea is, as has often been said, that there are those who are to serve in a levitical way.<a name=23:6></a> In this gospel the Lord goes up into the mountain and calls to Him whom He Himself would, appointing twelve that they might be with Him, that He might send them forth to preach (chapter 3:13,14).<a name=23:7></a> Mark, in giving the account of the transfiguration, quotes the Lord as saying, ".<a name=23:8></a>.<a name=23:9></a>.<a name=23:10></a> the kingdom of God come in power"; and he says, "Jesus takes with him Peter and James and John, and takes them up on a high mountain by themselves apart".<a name=23:11></a> Earlier, Mark says the Lord, having gone up into the mountain, called whom He Himself would, and appointed twelve that they might be with Him, that He might send them forth to preach.<a name=23:12></a> They are viewed as a class; and here these three are taken "by themselves apart".<a name=23:13></a> All this is peculiar to Mark, showing that servants have to learn to be apart with Christ; not as a clerical set, of course, but nevertheless servants of a peculiar kind.<a name=23:14></a> "With him" they learn true personality.<a name=23:15></a> They are not to be rivals, they have the same opportunities, all chosen of Christ, and all with Him so as to come under His influence, and all sent forth to preach: they are commissioned men.<a name=23:16></a> So the end here is, "suddenly having looked around, they no longer saw any one, but Jesus alone with themselves" -- not "and themselves", but "with themselves", a great comfort to those who are in any way commissioned, would you say?<a name=23:17></a>

		Then another thing here is that the Lord having conveyed to Saul that He had something in Damascus, makes him know also that He had those in Damascus who could <i>instruct</i> him.<a name=51:12></a> I may ask in passing, dear brethren, Where is there anyone who will instruct you really as to God, save those who have the Spirit of God, and who recognise the Spirit of God, those who are pious, like Ananias?<a name=51:13></a> You may go to seminaries, colleges, universities, but they will not tell you what to do as subject to the will of God.<a name=51:14></a> They will instruct you as to many things, but they will not tell you what heaven wants you to do.<a name=51:15></a> On the other hand,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here the Lord does not wait for Saul to say, What shall I do?<a name=52:6></a> We get it later, of course, but the point here is not that, but that the Lord is anticipating the fact that he needs to know what to do.<a name=52:7></a> He always anticipates the needs of His people, and Saul's need at this particular time was to know what he should do.<a name=52:8></a> The Lord says, There are people who can tell you; go into Damascus; the Lord inferring thus that there are those that can tell you what to do; and so as to make the matter complete, the Lord goes before him into Damascus.<a name=52:9></a> He can go quicker than any other, there is no locomotion like His: we have an illustration of it in Elijah, who told Ahab that he heard the sound of rain, and that he should go to Samaria, but Elijah girded up his loins and went before him, in spite of his chariot (<a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#18">1 Kings  18</a>); and so the Lord is always before us.<a name=52:10></a> He was before Saul in Damascus, at least He was with Ananias before Saul met him, and he prepared Ananias to do what was needful in order to serve this convert.<a name=52:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the lesson is the Lord coming into the circumstances of a Saul, and stressing the fact of His saints.<a name=52:12></a> If there is one here who thinks he can get along without them, it is a mistake, the Lord indicates that you cannot.<a name=52:13></a> Even when you go up to heaven you will go with them; we are to be all raised up together.<a name=52:14></a> So this convert is with the disciples; the Lord sent Ananias to him,

		and Ananias set him at rest, calling him brother.<a name=53:1></a> It may be there is someone here, lonely in his soul, isolated; you are assuming perhaps that you must go on by yourself, there are none you can go on with.<a name=53:2></a> The Lord would say to you, "go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do".<a name=53:3></a> Not only will those to whom you are sent tell you what to do, but they will love you and make you at home.<a name=53:4></a> One of the finest types in the Old Testament, I think, is the feast of tabernacles; it refers to the households of God's people, the families, where love is, not in an abstract way, as we speak of it sometimes in our addresses and reading meetings, but love <i>shown</i>, that is the idea of the feast of tabernacles.<a name=53:5></a> The Lord said to His disciples, "By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have love amongst yourselves", (<a href="../bible/John.htm#13:35">John  13:35</a>).<a name=53:6></a> The feast of tabernacles recognises that; it is the saints together in outwardly small circumstances near to one another, so that love can have free course; and if there is anyone here at all isolated in his spirit, cold, and thinking, it may be, that nobody loves him, the Lord would say to you, not only that He loves you, but there are those here that love you too -- go into the city, as it were, and you will find them.<a name=53:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I pass on to Matthew, and what you get in this remarkable passage is that the saints are together under the Lord's compelling influence.<a name=53:8></a> If there is anyone here such as I suggested, you would do well to take this to heart, that in this feature of the subject before us there is no option.<a name=53:9></a> To remain isolated is not optional, it is lawlessness; that is another side of the matter, so we are told that the Lord <i>compelled</i> the disciples to go into the ship, they had no option in the matter.<a name=53:10></a> It very often is our salvation to be reminded of authority, for we are prone to think that as regards divine things all is optional, but no, there is nothing optional; all is imperative, even in regard to repentance; God commands it (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#17:30">Acts  17:30</a>), but particularly with

		These verses in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#14">Matthew  14</a>are dispensational, that is, the boat has a meaning in that connection, the Lord not being in it at the outset, but entering it later.<a name=54:2></a> What is in mind here is that the disciples were directed or compelled by the Lord to enter into certain circumstances.<a name=54:3></a> He was praying for them from above, but they are there under His compulsion, and the enemy would like to upset that position, to defeat the divine intent in it.<a name=54:4></a> So the wind was contrary to them, and the sea became agitated.<a name=54:5></a> Applying it now it would be the Lord giving us to understand that our position in relation to the things of God is not optional.<a name=54:6></a> He would have each of us in a certain setting, He would have each to be with the saints, with his brethren.<a name=54:7></a> Why should anyone be isolated?<a name=54:8></a> Well, you may say, the brethren get into trouble, and I do not want to share their troubles.<a name=54:9></a> Well, the sea became agitated, for the wind blew; that is, Satan would upset that position, but then it is educational, this matter of the agitation of the sea, for what are we if we do not experience some little adversity here?<a name=54:10></a> We are not worth being called christians, unless we are ready to face a little opposition, or a big opposition, whatever it may be, good soldiers of Jesus Christ, or good seamen, as it were.<a name=54:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You may think that if you remain in isolation or in some human association you will avoid all this sorrow, but then we want to see how the Lord comes into such circumstances as these, the sorrows and troubles of the saints.<a name=54:12></a> As compelled into a certain position by Him, we <i>must</i> be safe <i>there</i>, no ill can befall us there.<a name=54:13></a> It is education, the Lord would instruct us as to Himself, and He would draw us to His side in these circumstances into which He has come, for in this instance He came into their circumstances -- not at first into the boat, but on the sea near the boat, And now the

		Now, dear brethren, what is meant is that the forsaking of a position in which Christ has placed us must depend on His command.<a name=55:6></a> If I have to move from any given position in which He has placed me; if His instructions require that I am to be in it, then I must await His command before leaving, nothing is optional.<a name=55:7></a> The saint has to learn that every step of the way is to be at His commandment.<a name=55:8></a> The word is not "bid" but "command".<a name=55:9></a> Peter says, "command me".<a name=55:10></a> I do not know why Peter did not say that when Stephen was martyred.<a name=55:11></a> He stayed in Jerusalem, although the Lord had said, "when they persecute you in this city, flee to the other" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#10:23">Matthew  10:23</a>).<a name=55:12></a> Most of the saints were scattered; they became part of "the dispersion".<a name=55:13></a> They had to walk on the sea, as it were, the troubled sea that arose on the persecution of Stephen; and they joined the Lord in that way.<a name=55:14></a> He had, as it were, commanded them; it was perfectly evident from His instructions to the twelve, that the time had come to leave the boat.<a name=55:15></a>

		Well now, someone here may be in such a boat.<a name=56:1></a> You may say, I was converted there.<a name=56:2></a> Thank God, if you were; wherever you were converted, we can thank God for the conversion, but being converted in a certain setting does not mean in itself that you are to remain there.<a name=56:3></a> The Lord is not in the public profession.<a name=56:4></a> Where is He?<a name=56:5></a> That is the point now.<a name=56:6></a> You say, Well, just now you have been telling me to stick to the saints; to get amongst them.<a name=56:7></a> That is true, but I am speaking now about a boat, and a boat is typically what fits into the water, the agitated thing, it fits in.<a name=56:8></a> There is not a sect in christendom -- not that I am here to accuse -- but there is not a sect in christendom that does not fit in with the world in some sense; not one.<a name=56:9></a> If I were to go over each one consecutively I could show you how they fit in, whereas there <i>is</i> a position today that does <i>not</i> fit into the world.<a name=56:10></a> The Lord was walking on the sea, it does not say He was walking on agitated waters, He was walking on the sea.<a name=56:11></a> That is a new thing for man, it was unheard of before.<a name=56:12></a> People say, Well, this thought of leaving worldly religious associations is new, it is unheard of.<a name=56:13></a> Well, it may be unheard of in your ears, but that does not mean it is unheard of.<a name=56:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the Lord is saying, maybe to someone here, I am in circumstances in which you are not, but still it is I, and I am in them in relation to you, to the end that you should come into them.<a name=56:15></a> The Lord could have gone round the lake, He could have gone over it divinely, He was not walking on the water just to get across, but He was walking on the water <i>in relation to them</i>.<a name=56:16></a> They were in the boat, and they were troubled.<a name=56:17></a> One would be thankful if all the christians in this city were troubled about some movement of Jesus.<a name=56:18></a> He is moving all the time, walking in the midst of the seven golden lamps.<a name=56:19></a> Would that every christian in humanly organised associations were troubled about His movements, it would be an indication that there was something of God in them, some hope, but alas!<a name=56:20></a> there are

		Now, the Lord is walking on the water and the disciples are troubled; they thought He was a spirit; they were hazy and unspiritual, but still He was there in relation to them; that is why He was there.<a name=57:3></a> He is drawing near to them, walking on the sea, but the waters are troubled, they are agitated, and the Lord says, "It is <i>I</i>, be not afraid".<a name=57:4></a> Assuring words!<a name=57:5></a> The One who has said "I Jesus", says, when referring to the saints, They are Myself; that is what He had said to Paul, but now it is not that.<a name=57:6></a> The saints are in the boat, the associations of the boat, and Jesus is alone, nearby on the sea; He is there in relation to those in the boat.<a name=57:7></a> He is walking on the water in relation to them, as I said.<a name=57:8></a> He is in this city moving in relation to someone or many.<a name=57:9></a> Is anyone interested enough to notice?<a name=57:10></a> He says, "It is <i>I</i>, be not afraid", and Peter said, "Lord".<a name=57:11></a> Here is one who is interested, only just one, interested enough to say, "Lord, if it be <i>thou</i>, command me".<a name=57:12></a> It is a question of the Lord's authority, and this extends to us all.<a name=57:13></a> If anyone is not in the right association He would call you out.<a name=57:14></a> The object in what He is saying is that you might ask Him, "if it be <i>thou</i>, command me".<a name=57:15></a> Does the Lord's authority require that I should move?<a name=57:16></a> Yes, it does!<a name=57:17></a> Then it is imperative that I should do so, and so Peter went down out of the ship and walked on the waters to go to Jesus.<a name=57:18></a>

		Now some of you may not have noticed that it was the strength of the wind that caused Peter's fear.<a name=57:19></a> But the Lord had ordered him to come to Him on the water, and hence Peter was perfectly safe in doing so; but he did not use his mind in faith.<a name=57:20></a> Our minds are under our control, our eyes are under our control; hence I must not be baffled by them.<a name=57:21></a> If I am moving under the Lord's authority, I am safe, and I must not be discouraged by feelings arising from opposition.<a name=57:22></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the dispensational thought arises, namely, that the Lord goes into the ship, meaning that it is the Jewish ship, and they come to land.<a name=58:18></a> The effect of all this is that those in the ship are helped, they worship Jesus.<a name=58:19></a> I mean by this that if there is anyone moving on these lines, coming under the Lord's direction and compulsion and finally His command, then others will be affected; it is a movement.<a name=58:20></a> One hears constantly of little or no movement in some places, little or no addition; no outside material secured.<a name=58:21></a> Well, this is the way to it, it is moving under the Lord's compulsion and command, and serving God's law ("<i>I myself</i> with

		Finally, just a word as to Luke.<a name=59:4></a> I wanted to show that the Lord coming in at this time says "<i>I</i> myself".<a name=59:5></a> He had said to those in the boat, "It is I", and to Saul, "I am Jesus", alluding to the saints as His body, but now He has come into their midst, that is the next thing; and we have the pronoun added: "Jesus himself"; as much as to say, These are My own circumstances.<a name=59:6></a> Walking on the sea is not characteristic of His circumstances, He is doing it for a purpose; to lead others to do it; to teach us how to walk, and to be superior to our circumstances, however bad they may be.<a name=59:7></a> Now He has what He may call His own circumstances.<a name=59:8></a> How attractive that thought is!<a name=59:9></a> And what you will notice is, that it is amongst the saints, as those who are talking about Him and His things -- the assembly in its public aspect.<a name=59:10></a> He has come in there and it is "Jesus himself".<a name=59:11></a> We get it indeed earlier when He is seeking to recover two that belonged to the assembly, but who were going away from it, turning their backs on it, though belonging to it -- "two of you".<a name=59:12></a> We may say, it is always <i>Himself</i> to those of the assembly; so that Jesus Himself drew near and went with them.<a name=59:13></a> To any two, or one, turning away from the truth of the assembly, and yet belonging to it, the Lord says, You belong to Me, and you belong to the assembly -- "two of you".<a name=59:14></a> It is not only that you belong to Christ, but you belong to the assembly, the most august body in the universe.<a name=59:15></a> The Lord would impress us with that.<a name=59:16></a> But if you are turning your back on the assembly, you are not <i>characteristically</i> of it, although still belonging to it.<a name=59:17></a> Jesus Himself drew near, as much as to say, You are of these people, you belong to the assembly: why should you be elsewhere?<a name=59:18></a> Jesus Himself drew near and went with them, and then,

		The Lord is greatly helping His people on this point, and I bring it forward now so as to confirm us in what is being done by Him, and if there are any inclined to move away, the Lord would say, You belong to the assembly, do not forget that your place is there.<a name=60:2></a> These two had come back, and they were talking about Jesus, they were telling the others that He was made known to them in the breaking of bread, a sure evidence that they belonged to the company.<a name=60:3></a> What could they know about the breaking of bread if they did not belong to that company?<a name=60:4></a> What does any one in a humanly-made organisation today know about the breaking of bread?<a name=60:5></a> There they do not understand it, they call it 'the sacrament'.<a name=60:6></a> It is not the <i>Lord's</i> supper; but the two at Emmaus belonged to the assembly, and hence knew something of the breaking of bread, and they can tell others that the Lord had appeared to them in the way, and that "he was made known to them in the breaking of bread".<a name=60:7></a> Then, as they were saying these things, the Lord "himself" stood in their midst.<a name=60:8></a> He is now in His own circumstances, normally circumstances corresponding to what He has in heaven.<a name=60:9></a> He says, "it is <i>I</i> myself.<a name=60:10></a> Handle me and see".<a name=60:11></a> He is not a spirit merely; a spirit has not flesh and bones.<a name=60:12></a>

		J.T.<a name=61:8></a> Well, it is important, because it enters into the love that was begotten in Jonathan, and helps in what has been remarked, that it is the most exalted kind of love in so far as seen in this chapter and commented on in <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#1">2 Samuel  1</a>.<a name=61:9></a> Jonathan was evidently affected by what he saw in David, not only in his military exploits, but in his personal character as speaking to Saul.<a name=61:10></a> Chapter 17:57,58 says, "as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.<a name=61:11></a> And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, young man?<a name=61:12></a> And David said, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Beth-lehemite".<a name=61:13></a> Great as were the exploits of David from a military point of view, it would seem that in his demeanour he retained what was proper to him in speaking to the king; although the king was not inducing good feeling by his tone and manner.<a name=61:14></a> Certainly his address to

		J.T.<a name=63:3></a> The way the leading men of the Jews spoke to Him, the tenor of their remarks was generally to discredit the Lord; take Simon the Pharisee, he spoke in his heart, saying, "This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she is a sinner" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7:39">Luke  7:39</a>) -- that would discredit the Lord; the influence he would exert in his house would discredit the Lord, but the Lord's reply would affect the woman.<a name=63:4></a> She was under great reproach in that house, and so was Christ, but she loved Him in spite of the conditions.<a name=63:5></a>

		I have selected Genesis as obviously the section of Scripture in which we should rightly look for the ancient mountains.<a name=97:3></a> Ararat is the first one mentioned, indeed, the idea of mountains only comes in with this section, and Ararat is the first specific mountain mentioned -- it is a range, as is usual.<a name=97:4></a> Sinai was the mount of God; it was a range, too.<a name=97:5></a> So here we have, as you will observe, "the mountains of Ararat", and from the verse in Deuteronomy we are entitled, and I believe obligated by the Spirit, to dwell on the facts recorded as to these mountains.<a name=97:6></a> The first point to be noted is that the ark <i>rested</i> there.<a name=97:7></a> Many believers know little or nothing about rest; but the idea has a great place in Scripture, far more than could be noted now in our short time.<a name=97:8></a>

		What is in view here is Christ in type, reaching, through death, a point of rest.<a name=97:9></a> That is one of the "best" things that one can mention, one of the chief themes of the gospel, that Christ as Man, having come in here to a world of death, has gone through death and reached a resting-place -- solid ground for faith.<a name=97:10></a> We are told by Peter that "God .<a name=97:11></a>.<a name=97:12></a>.<a name=97:13></a> raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:21">1 Peter  1:21</a>).<a name=97:14></a> As Man, He is on solid ground, making a way for us.<a name=97:15></a> It is one of the chief themes of the gospel; there could be no gospel without it; everyone of us doubtless knows that in his own soul, but it is well to be reminded of it.<a name=97:16></a> "The ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the mountains of Ararat" -- a great point reached in this great type.<a name=97:17></a>

		So after forty days, which has its own meaning, Noah opened the window of the ark and sent out a raven, a carnivorous bird.<a name=98:9></a> As a believer apprehends Christ above and gets peace in a sense, this state below, which the raven here points to, is often very uncertain.<a name=98:10></a> The dove is another thought -- delightful in contrast: but, as I hope to show, the raven and the dove go together in the believer's experience.<a name=98:11></a> It is not that the raven in itself is to be abominated, it fits here and enters into the divine work in the believer; it goes to and fro, it is restless, but it does not return to Noah, it can get along without him and without the ark.<a name=98:12></a> In a literal sense, what did it matter if the raven perished?<a name=98:13></a> It is the typical meaning we have to see, and that God would nourish us with.<a name=98:14></a> The raven continued "going

		I cannot dwell at length on this remarkable picture, but it is one of the best things of the ancient mountains.<a name=99:8></a> Young people need to note it, to read it carefully, because it contemplates an end reached, not in the raven, but in the dove; that is the fruit of the Spirit, and once that is reached, solid rock has been reached in the soul of the believer -- that is, he no longer sows to the flesh, but to the Spirit: "the mind of the flesh is death; but the mind of the Spirit life and peace".<a name=99:9></a> The <i>state</i> of the believer thus corresponds with the resting of the ark on the top of the mountains: the latter is <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#4:25">Romans  4:25</a>, the former <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:6">Romans  8:6</a>.<a name=99:10></a> And now we have means for the propagation of a new order of things in the soul of one man or woman, or in any number -- in the whole race of men in result in the

		The Spirit strives with young believers like that -- ready to be there; but the dove finds no rest for the sole of her foot and returns, not to the ark simply, but to Noah, for there is a personal link with him: "he put forth his hand, and took her, and brought her to him into the ark".<a name=100:3></a> There is a beautiful personal touch and link there to be understood by the believer.<a name=100:4></a> Then he sent her out again; there are seven days, and other seven days, and so on.<a name=100:5></a> Let us look into our histories, dear brethren: this refers to them, these spiritual periods we have to go through in order to reach solid rock spiritually; no longer this undulating condition, misery today and joy tomorrow, and so on; but a steady peace -- "The mind of the Spirit is life and peace" -- not simply peace with God, as in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>, but <i>life and peace</i>, as in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>.<a name=100:6></a> If you look through <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>you will be impressed, if you have not already been, with the allusions to the Spirit of God, the varied functions and services performed by Him in the believer's soul, so that we are in conscious relationship with God as children and as sons.<a name=100:7></a> We are so free of this uncertainty inwardly that the Spirit of God can actually witness to our spirits that we are children of God -- a most comforting and blessed thought: the witness of the Spirit within.<a name=100:8></a>

		So we read that Noah "waited yet other seven days, and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark.<a name=100:9></a> And the dove came to him at eventide; and behold, in her beak was an olive-leaf plucked off".<a name=100:10></a> Now, if I apply this as I have been applying it, it is the <i>fruit of the Spirit</i> in the christian; that is, it is an olive-leaf <i>plucked off</i>, not a floating one.<a name=100:11></a> An undelivered christian might come to this room and hear something good and rejoice in it, and a little while after lose the joy he had.<a name=100:12></a> Now that means it has not <i>grown in himself</i>, it was the outcome

		Then we find that "Noah knew that the waters had become low on the earth", that is how we know where the soul is.<a name=101:4></a> This is a great matter, this inward thing; we arrive at solid ground and we know where we are, and we have reached continuous joy -- a very blessed state to reach.<a name=101:5></a> So that the exhortation comes: "Rejoice evermore" -- that is the word!<a name=101:6></a> Why should it be otherwise?<a name=101:7></a> "The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, .<a name=101:8></a>.<a name=101:9></a>.<a name=101:10></a>" we are told; love and joy are the fruits first mentioned.<a name=101:11></a> Now when that point is reached there is no more returning of the dove; she has a wide field now to go on with, the great field of God's work in man, for in truth, "that world, and the resurrection" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#20:35">Luke  20:35</a>) which the Lord speaks of is begun already.<a name=101:12></a> It begins in the saints, and so is applicable to every one of us as this fruit is reached, the actual fruit of the Spirit; then the Holy Spirit is at liberty to move on; the dove does not return any more to Noah.<a name=101:13></a> What a field opens up as the waters are dried up!<a name=101:14></a> Now death is understood to have been annulled -- Christ "has annulled death, and brought to light life and incorruptibility by the glad tidings" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1:10">2 Timothy  1:10</a>).<a name=101:15></a> So that one now has entered on a world of life, death is no longer in the way.<a name=101:16></a> Viewed as typical, what we have here is a new world opened up for the believer, involving the Spirit operating in him.<a name=101:17></a> A great domain opens up through the death and resurrection of Christ and the solid work of the Spirit in the believer, so that

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What is particularly now the occasion of these crises is heavenly truth, the truth of Christ in heaven, and that the assembly is heavenly: that the service of God is heavenly and that the saints themselves are heavenly, and this is not merely on the first day of the week, but every day of the week -- for it is on the corners of the garments the tassel is to be (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#15">Numbers  15</a>).<a name=103:4></a> When we turn from the first day to the second day, which may mean a test, there is means to carry us through so that we maintain the heavenly colour.<a name=103:5></a> Now that is the point, so that we have here the word to Abraham out of heaven the second time: it is out of heaven, it is a heavenly matter.<a name=103:6></a> Even Isaac has to go into death: Christ typically.<a name=103:7></a> This scripture shows us that, not only the raven character in ourselves has to go, as in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>and 8, but that Christ must die, as in His condition in flesh and blood here on earth.<a name=103:8></a> That condition was not what the counsels of God required; for that He must have Christ in another condition.<a name=103:9></a> Not, of course, that it was obligatory on Christ to die; no one could take His life from Him, He was personally immune from death; but, taking on a character of life which He intended to lay down, and which the will of God required should be laid down sacrificially, He "died for our sins according to the scriptures" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:3">1 Corinthians  15:3</a>).<a name=103:10></a> The order of the life of Jesus here on earth was of a character of its own, "holy, harmless, undefiled, separated from sinners" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#7:26">Hebrews  7:26</a>).<a name=103:11></a> Still, it was to be laid down, He could die, He could lay it down, and He did lay it down -- the glory of God in the accomplishment of

		J.T.<a name=120:1></a> It is in mind that we might consider together the <i>voice of Christ</i> as in these passages, first the voice of the Bridegroom, then the voice of the Son of God, then the Shepherd's voice, then His voice which those that seek the truth discern, as in chapter 18: "Every one that is of the truth hears my voice".<a name=120:2></a> What is particularly in mind is the voice of the Bridegroom.<a name=120:3></a> The way it appears in this gospel is striking, for it is heard by one who is "sent from God" (chapter 1:6), and it was before John was cast into prison, that is, before the Lord definitely entered upon His service.<a name=120:4></a> So that it is obvious that from the very outset the Bridegroom's voice was to be heard; showing how prominently the marital thought was in the Lord's mind as become Man, and as entering upon His service.<a name=120:5></a> Inasmuch as John's gospel bears on the last days, as we have often heard, the Bridegroom's voice is intended to be heard by us peculiarly.<a name=120:6></a> The Lord is presently to say, and perhaps has said it in the ministry: "<i>I</i> am the root and offspring of David, the bright and morning star" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:16">Revelation  22:16</a>).<a name=120:7></a> To this the Spirit and the bride, answering, say, Come.<a name=120:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So that it would seem as if John's ministry is particularly calculated to arouse interest in us in this respect, as in others.<a name=120:9></a> It is he who, in ministry, brings in "the bride, the Lamb's wife".<a name=120:10></a> He speaks about the wife, alluding to the assembly as in her faithfulness during the Lord's absence.<a name=120:11></a> The other evangelists, particularly Matthew, speak about the Bridegroom, but the bride is not formally spoken of, although the bride-chamber is.<a name=120:12></a> Inasmuch as the synoptic gospels give us the official ministry of Christ, as we may call it -- that is, after John is cast into prison -- we can see from the very earliest that the idea was there with the Lord; He, as it were, had it uppermost in His mind in ministering,

		H.H.<a name=121:7></a> Would you say this is a special moment in which we can hear the Bridegroom's voice?<a name=121:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=121:9></a> Yes, not simply what is said, although what is said is implied, of course, but the <i>voice</i>, which brings in the <i>personal</i> side; whether it be the Lord speaking, as it were, unofficially, as John presents Him at the beginning, or officially after John the baptist is cast into prison, there was that voice; that is to say, it is a voice discernible.<a name=121:10></a> There was something in Christ's discourses, remarks, or conversations that came to the Baptist's ears as a personal testimony to His affections for a bride, whoever she might be.<a name=121:11></a> The idea of seeking a bride is old.<a name=121:12></a> It is well in all these matters to revert back, for truth is cumulative; it is built up from the outset in view of Christ coming in.<a name=121:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So that the idea of seeking a bride is as old as Genesis.<a name=121:14></a> Abraham's servant went to seek one for Isaac; Jacob went to seek one for himself; and in that way faith would understand that there must be something of this in Christ becoming Man.<a name=121:15></a> Not only had there been the idea of seeking a bride or a wife of old, but God had formerly regarded Israel as in that relation to Himself.<a name=121:16></a> The Old Testament, especially the prophets, abounds with allusions to the divine affections, having in view an answer in the sense of marital relation; all that would be embodied in the incarnation.<a name=121:17></a> The primary thought of a wife was not from man, but from God.<a name=121:18></a> God thought of one for Adam, and evidently Adam was pleased with the creature, so like himself, brought to him by God, and from that point onwards the idea took root in man.<a name=121:19></a> It was part of the divine thought; it was not an afterthought; it was in the divine counsels,

	<div class="paragraph">
		and in due course came in historically.<a name=122:1></a> God said: "It is not good that Man should be alone; I will make him a helpmate" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:18">Genesis  2:18</a>), which He did, and presented her to Adam; and from that point onwards the thought as in man develops particularly in men of faith, as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph; then in Moses, David, and Solomon -- in fact, the idea increases as we go on in the line of faith; so that it all headed up in Christ as Man, and John the baptist, with the ear of faith, heard the Bridegroom's voice.<a name=122:2></a> He does not say anything about the voice of the bride, but he heard the Bridegroom's voice.<a name=122:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.C.<a name=122:4></a>S.<a name=122:5></a> So, going back to the beginning, to Adam and Eve, the union there is really an indication of what was already in the mind of God in regard to Christ and the assembly?<a name=122:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=122:7></a> Quite so.<a name=122:8></a> Christ is not an afterthought with God: He was in the beginning with God, and when God announced the thought of a helpmate for man, He had Christ in mind.<a name=122:9></a> So Eve becomes a striking -- and, in a certain sense, the greatest -- type of the assembly.<a name=122:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=122:21></a> It is remarkable, especially with a man like John, who was not himself a family man, but a man brought up in the deserts -- in an austere way.<a name=122:22></a> He goes as far as to say, "He that hath the bride", without saying who she was: it was clear in his mind in principle, at least, that the bride existed.<a name=122:23></a>

		C.A.<a name=123:1></a>C.<a name=123:2></a> How does this link on with the thought of Jehovah betrothing Israel to Himself in the Old Testament?<a name=123:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=123:4></a> I suppose that John would in faith gather up all that; so that if Jehovah is characteristically the Bridegroom, if God enters into a relation like that, it must be the final, complete thought, and that thought now took form in Christ here, who is no less than God.<a name=123:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=123:10></a> It seems that John the baptist must represent the cumulative thoughts of the Old Testament.<a name=123:11></a> He came in on that line: there was no greater than he on that line.<a name=123:12></a> If he looks at Christ coming to him as he is baptising, he names Him as "the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world" (chapter 1:29).<a name=123:13></a> That would be a cumulative thought, embodying the great sacrificial line of truth from Abel downwards, would you say?<a name=123:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=123:15></a>C.<a name=123:16></a> Yes, I think so.<a name=123:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=123:18></a> "The Lamb of God" conveyed a sacrificial thought, and it arose in John's mind in his seeing Jesus coming to him as he was figuratively administering death.<a name=123:19></a> So on the same line I should think that the marital thought running through would be discerned as embodied in Christ, the idea of the Bridegroom, that the Lord is not doleful or in any way disappointed in any circumstance: whatever appeared in Him was going through; He was buoyant in it; there was a certainty that He would overcome in everything.<a name=123:20></a>

		J.T.<a name=124:1></a> They run together, I should think.<a name=124:2></a> I may remark that one has in view the service of God in what has been said so far, and how the worshippers of God are secured; for that is a leading thought in John: <i>the Father seeks worshippers</i>.<a name=124:3></a> As to this, the question is of what the worshippers of God have in their <i>minds</i>.<a name=124:4></a> What are they built up in?<a name=124:5></a> There is creation and generation.<a name=124:6></a> The first wife, Eve, was a creation, but in the subsequent wives noted particularly, the idea was family distinction, family equality.<a name=124:7></a> I do not know if that is clear, and whether it fits in with your thought: perhaps you will enlarge upon what you have in your mind?<a name=124:8></a>

		C.A.<a name=124:9></a>C.<a name=124:10></a> I was thinking that perhaps the family thought has been more in our minds than the marital thought, and whether some adjustment might be needful to bring us more fully into the mind of God.<a name=124:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=124:12></a> Well, I think the marital thought has not had the place in the service of God that it deserves.<a name=124:13></a> We have rightly made much of the family, that is, we are brethren of Christ, God's sons, and the family idea must take precedence, at least from the standpoint of the Father.<a name=124:14></a> Abraham's thought, that which he caused his servant to swear to, was a question of family equality in the bride.<a name=124:15></a> Ultimately, it seems to me, the family is the leading feature, that is, in the eternal state of things.<a name=124:16></a> What God has before Him in regard to Himself is sonship, and what Christ has before Him in regard to Himself is brethren; but the marital relation comes in strikingly, as in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21">Revelation  21</a>, and the peculiar felicity attaching to it, and the corresponding influence it exerts in the whole domain, is what, perhaps, has been overlooked -- that which is in relation to the voice of the Bridegroom.<a name=124:17></a>

		J.T.<a name=125:6></a> Yes, only I should not like to make all that goes on in the introduction to the service of God horizontal, because we have to do with the Lord as partaking of His supper; and there it is descending love and ascending love.<a name=125:7></a> But we go on to the thought of companionship with Christ, He being then on our side; hence a change of ground in the service.<a name=125:8></a> What is needed is that brethren should see that we are to be <i>made</i> worshippers; that we are to be constituted worshippers, and that we should see what it is that constitutes us worshippers.<a name=125:9></a> We are to be rich enough in intelligence and feeling to answer to any given requirement in the service of God: as the point is reached according to the order that governs it, we are equal to it.<a name=125:10></a> So that much is held in abeyance in our souls until we reach a certain point, and then we are ready for what is required, the Spirit acting in us according to it.<a name=125:11></a>

		These scriptures speak of <i>signs</i>, and in speaking of them my hope is that the Lord will enable me to make a present application.<a name=157:1></a> The idea of signs is prevalent throughout Scripture, and bears on our times in the book of Revelation.<a name=157:2></a> There were those who sought a sign from the Lord, a sign from heaven, as if there had not been any from Him, whereas He was Himself a sign from the outset, as a Babe; and the works which none other man did, had been done by Him, were every one signs.<a name=157:3></a> Yet unbelief and impudence would ask of Him a sign from heaven.<a name=157:4></a> His reply was: Hypocrites!<a name=157:5></a> For hypocrisy marks those who are unbelieving as to what is before their eyes, what all can see.<a name=157:6></a> However, He would give them one, not that which is spoken of in the first scripture, but "the sign of Jonas", that as Jonas was three days and three nights in the belly of the fish, so the Son of man should be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#12:40">Matthew  12:40</a>).<a name=157:7></a> The Son of man!<a name=157:8></a> Most solemn of signs, and one that spoke volumes as to human guilt for, if He who knew no sin had to enter into death and remain there for three days and three nights, the responsibility must belong to others.<a name=157:9></a> The responsibility attached to man, the cause lay in the race.<a name=157:10></a> Later He says, "The Son of man is about to be delivered up into the hands of men, and they shall kill him" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#17:22">Matthew  17:22</a>,23).<a name=157:11></a> A most solemn matter, one that is intended to come home with convicting power even in our own time.<a name=157:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As I was saying, the idea of signs comes down into our dispensation, and (as I shall be showing presently at greater length) particularly in the Apocalypse, which is a book of signs: "Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him .<a name=157:13></a>.<a name=157:14></a>.<a name=157:15></a> ; and he signified it, sending by

		his angel, to his bondman John, who testified the word of God, and the testimony of Jesus Christ, all things that he saw" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:1">Revelation  1:1</a>,2).<a name=158:1></a> God gave it to Him, and He humbly takes the mediatorial place as receiving it.<a name=158:2></a> Indeed, He says, "of that day or of that hour no one knows, neither the angels who are in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father" (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#13:32">Mark  13:32</a>).<a name=158:3></a> But now He has received it -- "which God gave to him".<a name=158:4></a> The giving of this Apocalypse to the Son was a great event.<a name=158:5></a> But I speak of the word <i>signified</i>.<a name=158:6></a> It refers to signs, and we cannot read Revelation intelligently save as we understand signs; each sign is intended to convey an impression, a prophetic impression, indeed, on ourselves, for the book was sent to all the assemblies.<a name=158:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, having said so much in an introductory way, I refer to the first scripture.<a name=158:8></a> It comes in in a most gracious way, for the house of David in pretended piety had refused a sign, and yet Jehovah spoke directly to Ahaz, showing how false piety may preclude from us the most precious communications and guidance.<a name=158:9></a> The house of David was wearying men and now wearying God -- a remarkable charge; and we easily take on this attitude, assuming to have a better knowledge of certain circumstances than God.<a name=158:10></a> He says to Ahaz: "Ask for thee a sign from Jehovah thy God; ask for it in the deep, or in the height above".<a name=158:11></a> He was ready to do anything in this sense for that house, now failing, although presently to be brightly represented in Hezekiah.<a name=158:12></a> What seemed hopeless had a bright result.<a name=158:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish you to note that the allusion in the sign is not to God's power, but to power in the virgin; that is to say, in such circumstances of unbelief, indifference and false piety, the allusion is to the virgin state.<a name=158:14></a> It is not the only such reference in this prophecy, for later on the virgin daughter of Zion defies the king of Assyria, showing what military power attaches to the virgin state, that is, the state that is unconquered by the world -- a precious commodity, one of the most valuable in our day.<a name=158:15></a> We see how it shines in the gospels, but then

		in God's power, for the incoming of the Son of God was a mighty transaction of God; indeed of His own, for the Word <i>became</i> flesh.<a name=159:1></a> It was a mighty operation, and the enemy would becloud its significance.<a name=159:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In our scripture it is the virgin's power, and so I touch on that humbly and simply, only to enhance it, touching on it, I trust, holily.<a name=159:3></a> It is the virgin's power that is the sign.<a name=159:4></a> The babe, indeed, was a sign according to Luke.<a name=159:5></a> "This is the sign to you: ye shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling-clothes, and lying in a manger" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:12">Luke  2:12</a>).<a name=159:6></a> That was the announcement of the angel to the shepherds.<a name=159:7></a> But the sign here is the virgin conceiving and bringing forth a son.<a name=159:8></a> In truth it is not <i>a</i> virgin, the proper rendering is <i>the</i> virgin, as if there were only one, and there could be only one in this wonderful transaction.<a name=159:9></a> Heaven would not think of another; in the sense conveyed, there could not be another.<a name=159:10></a> It is <i>the</i> virgin, one marked off prophetically and in due course here.<a name=159:11></a> But then, I am speaking of the quality of the condition, the subjective condition afforded to all, and that is the sign here.<a name=159:12></a> She shall bring forth a son and call (<i>she</i> calls) his name Immanuel.<a name=159:13></a> Let us think of this for a moment, over against Ahaz and all that marked him as of the house of David, to say nothing of the house of Israel, its wretched confederacy with Syria.<a name=159:14></a> Think what confederacies there are about us today religiously -- independent companies joining up, assuming to have virtue in themselves?<a name=159:15></a> "Say ye not, A confederacy", the Spirit says in this section.<a name=159:16></a> The idea of a confederacy is obvious -- independent companies joining up with independent companies, and all against Jerusalem and the house of David; the house of David itself poor and weak, and represented as unbelieving and pretending to false piety, but still it was the house of David, to which great thoughts and promises attached.<a name=159:17></a> So what was needed over against Ahaz's unbelief was this virgin state, this subjective condition, seen strikingly in Mary in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1">Luke  1</a>; and it is
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=160>[Page 160]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that which triumphs.<a name=160:1></a> The sign here is this condition and the result of it.<a name=160:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Much could be said of Christ's birth.<a name=160:3></a> It is the greatest of subjects, His death and resurrection being its counterpart.<a name=160:4></a> There could be no death of Christ without the birth of Christ, hence they are bound together.<a name=160:5></a> His death is involved, for indeed He "came by water and blood" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:6">1 John  5:6</a>).<a name=160:6></a> He had that in mind.<a name=160:7></a> Not that death was on Him personally.<a name=160:8></a> Never!<a name=160:9></a> It is blasphemy to assume that it was.<a name=160:10></a> Nobody could take His life from Him, but still He came to die.<a name=160:11></a> Others did the killing, alas -- "ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:23">Acts  2:23</a>) -- but He has entered in once for all, into the holy of holies, having obtained an eternal redemption.<a name=160:12></a> So that the incarnation and death of Christ stand together -- the first great event being the sign here: the Babe; and not only the Babe, but the virgin state through which He was brought forth.<a name=160:13></a> That is what I wish to stress, the virgin condition, the unconquered condition in holiness, that which stands out against all the attacks of the enemy to corrupt.<a name=160:14></a> That was available in Mary, and as it is, in a spiritual sense now, available for God, something for Him will be brought forth.<a name=160:15></a> "I again travail in birth", says one in true virgin feeling, true motherly feeling, too, "until Christ shall have been formed in you" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:19">Galatians  4:19</a>); and that is what is needed, the formation of Christ, the reproduction of Christ in true formation in the saints.<a name=160:16></a> That is surely a sign.<a name=160:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is all I have to say on that point.<a name=160:18></a> I come now to chapter 8, which is a counterpart of the other, that is, the children which God gave to Christ -- without saying anything about a mother.<a name=160:19></a> It is now the paternal side.<a name=160:20></a> The Assyrian had come up, and he had gone too far.<a name=160:21></a> A comfort to us as the enemy is attempting to interfere with the rights of God in His people -- doing it, indeed, succeeding, too; but then the remnant said, "God is with us!<a name=160:22></a>" which is "Immanuel" interpreted.<a name=160:23></a>

		Let confederacy be made; let the Assyrian come up -- under God he may come up as needed for discipline, but presently he goes too far.<a name=161:1></a> He goes "further", reaching "even to the neck"; but it is Immanuel's land.<a name=161:2></a> Who can contend with Immanuel?<a name=161:3></a> That is the refuge for the remnant now -- Immanuel's land!<a name=161:4></a> The enemy knew not what he was doing, he had touched on the rights of God in Christ.<a name=161:5></a> We can pray on those lines, and if we do we shall be heard.<a name=161:6></a> Hardly anything is of more importance than to pray intelligently.<a name=161:7></a> Many prayers are fervent, but with little or no intelligence or faith.<a name=161:8></a> Daniel prayed intelligently, he opened books that conveyed the mind of God and read them.<a name=161:9></a> Prayer should be on that principle -- "the word of God and prayer" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#4:5">1 Timothy  4:5</a>).<a name=161:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the history of the assembly, the Levites arrogated priesthood to themselves: that is, because one had a gift, or clerical office, he became a priest.<a name=163:2></a> This beclouded the whole position.<a name=163:3></a> So this chapter is to recover the idea, particularly that of the high priest, for it is heavenly.<a name=163:4></a> There is no high priest on earth.<a name=163:5></a> "If he were on earth, he would not be a priest" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#8:4">Hebrews  8:4</a>).<a name=163:6></a> I mean, the priesthood in which we have part is a heavenly one, not one that can be attached to things set up here as if they belonged to this world, such as cathedrals and all that.<a name=163:7></a> Hebrews is to show that our High Priest, our priesthood, is heavenly.<a name=163:8></a> So the passage brings out that Joshua's filthy garments are taken away from him -- and, as typical of what exists today, what rubbish!<a name=163:9></a> How unfit to be worn by a true priest!<a name=163:10></a> Priestly garments today, such as the world recognises, are unfit for a true priest.<a name=163:11></a> True, priestly garments are found in remnant times, as we may see in Ezra and Nehemiah.<a name=163:12></a> Nehemiah himself gave five hundred and thirty priests' coats.<a name=163:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Joshua was clothed in filthy garments, as we have noted, but God was coming in sovereignly to change those garments.<a name=163:14></a> How happy to see a christian who has worn these filthy garments -- filthy in a spiritual sense -- disrobed of them and clothed not only with true priestly garments, but with such as are called festival garments!<a name=163:15></a> Not the dull experience attaching to the clergy, for in truth it is generally dull and heavy, whatever interest and excitement there may be in the public exercise of the clerical office.<a name=163:16></a> In itself it is a dull matter, to say the least, nothing festive about it, nothing happy and free; those engaged in it are relatively isolated; in principle above and apart from the laity, there is but little mutual feeling.<a name=163:17></a> One great principle of the assembly is mutual feeling and enjoyment in holy things.<a name=163:18></a> They sang a hymn -- that is the

	<div class="paragraph">
		What is in mind in reading these scriptures, speaking as they do of well-known persons, is to show how the work of God is currently operative.<a name=168:1></a> There is amenableness to immediate adjustment where will <i>has been</i> at work.<a name=168:2></a> Adjustment in divine things is always necessitated by will or ignorance in us.<a name=168:3></a> From the divine side there is no need of adjustment.<a name=168:4></a> The wonderful economy into which we are brought remains in perfect love as it was when first inaugurated; nor can there be any change.<a name=168:5></a> As indeed in the physical universe, things go on; all runs on unalterably according to divine design and purpose.<a name=168:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is in the moral system that adjustment is needed, but only from our side.<a name=168:7></a> From God's side all is perfect.<a name=168:8></a> And so where in any way there is need for regulation spiritually, we may at once and with certainty put it down to the action of our wills.<a name=168:9></a> I may remark at this point that the people of God and men generally -- but I speak particularly to the saints of God -- are too prone to assume that things are optional and that at any time, however long will may have persisted, one may change his mind.<a name=168:10></a> That is, it is always regarded as optional with us.<a name=168:11></a> In view of the dispensation into which we have come, it is so <i>generally</i>, for God is waiting for any returning prodigal, but with all that, the <i>government</i> of God stands and is interwoven in the dispensation, although we rightly speak of it as one of grace.<a name=168:12></a> Grace reigns, but the government of God also subsists.<a name=168:13></a> We find, therefore, that He speaks in the Scripture of fixedness, whether for good or for evil, in persons during their lives here; fixedness, of course, lies with those of us who are true believers in Christ.<a name=168:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		but then the idea must be extended to us in regard of our part and place in relation to the tabernacle, or the testimony; and what Scripture makes plain is that in the working of will, God may fix a position, even whilst believers are here in the body.<a name=169:1></a> This is one of the most solemn things to be considered.<a name=169:2></a> It is one of the most blessed things, one of the most assuring thoughts as to the true believer from the standpoint of his eternal portion, but from the standpoint of his position in relation to the testimony here, it may become a most solemn matter.<a name=169:3></a> The abandonment by anyone of his place in that testimony may mean fixedness from the divine side, that is, if you will have it so, God will give you to understand that it is as you wish it.<a name=169:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Take, for instance, in the corrective epistle (1 Corinthians), which treats of the relation of the saints to the testimony, that is to say, whether they are in it or out of it, we have the statement: "But if any be ignorant" (chapter 14:38).<a name=169:5></a> Let him be that!<a name=169:6></a> But, you might say, that is not in keeping with grace.<a name=169:7></a> But God would remind us that, while we may think things are optional on our side, they are not so.<a name=169:8></a> Even in regard of repentance, God opens the door for it, grants it, and this makes man's position extremely solemn, more so than most of us have realised.<a name=169:9></a> God fixes things in this sense, not only in regard of the unsaved, but in regard of the saints, and, as I said, it is a most solemn consideration.<a name=169:10></a> That things are fixed in regard of the unsaved there can be no question.<a name=169:11></a> "But if also our gospel is veiled, it is veiled in those that are lost" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:3">2 Corinthians  4:3</a>).<a name=169:12></a> And again, "Let him that does unrighteously do unrighteously still; and let the filthy make himself filthy still .<a name=169:13></a>.<a name=169:14></a>.<a name=169:15></a>" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:11">Revelation  22:11</a>).<a name=169:16></a> The Spirit says these things.<a name=169:17></a> God is fixing the matter in the <i>lifetime</i> of ignorant, unrighteous, and filthy persons.<a name=169:18></a> God would have us to understand that we have to do with Him and that He is a consuming fire, and that He has His own way.<a name=169:19></a> His government is perfectly compatible with His grace.<a name=169:20></a> As His government

		The corrective epistle I have alluded to speaks of certain saints who partook of the Lord's supper thus: "On this account many among you are weak and infirm, and a good many are fallen asleep" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:30">1 Corinthians  11:30</a>).<a name=170:3></a> They were misbehaving in relation to the Lord's supper, and God was disciplining them in this extreme way, some of them losing their places in the testimony.<a name=170:4></a> The only remedy now was to take them away through death.<a name=170:5></a> John says of such cases, "I do not say of that that he should make a request" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:16">1 John  5:16</a>).<a name=170:6></a> In the present paralysed condition of the christian profession persons regarded as "lost" cannot be easily identified, but that they exist Scripture makes plain.<a name=170:7></a> And God would have us all to make our "calling and election sure" (<a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#1:10">2 Peter  1:10</a>), that we may not be trifling with Him, assuming that we can take things on or leave them; assuming that, although we have eyes to see, we are justified in <i>not</i> seeing!<a name=170:8></a> God would say, Why not have eyes to see?<a name=170:9></a> I give them to you!<a name=170:10></a> Everyone who is born of God ought to be able to see the things of God.<a name=170:11></a> "Except any one be born anew he cannot see .<a name=170:12></a>.<a name=170:13></a>.<a name=170:14></a>" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:3">John  3:3</a>), but if he is, he can!<a name=170:15></a> The work of God enables us to see things and if we do not, let us not excuse ourselves.<a name=170:16></a> Adjustment is always on our side.<a name=170:17></a> Do not blame God if things are seen by others and you do not see them.<a name=170:18></a> If you continue to say, I do not see, the will is at work.<a name=170:19></a> Your position as outside the testimony may become fixed -- a most solemn thing.<a name=170:20></a>

		But the Lord had something more to deal with than the deficiency of wine at that marriage.<a name=171:19></a> And so it is constantly; something more than the absence of the wine of joy has to be dealt with, and that is fleshly insinuation, fleshly assumption on natural grounds -- the very things that make the wine deficient in a spiritual sense.<a name=171:20></a> Anyone with a sense of superior knowledge to Christ is the person who is making the wine deficient.<a name=171:21></a> The Lord deals with that, He puts that right in the most effective way, and what is so beautiful is that Mary is amenable to His correction.<a name=171:22></a> Amenability to immediate adjustment is of great importance; for if I continue on in the action of my will, God would say, Let it be that way!<a name=171:23></a> Let him be ignorant!<a name=171:24></a> Let him be filthy still!<a name=171:25></a> How solemn are those words!<a name=171:26></a>

		I believe that David was taken up with this in view; not only as a type of Christ, but as a type of the saints too.<a name=197:8></a> We join in with Christ and thus become the inheritance of God, as <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:18">Ephesians  1:18</a> says.<a name=197:9></a> This is a matter which all will recognise to be of the greatest importance as we are drawing near to the end: that there should be completion.<a name=197:10></a> The Spirit is here, according to the Lord's own words, not only to teach us, but to <i>guide</i> us into <i>all</i> the truth; and there will be triumph if this comes about in the last days.<a name=197:11></a> So the book of Revelation, which contemplates the last days, both as regards the government of God and the work of God in the assembly, brings in David in a striking manner; the Lord saying that He "has the key of David" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:7">Revelation  3:7</a>), which would undoubtedly signify that He can open up things authoritatively.<a name=197:12></a> So that, however few may be true, or however small the position, there is authority -- there is authority in the opening up of the truth.<a name=197:13></a> The Lord would assert that amongst us.<a name=197:14></a>

		root and offspring of David" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:16">Revelation  22:16</a>); this would mean that He has confidence, that with the opening that is made for the saints, as things advance, there has been inquiry in the truth -- the <i>Root</i> of David involving the gospel of John and the <i>Offspring</i> involving Matthew.<a name=198:1></a> So that as He presents Himself in these relations "the Spirit and the bride say, Come" (verse 17), which would indicate that the assembly is ready in a practical way, answering to all that He has opened up with authority in His service through many years.<a name=198:2></a> Now there is a response, on the part of the Spirit and the bride.<a name=198:3></a> It would seem as if the Spirit is exultant in the work He has accomplished -- not simply teaching us, but guiding us into all the truth.<a name=198:4></a>

		Corresponding with Revelation, it would seem that the prophets confirm Christ's service as David, in this respect, in the thought of the service of God.<a name=198:5></a> David appears in the prophets both in this connection and in relation to Israel in the future militarily.<a name=198:6></a> David is to be their king, and their shepherd and their prince (see <a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#37:24">Ezekiel  37:24</a>,25).<a name=198:7></a> Christ, as David, is known now in the assembly as in relation to the service of God.<a name=198:8></a> So, in the Davidic character there is the working out of the service of song; one of the most interesting thoughts that can come before us; all hingeing on Christ as known amongst us in His attractiveness as in our first scripture.<a name=198:9></a> Then in Chronicles, David is the centre of everything for the people of God.<a name=198:10></a> These six readings ought to lead us to <a href="../bible/2Chronicles.htm#5">2 Chronicles  5</a>.<a name=198:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the section before us now, David is more a type of a believer learning; ending in the acceptance of sonship in chapter 17.<a name=215:4></a> It is clear that, as Christ comes before us personally, learning on our side is necessary so that we should reach experimentally what we see in Him in an objective way.<a name=215:5></a> In John's gospel, for instance, we begin with the Person of Christ peculiarly, coming in in the last days when saints are separated from each other through bad teaching, involving sectarianism; true believers are drawn together through increased attraction to Christ.<a name=215:6></a> And then, as disciples become attracted to Him, they have in mind immediately that He is a <i>Teacher</i>.<a name=215:7></a> So that John's gospel may be regarded as marked by teaching and discipleship; we see in it those who learn.<a name=215:8></a> It seems as if this section of 1 Chronicles is similarly marked by divine instruction received on the part of a believer, sometimes through failure, but the failures recorded in this book are rather on account of the result of them in David.<a name=215:9></a> They have that in view more than mere history; hence chapter 15 records the acknowledgment by David of his failure, and that of the people, in undertaking to bring the ark of God on a <i>cart</i>; a sin that is common today; that is, worldly principles adopted in the service of God; and from which many, as judging it, are learning.<a name=215:10></a> No doubt we have all had our part in this.<a name=215:11></a> What is stressed here is the thoroughness with which the instruction is received, also the thoroughness of the correction involved.<a name=215:12></a> Chapter 15 stresses that; indeed, one lesson in

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=216:6></a> Well, that is the next point.<a name=216:7></a> We have arrived at kingship; all the people make David king -- he is thoroughly that; he is in their hearts as king, but now he drops to the level of a believer who would serve God.<a name=216:8></a> He looks back on history, and sends to his brethren everywhere, in all the lands of Israel, and with them to the priests and Levites, and says: "Let us bring again the ark of our God to us; for we inquired not of it in the days of Saul" (chapter 13:3).<a name=216:9></a> That is the position now; the believer looks back and takes account of the failure of earlier days.<a name=216:10></a> It was a sorrowful thing that in all the days of Saul the ark was not inquired of; and then the desire to rectify the position leads to the use of a cart, whereas it should have been carried on the shoulders of the Levites.<a name=216:11></a> No doubt most of the brethren recognise that for many years back the Lord has been helping as to <i>order</i> in the service of God; that there should be rigid exclusion of human innovations and a return to divine order.<a name=216:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		Then another thing that comes out is the long period during which the ark was in the house of Abinadab on the hill, and yet in all that time, Abinadab and his house never seemed to be concerned as to the law governing the care of the ark.<a name=217:4></a> It indicates how we may be interested in Christ as seen in the ark, and yet never inquire in a priestly way as to Him; as to what is required of us, and what is due to Him.<a name=217:5></a> The two sons of Abinadab drove the cart, "And they carried the ark of God on a new cart out of the house of Abinadab; and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart" (chapter 13:7).<a name=217:6></a> David and Israel played before Jehovah with all their might.<a name=217:7></a> A great error passes unnoticed; what was being done was evidently regarded as right and for God; but God was not pleased with the thing, although there was much evidence of energy in David and all Israel; they "played before God with all their might, and with singing, and with harps, and with lutes, and with tambours, and with cymbals, and with trumpets" (verse 8).<a name=217:8></a> How much of this there may be in the service, and yet God is displeased all the time!<a name=217:9></a>

		J.T.<a name=228:11></a> She is very much like the christian in a human system, having a regard for Christ, but secretly despising those who honour Him.<a name=228:12></a> David was honouring Him here: "And David was clothed with a robe of byssus, and all the Levites that bore the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah chief of the music of the singers; and David had upon him a linen ephod.<a name=228:13></a> And all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah with shouting, and with sound of the trumpet, and with clarions, and with cymbals, playing aloud with lutes and harps.<a name=228:14></a> And it came to pass as the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked through a window, and saw king David dancing and playing; and she despised him in her heart".<a name=228:15></a> That corresponds to a certain attitude today.<a name=228:16></a>

		J.T.<a name=256:1></a> It is in mind to refer again to chapter 22, but before doing so it might be remarked that this section -- chapters 23 to 27 inclusive -- contemplates Solomon on the throne; that is, David and Solomon reigning together; they also contemplate the ordering of the kingdom on the principle of <i>twenty-four</i>.<a name=256:2></a> Every department in the kingdom was thus ordered and provided for, down even to the matter of field products, vineyards, trees; also cattle -- what is called "the substance which was king David's" (chapter 27:31).<a name=256:3></a> In the previous section we have the <i>light</i> of sonship.<a name=256:4></a> Solomon was not yet born when Nathan's message was delivered; the events connected with his birth are not recorded in this book, but according to 2 Samuel, the birth took place in the period covered in that section, and in chapter 22 he is alluded to as "young and tender", but not yet on the throne.<a name=256:5></a> So that the instruction in those chapters, in chapter 22 particularly, contemplates Solomon on the scene, young and tender, and coming under David's instruction.<a name=256:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is to be noted that chapter 22 begins with the definite statement of David as to the house: "This is the house of Jehovah Elohim, and this is the altar of burnt-offering for Israel".<a name=256:7></a> It is a definite end reached in his soul, God having answered him on the ground of sacrifice, and taking account of him as reaching a certain point in his soul through discipline.<a name=256:8></a> So that the house comes into view on moral lines, and what follows in chapter 22 shows that David would have it secure.<a name=256:9></a> The pattern of the house came in later, on a more spiritual plane; for it is not on the moral line, but on the spiritual line he received the pattern; it was "by the Spirit" (chapter 28:12).<a name=256:10></a>

		It is thought well to ponder chapter 22 a little on the moral line -- how things are to be held, and how sonship is to be recognised; exercises reaching on to sonship fully presented: the state in which things are to be before God.<a name=257:1></a> Solomon represents that the governing principle now is to be sonship, already present, already expressed.<a name=257:2></a> Our brother had something in his mind, held in abeyance, from our previous reading; perhaps he will express it.<a name=257:3></a>

		J.T.<a name=257:6></a> I think it would be a very practical help in view of the many coming in now, younger men able to minister, that it should be made clear that they come into wealth.<a name=257:7></a> David says: "Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be built for Jehovah must be exceeding great in fame and in beauty in all lands: I will therefore make preparation for it".<a name=257:8></a> Then he called for Solomon and said: "As for me, my son, I was minded to build a house unto the name of Jehovah my God.<a name=257:9></a> But the word of Jehovah came to me saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build a house unto my name, for thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight" (verses 7,8).<a name=257:10></a> So David is thoroughly self-judged, having accepted the message from Nathan; correspondingly, he would have judged his military course; for that had turned out to be a hindrance to some extent in regard of the house.<a name=257:11></a> Great and successful as he was in military exploits, it has turned out to be a hindrance to his entrance on greater things.<a name=257:12></a> That is an important thing for those of us who are older, to review our lives, as to whether our service has in any way hindered us, whether we have been unable through it to enter on the more spiritual things; the full spiritual plane that God has in mind for us.<a name=257:13></a>

		Then he proceeds to speak further to Solomon: "Now, my son, Jehovah be with thee, that thou mayest prosper, and build the house of Jehovah thy God, as he has said of thee" (verse 11).<a name=258:1></a> Then: "And behold, in my affliction I have prepared for the house of Jehovah a hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight, for it is in abundance; and timber and stone have I prepared; and thou shalt add to it.<a name=258:2></a> And there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of skilful men for every kind of work.<a name=258:3></a> Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no number.<a name=258:4></a> Arise and be doing and Jehovah be with thee" (verses 14 - 16).<a name=258:5></a> I thought it would be worth noticing the wealth with which Solomon begins, and also whether there is not a corresponding condition now come down to us from the afflictions of others; wealth particularly which those who are coming on share in; they have therefore an immense advantage, but they are to "add to it".<a name=258:6></a> They are not simply to keep on in that into which they have come, but to add, each one, something of his own, to what is already accumulated.<a name=258:7></a> The number of younger men that are now active gives rise to inquiry as to whether the Lord is continuing on, or whether He is finishing up, completing the dispensation, but in either case, He would have those who are now coming on to be in freshness, and each to add to what there has been.<a name=258:8></a>

		J.T.<a name=296:1></a> In order to estimate aright the spiritual instruction seen in chapters 2 to 5 of this book, it may be well to observe that chapter 1 seems to be below their level.<a name=296:2></a> Solomon is not presented as beginning on the level of the closing chapters of the first book.<a name=296:3></a> We are told that "Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to all the princes of all Israel, the chief fathers; and Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place at Gibeon; for there was God's tent of meeting which Moses the servant of Jehovah had made in the wilderness" (verses 2,3).<a name=296:4></a> He comes back after a great public occasion (verse 13), "from the high place at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tent of meeting, and reigned over Israel".<a name=296:5></a> The following verses scarcely comport with the high ground taken, the high ground on which he began, for it is said: "And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen; and he had a thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen; and he placed them in the chariot-cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.<a name=296:6></a> And the king made silver and gold in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he as the sycamores that are in the lowland for abundance" (verses 14,15); and it goes on to speak of the exportation of horses from Egypt.<a name=296:7></a>

		Now a comparison between this chapter and the corresponding chapters in 1 Kings shows that in the latter book, Solomon, after the appearance of Jehovah to him in a dream, returned to Jerusalem and went before the <i>ark</i>; and instead of this description of horses and chariots and the depreciation of silver and gold, we have in Kings, Solomon's wisdom in the case of the two women.<a name=296:8></a> So that Kings seems to indicate that he is maintaining the level on which he began, whereas Chronicles indicates a drop.<a name=296:9></a> But then this is

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish to speak about secret service.<a name=333:1></a> It is a department in God's kingdom, as it is in man's, but, in using the phrase "secret service", I would at once make clear, that in no sense is it to operate against the powers that be.<a name=333:2></a> They, indeed, are part of it; they are ordained of God, and they have a peculiar place in His testimony that believers should understand, and especially so now.<a name=333:3></a> The book of Daniel opens up their service to us, God causing the first of what are now called the powers that be, to see in a vision what the great matter signified.<a name=333:4></a> Nebuchadnezzar was already ruling, and before he was taken on, his father had ruled, but the vision disclosed to him, through Daniel's interpretation of it, that he was the head of gold.<a name=333:5></a> That image of gold and silver and brass and iron was not a satanic device, nor were the empires indicated in it to be at Satan's behest; they were to be God's servants.<a name=333:6></a> The prophet Zechariah tells us that they were the four spirits of the heavens which stood before the God of the earth, and Nebuchadnezzar is divinely called Jehovah's servant.<a name=333:7></a> He was the head of gold, but all the others were integrally parts of the system indicated in the image, right down to this moment.<a name=333:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In speaking of secret service, therefore, there is not the slightest suggestion of any hostility to these powers.<a name=333:9></a> In His wisdom God saw the necessity for universal government, and it was with a view to the bringing in of Christ.<a name=333:10></a> He came in under the last of those monarchies which continue till now.<a name=333:11></a> He recognised that the head of it had power from God, and Pilate, as representative of that power, was true, abstractly at least, to the responsibility resting upon him.<a name=333:12></a> He primarily had no thought of putting Jesus to death; his great thought was to liberate Him.<a name=333:13></a> Only his natural susceptibilities
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		as a poor, mortal, sinful man, made way for the devil, and of course, that has been repeated times without number in the history of government, so that, whilst men in authority are abstractly right -- for government is of God -- their natural propensities give way to the enemy.<a name=334:1></a> Still, government is government, and governors are governors, and Pilate was the governor.<a name=334:2></a> He is distinctively called the governor in Matthew, and owned as such, his wife sending a message to him to have nothing to do with that righteous Man.<a name=334:3></a> Both he and his wife were, as it were, abstractly right, but he was the weak one, and gave way.<a name=334:4></a> But still there was the testimony which must be accredited to the governor that Jesus was righteous and undeserving of death.<a name=334:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have no thought in any way of militating against that principle, but rather of supporting it, for it is of God.<a name=334:6></a> Those monarchies are of God in themselves and He had His testimony in mind in forming them, and we should not be here today save for the protection that they extend.<a name=334:7></a> The mystery of iniquity works over against them, and the Spirit goes on to say that there is He which hinders that spirit of iniquity, and that which hinders.<a name=334:8></a> It is for us as spiritual to discern what is alluded to in <i>Him</i> who restrains and <i>that</i> which restrains, and to have respect for every element that restrains, in whatever measure the mystery of iniquity works.<a name=334:9></a> It is working; Satan is behind it.<a name=334:10></a> Nebuchadnezzar, as I said, was not taken up for that.<a name=334:11></a> He may have served it, as indeed all the monarchies, but the thing itself represented in that image is of God.<a name=334:12></a> It is over against what is of the devil.<a name=334:13></a> The four spirits of the heavens which stand before God, refer to government according to God.<a name=334:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I say all that because I know the difficulty of detaching from the abstract thought, what comes out in those who may be governing, because of what they are, poor mortal men.<a name=334:15></a> Save as they are supported of God, and that is surely through our prayers, they are

	<div class="paragraph">
		amenable to evil influence.<a name=335:1></a> That has to be owned.<a name=335:2></a> Pilate is the best example you can get of a man in authority, knowing what was right, and yet weakly surrendering his responsibility to the clamour of irresponsible persons, for that was the fact.<a name=335:3></a> He would not have put Jesus to death otherwise.<a name=335:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In view of all that, I would address the young ones here as to secrecy, and the Lord sets it out in that way in telling us to enter our closets and pray to our Father who sees what is in secret.<a name=335:5></a> The Scriptures abound indeed with the thought of secrecy that is of God.<a name=335:6></a> There is secrecy, of course, which is of the devil, and we are all prone to unholy secrecy.<a name=335:7></a> But there is secrecy that is of God, and no one shall shine in the assembly, nor be adorned in the testimony save as he has recourse to his closet and prays to his Father in secret, and his Father who sees in secret will answer him suitably.<a name=335:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This leads me on to the passage in Samuel.<a name=335:9></a> It is a secret system, a secret service, not in one person only, but in five, and subsequently in seven, with the result that Absalom's rebellion and kingdom were overthrown irretrievably.<a name=335:10></a> Absalom's governorship was not of God; it had no title to be of God.<a name=335:11></a> It was rebellion against David, who was appointed and anointed of God, and the verses read present a secret system against what was characteristically anti-christian.<a name=335:12></a> That is the thing, dear brethren, to have a clear view as to government ordained of God and to be able to distinguish it from satanic workings with a view to apostasy.<a name=335:13></a> It is that that calls forth the necessity for this secret service of which I am speaking.<a name=335:14></a> It begins in the closet, and I might say the extension of it is the holiest, where we see the means which God has to overthrow all that is contrary to Him.<a name=335:15></a> We may not see that in our closet, but confidence in God will assure us, as He hears in secret, that what we suffer from here as against God and Christ will be overthrown, and we as taking it on in prayer will be rewarded.<a name=335:16></a> We need not be in a hurry
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=336>[Page 336]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		for any rewards.<a name=336:1></a> They will all come, and perhaps at a time when we shall value them and they will not damage us.<a name=336:2></a> Were the "exceeding weight of glory" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:17">2 Corinthians  4:17</a>) that awaits us to be placed on our brows today, it might be too much for us.<a name=336:3></a> There will be plenty of that -- an "exceeding weight of glory".<a name=336:4></a> Let us be patient in the secret service of God pending the manifestation of that.<a name=336:5></a> It will be more than abundant.<a name=336:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We thus begin firstly with confidence in God the Father in secret, and secondly the holiest, where we see how He has the means of dealing with everything, as Asaph says in his well-known <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#73">Psalm  73</a>.<a name=336:7></a> He was greatly disturbed by the wicked -- not the rulers, not the powers that be.<a name=336:8></a> The previous psalm tells us of Solomon, and the prayers of David were ended.<a name=336:9></a> All that was necessary to the government of God was established in Solomon, but Asaph was speaking about the wicked.<a name=336:10></a> They flourished like a green bay tree, and he was distressed as to it, "until", he says, "I went into the sanctuaries of God, then understood I their end".<a name=336:11></a> It is the sanctuaries -- not one but two, and inside involves the mystery of God.<a name=336:12></a> Over against the "mystery of iniquity" is "the mystery of God; in which are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:3">Colossians  2:3</a>); and we ourselves are hidden in that sense; "your life is hid with the Christ in God" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3:3">Colossians  3:3</a>).<a name=336:13></a> So we are to carry on on these lines, content with obscurity and reproach, for that is the order of the day, but with the sure end in mind: "Until I went into the sanctuaries of God; then understood I their end".<a name=336:14></a> I cease then to be anxious about them.<a name=336:15></a> Still they have to be contended with.<a name=336:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the first point I would make in the scripture read in Samuel is that the secret system is vested in a friend of David, a rare title, but in principle a friend of God -- Hushai.<a name=336:17></a> Abraham was the friend of God, and the Lord Jesus said, "Ye are my friends", that is, those who are trustworthy, to whom He can impart secrets,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=337>[Page 337]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		to whom He can make known His mind, in whom He can confide.<a name=337:1></a> So it is that Hushai is David's friend, and he is to be the president of that secret system.<a name=337:2></a> It is a question of loyalty, and proved loyalty to the rejected king.<a name=337:3></a> Hushai is not only the friend of David; he is a wise man, but it is the kind of wisdom that men would call foolishness.<a name=337:4></a> That is reproach.<a name=337:5></a> To act in what seems to be foolishness is reproach, and yet "the foolishness of God is wiser than men", as the scripture says (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:25">1 Corinthians  1:25</a>).<a name=337:6></a> Hushai represents that foolishness, but his advice was intended to overthrow the counsel of Ahithophel.<a name=337:7></a> He who at one time was David's counsellor was now on the side of the enemy.<a name=337:8></a> How sorrowful!<a name=337:9></a> May God save us from such a state of soul.<a name=337:10></a> The moment demands loyalty to Christ.<a name=337:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		David chose his man rightly.<a name=337:12></a> He was worshipping at the time -- very significant, very portentous of good results; and God is now calling our attention to worship.<a name=337:13></a> It is as worshippers that we are safe and know what to do, because worshippers of God have access to God and participate in His mind and feelings as drawing near.<a name=337:14></a> So David in effect says to Hushai, You will serve me better by going back into the city.<a name=337:15></a> David had already sent the ark back; he was no partisan; he was a man of God, hence he sent the ark back, the foundation of everything, and with it, a remarkable combination; the two priests, Zadok and Abiathar, and their two sons Ahimaaz and Jonathan, and then Hushai his friend; five persons against a powerful rival to David, a powerful rebel to him who was typical of Christ.<a name=337:16></a> This is no question of the powers that be, as we speak today, but of a positive anti-christian power, and there is to be no relenting at all in opposition to that, in whomsoever it may be.<a name=337:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So Hushai and Absalom come into Jerusalem together -- Hushai, David's friend, and Absalom, David's enemy.<a name=337:18></a> That is where the issue lies, and to a spiritual understanding there can be only one end, and that is
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=338>[Page 338]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the overthrow of Absalom.<a name=338:1></a> Two other persons are added to the system, making seven in all, and I speak of them now for the sake of the young people here.<a name=338:2></a> One of them is just called a maid, or a wench in the Authorised Version, a word scarcely ever used now.<a name=338:3></a> She was just a maid, but she becomes a powerful link in this chain of secret service.<a name=338:4></a> The two young men were at En-rogel, and the message came conveying what Hushai had counselled and what Ahithophel had counselled.<a name=338:5></a> It was urgent that David should get the facts, and this maid carried the tidings to those two young men loyally waiting to serve David and David's interests.<a name=338:6></a> It was a most auspicious situation, typical of our own times in the most striking way, for God is working with the young men and young women loyal to Christ, linked on with older ones, older men and women, all moving together in secret understanding, not disloyal to the powers that be, but loyal to them, praying for them, for they are part of the secret system of God, and essential to it.<a name=338:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus the news is carried to those two young men and they with haste proceed to deliver it to David; but they are seen by the enemy, by an agent of his, another young man.<a name=338:8></a> There are plenty of those, alas!<a name=338:9></a> David's young men are tracked by Absalom's emissaries to Bahurim, to the house of a man there.<a name=338:10></a> He is not active, but his wife is.<a name=338:11></a> You see how extensive the thought is; our houses and families and other things must enter into the secret service of God.<a name=338:12></a> In the household the service can be carried on most effectively by the parents, particularly the mothers, in keeping the children's minds pure, rebuking the evil which they imbibe in the schools, or elsewhere.<a name=338:13></a> It is all a question of the secret service, of the interests of our absent Lord, and loyalty to Him.<a name=338:14></a> The children are baptised to His name, and brought up in His name to be used of Him in due course, as these young men here, the sons of priests.<a name=338:15></a> What is needed in the households is that very thing,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, finally, there is the passage in 2 Kings.<a name=339:3></a> I have been speaking of priests, and all true christians are priests, at least on the divine side, and should be practically, that is, as in their houses, so that we are alive to Christ's interests and nothing is admitted that is unsuitable to those interests.<a name=339:4></a> Now we have a man who is called a man of God.<a name=339:5></a> That is another matter.<a name=339:6></a> Elisha is not even named at first.<a name=339:7></a> It is a remarkable passage, referring to a man who could tell what the king of Syria said in his bedchamber.<a name=339:8></a> You might say I am speaking of things entirely unknown now, but we should not be altogether sure about that, for as having the Spirit of God we surely should know something, as Paul says, of the enemy's devices.<a name=339:9></a> "We are not ignorant", he says, "of <i>his</i> devices" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#2:11">2 Corinthians  2:11</a>).<a name=339:10></a> The more spiritual we are, the more we shall discern his devices, and understanding his devices we know how to battle with him effectively.<a name=339:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the king of Syria would make war.<a name=339:12></a> It is remarkable how prone the natural man is to make war.<a name=339:13></a> "The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart", we are told (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#55:21">Psalm  55:21</a>).<a name=339:14></a> It is in the natural man actuated by the devil.<a name=339:15></a> War is one of the leading thoughts in man's heart.<a name=339:16></a> If he has any power at all, it is the opportunity to show it, and war is in his heart.<a name=339:17></a> If he has to do with the people of God in any way, war is in his heart.<a name=339:18></a> So the king of Syria says, "In such and such a place shall be my camp", and the man of God knew.<a name=339:19></a> I am speaking now of the man of God -- what a great thought it is!<a name=339:20></a> -- to enlist interest in it and desire to be in it, for it is near to us, it is within our grasp.<a name=339:21></a> It is only <i>applied</i> to Timotheus, as a young man, in the New Testament; indeed, it is scarcely used,

	<div class="paragraph">
		and yet there were thousands, as I might say, of men of God in the early christian days; all the apostles and many others of whom we have no record.<a name=340:1></a> Yet if Timotheus was one, a young man, why not any young man today?<a name=340:2></a> That is the bearing of it.<a name=340:3></a> "But <i>thou</i>, O man of God, flee these things" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#6:11">1 Timothy  6:11</a>).<a name=340:4></a> A young man called a man of God.<a name=340:5></a> What an honour!<a name=340:6></a> Could one have a greater title in a sense than that?<a name=340:7></a> It is a moral thought that one is a man of God.<a name=340:8></a> He is thinking for God, and for the people of God; he is thinking for every interest of God on earth.<a name=340:9></a> So if the people of God are to be attacked by any one, whosoever it may be and for whatever reason, he is on the alert; he considers the matter in prayer, and with discernment.<a name=340:10></a> So Elisha, the man of God, says to the leading men among the people of God, that the king of Syria is to encamp at such and such a place.<a name=340:11></a> What an advantage!<a name=340:12></a> What hope was there for the king of Syria to overcome the people of God?<a name=340:13></a> There was no hope at all with a man of God brought into the matter.<a name=340:14></a>

		So the king of Syria wonders.<a name=341:1></a> It looked as if there were traitors in his camp, but, as usual, there is someone who knows, even in the enemy's camp, and he tells him simply and directly that it is Elisha the prophet who is in Israel.<a name=341:2></a> That is the man.<a name=341:3></a> He must have heard of him, but he now knows, and the sequel in the chapter shows how the attack is made on the man of God.<a name=341:4></a> I speak now only of the secret service, that the man of God knew of the enemy's movements.<a name=341:5></a> It is not the priest, but a man of God and a prophet, and he frustrates the great Syrian power so that it can do nothing against the people of God.<a name=341:6></a> Let us be simple about this, dear brethren, and use Elisha's weapons of war, especially prayer.<a name=341:7></a> Much more, of course, goes with the prophet, with the man of God; he is a man that flees youthful lusts and follows righteousness, piety, faith, love, and other things that are of God.<a name=341:8></a> He is the man that God will use effectively against every attack on His people.<a name=341:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So the young man saw the mountain full of horses and chariots.<a name=342:9></a> What could Syria do against them?<a name=342:10></a> What could it do against Elisha?<a name=342:11></a> Elisha says again to Jehovah, "Smite this nation, I pray thee, with blindness", and He did.<a name=342:12></a> Then Elisha, the man of God, becomes the leader, and he led the whole army into Samaria, into the very city that they would regard as their enemy, where they could have been overthrown and destroyed.<a name=342:13></a> The king of Israel wanted to do it, but Elisha says, No.<a name=342:14></a> It is now a question of the dispensation of grace in principle, for Elisha represents that.<a name=342:15></a> We have Christ in resurrection and ascension in Elijah, and the counterpart of that down here in Elisha.<a name=342:16></a> That is our position, and we do not want to have this wonderful dispensation of grace beclouded in any way.<a name=342:17></a> So we have the gospel that very day in Samaria.<a name=342:18></a> The man the Syrians sought is their leader, and he asks God to open their eyes, and He does, and the man of God directs the king of Israel to give them bread and water.<a name=342:19></a> It is an act of pure grace.<a name=342:20></a>

		Thus the position is maintained, because Christ as on the Father's throne is still active and will be active, and He would call us into this secret service in the exercise of prayer, and all that goes with the man of God.<a name=343:1></a> He would call us into service as qualified and we need not fear.<a name=343:2></a> Fear God, of course, but not the enemy.<a name=343:3></a> God will stand by, and so the dispensation will go on, the gospel will continue to be preached, the ministry of the assembly will continue, and the elect will be saved.<a name=343:4></a> The whole matter will finish according to God.<a name=343:5></a> May God bless the word.<a name=343:6></a>

		I intend to speak of glory, wishing to show that it is in the mind of God that we should enter into it at the present time.<a name=344:1></a> We read of the departing glory (<a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#11:23">Ezekiel  11:23</a>), and the returning glory (<a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#43:1">Ezekiel  43:1</a> - 5); one calling forth sadness and the other joy.<a name=344:2></a> In a public sense the glory has departed from christendom, but through individual faithfulness, as I hope to show, it may still be seen here below.<a name=344:3></a> The incoming of the Spirit involved glory.<a name=344:4></a> We are told that He appeared to the saints as cloven tongues, as of fire, and sat upon each of them.<a name=344:5></a> He had found a resting place.<a name=344:6></a> The effect of it was felt by those present in Jerusalem from the subdivisions of the empire of that day.<a name=344:7></a> The incoming of the divine glory found a resting place suitable to itself, but on its own terms -- that is, it appeared in the character of cloven tongues as of <i>fire</i>.<a name=344:8></a> The will of the flesh would be drastically disallowed.<a name=344:9></a> There was no such suggestion implied as the Spirit came on Jesus: He abode in the form of a dove on Jesus; but at Pentecost there were terms implied, for the glory carried with it the means of its own protection, so that it should not be desecrated; the tongues were there, but also the fire.<a name=344:10></a> The public body has moved from the divine foundation and hence the glory has retired.<a name=344:11></a> But this passage in Peter indicates how there may be a return; indeed the glory will always be seen where there is the acceptance of the reproach of Christ.<a name=344:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So Peter, who had part in the incoming of which I have been speaking, says much about glory, and in the verse I read he links it on with reproach <i>in</i> the name of Christ; its presence here is ensured by the acceptance of the reproach of Christ.<a name=344:13></a> It is "in the name", denoting a state in those who are under reproach, not <i>for</i> the name, but <i>in</i> the name, as it should read.<a name=344:14></a> Many are

		facing this matter in a peculiar way, and as love is working we are <i>all</i> facing it with them -- reproach in the name of Christ.<a name=345:1></a> "In the name" refers to the state of those who are under reproach, a state calling out reproach, involving a glory as the passage goes on to say, "the Spirit of glory and the Spirit of God", as I believe it should read.<a name=345:2></a> That is, there are two thoughts, the Spirit of glory, and the Spirit of God.<a name=345:3></a> It is no partial matter; it is a complete thought as regards a resting place for the glory, for that is the word used, "the Spirit of glory and the Spirit of God rests upon you".<a name=345:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I mention all that so as to link up my remarks with Exodus, for this agrees with what Exodus sets out, and I wish to confine my thoughts in the main to the glory as seen in that book.<a name=345:5></a> Peter links with Exodus in his ministry in these two epistles, writing "to the sojourners of the dispersion" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:1">1 Peter  1:1</a>), believing Jews, sojourning in those provinces in the west; he implies that they are there under the government of God; they are not in Canaan any more; externally they are of the dispersion.<a name=345:6></a> Whoever might have been the instrument of it, they were suffering under the government of God and Peter has in mind to show that, in the acceptance of the reproach that God may allow in His government, the testimony of Exodus reappears, and there is a resting place for the glory of God.<a name=345:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You can see therefore, dear brethren, how this is within the range of every christian, how he or she may become a resting place for the glory; and as I said, the word reproach links on significantly with Exodus; one may say that it is the foundation of the glory that so shines in the typical teaching of that book.<a name=345:8></a> It is the book in which Moses shines peculiarly in this sense.<a name=345:9></a> The thought of God is that the ministry is to be enhanced by the minister, and He had in mind that the ministry He was about to place in the hands of this great minister was to be enhanced by him.<a name=345:10></a> The Spirit

		Now I am sure we are all interested in these suggestions.<a name=346:11></a> No one of us should elect himself out of this matter, for it is within his reach.<a name=346:12></a> The reproach attached not only to Moses; it was there before he accepted it; however many of us have accepted it, it was there before, thank God!<a name=346:13></a> It lay in the people of God as they were at that time, down-trodden slaves in Egypt reproachfully termed "Hebrews"; the reproach was there and Moses accepted it.<a name=346:14></a> It has been here all the time, rarely accepted; but wherever accepted the glory is present.<a name=346:15></a> Moses found it in Egypt and in accepting it he became glorious morally, never more glorious in his earlier history than when he went out

		My subject is <i>food</i>, food, as indicated in these scriptures, provided seasonally, covering the whole year; and when I say "the whole year", I have in mind "the acceptable year of the Lord" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4:19">Luke  4:19</a>), that is, this dispensation in which we are.<a name=357:1></a> It is about to end, but still, perhaps, a month or so remaining: at least, it has not yet expired, and hence the need of food.<a name=357:2></a> It is the acceptable year of the Lord, a year of unequalled importance, all the best fruits of the previous ones (or dispensations) coming into it.<a name=357:3></a> The psalmist says to God, "Thou crownest the year with thy goodness" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#65:11">Psalm  65:11</a>).<a name=357:4></a> It would appear, indeed, that the psalmist had in mind that the whole year would be full of goodness, but would be crowned.<a name=357:5></a> That is, if we may read it thus, as is said, "Thou crownest the year <i>of</i> thy goodness", without specifying what the crown is.<a name=357:6></a> If, on the other hand, it be as in the ordinary translation, that He crowns it <i>with</i> His goodness we are to expect now a signal evidence of divine goodness in this period of the year, this wonderful year of grace.<a name=357:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So that we may understand the use of the word "year" in this connection; the Lord, in referring to <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#61">Isaiah  61</a>, undoubtedly confirms that this dispensation is so regarded divinely in His saying, "to preach the acceptable year of the Lord".<a name=357:8></a> The year is the longest period of measured time, and with God, a year in itself is brief, for a thousand of them are said to be as one day with Him; on the other hand, one day is with Him as one thousand years (<a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#3:8">2 Peter  3:8</a>).<a name=357:9></a> We must therefore learn to let God speak of things from His own point of view.<a name=357:10></a> He is pleased to speak of them from ours, for, in grace, He comes down to our side in instructing us; but the more we progress in the school of God the more we shall take His point of view.<a name=357:11></a> He begins indeed with a

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As I said, we have to understand what He has in mind.<a name=358:6></a> The year is spoken of in various ways in Scripture.<a name=358:7></a> We have the solar year, which may be regarded as the longest, regulated by the great lights in the heavens, by the sun and even by the moon.<a name=358:8></a> That is the first kind of year, and God committed Himself to that after the deluge.<a name=358:9></a> He reverts to it, and says it is to continue, but in measure of seed-time and harvest, cold and heat, etc.<a name=358:10></a> (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#8:22">Genesis  8:22</a>).<a name=358:11></a> Seed-time is the first mentioned, and then harvest; corresponding with that we have later, the idea of a year reckoned according to its crops.<a name=358:12></a> God, as it were, passing over all the doings of man and reckoning the year according to its crop for Him, for in truth that is what the year is for, to bring out something for God.<a name=358:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then again, He is pleased to regard the year, in a spiritual sense, as affording Him special opportunities with His people -- the holy convocations covering seven months of the year.<a name=358:14></a> God reckons the year thus, and insists upon it too, that, in our calculations in the solar year, we must not forget what is due to God in our holy convocations.<a name=358:15></a> They are necessarily limited, for we cannot spend all our time together; but God certainly asserts His right to some of it, and to our best in these comings together.<a name=358:16></a> "All the males in Israel" is what God looks for.<a name=358:17></a> The principle in this reference

		to the males is that there is the intelligent side, in which, of course, sisters share with the brothers.<a name=359:1></a> It is a question of our state.<a name=359:2></a> In the provision in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#16">Deuteronomy  16</a>, God has in mind what we may call special selections of persons; He is entitled to the best at any time, and He would say, I would like to have the year filled out with these occasions, taking full account of our limitations.<a name=359:3></a> He makes special provision for our affairs at home, whilst attending these holy convocations.<a name=359:4></a> They are for God; for us, of course, too.<a name=359:5></a> He reduces the convocations to three in Deuteronomy, although Leviticus provides for seven.<a name=359:6></a> God graciously accommodates Himself to us, as much as to intimate: I value these holy convocations, and if I cannot have seven, I want three, and it is a question of the males.<a name=359:7></a> God would say, That is a year, too.<a name=359:8></a> What one might call, not an agricultural year, though it is well-nigh commensurate with it, but a spiritual year.<a name=359:9></a> The agricultural year is a question of crops which would necessarily end before the last month.<a name=359:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, I am defining the idea of the year briefly in that way so that we may all understand God's mind as to these occasions, and fill out His year, as He would have us do.<a name=359:11></a> From the gospel point of view, He would use up every month of the year; He would have it preached "in season and out of season" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#4:2">2 Timothy  4:2</a>).<a name=359:12></a> The year is for a purpose, and has been extended, in a metaphorical sense, to the great "acceptable year of the Lord".<a name=359:13></a> We can see how much enters into it, and how it is to be sustained on the principle of twelve, that is, the twelve months of the ordinary year; so that we come now to this seasonal provision which He has described.<a name=359:14></a> It involves cultivation of the land, not now only on God's account, but also on ours, and so, as I said, referring to the psalm, we see how He makes it possible for cultivation to result in what is needed.<a name=359:15></a> The potential qualities of the earth make it possible, for the potential possibilities are creative; God has placed them there,

		but then, not only has He placed them there, He also furnishes the rain to water the earth in its season: that is what the psalm says.<a name=360:1></a> I refer to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#65">Psalm  65</a>.<a name=360:2></a> God is wonderfully bountiful in His creation.<a name=360:3></a> What I.<a name=360:4></a> am saying implies that God, in creating, provided for the administrative side; that is, that the "fulness" of what He created should be developed, including cultivation, so that suitable food should come round seasonally.<a name=360:5></a> God makes it possible, not only in what He has placed in the earth in creating it, but in the furnishing of rain, and rivers, so that there is plenty of water.<a name=360:6></a> It says indeed, in the psalm referred to, "the river of God .<a name=360:7></a>.<a name=360:8></a>.<a name=360:9></a> is full of water", but the river is not the only means that God has of watering; rain comes from the clouds in a more effective way, but the river seems to be a sort of reservoir that God can use too.<a name=360:10></a> In some parts of the earth, there is no rain, but there are rivers.<a name=360:11></a> It is God's wonderful bounty, so that, in cultivation, there should be seasonal food for men, hence no one should starve.<a name=360:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Numbers fits into this position; and Numbers in the types is the book of movement, regulated by divine commandment.<a name=382:7></a> This commandment implies a preference, for God reserves this right.<a name=382:8></a> Hence Judah has the first place in this movement, not Reuben.<a name=382:9></a> The book is therefore stamped in this way: it is "in the wilderness", and as in the wilderness we are with the God with whom we have to do.<a name=382:10></a> Whatever character He may take, He is "our God", even though it be in the severest discipline, we say, "Our God is a consuming fire" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:29">Hebrews  12:29</a>); we rest in that knowledge.<a name=382:11></a> Where fire is essential, where fire prevents disaster, we welcome it, and especially in our God.<a name=382:12></a> So He reserves the right of selection; and those who love Him will never quarrel with that, for they say, Love will do its best!<a name=382:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This thought of love enters into the tenth chapter peculiarly, not only love in God, but love in the saints; for it would seem that God would have it so; as if, when movement should begin, He would say, It must not be simply the outcome of direct commandment, but also of love.<a name=382:14></a> Hence, although according to chapter 9 everything was ready for movement, chapter 10 brings in, not simply authority, but <i>the rights of love</i>, namely, the silver trumpets.<a name=382:15></a> It is as if God were to say: The people are all ready for the march, but they need this last touch!<a name=382:16></a> It is ever so; the touch of love, though it be the first one, it must also be the last.<a name=382:17></a> We are to

		walk in love, to serve in love -- love at the beginning, and at the end, and all the time.<a name=383:1></a> On God's side it is always so, and if He has His way with us, it is so on our side, too; as the Lord says, "By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have love amongst yourselves" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#13:35">John  13:35</a>).<a name=383:2></a> It is a question of a community, as indeed marked christians at the very outset; the Spirit of God loves to portray it, as He does in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>.<a name=383:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These silver trumpets are to be used not only for marching, but for other things, to stamp the whole position with the rights of love, as over against what marks man -- the rights of the sword, the rights of the navy, the army, and of the aircraft.<a name=383:4></a> The whole position in christianity is stamped with the rights of love: whenever we come together, whether for a meeting for care, for prayer, or for ministry, or as in assembly, these rights must always mark us.<a name=383:5></a> It makes the position correspond with heaven, so as to be a reflex of what is there; and, really, nothing less than this will do for God.<a name=383:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the blast of the trumpets is to bring out the marching spirit, the moving forward.<a name=383:7></a> Although there is the principle of divine preference and ordering, we are to move together; but the silver trumpets denote the rights of love; and the next question is whether those who do march are corresponding.<a name=383:8></a> Hence, as seen in the first verses I read, the first blast is for the camp of Judah, though Judah is not mentioned: it is "the camps that lie eastward".<a name=383:9></a> God is saying to us, You are to move as in correspondence with love in Me according to all its provisions; and it is perfect love.<a name=383:10></a> Love on God's side and on Christ's is perfect love; it casts out fear.<a name=383:11></a> The blast of alarm need not cause alarm in regard of God: He is love; thus we are not to be afraid in conflict.<a name=383:12></a> Much is said of that throughout the Scriptures.<a name=383:13></a> Joshua was assured, as the man with the drawn sword said to him, "No; for as captain of the army of Jehovah am I <i>now</i> come" (<a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#5:14">Joshua  5:14</a>) -- at the time

		So the first blast is to bring out this movement of hope.<a name=384:15></a> The second blast is to bring out the movement of those toward the south.<a name=384:16></a> The trumpet blast is referred to in connection with these two camps only; for the one is full of hope, and the other is restfulness in privilege, in favour.<a name=384:17></a> The south suggests favourableness.<a name=384:18></a> The chapter contemplates that all are to move, for the camps of Ephraim and Dan are mentioned later; but those on the east and on the south only are affected by the trumpet blasts.<a name=384:19></a> It is, as I said, as if God would have us move in hope.<a name=384:20></a> Paul is full of this; he speaks of "the God of hope" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#15:13">Romans  15:13</a>).<a name=384:21></a> He would instil hope into our souls, in view of the dark gloom around, dispelling fear from our hearts.<a name=384:22></a> Thus we must not fail to move as under divine direction; it is a question of the rights of God's love.<a name=384:23></a>

		I must go on to the verses in Philippians.<a name=387:5></a> We need the so-called "New Translation" to help us.<a name=387:6></a> It would not be out of place to say that this "New Translation", so called, is a provision of God, enabling us, in dealing with what the Scriptures present, to stand on our feet with assurance, so that renderings of the original may not give way under our feet, that thus we have the mind of God in the text.<a name=387:7></a> The Spirit of God is ready to enable us to make use of it.<a name=387:8></a> The apostle in <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3">Philippians  3</a>is speaking of himself and his movement, in the light of the land of Canaan, the land of promise, in order to reach that.<a name=387:9></a> The movements of the tabernacle in the wilderness, and of the Israelites' camps, were not merely to reach the land of promise; that was in view, of course; but there was testimony from God's point of view in every stage of the journey.<a name=387:10></a> That is not what the apostle had in mind here.<a name=387:11></a> He is leading the way for us in heavenly exercises, with a heavenly objective, but already in mind laying hold of it.<a name=387:12></a> He had to say he had not yet obtained the prize, but he steadily pursued, as one in a race, with the goal in view.<a name=387:13></a> He must have had great enjoyment, though great exercise also, in this matter, for the Holy Spirit would be with him in his exercises and in his prayers.<a name=387:14></a> So the reading is, in the New Translation: "Not that I have already

		Then, in order to give the truth a practical bearing for every one of us in regard of our position here below, chapter 4 furnishes us with another set of things -- not a goal, not a prize, but, as generally in the creation of God, a great balancing principle.<a name=388:16></a> One has been looking over the nations, and one has ventured to regard some of them as balancing nations, taken up of

	<div class="paragraph">

		J.T.<a name=405:4></a> Well, the word father-in-law is the prominent word as to Jethro; there is something in what you say, and we should therefore consider the history of Moses up to this point.<a name=405:5></a> I think he had learned subjection before he met Jethro, at least in the sense that he sat by a well; he had been a man reliant on his own ability, but now he typically recognises that the well is a source outside of himself, but which, in type, would be inside of himself, that is the Spirit.<a name=405:6></a> I think your suggestion is good, because his continuance with Jethro denoted that he was already subject, and was content to dwell with the man, as it says.<a name=405:7></a> The experience of forty years in such circumstances, however, must have greatly augmented the idea of subjection in his soul, for he dwelt with the father-in-law, but it was "in law", and such authority has peculiar force, which is sometimes irksome.<a name=405:8></a>

		J.T.<a name=423:1></a> It is in mind to compare a little the beginnings of these two gospels, the first having reference to the governing side in the assembly, the male side; the other, to the affectionate, subjective side; both combining according to the teaching of the Lord in our souls.<a name=423:2></a> So that we have three communications made to Joseph in Matthew and none to Mary, whereas Mary is more prominent in Luke.<a name=423:3></a> The instruction would be that the believers in a locality are taken account of responsibly; and in Joseph we have an example of entire submission to divine communications, and to divine indications too; without such we shall have derangement and cleavage.<a name=423:4></a> So that it says of Joseph in the passage read in the first chapter, that he "having awoke up from his sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had enjoined him", and then in the next chapter: "And, having arisen, he took to him the little child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt", and then: "And he arose and took to him the little child and its mother, and came into the land of Israel".<a name=423:5></a> He is thus representative, it seems, of the more responsible element, whereas in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:38">Luke  1:38</a>, Zacharias who represents this, fails; and Mary not only says: "Behold the bondmaid of the Lord; be it to me according to thy word", but she has a composition; she immediately adds to the service of God.<a name=423:6></a> If the responsible, ruling side is subject and trustworthy, the subjective side will come into line, so that the service of God is continued in obedience and trustworthiness in those that are responsible.<a name=423:7></a>

		These scriptures speak of the field, and the garden, and the house.<a name=439:1></a> They are peculiarly applicable to the assembly, applicable to the Lord's people; the more familiar we are with any scripture, the more it yields to us.<a name=439:2></a> We can understand how the writer of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#119">Psalm  119</a>meditated in the law continuously, and how patiently too he put down his thoughts; exhausting language, as it were, and yet not exhausting it, but taxing it fully: and, of course, it should be taxed.<a name=439:3></a> One of the most remarkable things in the creation is human language.<a name=439:4></a> Man is not the first to use it, for, according to Scripture, "God said, Let there be light" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:3">Genesis  1:3</a>).<a name=439:5></a> He had entered upon a piece of work which He was to accomplish by the day, and it began with light.<a name=439:6></a> Ever since that, light is shining: "God is light" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#1:5">1 John  1:5</a>); indeed, He has come into it, and is it Himself, He is light.<a name=439:7></a> So that language should be taxed, especially in setting out the mind of God, His word, His commandments, His precepts and ordinances, all that in any way bring to us what God is.<a name=439:8></a> The word field has a remarkable place in Scripture and it occurred to me after dinner, to be simple, in what we regard as a rural district, that it would not be out of place to bring in the agricultural side of the truth.<a name=439:9></a> The word field is used in a variety of senses: the Lord Himself used it to designate the world, the world in which as a field He was operating; for although He came to His own, He never lost sight of the fact that He was in the world; for it is said, "He was in the world .<a name=439:10></a>.<a name=439:11></a>.<a name=439:12></a> and the world knew him not" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:10">John  1:10</a>).<a name=439:13></a> It was made by Him, but knew Him not.<a name=439:14></a> As its Creator, He could not but be affected as coming into it, coming into it with the sensibilities of a man; able to think of its mountains, its hills, its rivers, its

		Well, now, all this enters into this verse in Genesis where we have a boy, a young man, older than some of us think, perhaps, at this time, Jacob; he is likened to a field.<a name=441:9></a> Then, again we have a person, the spouse, in Song of Songs likened to a garden; and in Luke, the house introduced incidentally.<a name=441:10></a> It must be there, that is the obvious thought; but it is only mentioned as it is marked by what is attractive, especially for young people.<a name=441:11></a> The moral is obvious; it is the prodigal, that kind of a man; in other words, it is composed of men like that.<a name=441:12></a> What interesting men they are!<a name=441:13></a> Were I to go up to heaven and be introduced to all the angels, I should find none like those persons who form the assembly.<a name=441:14></a> The Lord took his disciples, on the principle of selection, up the mountain in order that they might get a view of the persons, not of angels, they were not in view at all, but of two men talking with Jesus.<a name=441:15></a> Luke mentions the men first and gives the names afterwards.<a name=441:16></a> The point is, they are men.<a name=441:17></a> Matthew mentions the names

		Well, dear brethren, we see, therefore, what the house is and how attractive it is, especially to young persons.<a name=442:10></a> It is no dead, lifeless place, but a crowd of names.<a name=442:11></a> It began with persons of distinction; every one of them could tell you wonderful things as you conversed with him.<a name=442:12></a> You say to yourself, I cannot find anything like this anywhere else!<a name=442:13></a> I will come to that at the end.<a name=442:14></a>

		But this thought of the field: it is one person, evidently; it is not the thought of the world, not the field as described in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13">Matthew  13</a>it is a more limited thought.<a name=442:15></a> It denotes a certain kind of soil, a certain kind of fruitfulness; it has got a smell, and it is not only fruitful, but blessed of the Lord.<a name=442:16></a> This may be likened to a young christian, indeed, such is in view; and how the patriarch, dull as he was as the context shews (Isaac

		was dull spiritually, but he was not too dull to smell this matter), says, "The smell of a field which the Lord hath blessed".<a name=443:1></a> The idea of the exercise of the senses is mentioned much in Scripture, and smell is not the least; Isaac is not wanting in this sense.<a name=443:2></a> His affections are aroused by the man he is speaking to.<a name=443:3></a> He has testified about him, but he has not testified as to the actual substance that is there; a remarkable thing, shewing how the work of God links with the work of God.<a name=443:4></a> No doubt Isaac afterwards often judged himself that his eyes were not in relation to his sense of smell.<a name=443:5></a> We may often feel a thing is right and yet we go against it, perhaps because of our appetites or selfish desires.<a name=443:6></a> If there is a sense of smell, and other things do not agree, wait awhile and the Lord will make it plain; so we may be saved from turning our backs on a real field that God has in mind for great blessing, great results.<a name=443:7></a> He prepares His field without: we are to do the same.<a name=443:8></a> I was alluding to the west; undoubtedly God prepared this field.<a name=443:9></a> "Prepare thy work without, and put thy field in order"; God did that too and then got His house: "and afterwards build thy house" (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#24:27">Proverbs  24:27</a>).<a name=443:10></a> That is about all I had to say about Jacob; much more could be said of a brother or sister who has given evidence of potential fruitfulness; not only that they possess ability, education and following graces, but that the Lord has blessed them.<a name=443:11></a> Without that, all else is nothing; it may be a field for the world, for Satan, in such a person.<a name=443:12></a> Indeed, we may be sure if there is any thought of one of us being a field for God, Satan will seek to get in too, as we learn in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13">Matthew  13</a>.<a name=443:13></a>

		Well, now, that is the great general thought in Genesis.<a name=443:14></a> We have a garden too before we have a field in the way that I am speaking of it, but I go on to Song of Songs for the idea of the garden, because it is what is special; it is what the field, as it were, may develop into.<a name=443:15></a> The field, being a wider thought, develops into the garden, at least, spiritually.<a name=443:16></a> Jacob, subsequent to this remarkable

		word, scarcely yielded unselfishly; the fruit was not very quick in coming.<a name=444:1></a> He went off into a place and circumstances that would tend to preclude the crop that God had in mind; at least, he stayed too long there.<a name=444:2></a> Had he confined himself to the orders given him, to seek a suitable wife and return, there would have been no interference with the crop; but he remained twenty years instead of remaining a few days.<a name=444:3></a> That is to say, he made way for the enemy, and the enemy did not fail to sow the tares, both in himself and in his family; bitter results followed, until he is back again in Bethel where God could again stand beside him, where he is conscious of divine favour, the blessing of the Lord that makes rich; he was a field which the Lord had blessed.<a name=444:4></a> But the blessing, the true riches that were in mind, really belonged to Bethel and Canaan, so that the blessing of the Lord began as he returned to Bethel.<a name=444:5></a> His name was changed.<a name=444:6></a> The kind of fruit he had been bearing was not such as Isaac smelled.<a name=444:7></a> So it is with many in early life after conversion; the young ones get away, although the blessing is there potentially; other crops come up and cause the greatest sorrow as it was with Jacob.<a name=444:8></a> "The blessing of Jehovah, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow to it" (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#10:22">Proverbs  10:22</a>).<a name=444:9></a> Why the sorrow then?<a name=444:10></a> I have done it; it is my own addition.<a name=444:11></a> How many have had that history!<a name=444:12></a> Instead of pursuing the line of grace with which we began, we have made room for the enemy to come in.<a name=444:13></a> The Lord says: "A man that is an enemy has done this" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13:28">Matthew  13:28</a>).<a name=444:14></a> That is the sowing of the tares: the parents may not see it, but God sees it; God sees just where the enemy got in.<a name=444:15></a> Now Jacob is back at Bethel, and, as I was saying, the garden develops into something for Christ, some positive result unselfishly kept for Christ; definite headway may be made.<a name=444:16></a> So He says in spirit here: "A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed".<a name=444:17></a> We see now how in the individual saint there is the thought of a garden which
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		involves quality and is not exactly for the sustenance of the house but rather for pleasure; so the feminine personage is alluded to: "A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse".<a name=445:1></a> There is the definite recognition by the Lord of family relationship.<a name=445:2></a> There is a certain loyalty and conservation in the idea of a garden viewed thus.<a name=445:3></a> She is a sister; the sister must come before the spouse.<a name=445:4></a> This is not the field; this describes the development of love, a known relation with Christ; indeed, He owns it, and it is much better that He should own it than that I should claim it.<a name=445:5></a> We should claim it; until we claim it we hardly can come into the benefit of it, but still, we are on more solid ground when He owns it.<a name=445:6></a> So the wives of the patriarchs were to be sisters; and it is certainly a mark of progress when the Lord owns this relation: "my sister", and then "my spouse"; and then the thought of jealous guarding of what there is.<a name=445:7></a> Much indeed there is, much contemplated: "Thy shoots are a paradise of pomegranates, with precious fruits; henna, with spikenard plants; spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices: a fountain in the gardens, a well of living waters, which stream from Lebanon".<a name=445:8></a> One would appeal to all as to this remarkable result of the work of God, the conservation, as I was saying, in view of Another; not for oneself, for one would not have the brethren think him spiritual; if one is spiritual it will become known.<a name=445:9></a> There is no question about that: if there is one thing one can testify about the saints it is that in the long run they know who is who.<a name=445:10></a> It is not here that one should have a reputation amongst the brethren; the more spiritual one is, the more reputation one will have.<a name=445:11></a> The saints in general, in the long run, come to discern who is who and what one's measure is.<a name=445:12></a> We may as well make up our minds for that.<a name=445:13></a> So the speaker here is not thinking of that; the record here has not that in mind: the Lord in spirit contemplates that all this is

		here conserved in view of Himself; as much as to say, It is not for another.<a name=446:1></a> I may even make spiritual adornments an object so that I might be attractive to others.<a name=446:2></a> It is a most deceptive and insidious thing to acquire ability in divine things, and so adorn oneself and then think of oneself, that one is attractive in it.<a name=446:3></a> There is nothing of the kind here; it is what is for Him: and what a variety there is, dear brethren: "pomegranates, with precious fruits; henna with spikenard plants; spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices: a fountain in the gardens".<a name=446:4></a> It is a remarkable description of prosperity in one to whom Christ is all, and in all; in fact, in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3:11">Colossians  3:11</a>, He is "everything, and in all".<a name=446:5></a> If He is everything objectively, He is in all I have got.<a name=446:6></a> He is there indisputably with no rival; and that is what gives it its greatness, its attractiveness, that it is Christ "everything, and in all".<a name=446:7></a>

		Well, now, she speaks of the north wind in verse 16: "Awake, north wind, and come, thou south; blow upon my garden"; that is, the Lord is speaking about all this from His point of view, but I should not be satisfied without examining myself in everything.<a name=446:8></a> The Lord is never behind in impressing us with what is due to us, but yet, I know what I am, and I had better look in and look around; so she actually calls for the north wind to awake, and nothing will bring out what is there like that; it will bring it forward.<a name=446:9></a> The north wind will bring out the spices.<a name=446:10></a> She needs that, the discipline of God.<a name=446:11></a> She knows well what is there; and, dear brethren, it is right we should look around inwardly.<a name=446:12></a> Romans teaches us the idea of inward analysis, and I doubt if any of us will be a garden without that.<a name=446:13></a> Whatever any faculty is capable of, it is to be that "Christ is everything, and in all".<a name=446:14></a> "If Christ be in you, the body is dead on account of sin, but the Spirit life on account of righteousness" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:10">Romans  8:10</a>).<a name=446:15></a> So that one has a good conscience and can stand up in the presence of the

		Then, as to the house, just a brief thought for the young people here, that there is more in christianity than they have been accustomed to think.<a name=447:4></a> Any confused thought in young people may be due to conditions in the place where they have been.<a name=447:5></a> Now the material of the house, what it is composed of, is: "yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:5">1 Peter  2:5</a>).<a name=447:6></a> Who are these people?<a name=447:7></a> Those who come to Christ, 'living stones', that kind of people.<a name=447:8></a> Paul says, as I was remarking, "Whose house are <i>we</i>, if indeed we hold fast the boldness and the boast of hope firm to the end" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#3:6">Hebrews  3:6</a>).<a name=447:9></a> This is the kind of people!<a name=447:10></a> What God is offering to us, young people, is attractive, what He thinks is attractive; you cannot get the like of these people anywhere, even if you ransack the universe.<a name=447:11></a> We prove it in our convocations, and those of us who are going on will testify to that; the more we progress, the more the people of God are to us.<a name=447:12></a> So Peter says: 'living stones', a remarkable designation of persons who are moving towards Christ.<a name=447:13></a> You will find them where He is, not in places of amusement and such like.<a name=447:14></a> They are moving towards Christ, and He is the living stone.<a name=447:15></a> There is nothing else like this in the universe, and Paul makes it perfectly plain that it is ourselves, ourselves characteristically, not merely the brethren here.<a name=447:16></a> "Whose house are <i>we</i>", and then, as if to enlarge on the thought he says: "Ye

		The scriptures read in the New Testament speak of God's witness within us, within believers.<a name=449:1></a> The first witness or testimony to us is what is called objective, as is said, indeed, in the same chapter read from in 1 John (verse 6): "It is the Spirit that bears witness"; and again, in Hebrews, the Spirit is witness to us as regards forgiveness: for these scriptures read speak of witness in us, having in view to set us up in spiritual consciousness, self-consciousness; and also to make us spiritually independent, able in self-consciousness to stand on our own feet; being thus, as it were, a spiritual entity, as each angel is in heaven, to be employed by God as congenial material, such as He is entitled to, ready to hand at any time.<a name=449:2></a> The uses for which we are intended are great and various, and it is humbling if God has to look about for agencies.<a name=449:3></a> At times He is forced to use incongruous agencies for the reason that what is normal fails.<a name=449:4></a> It should not be so, but it is so oft-times, and in order to carry on His work, God is obliged to use what is in itself incongruous.<a name=449:5></a> He uses an ass for instance; and, indeed, the Lord said as to praise, if those who praised were silent, the stones would cry out.<a name=449:6></a> Such is God's power that He can take on agencies for His purpose; He would give us to understand that He is independent in that way.<a name=449:7></a> But still, on the other hand, He would give us to understand that He has need of each of us; and in order that we should be available, there is this need, this necessity of spiritual preparedness, involving complete immunity from the demands and influence of the flesh.<a name=449:8></a> Isaiah said: "Here am I; send me" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#6:8">Isaiah  6:8</a>) and immediately he was sent, and again: "There was a man sent from God, his name John" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:6">John  1:6</a>); he was the product of long preparation, but as the time of his shewing to Israel

		Now Paul, in the epistle to the Romans and other epistles, confirms all that; but in the verse I read in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>, it speaks about the Spirit, not simply witnessing to us in this general way that John speaks of it, but that the Spirit witnesses with our spirits that we are children of God.<a name=452:6></a> Think of that experience we can afford ourselves!<a name=452:7></a> in the night, in wakeful hours, or in the busy hours of the day, at the desk, or the machine-shop, or the wash-tub, wherever we may be, we have this blessed inwardness of the Spirit witnessing with our spirit that we are God's children.<a name=452:8></a> It is as if to say, 'Do not be overcome by that, you are God's children!<a name=452:9></a>' The Spirit would bring it in for victory that we are God's children.<a name=452:10></a> John enlarges on it: "See what love the Father has given to us, that we should be called the children of God" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:1">1 John  3:1</a>).<a name=452:11></a> That is our name: 'children of God'.<a name=452:12></a> It is known in heaven, but the Spirit is saying it all the time inwardly: 'You are children of God whatever happens, do not forget that'; what an enlargement follows!<a name=452:13></a> what comfort!<a name=452:14></a> what assurance!<a name=452:15></a> There can be no abnegation of this wonderful relation into which we are brought: the Holy Spirit within us is witnessing with our spirits that it is truly so, we are children of God.<a name=452:16></a> And "if children", says the apostle, victoriously, "heirs also: heirs of God, and Christ's joint heirs; if indeed we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified with him" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:17">Romans  8:17</a>).<a name=452:17></a>

		Having said all that, I want to shew examples of it in the Old Testament.<a name=454:6></a> What I have been saying so clearly refers to simple christianity; Romans is an elementary epistle and furnishes all this instruction, so that every believer here should know something of it: but if one does not, he has not learned the initial blessings of christianity, and the object of this meeting is that he might know it; that everyone might be directed to this matter so that we become spiritually independent -- that every wind of doctrine does not affect us, that we stand upright in the things that we know.<a name=454:7></a> We shall thus have reached self-consciousness in a spiritual sense, supported consciously in the witness, as it says, he has the witness in himself who believes on the Son of God; and again, "The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit, that we are children of God".<a name=454:8></a> That is to say, he is now on christian ground consciously, and if John's epistle is pursued, he is victorious in it.<a name=454:9></a> What is needed now, dear brethren, is just that, so that we might be overcomers; and, indeed, as I want to shew you, have part in the service of God, which is in mind for every christian.<a name=454:10></a> We are left down here

		J.T.<a name=528:1></a> What is in mind is to call attention to the Lord's early movements in the history of the assembly, and then His movements at the end of the history, and the results.<a name=528:2></a> The chapter in Genesis speaks about Isaac.<a name=528:3></a> The servant of Abraham was returning with the camels and with Rebecca, but Isaac had just returned from Beer-lahai-roi, or literally, he came from coming to that well, meaning that it was an object in his mind.<a name=528:4></a> Our attention is thus called to the Spirit, the whole chapter indeed being marked by the Spirit of God typically, as the servant himself who went for Rebecca denotes the action of the Spirit.<a name=528:5></a> Rebecca, too, is so ready in the use of water, furnishing it so readily for the servant and his camels: she, also, is marked typically by the Spirit, and it is said of her that she sprang off the camel.<a name=528:6></a> Isaac, as culminating the type from that point of view, is seen occupied with the well; as having come to it, he is seen coming from it, as dwelling in the south country.<a name=528:7></a> Corresponding with this in the antitype, we have great stress laid on the Holy Spirit, both in the Lord's instructions, as seen in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>, then in the actual coming of the Spirit in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>, and so right on to Stephen, who is pre-eminently marked as a vessel of the Spirit.<a name=528:8></a> Beer-lahai-roi, which first came into evidence in regard to Hagar and is the first well mentioned in the Scriptures, would point to the action of the Spirit in grace in relation to the Jews.<a name=528:9></a> Isaac, who is an object of attack or persecution by Hagar's son, recognises this well.<a name=528:10></a> There is no feeling other than to recognise it as of value.<a name=528:11></a> He is coming from it here, so that whatever is developed under the ministry of the twelve at Jerusalem is in view.<a name=528:12></a> The Lord, in view of the changed position, says to Saul,
