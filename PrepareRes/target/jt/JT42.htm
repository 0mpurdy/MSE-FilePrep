		These scriptures treat of priesthood.<a name=1:1></a> They treat of it as it should appear in our times; not that there is any change from earlier times, but as time brings about changes, God meets these by stressing certain features.<a name=1:2></a> We have in these scriptures the features of priesthood that should especially appear in these dark apostate days.<a name=1:3></a> As evil men arise and seducers wax worse and worse, God stresses His truth, giving edge to it; in no way does He weaken His truth, in no way does He lower the standard of it to meet by way of compromise the opposition that has appeared.<a name=1:4></a> His word, we are told, is as a two-edged sword, and God gives sharpness to His truth as exigencies arise in the history of His people.<a name=1:5></a> While this may tend to smallness and what is outwardly despicable in those who hold to the truth in this way, there is what God regards as a testimony, a very great matter with Him.<a name=1:6></a> The Lord Jesus told the leper to go to the priest and show himself and offer the sacrifices required by the law for a testimony to them.<a name=1:7></a> Whether they will hear or whether they will forbear, we are told, the testimony is there; and God will be able to say, when He enters into judgment, which He is about to do, with the world in general, with nations severally, with states, with towns, with villages, and with men, that in no case has He left Himself without witness.<a name=1:8></a> Whether it be to a monarch or to a slave, God will be able to say, "Thou knewest all this" (<a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#5:22">Daniel  5:22</a>).<a name=1:9></a>

		Now the book of Revelation, as the word means, is an unveiling of conditions and happenings so that we might see them beforehand; indeed, the book is written to us, as the address in the beginning of the paragraph which I read indicates -- "John to the seven assemblies which are in Asia", meaning the whole

		responsible body.<a name=2:1></a> It is therefore in the library of the assembly to be read.<a name=2:2></a> No book in the christian library should he left unread; but above all this one should be read; there is a premium attached to it.<a name=2:3></a> And so the apostle Paul in his closing moments, when the outlook was dark, directed Timothy to bring the books and especially the parchments.<a name=2:4></a> Even he, in those closing moments when there was such pressure upon him, thought of books, as also did Daniel of old when he said, "I Daniel understood by the books" (<a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#9:2">Daniel  9:2</a>).<a name=2:5></a> So that it is not only the library and the reading but the understanding -- "Blessed is he that reads".<a name=2:6></a> Later on in this same paragraph John speaks directly to us, and introduces this great thought of priesthood in his address.<a name=2:7></a> "To him who loves us, and has washed us from our sins in his blood, and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father".<a name=2:8></a> That is to say, he intimates at the very outset of this wonderful book, that God has a system of things; He has a kingdom made of persons that have been washed by the precious blood of Christ, trusted persons, and the individual members of this kingdom are priests unto God.<a name=2:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in chapter 5, we have a similar word, but not the same.<a name=2:10></a> We have the living creatures and the elders singing a new song.<a name=2:11></a> It is a poetic matter, and they are singing about others, who out of every tribe, tongue, and nation have been redeemed or bought with the blood of Christ; that is, He has a right over them; He has bought them.<a name=2:12></a> They are not said to be a kingdom; they are said to be kings and priests unto God; that is, the thought is extended universally.<a name=2:13></a> In chapters 1 and 5 the bearing of the priesthood is Godward, unto God, as if God were to say, 'Whatever you are going on with, whatever coldness, indifference, or callousness marks you, I have priests unto me; I have not given up my thought at all'.<a name=2:14></a> He would say of Aaron that he was to minister unto Him in the priest's office; that is, it is an office, and the ministry is to be carried on by

	<div class="paragraph">
		priests in that office.<a name=3:1></a> So it is now; however few or many, God here intimates to us that He has His priests; they are unto Him.<a name=3:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then in chapter 20, we have again people risen and reigning with Christ.<a name=3:3></a> They also are said to be priests -- not to God, but of God.<a name=3:4></a> I want you to follow this, dear brethren, because it is this latter passage that I desire to open up a little.<a name=3:5></a> We must have priesthood <i>to</i> God, before we can have priesthood <i>of</i> God; that is, God has priests, those that belong to Him, they are characteristically His, for their ministry is towards Him.<a name=3:6></a> They live and reign with Christ, beautiful and glorious thought, they live and reign with Christ a thousand years, but they are priests of God and of Christ.<a name=3:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I will go back for a moment to chapter 1, so as to bring out the position of the kingdom.<a name=3:8></a> He has made us, we are told, a kingdom.<a name=3:9></a> Kingdoms rise and fall, you know.<a name=3:10></a> The greatest of all kingdoms in the history of this world as regards fame and longevity and power, was Rome.<a name=3:11></a> We read of its decline and its fall.<a name=3:12></a> The writer of that book, himself an infidel, did not understand the book of Revelation.<a name=3:13></a> Rome is coming up again, and all the world will marvel at its head, wonder at it.<a name=3:14></a> Solemn consideration for us who know the truth of what is coining!<a name=3:15></a> The head of it with all his power and his fame will be taken alive, we are told, and cast into the lake of fire, with his prime minister, the second beast.<a name=3:16></a> He is taken away before his army is destroyed.<a name=3:17></a> Such is the power of God as seen in dealing with evil.<a name=3:18></a> It is only a matter of time, beloved friends.<a name=3:19></a> The powers that be are ordained of God.<a name=3:20></a> We have to understand the difference.<a name=3:21></a> We are to pray for them; we are to be subject to them -- but the people of God are never enjoined to be subject to this great power of which I am speaking.<a name=3:22></a> What a time they will have!<a name=3:23></a> Think of the conflict, the open opposition, and the greatest power operating against a few saints of God!<a name=3:24></a> What affliction!<a name=3:25></a> What suffering!<a name=3:26></a> Hence those

		Well now, in chapter 5, as I was saying, it is priests to God again, but in a wider sense.<a name=6:3></a> We have the living creatures first in this chapter.<a name=6:4></a> We might wonder why that is.<a name=6:5></a> It is a chapter of energy; that is the secret of the chapter.<a name=6:6></a> We need energy in the things of God.<a name=6:7></a> But they sing a new song; when I admit the thought of something new I say, 'Well, the way we have been doing things may not be just right'.<a name=6:8></a> We always need the principle of revision, being what we are.<a name=6:9></a> The constant tendency, beloved brethren, is declension towards the world, worldliness, worldly-mindedness: men admit this thing and that thing, and it seems nothing at the time, but in the aggregate, we have adulteration; so we need revision.<a name=6:10></a> It is very wholesome to look over things, you know, and see what happened.<a name=6:11></a> You say, 'Well, this was done before'.<a name=6:12></a> Well the book of Jeremiah tells us that at one time he was arrested, and what were they going to do with him?<a name=6:13></a> An old man said, 'Such and such a thing happened in the days of Hezekiah and the person that was to be prosecuted or put to death, was not put to death'.<a name=6:14></a> This was in favour of Jeremiah.<a name=6:15></a> Others said, 'Such and such a thing happened in the reign of another king and he <i>was</i> put to death;' so where are we?<a name=6:16></a> We need revision.<a name=6:17></a> This information does not help.<a name=6:18></a> It is not balanced.<a name=6:19></a> It is balance in a way but we have nothing.<a name=6:20></a> What are we to do under those circumstances?<a name=6:21></a> Well, beloved, they sing a new song, we are told here, and there are twenty-four elders, and four living creatures, the very pick of the results of the work of God.<a name=6:22></a> But you see, they sing a <i>new</i> song; they remind us that things must be always fresh and new.<a name=6:23></a> They are talking about others, that God has bought others.<a name=6:24></a> You understand they would say, Look here, God knows you, from every tribe, and kingdom, and nation, He has bought you with the precious blood of His Son, and He has made

		Then in chapter 20, we have a risen people.<a name=7:3></a> It is a glorious chapter.<a name=7:4></a> There are really three classes mentioned in the resurrection; they are on the throne, and they are all said to be priests unto God, priests of God and of the Christ.<a name=7:5></a> Are they not representative?<a name=7:6></a> They are.<a name=7:7></a> It involves, as it were, that they are of God, but they are representative here; they live and reign with Christ a thousand years.<a name=7:8></a> What perfection is represented in these priests!<a name=7:9></a> I can understand priests coming to any particular part of the earth in that thousand years.<a name=7:10></a> A matter comes up for adjudication.<a name=7:11></a> Will you not have a perfect verdict?<a name=7:12></a> Ah, yes!<a name=7:13></a> Everything will be as perfect as God is, speaking reverently.<a name=7:14></a> The assembly is said to grow into a holy temple in the Lord.<a name=7:15></a> That is what will mark the millennium.<a name=7:16></a> Everything will come out in the temple, and they will be exactly according to the mind of God.<a name=7:17></a> What a glorious order of things that will be!<a name=7:18></a> It is in prospect, and we ourselves are amongst them.<a name=7:19></a> We come first, as a matter of fact, in this category in chapter 20.<a name=7:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this expression, "of God and of the Christ" I want to link on with Malachi to show you how priesthood works out.<a name=7:21></a> I am speaking of it now, dear brethren, because it is so important at the present time that this element of priests of God and of the Christ should have its place, and the description that we have in this last book of the Old Testament is very significant.<a name=7:22></a> It is a fuller description; it is a description that you do not get anywhere else; not that you do not get the description of priesthood -- you do; in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#28">Exodus  28</a>and 29, and <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#8">Leviticus  8</a>we have priesthood as it was primarily established; but in Malachi we have to do with dark things, with apostate days, corresponding to Revelation, as I have been saying; hence, we have particular features of the priesthood stressed, and Jehovah says,

	<div class="paragraph">
		"Now, ye priests" [whoever you are] "this commandment is for you".<a name=8:1></a> In this book, dear brethren, it is remarkable that God says in verse 4 of the last chapter that the law of Moses "which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel" should be remembered; it was not simply for the remnant, but for all Israel; that is, the law is in full force.<a name=8:2></a> People say, Well we must change to meet the times.<a name=8:3></a> That is the great bane of christendom.<a name=8:4></a> It is compromise to meet the times, and christianity is well nigh lost; priesthood certainly is.<a name=8:5></a> Malachi says, 'Now look ye, here is the law, and it is not only for the remnant'.<a name=8:6></a> There is no law for the remnant.<a name=8:7></a> Properly it is the law which He commanded at Horeb for all Israel.<a name=8:8></a> You see where we stand.<a name=8:9></a> What a magnificent position on the one hand, but how serious on the other.<a name=8:10></a> And who are to be trusted in regard to this great matter?<a name=8:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The law, in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#33">Deuteronomy  33</a>, is said to be a heritage.<a name=8:12></a> It is not an irksome obligation, a code; it is a heritage.<a name=8:13></a> Every man who loves God sees that it is a heritage, and we want it; and the priests' business, dear brethren, is to see to it that it is maintained, and so you have this description.<a name=8:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are eight items in the description, and the first one is that Jehovah said, 'I made a covenant with Levi at the beginning.<a name=8:15></a> I made a covenant with him of life and peace;' that is to say, 'I set him up like a Supreme Court, independent of all other influence.<a name=8:16></a> I set him up with an income.<a name=8:17></a> I made a covenant with him of life and peace'.<a name=8:18></a> And then He says, "And I gave them to him that he might fear; and he feared me, and trembled before my name".<a name=8:19></a> It says elsewhere that the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom.<a name=8:20></a> God has great regard for those that fear Him.<a name=8:21></a> He says, "but to this man will I look: to the afflicted and contrite in spirit, and who trembleth at my word" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#66:2">Isaiah  66:2</a>).<a name=8:22></a> Trembling at the word of God brings in divine protection.<a name=8:23></a> "I will not be afraid:" says another, "what

	<div class="paragraph">
		In thinking of this meeting, dear brethren, and taking account of the occasion of it, these verses came into my mind because of the word "yourselves" or "themselves".<a name=14:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle John in his epistle speaks in this way, as the matter of spiritual teaching came before him.<a name=14:2></a> He begins the verse with this pronoun <i>"yourselves"</i> as if to rest on that word before proceeding to speak of the Spirit as the anointing; so we should ponder or dwell on the great distinction by which heaven marks us off, that is christians, from the world.<a name=14:3></a> Many christians do not accept the distinction which God has put upon us as marking us off from the world.<a name=14:4></a> The idea arises in Exodus where we have the plague of gnats or lice inflicted on the Egyptians.<a name=14:5></a> The thought in that plague is life, but life in creatures which are not regarded as desirable, but as despicable and peculiarly objectionable.<a name=14:6></a> These little creatures were inflicted upon the Egyptians as one of the plagues in order that the world should loosen its hold on the saints, on the Israelites.<a name=14:7></a> That plague is never said to have been withdrawn; others are, and this means, spiritually, the continuance of the saints here on earth according to the will of God, however objectionable they may be.<a name=14:8></a> We are not withdrawn from the world until the will of God requires it; the Lord prayed for us saying, "I do not demand that thou shouldest take them out of the world" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#17:15">John  17:15</a>).<a name=14:9></a> Some, as they get old, wish to go to be with the Lord; this may he sentiment, or feeling, or from suffering, but the safe thing, dear brethren, is to accept the will of God.<a name=14:10></a> That is, as our birth is on His calendar, so is our death, if we are to die.<a name=14:11></a> If it be translation, or if it be quickening on account of God's Spirit which dwells in us, that also is on the divine
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=15>[Page 15]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		calendar, and will not take place until the time appointed.<a name=15:1></a> This chapter speaks of those who do the will of God, and they abide for ever, whether it be down here or in heaven, they abide for ever.<a name=15:2></a> Doing the will of God implies that we recognise His will in regard to our histories, whether it be births, new births, or our dissolutions, or our translations into heaven as quickened by the Spirit.<a name=15:3></a> Quickening of our bodies by the Spirit, I may say here, dear brethren, refers to our living bodies; rising refers to our dead bodies.<a name=15:4></a> Whether it be the one or the other, all is a question of the will of God.<a name=15:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so the plague of gnats or lice is not said to have been withdrawn; obviously because God intends that His people should continue on here at His will, whatever the world may think.<a name=15:6></a> They do not like us.<a name=15:7></a> The two witnesses in the book of Revelation witnessed to this fact; they witnessed so many days and at the end of that time they were slain, but it was not until the end of that time, the end of the allotted time.<a name=15:8></a> They were slain; as soon as the world's hand is released it will inflict persecution upon the people of God.<a name=15:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this is very important as to the plague of gnats because it typically is the saints now as living.<a name=15:10></a> They lived; they were formed of the dust of the earth and made to live.<a name=15:11></a> The dust of the earth is not appreciated by this world at all.<a name=15:12></a> They said, "Away with such a one as that from the earth, for it was not fit he should live" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#22:22">Acts  22:22</a>), but Paul did live for many years after.<a name=15:13></a> It is a question of the will of God, whatever the world may think.<a name=15:14></a> And then after that plague we have this distinguishing mark -- "I will put a separation", says Jehovah, "between my people and thy people" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#8:23">Exodus  8:23</a>).<a name=15:15></a> The word may be translated 'redemption', which would imply that the rights of God were asserted in claiming this people.<a name=15:16></a> What a precious thing that is!<a name=15:17></a> But Jehovah would say that His people were distinct from the Egyptians in the way of life.<a name=15:18></a> They

	<div class="paragraph">
		were marked off.<a name=16:1></a> And so John speaks thus; he says <i>"yourselves"</i>.<a name=16:2></a> One can understand how in his affections for the saints, the apostle would rest in that word <i>"yourselves"</i>.<a name=16:3></a> How precious it is to be in that class, designated formally in this way, "<i>yourselves</i>", a class by yourselves.<a name=16:4></a> Let every young christian here understand it: "<i>yourselves</i>".<a name=16:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And another thing is, as you rest in this great fact, this distinction, you do not need that any one should teach you.<a name=16:6></a> I need not say that this word "teach" does not refer to ordinary grammar or high school education.<a name=16:7></a> Such education is necessary today at least in order that young persons should get a livelihood.<a name=16:8></a> We ought to be simple and sober in our interpretation of Scripture.<a name=16:9></a> God is practical in all He says, and Scripture is practical; so that what I have to say about this teaching does not refer to children going to grammar school or high school, but rather spiritual teaching, that the young christian is notified here that he does not need that any one should teach him.<a name=16:10></a> Now that word "one" has also to be understood.<a name=16:11></a> It is used very frequently in Scripture and very often refers to christians, and indeed, refers to Christ Himself; He is called a Man; so that it does not mean that we cannot be taught by man spiritually, for John was a teacher and he was a man.<a name=16:12></a> But we are not to be taught by men as men.<a name=16:13></a> An unconverted man may go to a college or seminary or university and acquire what is called theological training, theological ability.<a name=16:14></a> That is what is alluded to.<a name=16:15></a> You do not need any such teaching.<a name=16:16></a> That is what is meant.<a name=16:17></a> The Spirit of God foresaw that such ability would be in great demand, and it has become in great demand in the history of the assembly.<a name=16:18></a> It has taken a very great place, and children and young boys and girls, young men and young women are greatly exposed to danger from natural ability in that sense.<a name=16:19></a> The apostle is concerned in saying <i>"yourselves"</i>.<a name=16:20></a> Rest in that.<a name=16:21></a> You do not need that teaching.<a name=16:22></a> So that young

		people, going to high school particularly, are to be warned against this insidious influence that is so prevalent; that whilst you may learn physical things and practical every-day things in order to acquire a livelihood, you shut out all teaching that is regarded as spiritual, from such men.<a name=17:1></a> Such teaching as God intends for all young christians, is by the anointing.<a name=17:2></a> The apostle uses this word, undoubtedly, with great skill and great spiritual understanding.<a name=17:3></a> Instead of saying the Spirit, he uses this well-known word, "anointing", or "unction", which always gives distinction to the person or persons concerned; so it is that the young christian is notified here that he has that distinction; even over against his most learned teacher or professor he has that distinction.<a name=17:4></a> How often it happens that a child of some christian household, brought up in the truth, born again, believing the gospel and having the Spirit, can say what is far beyond anything that the most learned unconverted professor can say.<a name=17:5></a> He has the anointing and as he speaks the dignity is there, and what a thought it is for you young people, you young children going to school, that God has put dignity upon you that the most learned of your teachers has not.<a name=17:6></a> I am not saying that there are not teachers who are christians, but I am using the words as Scripture uses the word "one".<a name=17:7></a> As the apostle had to tell the Corinthians, they were partisan, they were just like men; that is, natural, unconverted men.<a name=17:8></a> The young child in the school may be able to speak of Christ; to speak of God, and the things of God in such a way as the most learned teacher cannot understand.<a name=17:9></a> The natural man does not understand the things of God, "he cannot know them because they are spiritually discerned" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:14">1 Corinthians  2:14</a>).<a name=17:10></a> Only he who has the Spirit of God knows the things of God.<a name=17:11></a> And that is what John has in mind.<a name=17:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, he says, "And <i>yourselves</i>, the unction which ye have received from

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		him abides in you".<a name=18:1></a> May each question himself as to whether he has received this precious thing called "the unction".<a name=18:2></a> "The same unction teaches you", it says, "as to all things".<a name=18:3></a> The Spirit of God is here, dear brethren, for that express purpose, and particularly now.<a name=18:4></a> I speak to the little children because they are addressed in this section of the chapter.<a name=18:5></a> The Spirit of God is here with you to teach you, as the apostle says.<a name=18:6></a> "But as the same unction teaches you as to all things, and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, ye shall abide in him".<a name=18:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, you see the force of the word "lie" here.<a name=18:8></a> It alludes today to what is called modernism or other such terms -- very attractive, very flattering to men, especially the term called 'higher criticism' -- very flattering.<a name=18:9></a> But it is a lie.<a name=18:10></a> The apostle John here, by the Spirit, is telling us that the anointing teaches us of all things, and is truth, and is not a lie.<a name=18:11></a> You cannot get it anywhere else, but by the Spirit's teaching.<a name=18:12></a> All human teaching is permeated by the lie.<a name=18:13></a> There is a lying twist in the best of it; hence, dear young people, the importance of understanding the dignity of the word "unction" here, and knowing that you have received it.<a name=18:14></a> It speaks to christians, little children, of Christ, as verse 18 tells us.<a name=18:15></a> This paragraph, beginning with that verse, is for the little children, spiritually.<a name=18:16></a> It is addressed to them.<a name=18:17></a> It is a dignifying thing, and it teaches them of all things, everything relating to God; all moral things that you need to know in relation to God and His things, and in which you are to be taught, and rightly taught by the Spirit.<a name=18:18></a> Otherwise you will drink in the lie, you will drink in the falsehood, and as you grow up it will increase.<a name=18:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, that is the first thought I had in mind, dear brethren, in regard to <i>"yourselves"</i>.<a name=18:20></a> I do earnestly ask you to rest in that, the distinction God has put upon yourselves, although you may be very young in the truth, that you may be entirely apart from human

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, now, I go on to the scripture read in the gospel of John.<a name=19:6></a> "By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have love amongst yourselves" -- <i>yourselves</i>.<a name=19:7></a> This section of John's gospel contemplates the Lord Jesus about to depart out of this world to the Father.<a name=19:8></a> The chapter begins thus, He is going away.<a name=19:9></a> It is said that, having loved His own which were in the world, He loved them to the end.<a name=19:10></a> They were in the world.<a name=19:11></a> Later He says, "I do not demand that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them out of evil" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#17:15">John  17:15</a>).<a name=19:12></a> They are in the world, <i>in</i> it, but not <i>of</i> it.<a name=19:13></a> We are always to understand Scripture textually, and when the Lord says His own, which are <i>in</i> the world, He means in the world, but not of it.<a name=19:14></a> Some are in it and of it, but the christian is in it and not of it.<a name=19:15></a> That is the Lord's thought, and so the word "yourselves" again contemplates us in distinction.<a name=19:16></a> "Love amongst yourselves" is not what is called universal love or love merely for humanity, but it is amongst yourselves, which means christians, disciples of the Lord Jesus.<a name=19:17></a> "Love one to another", of course, is the idea too, to a point, but I am sure that "love amongst yourselves" is the fuller and better translation, because it contemplates us as a class, "yourselves".<a name=19:18></a> Christians are in a class, which is to be known in this world as disciples

		Some are willing to go to a meeting like this, listen to a word and enjoy it in measure, and that is the end of it.<a name=20:5></a> Who the speaker may be, or where he abides is a matter of little consequence.<a name=20:6></a> That is to say, you do not wish to go further.<a name=20:7></a> Now, the divine idea in all these matters is that if I receive anything of God, whether it be teaching or whatever it be, I go further.<a name=20:8></a> That is what God loves; that you do not rest in what is just presented.<a name=20:9></a> You go further.<a name=20:10></a> And so the two disciples that heard Jesus speak, of whom we often speak ourselves, "followed Jesus" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:37">John  1:37</a>).<a name=20:11></a> And it says that He turned around and saw them following -- a beautiful sight in His eyes -- disciples following Him.<a name=20:12></a> He says, "What seek ye?<a name=20:13></a>" not 'Whom seek ye', but "what;" that is a challenge to our hearts.<a name=20:14></a> What are people seeking?<a name=20:15></a> What is your objective?<a name=20:16></a> What are you after?<a name=20:17></a> When you come to a meeting like this, what is in your mind?<a name=20:18></a> Is it a question of soul education?<a name=20:19></a> Is it a question of knowing more about God, or is it a matter of hearing someone that you have not heard before, for we do love variety in that way, which is of little value.<a name=20:20></a> Indeed, the Lord challenged them.<a name=20:21></a> He says, "What seek ye?<a name=20:22></a>" They say, "Rabbi".<a name=20:23></a> They expressed what was needful in their hearts; they needed instruction, and that is the dire need of the moment, beloved brethren, amongst the saints of God.<a name=20:24></a> I do not mean those that we know immediately here, but generally.<a name=20:25></a> But God says, "My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge" (<a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#4:6">Hosea  4:6</a>): a most serious matter.<a name=20:26></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		One can see how John would understand that this experience of wave after wave of grace from Christ would maintain freshness in the saints, and prevent hardness and legality.<a name=28:7></a> Some of us have been speaking of the great care with which the assembly at Philippi was initially guarded against Jewish influences, and this gospel has pre-eminently in mind to guard the saints and to deliver them from what is Jewish and from what is legality.<a name=28:8></a> So you can understand how wave after wave of grace going out from Christ, from His fulness, has the effect of spiritually moistening the saints, elevating them too in their service and responsibilities.<a name=28:9></a> He then adds "we all have received", for that is another principle with God, what is available is only effective <i>as received</i>.<a name=28:10></a> The suggestion is that the saints are maintained by the action of grace, "grace upon grace", but it is of Christ's fulness.<a name=28:11></a>

		Now we will pass on to chapter 17, in which the Lord speaks of His glorification just before it took place.<a name=34:4></a> That is another point with John, things are on the divine calendar, for the Lord says, "the hour is come".<a name=34:5></a> Nothing happens by chance, the hour is determined by the divine will and counsel, so He says "the hour is come".<a name=34:6></a> Had not that hour been anticipated in heaven?<a name=34:7></a> Oh yes, but the Lord in speaking to His Father knew that everything synchronised with that hour; all was finished on His side, and now the hour had come and He says, "Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son may glorify thee".<a name=34:8></a> He is still thinking of His Father, and as we follow down this chapter we see that He specifies the kind of glory that He sought.<a name=34:9></a> "And now glorify <i>me, thou</i> Father, along with thyself, with the glory which I had along with thee before the world was".<a name=34:10></a> That is another thing, it is a question of His deity, of His part with God -- "being in the form of God".<a name=34:11></a> But in this earlier verse, He is thinking of being glorified in keeping with the great administration which the Father had put into His hand, and which would now be exercised from heaven, where He would be in a position to glorify His Father.<a name=34:12></a> He could not do it save as He would have all things under His hand; so as Peter says, in connection with the coming out of the Spirit, "Having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this which <i>ye</i> behold and hear" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:33">Acts  2:33</a>).<a name=34:13></a> It was by the presence of the Spirit down here through redemption.<a name=34:14></a> He would glorify the Father -- "that thy Son may glorify thee", and then He adds, "As thou hast given him authority over all flesh, that as to all that thou hast given to him, he should give them life eternal".<a name=34:15></a> The giving of

		Then the final thought is in chapter 12, which refers to our knowledge of things.<a name=36:4></a> It says, "his disciples knew not these things at the first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things to him".<a name=36:5></a> This is a great feature of the glorification of Christ, and the outcome of it is that we understand.<a name=36:6></a> The Lord says, "How is it that ye do not understand?<a name=36:7></a>" Things are presented to us again and again, and the question is therefore, "How is it that ye do not understand?<a name=36:8></a>" John says, "And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us an understanding that we should know him that is true" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:20">1 John  5:20</a>).<a name=36:9></a> It is said by the apostle Paul that we have the mind of Christ, and moreover that the Spirit searches all things.<a name=36:10></a> The question therefore is very pertinent, "How is it that ye do not understand?<a name=36:11></a>" Is it due to some bias, or to some dark part?<a name=36:12></a> Is it some reservation in one's outlook?<a name=36:13></a> Christ has gone up far above all darkening influences, far above all heavens.<a name=36:14></a> He never could be dark, I need not say, but I am speaking now of the way things are put in Scripture.<a name=36:15></a> The Holy Spirit has come out unhampered, and herein is the power for our understanding; but mark you, not simply that He is here, but that He comes from a glorified Christ, that is the point.<a name=36:16></a> It was after that Christ was glorified that they understood.<a name=36:17></a> According to <a href="../bible/John.htm#2:19">John  2:19</a> - 22 they did not understand how the Lord could raise His own body.<a name=36:18></a> He says, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up".<a name=36:19></a> The Jews replied, "Forty and six years

		The public position of the saints here may be described under two heads, the one military and the other levitical.<a name=66:1></a> Both positions are typified in the book of Numbers.<a name=66:2></a> I have read these scriptures in order to enlarge on these two thoughts, especially to show that the military position, viewed as it is in Numbers, initiates the order of local responsibility, whereas the levitical position is not local but general or universal.<a name=66:3></a> From the passages I have read I hope by the Lord's help to show that the key-note is the Lord Himself, as indeed every truth in some way or another is exemplified in Him, for He is the pattern for us in every relationship.<a name=66:4></a>

		Now, what we find of the Lord is, as we see in this passage in Zechariah, that "he shall grow up from his own place;" the reference is to the Lord Jesus Christ as the Branch.<a name=67:1></a> He grew up in His place, that is, He never sought to alter His circumstances, and He fulfilled every obligation according to God.<a name=67:2></a> At the age of twelve He intimated, as having been in the temple with the doctors, that He was about His Father's business but it is said also, that He returned to Nazareth with His parents and was subject unto them.<a name=67:3></a> You will notice that the word Nazareth is used.<a name=67:4></a> He went down with them and came to Nazareth and was subject unto them.<a name=67:5></a> Nazareth did not afford that which youth would naturally seek after.<a name=67:6></a> It was not a city of any repute.<a name=67:7></a> It was, I judge, such a place as would be a test to youthfulness, and so, dear brethren, it should be an exercise with us that as under the government of God we ought not to alter our circumstances.<a name=67:8></a> It may be that they do not afford the gratifications that we might seek after; other places might seem more attractive, more interesting, it may be indeed that we are sure there would be special advantages in other localities.<a name=67:9></a> But look!<a name=67:10></a> It says, "He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was in subjection to them" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:51">Luke  2:51</a>), that is, to his parents.<a name=67:11></a> We see thus the perfect humanity of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=67:12></a> It was remarked by one later of Nazareth, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?<a name=67:13></a>" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:46">John  1:46</a>).<a name=67:14></a> The answer was "Come and see", but the remark clearly indicated that Nazareth was not a city of good repute.<a name=67:15></a> Well, the Lord grew up there, He grew up in His place.<a name=67:16></a> That is the point that I think we should lay hold of.<a name=67:17></a> Where He sets us in His perfect wisdom and ways, our wisdom is to abide there, to be content there, and in contentment coupled with godliness to grow up spiritually.<a name=67:18></a> "Piety with contentment", we read, "is great gain" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#6:6">1 Timothy  6:6</a>).<a name=67:19></a> It is said to be profitable for all things, but coupled with contentment is great gain.<a name=67:20></a> Now I would dwell on that point, because

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will remember that David is said to have had certain mighty men.<a name=86:2></a> In Chronicles a list of them is given at the beginning of his reign; they were said to be men that he had, and they came with a perfect heart to make him king.<a name=86:3></a> They were valiant, and at the beginning of his reign moved, not as a body of mighty men, but "with all Israel".<a name=86:4></a> Their might no doubt would be an occasion of communion between them, not to make them partisan or specialists but as seeking to make David king and to maintain him with all Israel.<a name=86:5></a> They were men with a universal outlook.<a name=86:6></a> In the second book of Samuel a list is given of David's men at the close of his reign, the same names generally are mentioned with certain variations, but the suggestion obviously is, that as a type, the chapter in the second book of Samuel points to the end of the dispensation in which we are, as if to afford inspiration for those of us who are in these last days to acquire this strength and maintain it, and to use it not for our own prominence or distinction, but as it were to make David king "with all Israel", and to maintain his place in the kingdom.<a name=86:7></a> This is what I have in mind, dear brethren, in reading these scriptures, and I do not believe I am aiming too high for there is latent strength in this company, spiritual strength, active strength, too, but it is more latent than active.<a name=86:8></a> Whilst latent strength is right up to a point, it is useless beyond that; when need exists and it does not come forth it is useless.<a name=86:9></a> Deborah reviews the position in her days in her song and dwells on certain who came forth to the conflict and others who did not.<a name=86:10></a> Not that they could not, not that they were not men of war, or men of valour, but

		they were neglectful of the need.<a name=87:1></a> God gave the victory without them but they lost much, and so it is always.<a name=87:2></a> The Lord always puts in His claim in the conflict and the conflict is not spasmodic, it properly continues as <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#6">Ephesians  6</a>, from which I have read, shows.<a name=87:3></a> There are special attacks of the enemy, and special defence, but the conflict is continuous.<a name=87:4></a> Hence there is a need for all to be on the alert and ready, as the apostle says, "Thou therefore, my child, be strong in the grace which is in Christ Jesus" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:1">2 Timothy  2:1</a>), and goes on to point out to Timotheus that no one enlists to be a soldier and retains his own interests; he is concerned about him who has enlisted him to be a soldier.<a name=87:5></a> So that we are all as it were under arms, ready to be called out, ready to be called into the conflict.<a name=87:6></a> We are not weaklings, we are to be strong in grace, we are to be strong in the grace which is in Christ Jesus, and as he says elsewhere, "quit yourselves like men; be strong" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#16:13">1 Corinthians  16:13</a>).<a name=87:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I selected John the baptist first, having in mind to connect my remarks with the idea of a girdle, or that by which we are girded, believing that, as these and many other scriptures indicate, a girdle implies the conservation of strength.<a name=87:8></a> It is one thing to acquire strength, and it is another to conserve it.<a name=87:9></a> Strength, I need not say, lies in the Spirit of God; it is He that affords us power, but then there is that which we call moral power which is also needed.<a name=87:10></a> It flows from a man's integrity, from a man's godliness, from a man's adherence to right principles, from his maintenance of a right spirit.<a name=87:11></a> These are moral qualities; they are, as it were, attributes.<a name=87:12></a> The Spirit is the power inside, inwardly, for we are to be strengthened, we are told, by the Father's Spirit in the inner man.<a name=87:13></a> But in the actual, or dynamic, power, there is also moral power; this is a very important word because it alludes to what is attributable to a person, certain qualities, and by which he has influence for good.<a name=87:14></a> The Lord told His disciples
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=88>[Page 88]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		to go into the world to make disciples of all nations.<a name=88:1></a> That alludes to power not only what is called dynamic, but what is called moral, the power of influence with others for good so that disciples are made, "make disciples of all the nations".<a name=88:2></a> Now this word is particularly for young men, but this includes young sisters, too, for when John wrote his epistle to the fathers and young men and the little children he had in mind all, not just the males; he meant all the family.<a name=88:3></a> When he says fathers, he does not exclude the elder sisters; when he says young men, he does not exclude the younger sisters; we know that women have done exploits as men have, according to the Old Testament and the New, too.<a name=88:4></a> And, of course, when he says little children he includes all.<a name=88:5></a> In the first epistle he alludes to all the saints but he has a good deal to say to the young men.<a name=88:6></a> He says, "ye are strong", not 'ye should be'.<a name=88:7></a> I am speaking now of latent strength; the apostle would stress that "ye are strong, and the word of God abides in you" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:14">1 John  2:14</a>).<a name=88:8></a> That is the weapon is first used against oneself, for it is a two-edged sword, and then against others, for one is only effective in the word of God in applying it to others, in the measure in which one applies it to oneself; "the word of God abides in you".<a name=88:9></a> If the word of God abides in one, it means it is restful there; there is nothing to disturb it so to speak.<a name=88:10></a> Hence it indicates a very advanced state if the word of God abides in young men.<a name=88:11></a> Then the apostle goes on to what confirms me in the thought about the girdle on the loins.<a name=88:12></a> The girdles are not always said to be on the loins; in the Revelation they are said to be on the breasts of the Lord Jesus and of certain angels who came out of the temple.<a name=88:13></a> The presence of golden girdles on the breast means that the Lord, or these angels in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#15">Revelation  15</a>, could not carry on their service in the liberty of love but on the principle of judgment.<a name=88:14></a> Here in John's epistle the young men are enjoined not to love the world.<a name=88:15></a> In spite of our strength we are exposed to the world and

	<div class="paragraph">
		the world attacks us, Satan being in it, through our affections.<a name=89:1></a> He says, "love not the world;" that is a love that, I might say, belongs to the lower affections, that which is capable of linking on with what is low morally; so it says, "love not the world, nor the things in the world".<a name=89:2></a> Many a young man, who has developed this quality of being strong and with the word of God abiding in him, enters into marital and household relations and his wife perhaps urges him into certain things that he would not have entered into, or the children are considered and certain things are taken on on their account.<a name=89:3></a> One thing after another comes in and the power weakens, all because of the want of the girdle of leather or skin.<a name=89:4></a> "Love not the world, nor the things in the world.<a name=89:5></a> If any one love the world, the love of the Father is not in him; because all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:15">1 John  2:15</a>, 16).<a name=89:6></a> These are very subtle things.<a name=89:7></a> Think of the pride of life in a brother who at one time had power in his soul; he has got a better house, a better car, everything is increased from that point of view, but the power is lessened.<a name=89:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that is what I had in mind, dear brethren, and John the baptist affords in that illustration a type of this; he was a peculiarly abstemious man, no man more so except perhaps his great prototype, Elijah.<a name=89:9></a> He was in the deserts, we are told, not only desert but deserts, as if he deliberately took up the idea of desert in its variety of meanings, and took on circumstances which would disallow and wither up the flesh; the desert is what negates the flesh.<a name=89:10></a> That is John the baptist, and so we are told that he was here, told what he had on, a leather or skin belt.<a name=89:11></a> Leather I suppose is prepared from skin; the word "leathern" is used in Matthew.<a name=89:12></a> It is skin, only dressed, a material that is of great distinction in the Scriptures, because it is the first material employed for human clothing, God himself having used it to make clothes; so there is a spiritual significance

		alluding obviously to death having preceded in some being.<a name=90:1></a> It would be, in the sense of which I am speaking, the girding of oneself with the witness to the death of Christ; I mean it is a public profession.<a name=90:2></a> In the types referring to leprosy, skins have a place, leprosy may break out in these skins (<a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#13:48">Leviticus  13:48</a>), and so a leathern belt, or girdle, indicates a public profession, but with John the baptist you can see it was a very real thing.<a name=90:3></a> He was girded about the loins with this girdle of skin, it was not on for an ornament.<a name=90:4></a> Girdles are sometimes spoken of in Scripture as used for ornament but this was not for that, it was ornamental in a moral sense, for what can be greater round the loins than what denoted the death of the Lord Jesus.<a name=90:5></a> How sobering, how solemnising that belt would be as looked at at any time!<a name=90:6></a> Accompanying this was the clothing of camel's hair as you will observe, I suppose alluding not exactly to the death of the camel, but to the shearing of the camel, the hair in that sense yielded up in a docile way, in a domesticated way, in the Spirit of Christ.<a name=90:7></a> This clothing has come in in that way and it would surely speak of the creature, what it is, and if there is one thing that marks a camel, it is reserve, latent reserve.<a name=90:8></a> What you can say of a brother who is camel-like is that he has something.<a name=90:9></a> The camel has a reserve supply of water, very important in an arid desert; how much more so, dear brethren, in the arid desert through which we are passing.<a name=90:10></a> We say that brother has something, and his belt is in keeping with it, the question therefore is, can we tap this reserve that he has, for there are those who have things from God and the brethren get no benefit from them.<a name=90:11></a> One of the most painful things that one finds, and one has experienced it considerably, is dumbness in the brothers, inability to take part profitably amongst the brethren; yet we know they have something.<a name=90:12></a>

		J.T.<a name=114:2></a> What I have before me is the "living God" and the features of the truth that stand connected with that appellation of God as seen in the New Testament.<a name=114:3></a> As we look into it we shall see that the subject is extensive, running throughout the New Testament from Matthew to Revelation, and found in the Old Testament too.<a name=114:4></a> Moses uses the title, also Joshua, David, Hezekiah, Jeremiah, Daniel, and Hosea, which is quoted in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#9">Romans  9</a>, besides the Psalms in which it appears several times.<a name=114:5></a> What should be remarked is that it obviously alludes, not to God's eternal relations with men, for the use of the word "living" can have no force when <i>all</i> are living, but it is applied to God largely in contrast to the religious conditions here on earth, and particularly to the deadness as seen in the Jewish system.<a name=114:6></a> Hence it is significantly referred to in Matthew, Hebrews, and in the Revelation.<a name=114:7></a> It has, therefore, a very direct bearing on the present time, when there is so much called religion which has no <i>spiritual life</i>.<a name=114:8></a> To say nothing of paganism and Mohammedanism, and the Eastern church which is characteristically dead.<a name=114:9></a> The great leading religious body in western christendom is marked by death judicially; as the Lord says, "her children will I kill with death" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2:23">Revelation  2:23</a>).<a name=114:10></a> In the Anglican system, the liturgy of which is hundreds of years old with little or no variation, there is no attempt at life.<a name=114:11></a> Without attacking any, the fact is that death, in a spiritual sense, characterises religion generally.<a name=114:12></a> It characterises what is <i>called</i> the christian religion.<a name=114:13></a> So that "the living God" is an appellation that has a very direct bearing now.<a name=114:14></a> To answer to it requires life in our services Godward,

		Another thing which would perhaps help is that the Lord, before this title is introduced in Matthew, inquires as to what men were saying about Him.<a name=115:2></a> That is, what was the current judgment or thought as to who He, the Son of man, was.<a name=115:3></a> The disciples were conversant with what was current at that time.<a name=115:4></a> They themselves had owned that He was the Son of God as the result of certain evidences.<a name=115:5></a> Whatever was in their minds, they spoke of Him as the Son of God in chapter 14; they had the right thought.<a name=115:6></a> They evidently did not have what we have here in chapter 16, for this was a revelation, but <i>generally</i> speaking the Lord was not known at all, although there were those who had certain thoughts about Him.<a name=115:7></a> In no case did <i>men</i> have a right thought about the Lord.<a name=115:8></a> He inquires about this before this great matter of the revelation appears, as if to remind the disciples that inasmuch as men had had abundant evidence of <i>who</i> He was, but did not discern it, it would be of no advantage, but rather the contrary, to tell them, merely as a matter of information.<a name=115:9></a> So that He enjoins them in verse 20 to say to no one that He was the Christ; that is, when there is abundant evidence of what is on God's behalf, and it is not discerned, there is a state disclosed that is reprobate.<a name=115:10></a> There was abundant evidence <i>who</i> He was, but it was not discerned, as shown by the answers the disciples gave the Lord.<a name=115:11></a> That is how it is now.<a name=115:12></a> Today there is abundant evidence as to christianity, but <i>men</i> are not discerning it, and they are not to be merely informed.<a name=115:13></a> The ministry is to have in mind the work of God, and that nothing else will absorb what is of God.<a name=115:14></a>

		J.T.<a name=132:1></a> Most of us will be aware that our subject is "The Living God", as seen in the New Testament, and the features of the truth that stand related to this divine appellation.<a name=132:2></a> In <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:16">Matthew  16:16</a>, Peter is recorded as saying to the Lord, "<i>Thou</i> art the Christ, the Son of the living God".<a name=132:3></a> The object in view in these readings is to stress what should correspond in us on earth, with the living God, namely, a <i>living</i> state of things.<a name=132:4></a> This is in contrast with <i>dead</i> conditions that had marked judaism in our Lord's own time, and now marks the profession of christianity.<a name=132:5></a> Instead of the energy of the Spirit of God, we have forms and ceremonies.<a name=132:6></a> The passage in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#9">Romans  9</a>speaks of the "Sons of the living God".<a name=132:7></a> It is quoted from the prophet Hosea, and shows how quickly the change takes place, from being a cast-off people, to being in the relationship of "Sons of the living God".<a name=132:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the order of the truth, we should now consider the <i>Spirit</i> of the living God, for it is through the Spirit that the answer to the living God is realised.<a name=132:9></a> All that is effected subjectively here is by the Spirit, so that <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#3">2 Corinthians  3</a>furnishes a convenient passage to dwell on as to that side of the truth.<a name=132:10></a> Linking this with sonship in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#9">Romans  9</a>-- "Sons of the living God" -- we reach service in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9">Hebrews  9</a>.<a name=132:11></a> The word 'service' there may be translated worship, and refers generally to the official or public service Godward.<a name=132:12></a> It is not the idea of serving men, but God, as <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3:3">Philippians  3:3</a>.<a name=132:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we have to view the cities in which we are from these angles.<a name=178:2></a> First, what they are in relation to evil.<a name=178:3></a> The peculiar kind of power there is in the concentration of humanity in a regularised community.<a name=178:4></a> All that is capable of attracting the human heart and gripping it, is found, from the standpoint of evil, in the cities.<a name=178:5></a> We do well to bear this in mind.<a name=178:6></a> It ought to enter into our prayers.<a name=178:7></a> The cities of the world seem to be the special places for the development of evil; as we see in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#8">Luke  8</a>, the man came <i>out of the city</i> having the legion of demons.<a name=178:8></a> Decapolis means the place of ten cities.<a name=178:9></a> It is the concentration of evil in an organised way.<a name=178:10></a> On the other hand, in spite of that, it is wonderful to see, as one moves about the world, how the young people, and old, too, are being delivered and kept, an exhibition in these latter days of the intervention of God, His power for salvation, as Paul said, "that <i>they</i> also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:10">2 Timothy  2:10</a>).<a name=178:11></a> It is the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, giving the saints another status, and attached to it is the wonderful thought of glory.<a name=178:12></a> I believe we can see it; the idea of salvation in the young and the old, and the glory, in a moral sense, shining.<a name=178:13></a> That is a great thing; to have the glory shining in our salvation.<a name=178:14></a> That is a principle with God from the outset, as to His people viewed collectively, that the glory comes in and shines.<a name=178:15></a> Both in regard to the tabernacle and the temple, God comes in and takes charge of it all, God being pleased with His people as in their places in the assembly.<a name=178:16></a>

		Now the final thing is the city, not only <i>of God</i>, but "the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem".<a name=179:11></a> It is a full title of what God has in His mind in regard of a city.<a name=179:12></a> We have much of it throughout the Old Testament, but this description is very beautiful and stirring.<a name=179:13></a> This is one of the eight items given in this list to which we, as christians, have come.<a name=179:14></a> One could say a good deal about each of them, but I am just speaking about this one item, coming in after Zion; "the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem".<a name=179:15></a> We have <i>come</i> to that.<a name=179:16></a> The epistle to the Hebrews does not go into the things it speaks of in the concrete working out of them, as is seen in other scriptures.<a name=179:17></a> The state of the saints was very low, and what was in mind was to interest them in the greatness of what they had come to.<a name=179:18></a> It was for them to work out the significance of each of these eight items.<a name=179:19></a> They had very largely lost the power of them, and they are reminded of what they had come to, and my thought

		is, not to speak of it in the objective sense only, in which it is spoken of here, but as having part in it, because in truth the saints to whom the epistle was addressed were part of the city.<a name=180:1></a> Every true christian is part of this.<a name=180:2></a> The book of Revelation opens it up to us in a striking manner, but this is the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and I refer to it on the side of our having part in it.<a name=180:3></a> Not only that we have come to it -- the feeblest christian may have come to it; but how blessed to have part in it!<a name=180:4></a> It is a matter of spiritual experience.<a name=180:5></a> Most of us have an idea of it, and it is being worked out, I believe, throughout the world, and it is a testimony; that is the idea of administration carried on in a heavenly way, and not only in a heavenly way, but in a living way.<a name=180:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is available to us what is represented in this idea of what we have come to as christians, and of what is workable in the way of carrying out the mind of God in government and order.<a name=180:7></a> It has to be taken up now, in an abstract way, but inasmuch as there are two or three or more who understand it, it is workable.<a name=180:8></a> I believe if there is one thing more than another that the Lord is stressing, it is that the dispensation should be carried on to the finish, to end up in some sense as it began, that is, in a living way, and in a heavenly way, and especially in regard to our administrative matters.<a name=180:9></a> We are so prone to borrow from our own thoughts or from the world's way in these things.<a name=180:10></a> Government is greatly stressed amongst the nations.<a name=180:11></a> I am speaking now of ordinary government as it is today.<a name=180:12></a> Never was so much money spent on government in the history of the world as is done today; the extraordinary expense of government is noticeable everywhere, but then God would meet that in <i>His</i> way, in a heavenly way.<a name=180:13></a> So in regard of administration, one of the first things you get in reference to the assembly convened in its public bearing is that the brethren were saying, "The Lord is indeed risen and has

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These are two great public factors, the principle of grace and the Lord's supper.<a name=181:3></a> How can we go on together, how can we carry on the idea of the heavenly city aside from the supply of grace; grace reigning through righteousness; and, on the other hand, the constant recalling of Jesus, of our Head in heaven; constantly being reminded of Him in the memorial that He has left us?<a name=181:4></a> These two things run together publicly, and every one of us should see to them; should see that grace reigns through righteousness, and that there is a place for the Lord to come in and out, bringing in heavenly freshness and power constantly, so that every bit of administrative activity is governed by these things.<a name=181:5></a> If it were a question of choosing an apostle, it must be one that "assembled with us all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us, beginning from the baptism of John until the day in which he was taken up" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:21">Acts  1:21</a>, 22).<a name=181:6></a> It is in that way you get the thought of the living God carried on practically, the city of the living God.<a name=181:7></a> Life is expressed in the Lord coming in and out amongst us.<a name=181:8></a> Of course, it is expressed by the Spirit.<a name=181:9></a> The Spirit is life, but things are never to be on the principle of judaism -- that is, on the principle of demand without supply.<a name=181:10></a> It is a living and heavenly state of things.<a name=181:11></a> It is the idea of the reflex of what is in heaven in the way of government that has to be carried out here on earth.<a name=181:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in view of all that, the other side is, that if I am in this city, my responsibility is to observe that the Lord has placed me here under these conditions.<a name=181:13></a> He has placed His authority here and so He says to Saul, who was subsequently to work it out more than anyone, "go into the city, and it shall be told thee what

		In John's gospel, which, I believe is, among many other things, intended to instruct us as to this, we have the Lord presented incarnate, and so in sonship in chapter 1: 14 "the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us (and we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father);" that is, He is presented immediately as with the Father.<a name=185:5></a> In chapter 11, He speaks in the audience of others to the Father, and says, "Father" -- He speaks thus because of those that heard, those that stood by, indicating that His audible speaking to His Father had in mind the instruction of others.<a name=185:6></a> Again in chapter 12, He speaks to His Father, and there is the answer from heaven.<a name=185:7></a> Then in chapter 17, He addresses the Father formally, lifting up His eyes to heaven.<a name=185:8></a> This was evidently in the audience of His disciples, because He says, "they are not of the world;" that is to say, they were nearby.<a name=185:9></a> The thought, I believe, is to draw us to the side of the Lord in a spiritual sense, especially as <i>in assembly</i>.<a name=185:10></a> He would draw us to His side so that we may apprehend the current of His feelings and His affections, and what His God was to Him.<a name=185:11></a>

		This would lead us to have part in what was before Him, especially in our service Godward.<a name=186:1></a> So that the instruction peculiar to John in these chapters, is not only as to the Lord going to the Father, but it says also that He came from God and went to God.<a name=186:2></a> That would be God in the sense in which He knew Him.<a name=186:3></a> In view of all this instruction in these chapters in John, His message to the disciples is the more significant, because He sent the message before He came in amongst them.<a name=186:4></a> In John's account they are not said to have been saying anything as He came in amongst them.<a name=186:5></a> In Luke's account they are said to have been saying certain things, but not in John's.<a name=186:6></a> The thought is that the wonderful message they had received had affected them, and they would think of the Lord in that way.<a name=186:7></a> He had sent a message that He was ascending to His Father, and theirs, His God and theirs, and that would be in their minds.<a name=186:8></a> It was intended to be in their minds, and it is revived in His word to the overcomer in Philadelphia.<a name=186:9></a> That assembly, the last but one addressed in Revelation, is especially before the Lord as having remnant features, and the overcomer would have intelligence as to the reward promised.<a name=186:10></a> Those who loved Him would value what He brought before them.<a name=186:11></a> So He brings in this term four times in the verse we read: "the temple of my God .<a name=186:12></a>.<a name=186:13></a>.<a name=186:14></a> the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven, from my God".<a name=186:15></a> It is manifest that He has in mind that this thought which He sought to impress upon the disciples at the beginning has been revived.<a name=186:16></a> The purpose of our meeting now, is that we might have it in our minds as the supreme thought in the service of God -- our service in the assembly.<a name=186:17></a>

		Jesus in the most touching and beautiful manner.<a name=215:1></a> The most profound feelings we get of our Lord Jesus are voiced in the book of Psalms, and so here we have one who knew something about the heavens, for it is, as you will observe, a psalm of David.<a name=215:2></a> I suppose he had weighed over the accounts Scripture gives of the heavens, for the relation between the book of Psalms and the heavens is very strong.<a name=215:3></a> It is said in the scripture that God by His Spirit garnished the heavens, and that God in a vision took out Abraham and caused him to look up to the heavens, and asked him if he could count the stars.<a name=215:4></a> They are all called by name.<a name=215:5></a> David is really more concerned about the heavens than about the earth, whereas with Solomon it is more the earth.<a name=215:6></a>

		David here attributes heat to the sun, and speaks of it in terms that can only have reference to Christ.<a name=215:7></a> He says, "In them hath he set a tent for the sun".<a name=215:8></a> Had Peter thought of this, he would not have proposed a tabernacle for Moses alongside of Jesus.<a name=215:9></a> That there should be a tabernacle for Moses in the heavens is utterly contrary to any spiritual mind, but that there should be one for Jesus is perfectly intelligible.<a name=215:10></a> He comes forth, the psalm says, "as a bridegroom".<a name=215:11></a> Who can fail to think of the warmth that enters into that thought?<a name=215:12></a> And then: "rejoiceth as a strong man to run the race".<a name=215:13></a> We have surely, wrapped up in these wonderful words, an allusion to the Lord Jesus in His affections, in the warmth of His affections for us in this cold world.<a name=215:14></a> He knows how chilly it is, how frigid indeed it may be, as the devil, who is the god of it, turns his winds against us, but this psalm says as to the sun that, "there is nothing hid from the heat thereof".<a name=215:15></a> I suppose those of us who live in the temperate zones value heat more than others.<a name=215:16></a> I have no doubt that christianity flourishes best in those zones, for even physical conditions are used of God to help us.<a name=215:17></a> I doubt if there is anything in our environment, as God has

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, to follow that up, I want to speak to you from the book of Ecclesiastes, which is from Solomon.<a name=217:3></a> He speaks of heat in persons, and obviously it links on very instructively with the psalm; what comes down from Christ is radiated.<a name=217:4></a> There is the idea of radiation, not at a distance, but in two lying together; "how can one alone be warm?<a name=217:5></a>" is the inquiry.<a name=217:6></a> There may be those here who have left the place of spiritual heat, but the wise man says, "how can one alone be warm?<a name=217:7></a>" It is for you to answer.<a name=217:8></a> Were you to tell the truth, you would own that since you left you have hardly had any warmth at all.<a name=217:9></a> The Lord has a word for you here.<a name=217:10></a> The passage also says, "if two lie together, then they have warmth".<a name=217:11></a> Such is our constitution.<a name=217:12></a> The whole passage bears on brethren seeking one another, as if to say, We cannot get along without the brethren.<a name=217:13></a> You say, The Lord Jesus is enough for me.<a name=217:14></a> Well, He would say to you, Do not forget the brethren.<a name=217:15></a> I never intended you to be in isolation; I have made provision for you; I have provided the brethren for you.<a name=217:16></a> They are available for you and with them you shall have heat.<a name=217:17></a> Have you not found that you do not get warm spiritually in your isolation?<a name=217:18></a> Yet among the saints you get warm.<a name=217:19></a> The Lord would have us honour one another.<a name=217:20></a> We may be in the same meeting, and breaking bread as we say, and yet not really lying together, for our fellowship, dear brethren, becomes with many just theory, whereas the terms are divinely intended to be carried out in accordance with their meaning, and not only the idea of "lying together", but that we belong to <i>an organism</i>, for a body is the figure used.<a name=217:21></a> Such is the inter-dependency of the saints on one another, that the striking figure of the human body itself is employed to show our relations with one another.<a name=217:22></a>

		The obvious point in Solomon's remark here is that isolated brethren should not remain so.<a name=218:1></a> The Lord has provided the brethren in whom there is spiritual heat, and it is for you to get as close to them as possible.<a name=218:2></a> To make clear what this means, I read in 2 Kings, which affords us a figure of a young person who has become spiritually dead.<a name=218:3></a> The coldness of death was there, but happily there is a mother who feels the calamity, which would by extension suggest the mother feelings of the saints for one who is thus affected.<a name=218:4></a> It is a question of his <i>head</i>.<a name=218:5></a> The chapter is full of instruction, but the mother laid him where he was most likely to get help.<a name=218:6></a> She laid him on the prophet's bed, the man through whom God had promised her the child.<a name=218:7></a> The Lord had given, and the Lord had taken away, and she turned to the man of God.<a name=218:8></a> She took a long journey to reach him, but found him.<a name=218:9></a> She would have no one else, no one but Elisha, not even his staff.<a name=218:10></a> She would have the prophet, and he returned with her, and went up to the room where the child lay.<a name=218:11></a> This is the moment, dear brethren, of recovery for these cases, and there are many like it.<a name=218:12></a> Elisha completely identified himself with the boy -- his eyes, his mouth, and his hands.<a name=218:13></a> It is a question now not only of his head, but of his whole body, because the whole body has to be of divine use, not only the head.<a name=218:14></a> Some of us would assume that it is only the head, but it is every member.<a name=218:15></a> Our members are to be instruments of righteousness to God, and Elisha had the divine thought in mind for this boy.<a name=218:16></a> He is to be restored, but restored in all his members, not only in his intellect, but his hands, his eyes, and his mouth, and then the prophet <i>bent</i> over him, that is, deep exercise.<a name=218:17></a> If there are persons to be recovered from spiritual death, the Lord looks for this.<a name=218:18></a> He has gone all the way Himself, entering into death, so that we might live, and so Elisha, in this performance, remarkable as it is, and full of instruction, brought

		It is a great matter that God acts, not yet for the overthrow of evil universally, but for the overthrow of it in the measure in which it impedes the progress of His work; so Matthew enlarges on the evil.<a name=225:7></a> As remarked, it was in two persons, not in one, as Mark and Luke give it; for two would suggest organisation, and organised evil is the more powerful and effective.<a name=225:8></a> Matthew tells us that the two were possessed of demons, and they were so fierce that no one could pass <i>that way</i>.<a name=225:9></a> That is a particular point noted.<a name=225:10></a> The rights of heaven were challenged, for all power is given to Christ in heaven and on earth, and any position occupied by evil that interferes with what is in His mind must be dealt with.<a name=225:11></a> What He has in mind must go on; in Matthew He has the assembly in mind, and the development of it, so that any condition arising in a locality that hinders right principles, that prevents them being operative, must be dealt with.<a name=225:12></a> The Lord has to do with that constantly.<a name=225:13></a> Alas, that conditions locally in many gatherings should interfere with the operation of divine principles.<a name=225:14></a>

Athaliah's aim was to destroy the seed royal; that was what was in her mind and she thought she had succeeded, but she had not. God was watchful, as He ever is, over the testimony, and had, in the king's sister, Jehosheba, a servant to protect the seed royal. The position is very apparent; these circumstances spiritually are apparent at the present time. That is to say, a woman ruling without any sense of obligation to a man. Her aim was to destroy every one who might have any right to challenge her position of rule. We know who says, "I sit a queen, and I am not a widow; and I shall in no wise see grief" (@Revelation  18:7</a>).<a name=240:7></a> She asserts her own rights, demanding to be heard, claiming to be a queen, and her aim is to destroy all the seed royal, that is, all who in any sense could represent the divine thought in rule.<a name=240:8></a> Earlier, this same thing that I am speaking of, as existing today, is typified in another woman, that is, Jezebel.<a name=240:9></a> Her thought was to destroy the <i>prophets</i>, that is to say, to cut off the prophetic ministry of the Spirit.<a name=240:10></a> These are the two great efforts of the false system which these women represent, and it has succeeded to an enormous extent, but not entirely.<a name=240:11></a> In these last days particularly, God has intervened and has asserted the rights of the seed royal.<a name=240:12></a> We see how the seed royal is developed in the gospel of Matthew, and we do well, as having come into the light of the assembly and the rule that is

		J.T.<a name=255:1></a> Quite so.<a name=255:2></a> The teaching of Romans is in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#15">Genesis  15</a>, but chapter 17 is the teaching of Colossians, and of Ephesians up to a point, though particularly Colossians.<a name=255:3></a> "Circumcised with circumcision not done by hand, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of the Christ" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:11">Colossians  2:11</a>).<a name=255:4></a> So that you find in chapter 17, that God enters into covenant with him, and He says to him, "It is I".<a name=255:5></a> In verse 3 we read, "and God talked with him, saying, It is I".<a name=255:6></a> Then God proceeds to speak to him of the covenant.<a name=255:7></a> You will see that God, speaking reverently, is the one party and Abraham is the other.<a name=255:8></a> He is coming on to familiar lines with the believer.<a name=255:9></a> God gives us to understand that He is dealing with us on personal, familiar lines; and He enters into covenant with Abraham, and changes his name.<a name=255:10></a> He changes Sarah's name also, and says in effect, I will bring you into the nobility and status that is proper to the believer in relation to heavenly things.<a name=255:11></a> He finished speaking to Abraham, as you will observe in verse 22; "he left off talking with him; and God went up from Abraham".<a name=255:12></a> Think of that, the Creator of the universe speaking to a man, speaking to him, as it were, on equal terms.<a name=255:13></a> He says, "It is I", and when He finishes the conversation he goes up <i>from Abraham</i>.<a name=255:14></a> Think of the dignity of the believer -- "from Abraham".<a name=255:15></a> What does Abraham do?<a name=255:16></a> He is left to himself.<a name=255:17></a> He orders circumcision in his house, and that brings out the state of things seen in this chapter.<a name=255:18></a> The divine word is carried out to the letter, and God honours that.<a name=255:19></a>

		J.T.<a name=279:1></a> That what is in mind in the present inquiry may be clear to all, it may be remarked that our first reading was on <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#18">Genesis  18</a>, attention being drawn to the bearing of the numeral three in testimony, as suggestive of the <i>whole</i> testimony in regard to any given subject.<a name=279:2></a> God has given full testimony so that there should be no doubt in our minds as to the meaning of what He is presenting.<a name=279:3></a> In that chapter we have three men, as it is said, "standing near" to Abraham as he was at his tent door.<a name=279:4></a> In that incident there is the indication of the Deity, the Trinity; God coming in in that way in an economy.<a name=279:5></a> One of the three is recognised by Abraham as the Lord, but subsequently he speaks to the three together, he addresses them collectively, and they answered in the same way.<a name=279:6></a>

		Then yesterday we dwelt on chapter 24 as presenting the leading patriarchal thought in Abraham.<a name=279:7></a> He is occupied as a father with Isaac, and with a view to the bride for Isaac.<a name=279:8></a> What was mainly in mind was to show that in the economy into which God has come, the Father takes prominence, as it is said, "to us there is one God, the Father".<a name=279:9></a> The Son and the Spirit also have part in the Deity, but take a subservient place in order to carry out the divine thoughts and make them effectual.<a name=279:10></a> It was remarked that Abraham represents the Father's activities in relation to Christ and the assembly.<a name=279:11></a> It was urgent, but the idea of the "oath" is added, requiring that his servant must not take his son Isaac out of Canaan, but that the bride must be sought and brought to Isaac into Canaan.<a name=279:12></a> What was stressed was that Canaan represents the hidden side of the position; Abraham being seen as presenting figuratively the God of the heavens and of the earth, but that Christ, from

	<div class="paragraph">
		the point of view of the truth presented there, is to be regarded as in heaven, as indigenous to heaven and, as there expressive of the divine counsels for Man.<a name=280:1></a> Then the saints as the assembly are brought to Him in the power of the Spirit, in mind and affection answering to the position He is in.<a name=280:2></a> Then, as Isaac led Rebecca into his mother's tent, and loved her, he is to be taken account of thus as representing a testimony, namely, of the One who has a wife here, who is subservient to Him in whatever is needed on earth; that is, of course, Christ and the assembly.<a name=280:3></a> That is the substance of what we had yesterday.<a name=280:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we have to consider the patriarchal teaching as seen in Isaac.<a name=280:5></a> It will be observed that in the last scripture read, the idea is cumulative.<a name=280:6></a> Jacob says in blessing Ephraim and Manasseh (verse 16), "and let my name be named upon them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac".<a name=280:7></a> So that the patriarchal instruction from Abraham to Jacob is cumulative, and all comes down in the blessing of Ephraim and Manasseh.<a name=280:8></a> The suggestion now is to consider Isaac, as to what feature of the fatherhood of God is typically set out in this patriarch.<a name=280:9></a> In this connection what has been stated in the New Testament is that "Isaac blessed".<a name=280:10></a> "By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:20">Hebrews  11:20</a>).<a name=280:11></a> I thought <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#27">Genesis  27</a>should be considered a little, before we proceed with the other passages, as indicating certain features of fatherly activities, not, as in chapter 24, to procure a bride for a heavenly Christ, but to convey blessing.<a name=280:12></a> For blessing is imparted to the two brothers, although the element of love between them was absent.<a name=280:13></a> The suggestion is what God is in grace in our dispensation, seen in blessing, notwithstanding the incongruity, in the absence of love, as if the blessing might induce what was lacking; that the influence of the Father might work thus, for the Father's name stands only in connection with grace and love, not with judgment (<a href="../bible/John.htm#5:22">John  5:22</a>).<a name=280:14></a>

		Another thing that comes out in chapter 27 is the energy seen in the object of counsel; for it is in this connection that we have that remarkable statement in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#9:11">Romans  9:11</a>, 12, that the principle of election must stand, that all must make way for the establishment of the principle of election.<a name=281:1></a> So we have the energy of faith, although the circumstances were not in keeping, yet the energy of faith secured the blessing.<a name=281:2></a> Another great point to consider is the presence of hatred, a brother's hatred; suggesting, as we might say, the difficulties of natural relationship, for very great difficulties indeed, in the things of God, arise from natural relationships, which often hinder us.<a name=281:3></a> We have in this chapter the energy that secures the blessing in spite of that hindrance.<a name=281:4></a>

		Another important item in the subject of ministry is that in chapter 12, where Jehovah gives at length the instruction relative to the passover, Moses <i>epitomises</i> it in telling the message to the people; suggestive of brevity in ministry, that in serving we should be regulated by wisdom, by what people are able to take in, and present what is sufficient.<a name=312:7></a> In this instance the minister secures that the people worship God.<a name=312:8></a> In chapter 15 we have the song of Moses and the children of Israel, the first song indeed that we have in Scripture, and Miriam rendering her peculiar service, appears at the end, for "Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took the tambour in her hand, and all the women went out after her with tambours and with dances".<a name=312:9></a> Miriam, added to Moses and Aaron, comes

		J.T.<a name=313:5></a> I thought it was to bring out the <i>depth</i> of the work at that time.<a name=313:6></a> A ministry may be very effective on account of its power, but we have to measure the results of it, what it effects, and it seems as if Miriam's service here affected the women in Israel, bringing them into the current of praise.<a name=313:7></a>

		Now the subject before us for the time left is the inheritance, which comes in in order after the ministry, for the ministry has in mind that the saints should take up their inheritance.<a name=316:3></a> That means that we have not only left Egypt, but have another world opened up to us; so that what is needed now is leadership into that world, and Joshua represents that.<a name=316:4></a> He is the leader into the inheritance, so that he is introduced to us, in view of this service, as "a man in whom is the Spirit".<a name=316:5></a> That is what is to be noted in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#27:16">Numbers  27:16</a>, 17.<a name=316:6></a> Moses says to Jehovah, "Let Jehovah, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the assembly, who may go out before them, and who may come in before them, and who may lead them out, and who may bring them in, that the assembly of Jehovah be not as sheep that have no shepherd".<a name=316:7></a> Moses alludes to the spiritual side, he addresses Jehovah as the God of the <i>spirits</i> of all flesh.<a name=316:8></a> Our entrance into the inheritance now is not an external, but a spiritual matter.<a name=316:9></a>

		The word "together" being in these scriptures is initially why I read them.<a name=328:1></a> It is a word that characterises christianity, characterises the saints as here in the absence of Christ, and will characterise them eternally, for it is said that we are raised up together and made to sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus.<a name=328:2></a> Underlying it is love, and it is this that gives lustre to it as seen in christians, as over against the application of this word to men in the world.<a name=328:3></a> In the gospels we have instances of men being together in hatred of Christ, murder in their hearts.<a name=328:4></a> Such assemblies set out the power of the world, for organised opposition is the most potent and virulent.<a name=328:5></a> We read of the assembly of the wicked surrounding our Lord Jesus in His closing moments here in flesh.<a name=328:6></a> Evil took this form as if to shut out every possible way of escape so that their design should be accomplished.<a name=328:7></a> In no part of human history was evil so concentrated and virulent as at that time.<a name=328:8></a> It was a combined effort of the devil, his agencies being arrayed militarily so as to shut off all possible escape, as they thought.<a name=328:9></a> It appears as though, as they reached their end, that the outlet from them was unexpected, and in it their end was judicially complete, not yet outwardly, but nevertheless in truth.<a name=328:10></a> The resurrection of Christ, for He is heard from the horns of the unicorn, was the answer to that combination of evil.<a name=328:11></a>

		to their assembling during the Lord's lifetime here, speaks of the men who have "assembled with us all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:21">Acts  1:21</a>).<a name=329:1></a> The Lord inaugurated that great thought of assembling, or gathering together; that is, not only that we come together actually, but that we are together as being led together.<a name=329:2></a> There is also the idea of being assembled, as being convened by One who has authority to do so, so that the matter has a great place in the Scriptures and in the testimony of God.<a name=329:3></a> It involves great privileges and enjoyment spiritually during the period of the absence of Christ from this world, affording to Him opportunity of coming in and going out amongst us in a spiritual way, so that we might know Him and how He assembles with us as our Head.<a name=329:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I begin with these remarks and allude for a moment to the well-known <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#133:1">Psalm  133:1</a>, which speaks of "how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!<a name=329:5></a>" The idea is very strongly expressed in the early chapters of the Acts from which we have read.<a name=329:6></a> I read chapter 2: 44, not because it presents the thought first, but because it gives the idea of being together as to the attitude of our minds towards one another and the longing of our hearts to one another, even though we may not be actually together.<a name=329:7></a> We are told there that "all that believed were together, and had all things common".<a name=329:8></a> It does not say here that they were together in one place.<a name=329:9></a> The allusion is to the attitude of their hearts and minds in regard to one another, that as the opportunity offered, and it was physically convenient for them, they were together whether in small or large numbers.<a name=329:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is the first point I would dwell upon, and without the understanding of it, the coming together by appointment and for a purpose is not likely to be what it should be.<a name=329:11></a> So in chapter 1 we have the idea of the brethren staying in a certain place -- the upper

		room.<a name=330:1></a> The suggestion is that they were <i>morally</i> elevated that they were abiding in quarters free from ordinary religious influences.<a name=330:2></a> That is how the matter stands in chapter 1.<a name=330:3></a> Those who had seen the Lord Jesus ascend into heaven returned to Jerusalem and went to the <i>upper room</i>.<a name=330:4></a> His disciples were loyal and instinctively free from what was current religiously, and we are told the names of the persons in the upper room.<a name=330:5></a> Then the Spirit of God proceeds to tell us about Peter standing up in the midst of the brethren, and that the crowd of names who were together was about a hundred and twenty.<a name=330:6></a> The word <i>crowd</i> is used, that is, they did not come together for a specific purpose, nor were they led into a position, but they were in it and each with a distinction; a point that is of great importance in christianity.<a name=330:7></a> For in truth every one has his distinction, and his distinction saves him from rivalry and envy.<a name=330:8></a> Hence christians are marked off in this informal way in the divine narrative in the book of Acts, so that each one should understand that he stands on his own feet in relation to God and before his brethren, and he is no more and no less than God has made him.<a name=330:9></a> That idea will run through eternally, we shall certainly not be any more nor any less than God has made us, and that will be the distinctiveness of each and every one who will then shine, each in his own glory.<a name=330:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we find in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:1">Acts  2:1</a> that the saints "were all together in one place".<a name=330:11></a> The point is not that the one hundred and twenty were there, but they were <i>all</i> there, and heaven took account of that.<a name=330:12></a> It is characteristic, the formation of the assembly being in view, and heaven pleased with the scene.<a name=330:13></a> It is the divine way to take account of what <i>is</i>.<a name=330:14></a> I mean there is no thought up there of adding to or subtracting from what is.<a name=330:15></a> However large or small the number, heaven takes account of it as it is.<a name=330:16></a>

		Well now, I want to go on to 1 Corinthians to show how the christians began to come together for a specific purpose.<a name=332:1></a> I wish to go over the ground with you in these chapters; this section of the first epistle and also <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20">Acts  20</a>, bring out how, under the Spirit of God, the apostle Paul peculiarly sets out this great thought of coming together.<a name=332:2></a> In Corinthians he is concerned about the order of it, and in the Acts the Spirit of God is concerned that in the coming together to break bread, the whole range of divine thoughts in the ministry of the apostle Paul should be in view.<a name=332:3></a> What a vista opens up to us therefore as we understand what <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20:7">Acts  20:7</a> implies!<a name=332:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I speak first of all about <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11">1 Corinthians  11</a>, and what you find is that added to the word <i>together</i> is the word <i>assembly</i> -- "when ye come together in assembly".<a name=332:5></a> Now we have an added thought and one which I hope by the Lord's help to make clear, but at any rate it is well to have it before us; it is an added thought to what I have been speaking of already.<a name=332:6></a> We have the word <i>assembly</i> in Acts, alluding to persons called out, and it is added to the thought of gathering together in this epistle in order to set out the proper position, environment, and order for the Lord's supper.<a name=332:7></a> It is not only that saints are together, even though we are together in love -- that is really the only way to be together -- but not only are we together in love according to this chapter, but "<i>together in assembly</i>".<a name=332:8></a> The thought of the assembly is added to it, and that gives a lustre to the position that we have not had as yet in the divine narrative.<a name=332:9></a> It is true that it has had to be brought in by the apostle in a corrective way.<a name=332:10></a> The conditions he is dealing with are distressing in the extreme, that brethren were coming together ostensibly in assembly and carrying in their hearts party feelings, personal bias -- a most distressing situation, but the apostle nevertheless uses this word.<a name=332:11></a> He says in effect, at least inferentially, that it <i>should</i>

		<a name=333>[Page 333]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		be to partake of the Lord's supper.<a name=333:1></a> He does not say, When you are <i>all together</i> in assembly, and when he speaks in verse 20 of one place, he does not say the <i>whole</i> assembly.<a name=333:2></a> Scripture is wonderfully accurate, and foresees difficulties that would arise; and undoubtedly the carefulness with which the words are chosen in this particular scripture has in mind our present circumstances.<a name=333:3></a> In these last days cities have grown to enormous proportions; sometimes the boundaries are almost indefinable, taxing the wisdom of the brethren, taxing their patience, taxing their love.<a name=333:4></a> Yet this scripture is so carefully worded that though we may have any given number of subdivisions in the assembly in a city, the truth is workable.<a name=333:5></a> For the words are chosen in such wise as to convey what is characteristic, not what is specific.<a name=333:6></a> That is to say, "when ye come together <i>in assembly</i>", may mean a dozen or twice that number, or fifty or a hundred; it is not the number but the <i>character</i> of the thing.<a name=333:7></a> It does not necessarily include all the saints in the city, but the character of the thing is in view; and even if it be in one place, the same thing holds, it is the character of the thing, not the totality of the saints in a city -- the Spirit of God reserves that word for chapter 14.<a name=333:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We must never forget the unity of the assembly in the city; it is not a matter of a confederation of meetings, it is one assembly in the city; and that idea of oneness should appear as often as possible.<a name=333:9></a> I come to that in a moment.<a name=333:10></a> I want to dwell now on this characteristic idea of coming together <i>in assembly</i>, and how it brings into mind not only that we love one another, but that we understand the position.<a name=333:11></a> The idea of being together in love underlies it; unless we have that we shall never understand the idea of coming together in assembly.<a name=333:12></a> For the coming together in assembly may tax our patience, and unless we have love, our patience will give way, and we shall lose the power of sitting together.<a name=333:13></a> "Love never fails", and certainly that word

		applies when we are together in assembly, and have the precious emblems of the Lord's death before us, and all that enters into such a service.<a name=334:1></a> We certainly require love, love amongst ourselves, that which never fails, if the divine thought in the position is to be realised.<a name=334:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So you have the word <i>assembly</i>, and in the introduction to this subject you have the word <i>intelligent</i>, "I speak as to intelligent persons", that we may he able to sit together in the exercise of affection, not simply sit, but in the exercise of affection, so that I am able to clothe the brethren inwardly with affectionate thoughts, and every moment of the time is a matter of enjoyment; it is preparatory to our eternal relations, to our eternal portion.<a name=334:3></a> There shall be nothing else, dear brethren, but continual enjoyment, enjoyment of divine love, enjoyment of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, and the enjoyment of the brethren.<a name=334:4></a> Let us not think otherwise than that the presence of the brethren in heaven will add to our enjoyment; and not only does it add to the enjoyment, but it adds to the divine enjoyment.<a name=334:5></a> That is the great thought in divine purpose, that God is to have enjoyment in His people, and we are being educated for that now; hence the necessity of love, the bond of perfectness.<a name=334:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The introduction of the covenant in the Supper, which the Spirit never fails to stress, is to carry into our hearts the bond of perfectness, and when is perfectness more necessary than when the idea of an organism is present?<a name=334:7></a> It is a question of love in the power of the Spirit; so that you have the idea of faith in the verse in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>-- "all that believed".<a name=334:8></a> Believing is a fundamental idea, but love <i>draws</i> the saints together, "all that believed were together;" it is faith working by love, and what joy when the Spirit of God brings the new covenant home to us as we are sitting together in assembly!<a name=334:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How great is this!<a name=335:10></a> -- and one would seek to rest on it for a moment -- and how great is this matter that here are saints, intelligent men amongst them, besides the apostle -- some names given which indicate great spiritual wealth and intelligence, and yet they do not proceed with what they came to do.<a name=335:11></a> One may inquire, Is that an example for us?<a name=335:12></a> We are to understand every passage in its own setting.<a name=335:13></a> Whilst we may have considerable intelligence, considerable spiritual wealth, and love among ourselves, while we

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the setting here is marked by love; the chapter is full of affection.<a name=336:9></a> <i>Paul</i>, you may say, is written over it from beginning to end.<a name=336:10></a> Not that the Spirit of God would occupy us with any person rather than Christ, but He would occupy us with the ministry -- the ministry of this great servant, lest it should be overlooked or ignored; lest we should be proceeding with the Lord's supper without the fulness of the setting proper to it.<a name=336:11></a> That is what I had in mind as to this chapter.<a name=336:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So that the coming together in assembly should take on what is divinely intended, not only for ourselves but for God.<a name=336:13></a> As the Lord said in <a href="../bible/John.htm#15:26">John  15:26</a>, "the Comforter .<a name=336:14></a>.<a name=336:15></a>.<a name=336:16></a> whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who goes forth from with the Father;" a remarkable expression, who "goes forth from with the Father; <i>he</i> shall bear witness concerning me".<a name=336:17></a> The Lord had in His mind that the Spirit, coming out, as it were, with first-hand knowledge of all

		I have in mind, dear brethren, to speak of suffering this evening, and have read these scriptures for this reason, and also because they show that suffering for Christ now, results in His association with us in sufferings, and then our association with Him.<a name=350:1></a> Sufferings have a great place in the mind of heaven; sufferings down here.<a name=350:2></a> This has been so from the very outset, since the beginning of the occasion of it, that is, the presence of sin among men.<a name=350:3></a> The history of suffering is stressed throughout the divine narrative, and the object of this meeting is to encourage us to accept that it has a definite and designed place in relation to God's people at this particular time, as ever.<a name=350:4></a> The prophets of old, we are told by Peter, testified of the sufferings of Christ; "testifying before of the sufferings which belonged to Christ, and the glories after these" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:11">1 Peter  1:11</a>).<a name=350:5></a>

		These sufferings are held out to us, particularly in the New Testament, as a consequence of our loyalty to Christ, and hence as a privilege; as indeed what is essential to formation, and to lustre of character, conforming us to Christ.<a name=350:6></a> For it is said, "it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make perfect the leader of their salvation through sufferings" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:10">Hebrews  2:10</a>).<a name=350:7></a> And so the great servant who was called out to convey the truth to us gentiles, is introduced to us by the Lord who called him and furnished him in this connection.<a name=350:8></a> Ananias is told by the Lord, "<i>I</i> will shew to him how much he must suffer for my name" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:16">Acts  9:16</a>).<a name=350:9></a> What he suffered is partially recorded in Scripture, reluctantly, by himself, but not all his sufferings.<a name=350:10></a> What is recorded is sufficient to show the truth of the Lord's prophetic announcement, and these sufferings add great lustre to him as a minister, and commendation to what he ministered; and

	<div class="paragraph">
		Timotheus is enjoined to take his share in sufferings, and I have selected first of all the well-known chapter in the prophet Daniel as illustrative of the sufferings of the saints, and how the Son of God -- for that is what is presented -- becomes identified with us in these sufferings.<a name=351:5></a> An honour beyond words to convey, that the Son of God should identify Himself with us in our taking our share of sufferings, "because to you has been given, as regards Christ, not only the believing on him but the suffering for him also" (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#1:29">Philippians  1:29</a>).<a name=351:6></a> This chapter has peculiar significance in these last days, when the authorities -- those for whom indeed we pray and are enjoined to pray -- impose upon men what deprives them of their liberties, their rights as men, as creatures of God.<a name=351:7></a> I am not here to decry the authorities, far otherwise, but only to point out that in these last days men are suffering from unfair decrees, and the saints of God peculiarly so, as unable to conform with what denies divine rights in them.<a name=351:8></a> Contrary decrees and laws are formulated and established in certain countries in which the saints of God are; interfering with their consciences in obeying God, and in maintaining right relations with their fellow men, and especially with their brethren.<a name=351:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is important, therefore, that this principle of suffering should be understood, and how it is, in large measure, the way out of all such difficulties.<a name=351:10></a> Difficulties there are, cloudiness in the minds of many of God's dear people as to what to do, whether to obey

		Now in the book of Daniel we have the mind of God as to the times of the gentiles.<a name=352:7></a> The book holds great significance right up to the present moment as that which particularly affords light to us as to the powers that have been current since that time, the great gentile monarchies, or what other forms they have taken in these latter days.<a name=352:8></a> The book is full throughout, I might say radiant throughout, with loyal sufferings of devoted men, men devoted to God, who sacrificed their bodies rather than their consciences; who said in the most definite way, we must obey God rather than men.<a name=352:9></a> They said it not only in an undertone, in bated breath, but openly, and without a tremor of fear in the presence of the great monarch of the time.<a name=352:10></a> I wish to stress this because of its present bearing, and how God is opening up to His people the privilege of suffering.<a name=352:11></a> I mean suffering in this kind of way.<a name=352:12></a> Every saint suffers in some way.<a name=352:13></a> From the first movement of God in a man or a woman or child, the first effects of the work of God bring out sufferings.<a name=352:14></a> We see, for instance, in the babe in Abraham's house, how he that was horn after the flesh persecuted that babe.<a name=352:15></a> He was horn after the Spirit, and wherever new birth is, and where men move according to it in any

	<div class="paragraph">
		The prophetic scriptures show, especially the book of Revelation, that the saints who shall take up the position in the testimony after us, that is after the Lord translates the assembly to be with Himself, these saints shall suffer from the powers that be.<a name=353:2></a> They will suffer because of principles that are already in existence and that are already causing suffering to some of God's people.<a name=353:3></a> Others of God's people evade the point at issue, and miss the sufferings.<a name=353:4></a> Now I submit that it is unworthy of us with the light we have, with the calling we have, with the presence of the Holy Spirit here to support us, with the intercession of Christ in heaven, and with all the privileges that belong to us as of the assembly, that we should be behind the saints that are about to take our place in this world in testimony.<a name=353:5></a> They shall have much less in the way of privileges, much less light, but the Scriptures show that they suffer.<a name=353:6></a> They suffer because they refuse to obey man rather than God.<a name=353:7></a> Heaven makes much of them.<a name=353:8></a> They are expressly mentioned in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#20">Revelation  20</a>as sharing the thrones with those who, like ourselves have been translated to heaven before -- those that are beheaded under the reign of the beast.<a name=353:9></a> Heaven makes special mention of them as having to suffer through faithfulness.<a name=353:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So the Lord would speak to us as to whether we are at all in keeping with this great matter.<a name=353:11></a> He has allowed certain laws to come into effect which will occasion suffering if we apply the principle that we must obey God rather than men; and what is it but to bring out what He has put in us by the effective work of the Spirit, that is, the ability to suffer?<a name=353:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What is to be learned, I believe, at this present moment, is that we are to face things intelligently and see the bearing of what is presented to us, weighing every thing and resolving that God must have first place.<a name=354:12></a> What delight to heaven as a brother resolves in the secret of his soul that he will be loyal.<a name=354:13></a> Not compromising with the evil secretly and professing to be against it outwardly, but in purpose of heart to be <i>loyal</i>, to take a definite stand before God in the secret of his soul, that he must be loyal to God and to Christ.<a name=354:14></a> Heaven is with him.<a name=354:15></a> Heaven is delighted with such a resolve; all its power is behind him.<a name=354:16></a> But then heaven

		Finally, I just want to touch on the verse in Romans as the climax of all this: "If indeed we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified with him".<a name=359:1></a> This comes out now in relation to <i>children</i>, as you will observe.<a name=359:2></a> It is said, "The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit, that we are children of God.<a name=359:3></a> And if children, heirs also: heirs of God, and Christ's joint heirs; if indeed we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified with him".<a name=359:4></a> I desire to say a word very briefly as to this; first of all as to the relation of children that attaches to us.<a name=359:5></a> We have sufferers in Daniel in relation to the great public rulers in the times of the gentiles.<a name=359:6></a> Christ suffered under these same rulers, and so did the apostles, and now it is for us to suffer under them, and God will give deliverance in every case; but what is particularly to be desired is the society of the Son of God in the sufferings.<a name=359:7></a> Then we have, as I said, in <a href="../bible/John.htm#9">John  9</a>, sufferings through religious leaders.<a name=359:8></a> Here we are sufferers because we are the children of God, and the apostle tells us that the Spirit of God witnesses with our spirits.<a name=359:9></a> He distinguishes, notice, between the Spirit of God and our spirits, saying that the Spirit of God actually has transactions with our spirits, and gives us to understand through our spirits that we are the children of God.<a name=359:10></a> Not simply that Scripture says that believers have title to take the place of children, but the Spirit of God witnesses with our spirits -- a sweet function of the Spirit in every christian.<a name=359:11></a> Let us make room for it.<a name=359:12></a> I mean in this particular point, let our spirits be free.<a name=359:13></a> The epistle to the Romans is to liberate our spirits, and nothing could be more precious and comforting than that suggestion that comes to us by the Spirit that we are the children of God.<a name=359:14></a> "If children, heirs also: heirs of God, and Christ's joint-heirs; if indeed we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified with him".<a name=359:15></a> What a rich line of thought!<a name=359:16></a> It tends to detach us from this world, and to give us to see that it is essentially opposed to the

		J.T.<a name=390:1></a> The generations mentioned in the book of Genesis have been mentioned, the word translated "generation" having reference to origin, and what develops from the root or basic thought.<a name=390:2></a> We read part of chapter 2 this morning and dwelt upon the generation -- or history -- of the heavens and the earth, to see how that chapter is the counterpart of chapter 1, indicating the idea of fulness, an idea that runs through Scripture.<a name=390:3></a> We dwelt at length on the idea of intelligence in Man being able to name the lower order of creatures, and then being able to name Eve, or the woman, which led us into a wide field inclusive of the epistle to the Ephesians, where intelligence is stressed, especially in him to whom the mystery of the assembly was committed, and who calls attention to himself as possessed of this great intelligence.<a name=390:4></a> Much was said, too, as to naming evil things, which leads us into chapters 3 and 4.<a name=390:5></a>

		What may be said at the outset about this chapter is that it is "the book of Adam's generations", which is a more complete thought than we have in chapter 2, and enters definitely upon moral grounds rather than creatorial.<a name=390:6></a> On the moral line we have the thought of separation, and also of life, as over against chapter 4, which gives us a family also, but which is judged for moral reasons from the outset.<a name=390:7></a> Cain and his line as representative of the world are judged from the source, whereas chapter 5 stresses that Adam is retained as created, so that we have the line of life, the family of God in principle, which while taken up on moral grounds, is yet attached to the creatorial source: it is of God, as we get in the New Testament.<a name=390:8></a> The apostle says, "Of him are <i>ye</i> in Christ Jesus" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:30">1 Corinthians  1:30</a>), that is, of God,

	<div class="paragraph">
		What will help us to begin with is the similarity of names on both lines, which tends to confusion and calls for discrimination -- whether we meet an Enoch in the world, or an Enoch in the life line.<a name=391:2></a> Obviously the name, although the same literally, has a different bearing in each chapter.<a name=391:3></a> The same idea, that is, discipline or education, may be attached to Enoch in chapter 4 as in chapter 5, but it is a question of the stamp of the world in chapter 4, whereas in chapter 5 it is of God.<a name=391:4></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=391:12></a> In that chapter we begin with God creatorially, so that faith links us with God, God in a creatorial sense -- the Creator.<a name=391:13></a> It is a question of His word, so that the christian is set up in intelligence as to everything, and all is traced back to God.<a name=391:14></a> We are maintained in relation to God, who also is an absolute Being, and this is never to be lost sight of.<a name=391:15></a> The moral side begins in chapter 3, and properly links on with the first history, whereas in chapter 5 we begin another, and it is a book, so we are on more definite and firmer ground.<a name=391:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=392:16></a> Yes, and the seventh alludes to a development through exercise.<a name=392:17></a> It is the seventh from Adam through Seth.<a name=392:18></a> The idea is in Adam, but Adam on moral grounds now, although on creatorial grounds too.<a name=392:19></a> That is maintained, but it is an Adam who has gone through things with God and reached the idea of life, because he calls his wife's name Eve, meaning, not simply that she was living, but "the mother of all living", the family idea of something continuing.<a name=392:20></a> So that we have in Adam the line maintained on moral grounds, but through life as in chapter 3, not as in chapters 1 and 2; the former in its amplification involves christianity.<a name=392:21></a> The Enoch of chapter 4 would be like the education of the world, as among the Greeks

		The references to Noah in the New Testament are significant, particularly as to the number eight, Peter alluding twice to him under that head, also as a "preacher of righteousness", and our Lord alluding to him and his days -- "the days of Noe" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#24:37">Matthew  24:37</a>).<a name=411:7></a> Then the writer to the Hebrews brings him before us in relation to his house, and as a builder, also as "heir of the righteousness which is according to faith".<a name=411:8></a> The suggestion is that he and his family represent the idea of a number sufficient for any given enterprise, an idea that runs through Scripture.<a name=411:9></a> God has his number, in Noah's case a very small number called "few", but sufficient for the undertaking on hand.<a name=411:10></a>

		I want to show from the passage read in Samuel how, from the divine side, Saul was to come into all this, I mean in figure.<a name=524:12></a> I wish to speak of him as representing a young christian, as I see that perhaps the greater number here are young, and one wanted to seek to make this service bear upon them, for the word is always written in large letters in front of such a company, The Lord has need of you -- but on His own terms, and that is what comes out here.<a name=524:13></a> First, Samuel says to Saul, "stand thou still now, that I may cause thee to hear the word of God".<a name=524:14></a> The believer is now regarded as having the Lord

		Well, the next thing is the third verse -- that is, it is not simply coming to a meeting like this and listening to what is said and perhaps talking about it afterwards, it is that you should become spiritual, that is the intent of God.<a name=529:1></a> You go forward from that point, you have learned that people are caring for you, sorrowing for you, and that in truth you are in the position of a lost one -- a very wholesome feeling: I think of the one who is lost and the parent who is sorrowing.<a name=529:2></a> Maybe there is someone like that here tonight, may all this be a cheer to your heart!<a name=529:3></a> -- Rachel weeping for her children.<a name=529:4></a> But I am speaking of verse 3: "Thou shalt thou go on forward from thence, and shalt come to the oak of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God, to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three cakes of bread, and another carrying a flask of wine".<a name=529:5></a> So far Saul is not carrying anything; he has not entered on levitical service at all, but these are a carrying people, but mark it, beloved young people, this is an environment, it is an objective thing, divinely arranged for you.<a name=529:6></a> We have had three days here, remarkable days; well, these three days afford objective thoughts for young people, because spirituality arises not only from the fact that you have the Spirit, but that you have spiritual suggestions presented to you.<a name=529:7></a> The forty days were replete with these, the Lord presenting Himself, and then being <i>seen of</i> them -- it is where our eyes are; the spiritual suggestions are to be absorbed.<a name=529:8></a> The natural mind does not absorb them at all, although it may take them in superficially.<a name=529:9></a> It says in Hebrews, "partakers of the Holy Spirit .<a name=529:10></a>.<a name=529:11></a>.<a name=529:12></a> and have fallen away" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#6:4">Hebrews  6:4</a> - 6).<a name=529:13></a> That does not refer to real christians, it refers to such persons as Saul here, taking part in things externally and yet failing in them entirely.<a name=529:14></a> So that, as I said before, we have to get into our minds, if we are to be spiritual, the idea of a divine environment presented, and God has brought it in here.<a name=529:15></a> It is an

		One of the greatest matters in these recent times amongst the brethren is the subject of prophecy; this first book of Samuel is marked by it.<a name=533:3></a> If Saul did not enter into it, as history shows us he did not, there were those who did and there were those who came under rule in their prophecy.<a name=533:4></a> This book later on presents Samuel as presiding over a number of prophets who were prophesying, and I would urge it upon every brother and sister here (sisters prophesied too in the early days), why not get into that company and learn how to prophesy?<a name=533:5></a> Well, you say, that is a gift.<a name=533:6></a> Of course, but it has to be learned; Samuel is said to have been presiding over them, and so great was the spirit of prophecy that Saul, who was seeking to murder David, came under the power of the spirit of prophecy himself, as we read in chapter 19.<a name=533:7></a> So you see the mind of God is to bring in this in the presence of the Philistines, to bring in this powerful service, which brings God in; prophecy brings God in, so that God is known of a truth amongst us.<a name=533:8></a> What can the Philistines do against God?<a name=533:9></a> If God comes in they must go, and that is the great point in the two letters to Corinth -- to bring the Philistine, the big man, down by bringing God in.<a name=533:10></a> Thus it is said, God is amongst you of a truth.<a name=533:11></a> What can a man of the greatest human learning and experience do in the presence of the power of prophecy?<a name=533:12></a> He can do nothing.<a name=533:13></a> Thus Saul is called into the prophetic scene to learn how to prophesy.<a name=533:14></a> They have a lute, a tambour, a pipe and a harp.<a name=533:15></a> That is, that which appeals to and draws out spiritual feelings; this is largely the idea of musical instruments in Scripture, they are to draw out the best spiritual feelings we have.<a name=533:16></a>

		Then we are told in verse 7, "And it shall be, when these signs shall come to thee .<a name=535:7></a>.<a name=535:8></a>.<a name=535:9></a> God is with thee".<a name=535:10></a> That is another thing, the sense that God is with you; God is with you, even with a Saul.<a name=535:11></a> Is this all unattractive to the young people here?<a name=535:12></a> Think of having God with you!<a name=535:13></a> His Spirit is come upon you, and now, after these signs, God is with you.<a name=535:14></a> Then it says, "Thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and behold, I will come down to thee .<a name=535:15></a>.<a name=535:16></a>.<a name=535:17></a> and inform thee what thou shalt do".<a name=535:18></a> This is a most solemn matter because God is going to test me, to test me as to whether I can wait for Him, whether I can be obedient.<a name=535:19></a> That was the great test of Saul; and that was what lost him his kingdom, he failed in obedience, he failed to wait his time -- the great lesson in Gilgal has to be learned.<a name=535:20></a> How incorrigible the flesh is!<a name=535:21></a> Circumcision means that it has to be dealt with drastically.<a name=535:22></a> If I cannot wait there I am disqualified and that is what happened in the case of this man.<a name=535:23></a> As the passage goes on it says in verses 9 and 10, "it was so .<a name=535:24></a>.<a name=535:25></a>.<a name=535:26></a> and all those signs came to pass that day .<a name=535:27></a>.<a name=535:28></a>.<a name=535:29></a> and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them".<a name=535:30></a> So that immediately before he goes to Gilgal he is able to do something, and one has often seen that with young people, they can do quite a little, but the real test is Gilgal -- being able to wait for God there, and in waiting you are impressed every moment and you are tested with the incorrigibleness of the flesh; that is what impresses you at Gilgal.<a name=535:31></a> All the feelings that are there are against the flesh -- can I wait there?<a name=535:32></a> Saul could not wait, but that is anticipating his history -- I cannot go into that, but it is well to see that, dear young people,

		"Then the people said one to another, What is this that has happened to the son of Kish?<a name=536:2></a> Is Saul also among the prophets?<a name=536:3></a>" That is what people say among themselves, what brethren sometimes say in their houses after a meeting.<a name=536:4></a> A young brother is prompted to say something in a ministry meeting -- pardon me for being simple and practical -- well, the brethren say, What do you think of that, what do you think of so-and-so, he has attempted to prophesy, but what is his external conduct and is it in keeping?<a name=536:5></a> It says, "The people said one to another, What is this that has happened to the son of Kish?<a name=536:6></a>" It is a searching matter.<a name=536:7></a> I am not saying that you should not take part in ministry, but then have you given occasion for this table talk?<a name=536:8></a> I am not saying that the brethren should enlarge on it, I know how they do, often far beyond what should be spoken of, but here the question is asked, What has happened to the son of Kish?<a name=536:9></a> Why, he goes out and plays cricket, and plays tennis, and goes off on the Broads in the summer-time, and other things like that, and yet he is prophesying!<a name=536:10></a>

		It is a solemn thing that the brethren have a judgment about you, and heaven has a judgment about you, and yet heaven wants you and heaven is doing its utmost to help you to serve as a true levite.<a name=536:11></a> You will understand, dear brethren, I am not here to whip you, far otherwise, but to seek to help all of us to get into accord with heaven and to become spiritual, to enter into the environment that God has placed for us here, to absorb the suggestions of the spiritual environment in which we are set, to take them on constitutionally, so that we become spiritual.<a name=536:12></a> Saul never did: if he had done so, we should never have had the proverb, "Is Saul also among the prophets?<a name=536:13></a>" This is written again after his history was well-nigh finished

		(chapter 19); the proverb, I am sure, would never have been recorded, had Saul judged himself at the outset, but alas, he did not.<a name=537:1></a> So the proverb remains; it says at the end of verse 12, "It became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?<a name=537:2></a>" I would not like to be the subject of such a proverb: Saul was, and why was he?<a name=537:3></a> Because he failed in this great test, he failed to take on spirituality through what was divinely presented to him; and he failed to wait at Gilgal.<a name=537:4></a> Had he taken in these great spiritual thoughts he would have said there, 'I am not in keeping with them;' for it was the place of circumcision, and this accepted is the acknowledgment that the flesh is incorrigible and has to be put off.<a name=537:5></a> Gilgal is "the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of the Christ" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:11">Colossians  2:11</a>).<a name=537:6></a>

		God is calling upon us for reality and particularly spirituality in our reality, so that you have another thought here and that is, "A man of that place answered and said, But who is their father?<a name=537:7></a>" Someone there had that thought.<a name=537:8></a> As most of you know, the subject of our reading meetings during the last three days has been the ten generations spoken of in the book of Genesis, the word denoting origin, and so it is that someone in the place where one takes up service says, What about the parentage?<a name=537:9></a> This must apply to us all.<a name=537:10></a> The service of God requires more than profession, our origin spiritually must be manifest, and this is a root matter.<a name=537:11></a> The history from the outset must be gone into.<a name=537:12></a> The history or generation of Saul in that sense is gone into and this proverb is written across it: "Is Saul also among the prophets?<a name=537:13></a>" It is derision; a sorrowful thing as relating to one prominent in the service of God.<a name=537:14></a> It is written as a warning.<a name=537:15></a> On the other hand, the scripture before us is most encouraging as showing the pains that God takes with us so that He might have us for Himself in service, whatever it may be.<a name=537:16></a> May He help us all to profit by the great care He expends upon us!<a name=537:17></a>
