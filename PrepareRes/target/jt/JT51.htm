		J.T.<a name=1:5></a> It is said in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>, in view of the appointment of an apostle, that he should be from those who assembled with the disciples during all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among them, beginning from the baptism of John until Jesus was received up.<a name=1:6></a> It is thought that the Lord would help us to consider in Matthew's gospel, what feature of the truth entered into certain occasions in which He came in among the disciples and went out as indicated there.<a name=1:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Our consideration of this subject should familiarise us with divine activities as seen in Christ in assembly service; whether it be the assembly meeting for the Lord's supper, and all that enters into that, or the meeting for prayer, meetings such as this for scriptural inquiry, or for prophetic ministry, or even for gospel testimony.<a name=1:8></a> We shall, in this way, become familiarised with the thought of the Lord's movements, not as on earth, but by the Spirit now; nevertheless, <i>His</i> movements.<a name=1:9></a> How varied the truth is; how each occasion of His coming in implies something distinctive, for in coming in He has confidence in us.<a name=1:10></a> It may be, however, to rebuke or to reprove us, as we shall see in these meetings of the disciples.<a name=1:11></a> In going out, He would leave us with the understanding that we are to carry on during the period of His absence.<a name=1:12></a> The fact that an apostle was required to have that experience shows how important it is.<a name=1:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Christianity is not a dead religion, but is marked by activity and intelligence; firstly divine activity, and then our activity, levitical and priestly, and especially in authoritative service.<a name=1:14></a> Unless service in some measure takes on authority, it has no effect.<a name=1:15></a> We have no formal

		authority, but there is to be moral weight, and apostleship implies that.<a name=2:1></a> The period selected by the Spirit here begins with the baptism of John; not from John's birth, nor from the Incarnation, but the period when Christ's public ministry began until it finished; as it is said in the verses in Acts, "until the day in which he was taken up"; right up to that day His service went on.<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may see in the baptism of John, the beginning of a period.<a name=2:3></a> There was the announcement from heaven of sonship; and, as in Christ, how pleasing it was to heaven.<a name=2:4></a> He had come under God's eye for the previous thirty years, and the accumulated delight of heaven was expressed there.<a name=2:5></a> Then, as He is about to go up, He presents Himself to the disciples <i>living</i>.<a name=2:6></a> It is clear on the one hand that heaven is engaged with Christ in the testimony; and, as it saw Him here at thirty years.<a name=2:7></a> We too are to be engaged with Him as He would have us see Him.<a name=2:8></a> He was seen of the disciples <i>as He presented Himself</i>; meaning that He took up a particular attitude in which He would have them view Him.<a name=2:9></a>

		H.H.<a name=2:10></a> Would <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3:16">1 Timothy  3:16</a> fit in with that a little?<a name=2:11></a> "God has been manifested in flesh, has been justified in the Spirit, has appeared to angels, has been preached among the nations, has been believed on in the world, has been received up in glory".<a name=2:12></a> Would that cover the period from the baptism of John until the time of His going up?<a name=2:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:14></a> I think it would.<a name=2:15></a> It is the mystery of piety connected with the assembly which is the pillar and base of the truth.<a name=2:16></a> Timothy was to know how one ought to behave oneself in it.<a name=2:17></a>

		J.T.<a name=2:19></a> That is what I thought we might get clear about to begin with; how the Person of Christ comes before us; then His movements as coming in and going out.<a name=2:20></a> It says, "All the time in which the Lord

		Jesus came in and went out among us".<a name=3:1></a> We have first heaven's testimony; then Christ's movements in the period mentioned; and finally His presentation of Himself to them living before He went up.<a name=3:2></a>

		J.T.<a name=3:4></a> Well, one would hope that there are those now, ready to listen to what heaven has to say about Christ, as also to appreciate His own presentation of Himself to us, as in the Lord's supper.<a name=3:5></a>

		J.T.<a name=3:8></a> The word ' necessary ' there is important.<a name=3:9></a> It was not a mere idea that came into their minds.<a name=3:10></a> The horrible death of Judas is spoken of, and we know how far away he was in his ways from the ways of Christ.<a name=3:11></a> We are to be warned by his ways.<a name=3:12></a> It is said he "became guide to those who took Jesus; for he was numbered amongst us, and had received a part in this service".<a name=3:13></a> Then we are told of the kind of death he met with, and the Psalms are brought in to testify.<a name=3:14></a> "Let his homestead become desolate, and let there be no dweller in it; and, Let another take his overseership" (verse 20).<a name=3:15></a> There is a vacancy, and the Spirit of God stresses why there is a vacancy.<a name=3:16></a> Persons dropping out of the testimony leave places to be filled, and hence the necessity of this matter.<a name=3:17></a> "It is necessary therefore, that of the men who have assembled with us all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us, .<a name=3:18></a>.<a name=3:19></a>.<a name=3:20></a> one of these should be a witness with us of his resurrection.<a name=3:21></a>" That there should be no more such vacancies, each of us should stand true in his place.<a name=3:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is characteristic of what we are saying, the Lord Jesus coming in and going out among the disciples.<a name=38:2></a> This passage indicates that He had been saying things in an inner circle; for although He was speaking to the crowds, it is said that "his mother and his brethren stood without, seeking to speak to him".<a name=38:3></a> They were outside and He was inside, nor does He bring them in; He rather remains where He was in the midst of those to be known henceforth as His disciples, and His true brethren.<a name=38:4></a> He says, "Whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in the heavens, he is my brother, and sister, and mother".<a name=38:5></a> Our consideration at this time will be of brethren from Matthew's point of view, and the teaching of chapter 13 based on it; the truth of the assembly brought out.<a name=38:6></a> The brethren are introduced into the secrets of His parabolic ministry, which hides the truth from certain who had been under it; they are not to understand; as to them the ministry is judicial in character.<a name=38:7></a> There are those who do understand; they are instructed in the <i>house</i>.<a name=38:8></a> "Then, having dismissed the crowds, he went into the house; and his disciples came to him, saying, Expound to us the parable of the darnel of the field".<a name=38:9></a> We get the mystery of the kingdom opened up to us in the house; we are distinctly in an inside position in this section, leading up to the assembly.<a name=38:10></a>

		So as to carry the thoughts relative to our subject forward, priesthood is mentioned here, and later in this chapter there are certain ones in Israel alluded to as priests without naming them.<a name=129:4></a> In <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#19:22">Exodus  19:22</a> God says, "And the priests also, who come near to Jehovah, shall hallow themselves, lest Jehovah break forth on them".<a name=129:5></a> That is a collateral thought with what we have had.<a name=129:6></a> Priesthood is founded on manhood according to God, but also on sonship as applied fully in the New Testament -- the Son is the Priest.<a name=129:7></a> God expresses His thoughts for us and carries them forward.<a name=129:8></a> The full setting of priesthood is seen in chapters 28 and 29.<a name=129:9></a>

		I have in mind to speak about <i>eldership</i> among the people of God.<a name=167:1></a> It is a thought that began very early, involving the idea of rank as over against the great modern developments.<a name=167:2></a> We have the word <i>rank</i> applied to our Lord Jesus as the first from among the dead, "each in his own rank: the first-fruits, Christ" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:23">1 Corinthians  15:23</a>).<a name=167:3></a> We have the thought applied to Michael also; he is called an archangel (<a href="../bible/Jude.htm#9">Jude  9</a>).<a name=167:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What is in mind now is to speak of rank as based on <i>experience with God</i> as essential to government in the assembly; for if this truth is largely lost in the world it is to be maintained in the assembly.<a name=167:5></a> Every divine thought is to find expression in the assembly, and no thought is in a way more significant than government.<a name=167:6></a> As creating man, God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over the whole earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth on the earth.<a name=167:7></a> And God created Man in his image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:26">Genesis  1:26</a>,27).<a name=167:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is in mind now to stress experience with God as finding, if it exists, its own proper place among the saints in our times.<a name=167:9></a> If it does not exist we can only speak of it in the abstract, but if it does, it should be recognised.<a name=167:10></a> The thought begins in Paul's address to a youthful brother, Timothy, "Let no one despise thy youth, but be a model of the believers, in word, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#4:12">1 Timothy  4:12</a>).<a name=167:11></a> The men whom Paul, under God, selected to ordain elders, were young; they were not themselves elders in the sense of age and long experience.<a name=167:12></a> What enhanced

		their quality was that they were children of Paul, each is called a child of Paul, spiritually so.<a name=168:1></a> Paul had become an elder, "being such a one", he says, "as Paul the aged" (<a href="../bible/Philemon.htm#9">Philemon  9</a>); not simply being an old brother.<a name=168:2></a> In delegating Titus and Timotheus to appoint elders he certainly would avoid any charge of incongruity in using young men to appoint old ones.<a name=168:3></a> The spiritual link and character derived from Paul by these young men, qualified them as his children, and overcame all that.<a name=168:4></a> If anyone questioned Timotheus or Titus, Paul would soon call attention to the fact that they had overcome the discrepancy of youth in what they were doing; no one could despise their youth.<a name=168:5></a> They were so morally great that their comparative youth was no handicap to them.<a name=168:6></a> Hence the idea of eldership, or experience with God, should start with the very youngest here.<a name=168:7></a> The beginning is noted in the word, "Let no one despise thy youth".<a name=168:8></a> It means that I am putting on such features of maturity in my manners and ways that no one can rightly despise it; if they do, they discredit themselves.<a name=168:9></a>

		I have selected these three scriptures, because they bring out this thought of eldership in function, for it is only as a thing, or a person, is in function, that you can determine what he is.<a name=168:10></a> If a brother never says anything in the meeting, he is not functioning.<a name=168:11></a> When he begins to speak in the assembly, and speak in a priestly way, then we begin to <i>name</i> him, but we cannot do it earlier except in a negative sense which, of course, we are loath to do.<a name=168:12></a> Sometimes one wonders whether the devil has not a hand in the silence that some brothers maintain in the assembly.<a name=168:13></a> It is said of the Lord that He taught the disciples how to pray.<a name=168:14></a> One of them said to Him, "Lord, teach us to pray, even as John also taught his disciples" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#11:1">Luke  11:1</a>).<a name=168:15></a> The Lord immediately taught them how to pray, and gave examples of prayer too; and He goes on to the very greatest thing that may be obtained by prayer, saying "How much rather shall

		I have been saying that young ones should develop in that way, and that no one should despise their youth.<a name=169:14></a> "Let no one despise thy youth.<a name=169:15></a>" It certainly will be despised if you are frivolous, negligent, or careless in regard to the things of God, and you will become questionable as to any value at all in the assembly.<a name=169:16></a> So that eldership begins when we are young, as we avoid giving occasion to any one to despise our youth.<a name=169:17></a>

		I wish to speak a little about <i>the truth</i>, and I have selected John's writings on which to base my remarks because he speaks more about truth than any of the New Testament writers.<a name=192:1></a> He uses the word truth about forty times, as compared with the use of it about sixty times in the rest of the New Testament.<a name=192:2></a> He has this phase of the testimony particularly in mind, and it is significant inasmuch as he is "the disciple whom Jesus loved" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#21:20">John  21:20</a>).<a name=192:3></a> Sometimes love is mentioned as over against the truth, and it is, therefore, significant that the disciple who knew love perhaps better than any, for he was the disciple whom Jesus loved, refers to truth so extensively.<a name=192:4></a> He says indeed, "Hereby we have known love, because <i>he</i> has laid down his life for us" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:16">1 John  3:16</a>).<a name=192:5></a> He does not base his knowledge on the fact that the Lord loved <i>him</i>, but on the great general testimony of Christ's death, that He laid down His life for us.<a name=192:6></a> That is a great objective thought.<a name=192:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		John nevertheless had a great opportunity of knowing love subjectively, and several times he refers to himself as the disciple whom Jesus loved.<a name=192:8></a> He must have had wonderful experiences of love in the Lord's company.<a name=192:9></a> It is a remarkable thing that he is said to have been <i>in</i> the bosom of Jesus at one particular time.<a name=192:10></a> What times he must have had!<a name=192:11></a> and they were intended to impress him, for if he is to speak of love, he is not only to know it objectively, but to convey the thought of it as <i>enjoyed</i>.<a name=192:12></a> The Lord, speaking to His own mother, said of John, "Woman, behold thy son"(chapter 19:26); so that he would come under the influence and affections of a real mother, who had experience such as no other mother ever had, nor could have.<a name=192:13></a> John had that advantage, as he stood in relation to her as a son to a mother; and that was in "his own home".<a name=192:14></a> Whether he lived alone otherwise

		The light of these things will help us in this great matter of the truth, having in mind the last days, as we have often remarked, when the truth will be greatly compromised and lost to view.<a name=193:5></a> John is very insistent on its being kept in view, and not only in the Scriptures, and in our meetings, but in general practice.<a name=193:6></a> Hence the first verse I read says, "he that practises the truth comes to the light".<a name=193:7></a> It is a very important matter at this juncture to see, as I hope to make plain, that the truth involves principles; these principles are apt to be beclouded, it is the enemy's business to becloud them.<a name=193:8></a> The mystery of iniquity which began in the days of the apostle Paul has specially taken on the character of deception.<a name=193:9></a> It will culminate in the man of sin, whose coming is in all deceivableness of unrighteousness.<a name=193:10></a> He is at our very doors, we might say; not that he is here personally, but his features are here; they have been, indeed, right through, only that they are now more manifest in our own times; deceivableness of unrighteousness is one of the great features, and through this means Satan seeks to becloud the truth.<a name=193:11></a>

		I want to say something about <i>outlook</i>; it is a much used word.<a name=206:1></a> The outlook of many is dark at the present time.<a name=206:2></a> Sometimes the darkness arises from one's personal circumstances; sometimes from a pessimistic disposition, which makes more of what is against it than what is for it; and sometimes from a fearful disposition.<a name=206:3></a> The outlook of the characteristic believer is always bright and promising.<a name=206:4></a> It hinges on three things -- faith, hope and love.<a name=206:5></a> Faith and hope are grouped together; love is put over against them both -- "the greater of these" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#13:13">1 Corinthians  13:13</a>).<a name=206:6></a> They are both great, but love is greater.<a name=206:7></a> It would seem as if faith and hope are of about the same value, but love is greater.<a name=206:8></a> Indeed, without it the other two become of little value.<a name=206:9></a> Without love we are nothing, that is what Scripture says; and, of course, that makes a great many people worth nothing; far more than, perhaps, many of us have imagined.<a name=206:10></a> Without love we are said to be nothing, a very solemn matter, because it is the divine standard.<a name=206:11></a> When God comes to weigh things, which He will do and is doing, there will be a standard, and that standard is Christ.<a name=206:12></a> Not that judgment is not graded; it is graded.<a name=206:13></a> You can understand that, when you receive the things done in the body in view of having a place in the kingdom, God will take great pains so that everything is accredited to one worthy of credits; but those who have no faith, who die in unbelief, and consequently have no love, are worthy of no credits; a most solemn consideration.<a name=206:14></a> So that it is well, if there be one here who is without love, to look into the matter.<a name=206:15></a> For a person with no love is nothing; in the divine realm he is nothing at all.<a name=206:16></a> Thus his outlook cannot be bright or assuring.<a name=206:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, the outlook, as I said, of the true christian is bright characteristically; always bright.<a name=206:18></a> The more

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, all that is preliminary, and it is for every young person here, for each of us, to inquire as to whether he has ever had such a transaction as that.<a name=207:18></a> Buying and selling is a very common thing, but did ever two commodities like those go into barter?<a name=207:19></a> Here is a mess of pottage.<a name=207:20></a> But what did the man say?<a name=207:21></a> Esau said, I am going to die; what good is the inheritance to me?<a name=207:22></a>.<a name=207:23></a> The fact is, he did not value the inheritance.<a name=207:24></a> Many millions of believers, who valued the inheritance, since

		J.T.<a name=317:1></a> Our subject for these readings is <i>Confessors of the Son of God</i>.<a name=317:2></a> In considering it, we may see how the truth apprehended and confessed works out in practice and testimony.<a name=317:3></a> The first to be considered is Peter and then Paul; Peter in relation to the <i>assembly</i>, and Paul in relation to <i>preaching</i>.<a name=317:4></a> Paul is the first who is said to have <i>preached</i> the Son of God; in fact, his confession is in the form of preaching (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:20">Acts  9:20</a>).<a name=317:5></a> There is also John the baptist, whose testimony is related to the <i>sacrificial</i> side of the truth; and then Nathanael, Martha, the centurion, and others.<a name=317:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It was thought that we should begin with the <i>leading</i> features of our subject, for it appears that we get better results on occasions like this, in beginning at the top, thus seeing the full general thought of a subject, and then how it develops in detail.<a name=317:7></a> The passages read will enable us to do this.<a name=317:8></a> The Lord deliberately raises the question of who He was; what men were saying about Him.<a name=317:9></a> The Father had to do with the matter, as we see in Peter's answer.<a name=317:10></a> Peter is enlightened by revelation; not by teaching, but by a revelation by the Father.<a name=317:11></a> He says, "<i>Thou</i> art the Christ, the Son of the living God".<a name=317:12></a> This is one of the most interesting sections of Scripture, because it is divinely arranged with a view to bringing out the great truth of Christ and the assembly.<a name=317:13></a> The assembly is seen in Matthew in an administrative sense, corresponding with what is in heaven for the maintenance of the truth -- the whole truth -- "and hades' gates shall not prevail against it".<a name=317:14></a> Whatever the attack, it will remain invulnerable.<a name=317:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This part of our subject ought to help us today as to the general position, including government requirements and the like; for we are to maintain uprightness, and at the same time avoid any unnecessary feeling; as Christ said to Peter, "But that we may not be an offence to them".<a name=318:6></a> This brings out how the saints are brought into the particular truth before us.<a name=318:7></a> "And when he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him".<a name=318:8></a> Matthew usually connects all such instruction with the house, the place of affection.<a name=318:9></a>

		I am thinking of the word "double" in these scriptures we have read and my remarks will stand in relation to this word; to what it suggests in the connection indicated, namely, the Holy Spirit.<a name=398:1></a> The verses alluded to in 2 Kings refer to the portion of the first-born (see <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#21:17">Deuteronomy  21:17</a>).<a name=398:2></a>

		The servants of God in the Old Testament times profited by what preceded them and of course the same should be true of those of us who belong to the present dispensation.<a name=398:3></a> We find, in the Old Testament, constant allusions by the servants of God to what preceded them; the ministries are thus accumulative.<a name=398:4></a> This is seen in the Bible itself; the books usually begin with "And".<a name=398:5></a> Genesis does not, for it is the beginning, and there are other exceptions, but generally there is the cumulative idea; the conjunction links the books together.<a name=398:6></a> In Exodus the Spirit of God continues from the book of Genesis; it is not isolated, but linked together by the Spirit of God and intended to be so read.<a name=398:7></a> We may thank God for the order that the Bible was <i>Appointed to be read in churches</i>; that was made against the prohibition of its general use, which earlier had been in force.<a name=398:8></a> It certainly is read today among God's people who understand the assembly, and we may be thankful for its wide use even by those who do not understand much of its true spiritual meaning.<a name=398:9></a>

		We began in 2 Kings with the thought of speaking about this word "double".<a name=399:6></a> It is used in Scripture many times more than in the passages I have read.<a name=399:7></a> What I am seeking to bring forward is the portion that belongs to the first-born.<a name=399:8></a> Elisha did not claim to be first-born, in fact he was last-born in his own estimation; last of all.<a name=399:9></a> When Elijah called him there were twelve yoke of oxen and he with the <i>twelfth</i>.<a name=399:10></a> He is not seeking to be first.<a name=399:11></a> So it was with the greatest of servants, Paul; his name meaning <i>little</i>; in his own estimation, "less than the least of all saints".<a name=399:12></a> It is the Holy Spirit speaking in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13:9">Acts  13:9</a>.<a name=399:13></a> Elisha is not claiming anything from his birthright; whatever place he came in in the family, he took the last place.<a name=399:14></a> In <a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#19">1 Kings  19</a>we learn that Elijah cast his mantle on him, indicating his spiritual influence.<a name=399:15></a> Influence may be imparted without words, but when we come under spiritual influence, we shall ask questions.<a name=399:16></a> So here in <a href="../bible/2Kings.htm#2">2 Kings  2</a>, Elisha is under the influence of Elijah through his mantle.<a name=399:17></a> Elijah did not <i>fold</i> his mantle when he cast it upon Elisha, as he did at the Jordan.<a name=399:18></a> In wrapping it together at the Jordan, it was a question of power meeting the condensed power of the enemy; meeting it with the power of God.<a name=399:19></a> The ark of the covenant implies that too.<a name=399:20></a> The ark held back the waters, although Jordan was in all its power; although overflowing its banks, it was held back by the ark.<a name=399:21></a> There was no water in sight.<a name=399:22></a> As I was saying, the mantle of Elijah affected Elisha, so that he followed him.<a name=399:23></a> Elijah says to him, "What have I done to thee?<a name=399:24></a>".<a name=399:25></a> Influence is there.<a name=399:26></a> It remained with Elisha.<a name=399:27></a>

		I urge this matter of influence.<a name=400:1></a> Elisha never lost it; he clung to Elijah.<a name=400:2></a> He says, "As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee!<a name=400:3></a> And they two went on".<a name=400:4></a> Again, "they two stood by the Jordan", "they two went over" -- "they went on and talked".<a name=400:5></a> Now Elijah has in mind to honour and benefit his attendant.<a name=400:6></a> He was a young servant attached to an older servant.<a name=400:7></a> He poured water on the hands of Elijah; he would enhance his service.<a name=400:8></a> He did not wish Elijah to be removed to make room for himself.<a name=400:9></a> Some young men may consider older ones are in the way, and it must be admitted that if they are not spiritual, they can be obstructers of the work; they may be a hindrance by undue activities.<a name=400:10></a> Elisha would keep Elijah going.<a name=400:11></a> When in danger, on one occasion, Elijah imposed restrictions on himself, taking himself out of God's hands.<a name=400:12></a> To support a man who imposes restrictions on himself in this sense is not right.<a name=400:13></a> Elijah stood before hundreds of false prophets and gained the day, but fled from Jezebel and asked God to kill him; it was self-imposed.<a name=400:14></a> If God gives me liberty, gives me a commission, and I impose restrictions on myself which would frustrate it, I am lawless.<a name=400:15></a> That is what Elijah did, but he recovered himself, and later he is a type of Christ going up into heaven.<a name=400:16></a> We have dwelt on these matters in our meetings.<a name=400:17></a> It is most precious to see how, though this great servant turns aside, in the strength of the food that God supplied he journeyed forty days to mount Horeb.<a name=400:18></a> God meets him at the end of it.<a name=400:19></a> He says to him, "What doest thou here, Elijah?<a name=400:20></a>"; as much as to say, This is not <i>your</i> place.<a name=400:21></a>

		I proceed now to speak of what Elisha obtained from Elijah.<a name=400:22></a> Elijah says to him, "Ask what I shall do for thee".<a name=400:23></a> Elisha said, "I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.<a name=400:24></a> And he said, "Thou hast asked a hard thing: if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so to thee; but if not, it shall not be so".<a name=400:25></a> What I am speaking of, the double portion,

		Elijah's remark to Elisha that the reception of the double portion of his spirit depended on his seeing him as he went up, as I said, enlarges on the manner of Christ's ascension (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>).<a name=402:1></a> The two men in white say, "This Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven, shall thus come in the manner in which ye have beheld him going into heaven" (verse 11).<a name=402:2></a> Notice the word <i>manner</i>.<a name=402:3></a> It is He Himself.<a name=402:4></a> It is the Jesus whom we have known, who now comes among us spiritually, whose traits have affected our hearts; we shall see Him descending; we shall ascend with Him.<a name=402:5></a> It is the descent of love, the Bridegroom coming for His bride, coming down for her, to take her to be with Himself, to present her to Himself, all-glorious, without spot or wrinkle.<a name=402:6></a> We need to be in His hand so that we may be prepared morally for all this.<a name=402:7></a> The assembly herself when He is pleased to display her, comes down "prepared as a bride adorned for her husband" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21:2">Revelation  21:2</a>).<a name=402:8></a> For Him!<a name=402:9></a> Think of the display of glory in that adornment!<a name=402:10></a> All this is because of the double portion.<a name=402:11></a> Elisha had received the double portion; the sons of the prophets knew enough to say, "The spirit of Elijah rests upon Elisha".<a name=402:12></a> The assembly has the Spirit of Christ.<a name=402:13></a>

		Now as to the later verses read in <a href="../bible/2Kings.htm#2">2 Kings  2</a>, the great matter is how to adjust the local company.<a name=402:14></a> This comes in as the Spirit has His place.<a name=402:15></a> The men of Jericho said to Elisha, "Behold now, the situation of the city is good, as my lord sees; but the water is bad, and the land is barren".<a name=402:16></a> It is a local condition.<a name=402:17></a> What can I do with a local company where defective conditions exist?<a name=402:18></a> The men of the city described the state.<a name=402:19></a> Elisha says, "Bring me a new cruse".<a name=402:20></a> They evidently had it, or could conveniently procure it: they brought it to him.<a name=402:21></a> The prophet had asked them to "put salt in it", that is to say, what is preservative.<a name=402:22></a> There is no hope at all for the local company if the new cruse and salt -- what they typify -- do not exist there; nothing can be done.<a name=402:23></a> There must be something in the locality besides what

		THE SERVICE OF GOD IN THE FOUR GOSPELS (1)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#2:1">Matthew  2:1</a>-12
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I had before me the introduction of the service of God in the four gospels, each having its own distinctiveness.<a name=408:1></a> The feature of the gospel as seen in Matthew is the worship of the Son, an important feature indeed.<a name=408:2></a> This gospel has more in it bearing on this than any other has, particularly as seen in the magi.<a name=408:3></a> They not only come to worship, but they come bringing something in their hands.<a name=408:4></a> "Homage" is the word for worship here; it indicates personal reverence.<a name=408:5></a> This supreme reverence is seen peculiarly in this chapter and in this book.<a name=408:6></a> So in chapter 4, we see that the devil breaks in on this particular service, seeking to get the Lord to worship him.<a name=408:7></a> Again in chapter 9, there is Jairus, who worshipped Him, and there are several other instances, particularly at the end of the gospel, where He is worshipped; we are to keep in mind that this is a feature of the divine service.<a name=408:8></a> We know God is the supreme Object of worship.<a name=408:9></a> Yet the Lord is God, so in this gospel He is presented as the Object of our worship.<a name=408:10></a> He is presented to us for our reverence in <a href="../bible/Micah.htm#5:2">Micah  5:2</a> which speaks of Him as "Ruler in Israel: whose goings forth are from of old, from the days of eternity", and also in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#2:6">Matthew  2:6</a>: "A leader who shall shepherd my people Israel".<a name=408:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are other instances of man as such being worshipped, as in chapter 18:26; "the bondman therefore falling down did him homage".<a name=408:12></a> The creditor here in this instance is not a divine Person, of course, but we must consider the context.<a name=408:13></a> J.<a name=408:14></a>N.<a name=408:15></a>D.<a name=408:16></a> in translating this word for worship says, "did him homage", not "worshipped".<a name=408:17></a> In <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#19:10">Revelation  19:10</a>, the same word is used; the apostle John was forbidden by the angel who said, "See thou do it not.<a name=408:18></a> I am thy fellow-bondman .<a name=408:19></a>.<a name=408:20></a>.<a name=408:21></a> Do homage to God".<a name=408:22></a>

		Here in Matthew, we are to have in mind that the Lord Jesus is to be an Object of worship to man.<a name=409:1></a> The magi say, "Where is the king of the Jews that has been born?<a name=409:2></a> for we have seen his star in the east, and have come to do him homage".<a name=409:3></a> This is to emphasise that He is the Son of God, a divine Person, and is to be worshipped.<a name=409:4></a> The use of the word "worship" is an important matter.<a name=409:5></a> The man in <a href="../bible/John.htm#9">John  9</a>had gone a long way in his soul, and they had already cast him out when he meets the Lord, and in answer to His question, "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?<a name=409:6></a>" he says, "I believe, Lord", and he did Him homage.<a name=409:7></a> The woman at the well in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>used the word ' worship ' in relation to public worship in a general way; that is the usual idea of worship, which has reference to a place, whether here or there, in a public sense.<a name=409:8></a> What is before us is not that, but whether the Lord Himself is apprehended by us, so that we are brought to worship from our hearts.<a name=409:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"They shall call his name Emmanuel" which means "God with us" is a presentation of the Lord which would enter into what we are considering.<a name=409:10></a> So here, these magi may not have been able to say much, but they apprehended in their souls who He was.<a name=409:11></a> The Lord Himself deals with these impressions of the soul, impressions that get expressed in time.<a name=409:12></a> Take David, for instance, as a young man he was a thoughtful person and had gained right impressions which came out later in his life.<a name=409:13></a> Indeed the Spirit of God could say to Samuel, "Arise, anoint him; for this is he".<a name=409:14></a> Then later on the time came for the expression of all these precious impressions, and the Psalms testify what this man, David, had.<a name=409:15></a> He could say, "My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things which I have made touching the king; my tongue is the pen of a ready writer" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#45:1">Psalm  45:1</a>).<a name=409:16></a> He spoke thus of the impressions of his soul, of that One.<a name=409:17></a> So these magi had a definite impression and they say that this One

		The west is the territory of the assembly, that is, the spreading of Japheth, while the east is Shem, or heathendom, which, no doubt, will be evangelised later (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#14:6">Revelation  14:6</a>) by the "angel flying in mid-heaven, having the everlasting glad tidings".<a name=410:9></a> It no doubt refers to that day when ten men will take hold of the skirt of one Jew.<a name=410:10></a> The Jew will then be honoured.<a name=410:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#1:21">Matthew  1:21</a>, "Thou shalt call his name Jesus, for <i>he</i> shall save his people from their sins".<a name=410:12></a> In the prophet Isaiah it is "Call his name Immanuel", God with us.<a name=410:13></a> "Jesus" is another title for ' Jehovah, the Saviour ', and both titles point to His deity, all to bring us to worship.<a name=410:14></a> Our impressions of Him are to be formed by how He is presented to us.<a name=410:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In Matthew Joseph is made much of, he is called a righteous man, -- it is the male side no doubt raised up by God to protect "the little child and his mother.<a name=410:16></a>" Joseph is thus a righteous man raised up for this purpose, to protect God's interests.<a name=410:17></a> The purpose of God must stand, so in Matthew all things must go through.<a name=410:18></a> In Matthew an angel rolls away the stone at the tomb of the Lord Jesus; it is not left to anyone, but a mighty angel does it.<a name=410:19></a> Again at the end, we have the word, "Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptising them" (chapter 28:19).<a name=410:20></a> The idea is that all <i>will</i> be done in spite of all opposition.<a name=410:21></a>

		Herod's influence here was a little unusual, it must be that the enemy was working through Herod.<a name=411:1></a> If we enquire of any of the denominations we would get answers, some good answers, but then we are dealing with a spiritual matter here.<a name=411:2></a> These men from the east were guided by heaven, and it is another matter, not like Herod's inquiry.<a name=411:3></a> He said "Go, search out accurately concerning the child .<a name=411:4></a>.<a name=411:5></a>.<a name=411:6></a> so that <i>I</i> also may come and do him homage", but he doesn't mean that; he has another thing in mind, as is plainly seen later on in his wicked act of killing the little children.<a name=411:7></a> The star for us today is heavenly light.<a name=411:8></a> ' Heavenly light makes all things bright ', as the hymn says.<a name=411:9></a> Matthew makes much of heaven and heavenly activity; he brings in the dominance of heaven in the ways of God.<a name=411:10></a> There must have been a work of God in these wise men for them to be able to say, "Where is the king of the Jews .<a name=411:11></a>.<a name=411:12></a>.<a name=411:13></a>?<a name=411:14></a> for we have seen his star".<a name=411:15></a> Nathanael was told to "come and see" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:47">John  1:47</a>), that is his message, and he <i>came</i> and when he came the Lord remarks about him.<a name=411:16></a> These wise men are the leading worshippers here in Matthew and show how God is starting that worship by men.<a name=411:17></a> These men in going to Jerusalem were on dangerous ground, and were warned by a dream to go back another way.<a name=411:18></a> It says, "they .<a name=411:19></a>.<a name=411:20></a>.<a name=411:21></a> went their way"; that just means that they followed the star -- "until it came and stood over the place where the little child was".<a name=411:22></a> The point is that following the guidance of heaven, they found Him.<a name=411:23></a> The star was leading them now, (they had lost that guidance while in Jerusalem), the same leading they had had in the east now leads them again, and they arrive at the place.<a name=411:24></a> When they saw the star "they rejoiced with exceeding great joy" -- and falling down they did Him homage.<a name=411:25></a> How ready they were to open their treasures!<a name=411:26></a> -- largeness of heart was theirs.<a name=411:27></a> When we are full of joy is the time to give.<a name=411:28></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The renewed mind spoken of later on by Paul, is a trained mind.<a name=412:6></a> So our remembrance of the Lord Jesus in the breaking of bread is an act of mind with us, a mind trained to remember Him.<a name=412:7></a> It is the apprehension of Him as <i>thy Lord</i>, that is with us, so it is by a renewed mind.<a name=412:8></a> You come into the house to see Christ, in the circle where He is cared for.<a name=412:9></a> Our meetings here would plainly indicate that we are caring for what is of God.<a name=412:10></a> The child was possibly in Mary's arms, but they did not worship her, only Him.<a name=412:11></a> However near they may be, we do not worship the saints -- <i>Him</i> only; here they fell down and worshipped Him.<a name=412:12></a>

		They brought the right things, for they had the idea of worship in their minds all the time -- they came prepared and had gold, frankincense and myrrh.<a name=412:13></a> A certain attitude of mind is indicated here in their falling prostrate before Him -- all included in our idea of worship; only it is well to keep in mind the personal worth of this <i>Person</i>, The Person of Christ is to be kept in mind all through Matthew, as the Object of veneration and worship of our souls.<a name=412:14></a> The heavenly light of the star led these men to Christ, and with the further command to return "another way", the instruction to them is finished.<a name=412:15></a> They returned, they were good assembly men.<a name=412:16></a> The gold they brought represents what is of God, supreme among metals.<a name=412:17></a> The frankincense is fragrance; the myrrh, suffering, coming with the idea of excellence, lifting us out of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have before us Zacharias and Elizabeth, both being of the priestly family.<a name=414:1></a> What is in mind is that, whilst the service of God is carried on in outward order -- Zacharias serving as priest in his order -- yet we are to see that he was not actuated by faith.<a name=414:2></a> Nor was the service, although carried out in normal outward order, in the power of the Spirit.<a name=414:3></a> Yet, later on, in verse 67 -- he is said to be filled with the Holy Spirit and addresses God.<a name=414:4></a> This is characteristic of Luke, -- Luke, as ever full of grace providing us with the thought that while Zacharias was not acting in faith, he was one who <i>could</i> be recovered or secured through discipline, that is, there was hope there.<a name=414:5></a> According to Malachi, who speaks of the state of things to which the Lord came in Israel, there was a state of unbelief, not hopeless, for the work of God was there, only needing rebuke and adjustment.<a name=414:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Luke always recognises the powers that be, the state of humility that enters into a recognition of his position.<a name=414:7></a> He begins by saying, "in the days of Herod the king", -- and again, "in those days .<a name=414:8></a>.<a name=414:9></a>.<a name=414:10></a> a decree went out", and "when Cyrenius had the government of Syria".<a name=414:11></a> It is a principle of Luke's writings that God has set up provisional government, and that in whosesoever hands it be, it is to be recognised.<a name=414:12></a> So we are to recognise that the testimony requires that -- nothing more is in mind than that.<a name=414:13></a> Herod was not favoured by the Jews.<a name=414:14></a> The Spirit of God recognises public order with those in authority, whether it be Caesar, Pilate, or any other; God recognises them, and so should we.<a name=414:15></a> Peter who recognises the government of God much in his writing and experience, enjoins us to be subject to the king and to governors.<a name=414:16></a> The great highways of Rome are in mind in Paul's travels; "walk to and fro through

		Luke begins with these two persons, Zacharias and Elizabeth.<a name=416:3></a> They had been real in their prayers, and though there was unbelief, there was hope there too.<a name=416:4></a> Often if we would just be patient, we would see that there is hope there.<a name=416:5></a> They represent the gracious operation of God in a hopeful case.<a name=416:6></a> With Simeon and Anna, there is no delinquency shown in their case, so they are not rebuked.<a name=416:7></a> On the other hand we need to see that Zacharias was carrying on with what God had set up, and externally was supported by God.<a name=416:8></a> The angel appears at the <i>right</i> side of the altar, which would speak of all the power of heaven on their side.<a name=416:9></a> But the answer to him when he says, "How shall I know this?<a name=416:10></a>" is, "<i>I</i> am Gabriel, who stand before God, and I have been sent to speak to thee".<a name=416:11></a> We see he is gracious but severe; what follows is very severe: "because thou hast not believed my words, the which shall be fulfilled in their time".<a name=416:12></a> There are hopeful cases, and such a case is proved in Zacharias himself.<a name=416:13></a> If God is working at all, He works in hopeful ones.<a name=416:14></a> God recognises piety with these two, as in verse 6, "both just before God".<a name=416:15></a> Gabriel does not reprove Zacharias until Zacharias expresses unbelief.<a name=416:16></a> Zacharias had been praying for a son, and if you pray for a son you are praying for the continuance of the testimony in good hands.<a name=416:17></a> So it is that Gabriel appears in the temple, not Zacharias' house, but in connection with God's interests.<a name=416:18></a> It is very gracious of God to go on with him in this way, hence the seriousness of Zacharias' doubting -- it is unbelief in God's power to do what He promises.<a name=416:19></a> We can see in <a href="../bible/Zechariah.htm#3">Zechariah  3</a>that the angel of the Lord stood by; that is God's support of what He is going to do.<a name=416:20></a> In other places we are told what the angels are, all ministers sent out to minister to those who are heirs of salvation.<a name=416:21></a>

		The idea of the priesthood in Luke is linked on with Malachi, where we get a thought of priesthood not elsewhere set out, as Phinehas represents the idea of priesthood.<a name=417:5></a> So here Zacharias is seen praying for the continuing of the family priesthood, and he is a case of genuine recovery.<a name=417:6></a> He is a <i>real</i> priest now; his mouth is opened and tongue loosed and he speaks.<a name=417:7></a> That is true priesthood.<a name=417:8></a> Then he goes on to prophesy, bringing in the priest and prophet as one, being God's thought.<a name=417:9></a> So with us, if we accept the discipline, blessing will follow.<a name=417:10></a> It is remarkable, first he is a priest then he is a prophet.<a name=417:11></a> His priestly words are, "Blessed be the Lord", and the other is prophetic indeed.<a name=417:12></a> His discipline had been very severe, for the first thing a priest should be able to do is to speak, "the priest's lips should keep knowledge" (<a href="../bible/Malachi.htm#2:7">Malachi  2:7</a>).<a name=417:13></a> But Zacharias accepted it and he departed to his house.<a name=417:14></a> His house is involved, he went through peculiar exercise those nine months, and we may measure the depth to which he had gone, by the fruit of his lips afterwards.<a name=417:15></a> His is a great recovery, and if we are <i>really</i> restored, we shall add to what there is.<a name=417:16></a> It is a restored Jonah who writes the book of Jonah.<a name=417:17></a> These are hopeful cases, but we have examples also of certain hopeless cases, Simon Magus, King Agrippa, Pilate and others.<a name=417:18></a> Nicodemus and Nathanael were hopeful ones; with the latter, the Lord says, "before that Philip called thee" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:48">John  1:48</a>), indicating that the Lord saw something hopeful about him.<a name=417:19></a> Then the man in <a href="../bible/John.htm#9">John  9</a>was most hopeful, he was <i>sent</i>, and <i>went</i> and <i>came</i> seeing.<a name=417:20></a> When the Lord

		The family and neighbours were on natural lines here; they named the child Zacharias after his father, But Elizabeth says, "No; but he shall be called John".<a name=418:10></a> Then Zacharias <i>writes</i>, "John is his name".<a name=418:11></a> It is the writing of a dispensation.<a name=418:12></a> Then his mouth is opened and fear was upon all around.<a name=418:13></a> The idea of the writing is that there is a fixity, it is from God and cannot be altered.<a name=418:14></a> He is supported by God, his mouth is opened and the Holy Spirit comes upon him and he blesses God.<a name=418:15></a> It is the direct coming in of the Holy Spirit in the new dispensation.<a name=418:16></a> We can thus get the support of the Holy Spirit now as we adhere to right principles.<a name=418:17></a> The word is "An horn of salvation .<a name=418:18></a>.<a name=418:19></a>.<a name=418:20></a> in the house of .<a name=418:21></a>.<a name=418:22></a>.<a name=418:23></a> David" (not Aaron), that was of Christ and hence a prophetic word.<a name=418:24></a> Then Zacharias turns to the child and says, "And <i>thou</i>, child .<a name=418:25></a>.<a name=418:26></a>.<a name=418:27></a> " and there follows a beautiful tribute to Christ.<a name=418:28></a> So Zacharias in his prophetic word shows how clearly he is on spiritual lines, (John himself recognised the greatness of what God was doing by leaping before he was born) and showing the greatness of all that this word of God referred to.<a name=418:29></a>

		J.T.<a name=419:1></a> It has been thought necessary to consider Luke in two meetings as affording moral instruction as to our subject.<a name=419:2></a> In considering chapter 1 we see that the service of God was carried on by the true priest of the house of Aaron.<a name=419:3></a> The Spirit of God dwells on him, but it became evident by the incoming of an angel when he was serving, that he was unbelieving as to his own prayers.<a name=419:4></a> But he was a hopeful case.<a name=419:5></a> He was restored, and in his recovery he had more than he ever had before.<a name=419:6></a> He was not only a priest of the house of Aaron, but the Holy Spirit came upon him so that he could prophesy.<a name=419:7></a> All this points to the door of another dispensation; God coming in in grace, and John the baptist was to prepare the way of the Lord.<a name=419:8></a>

		It is thought that chapter 2 represents a perfect state of things in those who are brought into the service.<a name=419:9></a> There were no discrepancies in the shepherds, Simeon or Anna.<a name=419:10></a> The shepherds were abiding without, keeping watch over their flock by night.<a name=419:11></a> "An angel of the Lord was there by them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them".<a name=419:12></a> Then when we come to Simeon, he is already a priest in the true sense, but he is not said to be a priest after the order of Aaron.<a name=419:13></a> He was a characteristic man of Jerusalem, "just and pious, awaiting the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him".<a name=419:14></a> So that we are now at the door of a new dispensation.<a name=419:15></a> Zacharias comes into the real priesthood and authentic ministry by the Spirit, and now Simeon, although not said to be a priest after the order of Aaron, is really a priest as the Holy Spirit is upon him.<a name=419:16></a> "It was divinely communicated to him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death before he should see the Lord's Christ".<a name=419:17></a> So that we have a man now in the power of the Spirit.<a name=419:18></a>

		THE SERVICE OF GOD IN THE FOUR GOSPELS (4)
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=427:1></a> The subject of the service of God, coming before us from the four evangelists, should be regarded as bearing on ourselves, bearing on the service of God as known now and carried on in a measure.<a name=427:2></a> In Matthew we have the idea of worship in a personal sense.<a name=427:3></a> The magi had in mind to worship the King of the Jews.<a name=427:4></a> They were evidently genuine as bringing with them what was required for the service.<a name=427:5></a> The priesthood does not arise simply from the house of Aaron but worshippers were coming in from among the gentiles.<a name=427:6></a> They were to worship the King of the Jews.<a name=427:7></a> In Luke the worship of God among the Jews is being carried on, only the service is conducted by one who is the true priest according to the Jewish economy, but defective in faith.<a name=427:8></a> But nevertheless, the service is being carried on according to the principles governing it and heaven intervenes to help.<a name=427:9></a> It is another phase of our position.<a name=427:10></a> So that we reach in Luke the principle of recovery, divine help coming in, the thought of worship according to God, the service of God as we have it.<a name=427:11></a> Persons who are not seen as Levites or priests are really the true priests.<a name=427:12></a> This is a point that ought to be taken into account.<a name=427:13></a> Their qualifications are seen in their spiritual ability.<a name=427:14></a> That is Simeon and Anna.<a name=427:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, we have to consider John; how he is introduced into the service of God bears on the present position.<a name=427:16></a> It is hardly touched upon until we come to this chapter, and the subject is introduced by a Samaritan.<a name=427:17></a> It was one of mongrel race, not only conventionally but religiously, for we are told in the second book of Kings when the ten tribes were taken captive by the Assyrians, five nations were transplanted into Samaria, each having its own religion, but nominally fearing Jehovah.<a name=427:18></a>

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=428>[Page 428]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now it is out of that that we get the introduction of worship, this woman being of that mongrel condition.<a name=428:1></a> There were five nations and she had had five husbands.<a name=428:2></a> John also introduces five porches in Bethesda.<a name=428:3></a> But the moving of the water was only "at a certain season".<a name=428:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is important to notice here the setting of this phase of our subject.<a name=428:5></a> The end with the woman is reached in connection with prophecy, the prophetic word, and then the woman speaks about worship.<a name=428:6></a> He said to her, "Thou hast had five husbands", and according to her own report, He told her all things that she had ever done.<a name=428:7></a> It brings in self-judgment.<a name=428:8></a> Prophetic ministry exposes your condition.<a name=428:9></a> The subject of worship is introduced by this woman, but the Lord does not spurn the introduction by her of this deep truth; He speaks about it.<a name=428:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.D.<a name=428:11></a> The desire of the woman would be the water apart from this question of self-judgment, would it not?<a name=428:12></a> But the desire of the Lord is to hear all that is in her heart.<a name=428:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=428:14></a> The conversation is remarkable.<a name=428:15></a> The Lord as seen at the end of chapter 3 has received all things from the Father, as the Son that is loved.<a name=428:16></a> So that it is between the Father and the Son; "the Father loves the Son and has given all things to be in His hand.<a name=428:17></a>" The Lord is seen in this chapter as on that line, the way of love; He possessing all things from the Father.<a name=428:18></a> So that now it is a question of whether we have arrived in the history of the testimony in this dispensation at this basic setting.<a name=428:19></a> I think the Lord has helped us greatly as to Sonship and Fatherhood.<a name=428:20></a> This chapter brings out the working of it; not simply the family thought but the administrative thought.<a name=428:21></a> The two Persons, the Father and the Son operate -- the Father, the Source of all and the Giver of all, and the Son, the Blesser and the Administrator.<a name=428:22></a> Love between Them operates.<a name=428:23></a> He sat just as He was at the well as if to take up the attitude of bringing out something; which happened.<a name=428:24></a> We are told that, "Jesus therefore, being wearied with the way he had come,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.D.<a name=429:10></a> But the Lord says, "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that says to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water".<a name=429:11></a> Do you judge that what was in the mind of the Lord was that He is the Son who is loved by the Father?<a name=429:12></a> "Who it is" would be what is entirely personal.<a name=429:13></a> "If thou knewest".<a name=429:14></a> No one knows the Son but the Father, but if she had known who it was that was speaking to her, she would have asked of Him.<a name=429:15></a> He puts things on the basis of knowledge of a divine Person.<a name=429:16></a> What knowledge have I of divine Persons?<a name=429:17></a> That is the question.<a name=429:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.McA.<a name=429:19></a> Do you connect this with the statement you made in regard to the third chapter?<a name=429:20></a> All things are committed into the hands of the Son.<a name=429:21></a> He puts things on that basis; He was giving, He could give her living water: "If thou knewest .<a name=429:22></a>.<a name=429:23></a>.<a name=429:24></a> who it is.<a name=429:25></a>"

		In thinking on this meeting, I decided to present the gospel if I am enabled to do so, in connection with the four Simons; Simon the Pharisee, Simon Peter, Simon the Cyrenian and Simon the leper.<a name=460:1></a> Another Simon is mentioned in Scripture, but it would make the address too cumbersome to include him.<a name=460:2></a> One too might say that one likes to go on the principle of four.<a name=460:3></a> Scripture largely recognizes the numeral and uses it, and so I have selected these four men.<a name=460:4></a> I believe they are types usable and intended to be usable in God's service.<a name=460:5></a> For instance, the Pharisee represents our religious affiliations.<a name=460:6></a> Fishing represents employment which has to be taken account of in the gospel.<a name=460:7></a> The Cyrenian was coming up from the country, which is properly a field.<a name=460:8></a> He was a farmer of which there are many here in this room.<a name=460:9></a> The fourth does not seem to have any special calling.<a name=460:10></a> If he has, the Spirit of God does not mention it at all, but it does say that he is a leper.<a name=460:11></a> He is known to be that.<a name=460:12></a>

		Simon did not just invite the Lord to a meal.<a name=461:10></a> That is not condemned.<a name=461:11></a> But in his supercilious way, he "spoke with himself, saying, This person if he were a prophet would have known who and what the woman is who touches him, for she is a sinner".<a name=461:12></a> The Lord calls him by name; He does not say, ' Pharisee ', no, He says, "Simon".<a name=461:13></a> It is his personal name; it is not the name of his religious affiliation.<a name=461:14></a> That word Pharisee is not his name in the books of God; the word Simon is his name.<a name=461:15></a> And so the Lord said, "Simon", not ' Pharisee '.<a name=461:16></a> The Lord uses his given name, that in the books of God and in the books of men.<a name=461:17></a>

		I have been thinking, dear brethren, about light.<a name=469:1></a> It is one of the greatest suggestions that enters into this moment.<a name=469:2></a> Indeed, it is one of the greatest facts connected with our position here on earth, that we have light, and that light peculiarly enters into our convocations; and as it shines in the assembly, it shines in those who form it in their dwellings.<a name=469:3></a> So that we are told here in Exodus that whilst there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days, so that they saw not one another, yet all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.<a name=469:4></a> And Joseph's dream serves to show that light radiates in family connections.<a name=469:5></a> When God commanded light to shine out of darkness, there is no allusion to households.<a name=469:6></a> There were none.<a name=469:7></a> There were none, save as we may regard the universe as God's house.<a name=469:8></a> There is good ground for saying so, for it is said in connection with the house of God that He who built all things is God.<a name=469:9></a> "All things" is the universe.<a name=469:10></a> We have, indeed, in that epistle that I am alluding to, Hebrews, the fact that the worlds were framed by the word of God; "the worlds".<a name=469:11></a> That alludes to the universe too.<a name=469:12></a> "All things" would imply more detail than "the worlds".<a name=469:13></a> There are not as many worlds as there are things.<a name=469:14></a> But "all things" would point to the universe, and "the worlds" would point to subdivisions of the universe; each centred doubtless in a system, a stellar system, with a centre of attraction; suns and moons and stars.<a name=469:15></a> We are only acquainted, as I may say, in a physical sense with one of these systems, knowing, however, that there are others.<a name=469:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But we have the one great thought as to this -- the Father of lights.<a name=469:17></a> James, in his epistle, speaks of the Father of lights.<a name=469:18></a> There would be some allusion to the heavens, in a limited sense, no doubt, to our own sun, but in a wider sense to the Source of all light, which God

		is.<a name=470:1></a> He is the Father of lights; He dwells Himself in light unapproachable, we are told.<a name=470:2></a> So that we are impressed with this thought of light; it becomes very expanded as we meditate upon it.<a name=470:3></a> But it comes down to each of our dwellings.<a name=470:4></a> How each of Israel's households had light as connected with each other is a matter of interest, but it must have been spiritual.<a name=470:5></a> And what one is thinking of now is, as to the household just started, as it takes its place in a dwelling, inclusive of a building, a dwelling-place, that there should be indeed light in it.<a name=470:6></a> And so the wide allusion that I have made connects the household of each believer with a great central thought of light.<a name=470:7></a> There is only one Source of light, and that is God.<a name=470:8></a> He is the Father of lights.<a name=470:9></a> In <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>, as I was saying, there are no households in the sense in which we are speaking of them now, save the universe; and that is illuminated by God.<a name=470:10></a> But the urgency of it is seen in the use of the word "command".<a name=470:11></a> In <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:3">Genesis  1:3</a> it says, "And God said, Let there be light".<a name=470:12></a> For the stress is laid on the divine word in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>, but the divine word becomes a command when brought into the New Testament.<a name=470:13></a> Everything was regulated by the word of God.<a name=470:14></a> Peter stresses that as regards even the flood; "having its subsistence out of water and in water, by the word of God" (<a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#3:5">2 Peter  3:5</a>).<a name=470:15></a> Everything in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>has a fixity by the divine word, which carries with it more than command, because it carries wisdom.<a name=470:16></a> The mind of God is in it.<a name=470:17></a> "And God said, Let there be light.<a name=470:18></a> And there was light".<a name=470:19></a> He <i>said</i> it; a word that has to be carried down to our circumstances, because whilst the command is imperative, the word of God carries, as I said, wisdom and carries the mind of God.<a name=470:20></a> So that if I am in a given position, or a heavenly body is in a given position, it is not simply the divine fiat, but that the divine mind required that.<a name=470:21></a> And that makes everything more interesting, because each position occupied implies the skill of God; He said, and what came about from His word was good.<a name=470:22></a> Everything was good.<a name=470:23></a>

		I referred to Exodus, because the idea comes down to the house; to the believer's house.<a name=471:1></a> The Israelites, we are told, had light in <i>all</i> their dwellings.<a name=471:2></a> We find in the early part of this book of Exodus that God made houses for certain women.<a name=471:3></a> God was honouring them because they were saving the males in Israel, which the enemy would destroy.<a name=471:4></a> There can be no doubt that God intended to suggest in the making of houses (for the word is "made") that they should be a pattern in Egypt.<a name=471:5></a> God was honouring these persons; for certainly it was a great honour that He should make houses for women; and it is clear that the suggestion carried with it distinctiveness as to dwellings.<a name=471:6></a> They would not be mere coverings, mere shelters.<a name=471:7></a> They had the dignified word of "house".<a name=471:8></a> He made them <i>houses</i>.<a name=471:9></a> And whether these houses became patterns for the Israelites is not stated, but certainly one may assume that faith, as in persons like the mother of Moses and the father of Moses, would lead them to think of the houses God had made.<a name=471:10></a> They would be models of architecture for Israelites; not for Egyptians, but for Israelites.<a name=471:11></a>

		And these houses, if the thought may be carried into this verse, were suitable to God; and that is what one had in one's mind, that our dear brother and sister to whom we have already alluded with full commendation -- for they carry with them, I am sure, the full commendation of their brethren in this departure, in this new relationship into which they have entered -- that their household may be a household of light.<a name=471:12></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#87:2">Psalm  87:2</a> distinguishes between the gates of Zion -- that is, where judicial services were carried on among the saints, assembly service, the gates involving authority -- it distinguishes between the gates of Zion and the dwellings of Jacob.<a name=471:13></a> "Jehovah loveth the gates of Zion more than all the habitations of Jacob".<a name=471:14></a> But that infers that He did also love the dwellings of Jacob.<a name=471:15></a>

		There were no marriages, of course, in the ark; they were married couples -- four of them.<a name=473:5></a> No doubt their marriages would have been different from the ordinary corrupt marriages of the day, and their father had faith; Noah had faith, and God found pleasure in Noah and in his family.<a name=473:6></a> He prepared an ark for the saving of his house, and that saving implied cleansing; the washing of regeneration.<a name=473:7></a> Marriages before God can have no moral value save as these conditions exist -- the principle of purging as we get in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#4">Isaiah  4</a>.<a name=473:8></a> But it is here now with us, through grace, and the light of cleansing is with us; and this light is to enter into houses.<a name=473:9></a> So that Israel had light in all their dwellings, and that light involved the exclusion of impurities which marked the Egyptians.<a name=473:10></a> The darkness was all around; the darkness could be felt, but the Israelites had light in all their dwellings.<a name=473:11></a> And that light (as I was saying, for us it is purging) -- that light is connected by Joseph in his second dream with the sun, moon, and stars.<a name=473:12></a> I mean to say, not that he is making a point of light, but he is making a point of the sun, moon and eleven stars, meaning the household of his father.<a name=473:13></a> Incidentally, the point in the dream is that the household -- "the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me".<a name=473:14></a> That is the point he is making, for he is a type of Christ, and whatever authority is in the husband must be subservient to Christ's authority.<a name=473:15></a> Marriage is to be "in the Lord".<a name=473:16></a> That word "in" is power.<a name=473:17></a> It is a question of the power that is in Christ; the authority that is in Christ; marriage is "in the Lord".<a name=473:18></a>

		It is in my mind to speak about righteousness, one of the greatest subjects of Scripture.<a name=492:1></a> Matthew speaks of it more than all the other evangelists together, fifteen or sixteen times as compared with about twelve in the other three evangelists; obviously it is because he speaks of the assembly.<a name=492:2></a> Of course the others do also, but they do not name it formally, as Matthew does.<a name=492:3></a> Righteousness has a great place in relation to the assembly; of course it is a basic thought in the gospel and significantly Matthew stresses the sufferings of Christ on the cross by God.<a name=492:4></a> He deals with His extreme sufferings and with the sacrificial service of Christ.<a name=492:5></a> Matthew quotes the actual words which the Lord used on the cross: "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?<a name=492:6></a> .<a name=492:7></a>.<a name=492:8></a>.<a name=492:9></a> My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?<a name=492:10></a>".<a name=492:11></a> Matthew indicates the reason.<a name=492:12></a> It was a question of sin.<a name=492:13></a> It was a question of God dealing with sin in Christ.<a name=492:14></a> It was there upon Him vicariously.<a name=492:15></a> He is "separated from sinners, and become higher than the heavens" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#7:26">Hebrews  7:26</a>).<a name=492:16></a> It is entirely a case of the forsaking.<a name=492:17></a> He is said to have cried twice at the cross, expressing the deep feeling of our blessed Saviour, the Son of God, blessed for ever, in that He should cry as forsaken, God dealing in His infinite holiness with sins in Him.<a name=492:18></a> That was vicarious, so that the apostle Paul says: He was "made sin for us, that <i>we</i> might become God's righteousness in him" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:21">2 Corinthians  5:21</a>), not only to be accounted righteous, but to be made the righteousness of God, made that because He was made sin for us.<a name=492:19></a> So that this is fundamental; this proposition of the righteousness of God is all triumphant, it is manifest, not simply that it exists, it is manifested unto all, and upon all those that believe.<a name=492:20></a> It was said of Abraham that his faith was reckoned unto him as righteousness; it could only be
