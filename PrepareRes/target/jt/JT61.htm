		J.T.<a name=1:3></a> The intent is to call attention to these scriptures to show how the Lord reserves a time for occupation with the assembly as His bride; this over against Joseph who is not a man of leisure, but a man of affairs, who would come in at noon in the midst of his work, and we have the reference therefore in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#43">Genesis  43</a>to his readiness to occupy himself with these brothers, including Benjamin, as they came down from Canaan.<a name=1:4></a> It is said that he should come home at noon, being occupied as a man of affairs.<a name=1:5></a> Verse 16 says "Joseph saw Benjamin with them, and said to the man who was over his house, Bring the men into the house, and slaughter cattle, and make ready; for the men shall eat with me at noon".<a name=1:6></a> Now the verse of the first passage was read because it points to the Lord Jesus typically as having gone to heaven.<a name=1:7></a> Abraham and the young men who accompanied him went to Beer-sheba.<a name=1:8></a> It is said, "And Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba.<a name=1:9></a> And Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba".<a name=1:10></a> Because the verse does not note that Isaac came with his father to Beer-sheba, the type suggests that Christ has gone to heaven, and his relations with the assembly now are from heaven, and the verses in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24">Genesis  24</a>speak of Isaac being at Beer-lahai-roi.<a name=1:11></a> "Isaac had just returned from Beer-lahai-roi; for he was dwelling in the south country".<a name=1:12></a> That is, he is not engaged with anything special, and so he is preoccupied with Rebecca.<a name=1:13></a> It says, "Isaac had gone out to meditate in the fields toward the beginning of evening.<a name=1:14></a> And he lifted up his eyes and saw, and behold, camels were coming", meaning that

		he is occupied not so much with Rebecca as with the presence of the means by which she is carried, as if to remind us that the Lord is concerned as to whether we are being carried as part of the assembly or whether we are moving in relation to the power of nature, or according to human practice, or whether we are dependent on and separated by the Holy Spirit.<a name=2:1></a> The passage in chapter 26 only confirms this.<a name=2:2></a> Isaac is still seen at leisure, the word is 'dallying' with Rebecca, meaning that it is the time of affection, and the passage in Deuteronomy is to confirm further that the type requires that if a man takes a new wife he shall have a year of leisure.<a name=2:3></a> I hope these remarks will be intelligible.<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:5></a>W.<a name=2:6></a> Have you in mind that this covers the whole period of the assembly, or is it the Lord's particular service now?<a name=2:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:8></a> I should say it is the Lord's particular service now, while it is, typically, after the death of Israel.<a name=2:9></a> He is occupied with the assembly.<a name=2:10></a> This, of course, comes out in the period of the Lord's supper, it does not go on constantly, but in the period when the Supper is celebrated, the first day of the week.<a name=2:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:12></a>W.<a name=2:13></a> As over against other interests He is occupied with?<a name=2:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:15></a> Just so, in that it would be particularly worked out in a dispensational sense.<a name=2:16></a> He is not sitting on His own throne yet, He is sitting on the Father's throne.<a name=2:17></a> He is not ruling the world, nor Israel yet, He is devoted to the assembly, and hence the leisure that is suggested in these passages.<a name=2:18></a> Not that the Lord is not occupied with work, other scriptures would show that, but this scripture shows what I am speaking of, and involves an important feature of the truth.<a name=2:19></a> It may be that the brethren have not noticed that Isaac did not return from the place of his offering up, in death typically, but it is a fact

		that it is not recorded that he returned with his father and the men to Beer-sheba.<a name=3:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		T.B.<a name=3:2></a> What are we to understand by that, that Isaac does not return with Abraham?<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:4></a> Well, the reference would be to the ascension, as spoken of in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24">Luke  24</a>, and <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>and in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>, and in Mark.<a name=3:5></a> The testimony to the ascension is very full, and the assembly is supposed in the typical books and apostolic letters to be involved in the Lord's ascension.<a name=3:6></a> She goes up with him.<a name=3:7></a> That is to be understood mysteriously, but it is a fact.<a name=3:8></a> According to Revelation the man child goes up to heaven and it is intelligible that the assembly goes, too, because she is not in the persecution, she is taken out of the way.<a name=3:9></a> He says in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3">Revelation  3</a>that He will keep us from the great tribulation.<a name=3:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.E.<a name=3:11></a>B.<a name=3:12></a> Do we assemble ourselves together to break bread with the fact in mind that the Lord is in heaven?<a name=3:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:14></a> The more accurate thought would be that He is rejected here.<a name=3:15></a> He is in heaven, it is true, but it is that He is rejected here that should be in our minds.<a name=3:16></a> "The stone which they that builded rejected, this has become the corner-stone".<a name=3:17></a> (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#21:42">Matthew  21:42</a>; <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#12:10">Mark  12:10</a>; <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#20:17">Luke  20:17</a>; see also <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#118:22">Psalm  118:22</a>)

	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=3:18></a> Is it your thought that Rebecca is typical of the assembly in a peculiar way as ministering to the affections of Christ?<a name=3:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:20></a> Just so.<a name=3:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=3:22></a> So that He is peculiarly engaged with her in a leisurely way?<a name=3:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:24></a> That is a good way to put it, in a leisurely way; hence the word in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#26">Genesis  26</a>(in the Darby Translation) is "dallying" not 'sporting' (as used in the Authorised Version) It is hardly in keeping with the position; the word 'sport' is hardly suitable, but 'dallying' is quite intelligible.<a name=3:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.E.<a name=3:26></a>B.<a name=3:27></a> Does dallying convey the idea of union?<a name=3:28></a>

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:1></a> Just so, and perfect familiarity in the sense of union.<a name=4:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.C.<a name=4:3></a>E.<a name=4:4></a> Is this the assembly's position as ascended with Christ or here?<a name=4:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:6></a> As ascended with Christ.<a name=4:7></a> That is the idea.<a name=4:8></a> The position of the assembly now is ascension.<a name=4:9></a> We are not only raised with Christ but we are ascended.<a name=4:10></a> Colossians speaks of our being raised with Him through faith of the operation of God.<a name=4:11></a> That is, a person who is baptised not only goes into the water, but comes out of it, a figure of resurrection, but Ephesians gives you that, and tells us that we are raised up <i>together</i>, and made to sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus.<a name=4:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=4:13></a> Had the Lord this in mind in His ministry to Mary Magdalene when He said, "I ascend to my Father, and your Father, and to my God, and your God"?<a name=4:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:15></a> That is just the point.<a name=4:16></a> The fact of ascension is not stressed there, but it is simply He would ascend, or rather the truth "I ascend".<a name=4:17></a> Not exactly the tense but the fact.<a name=4:18></a> It is a fact that He does ascend.<a name=4:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.E.<a name=4:20></a>B.<a name=4:21></a> Does the thought of "dallying" convey the idea of responsive affections between Christ and the assembly?<a name=4:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:23></a> That is right, and all the liberty and latitude that belongs to the position.<a name=4:24></a>

		Ques.<a name=4:25></a> Should the quickening in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2">Ephesians  2</a>give us the affections that would take advantage of this leisure time?<a name=4:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:27></a> Well, the Philistine king saw this liberty that Isaac had with Rebecca, and that Rebecca had with him, and he discerned the fact she was his wife and not his sister.<a name=4:28></a> Now we are in a wealthy position.<a name=4:29></a> The word 'spouse' does involve the marital relation, but not all of it, and therefore when Isaac said she was his sister that was a denial of the truth.<a name=4:30></a> We are related to Christ in the sense of the wife.<a name=4:31></a> The

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.E.<a name=5:2></a>B.<a name=5:3></a> Does this follow on chapter 24, "Isaac led her into his mother Sarah's tent .<a name=5:4></a>.<a name=5:5></a>.<a name=5:6></a> and she became his wife, and he loved her"?<a name=5:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:8></a> That is just the fact.<a name=5:9></a> In chapter 26 he said she was his sister, whereas she was his wife.<a name=5:10></a> That is the important thing for us to understand; that is that we are united to Christ now as much as we shall ever be, and hence the possibilities of the assembly service at the present time.<a name=5:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=5:12></a> Is it necessary to understand what is involved in what is said that when the servant said "it is my master", she took a veil and covered herself?<a name=5:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:14></a> Well, that was becoming, as if she would say, 'I do not want my beauty to be exposed to others' -- she reserved it for Isaac.<a name=5:15></a> That is our suitability.<a name=5:16></a> It is said constantly, as in such as Abigail she was a woman of great beauty and good understanding, and so was Rebecca.<a name=5:17></a> She is said to be of beauty, her personal appearance is involved.<a name=5:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=5:19></a> She would reserve that for Isaac alone.<a name=5:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:21></a> That is what I understand, that is why she took a veil, but what is suggested is that we are not always carried by the Spirit, and that is why I believe the Lord here (Isaac) notes the fact that camels were coming.<a name=5:22></a> We might have thought that he saw Rebecca coming, she saw Isaac, but he saw the camels, meaning she was carried by the proper power.<a name=5:23></a> Hence all the systems of Christendom are shut out.<a name=5:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=5:25></a> Is it not in measure as we know what it is to be carried by the camels, that we know what it is to see Isaac, and we are prepared to spring off the camels?<a name=5:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:27></a> Yet she is perfectly in keeping with the position in her movements and acts, which are in order and suitable and seemly, and the Lord is

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		pleased with how she has been carried to Him.<a name=6:1></a> There are many who are not carried by the Spirit, but are carried along by creeds and religious systems.<a name=6:2></a> Every believer has Him as the gift of God, and should use Him in relation to our approach and journey to Christ.<a name=6:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=6:4></a> This great matter of taking a wife for Isaac began with the father, Abraham, and he made a provision, sending out the camels and so forth.<a name=6:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:6></a> That is good, so what we find is the servant -- the chief one of his house, he is not called Eliezer in this chapter, he is just the chief servant of Abraham, and Abraham does not tell him what to do, he takes the camels himself, and is in complete charge of all that his master has.<a name=6:7></a> The position is thus very full, and very free from any human reservation and restriction; it is a sphere of freedom, the freedom of the Spirit.<a name=6:8></a> The Spirit is typified in the servant, and the camels, and therefore it is a time of liberation.<a name=6:9></a> The Spirit is also typified in the well by which Rebecca watered the camels, and the men.<a name=6:10></a> The well at Beer-lahai-roi is also a type of the Spirit.<a name=6:11></a> It is a very full position of spiritual power, and we should avail ourselves of it, and not be struggling with human systems and money and the like.<a name=6:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.O.<a name=6:13></a> Is it possible in accepting the light we are not carried by the Spirit?<a name=6:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:15></a> That is true, sadly true, and so we may be found making the ordinary customs of the brethren just a means of carrying us along, and the power is not there.<a name=6:16></a> Paul said he had the power, and that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us.<a name=6:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=6:18></a> The Lord, speaking to the disciples of the Spirit coming, said, "He shall take of mine and shall shew it unto you".<a name=6:19></a> Was that the same thing as what is said of the servant?<a name=6:20></a> He takes the camels, without having been told to do so.<a name=6:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:22></a> I had been thinking that.<a name=6:23></a> There is a peculiar

		liberty that is attached to the position; the Spirit here to serve, He is sent down from heaven, yet He is a divine Person, and He has to be apprehended as a divine Person, and yet serving in obedience.<a name=7:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.A.<a name=7:2></a>W.<a name=7:3></a> In verse 61 it emphasises that "they rode upon the camels, and followed the man.<a name=7:4></a> And the servant took Rebecca".<a name=7:5></a> Is that as being available to the Spirit He takes her on?<a name=7:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:7></a> Just so.<a name=7:8></a> There is a remarkable amount of latitude in the fact that the man led her, and she followed him.<a name=7:9></a> The type carries so much that it suggests the Spirit, and the power of the Spirit to us.<a name=7:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.E.<a name=7:11></a>B.<a name=7:12></a> And as following the man she moves in a comely way, thinking of the way in which she springs from the camel and took a veil and veiled herself.<a name=7:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:14></a> Like Abigail, who hasted and lighted off her ass.<a name=7:15></a> The power of the Spirit is a spring in our souls.<a name=7:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.J.<a name=7:17></a>T.<a name=7:18></a> That is contrary to what is found in Christendom.<a name=7:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:20></a> That is just the point.<a name=7:21></a> We are to be set aside and be in the true light and liberty of this chapter.<a name=7:22></a> What is said about Joseph is also important.<a name=7:23></a> He came in at noon.<a name=7:24></a> He was a man of affairs.<a name=7:25></a> The Lord will be a man of affairs presently.<a name=7:26></a> God has fixed the day when He will rule the world.<a name=7:27></a> He will judge the world, and the Lord will take on the rule of the world, whose right it is.<a name=7:28></a> It is His right.<a name=7:29></a> The powers that be are of God, and in that position, but only provisionally.<a name=7:30></a> And the saints, the assembly, are to be with Him in that rule.<a name=7:31></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.M.<a name=7:32></a>T.<a name=7:33></a> In chapter 22 the suggestion is that Isaac is the ascended one, now in chapter 24 he is dwelling in the south country.<a name=7:34></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:35></a> Well, that is another setting of the position.<a name=7:36></a> Although ascended into heaven we cannot say He is always stationary, for He tells us in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>, "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you".<a name=7:37></a> That would be involved in what we said; He is not stationary.<a name=7:38></a>

		W.W.<a name=8:3></a> Is that seen in the Song of Songs?<a name=8:4></a> "Behold, he cometh, leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills".<a name=8:5></a> Does that suggest the time He has to spend?<a name=8:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:7></a> Very good.<a name=8:8></a> "I am coming to you" is very full of meaning.<a name=8:9></a> He would not leave us dependent upon what the ordinary religious societies depend upon.<a name=8:10></a> He is coming for us, too.<a name=8:11></a> We have to distinguish between His coming to us as in assembly and at other times, too.<a name=8:12></a> <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15">1 Corinthians  15</a>tells us of the many times in which the Lord appeared to His own, first to Cephas, then to the twelve, then He appeared to about five hundred brethren at once, then He appeared to James, then to all the apostles, and then to Paul, showing that the Lord has latitude at the present time in the activities of His love.<a name=8:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:14></a>W.<a name=8:15></a> Are you linking that up with the south country?<a name=8:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:17></a> Yes, it is a favourable country, not like the north where things are adverse, everything is favourable in this chapter.<a name=8:18></a> You are impressed with the wealth.<a name=8:19></a> Abraham disappears and Isaac is called the master in the end.<a name=8:20></a> Isaac is all.<a name=8:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		T.G.<a name=8:22></a> The expression in verse 63, "toward the beginning of evening", is that suggestive of the anticipated time for leisure?<a name=8:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:24></a> Yes, but we must not leave Rebecca out of it, as to activity, because verse 61 says, "and Rebecca arose, and her maids, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man".<a name=8:25></a> That is to say the feminine side is stressed, not in Rebecca only, but her maids.<a name=8:26></a> We have the same thought in Abigail, she had maids, and so it is in the assembly's approach to the Lord.<a name=8:27></a> The feminine side is stressed, and this has to be understood in assembly service.<a name=8:28></a> It is not

		The first point is obvious; it occurs only in the second letter to the Thessalonians.<a name=18:5></a> Second apostolic letters are peculiar, and are usually to meet conditions arising immediately, which had not been arrived at in the first letters.<a name=18:6></a> The same applies to the gospel of Luke, which did not fill out what the writer had in mind, at least, according to his judgment; but afterwards he was helped in filling it out.<a name=18:7></a> Heaven knew; Luke was a servant, and heaven took him on again for a great service in writing to the same servant Theophilus, thinking that he would be gracious in looking into the matter of the truth of Christianity.<a name=18:8></a> So that second letters, such as this second epistle to the Thessalonians, are peculiar; the first was the proclamation of the gospel and the loveliness of the Thessalonian assembly, for the idea of the word 'assembly' had come into use.<a name=18:9></a> Until <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#14">Acts  14</a>the metropolitan idea had prevailed and was thought

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=27:14></a> Just so; the Lord orders things with a view to an end, even in a combination of circumstances, so that the Spirit preventing Paul had an end in mind which is seen in the next verse, "There was a certain Macedonian man, standing and beseeching him, and saying, Pass over into Macedonia and help us.<a name=27:15></a> And when he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go forth to Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to announce to them the glad tidings" (verses 9, 10); the end is no doubt Europe, for the working out of the truth of the assembly.<a name=27:16></a> So that all the previous history of Europe comes into this, the thought of 'spreading' in Japheth (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#5:32">Genesis  5:32</a>); that is as clear as it can be from the sequel.<a name=27:17></a> So the Lord's supper appearing in this particular chapter is undoubtedly to link up these matters.<a name=27:18></a> Verse 4 links on Paul's work, his own labours in these representatives; their localities are given; they are the produce of Paul's labours, and a living state of things is in

		J.T.<a name=39:8></a> That is exactly what is in mind; it is a question of where we are, viewed as the spouse of Christ, who, as we know, is engaged with the testimony of God.<a name=39:9></a> It is a continual matter with Him, and there are many, too, who are continually ministering the truth, preaching the word; but the question is how much is coming into evidence of the feminine thought of the assembly, for the primary thought is Christ and the assembly; the feminine feature is to be seen in her for ever, for she comes down as a bride adorned for her husband.<a name=39:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=83:1></a> I was thinking today that the Lord's supper seems to be divinely intended to be the centre of divine service.<a name=83:2></a> It is mentioned from the outset after the Spirit of God came down from heaven, the converts at Pentecost were said to have "persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:42">Acts  2:42</a>), with other things which are also said in that chapter.<a name=83:3></a> In verse 46 they broke bread in the house, which implies evidently they did not break bread in the temple, and we also are to understand that whilst the house is mentioned, the house as a dwelling-place of the saints is not exactly intended to be used as the meeting place of the saints, for the houses are differentiated in that they were to eat at home if it was a question of literally eating a meal.<a name=83:4></a> Paul says, "Have ye not then houses for eating and drinking?<a name=83:5></a>" So evidently the Lord's supper, whilst it is spoken of as being partaken of in houses as over against the temple, was intended to be partaken of in buildings such as are suitable for the saints to meet in, especially as it is said when the Lord ascended, those who saw Him go up returned and went to the upper room, not to the temple.<a name=83:6></a> So we have indication that the Lord's supper stood as the centre of the service of God.<a name=83:7></a> Other services might be linked on, but the Acts shows that the first day of the week was the day on which the Lord's supper was celebrated.<a name=83:8></a> These facts are important, and whilst not being formal, such as the ritual of the Old Testament was, there is certainly form and order connected with it and stressed, too, as this epistle shows.<a name=83:9></a> The subject of the Lord's supper is
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=151:1></a> The chapter is significant for it opens with the relationship of 'in-law', the father-in-law of Moses; it is one of the features of Exodus; it implies that this relation to Moses scarcely bore on the relationship of love, and yet was legal, so that the service of Moses was thus handicapped from the outset, as is often the case with gatherings and with servants, calling for a special intervention of God to put things right if administration is to be in mind.<a name=151:2></a> Had you thought of that?<a name=151:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=151:6></a> It is a great administrative book, and typically involves much in the ways of God with His people in government; so we need to take up all these things to understand what is in mind.<a name=151:7></a> There is the adverse attitude of Pharaoh, the attitude of the king to Moses himself, and how it is to be met; also his wife, as well as his father-in-law; and also that God had a mind to slay Moses, according to the next chapter.<a name=151:8></a> We need to take account of all these facts to see how God is seen in the book.<a name=151:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=151:10></a> The answer in the midwives was that they feared God.<a name=151:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=151:12></a> Yes; that is a keynote in the book; they had much to fear according to man, but not according to God; so faith is needed.<a name=151:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=152:4></a> That is the thing to see, to get the right point of view at the beginning in the reading of the book.<a name=152:5></a> So the circumstances in Midian bring out the position of Moses in a striking way; it says, "And Pharaoh heard of this matter, and sought to slay Moses.<a name=152:6></a> But Moses fled from before Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian.<a name=152:7></a> And he sat by the well.<a name=152:8></a> And the priest of Midian had seven daughters" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#2:15">Exodus  2:15</a>, 16); he sat by the well.<a name=152:9></a> You will have seen that?<a name=152:10></a>

		Ques.<a name=152:11></a> Do you think that these early chapters of Exodus have a parallel in that the Lord is about to take the assembly out of the world?<a name=152:12></a> So in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#1:8">Exodus  1:8</a> - 14, Pharaoh spoke roughly, and made the difference between the Egyptians and the children of Israel.<a name=152:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=152:14></a> I think so.<a name=152:15></a> It is also a type of millennial times, as well as our going out of Egypt; that is the <i>moral</i> phase, when we go out of the world through the Red Sea; and secondly, when we go from the wilderness into Canaan, which is a <i>spiritual</i> thought.<a name=152:16></a> They involve the dual phase of our position.<a name=152:17></a> Morally we are out of the world now; baptism and the Lord's supper suggest the means by which we go out; the heavenly side is seen in the Jordan.<a name=152:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=152:19></a> I am thinking of the aspect these things have in the world, and the parallel in spoiling the Egyptians of clothing, silver and gold; so we leave the world divested of all that is of value.<a name=152:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=152:21></a> It is a question of how we get at things morally; how do we ask for vessels and clothing?<a name=152:22></a> And then they have "favour in the eyes of the Egyptians", as it says in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#12:35">Exodus  12:35</a>, "And the children of Israel had done according to the word of Moses,

		and they had asked of the Egyptians utensils of silver, and utensils of gold, and clothing.<a name=153:1></a> And Jehovah had given the people favour in the eyes of the Egyptians, and they gave to them; and they spoiled the Egyptians".<a name=153:2></a> It seems to me all this is likely to affect us on the moral line; involving also the political situation, and the industrial and its many complications, and how the rights of God are to be asserted we <i>must</i> assert them.<a name=153:3></a> So the plagues become the opening up of God's moral rights over the Egyptians, as well as over His people.<a name=153:4></a>

		J.T.<a name=163:1></a> What has been suggested is a feature of the whole gospel; that is, the desire for learning and for instruction, the end being reached when Mary says to the Lord "Rabboni", that is to say her Teacher, to remind us that we are to restrict ourselves as to learning; it is to be confined to the Lord.<a name=163:2></a> Nathanael was a quick learner; so was the Magdalene; the Lord calls her 'Mary', showing His personal interest and knowledge of her, "Jesus says to her, Mary.<a name=163:3></a> She, turning round, says to Him in Hebrew, Rabboni, which means Teacher".<a name=163:4></a> In chapter 6 Peter says, "Lord, to whom shall we go?<a name=163:5></a> thou hast words of life eternal; and <i>we</i> have believed and known that <i>thou</i> art the holy one of God".<a name=163:6></a> That is to say, in his answer he recognised the Lord's priesthood, "words of life eternal", and that He was "the holy one of God", so that in his mind holiness was connected with priesthood.<a name=163:7></a> In <a href="../bible/Malachi.htm#2:7">Malachi  2:7</a> we have "For the priest's lips should keep knowledge".<a name=163:8></a>

		J.T.<a name=166:13></a> It would be like these readings we are having now; they have a great importance; we learn together; there <i>is</i> the thought of teaching; the Lord went up on high and gave gifts to men, as it says in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:10">Ephesians  4:10</a> - 12,"He that descended is the same who has also ascended up above all the heavens, that he might fill all things; and <i>he</i> has given some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints"; so that there is the idea of teaching; it is ability and gift; the shepherd and teacher is one gift.<a name=166:14></a> As in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:25">Hebrews  10:25</a> we are not to forsake "the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom is with some; but encouraging one another, and by so much the more as ye see the day drawing near".<a name=166:15></a> Let the young people get to the meetings; the shepherds and teachers would have them in mind, both brothers and sisters.<a name=166:16></a>

		J.T.<a name=191:5></a> It is indeed, and confirms what we are saying as to the thought of the spiritual and heavenly side of things being gradually brought to the front instead of the position being the outcome of Judaism.<a name=191:6></a> Because in due time Paul formally states in the second treatise of Luke, "Lo, we turn to the Gentiles".<a name=191:7></a> And again at the end of that book, "The salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and they will hear it".<a name=191:8></a> And, of course it has gone on on these lines ever since.<a name=191:9></a> So we find in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2">Ephesians  2</a>that the position of the Gentiles is formally recognised by itself as the habitation of God.<a name=191:10></a> "In whom <i>ye</i> also are built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit" (verse 22).<a name=191:11></a> Not, of course, setting aside the great thought of Jew and Gentile being formed into one body and one house, but the time had come to see that Christianity was coming on to its own footing.<a name=191:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=191:16></a> There was undoubtedly some feeling about it, but the Spirit of God overcame it.<a name=191:17></a> Although in the case of Barnabas and his nephew they left Paul -- you were referring, of course, to <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#15">Acts  15</a>-- the contention being so sharp, still the position is that Paul is being led forward.<a name=191:18></a> God is distinctively with him.<a name=191:19></a> And it is to set out the full position of Christianity, which is to take a westerly course.<a name=191:20></a> And so in chapter 16 we have the reference to the jailor and the vision made to Paul leading to the Greek world, "Come over into Macedonia, and help us".<a name=191:21></a> And so Paul's course was henceforward in that direction.<a name=191:22></a>

		J.T.<a name=202:1></a> The ministry of Paul and Barnabas is in mind in these scriptures, showing how Judaism is about to disappear, especially because it had refused the testimony of Stephen to Christ; and then, in general, it was because apostasy from the truth of Christianity already testified to by the twelve had begun; and then politically it was because murder appeared against the ministry, for Herod had slain James with the sword, and had already put Peter in prison, and would have slain him, too.<a name=202:2></a> Then in the evident purpose of God it was designed that Christianity should get its own name and character as devoid of Jewish terms, as in "the covenant" and such expressions.<a name=202:3></a> Hence "the disciples were first called Christians" here, and then there is the selection of Paul, in view of the divine counsels for him, particularly that he should complete the word of God.<a name=202:4></a> Thus we see the manifest rise of his personality, called by the Lord Himself "an elect vessel" unto Him; <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:15">Acts  9:15</a>.<a name=202:5></a> The time, too, had come for a revival, as well as an assertion of its distinctiveness as from heaven.<a name=202:6></a> Paul presents the heavenly side of the truth, and Barnabas was evidently called to be with him; and as commissioned by the Spirit they were seen in Antioch.<a name=202:7></a> They began ministering there, and it lasted for a year, the assembly being designated as the place of it; a large crowd became merged through their ministry, and became the assembly in Antioch.<a name=202:8></a> So that the Gentiles are in mind, and it is hoped we may see that it was all necessary and effective.<a name=202:9></a> <i>We</i> have thus come in; Judaism has gone, unless for a few outward things.<a name=202:10></a> At the same time the purpose of God stands, according to Romans, as Paul says, "and

		I purpose in reading these scriptures to seek to show what preparation is needed for the reception of the Holy Spirit.<a name=213:1></a> The whole of this first chapter could be read to enlarge on that point; for preparation is needed, and that preparation has to be regarded as the work of God, having, or characterised by, its own development, involving the new birth; but also the endings of the gospels, especially Mark, showing that much was needed to be done in this respect before the Lord died and after He rose.<a name=213:2></a> Mark shows the Lord's personal work, both what He did on earth, and after His resurrection; and how much had to be done!<a name=213:3></a> <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#16">Mark  16</a>tells us, as the others do, that the Lord arose, and we read in the early part of the chapter of certain things that indicated grave unbelief among those who should have been believers; even the women who had waited during the sabbath to embalm Him, were afraid as the young man in white spoke to them, "and they said nothing to any one, for they were afraid" (verse 8).<a name=213:4></a> So that if what was recorded up to this verse was all there was, it would be difficult to show that the Lord's work was a success.<a name=213:5></a> But then verse 9 shows that the Lord took the matter in hand, as He always does, as we fail in what is manifestly needed.<a name=213:6></a> So He appeared to Mary Magdalene, "out of whom he had cast seven demons", but the disciples failed, the apostles failed, they were unbelieving, and the Lord immediately rebuked them as they were eating at table in unbelief; reminding us of how little external advantage helps us, unless it is supported by the work of God, for I am dealing with things before the

		I read this passage because we have local positions where love is at home; heaven is <i>the</i> home of love, but so is the assembly, and so the Lord encourages the brethren at the beginning; He said much in those holy speeches to His own, as Paul did in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20">Acts  20</a>; we are not told what he said; it was a long speech, and "there were many lights in the upper room where the saints were assembled" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20:8">Acts  20:8</a>); and so it was the Lord carried on, but in greater variation, and His discourses are very full, and help us to form our own spheres for ministry and fellowship as we have it through Paul's ministry as outlined in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13">Acts  13</a>to 17.<a name=222:3></a> These are most instructive chapters if we are to work out Christianity in these days in our own company.<a name=222:4></a> That word 'company' in chapter 4: 23 is not in the original, and the omission of this makes the passage similar to the one in <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>, and helps me to call attention to Christianity as it is at the present moment.<a name=222:5></a>

		Now referring to the passage in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#4">Acts  4</a>that we are in now, it is common (though not ordinary), but prevalent, and more and more, for the brethren to have these holy scenes on Saturdays, when they are free to come together; I call attention to what is here now in this very town, this very hall, "And having been let go, they came to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them.<a name=225:3></a> And they, having heard it, lifted up their voice with one accord to God, and said, Lord, <i>thou</i> art the God who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that is in them" (verses 23, 24).<a name=225:4></a> You see how the Spirit of God puts into their mouths suitable expressions towards God, the Creator; He never loses this character; it will ever be a theme for us; and here are the brethren, where the opposition is, raising a note of praise, as we have today.<a name=225:5></a> Has He not heard it?<a name=225:6></a> I am sure that He has.<a name=225:7></a> Have we not enjoyed it?<a name=225:8></a> I am sure that we have.<a name=225:9></a> And the desire is to make these occasions more and more, and free from sin.<a name=225:10></a> So it goes on, "who hast said by the mouth of thy servant David, Why have the nations raged haughtily and the peoples meditated vain things?<a name=225:11></a> The kings of the earth were there, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ.<a name=225:12></a> For in truth against thy holy servant Jesus, whom thou hadst anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the nations, and peoples of Israel, have been gathered together in this city to do whatever thy hand and thy counsel had determined before should come to pass" (verses 25 - 28).<a name=225:13></a> How they

		J.T.<a name=229:1></a> It is thought that we might arrive at the truth concerning Christ and the assembly, and particularly now as to the Lord's coming to us.<a name=229:2></a> <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#22">Genesis  22</a>as a type contemplates the death and resurrection of Christ, but there is the additional fact that Isaac did not come down from the mount when he, as Christ in type, had been offered up, and from this it may be deduced that the Lord in His incoming to the assembly on earth in this period of testimony does not come physically, when we do, nor even in a spiritual sense, but He comes by Himself.<a name=229:3></a> Isaac not coming down with Abraham and his young men would intimate that the Lord is to be regarded in that section as in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>as coming from heaven, coming from above, and hence we have to see in the book of the Acts that we ourselves assemble by ourselves first, then He comes.<a name=229:4></a> We come from our ordinary affairs and assemble, as <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20">Acts  20</a>says, "we being assembled".<a name=229:5></a> We assemble without Him, but He comes according to <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>, "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you".<a name=229:6></a> The Spirit remains with us, even in assembly He is with us, and He is the power for all that we do, but the Lord comes.<a name=229:7></a> Therefore if there be assembling with Him it is as He comes in, and <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>shows that He does come and comes in spite of closed doors, that is to say, physical conditions do not affect His coming, so that it is said, "the doors shut", and again it is said that He came eight days after, to indicate the periodic character of His coming and how the facts indicate that we are in a certain position.<a name=229:8></a> The disciples were within in verse 19, "When therefore it was evening on that day, which was the first day of the week, and the doors shut

		where the disciples were through fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst", and then it is said, "the disciples rejoiced therefore, having seen the Lord".<a name=230:1></a> Then He says again to them, "Peace be to you: as the Father sent me forth, I also send you" -- so that evidently the facts related in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>linked on with the passage in Genesis would indicate that the outlook is ultimately testimony on earth, for He says in verse 21, "As the Father sent me forth, I also send you.<a name=230:2></a> And having said this, he breathed into them, and says to them, Receive the Holy Spirit: whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them; whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained", so that the outlook is ultimately for testimony on earth, whatever may ensue earlier as the Lord comes in.<a name=230:3></a> Hence the period of testimony as it proceeds affords opportunity for the Lord to come in, on the one hand, to conduct us into heavenly places; but, on the other hand, to fit us for testimony on earth.<a name=230:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=230:9></a> I am glad you mention that, for it indicates the difference in the two passages.<a name=230:10></a> In Luke it does not say He came, it just says He stood in the midst, as if He is ready for serving as needed, and there was much need.<a name=230:11></a> But in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>, He came and He says, "Peace be to you" twice, and then He speaks about His sending them and the Father sending Him and that they would have power to remit sins, so that the testimonial outlook is clearer in John, as if they were ready for it, whereas in Luke they were not ready, much had to be done, and hence He was there to do it.<a name=230:12></a>

		J.T.<a name=231:8></a> Well, Mary is just used, not officially; she is a sister, but I think she is more than a messenger, for she is an instructed person, which is in keeping with John's ministry.<a name=231:9></a> The whole of John's gospel is linked up with the idea of teaching.<a name=231:10></a> First, two disciples who came to Jesus from John the baptist enquire as to Him and as to the place of His teaching, "Where abidest thou?<a name=231:11></a>" They regarded Him as a teacher and the idea runs right through John's gospel, and I think at the present time it is culminating in the much instruction we are receiving and the ear for it, too.<a name=231:12></a> But then there is the official side and that is He is commissioning them as He was commissioned, and that commission extends to the forgiveness of sins, which would contemplate the gospel period.<a name=231:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=232:6></a> Yes, they go to the place of promise.<a name=232:7></a> The verse read (verse 19) says that Abraham returned to his young men, saying nothing about Isaac, but the facts show that Isaac had gone up and been offered up, he is viewed as dead and risen, but with the omission of what happened to him afterwards.<a name=232:8></a> There is a suggestion that he remained up there in keeping with what Abraham says in chapter 24, that he is not to be brought back to where Abraham came from; the wife, the spouse, would be found there, but he was not to be taken back there.<a name=232:9></a> So chapter 24 fits in with the position here.<a name=232:10></a> Rebecca is seen in chapter 22: 23, she is there.<a name=232:11></a> Abraham would have in mind that the chief servant of his house should go and find her and he brings her back and Isaac is in the field coming from the well at which God appeared to Hagar.<a name=232:12></a> Isaac is seen there, and he is meditating in the fields coming and going, as we might say, from that well, as if his mind is on the Spirit in the type.<a name=232:13></a> Then he is looking for the camels, as if to suggest that he is thinking of what power is carrying the assembly and all that enters into the present moment as to the assembly's position, the power by which she is carried to Isaac, the power by which she is maintained in testimony.<a name=232:14></a>

		J.T.<a name=233:22></a> Yes, the power of remission is in the assembly.<a name=233:23></a> John does not mention the word 'assembly' as we know, but we are entitled to speak of it, for the teaching of remission, and all that enters into it as to redemption, has been current in the assembly from the very outset.<a name=233:24></a> John has a prophetic character and the idea of teaching comes in, for there is so much need of it.<a name=233:25></a> Thousands of people are suffering from the want of teaching; the teaching implies that the assembly has power to remit sins.<a name=233:26></a>

		These scriptures have been selected, among other things, because of their brevity and conciseness, in view of the time at our disposal, and what is before us is to see the place blessing has in all the ways of God, but particularly in those ways of His that relate to His immediate family.<a name=245:1></a> The passage in Genesis is read to call attention to it, in the line of Abraham.<a name=245:2></a> Of Isaac it is said that he blessed both Jacob and Esau.<a name=245:3></a> What is in my mind now, however, is his blessing of Jacob, who is in the immediate line of blessing; Esau was in a more distant line, and ultimately lost the blessing, even the one he earnestly sought for and received, such as it was, but the line of blessing, the blessing of Abraham is very full and rich, I need not say, and it is continuous, even in our own times.<a name=245:4></a> The continuity of blessing obviously is seen amongst the brethren, it is unmistakable, and what is in mind now is that it should be continued and increased.<a name=245:5></a> Jacob's position in the chapter read is significant in this respect, because the blessing he received at the hands of Isaac may be regarded by many as undeserved, and such thought gives rise to the need of calling attention to depth and how we may be mistaken by appearances and by superficial evidences in these matters, because Isaac was himself hardly (at the outset of the facts related) equal to blessing others.<a name=245:6></a> In truth it would seem that he needed to be blessed himself, which is often the case in persons whom God has called into His testimony, and hence mistakes may be made, if we judge superficially, because the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.<a name=245:7></a> So here Isaac was the vessel of blessing, whatever the outward appearances were,

		and whatever may be said about Rebecca and about Jacob himself, God is adhering to His own line of thought, His own purposes, and hence when the time arrived Isaac is able to smell, and smell aright; he is able to use his senses aright, which would mean that God helped him to bless his son Jacob.<a name=246:1></a> The time had come for it, and so after considerable thought he says, "Come near now, and kiss me, my son".<a name=246:2></a> That is, the time had come for it, and whatever the appearances, the smell was not inaccurate, although superficial, but at the depth and root it was not, and so his father Isaac said unto him, "Come near now, and kiss me, my son.<a name=246:3></a> And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the Lord hath blessed".<a name=246:4></a> There is no doubt about it, the smell was there, the smell of potential blessing, the root was there, the root of promise was there, and so the blessing came, and hence, as I was remarking, the idea runs right through the family of Abraham, and by extension through the family of God.<a name=246:5></a>

		and the word will be, "What hath God wrought!<a name=249:1></a>" "At this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!<a name=249:2></a>" So that we may be encouraged when we look back at chapter 30 of Genesis, the birth of the tribes and all the vicissitudes of those days, all the sorrow that lay across the history, that ultimately, the word would be as to Israel and Jacob, "What hath God wrought!<a name=249:3></a>" We are now in the time of God's work, dear brethren, and it is proceeding, let nobody think it is not, for it is steadily proceeding.<a name=249:4></a>

		And we come down to our own times, I mean to the New Testament times, and therefore I read from Luke.<a name=249:5></a> In one way Luke is the most encouraging of all because his thought in the gospel is to present grace, and to show that God goes on in spite of any wickedness that can be asserted, or sought to be proved.<a name=249:6></a> We must not be in a hurry or ill at ease to prove evil.<a name=249:7></a> So the Lord tells the disciples that repentance and remission of sins are to be preached "among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem", that is a wonderful thing in Luke, when you think of the wickedness of the race, right up to the present time, what wickedness, and how it is increasing, and yet these words stand, repentance and remission of sins preached to "all the nations beginning at Jerusalem".<a name=249:8></a> So that we have much latitude in whatever we may be engaged in in our little meetings, our little preachings, on Sunday evenings, and our Bible readings in country places, big cities too, at times very feeble, yet the work of God goes on in power in them, we may be sure of that, because they are based on right principles.<a name=249:9></a> God has a great regard for principle, He will pass over much in a certain way in order to confirm and commend right principles.<a name=249:10></a> And so, as I said, Luke is more encouraging in one sense than any other of the evangelists, because he asserts grace and he asserts it in the sense of reigning: the idea

		of reigning is in the Scriptures, the reign of grace is emphatic, there is no thought of any modification at all.<a name=250:1></a> If we are to think of grace we ought to think of it and learn to bathe ourselves in it because it is grace, "by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God", these are the wonderful words of Ephesians.<a name=250:2></a> And they fit now as they did at the beginning.<a name=250:3></a> And so Luke, as I said, would stress the idea of grace, "and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations beginning at Jerusalem"; these were the Lord's own words.<a name=250:4></a> The very acme of the position in Luke is in chapter 15.<a name=250:5></a> We can never go too often to that chapter; and one might say, it should be a well-beaten track, the track of <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15">Luke  15</a>, as we call it, to the prodigal.<a name=250:6></a> Sometimes we use the word 'prodigality', and no doubt it is in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15">Luke  15</a>, where we get the magnificence of grace, the magnanimity of it.<a name=250:7></a> How it fits wherever there is a poor sinner, one who has found it out what he is and, you might say, he knows it, for the work of God has brought him to it.<a name=250:8></a> I am not speaking now of the thought of forgiveness by the Father, I am speaking of the work of the Spirit in the new birth, one of the greatest things to keep in mind, the new birth, the underlying great fact that is current, souls being brought into being in the sense of the new birth, born again, born, we may say, throughout; it is a total matter, and hence is the foundation of the whole structure of Christianity.<a name=250:9></a> We are to learn to delight in that.<a name=250:10></a> It may not be the full thought, but I am speaking now of the idea that the Lord propounded to Nicodemus, a poor pupil indeed, although a master in Israel, the teacher in Israel, he was a very poor learner.<a name=250:11></a> It is hard to say much about such a man, but he was a long time, you know, coming to the truth.<a name=250:12></a> He and Joseph of Arimathaea came together.<a name=250:13></a> I would say that Joseph would have the lead, I

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=285:1></a> The writer of this epistle speaks of much that was intended to encourage the Hebrew Christians of the time in which it was written, and it is thought that this section will furnish much to show how those Christians were taken account of and provided for, pointing out to them what they had come to; not in the sense of their being carried, as Jehovah said earlier, that He had borne them on eagles' wings and brought them to Himself, but in the sense of coming to the things in their minds and in their affections.<a name=285:2></a> Perhaps but few in that day would understand the things mentioned, but they are spoken of abstractly, as indeed much truth has to be spoken of today.<a name=285:3></a> Things are spoken of abstractly, but nevertheless they exist, and they are enumerated briefly in the verses read, spoken of as over against what Israel came to in the wilderness of Sinai.<a name=285:4></a> "Ye have come", it says (verse 22), "to mount Zion; and to the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem; and to myriads of angels, the universal gathering; and to the assembly of the firstborn who are registered in heaven; and to God, judge of all; and to the spirits of just men made perfect; and to Jesus, mediator of a new covenant; and to the blood of sprinkling, speaking better than Abel".<a name=285:5></a> The mind may enquire why the next verse should be found immediately, "See that ye refuse not him that speaks.<a name=285:6></a> For if those did not escape who had refused him who uttered the oracles on earth, much more we who turn away from him who does so from heaven: whose voice then shook the earth; but now he has promised, saying, Yet once will <i>I</i> shake not only the earth, but also the heaven.<a name=285:7></a> But this Yet once, signifies the

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=287:13></a> Just so; there is something in that, but mount Zion is taken by itself.<a name=287:14></a> The punctuation would show that mount Zion is the first item, and then the second item is the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem; the third item is myriads of angels, the universal gathering, and then following on that the assembly of the firstborn, who are registered in heaven; and then God; and then the spirits of just men made perfect; and then Jesus, and the blood of sprinkling.<a name=287:15></a> I think what is alluded to here refers to Christianity.<a name=287:16></a> The language is somewhat Jewish, really, yet the terms refer now to Christianity, but in view of the millennium it will have its place, too, according to what it used to be in great measure, but in Christianity all has its own setting, the terms have to be understood in the light of Christianity.<a name=287:17></a> We are dealing with Christianity, and Paul, the writer, is speaking to those whom he has addressed as Christians; he is endeavouring to bring them in their spirits and minds into Christianity, to deliver them from Judaism.<a name=287:18></a> But the book of Revelation shows that it will come up again; we read of the Lamb, and a hundred and forty-four

		J.T.<a name=288:12></a> I think abstractly that is the idea, and that is the force of the abstract, in using terms that are not really understood or laid hold of, and yet have application, as, for instance, in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5">1 Corinthians  5</a>, "Purge out the old leaven", it says, "according as ye are unleavened", that is, abstractly we are unleavened as being Christians and having the Holy Spirit.<a name=288:13></a> It is a question of understanding what in itself may be abstract and what application it may have to us.<a name=288:14></a>

		S.McC.<a name=289:8></a> You seem to be guarding the bringing in of the Old Testament setting and the setting in the Apocalypse.<a name=289:9></a> Have you in mind that in Christianity there is a distinctive setting?<a name=289:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=289:11></a> Yes, what I would call Pauline.<a name=289:12></a> Although Paul was writing this epistle undoubtedly, he is aiming at bringing Jewish Christians into Christianity fully.<a name=289:13></a> He had to do with it, because it was through him and Barnabas that the thought was brought in.<a name=289:14></a> The disciples were first called Christians at Antioch.<a name=289:15></a> Paul had to do with that; he and Barnabas had been labouring at Antioch for a year, so that Christianity had become a real thing; it was not something simply that had come out of Judaism, but it had its own entity, its own character, and that is the position of it today.<a name=289:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		L.P.<a name=289:17></a>M.<a name=289:18></a> Is that why the two references to what is heavenly enter into this?<a name=289:19></a> The heavenly note makes it distinctive, it is "heavenly Jerusalem" and those "who are registered in heaven", heaven having a peculiar part in the matter.<a name=289:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=289:21></a> I suppose it is the highest elevation you can get, short of an uncreated condition.<a name=289:22></a> The Son of God Himself enters into an uncreated condition; He goes beyond all the heavens; we cannot measure that at all, and to make that simply heaven will not do, either; it is too much for that.<a name=289:23></a> So that the word 'heavenly' here refers to what in itself is Christian.<a name=289:24></a> The Galatian epistle says Jerusalem above is our mother, but she is said to be "above" there, not 'heavenly', although it is the same Jerusalem, but

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=290:2></a> Does Mount Sinai refer to a demand made upon the people which they could not fulfil, but now God has reached this point in Zion which is the place of His own sovereign choice and provision, and we have come to that?<a name=290:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=290:4></a> Quite so; if you keep in your mind that you are talking about Christianity, and the Spirit of God here, because Paul is aiming at that, only he is gradually coming to it, presently he will be writing the epistle to the Ephesians.<a name=290:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=290:8></a> Just so; it has a heavenly character.<a name=290:9></a> It had an earthly character with them, that is, Jewish believers of old; it was on earth, but now the idea has been transferred to heaven, and presently we will have an epistle to the Ephesians, in its full sense, "blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ".<a name=290:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=290:14></a> It is, I think, somewhat like the epistle to the Colossians.<a name=290:15></a> What He effects is in mind; that is to say, the writer here is endeavouring to lead the Jewish believers into spiritual tangibleness instead of earthly tangibleness, to understand what mount Zion meant, and other such things that they were accustomed to, to lead them into the thing spiritually, using the same names but presently he may use some other names, if needed.<a name=290:16></a>

		J.T.<a name=291:3></a> I would think so.<a name=291:4></a> As much as to say, if Peter or John were present when this epistle was read, someone would say, 'Well, what does he mean by these terms?<a name=291:5></a>' Peter and John could tell them; they would undoubtedly allude to Pentecost, and what followed subsequently in the Acts.<a name=291:6></a> Peter himself alludes to certain things that Paul had said that were hard to be understood; but he did not say that of himself, he could explain, I am sure, any of Paul's letters himself, and we have got to come to Paul, that is the idea.<a name=291:7></a> Peter would convey that to the hearers, you have got to come to Paul.<a name=291:8></a> His letters are Scripture, he would say, you have to come to it.<a name=291:9></a> Of course, Peter's letters are Scripture, too, but they were more Jewish, they were for the circumcision.<a name=291:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=291:21></a> I think it would be vital, more clearly so as soon as we come to see what the administrations were that Paul had under him.<a name=291:22></a> Peter had his own, too; he had an administration, the keys of the kingdom of the heavens were given to him.<a name=291:23></a> I would just remark on one or two things that are clear in Colossians.<a name=291:24></a> Paul, writing to the Colossians, says, in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:23">Colossians  1:23</a>, "and not moved away from the hope of the glad tidings, which ye have heard, which have been proclaimed in the whole creation which is under heaven, of which <i>I</i> Paul became minister".<a name=291:25></a> That is one administrative sphere under him.<a name=291:26></a> Then he goes on, "Now, I rejoice in sufferings for you, and I fill

		up that which is behind of the tribulations of Christ in my flesh, for his body, which is the assembly; of which <i>I</i> became minister", that is another, "according to the dispensation of God which is given me towards you to complete the word of God", that is another thing.<a name=292:1></a> That great matter is under his hand, and if we read it all, the thing will become clearer, "the mystery which has been hidden from ages and from generations, but has now been made manifest to his saints; to whom God would make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations, which is Christ in you the hope of glory"; that is another thing, "Christ in you the hope of glory: whom <i>we</i> announce, admonishing every man, and teaching every man, in all wisdom, to the end that we may present every man perfect in Christ.<a name=292:2></a> Whereunto also I toil, combating according to his working, which works in me in power".<a name=292:3></a> Well, if Peter were to be asked about these headings in our chapter, from Paul's letter, undoubtedly he would unfold something of the things that were under Paul's hand, his special administrative area or areas, so that the Jewish Christians should come into Christianity, and Peter probably might say to them, Why do you not come right over, all the way, into Christianity, because Paul, Barnabas and I had to do with it?<a name=292:4></a> Paul would say, Barnabas and I had to do with it, and after our ministry in Antioch the believers were first called Christians.<a name=292:5></a> The word 'called' there has a significance beyond the ordinary word, meaning it is a word that is to stand in all time, in view of the dispensation proceeding.<a name=292:6></a>

		J.T.<a name=300:15></a> Hence the millennium, I suppose, will be on that principle and then a new heaven and a new earth after that.<a name=300:16></a> The prophets show that the principle of the new heavens and the new earth is in the millennium, but strictly the thing itself is beyond that, wherein righteousness dwells.<a name=300:17></a> But the millennium is a wide area, it is to show what God can do with man in flesh just as he is, but with the added thought of redemption, that is to say, of the new birth.<a name=300:18></a> The new birth in its millennial signification is to bring out what God can do with persons in flesh and blood, that is what the millennium will be, and then there will be evidently a winding up so that we come to a new heavens and a new earth; the state of things that is according to God where all things are of God.<a name=300:19></a>

		The link in the scriptures read is in "the way of more surpassing excellence", and it is the way of love.<a name=304:1></a> It has the corresponding effect, that is, of love, in the person of whom I read in Acts, the evangelist Philip (though he is not called that here).<a name=304:2></a> So that what I shall be speaking of will touch on evangelisation; indeed it is the only touch, for what is in mind is that the spirit of evangelisation is love, and that Philip had love, as the sequel shows.<a name=304:3></a> It had already become evident that he had it, otherwise he would hardly have been given the work of a deacon, for without this spirit of love it would be difficult for a deacon to serve, for it involves the poor, and Paul speaks of not forgetting the poor, and I am sure that was true of him in all his services.<a name=304:4></a> This matter of love and serving the poor comes into the matter of the collection for the saints, that is, they are dignified ones, even if poor; and so it was he spoke of a collection, a special collection, and Philip would not be behind in that, and so he developed into an evangelist, he is <i>called</i> that in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#21:8">Acts  21:8</a>.<a name=304:5></a> As I said, he had love, and the best evidence of it is that he became a deacon.<a name=304:6></a> Christianity at the outset became a community, anyone doubting this had better read <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:42">Acts  2:42</a> - 47.<a name=304:7></a> It is said there that they "had all things common", and later, in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#4:32">Acts  4:32</a>, that "not one said that anything of what he possessed was his own, but all things were common to them"; they were unselfish, and the unselfishness of love as seen in Christianity was seen in them.<a name=304:8></a> They had love, and it was seen in Jerusalem at Pentecost, and in the days that followed; they had no banking account, I need hardly say!<a name=304:9></a> For the

		matter actually was in the hands of the apostles; it was a communal affair, not a one-man affair; it was recognised by Paul, by God Himself and by Christ, indeed by the blessed Trinity.<a name=305:1></a> The work grew, I want to stress that, and the basis of Christianity is the Spirit of God; for when the Lord went up He received from the Father the Spirit of truth, and He indwelt the saints; "they were all together in one place", and the Spirit came down in the form of "parted tongues, as of fire, and it sat upon each one of them" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:1">Acts  2:1</a> - 3), that is the one hundred and twenty, "the crowd of names", each one remaining identifiable, and then they were all filled with the Holy Spirit.<a name=305:2></a> There was no rivalry, and when things arose, such as the matter of appointments, or the matter of the poor, they were settled.<a name=305:3></a> The apostles said in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#6:2">Acts  6:2</a>, "It is not right that we, leaving the word of God, should serve tables", that is things were properly named.<a name=305:4></a> Seven deacons were appointed; it was a communal matter, yet a selective one also; the principle of selection was there, showing how the community developed, and they appointed seven, not twelve, showing that there was a variety of thoughts in the community; the thought of seven, of seven men, chosen to serve the tables; they were called deacons; it was the lowest official you could find in the community.<a name=305:5></a> The development of the community is in mind; the idea of the body of Christ had not yet been introduced, but the assembly was there -- though it is doubtful whether it is really there <i>in word</i> in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:47">Acts  2:47</a>.<a name=305:6></a> The word 'together' describes them, and so it is in this town; it is different, it is true, but they move inwardly together; that is the moving principle all the time.<a name=305:7></a> Peter and John, especially Peter, were the very cream of what was there; so we can call these two chapters, 'Peter and John chapters'.<a name=305:8></a> They were there in affection, though in a sense they were there officially.<a name=305:9></a>

		J.T.<a name=323:1></a> Our inquiry at this time, it will be seen, will relate in the main to two sisters.<a name=323:2></a> Already it has been remarked that the word 'man' as presented in Scripture covers both man and woman.<a name=323:3></a> What we have said about sisters, especially those who are mothers, will largely afford the background of what should be before us, hence both Mary and Elizabeth come into view, particularly Mary.<a name=323:4></a> We read of the angel's conversation with her and her holy submission and faith, for the word is, "blessed is she that has believed".<a name=323:5></a> So that sisters are in view in what may come before us, and they are clearly believing sisters, exhibiting not only the maternal side but the intelligent side of priesthood; Mary shines in this.<a name=323:6></a> The question often arises as to why sisters have so little part verbally in the service of God, but it is clear that in earlier days women had much part in the service of God, including prophecy.<a name=323:7></a> We read of four young women, daughters of Philip, who have a great place in that sense because it is said they prophesied, not simply that they were prophetesses but they actually served in prophecy; so what should come before us now ought to include the prophetic side of service in sisters.<a name=323:8></a> But the maternal side is also in view because the Spirit of God is pleased to furnish us with these wonderful scriptures that have been read, the sisters in mind being affected maternally.<a name=323:9></a> It is most affecting, sobering, and hallowing that the Spirit of God should say so much to us about such women, especially Mary, who has the chief place in this sense, being the Lord's own mother.<a name=323:10></a> This fact, of course, enters into what comes earlier in the chapter as to what preceded the incarnation and what holy and
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		affecting facts are recorded, facts that require in us all, especially sisters, a priestly state and holiness of mind for otherwise we are not capable of dealing with the matter at all.<a name=324:1></a> Both Mary and Elizabeth rise to great spiritual eminence on these lines.<a name=324:2></a> The wonderment is why there should be so much said on the maternal side in the facts recorded.<a name=324:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=324:4></a> Is it not a lovely suggestion that the sisters are not to be excluded from this idea of bondmanship?<a name=324:5></a> We have Mary taking that place, one in which love and affection have a great place.<a name=324:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=324:7></a> Yes, verse 38 says, "Mary said, Behold the bondmaid of the Lord; be it to me according to thy word".<a name=324:8></a> Then the angel departed from her, as if she could be left in her maternal and womanly glory.<a name=324:9></a> She hears much from the angel Gabriel, but he leaves her.<a name=324:10></a> So that we can see how the design of the Spirit is to affect us in the very verbal construction of the text of the scriptures relating to this matter.<a name=324:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=324:12></a> I wondered whether the matter of bondmaidship became in her the spring which put her in right relationship to another sister.<a name=324:13></a> Mary rose up as though there were an inner spring there in the acceptance of bondmaidship.<a name=324:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=324:15></a> Rising up alludes to movement, bringing together those two women, but it was in elevated territory, the hill country.<a name=324:16></a> She went into the hill country with haste showing the urgency of the matter in her mind; there was nothing dilatory about her for it involved travelling some distance and that into an elevated region.<a name=324:17></a> Indeed the territory involved affords the suggestion of elevation whereas ordinary conversation among men and women on the subject involved would lead somewhat downward.<a name=324:18></a> So much is made of birth and family and the like, ordinarily tending to lead us downward to the level of men and human circumstances, whereas the facts here contemplate elevation which is not simply

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=325:6></a> Well, it is remarkable how the male side, the paternal side, is left out or minimised in the facts, the matter being left largely in the scriptures read to two women and they in maternal relations.<a name=325:7></a> I am sure it must be for all of us, especially our sisters, to accustom ourselves to holy conversation.<a name=325:8></a> As it is said, "What ought ye to be in holy conversation and godliness .<a name=325:9></a>.<a name=325:10></a>.<a name=325:11></a> ?<a name=325:12></a>" So that in dealing with these matters we are not dragged down to the level of mere nature but led up, for she rose up and went into the hill country to Elizabeth.<a name=325:13></a> She was related to her after the flesh but the level of their conversation was much above that, it was on a heavenly line, the elevated line of the hill country.<a name=325:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=325:19></a> Just so; there is entire submission, in contrast to Zacharias.<a name=325:20></a> And it is "according to thy word", not simply 'according to thy commandment'.<a name=325:21></a> The use of the phrase "thy word" conveys a suggestion of the divine mind, what is in God's mind that may be conveyed.<a name=325:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=325:27></a> Quite so, it is right there should be that inquiry, and not simply obedience.<a name=325:28></a> It is like obedience, but it is intelligent inquiry, implying that the incarnation of Christ is entirely beyond mere nature.<a name=325:29></a> It is supernatural, that is to say it is a divine transaction, and Mary has an intelligent part in it.<a name=325:30></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=326:6></a> Yes, we are coming on to that because there is a great relation between them; indeed the suggestion comes up as to whether persons who have part in the things of God may not imitate each other, and do, even to the use of words, because there is remarkable similarity in Mary's contribution here to the service of God and Hannah's.<a name=326:7></a> Indeed their circumstances are somewhat alike, and so Mary's word is, "My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit has rejoiced in God my Saviour".<a name=326:8></a> That is to say, she distinguishes between soul and spirit.<a name=326:9></a> The Spirit of God does so in Hebrews, showing how the inwards of the worshipper are brought into evidence.<a name=326:10></a> We often speak of calling on all that is within us to worship, but the inwards are brought into evidence here peculiarly in what Mary says.<a name=326:11></a>

		J.T.<a name=326:15></a> It is very noteworthy and it may be we do not follow enough the way of those who wrote Scripture.<a name=326:16></a> We are to follow things up, and so the Lord in directing John how to write the book of Revelation gives the order in which it is to be written, involving the wording of it.<a name=326:17></a> So that we are to be careful about words, actual phraseology divinely used, and to see that we imitate it.<a name=326:18></a>

		J.T.<a name=329:4></a> It says, "Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit, and cried out with a loud voice".<a name=329:5></a> The phrase, "Mary said", indicates sobriety and balance, but the cry is also to be noted.<a name=329:6></a> The Lord Himself uses it, and it points to the effect of light on the soul that causes wonderment.<a name=329:7></a> In fact, it is a remarkable thing that the chief servant of Abraham who sought a bride for Isaac wondered at her at one point as if the idea of wonderment is right, intelligible, and holy too, in the things of God.<a name=329:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=329:13></a> That is the thought to have in mind, especially now that we are speaking of sisters and how the priestly side should not be left to the brothers, because the divine record shows that sisters in the early days were characteristically priestly and even prophetic.<a name=329:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=330:7></a> I think there is in this sense that she is attributing mightiness to God.<a name=330:8></a> Gabriel's name would signify mightiness because the word 'El' is part of the name.<a name=330:9></a> The word 'El' applied to God means power, and I think Mary is advancing in herself in that she is not now occupied with Gabriel, although she heard his message of instruction, but she is occupied with God.<a name=330:10></a> She speaks of what God did to her, alluding to the wonderful power that operated in the incarnation.<a name=330:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=340:6></a> I think that is good and it brings out the necessity for priesthood in our service on the first day of the week.<a name=340:7></a> All outside is unholy, and there is a power in the Spirit to keep out all that is unsuitable to the service as we are gathered together.<a name=340:8></a>

		A.E.<a name=340:9></a>H.<a name=340:10></a> The Lord is seen going into the wilderness led by the Spirit, and these suggestions are made to Him by the devil; though He, of course, is intrinsically holy and I wondered if there was a pattern for us in it.<a name=340:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=340:12></a> I am sure that is so.<a name=340:13></a> We have part in service and part in sonship and the power of priesthood enables us to maintain that.<a name=340:14></a> So Paul says, "For <i>we</i> are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God, and boast in Christ Jesus, and do not trust in flesh".<a name=340:15></a> That is what marks real Christians.<a name=340:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=341:1></a> There is another feature needed to be brought forward in order to understand the facts relative to the imperfect time, that is the time of law, leading up to the perfect time which is sonship in Christ and the assembly; and so it is thought that we should read about Simeon and Anna as important in the service in the time of law, but very near to the time of perfection.<a name=341:2></a> We cannot stress too much the idea of what is perfect, absolutely conforming to God and His will and pleasure, in contrast to that which, although in measure pleasing God and being of Him, is imperfect.<a name=341:3></a> There can be no doubt that many nominal believers are in the imperfect class, some of them not possessing the Holy Spirit, and hence they are uncertain and indefinite in their outlook and movements, and not of the assembly actually although subjects in measure of God's work.<a name=341:4></a> So that what is to be stressed in that regard is perfection, involving the incarnation and the work of Christ in redemption, the ascension and the gift of the Spirit -- these are the great facts of perfection, the great facts of the present dispensation.<a name=341:5></a> And so in view of all this it is thought that we should look at this scripture in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2">Luke  2</a>as leading up to and almost at the conclusion of the imperfect time; indeed, arriving at Him who is perfect, Christ, of whom it says in Hebrews, "God .<a name=341:6></a>.<a name=341:7></a>.<a name=341:8></a> at the end of these days has spoken to us in the person of the Son".<a name=341:9></a> That is, the perfect Speaker, God Himself, is speaking, so we have arrived at the time of perfect speaking.<a name=341:10></a> Things are disclosed; the Son being the final Speaker, the final word is with Him.<a name=341:11></a> It is thought, too, that Simeon

		and Anna may be taken to represent the closing moments of the imperfect time, the time of law, and to introduce (inclusive of John the baptist) the time of perfection, the time of Christ.<a name=342:1></a> They arrive at the forty-two generations marked as reaching Christ, as seen in Matthew, they were "unto the Christ".<a name=342:2></a> Of Simeon it is said, "there was a man in Jerusalem".<a name=342:3></a> That is to be noted, the person and where he is; it says, "whose name was Simeon; and this man was just and pious, awaiting the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him".<a name=342:4></a> It was not the time of the Spirit but this fact marks what we have been saying, showing how God intervenes in time to bring in what is always perfect.<a name=342:5></a> The period alluded to is just before the perfect time had arrived, the time of sonship, and so it is said that "it was divinely communicated to him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death before he should see the Lord's Christ.<a name=342:6></a> And he came in the Spirit into the temple; and as the parents brought in the child Jesus that they might do for him according to the custom of the law, he received him into his arms, and blessed God, and said, Lord, now thou lettest thy bondman go, according to thy word, in peace; for mine eyes have seen thy salvation".<a name=342:7></a>

		J.T.<a name=342:10></a> That is what I was thinking, and how we may compare with this the nearness of the coming dispensation, because we are very near to it.<a name=342:11></a> But we are in the greatest dispensation now and when it changes there will be a drop publicly in the level of God's doings and ways; whereas now we are on the very top, as it were, at the very summit of things in which God is operating.<a name=342:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=343:3></a> Well, in measure.<a name=343:4></a> Certainly Simeon is very near it because he is an example for us almost at any time, he dwelt in Jerusalem.<a name=343:5></a> It is not simply that he dwelt but that he was <i>in Jerusalem</i>; "and this man was just and pious, awaiting the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him".<a name=343:6></a> He had communications from the Spirit so he was almost up to the time of perfection, the time of Christ.<a name=343:7></a> Similarly we see in John's writings, where John the baptist is speaking in chapter 3, that it is difficult to distinguish his words from the actual wording of the apostle himself, showing that John the baptist was very near Christianity.<a name=343:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=344:4></a> Well, the Spirit of God uses that word of him, not calling him a certain man holding an office, like Zacharias or John the baptist, but just a man, and it is indicated that he was in communion with God.<a name=344:5></a>

		J.T.<a name=345:6></a> Quite so, and what a beautiful indication of affection, taking the Child into his arms and saying things about Him!<a name=345:7></a> He might have left Him in His mother's arms; the magi did not take Him into their arms.<a name=345:8></a> I think it is a distinct mark of spirituality and affection, almost reaching on to our own times, that is to say, to the time of the Spirit.<a name=345:9></a> So "he came in the Spirit into the temple; and as the parents brought in the child Jesus that they might do for him according to the custom of the law, <i>he</i> received him into his arms".<a name=345:10></a> I doubt whether there is anything to equal this in Old Testament times because it concerns no less a Person than the Messiah Himself, the Christ.<a name=345:11></a> We have indications of the place that Jedidiah, or Solomon, had with Jehovah, but no child had such an affectionate reception as Jesus here.<a name=345:12></a>

		J.T.<a name=350:8></a> I would think so.<a name=350:9></a> I think that would be quite in order, although there are modifications in a sense.<a name=350:10></a> The apostle says, I have a desire to depart to be with Christ; but at the same time he speaks of "all who love his appearing".<a name=350:11></a> That is to say, we ought to make more of the appearing than of His actual coming for us, because it is at the time of His appearing that He enters into all His rights and all the purpose of God concerning Him.<a name=350:12></a> Therefore it seems to me that the saints should be concerned about these actual facts that are mentioned, that Simeon is up-to-date, up to the very minute at that time in waiting for the Lord's Christ and not being ready to depart through death till he had seen Him.<a name=350:13></a> We, on the other hand, can speak of the Lord's coming, but in general what we are speaking of and what we should speak of is His appearing.<a name=350:14></a> It is a thing to be loved.<a name=350:15></a> I do not think the rapture is spoken of just in that way, it relates to those who love the Lord and His coming for us.<a name=350:16></a> But it is loving His appearing that is to be in our minds because so much enters into it for Christ, involving what He is looking for and thinking of.<a name=350:17></a>

		J.T.<a name=361:1></a> <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#3">Luke  3</a>leads us to Christ baptised, and it is said He was praying as He was baptised: ".<a name=361:2></a>.<a name=361:3></a>.<a name=361:4></a> and Jesus having been baptised and praying, .<a name=361:5></a>.<a name=361:6></a>.<a name=361:7></a> the heaven was opened, and the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form as a dove upon him; and a voice came out of heaven, <i>Thou</i> art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight" (verses 21, 22).<a name=361:8></a> These two verses bring us to the Lord in full manhood, for verse 23 says, "And Jesus himself was beginning to be about thirty years old", and that is full levitical manhood, for it was at that age that the Levites entered on their full service.<a name=361:9></a> They began earlier as a sort of novitiate service, but "about thirty years" calls attention to the full levitical age; and so in view of divine service we have full manhood indicated involving physical strength.<a name=361:10></a> But when we come to chapter 4 it is said, "But Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan, and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness forty days, tempted of the devil".<a name=361:11></a> So that we have full manhood in Christ in chapter 3, and in chapter 4 He is active in it, returning as it is said from the Jordan where He was baptised and "led by the Spirit in the wilderness", not 'into' it but "in" it; that is, the wilderness position is accepted and He is moving in it, and being led in it.<a name=361:12></a>

		All these are important thoughts for us, especially for the young brothers and sisters who would enter on the service of God.<a name=361:13></a> The service of the Levites was an onerous sort of thing involving physical strain, pre-figuring, of course, spiritual strain and energy; and so it is thought we should look at chapter 4 in the light of what has been said, as showing the Lord in active service in full manhood.<a name=361:14></a> All that divine

		J.T.<a name=378:1></a> It is thought we should complete our inquiry in Luke by looking at chapter 11; not that there are not many other chapters and passages that speak of priesthood, but chapter 11 does so in a special way.<a name=378:2></a> The Lord is there seen as an example for us in prayer because it is said that He was praying in a certain place and that one of His disciples asked Him to teach them to pray.<a name=378:3></a> What is in mind is to show that the Lord not only accedes to the desire of the disciple that He should teach them to pray, but He also gives extended instruction covering the matter, showing the importance of prayer, and of urgent prayer, and how it reaches up to the great fact that the Father is alluded to as giving the Holy Spirit in answer to prayer: "how much rather shall the Father who is of heaven give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?<a name=378:4></a>" And then in the next paragraph we have the Lord dealing with the enemies that are working to hinder us in prayer.<a name=378:5></a> It is said, "And he was casting out a demon, and it was dumb", and then, it says, "the demon being gone out, the dumb man spoke.<a name=378:6></a> And the crowds wondered".<a name=378:7></a> So that the Lord in answering this brother's request, enlarges on the subject of prayer, and how effective it is, and how extensive it is, especially how extensive is the effect of it; and then that the enemy's attack as affecting a man's speech so that he could not pray is overcome, too.<a name=378:8></a> It is to be noted that the disciple did not ask the Lord to teach <i>him</i> to pray, he said, "Lord, teach <i>us</i>", meaning that we should not in any way be selfish in our prayers.<a name=378:9></a> In asking for what may be needed we include all the saints, we should extend to all.<a name=378:10></a> "Teach us to pray".<a name=378:11></a>

		J.T.<a name=380:10></a> I think that if you did pray about your own affairs and were praying in the Spirit He would not be content with that, He would lead you to pray about the interests of the Lord, to pray in a collective sense.<a name=380:11></a> It is a question of how our minds are formed and conditioned and made useful; and if they are occupied in prayer in that way, if they are available to us and if we are available to the Spirit, then we shall be enlarged in our scope.<a name=380:12></a>

		suggestion is that the bullock is for the house of the Lord's people as His house, so to speak, and for that there is no scape-bullock, but instead of that there is the Holy Spirit.<a name=381:1></a> And the Spirit is the answer to prayer really, as we get in this chapter, "how much rather shall the Father who is of heaven give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?<a name=381:2></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.F.<a name=381:3></a>K.<a name=381:4></a> It needs faith for prayer; the assembly in the Acts was praying without faith for Peter's release.<a name=381:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=381:6></a> Just so; they were praying without faith, but still the Lord answered them.<a name=381:7></a> Only we are to pray in faith, and that is what the Lord would teach us this afternoon, because this section of the chapter with all its instruction about prayer and what can be had from prayer involves faith.<a name=381:8></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=381:13></a> In Mary's case, just as with the disciple in mind here, she is not concerned about herself alone.<a name=381:14></a> In chapter 9 the Lord was seen on the holy mount and certain things happened; the Father's voice was heard there and the One who was there was His beloved Son, and He was to be heard, for the Father said, "hear him".<a name=381:15></a> So Mary, not Martha, is sitting at the Lord's feet and hearing His word, because that was the order of the day.<a name=381:16></a> What happened on the mount was light for the moment and the person who profited by the light of the mount of Transfiguration was Mary; she was down below but she learned, she came into the order of the day, so to speak.<a name=381:17></a> The light that the mount of Transfiguration implied was that it was the moment for Christ to be heard; they were to listen to Him, to hear Him, and that was what Mary was doing.<a name=381:18></a> Hence if we put Mary with this disciple we can see that she is affected by
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=382>[Page 382]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the light that governed the moment, that Christ was the One to be listened to, not only in His prayer but in His ministry.<a name=382:1></a> If you hear any ministry, hear what <i>He</i> says; that idea would cover the whole position on the earth at that moment, and does still.<a name=382:2></a> Then what the disciple asked for here was that the Lord should teach them to pray and that is another principle, because it is in the plural conveying that the Lord is ready to teach all the saints to pray and we are to learn how to do it.<a name=382:3></a> We are to realise that the Lord is not only ministering the truth generally but that it is necessary for each of us, especially the young, to hear Him; to leave out all others to hear Him.<a name=382:4></a>

		J.T.<a name=382:18></a> I suppose it is as in other cases that in everything He must have pre-eminence, and especially in a service in which others have part.<a name=382:19></a> He must have His own platform and be by Himself in our minds, as in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#45">Psalm  45</a>, "anointed .<a name=382:20></a>.<a name=382:21></a>.<a name=382:22></a> with the oil of gladness above thy companions".<a name=382:23></a> It would enter in here for He is above us personally.<a name=382:24></a> The mystery of His Person enters into it and we recognise that there is something there that we do not have part in at all; that is, we have to leave Him to Himself and listen to what is said and how He prays, His wording; and then, too, what He says in ministry according to chapter 9.<a name=382:25></a> Mary is an example of one who does this.<a name=382:26></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=383:9></a> Fasting is important because it is self-denial.<a name=383:10></a> It shows how the position of prayer can be supplemented by fasting; not that we always need to add that thought, but it is to be found in the early examples that the praying and fasting went together.<a name=383:11></a> It is self-denial in depriving ourselves of what would hinder, whatever that might be.<a name=383:12></a> We have to learn what it might be, and fasting is one way to find out what hinders in prayer in view of relieving ourselves of it so that we may be unaffected and unhampered.<a name=383:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=383:16></a> Yes; so that on the mount Peter did not know how to speak, he did not know what he was saying, that was the difficulty.<a name=383:17></a> He did not have understanding of the Person of the Lord Jesus.<a name=383:18></a> What a Person He is!<a name=383:19></a> Mary understood however, because she sat at His feet and listened to what He was saying.<a name=383:20></a> So the Spirit of God is not content with what Luke is able to tell us about Mary and Martha, He brings the subject over into John and puts Martha before Mary in a way; that is, she went out to meet the Lord and Mary did not, she sat still in the house.<a name=383:21></a> So it would seem as if the Spirit of God is not content with just what Luke gives us about the sisters.<a name=383:22></a> He would bring John in as indicating what a selection of ministers He

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=384:4></a> I do.<a name=384:5></a> But in connection with what I was saying about a brother who might do better, we have a good many brothers now who are able to serve the saints in a general way and we are thankful for it; but the Lord has a variety and knows them all, and the time may come when He will say, This matter needs someone special, and He will make His own selection.<a name=384:6></a> As regards Mary and Martha, Luke had spoken about them but John also had to speak about them; the Lord would have John speak about them, too, because there was more to be said than what Luke had said.<a name=384:7></a> Therefore let us all be ready, and if there is a special matter, let us be ready for it.<a name=384:8></a> John is presented in Scripture as a special man; Peter would have made him ordinary, saying, "What of this man?<a name=384:9></a>" Of course he was one of the twelve, but Peter would make him only just that.<a name=384:10></a> The Lord did not disclose to Peter that He was going to use John for certain matters, that he was a specialist, so to speak, but He says to Peter, "If I will that he abide until I come, what is that to thee" That is to say Peter was interfering unduly and the Lord would say, Do not stretch out your hand to touch another's line of things or to touch his responsibility; his responsibility is with Me.<a name=384:11></a> "If I will that he abide until I come, what is that to thee?<a name=384:12></a> Follow thou me".<a name=384:13></a> And Peter was adjusted.<a name=384:14></a> The point is that we are to be followers of the Lord.<a name=384:15></a> Let the Lord have His specialists, because this matter of Mary and Martha was a special matter, and the Lord wanted more said about them than Luke gives us; and so we find that Martha was not so far behind Mary in result.<a name=384:16></a> The Lord would bring her up to date, that is what the

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=385:14></a> It is, yet it is up to date so far, because the Lord adds a lot to it.<a name=385:15></a> If we consult Matthew we see that it is not up to his presentation; it is more intelligible from the Christian point of view than Matthew, but it is not the full thought for Christianity and it has a Jewish tinge about it.<a name=385:16></a> But the Lord does not leave it at that, and hence He says further, "Who among you shall have a friend, and shall go to him at midnight and say to him", etc.<a name=385:17></a> This is not Jewish because the Lord is now thinking of us; He is thinking of Luke and in Luke's way and giving liberty to us such as Luke affords us.<a name=385:18></a> He brings up this matter in verse 5, "Who among you shall have a friend, and shall go to him at midnight and say to him, Friend, let me have three loaves, since a friend of mine on a journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him; and he within answering should say, Do not disturb me; the door is already shut, and

		J.T.<a name=388:15></a> That is an elevated inquiry and it bears on the whole position of Christianity, as to whether we can distinguish the divine Persons as They speak.<a name=388:16></a> It is not everyone who can, and perhaps no one now would assume that he can tell which Person is speaking to him, which divine Person is addressing him.<a name=388:17></a> I would think the Scriptures furnish indications as to what the divine Persons are likely to speak of.<a name=388:18></a> I should not attempt to give illustrations because the time would fail us, but the Scriptures are of help for us on that point and one illustration is that the Father judges no one.<a name=388:19></a> Therefore if there is something brought to you inwardly as to judgment related to dealing with persons for sin, I would not connect that with the Father but with the Son, because all judgment is given to the Son.<a name=388:20></a> There is such a thing as departmental positions in which divine Persons operate.<a name=388:21></a>
