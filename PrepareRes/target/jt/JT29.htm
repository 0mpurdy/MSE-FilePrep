		J.T.<a name=1:3></a> Luke deals with things from the outset.<a name=1:4></a> I thought it would be well to consider the application of this principle to those who serve.<a name=1:5></a> We have the details here of John the baptist, and of his infancy, and also of our Lord's.<a name=1:6></a> I thought particularly of John, the first of whom it is said he was filled with the Holy Spirit from his infancy.<a name=1:7></a> It is important to have right spiritual instincts.<a name=1:8></a> Instead of what would stimulate the natural, we have the Spirit in the Baptist from the very outset; He would produce right feelings and instincts.<a name=1:9></a> "The child grew and was strengthened in spirit", it says, "and he was in the deserts until the day of his shewing to Israel".<a name=1:10></a> If the principle is brought out as to ministry, on the one hand spiritual instincts are developed from the beginning, and on the other, what is natural is kept in check and worn down by desert experience.<a name=1:11></a> John was not only in one desert, but in deserts; and then the word of God comes to him in the desert.<a name=1:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		D.L.<a name=1:13></a>H.<a name=1:14></a> Do you make any distinction between wilderness and desert?<a name=1:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:16></a> We have the word 'deserts' in the end of the first chapter, and 'wilderness' here in the beginning of the third.<a name=1:17></a> It is the same word in the original.<a name=1:18></a> What had you in mind?<a name=1:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		D.L.<a name=1:20></a>H.<a name=1:21></a> I had heard some attempt to make a difference.<a name=1:22></a> I do not know of any.<a name=1:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:24></a> The suggestion is that the Spirit, being there from the outset, would produce right instincts.<a name=1:25></a> John's was an extraordinary case, pointing to the importance of right instincts underlying service, not only intelligence

		and understanding, but instincts and feelings.<a name=2:1></a> There would be an enormous advantage in the Spirit being there from the beginning of his history, and then, too, there was something further in the desert experience and the kind of garments he wore and the food he ate.<a name=2:2></a> I think it all conforms with divine requirements.<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.F-t.<a name=2:4></a> Is it significant that the <i>word of God</i> comes upon John?<a name=2:5></a> Is it to such that the word of God comes?<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:7></a> It would so appear.<a name=2:8></a> Scripture gives us the setting -- the governmental circumstances.<a name=2:9></a> The word of.<a name=2:10></a> God comes to such an one as this amid these circumstances.<a name=2:11></a> He was not among the governments of the day.<a name=2:12></a> John appears as another development outside of them altogether; in the midst of all these dignitaries, to such an one has the word of God come.<a name=2:13></a> Here was one having a secret history, a history known to God; in the midst of all these political and religious circumstances there was one who was spiritually matured as under divine care.<a name=2:14></a> It is not mere history.<a name=2:15></a> It is to bring out the divine requirements in service.<a name=2:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.L.<a name=2:17></a> Do you get that in Timothy?<a name=2:18></a> He is a typical man of God in those circumstances.<a name=2:19></a> Do his tears suggest instincts suitable?<a name=2:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:21></a> Tears are a sign of deeply wrought feelings.<a name=2:22></a> Timothy came in where he was needed.<a name=2:23></a>

		D.L.<a name=2:24></a>H.<a name=2:25></a> Tears would come in in relation to the ruined state of things.<a name=2:26></a> I do not know that it speaks of John the baptist weeping.<a name=2:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:28></a> With John we have brought out what God requires, and whatever we may think that stands.<a name=2:29></a> There are no short cuts to the service of God.<a name=2:30></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.F-n.<a name=3:5></a> Would the tears begin in private?<a name=3:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:7></a> No doubt.<a name=3:8></a> You would begin to <i>feel</i> things.<a name=3:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		F.F-n.<a name=3:10></a> The prophet says, "My soul shall weep in secret", (<a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#13:17">Jeremiah  13:17</a>).<a name=3:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:12></a> John was marked off before he was born as one who should not drink wine or strong drink; he should be filled with the Holy Spirit from his mother's womb, and he should thus turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God, that is to say, he would be in the spirit and power of Elijah, who would turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, and thus make way for the Lord.<a name=3:13></a> That was the prophecy preceding, but the realisation of all this depended upon training.<a name=3:14></a> He was born into a remarkable household.<a name=3:15></a> His father had just been under serious discipline, and in the naming of the child he shows that he had learned from the discipline, because instead of naming him Zacharias on the natural line, he wrote down that his name was John.<a name=3:16></a> That was an immense thing for John.<a name=3:17></a> The father's discipline under the hand of God (and the mother was in it as well) had John in view, showing how God takes care of His servants.<a name=3:18></a> So Zacharias gives his name John, and then his mouth is opened and he speaks, praising God.<a name=3:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.F-n.<a name=3:20></a> Do you think that was the result of Zacharias' private discipline?<a name=3:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:22></a> I think it was.<a name=3:23></a> He was not unbelieving now; he had been.<a name=3:24></a> Then it says that he prophesied, and his ministry had reference to Christ, not to John, that is to say, in that household Christ is brought in.<a name=3:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		John is brought up in that atmosphere where the father begins to speak, not about him, but about Christ.<a name=4:1></a> God had raised up a horn in the house of David, not in the house of Aaron; but then Zacharias turns to the child and says, "Thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest".<a name=4:2></a> Thus we see the divine preparation in the household for this special vessel.<a name=4:3></a> Then the training was in keeping with all this; it says, "he was in the deserts until the day of his shewing to Israel".<a name=4:4></a> There was no effort in the training to produce anything in him that would appeal to man's flesh.<a name=4:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.F-n.<a name=4:6></a> Are you speaking now of maturity in regard to service as relating to special servants, or for all to take it up?<a name=4:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:8></a> Oh, for all!<a name=4:9></a> You do not want to show your child to the world.<a name=4:10></a> The showing of the child is to Israel, that is to say, the people of God.<a name=4:11></a> The training is in keeping with that.<a name=4:12></a> Training for the world is very different.<a name=4:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.C.<a name=4:14></a> How do the deserts apply today?<a name=4:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:16></a> That would be keeping the children from the things of the world.<a name=4:17></a> You have no other thought for them than that they should be shown to Israel, so to speak, in due course, and if they are to recognise what is spiritual, no worldly training or culture will help, but will hinder.<a name=4:18></a> On account of the way many children are brought up, when they are shown to Israel they are very defective; they need to have the reproach of Egypt rolled away.<a name=4:19></a> John never needed that.<a name=4:20></a> I think Timothy is an example of what can be done.<a name=4:21></a> Timothy's father, being a Greek, would hardly help, but the mother's faith must have been strong.<a name=4:22></a> The emphasis is on the mother and grandmother.<a name=4:23></a> Faith <i>dwelt</i> in them.<a name=4:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.F-n.<a name=4:25></a> Would the father being a Greek furnish an indication of the conditions in which the child was brought up?<a name=4:26></a>

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:1></a> Faith is not said to have been in the father, but in the mother and grandmother.<a name=5:2></a> The preponderating influence was evidently with the mother.<a name=5:3></a> Both Zacharias and Elisabeth were believers, and they were greatly helped by discipline.<a name=5:4></a> The best kind of faith, the most enduring, is brought out of the furnace.<a name=5:5></a> Here is a child whose parents' faith had been nourished in discipline.<a name=5:6></a> Zacharias had asked for something but he did not believe he would get it.<a name=5:7></a> God says, I will give it to you anyway, and then I will bring you to it, and that was by discipline.<a name=5:8></a> Then, as we have seen, John was in the deserts until the time of his showing to Israel.<a name=5:9></a> The Lord is brought in in the next chapter; but I thought that first in John we might see how perfect the result was, that in the midst of these dignitaries in the world -- all under the government of God in their places here -- was a man He could take up.<a name=5:10></a> His secret history qualifies him for the word of God to come to him.<a name=5:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then it says, "he came into all the district round the Jordan".<a name=5:12></a> He selects his area of service, all in keeping with his training.<a name=5:13></a> He does not go to the places of religious repute to serve.<a name=5:14></a> He could easily have attracted attention in Jerusalem, but instead of that it was the district of the Jordan, with all the spiritual memories and teaching that centre around that river.<a name=5:15></a> As instructed in the way of the Lord, the minister who should finish up the old dispensation would be learned in the Old Testament.<a name=5:16></a> He would know the significance of Jordan, for the truth centring in Jordan abounds in the Old Testament.<a name=5:17></a> That is the next thing that would come out in a vessel -- he would know "the way of God", compare <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#18:26">Acts  18:26</a>.<a name=5:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.F.<a name=5:19></a> Does the Lord begin at Jordan, too?<a name=5:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:21></a> Quite.<a name=5:22></a> He comes to John there.<a name=5:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.F.<a name=5:24></a> Is that why Jordan (baptism) comes before the genealogy in Luke?<a name=5:25></a> In Matthew it is after.<a name=5:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:27></a> I think so -- to bring out the <i>order of man</i>.<a name=5:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=6>[Page 6]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Matthew it is royalty, but in Luke you get the genealogy identifying the Lord -- that kind of man -- with our race right through Adam to God.<a name=6:1></a> It is to bring out what the Lord was.<a name=6:2></a> After all had been baptised He was baptised; He was the last apparently.<a name=6:3></a> He did not put Himself forward; He claimed no distinction, and as baptised He is <i>praying</i>.<a name=6:4></a> There was full maturity there; the order of man was fully come to light, and heaven owns it; and now He is identified with our race.<a name=6:5></a> Marvellous grace!<a name=6:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.C.<a name=6:7></a> Does He have in view in His service to bring man into accord?<a name=6:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:9></a> That is it.<a name=6:10></a> What you get in John is that he is instructed in the way of the Lord, and his ministry is governed by the light of it.<a name=6:11></a> Isaiah is quoted.<a name=6:12></a> In the next chapter Isaiah is again quoted, or read, by the Lord -- the passage that governs <i>His</i> ministry.<a name=6:13></a> Here we get a passage that governs John's ministry, so evidently we need to be governed by the light governing the position, that is to say, by what the dispensation of God is.<a name=6:14></a> If we are governed by that light, we are acting with God.<a name=6:15></a> Paul emphasises that the Corinthians were not so governed.<a name=6:16></a> Then the next thing is that John sees the people -- the crowds, it says -- coming to him, and he makes no distinction; he calls them a generation of vipers.<a name=6:17></a> That was a very strong word to use in preaching, but the point to see is that he <i>touches their consciences</i>.<a name=6:18></a> He knows what to say.<a name=6:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.F-n.<a name=6:20></a> This was making straight the way of the Lord.<a name=6:21></a> I was thinking that the Lord begins in a very different kind of way.<a name=6:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:23></a> Oh, very different!<a name=6:24></a> It is on the line of grace, but John is on the line of reformation.<a name=6:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.McM.<a name=6:26></a> What does the Jordan stand for?<a name=6:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:28></a> It generally means death; it is a leading subject in the Old Testament, with which John was no doubt conversant, so that he begins there.<a name=6:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=7>[Page 7]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.McM.<a name=7:1></a> Is it death and resurrection -- the two together?<a name=7:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:3></a> Yes.<a name=7:4></a> It stands for death, but death as overthrown by the power of God.<a name=7:5></a> But in using this expression, "offspring of vipers", he makes no difference.<a name=7:6></a> In Matthew he referred to certain ones, but here he touches the consciences of all, so that they begin to ask what they should do.<a name=7:7></a> The ministry was effective.<a name=7:8></a> That is the important thing!<a name=7:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.M.<a name=7:10></a> Would you say that the way the servant gets at consciences marks his own individuality?<a name=7:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:12></a> I think each has his own way of getting at people.<a name=7:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		D.L.<a name=7:14></a>H.<a name=7:15></a> This would be somewhat on the prophetic line, would it not?<a name=7:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:17></a> It would.<a name=7:18></a> One has often noticed in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:11">Acts  2:11</a> that those upon whom the Spirit came were speaking of "the great things of God", but there were no convictions; when Peter spoke a little later there were three thousand converted.<a name=7:19></a> He had his own divinely given way of getting at them and of applying the truth.<a name=7:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.M.<a name=7:21></a> It is always the truth.<a name=7:22></a>

		J.T.<a name=7:33></a> Surely, but I do not know whether we should use the word 'open-air'.<a name=7:34></a> It is preaching, whether indoors or out of doors.<a name=7:35></a> Preach wherever you can.<a name=7:36></a>

		D.L.<a name=8:11></a>H.<a name=8:12></a> John seems to be still on the responsible line, so in answering these questions he points to certain practices which would prove where they were.<a name=8:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=8:14></a> Yes.<a name=8:15></a> It is not christianity, but you have general principles noted.<a name=8:16></a> He is preaching according to the dispensation under which he is working.<a name=8:17></a> It was preparation for the Lord, according to the ministry John had received.<a name=8:18></a> He puts them to the test, that is, the question of equalisation, levelling up and levelling down, making straight ways.<a name=8:19></a> The different classes come to him, the tax-gatherers and the soldiers, and he has a word for all of them.<a name=8:20></a> But we are not reformers; reformation does not belong to this dispensation.<a name=8:21></a>

		from amongst the saints, as if he would honour the saints by quoting their very words to depict for us the varied glories of the Son of God.<a name=15:1></a> And so the Baptist's words are quoted in this gospel for this very reason.<a name=15:2></a> He is quoted at length in the first chapter to show how small his estimate of himself was, and how great his estimate of Jesus.<a name=15:3></a> He is quoted as saying that "he who sent me to baptise with water, he said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, he it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit".<a name=15:4></a> And then he adds from himself, "And I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God", (verses 33,34).<a name=15:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And so the narrative goes on to the end of this chapter, where one says to John that Jesus baptised.<a name=15:6></a> The Baptist answers, "A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven" (verse 27); he sweeps away, as it were, in a sentence the whole fabric of sacerdotal and hierarchical christianity.<a name=15:7></a> It is not from above.<a name=15:8></a> Nothing is of any value in his mind save what is from above, and so, "He who comes from above is above all", (verse 31).<a name=15:9></a> You see how the Holy Spirit uses the words of the Baptist; He reserves him, as it seems to me, for this very purpose, that he might join in the great chorus of loving voices who depict the glory of Jesus.<a name=15:10></a> This is the time for learning to do that, beloved brethren.<a name=15:11></a> This is the time for learning how, as proving the Lord, as loving Him, to speak well of Him.<a name=15:12></a> And so John the baptist is a model for us.<a name=15:13></a> He says, "He must increase, but I must decrease", (verse 30).<a name=15:14></a> He was a friend of the Bridegroom, and he rejoiced to hear the Bridegroom's voice; hearing it he says, "this my joy then is fulfilled", (verse 29).<a name=15:15></a> So that John the baptist does not disappear from the scene in this gospel in the prison, nor in unbelief, nor under a cloud in any way.<a name=15:16></a> He disappears like the setting sun, as its countless beams radiate round the western horizon.<a name=15:17></a> He goes down joyfully, and he

		And so as John's speech finishes the Son of God stands out in His solitary greatness and dignity.<a name=16:7></a> It is said, "The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hands".<a name=16:8></a> However different it may appear at the present time, beloved friends, and however much power is in the hands of others ostensibly -- government, and so on -- all <i>is</i> delivered (not shall be delivered) into His hands.<a name=16:9></a> If He is not exercising it in a public way, it is because He is the perfect Administrator; it is because He would administrate what there is to administer in keeping with the mind of God.<a name=16:10></a> Hence in the next chapter we find Him wearied with His journey, "just as he was", (chapter 4:6) as we are told, sitting on the well.<a name=16:11></a> He is the Son and has all things in His hands; the government is upon His shoulder; all that God has to display publicly is in His hands, but for the moment He could be a lonely traveller through this world.<a name=16:12></a> It was due to God; it was in keeping with the divine way, and so as the solitary, needy soul from the city confronts Him, He administers, He unfolds what He was there for: "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give, me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water", (verse 10).<a name=16:13></a> He was in possession of this priceless treasure.<a name=16:14></a> You see it was given into His hands and He proposes to <i>give</i> it.<a name=16:15></a>

		We have often had it before us, that this book of Revelation gives us the fruits of all the roots of Genesis; and the root of this passage goes back to Jacob.<a name=20:6></a> The number twelve begins at Jacob, I mean in the history of God's ways with men -- whatever there may be in the heavens according to His providence.<a name=20:7></a> It is a family thought.<a name=20:8></a> They were sons of one man, of one father, and from that root the teaching connected with administration in secret is connected.<a name=20:9></a> The enemy sought to break it up, as we see in the history of Joseph, but God carried it through.<a name=20:10></a> It seemed to have been broken up, but as the family thought in Judah shone in respect of his father and in respect of the "little one", (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#44:20">Genesis  44:20</a>) Benjamin, Joseph could no longer restrain himself.<a name=20:11></a> The family thought reappears, and so it is in the history of the church.<a name=20:12></a> However much the enemy has sought to obliterate the family thought, God carries it through.<a name=20:13></a> The whole system around us to which I have referred denies the family thought, whereas it is that thought that underlies all that God is working out.<a name=20:14></a> I hope we cherish it.<a name=20:15></a> He has brought us back to the idea of the family, and, having the family, He has got the means of administration.<a name=20:16></a> In family love we are available to God.<a name=20:17></a> In all that arises of His gracious service we are perfectly flexible, as I said.<a name=20:18></a>

		Now I want to point out how all the features of the twelve reappear.<a name=21:4></a> John goes on to show us the bride, the Lamb's wife, the holy city, Jerusalem.<a name=21:5></a> Her light is most precious, he says, like a jasper, and she has twelve gates.<a name=21:6></a> At the gates are twelve angels, and the names of the twelve tribes of Israel.<a name=21:7></a> The vessel is great enough to include in it all the governmental agencies of God.<a name=21:8></a> Every instrument of His government in the past is understood, and a place is made for it.<a name=21:9></a> Angels have a prominent place with us, and so Israel; and although our inferiors, their very names are cherished.<a name=21:10></a> Love for God will always lead us to value what He has used.<a name=21:11></a> Paul says, "Our whole twelve tribes", (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#26:7">Acts  26:7</a>).<a name=21:12></a> How he loved them!<a name=21:13></a> And James writes to them.<a name=21:14></a> Faith never gives them up, and so they are there.<a name=21:15></a> It is a feature of the greatness, morally, of the city that she includes every agency of divine government.<a name=21:16></a>

		The assembly thinks for God, and of those whom God respects.<a name=21:17></a> The identification of the governmental function of the assembly with that of angels and Israel is most interesting.<a name=21:18></a> The golden links of divine love are seen here.<a name=21:19></a> It is in the number twelve.<a name=21:20></a> And there are twelve foundations.<a name=21:21></a> Now we are coming nearer home.<a name=21:22></a> Who are these?<a name=21:23></a> On them are the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb; it is a question of the Lamb, they belong to Him.<a name=21:24></a> They belong to Jesus who suffered and died for us.<a name=21:25></a> We rejoice in them.<a name=21:26></a> It will be observed in the epistles that the foundation is connected with them; whether the twelve or Paul, the city is built upon the foundation of the apostles.<a name=21:27></a> The thing is given concretely.<a name=21:28></a> The Lord says, I will build, but it is by the apostles

		ASSEMBLY MATERIAL

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I was thinking of the assembly and the material that is requisite for it, all God's operations at the present time having it in view.<a name=23:1></a> Luke has his own way of dealing with this material and so has Matthew; indeed, all the New Testament writers deal with it directly or indirectly.<a name=23:2></a> Matthew makes the material the result of revelation; it was a matter of revelation, and revelation is not a moral process; whereas Luke has the moral process in view, and so he deals with "the word of God".<a name=23:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The word of God is not exactly a revelation, although involved in it; revelation is by a divine Person directly.<a name=23:4></a> We have it with Peter, and we have it with Paul; in Peter's case it was revelation 'to'; that is to say, the Father had revealed to Peter who the Person was that was before him; in Paul's case it was revelation 'in'.<a name=23:5></a> If we go by the record of the same incident in Luke and Mark, we should conclude that Peter's answer to the Lord's query was based on what he <i>saw</i> in Christ, but Matthew refers not to that but to revelation by the Father.<a name=23:6></a> No doubt, when the Lord propounded the question as to who He was, they reverted back in their minds to what they had seen and heard in Him.<a name=23:7></a> Were He to put such a question to us we should revert back to what had come under our notice in Him.<a name=23:8></a> So we may assume that all the disciples, including Peter, were concerned on those lines, but then the Father acted sovereignly in relation to Peter's case.<a name=23:9></a> But each of them would be concerned to answer, for the question was not put to Peter specifically; it was put to them all, "Whom say ye I am?<a name=23:10></a>" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:15">Matthew  16:15</a>).<a name=23:11></a> So that in their exercises (which I
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=24>[Page 24]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		may remark are those which would be wholesome and educative) the Father acts specifically in regard of Peter.<a name=24:1></a> He revealed to him that the Person before him was His Son, the Son of the living God.<a name=24:2></a> That He was the Christ Peter might have arrived at, as I said, otherwise; Nathanael arrived at it otherwise, and according to Luke and Mark doubtless Peter also, but it is quite another thing to have the truth by revelation.<a name=24:3></a> This Matthew presents.<a name=24:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have to distinguish between revelation and declaration.<a name=24:5></a> In taking account of what had come under their notice in the Lord's words and works and ways, they had been occupied with declaration, and that is the sum of what John presents in saying, "the only-begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him".<a name=24:6></a> It was what was public and general.<a name=24:7></a> But in what the Father had revealed to Peter, and in the Lord's comments we learn that the material was the outcome not of the declaration, but of the revelation, that is to say, the material in result is something outside of man's ken; it comes directly from God; it is spiritual.<a name=24:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now all that has to be borne in mind in connection with what I am going to say, and that is, that Luke deals with the word of God and this refers to the mind of God, not only as to who Christ is, but as to the mind of God spoken.<a name=24:9></a> It is a question of what is spoken, and so completely has it been spoken by Christ, that He is called definitely "the Word".<a name=24:10></a> He is called that both by Luke and John; (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:2">Luke  1:2</a>; <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:1">John  1:1</a>).<a name=24:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the word of God, beloved brethren, coming in thus, involves a moral process in us, and I wish to show the bearing of this on assembly material.<a name=24:12></a> Luke in treating of the parable of the sower, regards the seed not as the word of the kingdom, but calls it "the word of God"; (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#8:11">Luke  8:11</a>).<a name=24:13></a> Matthew calls it "the word of the kingdom", (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13:19">Matthew  13:19</a>) and Mark calls it simply "the word", (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#4:14">Mark  4:14</a>,15)
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=25>[Page 25]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		but Luke calls it "the word of God".<a name=25:1></a> Hence it is a question of God's mind and involves a moral process in those who receive it.<a name=25:2></a> They are to be affected by it, it is to change their whole outlook; it is to change their taste and their feelings; in a word it is to produce in them a wholly new moral being, and that being is to be "of God".<a name=25:3></a> They are to be like God in understanding and intelligence.<a name=25:4></a> It is not exactly a question of His attributes, but of His <i>mind</i>.<a name=25:5></a> Think of being let into the mind of God; it is not even His commandments.<a name=25:6></a> Commandments are imperative; we may not understand them, but we have to obey; but the 'word' gives us understanding, so that we know the why and wherefore of things.<a name=25:7></a> Thus Luke in treating of this parable of the sower arrives at the good ground.<a name=25:8></a> In all the evangelists the other ground is valueless; the only ground which is of any value is that which produces fruit that remains, and so Luke goes to the root and says, "an honest and good heart".<a name=25:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now it is well to face this, beloved brethren, especially young people, because God intends you for great things.<a name=25:10></a> He has great things for you, and He intends you to face them, and to have to say to them.<a name=25:11></a> One of the greatest things is that we have to do with Christ, I mean that we are to be Levites and priests.<a name=25:12></a> Luke brings that out in the early part of his gospel; he brings out one person who had to do with Him most intimately; that was Mary.<a name=25:13></a> It was not merely that she was blessed; she had to do with Christ in the most intimate way, and she was prepared for it.<a name=25:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so you get Simeon in the temple; he was to have to do with Christ; I am not speaking now of what he would get through Christ, but I am referring to his having to handle Christ.<a name=25:15></a> The apostle John speaks about handling the Word of life.<a name=25:16></a> What holy hands they must be, what intelligent hands!<a name=25:17></a> And so Simeon stands out as a model for us.<a name=25:18></a> It is said that

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the Holy Spirit was upon him; his early history is not given to us; he appears suddenly as qualified to handle that blessed Babe.<a name=26:1></a> He was to have to do with Him.<a name=26:2></a> What training he must have had with God, what experience with God!<a name=26:3></a> He was a man who was in communion with God; the Holy Spirit was upon him, and it was revealed to him by the Holy Spirit (the most intimate communication, not through an angel but by the Spirit) that he should not see death until he had seen the Lord's Christ.<a name=26:4></a> Subsequently to that he came by the Spirit into the temple, and being in the temple by the Spirit he received the Babe into his arms; he had to do with the Babe; he had to do with Christ.<a name=26:5></a> And as he takes the Babe in his arms he is qualified.<a name=26:6></a> The mind of God comes into his soul; he blessed God; he is a consecrated priest now; his arms are filled with Christ and he says to God, "now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word",.<a name=26:7></a> (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:29">Luke  2:29</a>).<a name=26:8></a> Note what respect he had for the word; he would not wish to leave before the time, "for mine eyes have seen thy salvation", and then he proceeds to unfold the mind of God with regard to the Babe.<a name=26:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I refer to all this that you may see that we are called upon to have to do with Christ.<a name=26:10></a> I am not referring to what you receive from Him as the result of His death, but that we have to do with Him.<a name=26:11></a> How important therefore to be formed by the word of God, that is to say, the whole moral being formed by it, every part of the being.<a name=26:12></a> Hence the word here is that an honest and good heart receiving the word brings forth fruit <i>with patience</i>.<a name=26:13></a> It is not here the quantity of fruit as in Mark and Matthew; in Matthew we have a hundred, sixty and thirty-fold, that is to say, there is decline, but still there is fruit.<a name=26:14></a> In Mark it is the reverse, the hundred comes last but Luke is not concerned with the quantity of fruit, but the <i>kind</i> of fruit, the state of soul in which the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here we are confronted with all sorts of difficulties, "difficult times", as the scripture says (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#3:1">2 Timothy  3:1</a>); they are here now, and patience is required, so that it is a question of the state of soul in which the fruit is borne.<a name=27:2></a> You can understand a farmer looking at his land, at the depth of the soil, at the quality of the soil; you say, 'You will have a fine crop here', but he is looking at the soil; it is a question of the soil.<a name=27:3></a> So Luke is occupied with the soil, not the quantity of fruit, but the kind of soil in which the fruit grows, the precious outcome of the word, in an honest and good heart.<a name=27:4></a> What patience God has had!<a name=27:5></a> The patience of God is one of the greatest of subjects.<a name=27:6></a> Think of God rising up early, as He says in the Old Testament, to send prophets, and that to "a disobedient and gainsaying people", (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#10:21">Romans  10:21</a>).<a name=27:7></a> We have to be like God if we are to represent Him when we have to do with a disobedient and gainsaying people, and we have to bear fruit in these circumstances.<a name=27:8></a> We see this in Noah; he preached; we are told he was a preacher of righteousness.<a name=27:9></a> What patience was required as the fruit was so small -- the results so little!<a name=27:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I pass on to Peter's epistle, because I want to show you how he regards the new birth.<a name=27:11></a> In the epistle to the Hebrews you get something that throws light on the subject as showing how the word operates as received into the soul of the believer -- into "an honest and good heart"; it takes account of the component parts, as I may say, of a believer.<a name=27:12></a> There has to be inward adjustment, not only outward, and so we are told in that epistle that the word of God is living and operative, it is sharper than any two-edged sword, it divides asunder between soul and spirit; it is a question of its inward operation.<a name=27:13></a> There

	<div class="paragraph">
		is nothing in the whole universe like it.<a name=28:1></a> No surgeon, however clever, can attempt to do what the word of God does.<a name=28:2></a> Only God Himself understands man; man is fearfully and wonderfully made; there are inward influences and movements that are beyond the cleverest of men, but they are not beyond the word of God.<a name=28:3></a> The word of God knows how to divide between soul and spirit, but He divides it for me, not for Himself.<a name=28:4></a> In Philippians we read that the saints were to be joined in soul as well as in mind.<a name=28:5></a> We come together and enjoy the word of God and we go home, and our souls are perhaps not much in it, but it may be are in our families.<a name=28:6></a> In the beginning "the heart and soul .<a name=28:7></a>.<a name=28:8></a>.<a name=28:9></a> of those that had believed were one" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#4:32">Acts  4:32</a>); all their goods were in the community.<a name=28:10></a> Now the word of God divides asunder between soul and spirit, joints and marrow, alluding to the body.<a name=28:11></a> There is spirit, soul and body.<a name=28:12></a> The word of God helps me in regard of these, so that there should be adjustment in me, that I may be intelligent as to myself.<a name=28:13></a> You say, 'That may mean introspection', but introspection is good; it is wholesome if it be a question of the word of God, for I know by it the principles that are operating in me and I am adjusted.<a name=28:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The result of all that is that there is a birth, as it says, "being born again".<a name=28:15></a> Now this is not the "born anew" of <a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>.<a name=28:16></a> There are those who reduce the things of God as much as possible; they reduce them down to a minimum so as to avoid exercise, and to avoid study and contemplation, but "a workman that needeth not to be ashamed" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:15">2 Timothy  2:15</a>) must rightly divide the word of truth, and the word of truth enables me to discern a distinction between <a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>and <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1">1 Peter  1</a>.<a name=28:17></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:6">John  3:6</a> there is nothing said about being born by the <i>word</i>.<a name=28:18></a> It is the initial thing, simply born of water and of the Spirit.<a name=28:19></a> The result is not a person, but "<i>that which</i> is born of the Spirit is spirit".<a name=28:20></a> We have to note these things, dear brethren, so as to be

		In saying that I want to link it up with <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2">1 Peter  2</a>and 3.<a name=31:4></a> You observe the exhortation is that they should lay aside "all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envyings and all evil speakings".<a name=31:5></a> Need I comment on this?<a name=31:6></a> How applicable it is to persons who are born again by the word of God.<a name=31:7></a> In the light of that fact you lay aside these things: malice, guile, hypocrisies, envyings, and evil speakings.<a name=31:8></a> These are to be laid aside; they are unfit for people born by the word of God.<a name=31:9></a> And then he says, "as newborn babes".<a name=31:10></a> It is not that they were that, there is no reproach here attached to the word 'babes'; in Corinthians the word is used reproachfully; (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3:1">1 Corinthians  3:1</a>).<a name=31:11></a> Paul does not say <i>newborn</i> babes in Corinthians; Peter does here because he is dealing with taste for milk -- with unaffected, unadulterated taste.<a name=31:12></a> "Newborn babes"; we are to be like that; it is a question of what taste there is for "the pure mental milk of the word".<a name=31:13></a> You may say there is not enough for the young among the saints, not enough literature; we have to go outside to get books.<a name=31:14></a> Beware of that; there is no "pure mental milk" in any of those books that you get outside; you go to feed your mind, but you will feed it with something impure; it is not pure.<a name=31:15></a> We read in <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#2">Proverbs  2</a>verses 12 and 16 of "the man that speaketh froward things" and of "the strange woman, the stranger who flattereth with her words"; the books of this world represent these things to us christians; they are froward; they are against God.<a name=31:16></a>

		Having arrived at that point, it only remains to show the connection with the assembly in Peter's way.<a name=32:9></a> Peter uses the word 'stones', the figure, no doubt, arising from the revelation to himself, and what he was as being a stone; he says, "To whom coming, a living stone".<a name=32:10></a> I hardly know any passage that tests us like this as to whether we are material for the assembly.<a name=32:11></a> To whom are you <i>coming</i>?<a name=32:12></a> To One who is good.<a name=32:13></a> You have tasted it; the word 'taste' refers back to the "newborn babes"; you have tasted that He is good.<a name=32:14></a> Now in coming to Him you recognise that He is rejected of men, cast away as worthless.<a name=32:15></a> Are you prepared for that?<a name=32:16></a> That is the test.<a name=32:17></a> He is held to be of no account at all by men; He was presented to them, they had every opportunity of proving Him; then they cast Him away.<a name=32:18></a> They were building, but they cast Him away as worthless.<a name=32:19></a> That is the One you come to; it is in that connection the passage lies.<a name=32:20></a> The members of the assembly come to

		THE TESTIMONY PASSED ON IN FRESHNESS

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#31:14">Deuteronomy  31:14</a> - 30; <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#32:1">Deuteronomy  32:1</a> - 4,44
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is said in <a href="../bible/Ecclesiastes.htm#1:4">Ecclesiastes  1:4</a> that "One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever".<a name=34:1></a> I have in mind that there is that which is of God on the earth, and that it is to be maintained and passed on from the generation that is passing away to the one coming.<a name=34:2></a> I have selected this passage in Deuteronomy because to my mind it fits in with these thoughts exactly, that is, we have Moses as representing a generation -- one marked by extraordinary events.<a name=34:3></a> Moses may be taken, indeed, as representative of those who are faithful in the maintenance of what God intends to continue, and we see the continuance in freshness in him.<a name=34:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Earlier, we have in Jacob a generation in connection with which also there were extraordinary events.<a name=34:5></a> He, too, passes away in freshness and energy.<a name=34:6></a> He, like Moses, passes on unimpaired to the coming generation what he held and treasured.<a name=34:7></a> You will recall how he strengthened himself upon his bed and conveyed to his sons the mind of God; in a most striking manner he was able to pass on unimpaired what he had maintained and cherished to those who followed.<a name=34:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So in a later day we have David, another great servant, representing a generation in which there were great events in the unfolding of God's mind in testimony.<a name=34:9></a> According to Chronicles he passes away in vigour.<a name=34:10></a> It is true that in 1 Kings he is seen as weak and heatless, needing external warmth to keep him alive; but in 1 Chronicles we have a different David -- as if God would maintain this great principle -- for we read there that he stood up upon his feet.<a name=34:11></a>

		Doubtless he had learned to do that early.<a name=35:1></a> Many of us do not begin thus.<a name=35:2></a> You will all recall how the man in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#3">Acts  3</a>who had been lame from his birth stood up; he had never experienced such a thing, he had never in his life stood up upon his feet.<a name=35:3></a> Peter takes him by his right hand -- for God would use every opportunity, every advantage, to help him -- and in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazaraean bids him rise up and walk, and immediately his feet and ankle <i>bones</i> were made strong.<a name=35:4></a> Without these being made strong he could never have stood on his feet; but as he leaped up, in the consciousness of power in himself which was to be realised in a fuller way later -- in the consciousness of <i>that</i>, he stood on his feet.<a name=35:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would say, beloved young people, that apart from that experience, that is, the power of balance spiritually, you can never hope to be material for the assembly.<a name=35:6></a> Unless that is learned at the outset, that is, how to balance, in other words, the power to stand up, we shall never be material for the assembly, we shall be a public charge; we shall be leaning on others.<a name=35:7></a> We all know how infants need help in learning to stand and walk, but this man at the very outset of his spiritual experience stood.<a name=35:8></a> He was not to lean on others, he was to be an asset among the saints, and so he enters with the apostles into the temple, and he walked and leaped and praised God; and he <i>held</i> Peter and John; he held them, they did not need to hold or support him.<a name=35:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, obviously, in the passage referred to, David had acquired this power and carried it through; he had learned early to stand upon his own feet.<a name=35:10></a> You may be sure that he needed that ability, that balance in his conflict in his youth, when he met the lion and the bear.<a name=35:11></a> He had had, too, to stand up against the rebuffs of his elder brethren in the presence of Goliath's challenge.<a name=35:12></a> One who had not learned to stand upon his feet would have withered under such a rebuke

		Now this is a most remarkable occurrence; it is full of instruction in regard to the epochs making up the history of the dispensation, in regard to the passing of active service and leadership from one set of hands into another.<a name=37:3></a> I wish to call attention to what took place in the tabernacle of the congregation in this connection, a connection that perhaps has not been much observed, but one of immense importance.<a name=37:4></a> As set up and anointed, the tabernacle is the great central figure in the history of God's people.<a name=37:5></a> In the book of Leviticus God <i>calls</i> out of it; this underlies the epistle to the Corinthians; it is a question of <i>calling</i>; the saints are "called saints" -- the divine call issuing forth from that which God has set up here and anointed, and so believers were gathered in.<a name=37:6></a>

		In Numbers it is God <i>speaking in the wilderness</i>, that is to say, it is God taking account of us in our circumstances in a scene of adversity and trial.<a name=37:7></a> Let no one assume that God is at all indifferent to our position in the wilderness; it is Numbers that gives us the different encampments; they were written down by Moses by the commandment of the Lord (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#33:2">Numbers  33:2</a>) to remind every christian that his particular wilderness circumstances are taken account of.<a name=37:8></a> God knows them and He is with you in them normally; so that Numbers is the speaking in the wilderness but out of the tabernacle; the emphasis is on the fact that we are in the wilderness, that God knows it, and that God speaks in it: "The Lord spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai".<a name=37:9></a> Now that is Numbers; and so, in every movement of the people, God is there.<a name=37:10></a> In fact, in chapter 10 in their first movement from one camp to another, the ark left its own place and went before them -- a most

		But in Deuteronomy there is very little said about the tabernacle of witness or of the congregation, because it is a question of spiritual formation in this book.<a name=38:7></a> There can be no passing on of the testimony <i>merely</i> as a question of light.<a name=38:8></a> Deuteronomy is the period in which the Spirit is operating typically.<a name=38:9></a> He has come in; He comes in after the brazen serpent.<a name=38:10></a> It contemplates, therefore, development, spiritual development in the saints.<a name=38:11></a> Without this the testimony must die out, the light must disappear.<a name=38:12></a> We may have our Bibles, and there are creeds and catechisms, but the testimony is not in these; and precious as the holy Scriptures are, even they do not convey in themselves the full divine thought.<a name=38:13></a> Without spiritual activities, spiritual formation, spiritual growth, the testimony must die.<a name=38:14></a> So that Deuteronomy is not a question of light, of what is objective, that is to say, the tabernacle, but of the subjective work of the Spirit, and all this is fully expressed in the great mediator, in the great figure of Moses; so that it is the words of Moses.<a name=38:15></a> And then we are given the geographical position in which these words were uttered; (chapter 29:1).<a name=38:16></a> Wonderful words!<a name=38:17></a> In chapter after chapter he urges motives for the people to love God.<a name=38:18></a> In a most skilful manner he urges upon

		I have been thinking, dear brethren, of <i>teaching</i>.<a name=63:1></a> You will remember how it is said of an intelligent man, as he is called in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13:7">Acts  13:7</a>, that he was "amazed at the teaching of the Lord".<a name=63:2></a> Being an intelligent man he would have had to do with teaching, but he had not had to do with anything like that which came to his attention in the ministry of Barnabas and Saul.<a name=63:3></a> This is noted in the section in which we are told that Saul was also called <i>Paul</i>.<a name=63:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I turned to John's gospel, therefore, because it emphasises the thought of teaching, especially in its use of the title Rabbi, applying it to the Lord.<a name=63:5></a> It is explained, as you will observe, in this first passage, which I read in order that we should know what was meant.<a name=63:6></a> I apprehend that the title or designation has allusion to distinguished teachers, such as the scribes would aspire to be, as known of men, as the Lord said, "They .<a name=63:7></a>.<a name=63:8></a>.<a name=63:9></a> love .<a name=63:10></a>.<a name=63:11></a>.<a name=63:12></a> to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi", (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#23:5">Matthew  23:5</a> - 7).<a name=63:13></a> The evangelist John emphasises the use of this title as applying to Christ above the other evangelists.<a name=63:14></a> There can be no doubt that he means to convey the distinguished character of the teaching.<a name=63:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I selected the first passage because the title is applied by the two disciples who followed the Lord immediately on His challenging them as to what they sought.<a name=63:16></a> It reminds one of what is known in the scientific world, of which one knows little, of certain subtle forces which attract into their own currents.<a name=63:17></a> So these two who heard John speaking, followed Jesus and immediately find themselves in the drift or current that was moving with Him; for the movement of Christ necessarily moves everything in a

		moral sense, and <i>He</i> was moving, He was walking.<a name=64:1></a> Thus they are, as it were, linking on with the thing, and without there being any premeditation or, so far as we know, any previous knowledge of the Lord, they addressed Him as Rabbi, as if their minds were charged with the idea.<a name=64:2></a> This suggestion ought to appeal to young believers, for they are made conscious, as directed to Christ and as coming under His influence, that teaching is there, that a Teacher, indeed, is there, One of whom they have need.<a name=64:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		They had heard, it says, John speaking.<a name=64:4></a> We are told what He said, but that is not what is emphasised in regard of them; it was a question of the speaking; they heard him "speaking"; it was the kind of subtle spirit, as I may call it, which accompanied the words, more in value in a sense than the words themselves.<a name=64:5></a> As the apostle Paul says, "Whom I serve with my <i>spirit</i> in the gospel of his Son", (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#1:9">Romans  1:9</a>).<a name=64:6></a> In listening to him presenting Christ, the glad tidings of God's Son, the words, of course, would be wonderful, but the spirit of the thing would be more wonderful.<a name=64:7></a> And so we find with Paul; he with Barnabas entered, as we read, into the synagogue "and <i>so spake</i>" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#14:1">Acts  14:1</a>); it is the kind of thing.<a name=64:8></a> So here they heard John speaking, and followed Jesus.<a name=64:9></a> It is, so to speak, one kind of positive linking them on in their spirits with another positive -- a greater.<a name=64:10></a> The work of God in this world involves immensity.<a name=64:11></a> Scientific men indicate to us, indeed we know by observation, what an immensity of variety there is in the physical system; but how much more so in what is spiritual.<a name=64:12></a> John singularly corresponds with the physical system in presenting what is spiritual, not that he takes up the terms, but as under the influence of the Spirit of God he brings the thing forward.<a name=64:13></a> It is a question of the work of God and what accompanies it.<a name=64:14></a> So they heard John speaking wonderful words, to be sure: "Behold the Lamb of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God!<a name=65:1></a>" but it is what was behind the words, the kind of indefinable thing that went with the words, which found correspondence in these disciples; they "heard him speaking, and followed Jesus".<a name=65:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, I want to show how this peculiar influence that was operating linked on in their minds with the abode of Christ, and you will see how obvious it is -- especially young ones -- that in coming into the current of things that the drift is toward a <i>home</i>.<a name=65:3></a> Most of us have been in school in a literal sense, we have had teachers.<a name=65:4></a> You may get a teacher of mathematics, for instance, who is excellent, it may be, but you have no desire to go home with him.<a name=65:5></a> It is not so here.<a name=65:6></a> The Rabbi, the Teacher (for the Holy Spirit is careful to tell us the word means 'Teacher' ), where does He live?<a name=65:7></a> You can see how excellently set this is in John's gospel, because it is the home he wishes to lead us to -- the heavenly home, and so, "Where abidest thou?<a name=65:8></a>" The Lord knew well what was going on in those hearts, but everything is in perfect order here, in keeping with the idea of movement and influence.<a name=65:9></a> The Lord turned and saw them following.<a name=65:10></a> It is as if He were to say to us, If you have got a little light, if you have come in any way under this powerful influence, what effect has it on you?<a name=65:11></a> Is it affecting you?<a name=65:12></a> That is what the Lord would convey to us.<a name=65:13></a> He <i>turned</i>, it says.<a name=65:14></a> Think of what that meant!<a name=65:15></a> It was greater than the sun stopping in the heavens that He should turn round to see two people following: "Jesus turned, and saw them following".<a name=65:16></a> He wishes to convey to us how He prizes the movement that is the fruit of the work of God.<a name=65:17></a> That is what He is looking for; nothing else is of any value.<a name=65:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so, seeing them following, He challenges them, because He would bring out more, for He loves to hear what they have to say, viewed as subjects of the work of God.<a name=65:19></a> The work of God is always true to

		itself, and He knew the extent of it, hence He says, "What seek ye?<a name=66:1></a>" And they say, "Rabbi, where abidest thou?<a name=66:2></a> He says to them, Come and see"; that is to say, the idea of teaching, the drift of it is towards the abiding-place.<a name=66:3></a> Do you think the Lord was silent as they reached that place?<a name=66:4></a> What words would flow from His lips surrounded by the home circumstances, as I may say, the home furnishing, where the rigour of the school, and of the schoolmaster, would be absent!<a name=66:5></a> They would be in the environment of the home and learn there.<a name=66:6></a> What thoughts would be conveyed to them!<a name=66:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What emanates from these remarkable circumstances is the idea of the assembly.<a name=66:8></a> No one can be in the assembly rightly save as taught, and, I may add, taught in the abiding-place; that is to say, you get the impression in the abiding-place and you say, This must be in every way provided for, so that in a world of opposition we may have the home and its comforts and its environment before we reach it in finality.<a name=66:9></a> We are brought to the thing so that we might value it, and as we value it, we conserve it, and we want to see that as far as in us lies that thing is here.<a name=66:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Andrew, therefore, goes and finds his brother Simon and he brings him to Jesus, and Jesus looks on Simon and says, "thou shalt be called Cephas", and again, so that there may be no mistake as to what this means, we are told the word means "a stone".<a name=66:11></a> Now you see the teaching includes the idea of permanency, something that stands the test here.<a name=66:12></a> These disciples were thus receiving their first impressions of Christ, and if the Lord has His way with us, the first impressions He makes on us are the best.<a name=66:13></a> They may need development, we may need to be brought more fully to them, but they are all there.<a name=66:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the name given Simon we have the idea of material for a building, and so you say, This wonderful

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I am not saying that all this is in John, but I am giving the setting of things here, and if you are ready for the teaching of the Lord as John presents it, you are brought into the divine abode; you are impressed with the divine thought initially, and then you are given to understand that you are to be material for the maintenance of that here in this world; that there should be here, where the opposition is so intense and inveterate, material that will stand.<a name=67:7></a> We have the thing in Peter's name: "Thou shalt be called Cephas".<a name=67:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is what I may call the initial lesson in the home instruction.<a name=67:9></a> The home circle is the place for teaching, and that applies literally too.<a name=67:10></a> Whatever schools may be, they never supply affection; in the very nature of them they do not supply affection, nor are they intended to do so, they are intended to teach the elements, whereas John's sphere of teaching is in the home circle, and such a circle!<a name=67:11></a> It is indeed the circle where Jesus abides -- that is the place; and as I said, the subtle drift leads you there.<a name=67:12></a> The mind is drawn that way; and the Lord says, "Come and see", for He loves to see you coming.<a name=67:13></a> Every movement of the work of God is delightful in His eye; it is the movement you see in John resulting from the work of God, "Come and see".<a name=67:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so, too, I would appeal to you, "Come and see" where the Teacher abides -- this great Rabbi that John presents to us.<a name=67:15></a> Nicodemus entitles him similarly -- another man who knew what teaching

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, I want to go on to chapter 7, because in these last days the teaching of the Lord is in accord with John's gospel; it is home teaching.<a name=68:5></a> From the days of the so-called 'Fathers' there has been little or nothing of home teaching; it is lamentable going back in assembly history to note the sudden disappearance of it.<a name=68:6></a> You hardly get any of it outside the Scriptures until you come down to our own times.<a name=68:7></a> In our own times, thank God!<a name=68:8></a> there has been a revival of the idea.<a name=68:9></a> The work of God began to show itself in this connection; it shows itself in movement toward Christ and in desire to be where He is.<a name=68:10></a> The test of it is movement in relation to Him.<a name=68:11></a> In the thought of dioceses, parishes, cathedrals, there is no idea of movement, it is a fixed order of things, nor is there any idea of a home.<a name=68:12></a> They may talk of reservation of the sacrament in these buildings, but does that make them a home?<a name=68:13></a> Not at all!<a name=68:14></a> It makes them idolatrous; there is no 'real presence' in these things at all.<a name=68:15></a> The real presence is in the assembly, and God has brought us back to that; He has brought us back to the idea of the home, the work of God showing itself in response to Christ in this relation.<a name=68:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In our times some heart touched by the Spirit of God in regard of Christ began to speak, and others heard the speaking and they followed Jesus.<a name=68:17></a> No more sectarianism, no more partyism!<a name=68:18></a> It is Jesus and where He abides -- that is John.<a name=68:19></a> And so the teaching, the home teaching has necessarily taken a private or obscure form; and surely we are content to be obscure, if we realise and value the home.<a name=68:20></a> Privacy belongs to the home.<a name=68:21></a> Of course there is public testimony

		but part with Christ in the home precedes it.<a name=69:1></a> That is the drift, beloved, in John's gospel; you get the impression of the home and the teaching there, and you say, I do not want anything outside of that -- that is the thing; no more theology, good-bye to theology and to doctors of divinity now; none of these things belong to the home, to say the least of them.<a name=69:2></a> As I said, all these things are fixed here; you would assume that they are to go on indefinitely; whereas the idea of christianity is movement.<a name=69:3></a> It is a question of following Jesus and hearing speaking of Him; He is moving.<a name=69:4></a> We are going out of the world, going through it and out of it, not setting ourselves up in it.<a name=69:5></a> And so the Lord is walking and John is speaking about Him and the two who heard him speaking follow Jesus, for He is the Teacher.<a name=69:6></a> Much might be said by way of reproach as to the kind of teaching, and the kind of teachers, but there is this teaching of the Lord, there is this distinctive teaching that goes on in relation to the home, and no christian can afford to be without it.<a name=69:7></a> If my speaking this evening were to attract anyone to Christ, one would rejoice, for that is the end of all ministry.<a name=69:8></a> There is such a touch, as in the case of John, such a kind of speaking that the hearers followed Jesus.<a name=69:9></a> They wanted other teaching and they got it, as I said, in the home.<a name=69:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But although all this is obscure and private, as I said, chapter 7 brings in the public side of it.<a name=69:11></a> You will notice, however, that in the beginning of that chapter the Lord is walking in Galilee.<a name=69:12></a> In chapter 1 we are not told where He was walking; but He <i>was</i> walking; whereas in chapter 7 we are told <i>where</i> He was walking; He was walking in Galilee; the allusion is no doubt to the remnant, to remnant times.<a name=69:13></a> There was a murderous element in Judaea, hence the blessed Lord accepted the limitations; He walked no more in Judaea, because they sought to kill Him.<a name=69:14></a>

		The prophetic side of our chapter is extensive, but it is there for us, and I think it ought to be linked up, especially in this gospel, with the Revelation, because the Revelation is to the bondmen of Christ.<a name=87:19></a> It is the "Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:1">Revelation  1:1</a>), that is to say, the Apocalypse is not something the Lord gives of Himself, but is on the line that the Son Himself does not know.<a name=87:20></a> He takes the ground.<a name=87:21></a> The prophetic ministry is received from God.<a name=87:22></a> It is received by Christ and given to His bondman John to show what is shortly coming to pass, that is to say, there is full recognition of God's place in the ordering of the world.<a name=87:23></a> Prophecy has to do with the ordering of the earth, and God is the sovereign Ruler, and the Lord speaks to them on that line.<a name=87:24></a> The Father is Ruler of heaven and earth and things are in His hands.<a name=87:25></a> The Son takes His place mediatorially as

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=92:1></a> We dwelt on a previous occasion on the earlier and closing verses of chapter 13, first dwelling at length on the Lord, as it says, "going out of the temple", (verse 1) and the remark of one of His disciples as to the stones and buildings, as if to call attention to the things considered of value in that which the Lord was leaving.<a name=92:2></a> Then the Lord answering said, "Seest thou these great buildings?<a name=92:3></a> not a stone shall be left upon a stone, which shall not be thrown down", (verse 2).<a name=92:4></a> The overthrow of what seemed so important in the eyes of the disciple is announced, and that would deliver the disciple -- or those whom he represented -- from the thing the Lord was leaving.<a name=92:5></a> Then the Lord takes a seat on the mount of Olives, regarding it, I believe, as the representation of christianity as centring in the Spirit of God.<a name=92:6></a> "He sat", as it says, "on the mount of Olives <i>opposite</i> the temple", (verse 3).<a name=92:7></a> Sitting means in this connection not a temporary position but an abiding one; and there are four persons, not called disciples, who express in their names four distinguished things amongst the saints, who come and ask Him privately when these things should be.<a name=92:8></a> He warns them at the outset to be on their guard that they should not be misled.<a name=92:9></a> The first great suggestion as to taking up a position according to light is to be on our guard that we be not diverted from it.<a name=92:10></a> Then we spoke on the closing verses as relating to the present time also, the body of the chapter having reference to the prophetic side of things which was in the hands of God.<a name=92:11></a> The Lord tells His disciples those matters were in His Father's hands, even He did not know, which points to the book of Revelation as coming from God to Christ, and from Christ to John,

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have been thinking, dear brethren, of building material, having in view that this is the time of building, and if it is a time of building there must be material.<a name=108:1></a> Thus I have read from Haggai, a well-known prophet, not only because he speaks of building and of material, but because he took part in the work himself.<a name=108:2></a> Many of us can speak of what is needed and urge others on, but what God looks for is a leader, and to give a lead I must go on ahead.<a name=108:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So we find with Haggai, and his associate prophet, Zechariah, that they not only urged the builders to build, but it says <i>they helped</i> in the work -- "the prophets of God helping", as we read.<a name=108:4></a> One who thus puts his hand to the work deserved special attention, and I may add that prophecy is that which in the first epistle to the Corinthians is especially commended for building.<a name=108:5></a> Of the gifts, each of which is of value, prophecy was commended.<a name=108:6></a> Before, however, commending the gift of prophecy, the apostle said, "yet shew I unto you a way of more surpassing excellence" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:31">1 Corinthians  12:31</a>); he could not only speak of the way of love but <i>show</i> it.<a name=108:7></a> It is a thing rather to be shown than defined, and so having shown that way, he goes back to the subject of gift and urges prophecy, for he that prophesieth edifies or builds the assembly.<a name=108:8></a> So Haggai, associated with Zechariah, demands special attention, as a man who, in a day of very small things, spoke the mind of God.<a name=108:9></a> He also builded, worked with the others, with the rank and file of the people, as we may say.<a name=108:10></a>

		material, and we should note what it is.<a name=109:1></a> What elements form the physical system around us, or what the primary materials were, we can say but little, but we are not left in any uncertainty or cloudiness as regards the material needed for God's building.<a name=109:2></a> The first building that we get in Scripture, as has often been pointed out, is in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2">Genesis  2</a>, but we read of the foundations of the earth being laid, which I suppose may be taken to lead to building.<a name=109:3></a> The word employed directly for the physical system is 'framed': "By faith we apprehend that the worlds were framed by the word of God", (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:3">Hebrews  11:3</a>).<a name=109:4></a> The first <i>building</i> is that recorded in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2">Genesis  2</a>, and there is nothing vague as to the material.<a name=109:5></a> It was a rib taken out of Adam, and out of that, we are told, God builded a woman.<a name=109:6></a> The material therefore was to be understood as the building was there, and so in the New Testament we have the material for God's building.<a name=109:7></a> The Lord is very explicit, first in regard of the foundation upon which He would build, and then in regard of the material which He would use in the building.<a name=109:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First He says, "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona".<a name=109:9></a> (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:17">Matthew  16:17</a>).<a name=109:10></a> Now that, taken as it is, is not material for the building.<a name=109:11></a> Simon Bar-jona refers to the believer as he is <i>here</i>, born in this world, whose history is known; such a one is blessed, that is to say, as a responsible person here, having had a sinful history, you, like Simon who acknowledged his sinfulness, are blessed.<a name=109:12></a> "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona".<a name=109:13></a> But that was only a part of the Lord's pronouncement, a part which involves much in principle, indeed, involving the epistle to the Romans, which contemplates us as responsible.<a name=109:14></a> Yet as convicted sinners who believe through grace, we are blessed.<a name=109:15></a> But then the Lord goes on with a new thing.<a name=109:16></a> What He says about Simon being blessed as receiving a revelation from God was not exactly a new thing, because the

		reception of revelations of God was not new.<a name=110:1></a> Many before him had received such, not of that kind, of course, but nevertheless many had received revelations from God, and they were blessed.<a name=110:2></a> It was a blessed thing in each case.<a name=110:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the Lord goes on as if He were saying something extraordinary, "flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens".<a name=110:4></a> <i>He</i> has revealed that to you, "And I also, I say unto thee that thou art Peter".<a name=110:5></a> That is not a mere question of blessing, not that I would minimise blessing, but it is a question of material: "Thou <i>art</i> Peter", the Lord said.<a name=110:6></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:42">John  1:42</a>, the corresponding passage, He says, "Thou shalt be <i>called</i> Cephas", and then the Holy Spirit tells us the meaning of that word so that we should understand.<a name=110:7></a> Whenever the Holy Spirit interprets a word He means to impress it on our minds that we may understand it, so that in John we get the interpretation of the word 'Cephas'.<a name=110:8></a> The Lord did not use that word in speaking to Peter in Matthew.<a name=110:9></a> He used, as far as we can see, the ordinary word Peter.<a name=110:10></a> We have no word to be interpreted, it was a word that was known, the Greek word for Peter, that is to say, the material was divinely provided, and the builder has to understand, has to distinguish in himself between "Simon Bar-jona", being blessed, and "Peter", if he is to have part practically, and surely, in the great system which God is building, the great spiritual system for, from this point of view, wood, hay, and stubble have no part at all.<a name=110:11></a> They <i>cannot</i> be introduced.<a name=110:12></a> It is what the Lord Jesus Christ is building, and He never used any extraneous material at all.<a name=110:13></a> The material was there, He gave it a name, He pronounced upon it, and then He says, "on this rock I will build my assembly".<a name=110:14></a> Having designated the material for the building, He speaks of the foundation.<a name=110:15></a>

		Having spoken of Luke and Matthew, I want to open out the link between Matthew and Ephesians.<a name=112:5></a> The apostle, as you will remember, reached Ephesus by "the upper districts", (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#19:1">Acts  19:1</a>).<a name=112:6></a> He had been there before he left Aquila and Priscilla there, and went off elsewhere in his service, and in the interval Apollos arrived and was instructed by Aquila and Priscilla.<a name=112:7></a> Apollos goes to Corinth, where Paul had been, and where he had built up the lower line of things, that is to say, the order of God in a city, in a locality.<a name=112:8></a> He had been to Athens, and there was not a word said to him in Athens about God having His people there, although there were a few; but arriving at Corinth he associates himself with two tent-makers, a man and his wife.<a name=112:9></a> This was not a vain appearance of things; he meant it, he lodged with them and the Holy Spirit tells us he wrought with his hands; he was a real worker, making tents.<a name=112:10></a> You will see we are coming down to everyday life, and it is important to see that the people of God are seen in that connection.<a name=112:11></a> The Lord said, "and no one shall set upon thee to injure thee; because I have much people in this city", (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#18:10">Acts  18:10</a>).<a name=112:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I thought that might furnish a subject for inquiry at this time, how that in Luke the interest of the Lord in going after them is evident, and that recovery is through their minds, or intelligences.<a name=121:9></a> It is not exactly a shepherd using external means to bring the sheep back, but He operates in a moral way, through the intelligence and the heart, the result of which was that they returned to Jerusalem "the same hour", having <i>recognised</i> Him in the breaking of bread.<a name=121:10></a> So that material for the assembly in Luke has the public position in view; it is a <i>gathered company</i>, and the breaking of bread is a great feature of it.<a name=121:11></a>

		J.T.<a name=153:1></a> Here the Lord is seen going through the country, city by city, and village by village, preaching and announcing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God, after certain events -- "afterwards", it says.<a name=153:2></a> The mind is directed to what preceded, especially in chapter 7, in which we have attention called to a state of things governed by grace.<a name=153:3></a> The presence of the Lord here, from Luke's point of view, involves the spreading abroad of the principle of grace -- the influence of it.<a name=153:4></a> So that chapter 7 calls attention to the incident of the centurion and other occurrences, showing that the principle of grace had spread abroad and was being effective; the knowledge that the centurion had of the Lord, and his own relation with the Jews; then the dealing with death, and John the baptist's ministry.<a name=153:5></a> Chapter 7 thus shows the bearing and effect of the grace of the Lord's ministry and the exposure of what was contrary to it.<a name=153:6></a> The Old Testament -- what came down through John -- was merged in what the Lord was doing, so that there is adjustment.<a name=153:7></a> The Pharisees and the lawyers are exposed, and all the people and the publicans are said to have justified God, being baptised by John.<a name=153:8></a> There is thus adjustment, and the full result of grace is seen evidently in the woman who anointed the Lord.<a name=153:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=222:17></a> I think that is the point.<a name=222:18></a> As He prayed, in chapter 3, the Holy Spirit came down, and a voice out of heaven said, "Thou art my beloved Son".<a name=222:19></a> Then in chapter 5 He prays, and the power of the Lord is there; it says, "The Lord's power was there to heal them"; it was a question of prayer.<a name=222:20></a> Then in chapter 6 He prays all night, and the apostles are brought in and He names them.<a name=222:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=222:24></a> That is the idea; not only on earth, but above, so that the idea goes right into heaven; the point is that God owns it, for it is as He prayed that He was changed.<a name=222:25></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have been thinking of certain public features that mark the present time, the end, as I may say, of this wonderful dispensation; corresponding somewhat with the end of the previous one.<a name=318:1></a> Certain public features marked the end of the Jewish dispensation.<a name=318:2></a> There were also private features, that is to say, what transpired in the upper room at Jerusalem on the evening of the Lord's crucifixion, and other like occurrences.<a name=318:3></a> So there are private features today, features that are not taken account of currently in a public way; they influence what is public, but they remain mysterious and private, known to those who love the Lord.<a name=318:4></a> The public features may be known to others and may be written about by others, but the private features are known only to those who love the Lord.<a name=318:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have here, alluded to by the Lord Himself, a certain action of Pilate, who was the governor of Judaea; and the fall of the tower of Siloam and the destruction of eighteen persons by it.<a name=318:6></a> Then we have alluded to, in a parabolic way, the whole Jewish system viewed, as you will observe, under the figure of the fig-tree.<a name=318:7></a> These are in the main public things.<a name=318:8></a> And then we have mentioned by the Spirit the service of the Lord Jesus; not His private service, but His public service; He was serving in the synagogue on the sabbath.<a name=318:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is important that we should take account of these public matters.<a name=318:10></a> Some make much of them, however, and ignore the private side.<a name=318:11></a> We hear much of public occurrences in the East, pointing to the end of things, and these occurrences cannot but be of

	<div class="paragraph">
		interest, but they are not the <i>main</i> guide for the saints at the present time.<a name=319:1></a> The private features are the surer.<a name=319:2></a> I was seeking to illustrate this in speaking to a sister today (I had not thought of it before).<a name=319:3></a> If a man of importance, of dignity, is away from his house and his family, and his return is left uncertain -- <i>purposely</i> so -- we do not look for the farm-hands or servants generally to have the first tidings of his return, we rather seek to get near to those whom he loves and who love him.<a name=319:4></a> If things be in secret, and there are any inklings of information as to his return, we may be assured that those whom he loves, his wife and his family, will have the first.<a name=319:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So it is that the Lord has left, designedly, the time of His return in uncertainty, as regards ourselves; He has, however, assured us that He comes <i>quickly</i>.<a name=319:6></a> Others may assume that they can fix the date.<a name=319:7></a> The false wife in Proverbs (as an illustration) says, The husband is away from home, he has gone on a <i>long journey</i>, he has taken a bag of money with him; (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#7:19">Proverbs  7:19</a>,20).<a name=319:8></a> All that she says is to convey the impression that the period of his absence is to be extended and long.<a name=319:9></a> She says he will return at the time of the full moon; she puts it in the distance, not the <i>new</i> moon, but the full moon.<a name=319:10></a> Her great antitype, the Babylonish system, says, "I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#18:7">Revelation  18:7</a>) -- the husband is ignored by her.<a name=319:11></a> She is riding upon the beast, she is occupied guiltily with the kings of the earth; as for the coming of the Lord, it is left out.<a name=319:12></a> Another, a wicked servant, says, "My lord" (he acknowledges his lord) "delayeth his coming" -- he does not regret it -- and, in the meantime, he smites his fellow-servants; (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#24:48">Matthew  24:48</a>,49).<a name=319:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So that you see how those who are non-lovers of Christ, guilty non-lovers of Christ, put His coming off, or ignore it altogether; whereas, "he which testifieth these things", in His very last words to us,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=320>[Page 320]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		says, "Surely I come quickly", and the lovers say, "Even so, come, Lord Jesus", (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:20">Revelation  22:20</a>).<a name=320:1></a> These are the ones who get the inklings of it; whatever waves of His power are acting, they touch them first, it is quite obvious.<a name=320:2></a> So that the inward or private signs or intimations of the coming of the Lord are much surer than the external ones.<a name=320:3></a> The external ones, these international events, may confirm our spiritual impressions, but these latter afford the primary guidance.<a name=320:4></a> The lovers of God and the lovers of Christ are occupied with the works of God; they recognise the course of this world of course -- Scripture does, specially the book of Revelation -- but the positive thing is what we should look for and rely on; what the Holy Spirit is doing in consonance with Christ in heaven, how He is acting in the people of the Lord, the members of the assembly, the members of His body.<a name=320:5></a> The members of the body of Christ come <i>directly</i> under His influence.<a name=320:6></a> These outer things, international occurrences, do not come under His influence directly; they do not even come under the direct government of God, but only His indirect government.<a name=320:7></a> We look for what is going on within; as I said in my illustration, what the wife knows, what the children know, they may not be able to tell you in so many words, but they have got impressions, they have got inklings, and they are governed accordingly.<a name=320:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So we find the Lord saying in another parable -- the parable of the virgins -- that at midnight there was a cry, "Behold, the bridegroom; go forth to meet him", (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#25:6">Matthew  25:6</a>).<a name=320:9></a> That was not an appeal to the nations, it was an appeal to the lovers of Christ.<a name=320:10></a> There were those who had that place -- five of them were foolish, and five of them were wise, but there was a movement, it was a spiritual movement, it was a movement in answer to a cry: "Behold, the bridegroom".<a name=320:11></a> You see, it was an appeal to affection, not
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=321>[Page 321]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		simply that He comes, but, "Behold, the bridegroom".<a name=321:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Holy Spirit would occupy the hearts of the saints with <i>Christ</i>.<a name=321:2></a> There was a movement, and it took the form of preparation and going forth to meet a person.<a name=321:3></a> How real it was!<a name=321:4></a> It was not an event that was called attention to, but a person; and those in direct relationship with Christ come under the influence of it first; that is where you get the inkling.<a name=321:5></a> The wise virgins knew what was necessary and had oil in their lamps.<a name=321:6></a> The oil points to the presence in them of the Spirit of God.<a name=321:7></a> The foolish virgins were without it, their lamps went out; whereas the five wise virgins, that is to say, those who are real christians, and who really love Christ, those who have the Spirit of God -- they go to meet Him and go in to the wedding with Him.<a name=321:8></a> They are the ones to be noted; there is light in their movements.<a name=321:9></a> See what they are doing!<a name=321:10></a>

		Now, certain came to the Lord and called His attention to what Pilate had done.<a name=321:11></a> It was an atrocious act, a cruel thing, to mix with the sacrifices the blood of certain Galileans.<a name=321:12></a> It does not appear that they were vicious people; they were Galileans.<a name=321:13></a> Our times have been marked by such public occurrences, and we may be as much misled in regard to them as these people were in regard to Pilate's atrocious act.<a name=321:14></a> The Lord neither condemns Pilate nor justifies his victims.<a name=321:15></a> It is a question of seeing how matters are at the present time; why in the government of God such awful calamities, as we may say, come over the world, over christendom.<a name=321:16></a> Perhaps we say, Certain nations are more wicked.<a name=321:17></a> Will the Lord listen to us?<a name=321:18></a> No; He will not listen to us.<a name=321:19></a> Let us not flatter ourselves that our immediate nation or nations are any better.<a name=321:20></a> The Lord would wish us to have a right understanding of things; He says, "I tell you .<a name=321:21></a>.<a name=321:22></a>.<a name=321:23></a> except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish".<a name=321:24></a> Terrible prospect!<a name=321:25></a> It is well that the people of God should

	<div class="paragraph">
		And then there are great physical and other such catastrophes, the late war, earthquakes, fires and the like, causing immense damage -- such as the fall of the tower of Siloam; we are not to be deceived by such happenings.<a name=322:2></a> Unless they have a moral effect upon us, they are lost upon us; we may talk about them, write about them, and fix dates by them, and say, The end of things is at hand, but if there is no moral effect, these things are lost upon us.<a name=322:3></a> In the government of God He allows them to arouse repentance, so that at least <i>some</i> might be saved.<a name=322:4></a> Think of the awfulness -- as you look abroad today on this favoured part of the world, western Europe and its outgoings -- of what is going to happen to it!<a name=322:5></a> The Lord in one short sentence shows the present bearing of it -- "Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish".<a name=322:6></a> What a serious matter this is!<a name=322:7></a> As we look at this nation and all the nations and their enterprises, what effect has what God allows in His government on them!<a name=322:8></a> There is utter indifference.<a name=322:9></a> But the word is, "Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish".<a name=322:10></a>

		Now He speaks a parable, "A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none".<a name=322:11></a> Now we are in the presence of the patience of God.<a name=322:12></a> But in His patience He looks for fruit.<a name=322:13></a> If He has given His Son to die, and raised Him and set Him in heaven and sent down the Spirit, and the Spirit has remained here for all these centuries, God has something in view.<a name=322:14></a> As He had something in view in Israel, so He has something in view in christendom.<a name=322:15></a> He has spent much more on us than He spent on Israel.<a name=322:16></a> Think of the cost to Him that there should exist the present order of things.<a name=322:17></a> I mean, the sphere in which the Lord Jesus is owned, and in which God works specially; in which His love has been and is being

		THE DIVINE STANDARD OF SERVICE (2)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#2">2 Corinthians  2</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=349:1></a> Our remarks this morning were largely preliminary.<a name=349:2></a> No doubt the Lord will help us in looking into these two chapters, as having their own voice and bearing on the subject before us; first in the apostle's evident effort to inspire confidence in the Corinthians, linking himself up with their local affairs and exercises, telling them that his hope for them was sure, and then in carefully meeting the feeling amongst them that there was insincerity or even prevarication in his methods.<a name=349:3></a> This rendered his position in writing the letter extremely difficult, but we may learn from it how to deal with such circumstances in our service, for we may be sure that in serving Christ we cannot but meet them, the enemy being ever ready to instil insinuations and lack of confidence.<a name=349:4></a> So the apostle links them up with himself as far as possible in what he was going through, and he links himself up with what they were enduring, thus making assembly exercises, as we speak of them, universal in bearing, whether arising from certain local conditions or otherwise.<a name=349:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.H.<a name=349:6></a> So both the epistles to the Corinthians are left on record to help us in such exercises right down to the very end.<a name=349:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=349:8></a> That is quite evident.<a name=349:9></a> What is before us now especially is to see how one in the place of service is to act when evil or opposition arises in those whom he serves.<a name=349:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.H.<a name=349:11></a> The apostle had been in the third heaven fourteen years before all this, but besides that he had been through much tribulation, despairing even of life, experiences which justified his taking up these exercises with the saints.<a name=349:12></a>

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=350>[Page 350]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=350:1></a> Yes; previous experience is made to tell in the letter in dealing with such conditions.<a name=350:2></a> The Lord enables His servants to use what resources they have, for every servant ought to have his <i>own</i> resources.<a name=350:3></a> Of course, our resources are in Christ, but there are resources arising from experience with Him peculiar to each of us.<a name=350:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=350:5></a> Would the first epistle, portraying the desperate state into which things had fallen at Corinth, have a special bearing on our time, coming in on the corrective line, and the second epistle bringing in what is positive growing out of the first?<a name=350:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=350:7></a> Yes, and I think it grows, too, out of the experience that intervened with the apostle himself, so that there is a certain analogy between this epistle and the <i>towel</i> used by our Lord in wiping the feet of the disciples after washing them.<a name=350:8></a> The first epistle bears strong relation to the <i>water</i> which was poured into a "washhand basin"; it was a portable vessel, and thus the Lord <i>came</i> to each; it says, "He comes therefore to Simon Peter" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#13:5">John  13:5</a>,6), the service not requiring that they should go to Him.<a name=350:9></a> The apostle would readily have gone to Corinth, if by going he could have done as well or better than he could do by the letter.<a name=350:10></a> It was a question, as he tells us in this chapter, of love's calculation.<a name=350:11></a> Love's reckoning kept him away, not any want of self-sacrifice, so that the water reached them and did its work.<a name=350:12></a> Now he is approaching them, I apprehend, with the towel, which arises largely from the experience that intervened, on which he dwells at length in the opening part of the first chapter, an experience which brought God in perhaps in a way not otherwise known.<a name=350:13></a> God was brought in, and thus in being brought down and finding God in the circumstances one gains and becomes more effective in the service.<a name=350:14></a> So that we should notice the place that <i>God</i> has in these two chapters in relation to the apostle's experience.<a name=350:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		D.L.<a name=351:1></a>H.<a name=351:2></a> There was a good remark once made by a well-known brother amongst us that the first epistle to the Corinthians suggests the use of golden snuffers, connected with the tabernacle system of things, and that this second epistle is rather the oil beaten for the light.<a name=351:3></a> The apostle seems to have gone through a good deal in that connection himself, so that he was able to minister the necessary oil to keep the light burning, as in this epistle.<a name=351:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=351:5></a> Yes, that rather confirms it from another view.<a name=351:6></a>

		J.T.<a name=351:10></a> We do, and these chapters emphasise the minister.<a name=351:11></a> All the chapters do, we may say, but the circumstances experienced between the two epistles gave remarkable occasion for God to come in, and it is "God who raises the dead", (chapter 1:9).<a name=351:12></a> The encouragement received thus by the apostle was for the gain of the Corinthians.<a name=351:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=351:14></a> Is the idea to establish mutual confidence and feeling between the servant and those served?<a name=351:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=351:16></a> I thought so.<a name=351:17></a> Paul seems to link up the Corinthians with those experiences: "Ye also labouring together by supplication for us that the gift towards us, through means of many persons, may be the subject of the thanksgiving of many for us" (chapter 1:11).<a name=351:18></a> Their supplication is recognised, and it is suggested that there should be thanksgiving.<a name=351:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.S.<a name=351:20></a>L.<a name=351:21></a> As to the line of experience with God in view of the service, is it not necessary that all in some measure should go through the experience that Paul describes in the first chapter: "We ourselves had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not have our trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead" (verse 9)?<a name=351:22></a> Have we not to learn in some little way what it is to come to the end of all resources, to be at our wit's end, and to cry unto the Lord?<a name=351:23></a> And

	<div class="paragraph">

		J.T.<a name=352:13></a> That is what he brings out here and he links on the Corinthians in the most skilful manner with his experiences, bringing in their supplications.<a name=352:14></a> It is the part the saints have in fellowship with those who serve them.<a name=352:15></a> The supplications are by many persons, and then the thanksgiving is by many.<a name=352:16></a> The work of God thus proceeds in the most mutual way, for, after all, there is a great interdependence between those who serve and those who are served.<a name=352:17></a> And then there is the plain assertion of his veracity in all he was doing.<a name=352:18></a>

		I have been thinking of late of the women of whom we have records by the Holy Spirit in the different books of Scripture, particularly in the typical books of the Old Testament and in the gospel narratives.<a name=375:1></a> These women, if rightly considered in relation to one another, set out the result which the Spirit of God would work in His people in relation to the light presented in each book.<a name=375:2></a> I have selected John this evening, having spoken of other books elsewhere, particularly Luke.<a name=375:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Luke has in view <i>subjection</i> in the people of God, and so there we have emphasis laid on Mary the mother of our Lord.<a name=375:4></a> As having heard the communications of Gabriel, she says, "Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word", (chapter 1:38).<a name=375:5></a> She is subject.<a name=375:6></a> Many women might be noted throughout the book as bearing constructively on what is set out in Mary.<a name=375:7></a> At the end of Luke we have women who, as loving the Lord, were at the sepulchre and received word relative to Him from the two men whom they saw there, and it says they returned from the sepulchre and told all these things to the <i>eleven</i>; that is, these women recognised the authoritative representatives of Christ; that is the sure result of the gospel of Luke as rightly apprehended.<a name=375:8></a> As subject, we shall not fail to recognise what represents Him in any way authoritatively.<a name=375:9></a> It adds, "And to all the rest", (chapter 24:9) We shall, as subject to Christ, surely have some communications from Him, and we shall place those communications where they can be made best use of, where they can be best disposed of.<a name=375:10></a> They will not be trodden under the foot of man, for the communications that we receive from the Lord

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so later in the same chapter we have the two restored ones who, having come back from Emmaus, "found the eleven", (verse 33).<a name=376:4></a> As having wandered from Christ and divine principles, some have difficulty in finding those who seek to maintain the authority of Christ, not that they are hidden away exactly, but the difficulty arises because of our dark thoughts, the darkness that accrues from wandering.<a name=376:5></a> But the two found the eleven.<a name=376:6></a> It is important for anyone seeking light to find the eleven, that is, those who represent the Lord in some way, it may be in a broken way, for there are only eleven here, whereas there had been twelve; nevertheless there were the eleven who represented the Lord, "and those with them", and they were "gathered together".<a name=376:7></a> That is the sure result, as I said, of understanding Luke -- subjection, and the recognition of those who represent the Lord as seeking to maintain His authority.<a name=376:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in John we have another view, inclusive of Luke indeed, for there can be nothing for God without subjection, but John has in view what is <i>spiritual</i>, not only that we should be subject to Christ, as it is said, the assembly is subjected to Christ, and the Holy Spirit is operating to bring that about, but that we should enter into the greatest and best thoughts of God, for He withholds nothing now.<a name=376:9></a> It is a wonderful time; it is a time of unparalleled privilege; a time in which God is unfolding to us His very best.<a name=376:10></a> He has come out in His beloved Son, according to this evangelist, and so the great truth of the Person of the Son is immediately stated: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the

		Word was God", (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:1">John  1:1</a>).<a name=377:1></a> We are notified at once of the immense fact that the Word was in the beginning, that is, the One who unfolds the thoughts of God is not only from the beginning, but He was <i>in</i> it.<a name=377:2></a> "In the beginning <i>was</i> the Word".<a name=377:3></a> That One who has been talking to you, and telling you of God, was in the beginning.<a name=377:4></a> He was <i>in</i> it, and He was in it not in any inferior sense; He was <i>God</i>.<a name=377:5></a> In taking up things which relate to divine Persons we are slow to apprehend the magnitude of what we are dealing with.<a name=377:6></a> "No man hath seen God", says the evangelist, "at anytime; the only-begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath <i>declared</i> him", (verse 18).<a name=377:7></a> The <i>Word</i> conveys the thought of speaking.<a name=377:8></a> The glorious One presented in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:1">John  1:1</a> has actually spoken to me!<a name=377:9></a> How affecting!<a name=377:10></a> If He has not spoken to you, well, you know very little -- you know nothing first-hand.<a name=377:11></a> John would have us get things first-hand, and he emphasises that the Person who brings things to us is the Word -- He is the One who <i>speaks</i>.<a name=377:12></a> What, you say, the One who has spoken to me?<a name=377:13></a> Yes; that very One.<a name=377:14></a> When He was here the speaking was general, for He says, "If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin; but now they have no cloke for their sin", (<a href="../bible/John.htm#15:22">John  15:22</a>).<a name=377:15></a> You see the wonderful speaking; by it the sin of the Jews was exposed and could not be covered up.<a name=377:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Immediately He is here as the Word become flesh, it is recorded: "We have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father, full of grace and truth", (verse 14).<a name=378:2></a> And then John the baptist, who is brought in by this evangelist as representing service according to God, bears witness, as if the picture must be complete, and what did he witness?<a name=378:3></a> "After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me", (verse 15).<a name=378:4></a> He is that -- the One who was in the beginning.<a name=378:5></a> Name any dignitary in the Old Testament, any angelic dignitary, and you will come to it that every one will have to say, "He was before me".<a name=378:6></a> Than John the baptist there was none greater born of woman, as the Lord says, and he says of the Lord, He "is preferred before me".<a name=378:7></a> Surely He is preferred!<a name=378:8></a> Preferred by whom?<a name=378:9></a> By God, and I hope by all of us.<a name=378:10></a> I hope Jesus is preferred by all of us to any other man or being in heaven or on earth, however great.<a name=378:11></a> This gospel delivers us from the influence of men in these our days, when they have such a place even with the saints of God.<a name=378:12></a> John says, He "is preferred before me".<a name=378:13></a> He does not say by whom, but presently two of his own disciples prefer Jesus to him.<a name=378:14></a> Not that they despised John, far from it; he was not to be despised; the Lord would not have that; no one knew his worth more than Jesus, and He spoke of it.<a name=378:15></a> But these two disciples heard John <i>speaking</i> -- that is John, as it were, exercising his powers; they heard John speaking about Christ and they left him; they preferred Jesus.<a name=378:16></a> That is a voice.<a name=378:17></a> I wonder if we have all preferred Him, preferred Him to all others?<a name=378:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in the light of that, we are told later that John the baptist says of Him that He comes <i>from heaven</i>; not only that He was in the beginning and was with God and was God, but He comes from

		I take the Samaritan woman first (in her own order, indeed, in the book), and what I deduce from the instruction is that she represents the thought of a <i>vessel</i>.<a name=379:7></a> It is a very simple suggestion, and one that fits in peculiarly with this gospel, because the idea is prominently introduced in chapter 2 in connection with the marriage at Cana of Galilee.<a name=379:8></a> You will remember that there were six water-<i>vessels</i>, as they are called; they were stone "water-vessels".<a name=379:9></a> They were there, but they were empty, but vessels are not made to be empty; they are made to be used.<a name=379:10></a> In truth each one of us is a vessel, and is to possess it, according to another scripture, in sanctification and honour; (<a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#4:4">1 Thessalonians  4:4</a>).<a name=379:11></a> So we get this woman, an unlikely person to be a vessel from the point of view from which I am speaking, an unlikely person, I mean, to the natural mind, but what is unlikely to that mind is quite likely in God's mind, for He thinks not as man thinks; He looks at the heart.<a name=379:12></a> And moreover God looks at us potentially, that is to say, not only according to what we may be now, but what we shall be; He takes us up from that point of view.<a name=379:13></a> And so, as I said, there were those six stone water-vessels unfilled.<a name=379:14></a> They were for the moment

		Now to illustrate what I have in my mind briefly I would remark on the Lord's reference in Luke to Elijah.<a name=380:8></a> He says, that there were many widows in Israel in his days, but "to none of them was Elias sent but to Sarepta of Sidonia, to a woman that was a widow", (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4:26">Luke  4:26</a>).<a name=380:9></a> He was sent to Zarephath, Jehovah saying to Elijah, "I have commanded a widow woman there to maintain thee", (<a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#17:9">1 Kings  17:9</a>).<a name=380:10></a> He had already commanded the ravens to <i>feed</i> him, but <i>maintaining</i> is a very different thing; it signifies that he was to be looked after <i>suitably</i>, and some of the most important things in a household in connection with the maintaining of a guest are vessels.<a name=380:11></a> I just touch on the woman of Zarephath as very striking and illustrative of what I have in my mind.<a name=380:12></a> She is gathering sticks outside the town as Elijah reaches it, and he calls to her and says, "Fetch me a little water <i>in a vessel</i>", (verse 10).<a name=380:13></a> You might say, Why mention the vessel?<a name=380:14></a> If she is to bring water, she cannot bring it in the palm of her hand.<a name=380:15></a> But the point is, the water is to be brought in a vessel.<a name=380:16></a> In replying, she tells Elijah about her poverty, but she had the idea of a vessel; she says, I have "but a handful of meal <i>in a barrel</i>" -- it was in a barrel, in a vessel, where it should be; "and a little oil in a <i>cruse</i>" (verse 12) -- where it should be.<a name=380:17></a> I mention that because if we are to be spiritual in regard of ourselves and our vessels, we must apprehend that the vessel is to be used by God; we are to be vessels unto honour, sanctified and meet for the Master's use.<a name=380:18></a> And so you find in the chapter referring to that widow that

		And so under Elisha's ministry (his being the counterpart of Elijah's) the widow of one of the sons of the prophets was in straits; the creditor was about to take her sons; she had not anything at all in the house but a little oil in a pot -- she too had it in a vessel; that was what she had in the house.<a name=381:3></a> Now the house is mentioned, that is to say, the believer's establishment, it is a question of what I am myself.<a name=381:4></a> The house refers to my own establishment, and it is how things are there.<a name=381:5></a> What have you got there?<a name=381:6></a> You say, I have got much in heaven.<a name=381:7></a> Thank God!<a name=381:8></a> Christ is in heaven.<a name=381:9></a> But what is down here?<a name=381:10></a> The Holy Spirit is down here.<a name=381:11></a> But where is the Holy Spirit?<a name=381:12></a> He is not in the air; He is not in the elements; where is He?<a name=381:13></a> He is in you, if you are a believer; He is in believers, He is in the house of God.<a name=381:14></a> On the day of Pentecost, it says, It "sat upon each of them" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:3">Acts  2:3</a>) -- not elsewhere.<a name=381:15></a> The sound filled the house, and cloven tongues as of fire sat on each of them, and then the effect on them was that they spoke with other tongues.<a name=381:16></a> The Spirit had come and He was <i>in</i> them.<a name=381:17></a> "These are not drunken, as ye suppose", Peter said, (verse 15).<a name=381:18></a> They were filled with the Spirit; He was <i>in</i> them.<a name=381:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Sisters in a town are extremely interesting.<a name=386:2></a> Of course we know they were sisters in the flesh, but they were also sisters spiritually.<a name=386:3></a> There were sisters who in earlier days were not very congenial to one another; I refer to the two at Philippi who are enjoined to be of the same mind in the Lord (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#4:2">Philippians  4:2</a>); not one in regard of some social link or object, for it is remarkable how we are brought together by the most wretched things, so that, we are of one mind to <i>that</i> extent, but the point is to be of "the same mind <i>in the Lord</i>".<a name=386:4></a> So here it says, the sisters sent to the Lord; two sisters sending a message to Jesus is very beautiful, and the message was this, "he whom thou lovest is sick".<a name=386:5></a> Surely we can see the appropriateness of a message like that sent from many of our gatherings -- the needfulness of it, for many are spiritually sick.<a name=386:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That word reaches Jesus, for it says, "When Jesus heard that" (He heard it undoubtedly from the two sisters), He said, "This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby".<a name=386:7></a> A magnificent answer!<a name=386:8></a> "<i>This</i> sickness is not unto death".<a name=386:9></a> <i>Some</i> sicknesses are very solemn indeed; "There is a sin unto death", John says; (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:16">1 John  5:16</a>).<a name=386:10></a> You may be a sick person, and the sickness may mean that, but not so in the case of Lazarus.<a name=386:11></a> Such things in John's gospel are not governmental.<a name=386:12></a> The man in chapter 9 was not blind because he had sinned or his parents, but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.<a name=386:13></a> God is working from Himself, and if there be the sickness of a loved one, it is not unto death, it is for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified thereby.<a name=386:14></a>

		But Mary Magdalene completes the picture of spirituality from this point of view.<a name=389:7></a> Chapter 20 introduces the first day of the week and Mary is in full view, as if that is the thing the mind of God is set upon for the coming eternity.<a name=389:8></a> The chapter begins thus: "The first day of the week .<a name=389:9></a>.<a name=389:10></a>.<a name=389:11></a> <i>Mary</i>".<a name=389:12></a> There she is; and she moves in agility as did the Lord Himself; He was moving like 'the hind of the morning', as depicted in the psalm.<a name=389:13></a> She <i>runs</i> to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved.<a name=389:14></a> It says, too, that she remained without at the sepulchre, as they "went away again to their own home", and she looked into it and saw two angels sitting, one at the head and the other at the feet where the body of Jesus had lain.<a name=389:15></a> The picture, as I understand it, is this -- these angels represented Old Testament administration, wonderful administration, but they are sitting now at the head and the feet of Jesus.<a name=389:16></a> That is where they were, as if all else was given up, and they were now taken up with the glorious Person who had come in.<a name=389:17></a> But He is not there.<a name=389:18></a> He <i>was</i> there, and these angels show what heaven thought of Him, and the woman is to understand it; she saw it.<a name=389:19></a> As she saw it, they spoke to her, and it says, "she turned backward".<a name=389:20></a> One of the greatest features of spirituality is instinct; so here it is as if instinctively she turned backward, for Jesus was not there.<a name=389:21></a> Angels were there; but it was to call attention to the dignity of the Person who had been there.<a name=389:22></a> She looked backward

		J.T.<a name=392:3></a> Our subject is really the relation of the ministry to the minister, and the relation of the minister to the ministry.<a name=392:4></a> This epistle interweaves those two thoughts in an exceptional way, that is, the personality or character of the minister as bearing on the ministry, and vice versa, the bearing of the ministry upon the minister himself; much was said, too, about personality hinging on sonship, whether in Christ or in us.<a name=392:5></a> We can understand that in coming in, God would come in relation to personality, that is in the Son, so that it is God who is brought to us, but in One great enough to represent Him.<a name=392:6></a> The evangelists introduce the Lord in that way, as greeted from heaven by the Father, "<i>Thou</i> art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight", (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#1:11">Mark  1:11</a>, Luke 3:22) and also, "<i>This</i> is my beloved Son" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#3:17">Matthew  3:17</a>), the one referring to His own consciousness of the Father's pleasure in Him and the other, the attention of others being called to Him by the Father.<a name=392:7></a> On the mount of transfiguration it is, "<i>This</i> is my beloved Son: hear him", (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#9:7">Mark  9:7</a>, Luke 9:35) The same principle runs down to all ministers; as sons there is that consciousness of our relation with God and His pleasure in us; and then in <i>some way</i> God calls attention to us, so that we may be listened to.<a name=392:8></a> Hence Paul is "an elect vessel to me", the Lord says, "to bear my name before both nations and kings and the sons of Israel", (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:15">Acts  9:15</a>).<a name=392:9></a>

		I have in mind to speak of <i>transparency</i>, a subject which is emphasised in the book of Revelation.<a name=435:1></a> You will have seen that in the four scriptures read in Revelation this idea is presented.<a name=435:2></a> The <i>shining</i> of the city is clear as crystal, like jasper stone; the <i>city itself</i> is pure gold like pure glass; the <i>street</i> of it is pure gold as transparent glass; the <i>river</i> that issues from the throne is bright as crystal.<a name=435:3></a> Transparency appears in each of these features, indicating to us what God is about to end up with, and how transparent everything will be in the coming world.<a name=435:4></a> But what is thus to shine is being formed now; each of us as believers is to have part in it.<a name=435:5></a> There will be no formation then, as far as I apprehend; all that is God's present work.<a name=435:6></a>

		Now this is an important matter, and what suggests itself to my mind in the Old Testament is that which appeared to Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu and seventy of the elders of Israel as they ascended to the mount to meet God.<a name=435:7></a> A wonderful privilege was opened up to them; and, as ever, God gives abundant testimony as to what He would have us know.<a name=435:8></a> This incident proves it when there were seventy of the elders beside Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, called up.<a name=435:9></a> It says, "They saw the God of Israel; and there was under his feet as it were work of transparent sapphire" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#24:10">Exodus  24:10</a>), God thus indicating at that early date how things are to be transparent, and that that which was under His feet was thus marked.<a name=435:10></a> He had walked earlier, and He was about to walk again, as He says later, "in a tent and in a tabernacle" (<a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#7:6">2 Samuel  7:6</a>) with His people.<a name=435:11></a> He

		And so, as Israel is to go out of Egypt into Canaan, He is to walk with them, but before He does this He calls up abundant witnesses who, as it says, "saw the God of Israel; and there was under his feet as it were work of transparent sapphire", (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#24:10">Exodus  24:10</a>).<a name=437:4></a> These are the divine circumstances; we shall see in due course the answer to all this in the heavenly city.<a name=437:5></a> Already all these features are being worked out, for God is dwelling among His people and walking among them, so that we might learn something of Him, of His manner, of His ways, the manner of His dwelling, and the manner of His walking.<a name=437:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to show you from these passages in the gospels how this principle of transparency is worked out in each one of us.<a name=437:7></a> I say in each one, because that city is composed of the saints of this dispensation; myriads of the redeemed -- and not only redeemed, but each by himself the handiwork of God.<a name=437:8></a> And so the record in Mark as to this palsied man is intended to show how the believer <i>begins</i> with the principle of transparency.<a name=437:9></a> It is said that the man was "borne of four", meaning that his condition had elicited sympathy, and that the ability to sympathise had been extended.<a name=437:10></a> In the ministry of Christ the atmosphere became impregnated with the spirit of compassion.<a name=437:11></a> Mark presents to us such a personality in Christ ("Jesus Christ, Son of God") in the service, that the influence extended, and an evangelical spirit sprang up, so that the state of the man drew out the sympathy of four -- which suggests <i>general</i> sympathy.<a name=437:12></a> You do not get that in John.<a name=437:13></a> John contemplates a different state of things; he presents us with a man who for thirty-eight years lay by a pool, nobody undertaking to help him; whereas the wonderful servant that Mark presents,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=438>[Page 438]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the wonderful personality that was there, created an atmosphere of sympathy, an evangelical state of things, so that the man is borne of four and the roof is dug through.<a name=438:1></a> But what I want to point out particularly is that the <i>bed</i> on which he lay comes down.<a name=438:2></a> You say, 'The <i>man</i> came down', but the scripture says here, "the bed on which the sick of the palsy lay" came down.<a name=438:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this is a very elementary side, but most important.<a name=438:4></a> If we are to begin with transparency, the <i>whole position</i> has to be brought into view.<a name=438:5></a> It is not simply that the Lord is told about the man.<a name=438:6></a> It is not like the case of the centurion's servant, for the Lord never saw that servant as far as the scripture shows; it was a question of the power of His <i>word</i>.<a name=438:7></a> But here we have a different thing entirely, a matter which every believer, every exercised person before God, should take notice of, that all the circumstances in which the man rests are brought down.<a name=438:8></a> You can see the roof opening, you can see the light coming through, and here is this thing, this bed -- the <i>bed</i> whereon he lay.<a name=438:9></a> We are very likely to hide the beds; they are indeed private things generally: but if they represent my secret circumstances, if they represent my secret relations, my secret affiliations, it is of all importance that the bed of each of us should come into view.<a name=438:10></a> It came down before the Lord; did He not see it?<a name=438:11></a> Thus it is that all that man's circumstances came into the view of the Lord and of others too.<a name=438:12></a>

		Blessing is present in Christ for him, but it says, "when Jesus saw their faith"; their faith lay in this, that they would get him into the presence of the Lord.<a name=438:13></a> But was it an accident that they could not bring him in through the door?<a name=438:14></a> Not at all; it was necessary that he should come in through the roof, that the whole circumstances should be seen -- that bed, the bed whereon he lay, he was on it, so that

		These four had done their work, but look at what is in Christ for the man!<a name=439:10></a> Those present insinuated that He spoke blasphemies; how could He forgive sins?<a name=439:11></a> But "the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins".<a name=439:12></a> He says, "Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?<a name=439:13></a>" and so He says to the man, "I say unto <i>thee</i>, Arise, and take up thy bed".<a name=439:14></a> To <i>thee</i> I say, Take up thy bed.<a name=439:15></a> He is occupied with that man, with the "child"; he is to be in the city by and by, he is to reflect Christ there.<a name=439:16></a> He is not to be an opaque element; his shining is to be clear as crystal, like a jasper, and this is where it begins.<a name=439:17></a> Is it not worth while to begin thus?<a name=439:18></a> Or will it pay to go on with these secret things, these secret worldly things that are eating the very vitals out of your soul?<a name=439:19></a> Bring them all out and let them be known, and the brethren will help you; the Lord will help you through them.<a name=439:20></a>

		From chapter 11 to 20 you have the forming of a spiritual family; Mary of Bethany represents that formation, one who, as we saw last night, learned to measure, and to have the best, so as to expend it on Christ.<a name=443:3></a> I cannot be in the heavenly city save as formed and instructed in this way, as understanding measure and what is most excellent in quality.<a name=443:4></a> The component parts of the city are spiritually intelligent beings, and Mary represents such.<a name=443:5></a> She understood measurement; she had a pound of ointment, and it was the best.<a name=443:6></a> That is what spirituality signifies; it goes in for the best there is; and she had that.<a name=443:7></a> It was not a question of the quantity.<a name=443:8></a> We are living in an age of quantity.<a name=443:9></a> It is wonderful the quantity there is of things, of money, commerce, religion, education.<a name=443:10></a> Today it is the vastness of the scale on which things are carried on.<a name=443:11></a> It is a question of volume, and men become inflated according to their volume, whereas with God it is a question, not of volume, but of quality.<a name=443:12></a>

		If you look at the material universe, you get volume.<a name=443:13></a> Think of the volume that there is in the <i>worlds</i>!<a name=443:14></a> The Holy Spirit uses that word, not only world, not only the universe that we are accustomed to, but <i>worlds</i> -- think of the volume!<a name=443:15></a> It is beyond us.<a name=443:16></a> If it is a question of volume, why there it is; as God says, The cattle upon a thousand hills are Mine (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#50:10">Psalm  50:10</a>).<a name=443:17></a> But it is no question now of volume with God, but of <i>quality</i>, and that is spirituality.<a name=443:18></a> Mary understood that, and she kept a pound (a measured amount), and the odour of it, we are told, filled the house; and so, from that point in the gospel of John you have the bringing in and forming of a spiritual family, represented in Mary Magdalene.<a name=443:19></a>

		Now you can understand that we can have the very best things in Mary and in those whom she communicated to.<a name=446:17></a> They are the handiwork of Christ, the best that the earth ever had upon it, as the Lord said, "The saints that are on the earth, and to the excellent thou hast said in them is all my delight", (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16:3">Psalm  16:3</a>).<a name=446:18></a> They were that; not now merely the excellent of the earth, may I not say, beloved, they were the excellent of <i>heaven</i>?<a name=446:19></a> That is indeed what we are, far beyond any thing on earth -- the excellent of heaven.<a name=446:20></a> Hence it says, "As we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly", (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:49">1 Corinthians  15:49</a>); so that we, the excellent of heaven, await our house which is from heaven.<a name=446:21></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=469:1></a> I thought we might look at the intervening chapters -- first chapter 7, in which the apostle urges his reception among the Corinthians, advancing in a humble and touching manner the grounds for the resumption of happy relations between them and himself.<a name=469:2></a> His first letter had grieved them to repentance, and he would have them know that in writing he was thinking not so much of the injured or the one who injured, but that his diligent zeal for them might be manifest before God.<a name=469:3></a> He did also think of the incestuous person who had been dealt with by them at Corinth with a view to his spirit being saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.<a name=469:4></a> Now the apostle is concerned that he should be restored, in other words, concerned about the work of God.<a name=469:5></a> The man, on account of his history, was under great pressure, as we see in chapter 2; but then he was to be reinstated as available in the fellowship.<a name=469:6></a> The true servant thus shows his concern for the work of God; discipline had the man's salvation in view.<a name=469:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we have the subject of the collection, into which the apostle enters most heartily and lengthily, even taking part in the service to the extent of being a deacon, reminding us that the spirit of service renders us ready to take on any necessary work, any work that may tend to promote the interests of the Lord.<a name=469:8></a> Now he exalts the subject, as we might expect, to the level on which he was operating, viewing those who serve in it as Christ's glory.<a name=469:9></a> The assembly is brought into the service of giving in a striking manner, its messengers being the glory of Christ.<a name=469:10></a> We are reminded that what apparently would be material, and thus relatively insignificant,

		is to be put on the exalted basis on which the service of God is.<a name=470:1></a> The collection is not beneath that; it is the bounty of the saints.<a name=470:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.H.<a name=470:3></a> There has been a good bit of exercise about the collection.<a name=470:4></a> Some think the box ought not to be on the table.<a name=470:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=470:6></a> The suggestion in that is that it is beneath the dignity of what is on the table; that is, the <i>love</i> behind the giving is overlooked, whereas it is spiritually pure gold.<a name=470:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=470:8></a> I suppose it is entitled to a place as a sacrificial offering, an odour of a sweet-smelling savour.<a name=470:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=470:10></a> It is brought on to that distinctive level here in its results -- at the end of chapter 9.<a name=470:11></a> "Now he that supplies seed to the sower and bread for eating shall supply and make abundant your sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness: enriched in every way unto all free-hearted liberality, which works through us thanksgiving to God.<a name=470:12></a> Because the ministration of this service is not only filling up the measure of what is lacking to the saints, but also abounding by many thanksgivings to God; they glorifying God through the proof of this ministration, by reason of your subjection, by profession, to the glad tidings of the Christ, and your free-hearted liberality in communicating towards them and towards all; and in their supplication for you, full of ardent desire for you, on account of the exceeding grace of God which is upon you.<a name=470:13></a> Thanks be to God for his unspeakable free gift", (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#9:10">2 Corinthians  9:10</a> - 15).<a name=470:14></a> There can be no doubt in the light of those words as to the spiritual significance of giving.<a name=470:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=470:16></a> So you suggest that the collection reaches up to the level of what we have had before us here, and takes its place commensurately with it.<a name=470:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=470:18></a> Yes.<a name=470:19></a> It is on that plane, and it ought to appeal to us that the messengers of the assembly to minister to the need in Jerusalem were Christ's

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=471:18></a> It is very remarkable as the testimony extended to Antioch that a prophetic ministry came down from Judaea -- as if that was Judaea's contribution (compare <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#15:27">Romans  15:27</a>) at that moment -- announcing that there would be a great dearth, which took place under Claudius.<a name=471:19></a> That was God's governmental action in view of what was proceeding at Antioch.<a name=471:20></a> The dearth took place in the days of Claudius, and that brought into view the need in Judaea, which certain who were "well off" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#11:29">Acts  11:29</a>) at Antioch were determined to meet; and it says they did it,

		and sent it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.<a name=472:1></a> God acted governmentally in the dearth to bring out the bounty of the gentiles, and thus increase the links between the brethren in Judaea and those at Antioch -- a very remarkable illustration of what you say.<a name=472:2></a> The appeal there was to those who were "well off"; that has its own voice.<a name=472:3></a> Here it is not to such specially, but to the assembly, the saints as a whole; we should not therefore leave the thing to those who have means, for a man is accepted according to what he has, however little it may be or however much.<a name=472:4></a> It is in the acceptance that the gain is; it is in being accepted that one gains spiritually.<a name=472:5></a>

		M.W.<a name=472:6></a>B.<a name=472:7></a> Is it not important to see that the collection is an assembly act?<a name=472:8></a> It is the act of the church as you have pointed out, sent through the messengers of the assemblies, and then in Philippians it says, "No assembly communicated anything to me in the way of giving and receiving, save ye alone".<a name=472:9></a> It is not merely an individual action, but the action of the assembly.<a name=472:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=472:11></a> That is the point of view in these two epistles.<a name=472:12></a> In the first epistle the collection is brought in in relation to the first day of the week, which is very noteworthy.<a name=472:13></a> The breaking of bread is not even brought in in that connection in Corinthians.<a name=472:14></a> The Lord's supper is dwelt upon without any mention of the day on which it was celebrated.<a name=472:15></a> But the day is mentioned in regard of the collection, as if it were a tangible way of reminding them of spirituality; that they could show it in that, laying by at home on the first day of the week as God prospered them.<a name=472:16></a> The mention of the first day of the week would carry a certain spiritual sentiment with it, which undoubtedly they would be capable of appreciating, and that sentiment is connected with the collection and not with the Lord's supper in the first epistle.<a name=472:17></a>

		J.T.<a name=475:8></a> It springs from these.<a name=475:9></a> The spirit of blessing would arise from God giving -- what God is to us; so that the cup, being the cup of <i>blessing</i>, should induce that spirit in us.<a name=475:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=475:15></a> But then the need is not simply in your own locality.<a name=475:16></a> The need would be general.<a name=475:17></a> If we love the Lord, we are interested in what is general in the assembly at large; so you would get to know the current needs everywhere, and would think in that connection.<a name=475:18></a> Do you not think so?<a name=475:19></a>

		H.D'A.<a name=475:20></a>C.<a name=475:21></a> I understand that a hundred years ago, when the movement of recovery began, there was an immense amount of giving without knowing the need, but that led to abundance for those who were gifts, and great enlargement in the gospel.<a name=475:22></a>

		J.T.<a name=475:23></a> But what I am alluding to in this is in most gatherings; as far as I know, there is no definite thought at all as to what is needed.<a name=475:24></a> If there is anything over, well and good, but if there is not, there is nothing to give.<a name=475:25></a> But that is not the way God gives.<a name=475:26></a> God measures the need, and He would have us to
