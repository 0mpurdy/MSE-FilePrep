		The brethren, I am sure, will perceive the applicability of this passage to our present circumstances; indeed, nothing is more characteristic of Scripture than its way of taking account of human circumstances, especially circumstances causing grief among God's people.<a name=1:1></a> The Scriptures themselves afford comfort, for the "comfort of the scriptures" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#15:4">Romans  15:4</a>) is spoken of, and there is comfort at the present time in the passage I read; and help, too, as one hopes, particularly for those most affected.<a name=1:2></a> They are in our minds, knowing that they need comfort.<a name=1:3></a> The Scriptures will not fail in this respect, nor will the brethren fail.<a name=1:4></a> There will be comfort from the Scriptures and from the brethren.<a name=1:5></a> Indeed, the Spirit is here for comfort and to help us in our efforts to serve each other at such a time.<a name=1:6></a> We have the Lord above touched with the feelings of our infirmities, and the Spirit here who makes intercession with groanings that cannot be uttered.<a name=1:7></a> These are operative in the saints, and so this passage enters into the moment, and, in order that it should be qualified, other passages may be introduced.<a name=1:8></a>

		Our brother has mentioned in prayer one that is appropriate at the moment: a mother bereaved by the death of an only child.<a name=1:9></a> It is a touching scripture involving one specially affected; it was the Shunammite mentioned in <a href="../bible/2Kings.htm#4">2 Kings  4</a>.<a name=1:10></a> She had the experience of being bereft of her only child, a son divinely given according to promise; and she knew what to do.<a name=1:11></a> That is what is in mind in reading this scripture, that we all might know how to take this solemn situation, and particularly those immediately

		affected; that they should know how to take the sorrow.<a name=2:1></a> We are to be taught in these circumstances so as to know how to think and what to do.<a name=2:2></a> The Shunammite would go to the man of God.<a name=2:3></a> She knew where to go -- a most important matter.<a name=2:4></a> Our beloved brother and sister, the parents of this dear child who is now lying here dead, undoubtedly have already learned where to go, and have gone there; and as having gone, they will know how to be here at this moment.<a name=2:5></a> The Shunammite knew.<a name=2:6></a> She knew that all nature was to be barred, and so placed the child on Elisha's bed.<a name=2:7></a> She went to the man of God, and he understood there was deep concern in her heart.<a name=2:8></a> We can indeed be thankful for a man of God.<a name=2:9></a> Elisha is also a type of Christ, and <i>He</i> knows.<a name=2:10></a> He knows what is going on in the hearts of the bereaved.<a name=2:11></a> Elisha discerned that the Shunammite was deeply moved -- perhaps too deeply affected to make visible expression of it, for there is sorrow that is incapable of visible expression.<a name=2:12></a> We know how it applies to the Lord.<a name=2:13></a> He sorrowed alone on the cross, and thus He knows what sorrow is.<a name=2:14></a> He knows what bereavement is, too, and enters into it with the bereaved ones.<a name=2:15></a> So the prophet directs his servant to ask her, "Is it well with thee?<a name=2:16></a> is it well with thy husband?<a name=2:17></a> is it well with the child?<a name=2:18></a> And she said, It is well" (<a href="../bible/2Kings.htm#4:26">2 Kings  4:26</a>).<a name=2:19></a> That is an answer that has to be studied.<a name=2:20></a> The Holy Spirit helps us to do this.<a name=2:21></a> The woman kept her thoughts on the man of God.<a name=2:22></a> So there is need for the bereaved ones here to keep their thoughts where they should be -- on our High Priest above.<a name=2:23></a> The Shunammite's thoughts were on Elisha.<a name=2:24></a> She had gone a long way for him and would have him go back with her.<a name=2:25></a> If the child was to be raised, he must be where he is.<a name=2:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the passage read, it is a solemn fact that the child is <i>not</i> raised.<a name=2:27></a> The word 'dead' is mentioned about eight times, and not without purpose.<a name=2:28></a> In

		other similar circumstances, we have the resurrection of the person involved.<a name=3:1></a> The child of the Shunammite was to be raised <i>immediately</i>.<a name=3:2></a> That was in the purpose of God.<a name=3:3></a> The daughter of Jairus was to be raised.<a name=3:4></a> The Lord went all the way to raise her at the urgent request of her father.<a name=3:5></a> The young man at the gate of Nain was raised.<a name=3:6></a> These instances are recorded, all culminating in the desired end; but not in David's case.<a name=3:7></a> So it is solemn, and I read it because it affords instruction, particularly for those directly affected.<a name=3:8></a> They need instruction, and they need comfort, and they need to know what to do, and maybe they need to change their attitude.<a name=3:9></a> Possibly many of us have not had this idea of change of attitude in such circumstances.<a name=3:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a question for us as to what really commands us at such a time -- how far nature has sway or how far the Spirit of God has sway, and so David, we are told, besought God for the child, Will he live?<a name=3:11></a> But he not only besought God for the child; he fasted and went in and lay all night upon the earth.<a name=3:12></a> "And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him up from the earth; but he would not, and he ate no bread with them" -- a suitable attitude in a most solemn time.<a name=3:13></a> He is a feeling man, and he had good reason to feel, and he felt rightly; his attitude was perfect.<a name=3:14></a> His lying on the earth was perfect while the child lived.<a name=3:15></a> "And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept; for I thought, Who knows?<a name=3:16></a> perhaps Jehovah will be gracious to me, that the child may live".<a name=3:17></a> He reasoned rightly, as a man of God would.<a name=3:18></a> He knew what to do, and he knew how to feel, and God honoured him.<a name=3:19></a> God took account of him.<a name=3:20></a> Heaven was looking on, as now, for these occasions are not simply to exercise men; they are occasions for heaven.<a name=3:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Heaven is looking on the bereaved -- the <i>living</i>.<a name=3:22></a> We are all of interest to heaven, but especially the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		bereaved -- how they have been, how they are now, and how they are going to be in regard to all this.<a name=4:1></a> David is perfect up to this point in his attitude, and he explains his attitude.<a name=4:2></a> He says, "While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept; for I thought, Who knows?<a name=4:3></a> perhaps Jehovah will be gracious to me" -- not to the child, but to <i>me</i>.<a name=4:4></a> At least, that was the great thought, that the child should live.<a name=4:5></a> He knew what it involved to be deprived of the child, but he knew God.<a name=4:6></a> That is the point -- how far our knowledge of God will stand by us at such a time, for we are dealing with <i>Him</i>.<a name=4:7></a> So David says, "Who knows?<a name=4:8></a> perhaps Jehovah will be gracious to me, that the child may live".<a name=4:9></a> But later he says, "Now he is dead".<a name=4:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that is the solemn fact that always comes up in these cases, as it has come up even at this very moment.<a name=4:11></a> Our dear ones are taken away, and not only have they fallen asleep in Jesus, but we have as at this moment to say, She is dead; the child is dead.<a name=4:12></a> It is a solemn fact for the parents; it was a more solemn fact for David.<a name=4:13></a> The word 'dead' is used, as I said, many times in the passage.<a name=4:14></a> Is not the Spirit of God stressing it through this scripture -- the reality of death?<a name=4:15></a> But then there is no penalty.<a name=4:16></a> "Their angels in the heavens continually behold the face of my Father who is in the heavens" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:10">Matthew  18:10</a>).<a name=4:17></a> The Lord Jesus Himself furnishes us with this fact; so, as understanding it, we can leave her.<a name=4:18></a> It is well for the child, indeed.<a name=4:19></a> We can all say that without any question.<a name=4:20></a> It runs through the Scriptures.<a name=4:21></a> No doubt many of us can say it feelingly as to the loved ones of each of us who have fallen asleep, that it is well with them.<a name=4:22></a> Let us rest in it, therefore.<a name=4:23></a> So David says here, "But now he is dead".<a name=4:24></a> We have come to this solemn fact.<a name=4:25></a> There is going to be no resurrection now, no immediate relief in that sense.<a name=4:26></a> There was in relation to the daughter of Jairus; there was in relation to Lazarus -- there was peculiar

	<div class="paragraph">
		relief for his sisters; there was for the mother of the young man of Nain; there was in relation to the Shunammite's son.<a name=5:1></a> The prophet sends for the mother of the child and delivered to her her son, and she went away -- profoundly affected.<a name=5:2></a> But there is no such possibility now.<a name=5:3></a> Intelligence teaches us that resurrection must be awaited.<a name=5:4></a> There are to be more needed results, results in the parents and the grandparents, in all of us -- more important immediately than the actual resurrection of the dear child.<a name=5:5></a> Her time is coming.<a name=5:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The resurrection is a great future event, a certain future event.<a name=5:7></a> That is the hope of our hearts; that there is to be a resurrection of the dead.<a name=5:8></a> The Lord speaks of it: "But that the dead rise, even Moses shewed in the section of the bush, when he called the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob; but he is not God of the dead but of the living; for all live for him" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#20:37">Luke  20:37</a>,38).<a name=5:9></a> They are with God; they are in His keeping.<a name=5:10></a> As to their bodies, they are in Machpelah, so to speak.<a name=5:11></a> It is all a question of time as to that.<a name=5:12></a> The event is certain; and so David says here, "But now he is dead, why should I fast?<a name=5:13></a> Can I bring him back again?<a name=5:14></a>" Beautiful intelligence and beautiful resignation!<a name=5:15></a> It is a lesson for us all.<a name=5:16></a> We are to know how to feel and act at such a time, bringing God into it.<a name=5:17></a> So he goes on to say, "I shall go to him, but he will not return to me"; that is to say, the Spirit of God is telling us in this passage to face realities, the realities that are visible to us.<a name=5:18></a> David shows by his attitude that he was a victorious man as seen in this passage.<a name=5:19></a> It is said in verse 20, "Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his clothing, and entered into the house of Jehovah and worshipped".<a name=5:20></a> Is this not the desired result?<a name=5:21></a> Is this not the state we are to be in?<a name=5:22></a> Is it well with the child?<a name=5:23></a> Better for her than ever it could be here.<a name=5:24></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This is a terrible world in which to bring up children.<a name=6:1></a> Even for this reason we can say, It is well with the child.<a name=6:2></a> There may be circumstances, of course, that we have to leave with those who have to go through them, but it is well with the child.<a name=6:3></a> There is no thought of change at all with David; it is a fixed matter.<a name=6:4></a> Let us accept this, that what God does is done with accuracy, with purpose, and above all, with love behind it.<a name=6:5></a> It is done; it is a finished incident governed by divine love.<a name=6:6></a> We are all on the way, as the child was.<a name=6:7></a> She has gone to the end; not now to the resurrection.<a name=6:8></a> She is awaiting it as we are.<a name=6:9></a> However long it will be for her, it will be for us.<a name=6:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But David is not now weeping and mourning.<a name=6:11></a> Why should he, if things are well as according to the will of God?<a name=6:12></a> For it is a fixed matter with God that the child is not to return, and faith sees that it is a fixed matter -- "I shall go to him, but he will not return to me".<a name=6:13></a> That is the suitable attitude of mind.<a name=6:14></a> We must accept the fixedness of it, which is God's will; and so it is said, "he changed his apparel"; that is, he is not a mourner.<a name=6:15></a> Not that I am saying a word about the grief in the hearts of the parents -- not at all.<a name=6:16></a> But why should we deny God His rights?<a name=6:17></a> How do we wish to appear before God?<a name=6:18></a> If we put on mourning, it is not for God's eye.<a name=6:19></a> God is not looking for that.<a name=6:20></a> David, it is said, "changed his apparel".<a name=6:21></a> It had been perhaps mourning, but not now.<a name=6:22></a> It is a question of God now.<a name=6:23></a> These incidents occasion great history.<a name=6:24></a> They are great matters in the history of the persons immediately involved; great matters for all of us.<a name=6:25></a> They are education spiritually.<a name=6:26></a> We should all learn by them.<a name=6:27></a> "He changed his apparel".<a name=6:28></a> We are not going to make any show before men unnecessarily.<a name=6:29></a> There may be certain seemliness in mourning, but we have to think of God and what kind of garments He looks for, and what kind of garments are suitable for persons who accept His

		It is not so much to tell us about the child and the antecedents, but the remarkableness in David, a great saint, in facing such a matter, and knowing what attitude to take up, and how to behave afterwards.<a name=7:6></a> He is going to be a worshipper of God.<a name=7:7></a> With the child, it is well.<a name=7:8></a> David is not going further into this matter.<a name=7:9></a> He says, I shall go to him; he is not coming back to me.<a name=7:10></a> He had many a sorrow in his house afterwards -- terrible ones followed -- but this was peculiarly poignant.<a name=7:11></a> In the meanwhile, David is not to be a mourner or useless in the service of God, but rather a worshipper, a priest as well as king.<a name=7:12></a> I believe his whole outlook was changed.<a name=7:13></a> The sorrow had been of immense importance in his history.<a name=7:14></a> He became a worshipper perhaps as he had never been before.<a name=7:15></a> He has an insight into the future, into the realm, too, of the living.<a name=7:16></a>

		J.T.<a name=9:10></a> He made certain overtures carrying premiums in chapter 19:2 - 6: "And they .<a name=9:11></a>.<a name=9:12></a>.<a name=9:13></a> encamped in the wilderness; and Israel encamped there before the mountain.<a name=9:14></a> And Moses went up to God, and Jehovah called to him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel: Ye have seen what I have done to the Egyptians, and how I have borne you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself.<a name=9:15></a> And now, if ye will hearken to my voice indeed and keep my covenant, then shall ye be my own possession out of all the peoples -- for all the earth is mine -- and ye shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation".<a name=9:16></a> Indeed, this is the overture that God made, and the remaining part of chapter 19 is what the apostle alludes to in Hebrews as causing trembling and fear, as if God would, before He comes to chapter 20, give people to understand that He was God, and they were the people, and that He was to be feared.<a name=9:17></a> The chapter is all preliminary in view of what is in mind, the setting up of the tabernacle, in which everything would be requisite for their drawing near in type, but this proposal comes in in chapter 20, showing that God is severe and reminds us that He is God and we are His people, and we have to learn to

		Well, that is what characterises the end of chapter 19 after God comes out.<a name=10:6></a> It says in verse 16, "And it came to pass on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings and a heavy cloud on the mountain, and the sound of the trumpet exceeding loud; and the whole people that was in the camp trembled.<a name=10:7></a> And Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the foot of the mountain.<a name=10:8></a> And the whole of mount Sinai smoked, because Jehovah descended on it in fire; and its smoke ascended as the smoke of a furnace; and the whole mountain shook greatly.<a name=10:9></a> And the sound of the trumpet increased and became exceeding loud" (verses 16 - 19).<a name=10:10></a> All this is to impress us now that we are having to do with God.<a name=10:11></a> "God is greatly to be feared in the council of the saints" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#89:7">Psalm  89:7</a>).<a name=10:12></a> It is not that His affections are not ever ready to show themselves, but He would impress us with the need of reverence, especially young people, that they are in the presence of God, not in fleshly feelings but reverential feelings.<a name=10:13></a> Chapter 20 follows.<a name=10:14></a> In chapter 19 it formally states His rights in ten words, making His demands on us.<a name=10:15></a> Then it is said

		These scriptures are intimately related, so that I hope I shall not find any difficulty in linking them in the ministry of the truth.<a name=33:1></a> They speak of things being <i>kept</i> -- spiritual things.<a name=33:2></a> The basis is laid in them, I think, for the existence of Christianity without the written page.<a name=33:3></a> In eternity, we shall not be referring to the written page.<a name=33:4></a> Whatever there will be, it will not be kept in storehouses but in the intelligences and affections of persons, and this fact obviously suggests great richness in that day, and great variety and great freshness.<a name=33:5></a> It is difficult to place ourselves in a timeless state of things, because we are accustomed to time.<a name=33:6></a> We could hardly think save as in time, but God would help us to participate in a limitless state of things, and that we should be accustomed to variety -- never idle or disinterested; never, as it were, looking out of the window.<a name=33:7></a> And these scriptures lay the basis for power to keep things -- things that are worth keeping.<a name=33:8></a> The first three scriptures read speak of things directly connected with the Lord Jesus: first, in His babehood; the second, in His boyhood and the third, in His young manhood.<a name=33:9></a> They involve, therefore, grounding in the knowledge of Christ; that we acquire a knowledge of Him that remains with us.<a name=33:10></a> Much indeed, is forgotten, one knows, even of the best things, but the Scriptures would suggest, especially in these passages, the need of discrimination in what comes to us, and to hold certain features, as Mary would keep certain things in her mind; the word 'mind' being suggestive of the place where these things are kept in the organism of a person.<a name=33:11></a> And then you ponder them in the heart,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These two verses of chapter 3 are to be taken in relation to the babyhood of Christ, the condescension of the Person, and then there is growth; He grew, we are told, in wisdom and stature.<a name=51:3></a> His baptism is noted and He is praying in relation to it.<a name=51:4></a> It is said that "The heaven was opened, and the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form as a dove upon him; and a voice came out of heaven, <i>Thou</i> art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight".<a name=51:5></a> We do not get that in relation to the babyhood of Christ, nor even the boyhood, but the manhood.<a name=51:6></a> God waited for those thirty years to announce this word, but it is in keeping with what is down here, that is, the Lord's own movements -- having been baptised and praying, as it says.<a name=51:7></a> It is a question of what was here according to the divine viewpoint, what came out in the Babe.<a name=51:8></a> The Lord here in a world of evil and about to carry on the service of God is seen praying.<a name=51:9></a> It points to the importance of prayer in relation to the divine scheme.<a name=51:10></a> It brings up the whole question as to 'why' prayer.<a name=51:11></a> This gospel stresses prayer and the intelligent inquiry as to why.<a name=51:12></a> It is linked up both here and in the passage in chapter 9:28,29.<a name=51:13></a> It says, "He went up into a mountain to pray.<a name=51:14></a> And as he prayed the fashion of his countenance became different".<a name=51:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God is signalising this attitude of the Lord's as a Man down here; there is something secret and mysterious as to the power of prayer, and how it glorifies God and brings out this voice; heaven sees it in a Man.<a name=51:16></a> It is part of the constitution, I suppose, that God designed in man, that he was to be an intelligent dependent being.<a name=51:17></a> The law of creation, is there anything in it to correspond?<a name=51:18></a> We have to ponder over Romans 8:19, which says, "For the

		anxious looking out of the creature expects the revelation of the sons of God".<a name=52:1></a> Then we have, "For we know that the whole creation groans together and travails in pain together until now.<a name=52:2></a> And not only that, but even <i>we</i> ourselves .<a name=52:3></a>.<a name=52:4></a>.<a name=52:5></a> groan in ourselves, awaiting adoption, that is the redemption of our body".<a name=52:6></a> And then one other scripture says (verse 26), "In like manner the Spirit joins also its help to our weakness; for we do not know what we should pray for as is fitting, but the Spirit itself makes intercession with groanings which cannot be uttered".<a name=52:7></a> Now it is to bring that out as to whether it is something to be looked into spiritually as to the why and wherefore of prayer and whether heaven descends in principle to the lower creation.<a name=52:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Daniel is an outstanding example of one who prayed in relation to a place on earth.<a name=52:9></a> He is called a man greatly beloved.<a name=52:10></a> Here the Lord is seen by heaven baptised, which would mean intelligent apprehension of what was suitable to God at that time.<a name=52:11></a> And then, being baptised and <i>praying</i>; one is the intelligent acceptance of God's judgment on conditions as they are, and the other is dependence on God in those conditions.<a name=52:12></a>

		Alluding to Elijah, he was a man that was urgent; he put his face between his knees, a remarkable foreshadowing of what is seen here -- the Lord prayed all night; (chapter 6).<a name=52:13></a> Clearly he would be praying for something perfectly known to him that it would happen, whatever it was, whether it brings out the antagonism of what was known to be there.<a name=52:14></a> Paul said, Satan hindered us.<a name=52:15></a> Well, why should that be said?<a name=52:16></a> If God is all-powerful why should Satan hinder?<a name=52:17></a> Is it the want of prayer?<a name=52:18></a> What is prayer, what is the power of it, and the absence of it -- does it mean that Satan has advantage?<a name=52:19></a> Constantly we hear people say, God will overrule, God has ordered it.<a name=52:20></a> But what about the matter of prayer, has it been

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You get God's assurance about a thing; you cannot be happy until you do.<a name=53:3></a> There is too much of this saying, God has ordered or allowed it, and God can prevent or stop it.<a name=53:4></a> But what can I do?<a name=53:5></a> The word is, "faith removes mountains".<a name=53:6></a> It does not say God -- but <i>faith</i> does it (God does the thing, of course).<a name=53:7></a> It shows the power it must have in the universe, it is inscrutable, really, because it is not simply what is said, but it is faith; the prayer of faith shall heal the sick, it is the thing itself.<a name=53:8></a> God does not pray; it is constitutional in the creature, how far it goes down to man or angels is a question, but clearly it is intended to be constitutional in manhood.<a name=53:9></a> There is sometimes an element of fatalism with us; has Satan got some advantage on our side for want of prayer?<a name=53:10></a> The Lord said to Ananias in regard of Saul of Tarsus, Behold he prayeth.<a name=53:11></a> He is constitutionally right, because the Lord says -- not that he is going to pray -- but he is <i>doing</i> it.<a name=53:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think the Lord is just leading the way in these passages for us, first in baptism, which is the acceptance of God's judgment on the conditions that exist.<a name=53:13></a> The judgment would not refer to Jesus, but He is identifying Himself with it as baptized -- and then He is praying.<a name=53:14></a> That is to say, it is the God and man position -- God in covenant.<a name=53:15></a> There is an obligation on the part of man mediatorially as before God that the thing must go through and that it depends upon my prayers, too.<a name=53:16></a> The mediatorial position is always present and we are included in it now as having the Spirit, and it makes you avoid mere glibness in dealing with these matters.<a name=53:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is really a dispensational position that the Lord is inaugurating by example and it is owned in heaven; therefore, it is said the Holy Spirit descended in a

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This mediatorial position is carried forward into chapter 9 which enlarges on the kingdom.<a name=54:5></a> The Lord said (verse 27), "I say unto you of a truth, There are some of those standing here who shall not taste death until they shall have seen the kingdom of God".<a name=54:6></a> That is a direct link with what we have looked at in chapter 3.<a name=54:7></a> And then verse 28, "And it came to pass after these words, about eight days, that taking Peter and John and James he went up into a mountain to pray".<a name=54:8></a> That is what He went up for according to this gospel.<a name=54:9></a> "And as he prayed the fashion of his countenance became different and his raiment white and effulgent.<a name=54:10></a> And lo, two men talked with him".<a name=54:11></a> Now it says that they were Moses and Elias and they spoke about His departure which He was about to accomplish in Jerusalem.<a name=54:12></a> It is the Lord Jesus in direct touch with heaven, and heaven comes out not in angelic form, but in human form.<a name=54:13></a> And as He is praying the fashion of His countenance became different and his raiment white and effulgent.<a name=54:14></a> So that now we have heavenly company come down.<a name=54:15></a> It is not exactly the mount of heaven, but it is very near.<a name=54:16></a> Heaven comes in in known personages in the testimony.<a name=54:17></a> We should become accustomed to heaven's way and this constitutional way in regard to this mediatorial system, because the mediatorial system shall continue after we leave.<a name=54:18></a>

		The subject selected so far in its subdivisions is associated with certain circumstances, the heavenly side appearing to enforce certain other features of the truth.<a name=60:1></a> Yesterday afternoon we looked at chapter 10 following on the scene on the mount; chapter 10 dealing with the service of God.<a name=60:2></a> The Lord selected seventy others besides the apostles and they were successful over the emissaries of the devil.<a name=60:3></a> The Lord introduced the heavenly to balance the experience that the servants had and evidently to influence them in view of further service.<a name=60:4></a> The individual example of the effect of the truth in that section is in Mary at the end of chapter 10, as if the Spirit of God would afford us examples of the truth as we look into it.<a name=60:5></a> Mary, it is said, having sat at the feet of Jesus, was listening to His word.<a name=60:6></a> That is a characteristic feature, an example for us not to be overcome by our own business or household affairs, but to pay attention to what Jesus says first.<a name=60:7></a> Then this individual side develops into the collective position into which this heavenly truth should enter.<a name=60:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		One line of the truth before us is prayer.<a name=62:3></a> The Lord is seen praying after He is baptised; that belongs to the baptised company of persons -- praying.<a name=62:4></a> The disciples observed Him, as the Lord is not presented as praying with them, they are by themselves.<a name=62:5></a> This disciple would have observed the Lord's attitude in His prayer to His Father.<a name=62:6></a> Martha's attack on the Lord and her sister is grouped with the Lord praying in a certain place and how He taught the disciples.<a name=62:7></a> Some members of the household are with the truth and some not; the more talkative are usually not with the truth, there is a divided household.<a name=62:8></a> Mary would be saying, I wish I had more power with my sister.<a name=62:9></a> The Lord said, Martha, Martha.<a name=62:10></a> He announced her name twice, as much as to imply that she was of importance in His mind, and would have her set right.<a name=62:11></a> Luke leaves her not set right; he does not say that she hearkened to the Lord's word.<a name=62:12></a> John brings in the abstract side, that she was a true person at heart; he tells us that she got right about the matter of the resurrection; she confessed the truth.<a name=62:13></a> There is a counter element that is almost invariably to be found in every local meeting.<a name=62:14></a> That element is Martha, she is a sort of responsible one because it is her house.<a name=62:15></a> We learn to save such a situation by thinking of the Father's name first, and then the order of the kingdom.<a name=62:16></a> When ye pray, say, Father.<a name=62:17></a>

		This is a very important matter because the prayer meeting is connected with the house of God, although the house of God is not properly a local thought, there is only one house of God.<a name=63:9></a> There are many assemblies, but only one house; the bearing is universal, the prayer is universal.<a name=63:10></a> There are certain brothers who are habitually silent, which is a very humbling and sorrowful thing, because Luke would say about the young man of Nain as he comes into life spiritually, that he began to speak, as if that was the idea -- priesthood is in prospect.<a name=63:11></a> Why should we not all pray if it is open for us to do so?<a name=63:12></a> This disciple was concerned about all the brethren praying, and not praying, but knowing how to pray.<a name=63:13></a> A brother going about in service never forgets the local position in which he is.<a name=63:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As to Peter's vision, the word 'vessel' is significant and really points to the assembly and each one of us is a vessel.<a name=81:11></a> Paul was a vessel.<a name=81:12></a> "And he became hungry and desired to eat.<a name=81:13></a> But as they were making ready an ecstasy came upon him: and he beholds the heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending, as a great sheet, bound by the four corners and let down to the earth; in which were all the quadrupeds and creeping things of the earth, and the fowls of the heaven.<a name=81:14></a> And there was a voice to him, Rise, Peter, slay and eat.<a name=81:15></a> And Peter said, In no wise, Lord; for I have never eaten anything common or unclean.<a name=81:16></a> And there was a voice again the second time to him, What God has cleansed, do not thou make common.<a name=81:17></a> And this took place thrice, and the vessel was straightway taken up into heaven".<a name=81:18></a>

		now for the heavenly matter.<a name=82:1></a> The sheet, although of woven material, is bound, it is going to hold, it is going back into heaven, to stay there.<a name=82:2></a> What the Lord says to Peter is very striking.<a name=82:3></a> Peter was very definite as to how religious he was, but he was really condemning himself in his remarks.<a name=82:4></a> He says, In no wise, Lord.<a name=82:5></a> He is a very bold man, he is very abrupt in his answer; he is combating heaven.<a name=82:6></a> The thing happening three times succeeds in changing his mind.<a name=82:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In these last days when religious denominations are multiplying the work is harder because every time you have to deal with a soul he has some predilections of earlier experience.<a name=82:8></a> They have in their minds earlier things and they are usually prejudices and they have to overcome them.<a name=82:9></a> We have to be patient in dealing with souls, but we must overcome the prejudices, so that every man must be made perfect in Christ.<a name=82:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to Paul's experience of being caught up to the third heaven and into Paradise, he had kept this matter in his mind for fourteen years, and now he speaks of it.<a name=82:11></a> "I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body I know not, or out of the body I know not, God knows;) such a one caught up to the third heaven.<a name=82:12></a> And I know such a man, (whether in the body or out of the body I know not, God knows;) that he was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable things said which it is not allowed to man to utter.<a name=82:13></a> Of such a one I will boast, but of myself I will not boast, unless in my weaknesses".<a name=82:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then he goes on to tell us how the Lord attended him so that this precious light and experience which he had in Paradise should be preserved and effective in the assembly treasury, for it comes down to us preserved by the Spirit.<a name=82:15></a> The 'making' matter, of course, is still going on, because it is said, "And that

		I might not be exalted by the exceeding greatness of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn for the flesh, a messenger of Satan that he might buffet me, that I might not be exalted.<a name=83:1></a> For this I thrice besought the Lord that it might depart from me.<a name=83:2></a> And he said to me, My grace suffices thee; for my power is perfected in weakness.<a name=83:3></a> Most gladly therefore will I rather boast in my weaknesses, that the power of the Christ may dwell upon me.<a name=83:4></a> Wherefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in insults, in necessities, in persecutions, in straits, for Christ: for when I am weak, then I am powerful".<a name=83:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It would seem that all this is required during the fourteen years since he had been up into Paradise, the making process went on.<a name=83:6></a> It opens up a wide subject as to the treasuries that David speaks of that we have by the Spirit of God, by the temple, in such a person as Mary the Lord's mother who was in the upper room, and in such a person as Paul himself; how things are to be kept in our souls as treasure.<a name=83:7></a> It is said by Luke that Mary the Lord's mother "kept all these things in her mind, pondering them in her heart" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:19">Luke  2:19</a>).<a name=83:8></a> Later we are told that she kept things relative to the Boy Jesus.<a name=83:9></a> As a figure it is said of Jacob that he kept the things that Joseph said as a young man; so that the treasury is to be filled with these things relative to Christ.<a name=83:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But Paul has something relative to Paradise that he has been keeping fourteen years, it is in the treasury.<a name=83:14></a><a name=83:11></a> And so it is, as we are enriched in these matters and carrying them in our hearts we are qualified for our heavenly portion.<a name=83:15></a><a name=83:12></a> When we get there, 'There no stranger-God shall meet thee'.<a name=83:16></a><a name=83:13></a> (<a href=".<a name=83:17></a>.<a name=83:18></a>\hymns\hymns1972.<a name=83:19></a>htm#76:10">Hymn 76</a>) Every servant has his own distinctiveness -- the secret, the name that no one knows but himself.<a name=83:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=85:1></a> I was thinking of the dedication of the wall in Nehemiah, and the dedication of the altar in Numbers.<a name=85:2></a> It will be observed that these scriptures include the important thought of princes in relation to the great things in mind.<a name=85:3></a> The first scripture is a type of the inauguration of the dispensation, and the second is a remnant period, but the princely thought is quite prominent in both.<a name=85:4></a> It is said, "princes shalt thou make them in all the earth" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#45:16">Psalm  45:16</a>), and I thought it would be appropriate to be drawn into the current of this thought, and the main subject, namely the dedication of the altar and the dedication of the wall.<a name=85:5></a> <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#7">Numbers  7</a>contemplates the heavenly system set up, as it is said, "And it came to pass on the day that Moses had completed the setting up of the tabernacle, and had anointed it, and hallowed it, and all the furniture thereof and the altar and all its utensils, and had anointed them, and hallowed them, that the princes of Israel, the heads of their fathers' houses, the princes of the tribes, they that were over them that had been numbered, offered" (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#7:1">Numbers  7:1</a>,2).<a name=85:6></a> Who they are is very plainly stated.<a name=85:7></a> They are active in relation to a heavenly system in the antitype; that is, among ourselves, and one thing to be noted is that each one had his day, according to verse 10: "And the princes presented the dedication-gift of the altar on the day that it was anointed; and the princes presented their offering before the altar".<a name=85:8></a> And in verse 11 it says, "each prince on his day".<a name=85:9></a> So that whilst there are twelve of them, and they act together, for there is one gift and one offering, we may say, yet each one is seen offering, seen acting.<a name=85:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=86:25></a> Yes; things were taking form then, the Holy Spirit having come, confirming what we are saying, that you cannot have Christianity by mere natural, mental attitude or ceremony.<a name=86:26></a> It must involve the Spirit.<a name=86:27></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=126:1></a> It seems as if we should return a little to the first chapter and also enlarge on the second chapter so as to have clearly in our minds what the book is opening up; that is, the first in Vashti and what she represents actively in our times and then the second as to the qualities that show themselves in Esther to bring in the subjective side of the truth which is to be worked out in the truth of the assembly.<a name=126:2></a> We looked a little this morning at the State churches and all that resulted in the history of the four monarchies so the feminine side is seen fully developed in the book of Revelation -- how it comes in for divine judgment.<a name=126:3></a> Its description as given in that book shows how it merits unmitigated divine judgment.<a name=126:4></a> The idea of the feminine in relation to the ruler is seen illustratively, at least, in Nehemiah, who tells us that when he was making supplication to the king to send him to Judaea to build Jerusalem, the queen was sitting by, evidently in sympathy.<a name=126:5></a> The writer of the Psalms (which always open up what is worked out in the Pentateuch) tells of the queen in gold of Ophir sitting on the right of the king (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#45">Psalm  45</a>), showing the divine thought for Israel.<a name=126:6></a> This was reflected in the Babylonish feature of the four monarchies and then in the Persian.<a name=126:7></a> Thus there is the queen mother in relation to Belshazzar -- not the queen sitting by now as with Nehemiah -- but the queen in sympathy with what God is doing at that time, and then in our own times in the Romish empire as linked with Christianity.<a name=126:8></a> It assumes great importance in the four monarchies in that it comes into Christianity and has had to do with Christ as putting Him to death and putting His servants to

		J.T.<a name=128:1></a> Quite so.<a name=128:2></a> There is a group of circumstances that should be observed.<a name=128:3></a> What has been said about Vashti is to make clear in our minds the necessity for the judgment of God and thus the making way for the qualities of Esther.<a name=128:4></a> Then this matter of the second gathering of the virgins in verse 19 seems to allude to some change in the king's attitude.<a name=128:5></a> A second gathering of the virgins -- why should there be that if he had already settled on a queen?<a name=128:6></a> And then is brought in the circumstance of the attempted assassination of the king bringing Mordecai in due time into immense position of advantage.<a name=128:7></a> It would seem as if the matter was settled in regard of Esther as stated in verse 18.<a name=128:8></a> "And the king made a great feast to all his princes and his servants, Esther's feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave presents according to the king's bounty".<a name=128:9></a> The matter seemed to be settled and Esther's position fixed.<a name=128:10></a> Well then, why another gathering of the virgins and why should the attempted assassination of the king be mentioned?<a name=128:11></a> Is it not for further consideration?<a name=128:12></a> Why are other virgins gathered if there is no weakening in the king's affections?<a name=128:13></a> But it is all checked by God by the introduction of the attempted assassination bringing Mordecai under the attention of the king.<a name=128:14></a> God brings this in here to be used later.<a name=128:15></a> In the meantime with this other set of virgins nothing happens and Esther comes through and Mordecai comes through and the mind of God comes through and the fickleness of the king is just left.<a name=128:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.D.<a name=129:29></a> The position of the man and the woman comes out here in Esther and Mordecai.<a name=129:30></a> She is already showing feminine qualities -- Mordecai tells her of the incident and she relates it to the king <i>in Mordecai's name</i>.<a name=129:31></a> She gives the man his place.<a name=129:32></a>

		a second wife in the book of Job.<a name=130:1></a> But here no children are mentioned -- it is the wife in this book.<a name=130:2></a> I think we have seen how Vashti, in type, has worked out in the book of Revelation -- supreme wickedness -- Rome, Babylon -- the smoke of her burning ascends for ever and ever.<a name=130:3></a> So that now the second chapter assumes great importance as bringing in the second.<a name=130:4></a> There are such qualities there.<a name=130:5></a> She was an orphan and Mordecai had brought her up, and thus she gradually comes into her place and shows subjection immediately -- she is content with what is provided for her by Hegai.<a name=130:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=130:11></a> So there is much said in this chapter that needs attention.<a name=130:12></a> It opens up remarkably that in Esther qualities are developed in the presence of Vashti's qualities seen fully blown in Revelation and in power today.<a name=130:13></a> In the time of Constantine already the mystery of iniquity had begun to work and thus in the time of the Reformation we have a number of persons instituting a state church.<a name=130:14></a> And that idea has held in Europe -- it is this great thing called Babylon and stands as representing the feminine side regarding the four monarchies -- especially the fourth monarchy which comes through to the end.<a name=130:15></a> There are other women linked with it; they are called harlots.<a name=130:16></a> Babylon is the mother of harlots -- there are others.<a name=130:17></a> The Anglican system is an apt illustration of a State church.<a name=130:18></a> Even in Scotland and Russia and Greece, all through Europe -- the idea of the State church is held and in the Americas, too, the outgoings of Europe.<a name=130:19></a> It is not so prominent perhaps in the Americas but it exists, the politicians allude to the church -- make room for the church.<a name=130:20></a> It is the woman -- that is the idea.<a name=130:21></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=146:4></a> Well, we spoke on the first chapter at some length to show the principle of the displacement of the first by the second.<a name=146:5></a> The principle is seen in the book of Job but in relation to a family whereas here it is in relation to a king.<a name=146:6></a> Vashti proves herself unfit for the great place of queen and Esther proves herself fit to have it and obtains it.<a name=146:7></a> "And when the turn of Esther the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, came to go in to the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women, appointed.<a name=146:8></a> And Esther obtained grace in the sight of all them that saw her" (<a href="../bible/Esther.htm#2:15">Esther  2:15</a>).<a name=146:9></a> And so she was taken in to the king.<a name=146:10></a> "And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins, and he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.<a name=146:11></a> And the king made a great feast to all his princes and his servants, Esther's feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave presents according to the king's bounty".<a name=146:12></a> Well, we enlarged on chapter 2 in that respect to show how Esther commended herself in a womanly fashion.<a name=146:13></a> It was pointed out the idea of woman's place in relation to man begins in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>and comes down -- it is seen in Abraham's house and Isaac's house and Jacob's house and then Israel had its day -- had its place as the spouse of Jehovah.<a name=146:14></a> And now it is seen in the four monarchies -- the Gentile monarchies which God appointed while hiding His face from the house of Jacob.<a name=146:15></a> And it comes out in a marked way in the

		second monarchy, which is before us, the Persian monarchy.<a name=147:1></a> It comes out in a very evident way so that we cannot but see the inspiration of God in the book -- the setting of the acts as including and involving the principles governing man and woman -- first in relation to Israel and then in relation to the Gentile monarchies and finally in relation to Christ and the assembly.<a name=147:2></a> Now in these two chapters before us, especially the fourth, we see there is correspondence to Christ in suffering.<a name=147:3></a> Esther is called to the position and to the requirements of the position in the sense of suffering.<a name=147:4></a> The enemy coming in as in Haman in chapter 3 forces the crisis and no doubt corresponds to conditions now.<a name=147:5></a> It is a question of whether the brethren are meeting the crisis in the spirit of suffering.<a name=147:6></a>

		J.T.<a name=165:1></a> A question arises in this book which has not been noted so far.<a name=165:2></a> Why should Mordecai be so definite from the outset in refusing to bow to Haman?<a name=165:3></a> As Haman comes into evidence in chapter 3 it is said, "But Mordecai bowed not nor did him reverence".<a name=165:4></a> And Haman notices that himself and is especially filled with fury on that account, we are told.<a name=165:5></a> But in view of the present application we have been making of this book we should see that divine principles, however old they are, do not change, but come down.<a name=165:6></a> Haman was, as we are told, the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite -- Agag undoubtedly representing the Amalekite which Saul should have destroyed and which Samuel did destroy.<a name=165:7></a> He appears here and without any earlier intimation mentioned.<a name=165:8></a> Mordecai refuses to bow to him.<a name=165:9></a> Although he evidently knew that it involved danger, he steadily refuses to bow and thus excites the enemy.<a name=165:10></a> I think it gives us a lead that a divine principle in a crisis, however unapparently connected with the crisis, should be maintained, not overlooked, but maintained.<a name=165:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.D.<a name=165:12></a> Do you think that Mordecai, under God, was honouring the law of <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#17">Exodus  17</a>against the Amalekite?<a name=165:13></a> In the governmental ways of God he comes in with that principle of God and will not bow to Amalek.<a name=165:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=165:15></a> I think that thought would link it with Samuel's day.<a name=165:16></a> When the matter came up with Saul in the destroying of the Amalekites, we have 'words' mentioned.<a name=165:17></a> "And Samuel said to Saul, Jehovah sent <i>me</i> to anoint thee king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken to the voice of the words of Jehovah" (<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#15:1">1 Samuel  15:1</a>).<a name=165:18></a> The 'words' are

	<div class="paragraph">
		details, not mere general principles, but details.<a name=166:1></a> And clearly Mordecai had not forgotten the details.<a name=166:2></a> Saul thought that he had the matter well in hand in a general way in destroying, as he thought, the Amalekites.<a name=166:3></a> But Samuel says to him, "What means then this bleating of sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of oxen which I hear?<a name=166:4></a>" Well, Samuel had in his mind that they were 'words' of Jehovah including all the details regarding this matter.<a name=166:5></a> Whereas Saul thought that generalities would suffice, and allowed natural feelings to enter into the matter and spared Agag.<a name=166:6></a> But in verse 32 we read, "And Samuel said, Bring ye near to me Agag the king of Amalek.<a name=166:7></a> And Agag came to him gaily".<a name=166:8></a> Evidently refined and wealthy.<a name=166:9></a> "And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.<a name=166:10></a> And Samuel said, As thy sword has made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless above women.<a name=166:11></a> And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before Jehovah in Gilgal".<a name=166:12></a> I was thinking, too, of what has been said about <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#17">Exodus  17</a>.<a name=166:13></a> The divine banner has been unfurled against Amalek and is there from generation to generation.<a name=166:14></a> And clearly Mordecai has this in mind.<a name=166:15></a> He had not forgotten.<a name=166:16></a> That is in these circumstances we are not befogged and confused.<a name=166:17></a> Our safety lies in observing divine principles in detail.<a name=166:18></a>

		J.D.<a name=183:1></a> I would like to ask how you regard the apparent heartlessness of this Persian monarch with this man whom he had promoted above all others and with whom he had drunk.<a name=183:2></a> Would it set out that the principles found in man's world, in Satan's world, do not stand, as we have come to now?<a name=183:3></a> And all this makes room for the governmental ways of God in the establishing of His principles.<a name=183:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=183:5></a> That is true, no doubt.<a name=183:6></a> For while the king represents God's authority, it also shows how God uses the fickleness of the person.<a name=183:7></a> God can use anyone.<a name=183:8></a> Even Balaam, one of the worst men, is used to say the greatest things of the people.<a name=183:9></a> And immediately afterwards he teaches Balak to cast a stumbling-block before the children of Israel.<a name=183:10></a> So that while instrumentalities that God uses may represent peculiarly certain things of Christ Himself and God Himself, at the same time they are just men.<a name=183:11></a> This brings out what God <i>can</i> do.<a name=183:12></a> So that I think we see in this man's base fickleness and readiness to turn either to good or evil, what God can do in such circumstances.<a name=183:13></a> And, of course, what rulers were then they are now.<a name=183:14></a> They are fickle and exposed to political influences of every sort.<a name=183:15></a> So that we depend upon God every moment.<a name=183:16></a> There is nothing fixed in this world -- no assurance in their promises.<a name=183:17></a> Whereas with God He is working out His mind -- His government is stable and He would draw us into that stability.<a name=183:18></a> "Now he that establishes us with you in Christ, .<a name=183:19></a>.<a name=183:20></a>.<a name=183:21></a> is God" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#1:21">2 Corinthians  1:21</a>).<a name=183:22></a> There is stability.<a name=183:23></a> He establishes us.<a name=183:24></a> And that is what we may see in these three chapters.<a name=183:25></a> The seventh is important -- dealing with how the king is brought thoroughly into

		the right side of the matter.<a name=184:1></a> So that his wrath rose up -- he was thoroughly aroused, as if representing the wrath of God itself.<a name=184:2></a> Now we have the destruction of Haman.<a name=184:3></a> So it says, "So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai".<a name=184:4></a> That is the end of chapter 7.<a name=184:5></a> And then chapters 8 to 10 are occupied with the feminine in all this -- the establishing of it.<a name=184:6></a> Not exactly much added greatness to Esther but added greatness to Mordecai.<a name=184:7></a> For what God has in mind is Christ, the male side in all this.<a name=184:8></a> Mordecai represents that and there is certain authority with him.<a name=184:9></a> Chapter 10 has only three verses and all about Mordecai.<a name=184:10></a> That is where our minds are left.<a name=184:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.A.<a name=184:12></a> Is there any parallel in this chapter with <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28">Matthew  28</a>where the angel has the stone rolled away and is seen sitting on it?<a name=184:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=184:14></a> Well, there is that.<a name=184:15></a> Satan has been overthrown.<a name=184:16></a> The resurrection of Christ implies that.<a name=184:17></a> So that in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#16:20">Romans  16:20</a> we have, "But the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly".<a name=184:18></a> That means that what was reached through the death of Christ was rapid and quick -- from the divine side the matter is settled, but it takes time to reach it in us -- for it is under our feet.<a name=184:19></a> We have to be ready with our feet to trample on the devil when God gives us the opportunity.<a name=184:20></a> So we have the idea in the third of Genesis -- his head is to be bruised.<a name=184:21></a> We have to be in readiness with our feet for that purpose.<a name=184:22></a> And these chapters show that Mordecai and Esther and the Jews were to be in readiness with their feet to bruise the devil and the wicked one.<a name=184:23></a> Not only Haman but his progeny -- his ten sons.<a name=184:24></a> So in this chapter it is said, "On that day did king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews' oppressor to Esther the queen.<a name=184:25></a> And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was to her.<a name=184:26></a> And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai.<a name=184:27></a> And

		Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman".<a name=185:1></a> So there is the complete displacement of Satan's emissary by Esther and Mordecai.<a name=185:2></a> The king now knows who the queen is.<a name=185:3></a> The family is now brought into evidence, pointing to the day when the Jews will be exalted, taking the place of other elements of opposition.<a name=185:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.D.<a name=185:5></a> What would you say as to Esther and Mordecai being given this place as under Ahasuerus?<a name=185:6></a> Is it the feminine side recognising the male side?<a name=185:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=185:8></a> It is a question of the Jews, someone representing Christ in relation to the Jews.<a name=185:9></a> In the millennium Christ comes out in many relations -- in relation to the assembly -- in relation to the Jews, and in other relations -- King of kings and Lord of lords.<a name=185:10></a> We have this typified in Mordecai.<a name=185:11></a>

		F.R.<a name=185:12></a> The position is consolidated as they go.<a name=185:13></a> They have the house of Haman given to them.<a name=185:14></a> Then Esther proceeds with her concern in relation to her people.<a name=185:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=185:16></a> That is just what is brought out here.<a name=185:17></a> The position is established and then we have a new chapter.<a name=185:18></a> "And Esther spoke yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device which he had devised against the Jews.<a name=185:19></a> And the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther.<a name=185:20></a> And Esther arose and stood before the king, and said, If it please the king and if I have found grace before him, and the thing seem right to the king, and I be pleasing in his sight, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews that are in all the king's provinces.<a name=185:21></a> For how shall I endure to see the evil that shall befall my people?<a name=185:22></a> and how shall I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?<a name=185:23></a> And king Ahasuerus said to queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I

		A.H.<a name=186:8></a> "Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the prince of this world be cast out" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#12:31">John  12:31</a>).<a name=186:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=187:9></a> Very like that.<a name=187:10></a> David is seen there as the prince.<a name=187:11></a> It is a question of personality in Ezekiel -- the full idea of King of kings and Lord of lords.<a name=187:12></a> A prince is surely personality -- the moral greatness of the prince.<a name=187:13></a> So that David is a type.<a name=187:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		C.H.<a name=187:15></a>H.<a name=187:16></a> Before the establishing of that, is the principle with us important as in Timothy -- that of separating from iniquity -- withdrawing from it?<a name=187:17></a> First from Haman as a person and then his devices.<a name=187:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=187:19></a> The awful effects of Haman are here so that we see how Esther is agonising that every trace of Haman and his deeds should be effaced, that there should be a reversal.<a name=187:20></a> So that John tells us that the Lord Jesus came to undo the works of the devil.<a name=187:21></a> Not only the devil himself annulled, but his works annulled in ourselves -- in persons.<a name=187:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		L.E.<a name=187:23></a>S.<a name=187:24></a> So in the preceding chapter Esther refers to Haman as the adversary and the enemy, not Haman the Agagite, as in this chapter.<a name=187:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=187:26></a> Well, that shows that she is in sympathy with Mordecai's determination, seen in refusing to bow to him.<a name=187:27></a> She is brought into that -- a first principle.<a name=187:28></a> It came down from the battle of Rephidim when the conflict began between God and His people, and Satan.<a name=187:29></a> She is now brought into that, Mordecai led her into it.<a name=187:30></a> So she is thoroughly in the thing now.<a name=187:31></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=188:2></a> It brings out that things are not settled by announcement merely, but by their own power.<a name=188:3></a> The Jews are evidently brought into the thing to stand against certain enemies themselves.<a name=188:4></a> It is in mind here that Haman is dead but the fruit of his work remains.<a name=188:5></a> "And king Ahasuerus said to queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he stretched forth his hand against the Jews".<a name=188:6></a> The king is thoroughly with them now.<a name=188:7></a> "Write ye then for the Jews as seems good to you, in the king's name, and seal it with the king's ring".<a name=188:8></a> So the matter is now in their hands.<a name=188:9></a> Well, can they exploit any advantage?<a name=188:10></a> When God gives us an advantage, we are to make the most of it.<a name=188:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=188:15></a> That is true.<a name=188:16></a> He brought himself into a false position -- he went to the Philistines and lost heart.<a name=188:17></a> He said in his heart, "I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul".<a name=188:18></a> That is a poor thing!<a name=188:19></a> God says something in His heart in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#8:21">Genesis  8:21</a>, but it is nothing like that.<a name=188:20></a> God said in His heart, when He smelled the sweet savour from Noah's sacrifice, "I will no more henceforth curse the ground on account of Man, for the thought of Man's heart is evil from his youth".<a name=188:21></a> I just wanted to say a word on exploiting for God, because a moral advantage is given David there, he refused to put Saul to death, but then his heart fails him and he says, I will one day perish by the hand of Saul.<a name=188:22></a> If God gives an advantage as He does today, for all that is happening has the saints in mind, God will develop something

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=292:1></a> Some further remarks are needed to clarify the passages read this forenoon in the New Testament before we proceed to this chapter.<a name=292:2></a> The account in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#9">Luke  9</a>stresses the humanity of Moses and Elias; they were two <i>men</i>, which would be intended to remind us, as to Elijah, that he was not a mythical personage, but a real man, in truth, a heavenly man.<a name=292:3></a> <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#17:10">Matthew  17:10</a> - 13 confirms that he is to come.<a name=292:4></a> The disciples asked, "Why then say the scribes that Elias must first have come?<a name=292:5></a> And he answering said to them, Elias indeed comes first and will restore all things.<a name=292:6></a> But I say unto you that Elias has already come, and they have not known him, but have done unto him whatever they would.<a name=292:7></a> Thus also the Son of man is about to suffer from them.<a name=292:8></a> Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the baptist".<a name=292:9></a> The Lord confirms the Old Testament prophecy as to Elias, who indeed comes first and will restore all things.<a name=292:10></a> So that much of what we may call mystical truth arises in the mind as to Elijah; first, that he is actually now a real man, What his occupation may be we have to leave, just as we have to leave the statement as to the Lord that He is received in heaven pending certain coming events.<a name=292:11></a> Of course it is said that the Lord is at the right hand of God, but that is general; it is not a specific statement as to His position, but a place of great honour and power.<a name=292:12></a> Mark says He "sat" there.<a name=292:13></a> He is operating in relation to the disciples and what they are doing.<a name=292:14></a> But as to what Elias is doing there is nothing said.<a name=292:15></a> He is said here to be a man, and he appeared with Moses talking with Jesus.<a name=292:16></a> It says in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#9:30">Luke  9:30</a>, "And lo, two men talked with him, who were Moses and

		Elias".<a name=293:1></a> It is no question of mere apparition, but actual persons, two men talking with Jesus.<a name=293:2></a> It seems as if there is instruction in this as to the present state of things in heaven.<a name=293:3></a> We spoke this morning of certain who came out of their tombs after the Lord arose, and entered into the holy city and appeared unto many.<a name=293:4></a>

		J.T.<a name=293:10></a> What he is doing now is the mysterious side for us; also where Abraham is according to the Lord's references in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#16">Luke  16</a>; and then what we have as to Moses here, one of the two men; one of them having gone to heaven without dying and the other being concealed by God in burial, Michael contending with the devil about His body.<a name=293:11></a> I am referring to Scripture, the very suggestions of which are food for holy thought.<a name=293:12></a> It is clear the Spirit of God intends that we should be impressed with the fact that they were two men and that they appeared: "And lo, two men talked with him, who were Moses and Elias".<a name=293:13></a> There is no question as to this, it is a fact -- "who were Moses and Elias, who, appearing in glory, spoke of his departure which he was about to accomplish in Jerusalem".<a name=293:14></a> The speaking is all on their side, they were two men talking with Jesus.<a name=293:15></a> It goes on to say they appeared in glory, and we are told what they were speaking about: they "spoke of his departure which he was about to accomplish in Jerusalem".<a name=293:16></a> That is, they are presented to us as persons fully fitted, representing a prime thought in this great scene next to the fact of Jesus being there and changed.<a name=293:17></a>

		J.T.<a name=306:12></a> Well, they are corresponding ideas.<a name=306:13></a> If we were to hear Peter and Paul talk about their experiences, would Peter not speak to Paul of all that he experienced on the mount?<a name=306:14></a> Paul, in his first visit to Peter, remained with him for fifteen days.<a name=306:15></a> Can we not imagine that they talked about that?<a name=306:16></a> Paul could not then say anything to Peter about his experience in Paradise, but suppose we think of them later talking together: Paul would say, I heard wonderful things, Peter; things "which it is not lawful for a man to utter" (2 Corinthians 12:4).<a name=306:17></a> But he was there in Paradise, and surely something remained with him to affect him in his testimony.<a name=306:18></a> I think in that way the Lord encourages us to go in for heavenly things -- for ecstasy, and for part in the things we shall soon be brought into.<a name=306:19></a>

		J.T.<a name=312:1></a> We began these readings with <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#3">Acts  3</a>where we are told by the Spirit that the heavens must receive the Lord Jesus until the times of the restitution of all things, of which God has spoken by His prophets.<a name=312:2></a> The suggestion was made that the prophets being thus mentioned and the times to which they pointed, that is, the times of refreshing which are to come, we might look into the general position in that respect, considering Elijah and Elisha to clarify the subject.<a name=312:3></a> We considered the Lord viewed in the Acts as received into heaven until the times of the restitution of all things.<a name=312:4></a> He is thus there and, while not on His own throne, He is occupied.<a name=312:5></a> The book of Acts and the epistles would unfold in due course how He is employed now in this provisional time until He takes up the government of the universe, including the earth, and sits on His own throne.<a name=312:6></a> This led us to considerable inquiry into <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#9">Luke  9</a>and <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#17">Matthew  17</a>, which chapters tell us of the holy mount of Transfiguration; but the point especially in mind was in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#9">Luke  9</a>, that Moses and Elias appeared in glory.<a name=312:7></a> They appeared as identified, not simply as figurative persons or persons that might be ordinarily seen in a vision; they were real, being referred to as 'men', talking with the Lord about His departure which He should accomplish at Jerusalem, facts which open up a wide theme as to what exists now in heaven.<a name=312:8></a> The divine thought is already reached.<a name=312:9></a> Although the resurrection in its full sense has not yet taken place, yet some have been raised and some have gone to heaven without having died; so that eternal conditions are already effected, the Lord indeed having said in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:2">John  14:2</a>, "I go to prepare you
