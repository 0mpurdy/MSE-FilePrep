	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What enters into these scriptures as the subject for an address is the idea of naming persons and things.<a name=1:1></a> I might remark that the first to give a name formally was God.<a name=1:2></a> It is indeed a divine prerogative to give names.<a name=1:3></a> This prerogative is seen in God Himself, who, as it is said, called their name, that is the name of the man and the woman, Adam, in the day that they were created.<a name=1:4></a> It is seen there in God.<a name=1:5></a> And then in His representatives later throughout the Scriptures, we have the divine prerogative of name-giving, until we get into the New Testament, in which we find the Lord Jesus, God manifest in flesh, employing this same prerogative in giving names.<a name=1:6></a> In a way that is more interesting to us, or should be, than this, for each of us is named by the Lord.<a name=1:7></a> So that both now and in the future, our distinction through life shall be expressed in the name given.<a name=1:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have, indeed, in the beginning of the Acts, the crowd of names.<a name=1:9></a> It might be thought that that is a little disorderly or irregular -- a crowd.<a name=1:10></a> It is certainly not an assembly thought.<a name=1:11></a> But it is remarkably accurate.<a name=1:12></a> It is used for it brings out what I am, in that each of those one hundred and twenty persons had a distinction.<a name=1:13></a> The fact that they are seen prolifically does not rob them severally of that distinction.<a name=1:14></a> And they are counted.<a name=1:15></a> So that it becomes very interesting to those of us who are taken up sovereignly, that we shall develop under the hand of the Lord, especially through discipline, what is in the divine mind, so that it may be expressed in each of us.<a name=1:16></a> Cases may arise as to persons and of course, alas, there are many -- as far as we can see -- who are under
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		discipline, whose spiritual distinction is not visible to us.<a name=2:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in these cases we have to retire, and we can do so restfully, knowing that there will be no discrepancy whatever in result -- that each one will fit as he is designed to fit.<a name=2:2></a> How it comes about is another matter, and is inscrutable as far as we are concerned.<a name=2:3></a> But the names will all be there, and each will shine in his own glory; "for star differs from star in glory", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:41">1 Corinthians  15:41</a>.<a name=2:4></a> We can take that to suggest as to what we should be, dear brethren; that the brilliance and radiance of light should be in us, as the light is the life.<a name=2:5></a> The idea of life is that the life is the light.<a name=2:6></a> "In him was life, and the life was the light of men".<a name=2:7></a> So in each of us the life developed has been the light.<a name=2:8></a> And that will radiate and denote the name.<a name=2:9></a> For the stars are all named, and so are the saints.<a name=2:10></a> The saints are the new creation, and all bears on them -- what each of the saints is to be.<a name=2:11></a> All that is very wonderful, and far more than I could touch on now.<a name=2:12></a> But, as I said, it is a divine prerogative to give names, and every believer comes under that.<a name=2:13></a> The examples we have are only to remind us of the universality of the principle.<a name=2:14></a> It could not be otherwise as we think of the saints and how God regards them -- that each should be divinely in order and distinguished by name, not simply accidental, but given divinely, as in the case of Peter.<a name=2:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, what I have in mind is to transfer that thought to ourselves -- as to giving names -- how we are to acquire the way of it.<a name=2:16></a> One may say that of me as I am able to name a thing.<a name=2:17></a> We will see some propensities in names, and there are many.<a name=2:18></a> The natural man has a great many.<a name=2:19></a> The Spirit of God has a list of the propensities or the evils of man -- what proceeds out of his heart.<a name=2:20></a> The Lord gives a list of about thirteen.<a name=2:21></a> The apostle Paul gives about sixteen works of the flesh in Galatians, and about ten descriptions

	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		of wicked men in the letter to Corinth.<a name=3:1></a> These are to be tabulated and watched over.<a name=3:2></a> One has to discover them in oneself.<a name=3:3></a> As one discovers them in oneself, and gives the name proper to each, one has the mastery over it.<a name=3:4></a> I do not say the name itself gives the mastery over it, but the Holy Spirit enables you to master it.<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, this leads me to the first scripture read -- that is in Timothy.<a name=3:6></a> We have two names that only appear in this particular scripture, although they allude to persons that lived many hundreds of years earlier -- Jannes and Jambres.<a name=3:7></a> We need not tax ourselves as to how the apostle Paul arrived at these names.<a name=3:8></a> He wrote by the Spirit of God.<a name=3:9></a> We need not tax ourselves as to how Jude knew that Enoch had prophesied about sinners in our own times.<a name=3:10></a> He spoke also by the Spirit of God.<a name=3:11></a> The Spirit of God is conversant with every person and thing from the beginning of the creation until now.<a name=3:12></a> But then if Paul used these names there surely is some reason -- it is not merely that what he wrote was indited by the Spirit.<a name=3:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The epistle is a peculiar one.<a name=3:14></a> It is, you might say, his last will and testament.<a name=3:15></a> The saints were in his heart.<a name=3:16></a> The truth was in his heart.<a name=3:17></a> He was concerned about the truth.<a name=3:18></a> He says to Timothy, "the things that thou halt heard of me .<a name=3:19></a>.<a name=3:20></a>.<a name=3:21></a> commit thou to faithful men", <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:2">2 Timothy  2:2</a>.<a name=3:22></a> He was concerned that that should be cared for -- put into the hands of faithful men -- not as a creed.<a name=3:23></a> He had in mind that his teaching should be handed down in spirit, as in the hands of faithful men.<a name=3:24></a> He was concerned about that.<a name=3:25></a> It was his last will and testament.<a name=3:26></a> He desired that the precious truth that he had received from the Lord should be handed down to us, not only in letter but in the Spirit.<a name=3:27></a> And so he is concerned about it in that way, and in many other things one might cite, in order that the truth might stand, and the structure
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		of the assembly might stand, as the structure of the assembly of God stands.<a name=4:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing that he stresses is the things that are "in Christ Jesus" -- everything was there.<a name=4:2></a> The whole letter is permeated with the thought that what is most precious should be cared for, the things that are "in Christ Jesus" -- the promise of life, for instance, and truth and love.<a name=4:3></a> And many other things that I might cite, as "salvation which is in Christ Jesus".<a name=4:4></a> All is fixed in that way in infinite security, and so it has come down to us intact.<a name=4:5></a> And then, as to the negative side he mentions these two names, Jannes and Jambres.<a name=4:6></a> One would inquire as to where he got those names.<a name=4:7></a> How his mind travelled back to the Nile!<a name=4:8></a> How he would think of those magicians imitating what Aaron did with his rod turning water to blood.<a name=4:9></a> How he would think of Pharaoh here.<a name=4:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then there was the gruesome thing of the Nile being turned into blood, and the poor Egyptians digging around for a little water.<a name=4:11></a> That which is for the refreshment of men turned into death -- the mere profession of christianity.<a name=4:12></a> How he would feel that!<a name=4:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And as he proceeded to the next plague, the plague of frogs, he would feel that demons were creeping in amongst the saints.<a name=4:14></a> How he would be conscious of it as he was there in person in Rome, hearing about the saints throughout the world.<a name=4:15></a> The doctrine of demons -- such doctrine as was taught by Hymenaeus and Philetus -- doctrines that eat as doth a gangrene.<a name=4:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then he comes along and thinks of the plague of gnats.<a name=4:17></a> He would see how the plagues of Egypt corresponded with his own times.<a name=4:18></a> The third plague referred to what God was doing, I mean doing consistently with Himself.<a name=4:19></a> The frogs did not denote what is of God.<a name=4:20></a> They denote what is of demons.<a name=4:21></a> The river turned into blood denotes death.<a name=4:22></a> But when you come to the dust of the earth -- all the dust of Egypt, we are told -- the rod of Moses turned it into
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		gnats.<a name=5:1></a> You may see there a sure representative of life, figurative of the saints.<a name=5:2></a> If God takes up a symbol in that way, we shall find that God has done it in wisdom.<a name=5:3></a> There is no modification of the third plague.<a name=5:4></a> It is simply brought in, and there is no cessation of it here.<a name=5:5></a> It is not said to cease like the others.<a name=5:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How all that would come up in the mind of the great servant of God that I am speaking of.<a name=5:7></a> He is speaking of the life that is in Christ Jesus.<a name=5:8></a> The promise of life before the world was -- fixed in Christ.<a name=5:9></a> Men and women are being made to live, in the power of God, in relation to that.<a name=5:10></a> How all that would come into his mind.<a name=5:11></a> And so, as I said, the dust of Egypt was turned into living creatures, reminding us of how results were made.<a name=5:12></a> Adam was made of dust -- but then made to live.<a name=5:13></a> And then we read in that same epistle that God has brought through the gospel life and incorruptibility to light.<a name=5:14></a> Not only are we made to live in mortal bodies, but incorruptibility means immortality.<a name=5:15></a> Life and immortality are brought to light.<a name=5:16></a> How great are all these things!<a name=5:17></a> This thought of life -- all things made to live in Christ.<a name=5:18></a> "Quickened together with him", <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:13">Colossians  2:13</a>.<a name=5:19></a> How the apostle would think of all that.<a name=5:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These two names come into his mind.<a name=5:21></a> He understands.<a name=5:22></a> He brings down the whole position of the plagues in Egypt to the present time, and he shows that the enemy, in his agents, was acting against the truth of God.<a name=5:23></a> These two men Jannes and Jambres are the agents against Moses.<a name=5:24></a> So they are today against the people of God -- against the truth.<a name=5:25></a> As "Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, thus these also withstand the truth".<a name=5:26></a> Now I speak in this way, dear brethren, of the importance of being able to name things, and to give them the right names.<a name=5:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are confronted with this wicked opposition resident in these men.<a name=5:28></a> As they withstood Moses so these men withstand the truth at the present time.<a name=5:29></a> There

		they are.<a name=6:1></a> These two men existed.<a name=6:2></a> They are in the mind of the Spirit of God.<a name=6:3></a> They are carried down, and the apostle Paul is used to name them for the first time, so that you may understand the distinction they had as ministers of Satan.<a name=6:4></a> He speaks of ministers of Satan in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#11:13">2 Corinthians  11:13</a> - 15.<a name=6:5></a> Yet they were probably nominally in fellowship at Corinth turned into angels of light.<a name=6:6></a> As soon as I can give the name to a thing, I have the mastery.<a name=6:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, I go on to 2 Kings.<a name=6:8></a> We read that Hezekiah broke in pieces the brazen serpent -- he called it Nehushtan.<a name=6:9></a> As far as I know, we only get it once in Scripture.<a name=6:10></a> We get what it means, of course  -- a piece of brass.<a name=6:11></a> But it refers to something handed down that once was good.<a name=6:12></a> What a history it had.<a name=6:13></a> And I see it lifted up.<a name=6:14></a> The Lord Jesus Himself refers to it.<a name=6:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, thus must the Son of man be lifted up", <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:14">John  3:14</a>.<a name=6:16></a> The Lord Jesus took the words into His own mouth.<a name=6:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"If .<a name=6:18></a>.<a name=6:19></a>.<a name=6:20></a> any man .<a name=6:21></a>.<a name=6:22></a>.<a name=6:23></a> beheld the serpent of brass, he lived".<a name=6:24></a> What virtue was in that serpent at that time!<a name=6:25></a> But has it got the virtue now?<a name=6:26></a> No.<a name=6:27></a> It never was essentially anything more than a piece of brass.<a name=6:28></a> But then God put virtue in it at that time.<a name=6:29></a> And faith laid hold of that.<a name=6:30></a> It is a type of Christ.<a name=6:31></a> Looking at it at that time was looking at Christ.<a name=6:32></a> "If a serpent had bitten any man, and he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived", <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21:9">Numbers  21:9</a>.<a name=6:33></a> It was the way of life.<a name=6:34></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The word 'tradition' in itself is not objectionable, but as used in apostate christendom, it is a pernicious thought, and apostate christianity is built up largely on tradition.<a name=6:35></a> That is, what is called the writings of the fathers, running on down for several centuries.<a name=6:36></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And the Apocrypha, too, writings that in themselves may be very spurious -- ones containing things that cannot be used as the foundation of the faith and hence are pernicious.<a name=6:37></a> And here was this piece of brass carried down to the days of Hezekiah.<a name=6:38></a> And so

		it was that a man of faith corresponding with Paul was needed; Hezekiah was a wonderful saint.<a name=7:1></a> He had his blemishes, alas, but he is a wonderful saint, and is honoured in that he is able to use this word 'Nehushtan'.<a name=7:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As I am speaking here tonight, I think of the young people.<a name=7:3></a> Look around and think of the evils that confront you -- things that have been carried into the teachings of the school from tradition -- or from modernism, that is the opposite to it.<a name=7:4></a> And it is for each to be able to say, 'That is that', to tabulate it.<a name=7:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As soon as you do it in faith, you have overcome it.<a name=7:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is one of the most practical things I can bring before you.<a name=7:7></a> You can name a thing for yourself, not borrowing it from others.<a name=7:8></a> Hezekiah did not borrow his name, nor did Paul.<a name=7:9></a> It was his own spiritual intelligence that the Holy Spirit used.<a name=7:10></a> And that is what I am leading to, that you might be able to put a name on it.<a name=7:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'Well', they might say to Hezekiah, 'this thing has been used as an object of address.<a name=7:12></a> It has been used as a deity'.<a name=7:13></a> And we have such things as that.<a name=7:14></a> Suppose I take the Lord's supper, one of the most precious things we have; what has it become?<a name=7:15></a> Generally abroad, particularly in Rome, what was once just a symbol of the Lord Jesus, and is yet to those who love Him, has become an object of veneration.<a name=7:16></a> Well, as soon as a man gets his eye opened to that, what does he say?<a name=7:17></a> 'Open idolatry'.<a name=7:18></a> That is what it is.<a name=7:19></a> What does a man that has his eye opened say?<a name=7:20></a> 'Well', he says, 'that is just apiece of bread'.<a name=7:21></a> And that is what Hezekiah means.<a name=7:22></a> 'It is just a trifle of brass.<a name=7:23></a> With all your incense that is what it is'.<a name=7:24></a> Well now, who is able to say that of himself?<a name=7:25></a> 'I have seen the thing.<a name=7:26></a> I know that that thing has become venerated and worshipped and all it is is a traditional thing turned into idolatry'.<a name=7:27></a> We can name it, you see, and as I name it I am delivered from it.<a name=7:28></a> I have mastered it.<a name=7:29></a>

		<a name=8>[Page 8]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, I go on to what is more positive, and that is, the assembly viewed as a mother.<a name=8:1></a> I suppose the idea of the mother is in the range of each person.<a name=8:2></a> Almost every child here has some conception of the mother.<a name=8:3></a> I suppose the knowledge of the mother is primary with every person.<a name=8:4></a> The mother has to do with us more than any, and a mother's love and a mother's care remain, perhaps, more than any with every person.<a name=8:5></a> And so it is that the picture in <a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#3">1 Kings  3</a>helps us as to discerning the saints in this light.<a name=8:6></a> It is a guide to us.<a name=8:7></a> Here are two persons -- two mothers  -- and they are contending for a living child.<a name=8:8></a> Who is the mother of the child?<a name=8:9></a> There is only one man in the whole universe that can tell who the mother of that child is.<a name=8:10></a> Thank God for him!<a name=8:11></a> He is a type of Christ.<a name=8:12></a> He had prayed for wisdom and God greatly honoured that prayer.<a name=8:13></a> He says, 'I have heard it.<a name=8:14></a> And I gave you wisdom.<a name=8:15></a> I greatly honour you because you did not pray for other things'.<a name=8:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And he is tested because of his wisdom.<a name=8:17></a> God loves to test us and brings up one test after another.<a name=8:18></a> Whether we can name the real thing in the test, brings out where we are, if we have had to do with God.<a name=8:19></a> These propensities and traits of evil that I have been speaking of; by the process of elimination, have I been able to tell the evil from the good?<a name=8:20></a> Evil is apt to so clothe itself that it will appear at least portionately good, and that is what tests me.<a name=8:21></a> "Woe unto them who call evil good, and good evil".<a name=8:22></a> They are not able to name things.<a name=8:23></a> And so Solomon is tested.<a name=8:24></a> And each of us is tested.<a name=8:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These two women are figurative of the saints.<a name=8:26></a> Where is the mother?<a name=8:27></a> What am I going to call these people?<a name=8:28></a> As I look abroad in Christendom today, I see how many sects there are.<a name=8:29></a> Do I really feel how incongruous it is?<a name=8:30></a> What is my response now the thing is there before me?<a name=8:31></a> Can I put a name on these?<a name=8:32></a>

		That is what comes out.<a name=9:1></a> Where is the child?<a name=9:2></a> A living child, not a dead one.<a name=9:3></a> This woman is standing there and says, 'That is my son'.<a name=9:4></a> And the other one says, 'No, that is my son'.<a name=9:5></a> And the king says, "Bring me a sword".<a name=9:6></a> Now, dear friends, the sword is the word of God.<a name=9:7></a> It penetrates, according to the description we have of it, "piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart".<a name=9:8></a> I am in the presence of the king, of Christ, and he says, "Bring me a sword".<a name=9:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		He is going to use it.<a name=9:10></a> If the living child is to be cut in two, the mother says, 'Oh no!<a name=9:11></a> That cannot be'.<a name=9:12></a> She yearned for her child.<a name=9:13></a> That is what to look for, genuine affection for the people of God.<a name=9:14></a> Look for loyalty to Christ, of course, but love for one another.<a name=9:15></a> "By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have love amongst yourselves", <a href="../bible/John.htm#13:35">John  13:35</a>.<a name=9:16></a> Look for that.<a name=9:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here, you see, it is like a company of Christians.<a name=9:18></a> They go after the child.<a name=9:19></a> They bring them up on the manna.<a name=9:20></a> For they "all ate the same spiritual food, and all drank the same spiritual drink, for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed them: (now the rock was the Christ; )" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10:3">1 Corinthians  10:3</a>, 4.<a name=9:21></a> One would love to speak of it to every Christian in the world.<a name=9:22></a> Find the mother; to be able to put this name on the saints viewed in that light.<a name=9:23></a> And thus the woman that says, 'Cut the child in two', represents professing Christianity.<a name=9:24></a> She was heartless.<a name=9:25></a> She is not the mother of the child.<a name=9:26></a> See how she is to go.<a name=9:27></a> She is to leave that public position with that stamp upon her.<a name=9:28></a> She is not a true mother.<a name=9:29></a> Whereas the other has disclosed her true heart.<a name=9:30></a> Like the Lord Jesus and like the apostle Paul, we yearn for our brethren.<a name=9:31></a> Well now, that is assembly truth, as presented to us in Galatians.<a name=9:32></a> Sarah is the type of it.<a name=9:33></a> She is the true mother of the child.<a name=9:34></a> Jerusalem above is our

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, I pass on to the last scripture read in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2">Genesis  2</a>, so that I may bring out this position more clearly.<a name=10:4></a> We read that He "brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them".<a name=10:5></a> Think of the wonderful simplicity of it.<a name=10:6></a> He took a sheep and brought it before Adam.<a name=10:7></a> Now what has He got in His mind?<a name=10:8></a> "To see what he would call them".<a name=10:9></a>

		And then finally, in chapter 17, the Lord is seen as High Priest.<a name=13:14></a> Although John does not give these official titles, yet we can see, by the service He renders, what He says when speaking to His Father, how the divine service is carried on, how the Minister of the sanctuary carries on the service and what place the saints have in it, carried along in the ministry in the teaching of this book, carried along to be alongside the Lord in His speaking to the Father, in which speaking, or we might say, prayer, He calls His disciples men whom the Father gives Him.<a name=13:15></a> So that He is manifesting His name to them in verse 6, and in verse 26, "I have made known to them thy name,

		J.T.<a name=32:1></a> It will be noticed in each of these scriptures that the Spirit of God is largely concerned that we might know -- first that we might be independent of man as regards the antichrist and the many antichrists spoken of in chapter 2; then in the end of chapter 3 as regards God abiding in us, and that we might know the spirits that are current, for evil teaching is not simply by men, but it is wicked spirits using them; then again we have the thought of knowing that we abide in God and He in us, by the Spirit; and finally the testimony of the Spirit as to the water and the blood, that is, the death of Christ.<a name=32:2></a> A christian should be intelligent as to all these things; the end throughout the epistle is that things are known; it finishes by saying, "We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in the wicked one.<a name=32:3></a> And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us an understanding that we should know him that is true; and we are in him that is true, in his Son Jesus Christ".<a name=32:4></a> The first two scriptures, as will be observed, are addressed to little children; the second at the end of chapter 3 and beginning of chapter 4 is addressed to the saints as a whole, viewed as the family of God, and so is the passage in chapter 5.<a name=32:5></a> So that our first remarks would bear on the young amongst us, exposed to the spirit of antichrist in the schools, and current literature.<a name=32:6></a> The Spirit is spoken of in this chapter under the appellation of the 'unction' or 'anointing'.<a name=32:7></a> In verse 20 we have an unction from the Holy One, and know all things, and then verse 27 says that "the unction which ye have received from him abides in

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=35:11></a> I think it is John's way of speaking; whether he alludes to the Father or to the Son, and we might add even the Spirit, the pronoun is used; as for instance, in verse 29, "ye know that he is righteous", that would be Christ in a practical way, but it is God, too.<a name=35:12></a> It helps us at the present time to see that it is God, and how John is so full of the Deity, whether it be in any one of the Persons, or in the whole Three, John uses the pronoun, without at the time being specific.<a name=35:13></a> I think that is his way of imparting the thought of the Deity of each of the Persons.<a name=35:14></a> What has been remarked as to the Holy One in verse 20 is, I think, important; that underlying all teaching is the holiness of God, and all antichristian teaching is without it, and must of necessity be without it.<a name=35:15></a> That is the test.<a name=35:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=36:8></a> Well, the thought of anointing in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#1">2 Corinthians  1</a>is to mark us off; it is not a question of teaching.<a name=36:9></a> "Now he that establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, is God, who also has sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts".<a name=36:10></a> That is a threefold expression of the truth of what God has done by the Spirit.<a name=36:11></a> There is not much difference, so far as I understand, between the two words; in either case I think it is what is external characteristically, what the saint is as marked off from others by the Spirit.<a name=36:12></a> His public external characteristic is the anointing, and then the sealing is the assertion of divine ownership, and the earnest would be his own portion in his heart.<a name=36:13></a> God has done all that by the Spirit.<a name=36:14></a> Now the anointing here (1 John) has in mind what is seen in the way of teaching as over against the ordinary teachings of men; and the fact that it is of the Holy One is to stress the thought of holiness.<a name=36:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=42:10></a> Well, confessing Him to be Son of God is a further thought.<a name=42:11></a> The verses we have read speak of the Spirit, and that is what we are dealing with, to show the place the Spirit has in this epistle, and how essential He is to our practical enjoyment of fixity of our Christianity.<a name=42:12></a> Many other things, of course, are mentioned in that verse; and then again in verse 16, "God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him".<a name=42:13></a> There is much that works out of these verses by the Spirit, but the point is that the Spirit is the actual power to make it all effective in us, to make it sure to us, giving us the consciousness of it.<a name=42:14></a> Then as regards the teaching that is current, the beginning of chapter 4 speaks of the spirits, we are not to believe every, spirit, but to prove them, as to whether they are of God, because many false prophets are gone out into the world.<a name=42:15></a> "Every spirit which confesses Jesus Christ come in flesh is of God; and every spirit which does not confess Jesus Christ come in flesh is not of God".<a name=42:16></a> So that it is the incarnation that is in mind -- Jesus Christ come in flesh; not <i>has</i> come, but <i>is</i> come -- it is the present fact; and every spirit that confesses that is of God.<a name=42:17></a> It is christianity essentially, as knowing Christ.<a name=42:18></a>

		I wish to speak this evening about sheep, that is, sinners viewed as such, and then saints viewed as sheep.<a name=50:1></a> When Adam named the creatures, the land animals particularly, he would convey, in the names given, the traits of each; according to God, the name is to convey what the person or thing is characteristically, and these traits were intended by God, as in these creatures, to serve His testimony later.<a name=50:2></a> Some of them even represented Christ Himself in a figurative way, and among these sheep are worthy of special attention.<a name=50:3></a> The idea of a sheep is used to typify, in certain senses, the Lord Himself; indeed, in this very chapter I have read from in Isaiah, the Lord is said to have been like a sheep dumb before His shearers, as you will observe -- "he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth".<a name=50:4></a> That is a sheep characteristic, and I hope to come back to it as seen in Christ, showing that God intends in the gospel to secure us at least in that characteristic, for the gospel has Christ in mind, not only as the Saviour, but as the Model for all those who are saved; God intends to make all the saints like Jesus.<a name=50:5></a> A sheep does not represent all that Jesus is, even typically, there are other important features, but the sheep has a great place.<a name=50:6></a> John's sheep particularly represent the saints as conformed to Christ and attractive to Him, loved by Him because of that.<a name=50:7></a> They are not viewed as straying or lost in John, because John is concerned about persons who are like Christ, and the sheep are amongst these, they represent that.<a name=50:8></a> But Isaiah, by the Spirit, says, "All we

		 saints get light, they do not submit to the washing.<a name=60:1></a> The laver stood in the court as you came into the divine system; there must be the washing -- "If I wash thee not", says Jesus, "thou hast no part with me", <a href="../bible/John.htm#13:8">John  13:8</a>.<a name=60:2></a> The Lord would say, I have you, but there must be the washing, the submission to the truth in its cleansing character; not only the blood of Christ, but the water that flowed from His side.<a name=60:3></a> They came up from the washing, they had been down there; I suppose that means it is a descent, like baptism.<a name=60:4></a> As we see with Philip and the eunuch, there needs to be a going down to the water; there is ascent from that.<a name=60:5></a> In chapter 4 we have the same language only it is added that they are shorn sheep; you say, there is not much difference, but there is as regards characteristics; it is like Jesus as a sheep dumb before His shearers.<a name=60:6></a> That is how Jesus was, He submitted to the shearers, that is taking up what particularly belongs to the sheep.<a name=60:7></a> Many hold themselves aloof in self-will, they will not submit to the requirements of the fellowship.<a name=60:8></a> The fellowship has requirements, the Lord has requirements, and shorn sheep, of course, are easier washed -- that is, the idea is that you submit.<a name=60:9></a> The Lord gave His "back to the smiters", too, it says, and His "cheeks to them that plucked off the hair" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#50:6">Isaiah  50:6</a>), there is submission.<a name=60:10></a> That is a great point in christianity; one is of no value really in the attached state of things aside from submission.<a name=60:11></a> The church is said to be subjected to Christ, that is the mind of God, and practically it must be so, for naturally we have so many wills instead of only one will as in the assembly.<a name=60:12></a> Another thing that is mentioned here, and it is a very important thing, too, is that under these circumstances you have fruit-bearing.<a name=60:13></a> But the beautiful thought of the mystery, of the teeth as essential to beauty, is what the Lord stresses, but the word is added that they come up from the washing.<a name=60:14></a> That is, the Lord sees the

		I want to show the feature in which Christ appears in him at the outset.<a name=130:1></a> Much, of course, is said about him and by him in the chapter that I cannot touch upon.<a name=130:2></a> The point I wish to bring forward as foundational in the structure I would seek to build up in this address is that Christ was in John sacrificially.<a name=130:3></a> He calls Him the Lamb of God as he sees Him.<a name=130:4></a> Earlier he said He is "preferred before me, for he was before me", <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:15">John  1:15</a>.<a name=130:5></a> He said also he was not worthy to stoop down and to unlatch His shoe.<a name=130:6></a> But when he sees Him coming to him he says, "Behold the Lamb of God".<a name=130:7></a> It is a question of movement.<a name=130:8></a> The sacrificial thought is conveyed in movement.<a name=130:9></a> When Adam gave names to the creatures you may be sure the sacrificial idea would be there.<a name=130:10></a> Noah was to know the clean from the unclean creatures.<a name=130:11></a> Doubtless their names would carry down something to him as to this and there can be no doubt that the lamb carried with it a sacrificial thought, "the Lamb of God".<a name=130:12></a> Adam could not connect any creatures specifically as above others with God, but now we have the "Lamb of God".<a name=130:13></a> John is able to designate Him as he sees Him coming to him and so it is that every believer foundationally has some conception of Christ coming to him.<a name=130:14></a> It may be we have not thought of this.<a name=130:15></a> When he saw Him coming to him he said, "Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world".<a name=130:16></a> It was the movement undoubtedly.<a name=130:17></a> What is said of John is to bring out his qualities.<a name=130:18></a>

		J.T.<a name=140:1></a> I was thinking as our brother was reading the scripture as to how the scriptures approach the subject of households in the New Testament.<a name=140:2></a> Paul seems to be the vessel through whom the subject is introduced properly, and how it arose from his being invited into a house.<a name=140:3></a> If one lived in Abraham's time, and were invited into his house, one would find order there.<a name=140:4></a> But Ishmael was there.<a name=140:5></a> There is a slight discrepancy there -- I mean to say, Ishmael was there, and when Isaac was born he was mocking.<a name=140:6></a> In the New Testament the apostle is invited into a house and no one on earth could be a better judge of a household at that time than he.<a name=140:7></a> The householder says, "If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16:15">Acts  16:15</a>.<a name=140:8></a> Now that seems to be the start of the thought in the New Testament from the standpoint of apostolic ministry.<a name=140:9></a> The apostle is one capable of judging a house.<a name=140:10></a> He is invited in on the ground of the householder being judged by him to be faithful.<a name=140:11></a>

		I wises to speak tonight about individuality, that is, in a spiritual sense.<a name=240:1></a> We really begin on that principle to attain to what is in the mind of God for us, and also for Himself.<a name=240:2></a> As the boards of the tabernacle had each an individuality, so each saint begins with this if he is to attain to the great design of God for him, and for Himself.<a name=240:3></a> The great design in Exodus was the tabernacle.<a name=240:4></a> That was for God.<a name=240:5></a> He said, "And they shall make <i>me</i> a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#25:8">Exodus  25:8</a>.<a name=240:6></a> So each item has its existence separately, and as regards the boards which represent more fully what I am speaking of, they were made standing up.<a name=240:7></a> It is the divine thought that individuality in us implies an upright position, and the balance that is necessary to it.<a name=240:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And this brings up the matter of the material, the wood out of which the boards were formed; so that we begin in the wilderness with the wood, which is the great abstract thought of what I am speaking about.<a name=240:9></a> Jehovah <i>showed</i> Moses wood.<a name=240:10></a> It alludes to a kind of humanity that has to be shown.<a name=240:11></a> The world knows it not; the world knew Christ not.<a name=240:12></a> That is, it did not know Him really as to the nature of His humanity.<a name=240:13></a> And in regard of that, dear brethren, we have to speak of Christ's humanity as it was and as it is.<a name=240:14></a> The humanity as it was was unique.<a name=240:15></a> There never was a man like Jesus before, nor since, nor ever shall be!<a name=240:16></a> There never was a Man like Him in that humanity inclusive of the condition.<a name=240:17></a> There are those before and after like Him morally, but not physically.<a name=240:18></a> He was alone -- a unique kind of humanity.<a name=240:19></a>

		think of it, it will arouse considerable reflection, and contemplation, and meditation: that there was a Man here for thirty-three years -- only Himself -- only like Himself -- not one before, or then, or since, or for ever!<a name=241:1></a> It was a kind of humanity all of itself -- perfectly man, in every respect a man, yet unique; a Man so as to accomplish redemption, to set aside the condition of flesh and blood as before God and to replace it with another kind of humanity; not that which He took on in flesh and blood but one of which we have spoken today which is spiritual and yet physical; spiritually physical -- flesh and bones, not blood.<a name=241:2></a>

		That is the thought, dear brethren, and I wanted to enlarge on it: first in Romans -- how we enter on individuality spiritually.<a name=242:1></a> I am an individual, a whole being -- tri-partite, as it is called, but a whole being.<a name=242:2></a> It is not without significance that it is so, that man is spirit, soul, and body, and intended to be so far self-contained.<a name=242:3></a> So in Romans in this sentence I read, "I myself", is the thought.<a name=242:4></a> Who am I?<a name=242:5></a> Every one of us is conscious of his existence, that it is "I myself".<a name=242:6></a> Not simply 'I'; that would be enough to express individuality but not conscious individuality.<a name=242:7></a> It must be "I myself" to convey that fully.<a name=242:8></a> Now I have to analyse that, and in order to do that I have to learn to judge; that is, to be master of the institution, for it is an institution.<a name=242:9></a> Every human being is an institution, if you understand, and God intends him to be that spiritually.<a name=242:10></a> So it is "I myself".<a name=242:11></a>

		The thought of prophesying has become an important feature among the Lord's people, and this chapter in 1 Corinthians illustrates what such ministry may effect.<a name=254:1></a> We read in verse 22 that prophecy is not for them that believe not, but for them that believe, and in verse 24, "But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all: And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth".<a name=254:2></a> A very important effect of ministry is that it presents the Lord to our hearts; in a sense the Lord is present in it.<a name=254:3></a>

		I Have in mind to speak about spirituality, particularly to show how that in the Old Testament it was seen in relation to leadership amongst the people of God.<a name=264:1></a> It was early lost sight of in the history of the assembly, but the Lord took great pains to leave a spiritual state behind when He ascended up to heaven, the forty days were to that end.<a name=264:2></a> He could have gone up to heaven immediately He rose from the dead, but He remained here for forty days.<a name=264:3></a> Those days were occupied in spiritual movements by Him, intended to be educative, intended to impress His own spiritually, and particularly those who were to serve, and all the saints, of course, for He appeared to five hundred brethren at one time, but particularly those who were to serve and lead the saints.<a name=264:4></a>

		So, in Mark, which evangelist stresses the thought of service more than the others, we are told He appeared to two, and "in another form", we are not told what that form was, but it was <i>another</i> -- as if to suggest that what form He may take at any time is left open.<a name=264:5></a> Mark is the only one that mentions this and no doubt he has in mind those who were to serve, and in serving, if acceptable to God and profitable to the saints, this will put them in the place of leadership in some sense.<a name=264:6></a> The idea of a leader is not simply that one can answer questions in a Bible reading, but one who goes on in service and suffering, whom others can emulate; a leader is one who goes before in a spiritual way, acceptable to God and profitable to men; such give a lead.<a name=264:7></a>

		embodying its history in those two chapters -- seven brief epistles to the seven assemblies which were in the province of Asia, and in the fourth epistle, that is, the one to Thyatira, the Lord formally alludes to a remnant, "Unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira".<a name=292:1></a> He formally recognises a "rest", that is a remnant, for that is the thought in it.<a name=292:2></a> And, as we come down to the sixth letter, that is the one to Philadelphia, He clothes that remnant with the whole thought, that is the whole idea of the assembly, and tells her He is going to make certain to come and worship before her feet -- a remarkable thing!<a name=292:3></a> The Lord, in the Scriptures, strictly bans any worship on our part of man as such.<a name=292:4></a> The whole book of the Revelation has in mind that God is to be worshipped; when John fell down and would worship the angel the Lord sent to show him the wonderful things that are disclosed in the book, it says the angel forbade it.<a name=292:5></a> He said, "See thou do it not: for I am thy fellow servant, and of thy brethren the prophets .<a name=292:6></a>.<a name=292:7></a>.<a name=292:8></a> worship God".<a name=292:9></a> Peter forbade Cornelius to worship him, whereas his professed representative today expects to be worshipped, but Peter forbade it and said, I am a man like you.<a name=292:10></a> But the Lord says to Philadelphia, I will make certain to come and worship before thy feet -- a remarkable thing that He is able to do that persons who say they are Jews and are not, but do lie, they are of the synagogue of Satan, and yet the Lord has power to make them do that.<a name=292:11></a> It is not that they love the saints viewed in Philadelphia; they do not, but the Lord compels them to do it, showing the power He has in that book against those who might be the foes of the assembly.<a name=292:12></a> He says, "I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know .<a name=292:13></a>.<a name=292:14></a>.<a name=292:15></a>" not, that you may know -- she already knows, but that <i>they</i> may know -- "that I have loved thee".<a name=292:16></a> He advertises the fact to them, compels them to know that He loved this assembly.<a name=292:17></a>

		the Spirit of God turns the thing round now; there is another view and a very beautiful view, one of the most beautiful views you can get.<a name=298:1></a> It refers to a certain time when very naughty things were happening amongst the people of God.<a name=298:2></a> God is making great promises, too, in this chapter -- I will open the windows of heaven -- ready to do anything for His people, as He always is.<a name=298:3></a> "Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it", He says elsewhere.<a name=298:4></a> "Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, .<a name=298:5></a>.<a name=298:6></a>.<a name=298:7></a> and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it".<a name=298:8></a> That is God's attitude, and we are proving it, too, in a little way.<a name=298:9></a> But "Then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another" -- this is not ordinary table talk which sometimes is damaging to the saints; foolish conversation and jesting which are not convenient are to be abandoned, but this sort of conversation is heavenly converse -- "they that feared the Lord spake often one to another"they are all on the same footing; the circle of brethren described here sit down together, maybe in a brother's house, at his table, for there is no respect of persons -- I mean, "they that feared the Lord", that is the class in mind, it is the remnant under this heading.<a name=298:10></a> Then they "spake often one to another" -- we are not told what they said, but heaven heard.<a name=298:11></a> One of the most interesting things to me is the activities of heaven that Scripture indicates, and how earth is the great theatre of operations now, and how heaven is attracted by what is going on; and here is a company of brothers and sisters in a town that fear the Lord, and they are at a brother's house or in the meeting room, they are speaking to one another and heaven hears -- it says, "The Lord hearkened, and heard it", that is, He leaned His ear over, so to speak.<a name=298:12></a> Think of that now, think of an action like that on the part of God.<a name=298:13></a>

		Well, how different this is, it is not a cry, He hears from a company of brothers and sisters who fear the Lord; they are speaking one to another in a heavenly way, their voices betoken it; hush, this is important, heaven would say; God hearkened and heard -- He is not deaf, He hearkened and heard.<a name=299:4></a> And He liked what they were saying.<a name=299:5></a> How testing that is as to any matter, any time, that we are in holy converse, for God hears, He likes our voices, but then He likes our words when they are in the power of the Spirit, our conversation is a matter of interest above, dear brethren -- not exactly what they were saying here, we are not told what it was, but the Lord heard their words, and He says, I will put that down in a book.<a name=299:6></a> The use of the word 'book' is interesting -- "book of remembrance".<a name=299:7></a> It is not that the Lord would forget what they say.<a name=299:8></a> He does forget things -- thank God He does, it is one of the comforts of every true saint that God can and does forget; never remember again, is said of the believer's sins before he is converted.<a name=299:9></a> But now He has another book here, it is a book of remembrance written, it says, for them that fear Jehovah.<a name=299:10></a> Some of us may not, you know, for there is a great deal of lightness among the young -- one notices it -- they go off and do things they know they should not, they take up ways they know they should not; that shows the absence of the fear of God -- there is no fear of God before their eyes in that particular matter.<a name=299:11></a> It is for those who fear the Lord this book is written, and it says, "They shall be mine" -- it is what they are to God, that is the point made, not as left here now, but what is heard up there, what is pleasurable up there.<a name=299:12></a> How one would love to look into that book of remembrance!<a name=299:13></a> And then it

		Now finally in Luke what I want to show is the thought carried through to the New Testament; the same remnant, but Christ personally now, not in Spirit only.<a name=300:15></a><a name=300:11></a> Christ was here in Spirit as early as Noah, really here, the Spirit of Christ as man, but not personally, He was still in the form of God; but now He is in the form of Man, or as a Babe, and as such, He is amongst the remnant, so that there is great advancement now, but they are equal to it.<a name=300:16></a><a name=300:12></a> The idea is that God is moving on all the time, and, as we progress, we are moving on with God.<a name=300:17></a><a name=300:13></a> God has come in now in Christ in a Babe -- marvellous thought!<a name=300:18></a><a name=300:14></a> 'Nor yet in triumph passing', as the hymn says, 'but human infancy' (<a href=".<a name=300:19></a>.<a name=300:20></a>\hymns\hymns1972.<a name=300:21></a>htm#188:4">Hymn 188</a>) -- but nevertheless the Person

		And then finally -- the details are full of precious instruction and light now -- Anna comes up at the same time, and we are told how long she had been married -- seven years she had lived with a husband from her virginity, and Simeon is an old man, too, about to depart, but we have not his history -- he is just a man of Jerusalem.<a name=302:12></a> Now we have this woman's history, all is to distinguish her in our eyes; she

		These scriptures treat of the idea of a seal.<a name=304:1></a> The first is that believers are sealed by God.<a name=304:2></a> Secondly that in His foundation there is a seal; the foundation of God has a seal.<a name=304:3></a> This does not allude to the foundation of the earth, but the present building of God.<a name=304:4></a> Then thirdly, that the believer has a seal himself and sets to it that God is true; that is, in all his matters he indicates that his principle, his belief, his fixity, is in the fact that God is true.<a name=304:5></a> I have in mind to speak of these three heads and the general subject of seal, scripturally understood.<a name=304:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In 2 Corinthians the apostle Paul is stressing his desire to be with the brethren in his affections and to carry them with him, so that he identifies himself much with the Corinthians, stressing that they were bound up in the same bundle of life which is a needful thought for every one who ministers, or professes to minister, the truth that he is primarily with the brethren, one of them.<a name=304:7></a> It is said that we are to know our measure, to think of ourselves not highly, not above what we ought to think, but as God has dealt to each a measure of faith.<a name=304:8></a> It is in virtue of this fact of measure that God gives to each that there is the possibility of mutual working, indeed of the truth of the body being developed among us, for the divine measure has in mind that everyone fits -- otherwise there would be dislocation.<a name=304:9></a> If each is to fit according to his own estimate of himself, it is likely that all will be misfits, and we can have no body, we can have nothing of the body of Christ concretely save as there is the recognition of the divine measure; that is accurate.<a name=304:10></a> As the members of our bodies are measured by the Creator, so in the spiritual body, the body of

		Christ; we can only fit as we accept the divine measure, and we are to know it.<a name=305:1></a> "As God has dealt to each a measure of faith".<a name=305:2></a> Whatever may develop practically in us will agree with that; it must agree with it.<a name=305:3></a> So that we are to be on our guard not to have too high an estimate of ourselves, otherwise we shall not fit and we shall damage our usefulness.<a name=305:4></a> Were we so many individuals, so many units, that would not be necessary, but in the organism which God has in mind, the most delicate of all in the universe, there must be measure.<a name=305:5></a> And so the ministers are to work and all of us are to work according to the measure of faith which God has apportioned to each.<a name=305:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So Paul, I believe, is aiming at this in this letter, that the brethren might understand that he is truly one of them, one that can sit down with his brethren.<a name=305:7></a> I have no doubt that he would be glad to listen to another speaking of Christ.<a name=305:8></a> He speaks indeed in this very chapter of himself and Silvanus and Timotheus preaching the Son of God in Corinth.<a name=305:9></a> Whether they preached in separate rooms at the same time or whether they preached one after another, I cannot say, but I have no doubt that if anyone such as Silvanus or Timotheus preached the Son of God and Paul were in the audience, Paul would be his best listener.<a name=305:10></a> He would sit down with his brethren, and join in with them.<a name=305:11></a> Indeed, he tells them that they could all speak one by one, the point being edification, not clericalism; his ministry abominates clericalism.<a name=305:12></a> His aim is to make the saints fit in and that he himself should fit in in the body.<a name=305:13></a> So that he says here, "He that establishes us with you in Christ" -- the great apostle Paul is putting himself with the Corinthians"and has anointed us, is God, who also has sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts".<a name=305:14></a>

		apostle Paul.<a name=306:1></a> We are established by God in the anointing and in the sealing and in the earnest of the Spirit.<a name=306:2></a> So that, when Luke records that the brethren at Troas assembled to break bread, he says "we" -- "We being assembled" -- not 'We and Paul', but "we" including Paul.<a name=306:3></a> This enables us to see the fruitfulness and remarkable power of these words, "less than the least of all saints", and "ourselves your bondmen for Jesus' sake".<a name=306:4></a> Now that is what runs through this epistle, and he brings in great elements of the truth to support him, such as the new covenant and reconciliation and new creation.<a name=306:5></a> These things applied to him as they did to the least in the assembly at Corinth.<a name=306:6></a> "But we all, looking on the glory of the Lord, with unveiled face, are transformed according to the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Lord the Spirit".<a name=306:7></a> The apostle stresses that right through, and this statement comes in in the instruction, that is, that God has sealed us.<a name=306:8></a> God had sealed Paul with the Corinthians, meaning that anyone who saw Paul at any time would see that he belonged to another, that he was not his own; nor did he consider for himself in his ministry.<a name=306:9></a> Indeed, the rights that belonged to him as a minister of Christ he waives: he says so in the first epistle; so that he was a real practical christian as well as the great apostle, perhaps the greatest lover of Christ, too.<a name=306:10></a> In every gift he excelled.<a name=306:11></a> Perhaps his personal example as a christian stands out as much as any other feature of this servant of Christ -- what he was, as he says, "my ways as they are in Christ".<a name=306:12></a> He belonged to Another.<a name=306:13></a> His point was that he did belong to Another.<a name=306:14></a> He renounced selfishness and that is really how the seal is seen, for it is not a symbol worn on the breast or in the forehead or in the hand; the seal of God is moral.<a name=306:15></a> It is in one's demeanour; it is in one's walk and ways.<a name=306:16></a>

		The seal on this foundation has two sides as we have often remarked.<a name=310:14></a> I speak of it now because of the idea of a seal.<a name=310:15></a> You look at it.<a name=310:16></a> You look at the foundation of any human religious organisation on the earth; take the Jewish system, the Romish system, and others; go over all of them one by one they may claim to be on this foundation but they are not.<a name=310:17></a> Each one of them has its own foundation, its own peculiarities, its own tenets; these are stamped upon it.<a name=310:18></a> The seal of God is not stamped upon it.<a name=310:19></a> The foundation of God has a seal and every one who is of God understands it.<a name=310:20></a> The scriptural idea is understood by reading the seal.<a name=310:21></a> The first one is that "the Lord knows those that are His".<a name=310:22></a> If I love the saints I am comforted by that.<a name=310:23></a> However few there may be at a given time that part of the seal is readable by everyone there.<a name=310:24></a> I am not literalising the thing, dear brethren; it is a question of what is spiritual.<a name=310:25></a> In any city or town, sitting down with the brethren who know this foundation, you say, 'I think of this

		one and that one'; it may be a relative, a parent, a child, a son or daughter or neighbour; 'I am sorry they are not here'.<a name=311:1></a> We are not really christians practically if we do not make a remark like that.<a name=311:2></a> We miss our brethren.<a name=311:3></a> We only know a few that are absent.<a name=311:4></a> In speaking to the Lord at any time with a few of the saints, at His supper, we find liberty in telling the Lord that there are a good many in the town that are absent; the Lord would say, 'I know'.<a name=311:5></a> The Lord feels it and He loves us to feel it, too.<a name=311:6></a> He would say, 'They are indelibly on My breastplate'.<a name=311:7></a> He does not forget one, He would say, "Were not the ten cleansed?<a name=311:8></a> but the nine, where are they?<a name=311:9></a>" Perhaps there are those here who have benefited from the death of Christ according to the gospel and who have never responded to His love.<a name=311:10></a> "Where are the nine?<a name=311:11></a>" "Were not the ten cleansed?<a name=311:12></a>" But then, there is one who has returned to glorify God.<a name=311:13></a> The Lord loves us to think with Him, and that is one of the sides of the seal on the foundation.<a name=311:14></a> The more of this there is the more one is assured that it is the foundation of God.<a name=311:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the other side is, "Let every one who names the name of the Lord withdraw from iniquity".<a name=311:16></a> Well, those present have done that.<a name=311:17></a> "All Israel that were present", to use the Old Testament phrase, have done that.<a name=311:18></a> All those in this town who meet on the Lord's day to answer to His request are amongst those who have withdrawn from iniquity.<a name=311:19></a> It may be that there are those here who have not done that.<a name=311:20></a> The Lord has a voice for you.<a name=311:21></a> "Let every one who names the name of the Lord .<a name=311:22></a>.<a name=311:23></a>.<a name=311:24></a>".<a name=311:25></a> That is a matter of consistency.<a name=311:26></a> You may name the name of the Lord -- no doubt you do -- every christian does; you may do it amongst christians but perhaps not amongst the ungodly.<a name=311:27></a> It is amongst the ungodly you must do it.<a name=311:28></a> It is a strong tower and as naming it, if you stay here, that is, amongst the ungodly, you will say, 'I cannot

		Well now, finally, there is this seal that every Christian has; that is, those that have received the testimony.<a name=313:14></a> These words, I apprehend, are the words of John the baptist.<a name=313:15></a> In these verses in chapter 3 of John's gospel, John is speaking about Christ, and he is outstanding in his ability to speak about the glory of Christ.<a name=313:16></a> In the gospel of John he is brought forward as a model for us, and he is speaking about Christ here.<a name=313:17></a> He says, "He who comes from above is above all.<a name=313:18></a> He who has his origin in the earth is of the earth .<a name=313:19></a>.<a name=313:20></a>.<a name=313:21></a> .<a name=313:22></a> He who comes out of heaven is above all, and what he has seen and has heard, this he testifies; and no one receives his testimony".<a name=313:23></a> "Above all" does not mean that He is exalted in heaven, but he is speaking of Jesus here below; He is above all.<a name=313:24></a> That is a great thing to get into our souls.<a name=313:25></a> It delivers us from men.<a name=313:26></a> It is a question of His personal greatness as down here, as come down from heaven.<a name=313:27></a> John saw that, and he says further, "What he has seen and has heard, this he testifies; and no one receives his testimony.<a name=313:28></a> He that has received his testimony has set to his seal

		To be illustrative, it is as if I were to put it on my business documents, all my letterheads, all my business letters, on everything that represents me; on everything that I own or that I do it is manifest that my principle is, among many other things, that God is true; and, dear brethren, that is not any advanced truth, as we say; it is the gospel.<a name=314:6></a> It is introduced in the gospel.<a name=314:7></a> In the epistle to the Romans, the teaching epistle, it says, "Let God be true, and every man false".<a name=314:8></a> Even if I have to be branded in that way, let God be true.<a name=314:9></a> If anything comes up in my history among the brethren, "Let God be true, and every man false; according as it is written, So that thou shouldest be justified in thy words, and shouldest overcome when thou art in judgment".<a name=314:10></a> That is set out in Romans, so that the believer in the gospel begins with that: "Let God be true".<a name=314:11></a> And then, let us seal our things that way.<a name=314:12></a> Everybody that comes into my house -- my seal there is, "God is true"; in my business, "God is true"; in all my relations, in all my manner of life, "God is true".<a name=314:13></a> That man represents God.<a name=314:14></a> The writer's point here is, "He that has received his testimony" -- that is, the testimony of the Man that is here from heaven, the testimony of Jesus -- that man sets to his seal that God is true.<a name=314:15></a> That is what God requires at this time, that we commit ourselves to that, and it is the antidote to lying.<a name=314:16></a> One said, "All men are liars", and in truth it is so.<a name=314:17></a> It is remarkable how naturally we are disposed to lying, to deceive even in a small way.<a name=314:18></a> If anyone discredits us we deny it.<a name=314:19></a> But there is the seal, "God is true".<a name=314:20></a> I have set to my seal that God is true.<a name=314:21></a> I do not want to be different from God.<a name=314:22></a> If I

		These scriptures instruct us as to heaven, and they have been read on this account.<a name=330:1></a> We are drawing near to the end of this wonderful day or year, the acceptable year of the Lord, as it is called, and our heavenly calling and heaven itself are coming into view.<a name=330:2></a> The ministry that God has furnished for a century, and is furnishing, seems more insistent, the Lord Himself participating, having said to His servants as having been successfully engaged in His service, not to rejoice in the service, or the results of it, but rather to rejoice that their names were written in heaven.<a name=330:3></a> This is in view in this statement of the Lord, recorded indeed by the same writer as he who wrote the Acts; in Luke's gospel, the statement is intended to confirm the teaching in this book, particularly that of the apostle Paul.<a name=330:4></a> And believers do well to note that the gospels are reached and only reached rightly through the epistles, the Acts included.<a name=330:5></a> The gospels are all confirmatory of the epistles.<a name=330:6></a>

		Here we begin with the subject of heaven; that is, in chapter 1.<a name=330:7></a> The forty days which are alluded to in the earlier part of this chapter in which the Lord is said to be seen by the disciples, were educational, educational of spirituality, for although heaven is the creation of God and physical, especially the nearer heaven, as also the idea of the higher heaven, yet the understanding of them and participation in the heavenlies essentially require spirituality.<a name=330:8></a> The forty days are intended to qualify us for entering heaven, that we shall not be strangers there, and that we shall not be awkwardly there, but there as knowing, understanding how to be there.<a name=330:9></a> Paul was caught up there, caught up as far as the third heaven, so that

		he had experience of the whole idea of heaven -- caught up into paradise.<a name=331:1></a> This happened early in his history so that it would enter into his ministry although not formally stated.<a name=331:2></a> The history of the heavenlies as we have and shall have to do with them comes in in this chapter after the forty days.<a name=331:3></a> Stress is laid on the fact that the Lord showed Himself to His disciples as living, and then that He was seen by them during forty days.<a name=331:4></a> Elsewhere we have more detail, that is in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15">1 Corinthians  15</a>, but the educational part is essential as to spirituality, dear brethren.<a name=331:5></a> The apostle has to say to certain, "I have not been able to speak to you as to spiritual".<a name=331:6></a> It is a very humbling thing if the Lord cannot minister to us as unto spiritual.<a name=331:7></a> He said, "As to babes in Christ".<a name=331:8></a> Thank God, they were not only babes, but babes in Christ; their state was low in that sense -- a very low state.<a name=331:9></a> So that in order to understand what is in mind now one counts on a measure of spirituality.<a name=331:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What is presented in the first scripture is that the Lord is received out of their sight by a cloud.<a name=331:11></a> A cloud does not characterise our dispensation; we do not get it in Stephen; so that we are here in the presence of a transitional state of things which requires patience.<a name=331:12></a> If there are better things in the purpose of God for us we have to wait for them, and we know that they are there; we have to wait with patience and serve others for that is what is in mind.<a name=331:13></a> The disciples were to learn how to carry on ministry to the Jewish brethren and yet with an inkling of better things for themselves.<a name=331:14></a> So that it is a cloud that intervenes and receives the Lord out of their sight, and two men in white suggest to them that gazing up into heaven was not opportune at that time.<a name=331:15></a> It was not in keeping with the light at the moment.<a name=331:16></a> In all our movements we want to have our eyes and ears governed by the light governing the moment, not to waste time.<a name=331:17></a> The two men in white regulate and we

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, that is the first thought, that the position is one of faith, unlimited faith, too, if we are to progress in order and suitably, as it were, as light comes.<a name=332:7></a> So they are regulated, and it is an important thing that we should be if we have been going beyond the light that governs the moment.<a name=332:8></a> They returned to the city.<a name=332:9></a> The men did not tell them to do that.<a name=332:10></a> They went to the upper room.<a name=332:11></a> The men did not tell them to do that; that is, they are governed by the light; they have an inkling of the heavenly position.<a name=332:12></a> They go to the upper room.<a name=332:13></a> That was, virtually, they do not belong to the ordinary religious sects around us, for there were sects even in Jerusalem then.<a name=332:14></a> As Luke presents it earlier the Lord was separated from them before He was received up, meaning that it was not the idea of the body; He was separated from them.<a name=332:15></a> The Jewish remnant is not a body, not an organism, it never will be; the assembly is.<a name=332:16></a> So that we have the teaching in this earlier instruction -- He was separated from them and carried up into heaven in

		J.T.<a name=348:8></a> It comes in peculiarly in chapter 24; it is reserved for that, that is the covenant in the sense typically of expressing love.<a name=348:9></a> The covenant also demands obedience, as we get in chapter 19 and right through in these four chapters I have mentioned, God asserting His rights amongst His own, His right to be loved indeed; and in chapter 20 He says, There are the thousands of those who love Me, and He wants all to love Him and He brings in, in the type, the Hebrew bondman as the Leader in the love.<a name=348:10></a> So that that is the meaning, I think, of those four chapters; they refer to the land, because that is what is in mind, but the wilderness is still there and they are in it -- it is incidental, but still the service is to begin there, and as the question of obedience is settled, as it is in these chapters, then we have the thought of going up.<a name=348:11></a> God says, Now the way has been cleared for the saints to come up, and the Mediator immediately raises again the question of obedience, in chapter 24 and, as the people accept the proposals of God, then he builds twelve pillars and an altar at the foot of the mountain, for that is where the moral matter is settled, it is on the low level.<a name=348:12></a> Then the service begins in the youths, the young men

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=353:5></a> Quite so.<a name=353:6></a> Moses took the blood (in verse 8) and sprinkled it on the people (notice that) and said, "Behold the blood of the covenant that Jehovah has made with you concerning all these words".<a name=353:7></a> So that you can see the striking place the covenant has; in 2 Corinthians it arose from the idea of a letter of commendation; that is, Paul is questioned as to whether he should not have a letter of commendation, but he shows he did not need it, because he loved the brethren and he showed he loved the brethren in the way he spoke of them.<a name=353:8></a> So much did he love them that they were written on his heart as suggestive of the high priest's breastplate; and if any brother has a heart like that with the names of the saints written on it, he does not need a letter of commendation.<a name=353:9></a> So it is a question of fitting the saints in the way of love for ascent.<a name=353:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=353:13></a> I think that is the most important thing, the Lord taking them in hand.<a name=353:14></a> He took their feet in His hands and He said, "If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me", so the change is by the Lord the Spirit.<a name=353:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=354:2></a> Well, I think that fits nicely, it is really a question of spiritual power.<a name=354:3></a> And so here it says (in verse 9), "Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel went up" -- they are doing it themselves, and what may be helpful to us is to point out that after they go up and after they see the God of Israel and after they had eaten and drunk in liberty before Him owned as nobles, stress is laid on Moses going up by himself, to bring out, I suppose, the personal dignity of Christ.<a name=354:4></a> Joshua is mentioned, but he is only his minister.<a name=354:5></a> You have the actual mountain now mentioned; it is mentioned earlier but only to build the pillars at the foot of it, but now you have the actual mountain mentioned several times.<a name=354:6></a> "Jehovah said to Moses, Come up to me into the mountain, and be there" -- that is the mediator.<a name=354:7></a> Then we have later the glory of Jehovah and Moses going up (verses 15 - 18).<a name=354:8></a> Now that is, to my mind, very remarkable because in the idea of ascending there is nothing said about where they are going as to a place, it is the idea of going up and worshipping, it is a spiritual matter; but in the case of Christ He is in the place, it is His proper place personally.<a name=354:9></a> But they go up and they see the God of Israel -- it is just going up in regard of the elders.<a name=354:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=359:3></a> The first one would be preliminary, I should think, their preliminary call out of their ordinary vocations -- a matter, of course, that enters into what is before us, what our several vocations may be, whether we are ready to make Christ's service first, or whether it may be just a sideline while we go on with our ordinary affairs.<a name=359:4></a> I think the verses would mean that Christ is influential enough in His first approach to move them, bringing out the kind of material that He was selecting.<a name=359:5></a> Chapter 3 would show, I think, they had been with Him a certain time, they are now to be chosen in relation to one another on the elevation of the mountain and in order to be with Him, I would assume, together.<a name=359:6></a> So that in the ministry there is no independency of thought.<a name=359:7></a> I think the verses read in chapter 3 contain a great principle: we may have been chosen in different countries or at different times even, but this great principle must dominate all the service and every servant, namely, that we are called in relation to each other.<a name=359:8></a>

		J.T.<a name=359:12></a> The family thought enters into the relation of servants one to another.<a name=359:13></a> The levites were a family subdivided into three; in Joshua they are heavenly and the custodians of the grace of heaven in relation to cities of refuge, so that the clerical idea is wholly excluded.<a name=359:14></a> If we bring in the levitical side, it is a family and from the standpoint of training, we are called in relation to one another, called by the word of Christ -- "whom he himself would" -- but in relation to one another.<a name=359:15></a> It seems obvious that the idea is that the twelve might be with Him that He might send them out, so that each would know the

	<div class="paragraph">
		The next passage we read, in John, would seem to bring out the presidency, as I may say, of the Spirit, for in truth the thought is there, the word 'Comforter' would carry it, One who is in charge of us, and the idea is that He guides us into all the truth.<a name=361:3></a> So that in our services together, as we are now, the Spirit is here and would take charge of all that is said; the sense of His presence and function, I think, would in itself promote unity, the desire to have the truth.<a name=361:4></a> He guides, it says, "When <i>he</i> is come, the Spirit of truth, he shall guide you into all the truth".<a name=361:5></a> A very important word, I think -- all the truth -- and very encouraging.<a name=361:6></a> It is a word of great hopefulness as to the truth, that even difficult problems may be solved in the Spirit, the recognition of the Comforter and each recognising what another says, the Spirit would give an ultimate setting to all and make it the truth, for He is the Spirit of truth.<a name=361:7></a> It is a remarkable designation, the Spirit of truth, not only what is said, but the spirit in which things are said.<a name=361:8></a>

		J.T.<a name=378:8></a> Yes, the conditions are there for the service to begin.<a name=378:9></a> We are to have rich thoughts in our minds as we sit together; chapters 21 - 23 suggesting our relationships in the land are to bring in enrichment, like the level of Colossians and Ephesians, so that as we begin over again in the Spirit every Lord's day we may do so wealthily.<a name=378:10></a>
