		THE ASSEMBLY
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:15">Matthew  16:15</a> - 18; <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#19:1">Acts  19:1</a> - 7; <a href="../bible/SongofSongs.htm#3:6">Song of Songs  3:6</a> - 11
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I desire to say a little about the assembly and the features whereby it is recognized, and I have selected the passage of Scripture from the Song of Songs so as to call attention to these features.<a name=1:1></a> I begin with <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>, the passage in that gospel which formally introduces the assembly.<a name=1:2></a> What it is may be gathered from the Lord's remarks to Simon; He says to him, "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona", as answering His question, "Who do ye say that I am?<a name=1:3></a>" He refers to him by the name he bore in his responsibility.<a name=1:4></a> In the corresponding passage in John's gospel, the Lord says, "Thou art Simon, the son of Jonas" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:42">John  1:42</a>), omitting that he was blessed; but in Matthew the Lord addresses him by the name he bore in his <i>responsibility</i>, prefixing "blessed"; he was blessed in that he was so favoured as to receive the revelation about Christ from the Father in heaven.<a name=1:5></a> It was an immense favour, and would stand in relation to Simon in his responsibility while he remained on earth.<a name=1:6></a> No other had that particular favour; others were blessed in other connections, such as Mary, the mother of our Lord.<a name=1:7></a> She was blessed among women; that particular advantage would never depart from her in her path of responsibility here.<a name=1:8></a> Again, the woman who anointed the Lord in Simon the leper's house was specially distinguished, so much so that wherever the gospel was announced she was to be mentioned; what she had done was to be made known.<a name=1:9></a> She had a personal distinction that was peculiar to her, but no one had a distinction like that

		which was attributed to Simon: "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona, for flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens".<a name=2:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have thus a man standing out in responsibility, but blessed; and it describes those of us who form the assembly in its <i>public</i> character, the assembly as seen in us as in flesh and blood conditions.<a name=2:2></a> The truth of the assembly at Corinth is an example: it was composed of men and women, old and young, who had believed in Christ, who had been baptized, and in consequence had received the Holy Spirit, but who were still remaining in their position in this world as responsible to God.<a name=2:3></a> Romans provides the material for the assembly from this point of view.<a name=2:4></a> The believer, in Romans, is Simon Bar-jona, blessed; it is the same person, of the same parents, the same family links, and in the same place; but a disciple, baptized and possessed of the Holy Spirit.<a name=2:5></a> We see in Simon the leper, a name attached to a believer in responsibility in a negative sense.<a name=2:6></a> Evidently he was not a leper then, for Jesus was at his house; but he has been so known, and the stigma attached to him; this would help him spiritually.<a name=2:7></a> But although a leper he was responsible to God, and the fulfilment of his responsibility is, in part, seen in that he entertained the Lord.<a name=2:8></a> The woman of whom I spoke anointed the Lord's head in <i>that</i> house.<a name=2:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Romans contemplates the believer from that angle.<a name=2:10></a> He has his body which he can use as a sacrifice; it is the same body in which he sinned, but by the Spirit it is now in his control; it is dead in regard to sin, but the Spirit in it is life in view of righteousness.<a name=2:11></a> And so he presents it to God a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable, which is his intelligent service.<a name=2:12></a> Believers viewed thus in the aggregate, being "one body in Christ" in any town, are treated as the assembly.<a name=2:13></a> They are still in responsibility, but in a collective sense, and God regards them not only as His people,
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		but as His assembly -- a body subject to Christ, in which the Holy Spirit is free, and maintains what is due to God, and insists upon the keeping of the feast of unleavened bread.<a name=3:1></a> By the presence of the Holy Spirit, His responsible people are God's temple; <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3:16">1 Corinthians  3:16</a>.<a name=3:2></a> Whatever others may think of them, that is what they are, for the Spirit of God dwells in them, and moreover they are the body of Christ; <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:27">1 Corinthians  12:27</a>.<a name=3:3></a> In them the features of Christ are exhibited in any city or place in which they may be; in them the presence of God is known.<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		An exercised person comes into one of their meetings, and there is ministry.<a name=3:5></a> The women are silent, they are suitably attired, and their heads are covered.<a name=3:6></a> The men are in subjection, they wait upon one another, they give place to the prophet because his ministry is the most desirable and profitable, <i>see</i> <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11">1 Corinthians  11</a>to 14.<a name=3:7></a> And so one may discern in that company, in a particular room or building, in a particular street, that <i>God is there</i>, He has a footing among these people; the one who comes in may discern a place where everything is morally right, even the order of creation is not violated.<a name=3:8></a> Now that is what marks the assembly of God, and I take Simon, the son of Jonas, being blessed, as descriptive of those who form it.<a name=3:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the Lord goes on in the passage I read in Matthew to say to Peter, "And I also, I say unto thee that <i>thou</i> art Peter", not that thou shalt be called Peter, as in John's gospel, but "Thou <i>art</i> Peter", and the meaning of the word "Peter", as you all know, is a "stone".<a name=3:10></a> From this point of view Peter does not represent our responsible history, but rather the spiritual.<a name=3:11></a> He is a stone; he was constituted that by his confession; it refers to what he was spiritually.<a name=3:12></a> Of such material the assembly is built.<a name=3:13></a> It is the other view of the truth of it, not what it is locally in responsibility here, although greatly affecting this, but
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		a wholly spiritual thing composed of persons who are so viewed.<a name=4:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now unless we make this distinction in ourselves severally, and in the saints generally, we shall not arrive at the truth of the assembly, nor shall we recognize it.<a name=4:2></a> We shall be liable to regard companies that are not really of it, as of it, and we shall be unable to see how the assembly is to be the eternal companion of Christ.<a name=4:3></a> It is from the standpoint of <i>Peter</i>, that is to say, of what is wholly spiritual, that the assembly is to be the companion of Christ in heaven and the vessel of God's glory eternally.<a name=4:4></a> The responsible side will pass away, for in the new creation "there is no Jew nor Greek; there is no bondman nor freeman; there is no male and female; for ye are all one in Christ Jesus", <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3:28">Galatians  3:28</a>.<a name=4:5></a> It is from that point of view that we form the assembly, as in the purpose of God.<a name=4:6></a> It is an immense thing for us to lay hold of this.<a name=4:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I read the passage in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#19">Acts  19</a>just to illustrate these two features.<a name=4:8></a> You will observe that it says, "While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul, having passed through the upper districts, came to Ephesus".<a name=4:9></a> Scripture is exceedingly accurate in the words and phrases it makes use of.<a name=4:10></a> God was pleased to work in Corinth in an extensive way, whereas there was but little in Athens.<a name=4:11></a> It suggests to us an answer to a question that often arises: Why is it that there is nothing for God in such and such a large centre?<a name=4:12></a> God knows!<a name=4:13></a> There indeed was some result at Athens, but very little; whereas the Lord says to Paul, as to Corinth, "I have much people in this city", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#18:10">Acts  18:10</a>.<a name=4:14></a> Why he had them it does not say, but He had them.<a name=4:15></a> It was not on account of the lack of ministry at Athens, for Paul was there and preached there, but he was directed to remain at Corinth.<a name=4:16></a> He had a vision in the night so that he should know the mind of God regarding the work in that city.<a name=4:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On entering Corinth from Athens, it says that Paul found Aquila and Priscilla there.<a name=5:1></a> Now that was not an accident; they were assembly people, representative of the assembly in its local character.<a name=5:2></a> Twice it is said that they had an assembly in their house.<a name=5:3></a> Paul lodged with them.<a name=5:4></a> It says also that they, being tent makers, were of the same craft as the apostle.<a name=5:5></a> Attention is thus called to the humility of the vessels, corresponding indeed with the smallness outwardly of the assembly; there was nothing in it to appeal to the man after the flesh.<a name=5:6></a> It was a question of tents, not great ecclesiastical structures, as in the world.<a name=5:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is the introduction to Corinth; and the apostle remains there eighteen months, ministering the word of God.<a name=5:8></a> It was a question, really, of the antitype of the tabernacle, and so he ministered "the word of God".<a name=5:9></a> The tabernacle is that in which God is known in this world, and so it was the word of <i>God</i>.<a name=5:10></a> At Ephesus it was more the word of <i>the Lord</i>.<a name=5:11></a> Paul leaves Corinth and goes to Ephesus with Aquila and Priscilla, and leaving them there he goes to Jerusalem.<a name=5:12></a> Presently Apollos arrives at Ephesus, and is instructed in the way of God more exactly by Aquila and Priscilla.<a name=5:13></a> They did not do this in a public way; they took him to them.<a name=5:14></a> The perfecting of his instruction was important, for he was a great vessel.<a name=5:15></a> Now we are told that Apollos was at Corinth -- having left Ephesus commended by the brethren.<a name=5:16></a> He was there in regard to the responsible body; and being mighty in the Scriptures, his ministry watered the saints, and thus promoted the growth of that which Paul had planted.<a name=5:17></a> This represents a continuing ministry for the maintenance of the assembly in its responsible character here.<a name=5:18></a> It was while Apollos was at Corinth that Paul went to Ephesus.<a name=5:19></a> The feature of the assembly represented at Corinth was being cared for by this servant; and the apostle was comforted, doubtless, by the fact that Apollos was there.<a name=5:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It says that Paul came by "the upper districts" to Ephesus.<a name=6:1></a> We are now on another line which corresponds with "Peter" -- the spiritual material; for God knew what was at Ephesus.<a name=6:2></a> He did not tell Paul that he had much people there, as at Corinth, but we may be sure that Paul had divine guidance.<a name=6:3></a> He arrived at Ephesus and found certain persons there who were believers, but who knew only the baptism of John.<a name=6:4></a> They represent many at the present time, persons who believe, but have not had a full gospel.<a name=6:5></a> There are many like that, for there is much defective teaching abroad; much teaching which comes very far short of the truth, but there is light in it, and God has respect for those who walk in the light they have; they are true to the light they have.<a name=6:6></a> First of all he asks, "Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed?<a name=6:7></a>" For now it is a question of what is wholly spiritual, and if you have not the Spirit you are not material for the building.<a name=6:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, they had not heard of the Holy Spirit, and he tells them about Jesus, quoting John as saying to the people that they should believe on Him.<a name=6:9></a> "And when they heard that, they were baptized to the name of the Lord Jesus".<a name=6:10></a> They were ready for fresh light.<a name=6:11></a> I commend that to all here; if you have been true to the light you have, you will be ready for something fresh; you will not refuse it, you will accept it.<a name=6:12></a> They accepted what Paul said to them, and were baptized to the name of the Lord Jesus.<a name=6:13></a> This would take them wholly out of the world, and would introduce them to all that was set forth in that name.<a name=6:14></a> I cannot tell you all that Paul said to them, but elsewhere he says, "Having heard the word of the truth, the glad tidings of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, ye have been sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:13">Ephesians  1:13</a>.<a name=6:15></a> You may be sure that a touch of what is heavenly was conveyed to them in that gospel; there was something in it of the gospel of the glory as well

		as the gospel of their salvation, for in the epistle to the Ephesians, salvation means not only from wrath to come and the power of Satan, but also from this world as a <i>place</i>.<a name=7:1></a> Then there were twelve men who evidently received the Holy Spirit together; and thus, potentially, there was spiritual material for the assembly at Ephesus.<a name=7:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I go one point further to show the bearing of all this.<a name=7:3></a> In writing to them the apostle says, "Ye are no longer strangers and foreigners, but ye are fellow-citizens of the saints, and of the household of God, being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the cornerstone", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:19">Ephesians  2:19</a>, 20.<a name=7:4></a> I want you to take note of the place "Jesus Christ himself" has in this structure: <i>Himself</i> -- it is very touching, especially in these last days.<a name=7:5></a> I take it that the foundation of the apostles and prophets, refers to their ministry; it was not for show -- foundations are not for show.<a name=7:6></a> The apostles never made a show of what they were doing, but their service always afforded testimony for God; what they were concerned about in laying the foundation was solidity and permanency -- material that would stand.<a name=7:7></a> It is a great tribute to them that the Holy Spirit says that the structure was on <i>their</i> foundation.<a name=7:8></a> But what about the corner stone, "Jesus Christ himself" -- <i>that</i> is to be seen!<a name=7:9></a> Christ is known in the assembly.<a name=7:10></a> It is said in connection with the virtuous woman in <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#31">Proverbs  31</a>, "Her husband is known in the gates"; she is a type of the assembly.<a name=7:11></a> The idea of the corner stone suggests what is seen; it binds all together and is ornamental.<a name=7:12></a> What it means to a spiritual person is, that Christ is everything to him -- that he thinks of Christ as "Jesus Christ <i>himself</i>!<a name=7:13></a>" There is no mediator between Christ and the assembly, "Jesus Christ himself being the corner-stone".<a name=7:14></a> In keeping with this, the heavenly city has no temple; God and the Lamb are the temple there.<a name=7:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I go on to the Song of Songs, to outline these features.<a name=8:2></a> The question is asked,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<blockquote>"Who is this, [she] that cometh up from the wilderness <br>Like pillars of smoke .<a name=8:3></a>.<a name=8:4></a>.<a name=8:5></a> ?<a name=8:6></a>" </blockquote>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not here, "Leaning upon her beloved", as later, in chapter 8: 5; it is a question here of herself, what she is as the subject of the work of God, what she is as spiritual.<a name=8:7></a> What are these "pillars of smoke?<a name=8:8></a>" They indicate, I think, that she had to do with God, that she had offered sacrifices.<a name=8:9></a> I suppose the allusion is to the smoke of the sacrifices on the altar in the tabernacle.<a name=8:10></a> But she is not soiled by it nor by the defilement of the wilderness.<a name=8:11></a> She is not damaged by it; on the contrary, she is

	<div class="paragraph">
		<blockquote> "Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, <br>With all powders of the merchant".<a name=8:12></a> </blockquote>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		She does not bear a mark of the wilderness, but is perfumed.<a name=8:13></a> She is not a child of the wilderness like Hobab, who preferred to stay there.<a name=8:14></a> She has come out herself; it is not a question of Moses supporting her, she is coming out herself.<a name=8:15></a> She comes up answering perfectly to Christ,

	<div class="paragraph">
		<blockquote> "Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, <br>With all powders of the merchant".<a name=8:16></a> </blockquote>

	<div class="paragraph">
		She has acquired all this at a price; it is a question here of what <i>she</i> is, what <i>she</i> has acquired, and that all is for Christ.<a name=8:17></a> And now Christ has something that He can call His <i>own</i>.<a name=8:18></a> "Behold his couch, Solomon's own".<a name=8:19></a> He is restful where these conditions are.<a name=8:20></a> The virtuous woman in Proverbs had much, but all was to glorify her husband; everything there indicated what <i>he</i> was; and so we get here, "Behold his couch,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=9>[Page 9]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Solomon's own".<a name=9:1></a> That principle began at Pentecost, when nobody called anything he had his own; it was a question as to what was at the disposal of Christ.<a name=9:2></a> Am I at the disposal of Christ?<a name=9:3></a> The more spiritual I am, the more I am at His disposal.<a name=9:4></a> The assembly is Christ's -- something that He can regard as His own; "My assembly", as He says.<a name=9:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there are men of war to defend that.<a name=9:6></a> They were expert in war, threescore of them round about Solomon's couch, each having a sword.<a name=9:7></a> The idea is collective; the number is given, but <i>each</i> has his sword.<a name=9:8></a> <i>Each</i> is ready for alarm in the night.<a name=9:9></a> They are expert; if an alarm is sounded, they are ready to defend what belongs to Christ.<a name=9:10></a> Of the assembly it is said, that hades' gates shall not prevail against it.<a name=9:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And now Solomon, that is Christ, is free to provide something for Himself.<a name=9:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<blockquote> "King Solomon made himself a palanquin <br>Of the wood of Lebanon".<a name=9:13></a> </blockquote>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are now on a high plane, for it is a question of the dignity of the saints, as indicated in the wood of Lebanon.<a name=9:14></a> He made it for himself.<a name=9:15></a> No doubt it refers to that on which he is borne by others, but <i>he</i> made it.<a name=9:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<blockquote> "Its pillars he made of silver, <br>Its support of gold".<a name=9:17></a> </blockquote>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And now instead of someone coming up out of the wilderness, there are "the daughters of Jerusalem"; they are not daughters of the wilderness.<a name=9:18></a> Many of us come into fellowship, who have barely escaped from the world, and are content to remain in the wilderness; such do not want to go into Canaan -- to take up the heavenly calling.<a name=9:19></a> "The midst thereof was paved with love", we are told, not for the daughters of Jerusalem, but <i>by</i> or "from" them, as the better

		rendering puts it; it was what <i>they</i> were doing.<a name=10:1></a> Paving is severe work; you have to get <i>down</i> to pave.<a name=10:2></a> They paved with <i>love</i> -- what fine material that is!<a name=10:3></a> And then there is the appeal to the daughters of Zion, "Go forth, daughters of Zion".<a name=10:4></a> Thus we move from the wilderness to the full purpose of God.<a name=10:5></a> Of ourselves it is said, "Ye have come to mount Zion", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:22">Hebrews  12:22</a>.<a name=10:6></a> It is the principle of sovereign mercy on which we stand, as we read, "God, being rich in mercy, because of his great love wherewith he loved us .<a name=10:7></a>.<a name=10:8></a>.<a name=10:9></a> has raised us up together, and has made us sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:4">Ephesians  2:4</a>, 6.<a name=10:10></a> Zion represents sovereign selection; God refers to it in that way: "Here will I dwell, for I have desired it", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#132:14">Psalm  132:14</a>.<a name=10:11></a> There is nothing safer than to fall back on the sovereign mercy of God.<a name=10:12></a> He loves us to be in that position, and He loves to recognise us in it.<a name=10:13></a> It is there we get <i>great love</i> and <i>rich mercy</i>, and in the light and enjoyment of these we are, so to speak, "daughters of Zion".<a name=10:14></a> A daughter signifies a subjective result of the light presented.<a name=10:15></a> The daughters of Zion are called upon to go forth; it says,

	<div class="paragraph">
		<blockquote> "Go forth, daughters of Zion, And behold King Solomon <br>With the crown wherewith his mother crowned him <br>In the day of his espousals, And in the day of gladness of his heart".<a name=10:16></a> </blockquote>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this refers to the affectionate recognition in the saints of the official glory of Christ.<a name=10:17></a> "His mother" no doubt alludes to Israel as brought to this in a future day.<a name=10:18></a> The action of the woman in the house of Simon the leper foreshadows this; she anointed the Lord's head.<a name=10:19></a> She, however, represents more, prefiguring those who form the assembly.<a name=10:20></a> The

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=26:1></a> I think John presents the assembly from the spiritual point of view; that is, what the assembly is as formed by the Spirit, and its inner privileges; whereas Corinthians presents it in its external character as that in which the divine order is seen here in this world; so that the apostle makes a point of what the outer world might see in the assembly.<a name=26:2></a> Therefore he says -- "Let all things be done decently and in order".<a name=26:3></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=26:6></a> Yes, I think so.<a name=26:7></a> Corinthians is the assembly of God viewed in its local character as that in which divine order is displayed.<a name=26:8></a> In that way Corinthians corresponds with the book of Numbers, which sets forth the testimony in the wilderness.<a name=26:9></a> I think that the wilderness may be divided into three sections.<a name=26:10></a> The first section is what the people under God had known in pure grace, as having been delivered by Him out of Egypt.<a name=26:11></a> Then followed the legal period: that is, the people under law; and lastly, the people viewed typically as having the Spirit.<a name=26:12></a> This latter is prefigured in the book of Numbers from chapter 21 onwards.<a name=26:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=26:16></a> No.<a name=26:17></a> Romans does not give us the collective side, whereas Numbers does.<a name=26:18></a> The book of Numbers is in relation to the tabernacle, and the priesthood, and the Levites.<a name=26:19></a> This chapter 14 of 1 Corinthians gives us the assembly as convened, and shows the order and operations that are there.<a name=26:20></a>

		J.T.<a name=27:1></a> Well, I think that the details will all come in their right place if we see that it is the assembly viewed as established here under the eye of the world, and not the assembly viewed in its heavenly relationship as in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>.<a name=27:2></a> So the apostle speaks of the Jews, and the gentiles, and the assembly of God.<a name=27:3></a> It was a very great thought with God that He should have His assembly.<a name=27:4></a> It could be taken account of as an institution set up here, apart from the world, but in the presence of the world.<a name=27:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=27:6></a> In contrast to that which is purely the work of the Spirit of God, and under God's eye.<a name=27:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=27:8></a> Yes, just so; that is more John's line; he presents the inside view, whereas in Corinthians it is the outer aspect -- what is under the eye of the world.<a name=27:9></a> It is one thing to be here, in this world, under the grace of God; that is the wilderness position up to <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#19">Exodus  19</a>.<a name=27:10></a> It was all a question of pure grace, and a very wonderful period; but then, if God is to have an organization in the presence of the world, there must be a rule; and the collective testimony stands related to the law.<a name=27:11></a> I am not referring to the law now merely as that which brings the knowledge of sin; the law is really a type; it was the declaration of God's rights.<a name=27:12></a> The tabernacle was set up in connection with the law, and the book of Numbers depends on the tabernacle; so that the collective testimony in the types stands related to the law.<a name=27:13></a> What answers to that in the New Testament is the first epistle to the Corinthians.<a name=27:14></a>

		J.T.<a name=27:17></a> Yes; so that this epistle is what you may call "the law of the house".<a name=27:18></a> The order that is spoken of here is not for heaven, and it necessarily terminates; but what we have in the gospel of John is eternal.<a name=27:19></a>

		J.T.<a name=28:8></a> Yes; so that one prominent feature in the temple was the cherubim, not only in the holiest of all, but also upon the walls and upon the doors.<a name=28:9></a> The cherubim, I think, represent God's government; the holiness of God is seen in the seraphim.<a name=28:10></a> The assembly is a provisional order of things filling up the interval between the ascension of Christ from the earth, and His appearing in glory; and it is established in the way of testimony.<a name=28:11></a> That is, God's order is to be displayed under the eyes of men before it is displayed literally in the heavenly city.<a name=28:12></a> So that here, it may be noticed, the apostle is concerned about the impression made on those who are without.<a name=28:13></a> For instance, if anyone came into the assembly and went out again, he would report what he saw inside -- he would have to confess "that God .<a name=28:14></a>.<a name=28:15></a>.<a name=28:16></a> is indeed amongst you"; and he would gather that by observing the order that was found there.<a name=28:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=28:21></a> Yes, the unbeliever is supposed to be able to take account of what is of God there; so that he is convicted; he is impressed that God is there.<a name=28:22></a> I think that is a great point.<a name=28:23></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=29:10></a> The second part of Numbers is not a type of the epistle to the Corinthians, but I think that up to chapter 20 it is.<a name=29:11></a> What we see there is the tabernacle and the people set in relation to it; every male in the camp was taken account of "from twenty years old and upwards".<a name=29:12></a> I take that to represent believers as having the Spirit.<a name=29:13></a> Each was to pitch by the standard of his father's house.<a name=29:14></a> I think the age of manhood has reference to one who has the Spirit.<a name=29:15></a> The age of thirty would allude probably to the effect of the Spirit.<a name=29:16></a> In the book of Numbers what is striking is the order in which everything is arranged.<a name=29:17></a> It was a very great sight to behold a company of that magnitude all controlled in relation to the tabernacle.<a name=29:18></a>

		J.T.<a name=77:1></a> While <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>shows the Lord's affection and care for His own, chapter 20 is the inauguration of the new order of things; and therefore stands on a much wider platform than chapters 13 and 14.<a name=77:2></a> Chapter 20 stands by itself, and what occurs in it being the inauguration of the assembly, is necessarily once for all.<a name=77:3></a> There could be no other inauguration.<a name=77:4></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=77:7></a> I think in its highest character it is; but the new order of things, while necessarily including what God will bring in in the future, proceeds from heaven.<a name=77:8></a> It is not only what is established in resurrection.<a name=77:9></a> The new order of things comes from heaven.<a name=77:10></a> So that in principle, in coming into the company here, the Lord came from heaven.<a name=77:11></a> I do not say He did so literally, but He came to them following upon His message that He was ascending to the Father.<a name=77:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=78:8></a> I think that is rather what He is as Man.<a name=78:9></a> He had carried out God's will here, so He could say, "I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do".<a name=78:10></a> It was due to Him that the Father should glorify Him, and I think His prayer is based upon that.<a name=78:11></a> It was a demand for what was morally right.<a name=78:12></a> But, then, He is a divine Person, and He has title to ascend in virtue of what He is.<a name=78:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		E.J.<a name=78:14></a>McB.<a name=78:15></a> Yes; the idea in chapter 20 is not that He <i>asked</i> to be taken up, but that He <i>ascends up</i>.<a name=78:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=79:6></a> That is how John so helps us.<a name=79:7></a> He shows us, in view of the decline and ruin, that we have to do with a divine Person, so that there can be no defeat.<a name=79:8></a> I think that is the great value of John's writings.<a name=79:9></a> They apply so especially to our own day.<a name=79:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=79:11></a> Is not the resurrection the crowning "sign" that John gives us?<a name=79:12></a> He says, "Many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples .<a name=79:13></a>.<a name=79:14></a>.<a name=79:15></a> but these are written that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God".<a name=79:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=79:17></a> Yes, it was the greatest visible "sign" as to the greatness of His Person.<a name=79:18></a> As a Man the Lord was here in humble guise, and the point in the signs was that the disciples might believe -- that we might really be believers on the Son.<a name=79:19></a> There are a great many christians who do not really believe on the Son; and John knew that; and he wrote to establish christians in the truth of the Son.<a name=79:20></a> He had, in fact, singled out these special signs that we might believe that Jesus is the Christ, and not only that, but that He is the Son of God.<a name=79:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=79:25></a> And there is no possibility of defeat.<a name=79:26></a> One remarkable thing about John's gospel is that it notes the Lord in isolation; and it also throws a slight on what was official.<a name=79:27></a> One of the most striking instances is in chapter 4, where the Lord is seen alone at the well.<a name=79:28></a> It is a most touching scene, and in the narrative there is a slight cast on the disciples.<a name=79:29></a> Why did they all go away and leave Him there?<a name=79:30></a> One would have thought, knowing the Lord, they would have lingered

		J.T.<a name=84:11></a> Yes; it is remarkable that in John's gospel he brings this out.<a name=84:12></a> The historical side in the Acts stands related to the official administration of the twelve.<a name=84:13></a> The Spirit came to them out of heaven, but it does not involve that they were heavenly.<a name=84:14></a> Now, John writes his gospel after all that which is official has given way, and he shows that the Lord inaugurated something quite outside of what is official.<a name=84:15></a> So the apostles are not called apostles here, they are simply disciples.<a name=84:16></a> Our privileges thus, as christians, are even greater than the gift of an apostle.<a name=84:17></a>

		Now our position today is equal to theirs in principle and detail as having this mandate behind it, and that involves the whole teaching of the apostles.<a name=104:3></a> That mandate applies to the present time as having recognized the confusion in the profession around us.<a name=104:4></a> There was no need of it at the outset, but it is needed now, because the position is questioned.<a name=104:5></a> Hence the mandate becomes of exceeding importance -- "the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal, the Lord knows those that are his; and, Let every one who names the name of the Lord withdraw from iniquity".<a name=104:6></a> We can stand in the presence of all our brethren -- if we can only get them to listen to us -- and tell them it is here we stand, we cannot do otherwise, the matter is imperative.<a name=104:7></a> If some do not listen, thank God for those who do!<a name=104:8></a> But as the prophetic word says, "Yet will I gather others to him, with those .<a name=104:9></a>.<a name=104:10></a>.<a name=104:11></a> that are gathered", but it will be a small percentage, a minority, and the feeling of sorrow must continue, if we are with God, as to their delinquency in obeying the mandate.<a name=104:12></a> Nevertheless the feeling of sorrow is allayed by the thought that "The Lord knoweth them that are his".<a name=104:13></a> They may not be aware of it, but we are; it is that which we have in the seal.<a name=104:14></a>

		I want to touch on the letters to the seven assemblies in that relation, for they synchronize with 2 Timothy.<a name=104:15></a> The addresses to the assemblies show that the Lord not only knows them that are His, but He knows where they are.<a name=104:16></a> He knows all about them; He is conversant with all the circumstances attaching to them, whether viewed ecclesiastically or otherwise; hence in the passage I have read.<a name=104:17></a> He says, "Behold, I stand at the door, and knock".<a name=104:18></a> The Lord is not content with simply knowing them that are His, but He is seeking them out, not silently, but

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a comfort to those who know Him, and are sympathetic with Him, but it is also a challenge as to whether we have part in the knocking.<a name=105:3></a> Though the Lord Jesus speaks to the assemblies in this symbolical way, as walking in the midst of them, He is not corporeally there, He is in heaven, but He serves them mediately through others.<a name=105:4></a> As walking in the midst of the assemblies in a spiritual sense, it is through others that He is exercising this service.<a name=105:5></a> That brings exercise as to whether we are in His hands as regards this knocking.<a name=105:6></a>

		The Lord says in chapters 2 and 3, "I know".<a name=105:7></a> It comes like balm to one's soul.<a name=105:8></a> Others do not know what our circumstances may be, and thus we are deprived of their sympathy.<a name=105:9></a> It may be soul trouble, or business trouble, or family sorrow, but the word, "I know" from the Lord is like heavenly balm.<a name=105:10></a> Seven times over it occurs in these chapters, covering all the saints from that time until the rapture.<a name=105:11></a> The first things He speaks of as knowing are commendable things, and this would encourage us, for, whatever trouble souls are in, the Lord says, "I know", and He commends us in things which, perhaps, we may have forgotten.<a name=105:12></a> But then His faithfulness requires that He should call attention to other things; it may be the things that have brought on the sorrow.<a name=105:13></a> We should know what has brought on the sorrow, but He does not fail to tell us what has brought it on.<a name=105:14></a> Others may conjecture the cause, but it is often hidden and known only to God.<a name=105:15></a>

		From <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9">Acts  9</a>I want to show how the Lord acts in detail: Saul representing one whom the Lord would serve, but through another.<a name=107:8></a> We are shown the way of His doing it now.<a name=107:9></a> Saul has to come to it, that he is to learn from other believers, and we also have to learn that way.<a name=107:10></a> There are those who assume that it is not necessary; but let it be understood by everyone here, that you have to learn from other believers.<a name=107:11></a> The Lord will not allow anyone to pass by His people, those who love Him; for in principle, they are the assembly.<a name=107:12></a> Everyone who, like Saul, has come under the direct ministry of the Lord, will be sent by Him into the city, and there it will be told him what he is to do.<a name=107:13></a> This is a very important point to any one who seeks to learn.<a name=107:14></a> There is the teaching, but there must also be the learning, and I must understand through whom the teaching is to come.<a name=107:15></a> It may be humbling to find that I have to learn from persons I regard less than myself.<a name=107:16></a> Thus Jesus tells Saul that he should go into the city to be told what to do, involving that he must learn from persons who were of much less account in this world than he.<a name=107:17></a> It is a salutary lesson.<a name=107:18></a> Saul said, "What shall I do?<a name=107:19></a>" which was right, and the Lord could have Himself told Saul what to do, but He said, "Go into the city, and it shall be told thee".<a name=107:20></a> One would say to anyone in christendom that he has to learn, not from the hierarchy, but from persons of no religious reputation in this world.<a name=107:21></a>

		That is how I understand the Lord would develop assembly affection.<a name=141:11></a> Hence the one who has the breasts like towers, says, "We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts".<a name=141:12></a> She wants to have her little sister with her.<a name=141:13></a> She could teach her how to love, and it is a great opportunity for us of teaching one another how to love.<a name=141:14></a> God teaches us.<a name=141:15></a> "Ye yourselves", the apostle says, "are taught of God to love one another", and it is in this constant exercise amongst the saints of God that the Lord develops assembly affection.<a name=141:16></a> He sees the thing permeating the company, and that is what He is looking for.<a name=141:17></a>

		J.T.<a name=145:10></a> Headship comes in, but I was thinking more of His position in the house and the way saints apprehend Him, and what resources we have in Him.<a name=145:11></a> The gospel of Matthew presents instances in which the Lord took up an attitude in which He could be approached by His disciples, and in which His disciples approached Him; for instance, in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#5">Matthew  5</a>He ascended a mountain, "and when he was set, his disciples came unto him".<a name=145:12></a> I think if we saw the Lord's position in the house, as having built it, and being Son over it, we would take advantage of the door open to us to come to Him, and avail ourselves of the opportunities offered of coming to Him.<a name=145:13></a> We read, "having sat down, his disciples came to him; and, having opened his mouth he taught them".<a name=145:14></a> Then throughout the gospel you find the positions in the house, all of which taken together are intended to convey to us what obtains now in a spiritual way; but I do not think we shall understand what is available in a spiritual way now, unless we see how the Lord was to be known when He was here among His disciples.<a name=145:15></a> In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>reference is made to the

		What I have to say, dear brethren, refers to the word "among", having in view how each is to be among his brethren.<a name=159:1></a> It will be recalled that the Lord said of Himself, that He was among the disciples "as the one that serves".<a name=159:2></a> He is the model for us.<a name=159:3></a> Indeed it is said in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:13">Ephesians  4:13</a> "until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at the full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ": and the apostles recognizing this, in selecting the one to take the room or fill the office from which Judas fell, stipulated that it was to be one who had companied with them during all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among them, from the baptism of John until the day in which He was taken up; showing that the one who is to serve in the exalted capacity of an apostle, should be acquainted with the Lord's manner as coming in and going out amongst His disciples, amongst His own.<a name=159:4></a> There was to be in his service, as in the service of the others, a reflection of the fulness of what shone out in Christ even in coming in and going out amongst His own.<a name=159:5></a> And so the apostle in writing to Rome before he visited the place, speaks to them in this individual manner, singling them out, "every one that is among you", he says.<a name=159:6></a> So that the intent was that each of the saints at Rome should take to heart, how he was among his brethren.<a name=159:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I read from 1 Thessalonians because the apostle calls attention to his own manner as amongst them.<a name=159:8></a> Indeed the Holy Spirit records that in his visit to Thessalonica he went in, as his custom was, to the synagogue; he went in as one among others; so that

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We shall see that this is a practical matter because each of us has to take account of himself not simply as belonging to the company but as <i>among</i> others.<a name=160:3></a> He does belong to the company, but he has to single himself out in this respect as among the saints, as to how he behaves, and what he is amongst them.<a name=160:4></a> Hence the apostle, in opening up this matter, speaks not formally as in authority but according to <i>the grace given</i> to <i>him</i>.<a name=160:5></a> So that in service it is according to the grace given to one, and that means that one has not only power as having received authority and gift, but because of one's character arising from his spiritual formation.<a name=160:6></a> So the exhortation is "to every one that is among you, not to have high thoughts above what he should think".<a name=160:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what I have to say leads up to the truth of the body.<a name=160:8></a> The passage continues that as in a body we have many members, thus "we, being many, are one body in Christ".<a name=160:9></a> That is the setting of the truth of the body in Romans.<a name=160:10></a> It is a question of delivering us from the principles that govern other bodies.<a name=160:11></a> There are other bodies in the world, such as Free Masons, Good Templars, Foresters and various political societies, bound under certain rules; but in no case can any of these be called a body in Christ.<a name=160:12></a> They are bodies in the sense of being bound together under certain rules and principles, but in no case can any one of them be called "one body in Christ", even though held in so well by principles or influences that there is no schism.<a name=160:13></a> Of only one set of

		people can it be said that they are one body in Christ, and that body is indicated in this passage where each begins thinking of himself soberly so as to be wise, as God has dealt to each a measure of faith.<a name=161:1></a> That is to say, one is in the faith realm, and in that realm each has a measure that is appointed by God.<a name=161:2></a> We have to do with the God of measure, and therefore one's own will, and every other will, is shut out.<a name=161:3></a> It is a question of the measure divinely given to each, and we must recognize this if we are to be in God's realm.<a name=161:4></a> God determines the measure.<a name=161:5></a> He is said to be the God of several things, one of them is measure, and that shows how important the matter is.<a name=161:6></a> The physical system necessarily depends upon the principle of measure, in distance, weight and capacity.<a name=161:7></a> If the universe is to hold as it does and fulfil the will of God, this must enter into it.<a name=161:8></a>

		Now the same principle must enter into the great moral system into which we have been brought: a realm that is governed by this principle of measure; and it is not promiscuous or general, merely, it applies in detail: "as God has dealt to each a measure of faith".<a name=161:9></a> Here you will observe that it is not a measure of gift, as in Ephesians, although that idea enters into it, but it is a measure of faith, which must apply to every one in the body.<a name=161:10></a> It is not a sight system or body, but a faith system, and so God regulates it initially in this way, by giving to each a measure.<a name=161:11></a> Each in the body -- I am now using the word "body" in the sense of a company, for I apprehend that is the force of it here, the initial idea -- everyone has to regard himself in a sober manner as among his brethren, according to the measure of faith which God has given to him.<a name=161:12></a> It may take time, but the grace given at the outset is that which directs the heart to God, and I have to learn from God what my measure is.<a name=161:13></a> It is a question of what God gives, "as God has dealt to each a

		You can see thus, dear brethren, how this element of faith in each of us tends to make the company of christians in any locality spiritual.<a name=163:11></a> It diverts from what is material; though he thinks of what is material, it is in a spiritual way, on the principle of faith.<a name=163:12></a> It makes the company spiritual, and each one among them serves.<a name=163:13></a> He looks on them now, as the apostle goes on to say, according to the figure of the human body.<a name=163:14></a> Perhaps we know less about our bodies than we know about anything.<a name=163:15></a> They are fearfully and wonderfully made.<a name=163:16></a> God alone knows them.<a name=163:17></a> The body is said to be curiously wrought in the lower parts of the earth.<a name=163:18></a> But it is brought in here as symbolic, figurative of believers.<a name=163:19></a> As I reckon soberly, and according to the measure of faith, I begin to see

		What you see in the exhortation in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12">Romans  12</a>is that Paul begins with what we may call gift, as in the sense of Ephesians: prophecy, teaching, leading and exhortation; and then they come down, and extend out to everyone in the company, as in giving, loving, overcoming evil with good; but the exhortation begins with those who have gift.<a name=165:14></a> If one has the gift of prophecy in any local gathering it is for him to take the lead in showing how this great principle works out, for the young have to learn from the old.<a name=165:15></a> He is to prophesy according to the measure of faith; he is not to go beyond it; nor will he take everything into his own hands, but would make room for others; that is, he gives a lead.<a name=165:16></a> The chapter covers much on this line, ending up with the overcoming of evil with

		It is quite clear that if there is to be testimony and guidance, the divine requirements must be met, and that not only a matter of light, but substantially.<a name=170:8></a> What is to be observed in the book of Exodus, is that Jehovah had entered into covenant, and the covenant was fully ratified between Himself and the people before the requirements of the dwelling were indicated by Him, and not only was the covenant entered into, but certain persons were invited up the mountain so that the divine requirements should be apprehended -- "Moses and Aaron.<a name=170:9></a> Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel went up, and they saw the God of Israel"; it says, ".<a name=170:10></a>.<a name=170:11></a>.<a name=170:12></a> And on the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: they saw God, and ate and drank".<a name=170:13></a> And then Moses is taken up higher and shown the pattern.<a name=170:14></a> It is as if God would have the conditions before proceeding.<a name=170:15></a>

		J.T.<a name=180:6></a> I think so.<a name=180:7></a> Care-meetings are very important, because they ought to furnish eyes for the assembly.<a name=180:8></a> The elders watch for the souls of the saints; and we ought to have a lively look out for any working of evil and any working of good too; all that is brought to the attention of the assembly and the assembly acts on it.<a name=180:9></a> The care-meeting is not executive but investigative.<a name=180:10></a>

		Jude had in mind to write about "our common salvation", but he tells us that instead he felt obliged to write about the apostasy, which is now a matter of history -- past and present: never more so than at present.<a name=264:1></a> This great apostasy, in its malign character and power, was weighty enough to bear heavily upon Jude; but he is filled with buoyancy.<a name=264:2></a> In the closing verses of his letter is a buoyancy that one would seek to have infused into our souls, as having to encounter the very darkness of which he speaks; we are in the midst of it.<a name=264:3></a> As John says in his first epistle: "As ye have heard that antichrist comes, even now there have come many antichrists, whence we know that it is the last hour", chapter 2: 18.<a name=264:4></a> It is a solemn consideration, dear brethren, calculated to oppress our spirits; and we should feel it.<a name=264:5></a> God has great regard for those who feel with Him -- and "the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations" <a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#9:4">Ezekiel  9:4</a>; but then there is an outlet in this holy buoyancy indicated by Jude; it is a doxology.<a name=264:6></a> There is much more of this in the Scriptures than we are apt to think -- this spirit of praise; and it should be ever with the brethren; we should not be behind the Old Testament believers, who had, besides many songs and ascriptions of praise, five books of Psalms.<a name=264:7></a> We are enjoined indeed, as filled with the Spirit, to speak to ourselves "in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and chanting with your heart to the Lord".<a name=264:8></a> <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:19">Ephesians  5:19</a>.<a name=264:9></a> Jude helps in this; he leads with others; and what occasions it is the ability of God to keep the saints from falling and to set them with exultation blameless before His glory -- a very weighty matter.<a name=264:10></a>

		J.T.<a name=275:1></a> We get here the circumstances in which the house of God was to be built.<a name=275:2></a> The previous chapter tells of the great sin of David in numbering the people; God did not permit the building of His house on those lines.<a name=275:3></a> It is not with Him a question of large numbers.<a name=275:4></a> Thank God, He does not discountenance large numbers, but David seems to have had his own greatness in view in numbering the people.<a name=275:5></a> He said, "Number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan, and bring the number of them to me, that I may know it", chapter 21: 2.<a name=275:6></a> It was Satan's suggestion, according to this book, and the great sin had to be dealt with, but in dealing with it God acts in grace.<a name=275:7></a> David acquires the altar, and he had a word of acceptance from the Lord -- "At that time when David saw that the Lord had answered him in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.<a name=275:8></a> For the tabernacle of the Lord which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, were at that season in the high place at Gibeon.<a name=275:9></a> But David could not go before it to enquire of God; for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the Lord", chapter 21: 28 - 30.<a name=275:10></a> The sword had already been sheathed in relation to the threshing floor, so that David is able to say, "This is the house of the Lord God, and this is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel".<a name=275:11></a> He was able to name the place.<a name=275:12></a> He bought "the place" we are told, and now he names it.<a name=275:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=303:1></a> In order to rightly apprehend the assembly and how we have part in it, to serve in it, we need to see how the Lord was with His own during the days of His flesh, and then how He was with them after He died and rose.<a name=303:2></a> That is, what we get in the gospels would help us in our public movements, the movements which come beneath the notice of all who may be present; but what we get after the Lord died and rose, is more spiritual.<a name=303:3></a> Both are essential to our having part in the assembly according to God.<a name=303:4></a> I thought the verses in chapter 1: 1 - 5 would suffice as calling attention to the Lord as having assembled with His own after He rose; and then we see in chapter 13: 1 - 3 how they ministered to Him, this being the first mention of direct ministry Godward, so that they become peculiarly interesting in that way.<a name=303:5></a> If there is one thing more than another that we need, it is to be led on to the apprehension of the assembly in its service <i>Godward</i>.<a name=303:6></a> To make it simple: in the gospels we have the Lord instituting His supper, that was <i>before</i> He died.<a name=303:7></a> Luke mentions much about external order.<a name=303:8></a> It has often been questioned why others were not present besides the apostles; but it is obvious that the Lord wished to have what happened carried down by competent witnesses.<a name=303:9></a> So that Luke being accurately acquainted from the origin as having learned from those who were "eye-witnesses of and attendants on the Word", from the beginning, writes with method to Theophilus.<a name=303:10></a> He tells us that the Lord placed Himself at table when the hour was come, with the twelve apostles.<a name=303:11></a> <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22:14">Luke  22:14</a>, and he tells us what the Lord did, and how in His actions and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Luke also tells us that the Lord was praying in a certain place, and that one of the disciples asked Him to teach them to pray, chapter 11: 1, 2, showing that they learnt how to pray from Him; and then he also tells us that when the seventy returned and told the Lord about the success of their ministry, and how the demons were subject to them.<a name=304:3></a> He goes further and says, "I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven", but He says, "in this rejoice not .<a name=304:4></a>.<a name=304:5></a>.<a name=304:6></a> but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven", chapter 10: 20.<a name=304:7></a> Then Luke tells us that He rejoiced in spirit at that time, and praised the Father; so we see in that way how we ourselves are to praise in the assembly, and what we are to do and say, how we are to pray and praise -- we learn all these things from the Lord; at least they did, and being witnesses, as Luke tells us, they passed them down to us.<a name=304:8></a>

		J.T.<a name=384:4></a> Yes.<a name=384:5></a> The point in Corinthians is, God's assembly in that city -- "The assembly of God which is in Corinth", although they are called Corinthians formally in the 2nd letter, chapter 6, verse 11, and that is to be noted too -- but what is stressed is that it was <i>God's</i> assembly in the place.<a name=384:6></a> But here it is "the assembly of Thessalonians in God the Father", not so much in the place, but that they were really of the assembly, being Thessalonians, and that they were in God the Father.<a name=384:7></a> The Corinthians had a much longer time in which to be formed, they had eighteen months of the apostle's ministry, whereas these people were not so favoured, and had only twenty-one days of it.<a name=384:8></a> After the apostle left, there was evident decline at Corinth, but those at Thessalonica got on wonderfully, though the next letter would rather show that there was decline here too, but it was not so serious as at Corinth.<a name=384:9></a>

		These scriptures speak of the place the Lord Jesus has in the house of God, summed up in the passage in the Hebrews which speaks of Him as "a great priest over the house of God".<a name=418:1></a> I wish to dwell on these passages with the thought in view that we, as the Lord may help us, may be encouraged to draw near to God.<a name=418:2></a> "God is in heaven", we are told, "and thou upon earth", <a href="../bible/Ecclesiastes.htm#5:2">Ecclesiastes  5:2</a>, but that is not because He wishes to put a distance between Himself and us.<a name=418:3></a> He has found a means of drawing near to us, and correspondingly of our drawing near to Him, as we see in Jacob, in connection with whom we, have the house of God introduced.<a name=418:4></a> We see in the ladder the divine thought of communication: the idea of the ladder would be ridiculous in the eyes of the mere astronomer, but it is perfectly intelligible to faith.<a name=418:5></a> Faith understands where the astronomer cannot understand.<a name=418:6></a> So God would indicate to us that He wishes us near to Him; not simply as having been brought near from His own side, but that we should draw near from our side, that we should think it worth while to do so.<a name=418:7></a> He says, "I have borne you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#19:4">Exodus  19:4</a>; but then in the presence of that, He inaugurated a system at mount Sinai in relation to which His people were to draw near from their side, and to draw near not empty but full, for He says, "none shall appear before me empty", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#34:20">Exodus  34:20</a>.<a name=418:8></a>

		faith was seen in him; and before we can understand the house of God, we must understand the household of faith.<a name=419:1></a> The types are largely for young believers; they may seem difficult, but as soon as we recognize the Spirit, and consider what is said, the Lord gives us understanding and the types become wonderful; the things of God which seemed distant otherwise, are brought very near to the eye in the types; so that we peculiarly learn "in part" from the types, but we learn and know how to put the parts together, for that is one great feature of the initial history of the christian -- to know how to put things together.<a name=419:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The household of faith is wisely introduced in Scripture before the house of God; and indeed the father of believers is introduced even earlier, his name "Abram" signifying "high father"; that is to say, the suggestion is that his family should be brought up on principles morally greater than the principles of this world.<a name=419:3></a> And then later, he is called Abraham, the "father of a multitude", meaning that he is qualified to be that.<a name=419:4></a> So that the epistle to the Romans prepares the believer for the household of faith: it tells us that Abraham is the father of all believers.<a name=419:5></a> That is an initial thought, but an important one for the christian, that, believing in the Lord Jesus, he is brought into, and regarded by heaven as in, the household of faith; that is to say, he is where people look at things on that principle.<a name=419:6></a>

		The astronomers do not, nor do any scientific men as such, look at things on the principle of faith, whereas all believers do; beginning even with the creation therefore they really know more, at least from the divine standpoint, than the scientific men.<a name=419:7></a> That ought to appeal to every one, especially to young ones.<a name=419:8></a> We are brought into a family that is governed by that principle; not simply having faith for one's righteousness and salvation, but faith in

	<div class="paragraph">
		So the first point in regard of these scriptures, is that in the household of faith -- in Abraham's house -- there is an overseer.<a name=420:5></a> He is first alluded to, as you will recall, by name: Eliezer of Damascus.<a name=420:6></a> <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#15:2">Genesis  15:2</a>.<a name=420:7></a> Abram does not refer to him thus to distinguish him, he is simply a son of his house, born in his house, meaning that he was a domestic; and Abram was distressed that such a one should be his heir.<a name=420:8></a> But in chapter 24 the viewpoint is different; we have no name given; it is the steward of Abraham's house, the eldest of his servants, the man that "ruled over all that he had".<a name=420:9></a> No name is given, because, although now we know who is over the house by the Scriptures, the way of God is to bring us to things before we name them.<a name=420:10></a> We have the New Testament scriptures now in which things are named for us, and we may use these names in a very inexperienced way, even the natural mind may take them up; but in the school of God, the principle is, that I learn the thing, I experience the thing, and then I name it.<a name=420:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24">Genesis  24</a>the point is to stress for the young believer that there is such a thing as this kind of overseership in the household of faith, someone who rules over all that is there, over all that Abraham had as the great father.<a name=420:12></a> He is evidently not an austere kind of person, he does not rule with severity,

		but the believer comes to discover in due course, as he believes the testimony of the gospel, that in the household of faith, latitudinarianism and looseness and general independency of thought and action are foreign to this new family into which he is brought.<a name=421:1></a> He begins to see that there is a gentle, but nevertheless definite, rule in it, and also that it is for his good; that, as a matter of fact, the service of this ruler is to discover in the believer what is pleasing to Christ; that he is looking out for something that the Lord Jesus Christ died for, and is putting forth his rule in a gentle but yet definite way to bring that to light.<a name=421:2></a> He is over all the house -- all that Abraham has -- and he is concerned about what is dear to Christ.<a name=421:3></a> That is his particular business in chapter 24, and he carries out his service admirably and most successfully.<a name=421:4></a> If we give him place, he will discover in us, and give us to understand that there is in us something very pleasing to Christ; and it is a great day for the soul when the thought comes into it, that there is something there that is pleasing to the Lord.<a name=421:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So this steward of Abraham's house undertakes his ministry with the greatest care: he understands the difficulties of the way -- and who that has had to do with young believers, among whom we all have had our part, does not well know the difficulty of getting at what belongs to Christ in them, at what He cherishes?<a name=421:6></a> Now that is the ministry of this steward of Abraham's house in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24">Genesis  24</a>.<a name=421:7></a> You will observe that Abraham is very old here, whereas the person to be sought out was to be young; and the steward is old, too, but he has got universal sway in the household of faith; the older the better so long as he has his faculties, and this steward had his faculties and knew exactly the difficulties he had to contend with in his mission; but he overcomes them, not in a harsh way, but in a careful, calculating way and on the principle of dependence on God.<a name=421:8></a>

		What a fine thing it is to come in contact with this experienced element in the house, marked by dependence on God, and yet persistently seeking out that which Christ cherishes.<a name=422:1></a> The Lord has bought the field as we know, according to the parable, because of the treasure in it, and has also bought the pearl.<a name=422:2></a> He has bought the field in relation to the treasure, and His eye scans it to discover the treasure, so that He might have it free from all admixture and encumbrance.<a name=422:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that is the idea in this type of overseership, of one being over the household of faith; so that the servant is not occupied with himself -- as remarked, his name is not given -- the point is to carry out the wish of Abraham, to secure what Isaac needs; and he succeeds.<a name=422:4></a> The object of his service is young, a maiden, typical of the young believer, but the young believer viewed as the assembly in principle, what the Lord is seeking.<a name=422:5></a> So that this element is active constantly to secure what the heart of Christ is set upon in believers, and he does it; the type shows the end -- he finds Rebekah, so that we might be encouraged that the end will be reached.<a name=422:6></a> The story is well known but it is one that should be studied from this standpoint, as to the bearing of it on the young Christian; so that he sees the wisdom of this old, experienced authority, involving an example for him in dependence.<a name=422:7></a> He sees the wisdom of it in the way it has reached him, and the way it has secured him for Christ, to have part in the assembly; and what could be greater, beloved, than that we should have part in that upon which the Lord Jesus has set His heart, and for which He gave Himself?<a name=422:8></a>

		The next feature of this rule, is in Joseph's house.<a name=422:9></a> It is a bit further on, as to the place it has in the history of the believer, but is of equal importance with the one I have just dealt with.<a name=422:10></a> It is the same kind of rule, but in relation to the securing of the

	<div class="paragraph">
		There are many brethren who take up the terms with little idea of their moral import.<a name=423:12></a> You will all know how the evangelists give us a four-fold view of the brethren (I do not go into them now); it implies moral characteristics and family characteristics, and the Lord is bent on securing everyone bearing these characteristics, and for this there is this principle of a man over Joseph's house.<a name=423:13></a> You will understand, dear brethren, that I am not speaking of the steward of Abraham and the steward of Joseph as referring now to persons: I think I have intimated already that

	<div class="paragraph">
		See how this servant agrees with the mind of Joseph; Joseph directs him to bring the men into his house.<a name=424:8></a> Mark, it is <i>Joseph's</i> house, not Abraham's; it is the house of a great personage, the Son of God in type, who would bring all of us into accord with Himself as His brethren; and this element is subservient to His thought, it is current and active all the time.<a name=424:9></a> For I may add, dear brethren, that, whilst these things work out concretely in one way or another in the Lord's people, they are effected in the power of the Spirit of God; without the presence of the Holy Spirit here in the house, they could not be.<a name=424:10></a> So Joseph directs this servant to bring them into the house, and they are concerned at being brought into the house.<a name=424:11></a> The believer begins to feel that after all, though he may be using the word "brethren" and belongs to them, it may be, he has not realised what it means; and that there has been conduct, and

		I do not say of these men, that they intended to buy the brotherly place, they did not understand; but Joseph did understand, and that is what I want to press on you, that Christ is bent on securing your heart as one of His brethren, and there is this element working all the time to secure it.<a name=426:2></a> If you look back on your history, you will see how it has been working.<a name=426:3></a> So he said, "Fear not: your God, and the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks; your money came to me.<a name=426:4></a> And he brought Simeon out to them.<a name=426:5></a> And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses food.<a name=426:6></a> And they made ready the gift for Joseph's coming at noon; for they had heard that they should eat bread there".<a name=426:7></a> Now this is a lesson that I would commend to all; how beautifully and consolingly this man, this ruler over Joseph's house, spoke to these men, without mentioning his name, but at the same time giving them to know that he knew all about them, and he connects God with them and with their father.<a name=426:8></a> How he dignifies them!<a name=426:9></a> And that is what we need as we approach the door of Joseph's house and enter it, we need to understand how God is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=426:10></a> Presently we shall understand that He is our God and our Father, and that we are the brethren of Christ.<a name=426:11></a>

		instruction in Exodus fits us for the assembly, where we have our place.<a name=427:1></a> Everything is according to measure in Exodus, and as the parts of the tabernacle are set up, each part is functioning; that is to say, intelligence marks the believer as taken up in Exodus, and Aaron is representative of this intelligence, and what comes out is good speaking -- he can speak well.<a name=427:2></a> The history in Exodus shows that Aaron had a way of speaking that attracted people and turned them away from the world.<a name=427:3></a> As the people were about to return to Egypt yearning for the flesh pots there.<a name=427:4></a> Aaron spoke to them, and they turned towards the wilderness, <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#16:10">Exodus  16:10</a>.<a name=427:5></a> Such was the power of his voice, the power of his words.<a name=427:6></a> Who is it but Christ, beloved, now the Priest in heaven, as set out in Hebrews -- who but He controls by His word the hearts of the saints so that they turn away from the world and turn to the wilderness?<a name=427:7></a> Indeed I believe the effect of the epistle to the Hebrews is largely that, a question of the power of priesthood turning our hearts from the world to the wilderness where the tabernacle of God is.<a name=427:8></a> As it says, "We have such a one high priest who has sat down on the right hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens; minister of the holy places and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord has pitched, and not man", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#8">Hebrews  8</a>.<a name=427:9></a> Such a One as that!<a name=427:10></a> It is the greatness of the Priest, and <i>we have</i> Him!<a name=427:11></a> Well, that is the idea in Aaron: the Lord says to Moses, "Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother?<a name=427:12></a> I know that he can speak well.<a name=427:13></a> And also behold, he goeth out to meet thee", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#4:14">Exodus  4:14</a>.<a name=427:14></a> How touching that is as applied to Christ!<a name=427:15></a> He is One who goes out to meet the brethren, takes a long journey to meet the brethren, and when He sees them He is glad in His heart -- that is the idea.<a name=427:16></a>

		Having said all that about Aaron, there are only a few words to be said on the passage in Hebrews.<a name=428:6></a> What you will observe is that Christ is "a great priest over the house of God" as the New Translation reads, <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:21">Hebrews  10:21</a>.<a name=428:7></a> It is no longer only a principle or element, but a known Person set up over the house of God.<a name=428:8></a> The first mention of the house is in chapter 3, where Christ is said to be the Son over it.<a name=428:9></a> Moses was a ministering servant, faithful in the house: Christ is Son over it, but He is over it as having built it: such is the greatness of the house!<a name=428:10></a> It refers to what the Son has set up, and what He has set up He is over; He rules over it, but He rules over it as Son.<a name=428:11></a> And He rules over it as Priest, so that we might know He has full sympathy with us, that we might know there is nothing we can suffer from which He cannot meet.<a name=428:12></a> "Since therefore the children partake of blood and flesh, he also, in like manner, took part in the same, that through death he might annul him who has the might of death, that is the devil; and might set free all those who through fear of death through the whole of their life were subject to bondage .<a name=428:13></a>.<a name=428:14></a>.<a name=428:15></a> Wherefore it

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 4 it says we have a great High Priest -- not yet over the house, but we have Him and in the understanding that we have Him, we draw near to the throne of grace; but the house is not mentioned there.<a name=429:2></a> In chapter 10 it is mentioned, for God would bring us to the understanding of the place we have in it, and that it is ruled over by a great Priest; not only one great personally, but in a moral sense, that He is great enough to get down alongside the weakest of us, and encourage and support us as we draw near to God.<a name=429:3></a> So the word is, "Having therefore, brethren, boldness for entering into the holy of holies by the blood of Jesus, the new and living way which he has dedicated for us through the veil, that is, his flesh, and having a great priest over the house of God, let us approach with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, sprinkled as to our hearts from a wicked conscience, and washed as to our body with pure water", chapter 10: 19 - 22.<a name=429:4></a> That is what God is set for, and Hebrews sets out the furnishings for it, so that the weakest believer should draw near -- and why should we stay at a distance from God?<a name=429:5></a> Think of the service of such a One as this, a great Priest over the house!<a name=429:6></a> He is there to support us as we essay to draw near to God.<a name=429:7></a> It is as we <i>move</i> we get the support; many do not understand how to draw near to God because they do not take the initiative; in drawing near we get the support; He brings us into the very holiest of all.<a name=429:8></a> One is made conscious when first one enters, of his fitness for the place, that he is no stranger there, that he belongs to it, he is of the sanctified company, that "both he that sanctifies and those sanctified are all of one" -- that is the idea of the holiest; we are equal to the place because we are all of

		J.T.<a name=464:1></a> What is in mind is that we should dwell a little on the environment contemplated in these verses, Jerusalem being in view finding a correspondence in the assembly.<a name=464:2></a> We assemble for the partaking of the Lord's supper, and normally find certain surroundings exist which induce praise.<a name=464:3></a> This chapter begins with marked interest in the Lord in Zacchaeus, who, as it says, "sought to see Jesus who he was", verse 3.<a name=464:4></a> Then in verse 11 we have, "As they were listening to these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem": and in verse 28, "Having said these things, he went on before, going up to Jerusalem"; then verse 37, "as he drew near, already at the descent of the mount of Olives" -- all showing that position is in view, and interest in Himself right through the chapter.<a name=464:5></a> They had passed through Jericho, according to verse 1.<a name=464:6></a> What a rich chapter it is in that way!<a name=464:7></a> Although the Lord's death is before Him, for the moment it was Jerusalem's day -- "this thy day".<a name=464:8></a> It was a day in which they had opportunity, and all that enhanced the day is in view in the surroundings such as the mount of Olives, Bethphage, Bethany, and particularly Jerusalem itself.<a name=464:9></a>

		J.T.<a name=464:12></a> Very like it.<a name=464:13></a> The Lord said, "This thy day", verse 42.<a name=464:14></a> The surroundings, especially the city affected even Him; He wept over it knowing what was coming, but it was still its day.<a name=464:15></a> So that it is not Jerusalem in opposition that is in view, but rather Jerusalem in its spiritual significance for the moment, and its surroundings, as calculated to move any intelligent person with Him.<a name=464:16></a>

		J.T.<a name=501:1></a> I am thinking of the subject of the assembly in a general way involving its privileges, and what I think helps to simplify it is that Peter, to whom the Lord was speaking in introducing the assembly, says here in Acts, in view of the choosing of an apostle, that he should be one who had assembled with them during "all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us, beginning from the baptism of John until the day in which he was taken up".<a name=501:2></a> The allusion would be to instances of experiences such as we have now in meetings.<a name=501:3></a> There was the idea of assembling current amongst the disciples from the beginning; it would suggest they had quiet seasons with the Lord and with one another all the time in which he came in and went out.<a name=501:4></a> In coming in and going out amongst the disciples there would be the suggestion with Him of the assembly, which He introduced early; for example in chapter 13.<a name=501:5></a> He speaks about a treasure which a man found, and of a pearl which a merchant was seeking and found.<a name=501:6></a> It is obvious that Peter had in mind that the Lord found enjoyment amongst His own above anything that judaism could yield.<a name=501:7></a> It says in the parable that He found the treasure in the field, and He explains that the field is the world: the Lord was looking at these persons by themselves, so to say, detaching them in His mind from the synagogues.<a name=501:8></a> The Lord was accustomed to enter the synagogues and preach in them, but Peter alludes to something outside that -- "assembled with us", he says: we could hardly think of synagogue gatherings as assembling with us.<a name=501:9></a>

		SPIRITUAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE ASSEMBLY
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=517:1></a> It is in mind that we might consider the assembly from the standpoint of needed intelligence.<a name=517:2></a> The idea of spiritual intelligence is greatly stressed in the passages of Scripture which treat of the assembly.<a name=517:3></a> It seems to be the highest development of God's thought in creation and intelligence is called for; indeed, the word revelation is connected with it, as in the end of Romans where the believer meets it in the ordinary course of his education; it is by the revelation of something hidden, called the mystery, now made known to the apostles and prophets.<a name=517:4></a> And so in Ephesians the apostle also speaks of it as being by revelation to him.<a name=517:5></a> He prays there "that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, would give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of him", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:17">Ephesians  1:17</a> and moreover that the Father might strengthen them "in the inner man; that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all saints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height, and to know the love of Christ", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:16">Ephesians  3:16</a> - 19.<a name=517:6></a> So here it is by revelation; that is to say, it is a state of spiritual ability to receive things in that way, by the spirit of wisdom and revelation.<a name=517:7></a> And so Matthew, in leading up to the great subject, the assembly, records how the Lord had challenged His own: "Have ye understood all these things?<a name=517:8></a>" He had said much to them, and they answered "Yea Lord", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13:51">Matthew  13:51</a>, and he said, "Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old".<a name=517:9></a> That is to

		say, he is a person of wealth, able to contribute in the assembly.<a name=518:1></a> It is from that point of view I thought we might look on the subject linking it on with the Lord's Supper in scriptures that are intimate to us all.<a name=518:2></a> The apostle begins the subject in Corinthians by addressing the saints there as intelligent, "I speak as to intelligent persons".<a name=518:3></a> And so here the Lord brings in the thought of the leaven, counting on their understanding; so that instruction relative to the assembly assumes a knowledge already there, and if it be not there He rebukes us, as He did here.<a name=518:4></a> "How is it that ye do not understand?<a name=518:5></a>" It is for each one of us to ask ourselves if there is anything, 'How is it that I do not understand?<a name=518:6></a>' The Lord is aiming at bringing about assembly conditions and looks for results in the gatherings of His people.<a name=518:7></a> He has become man in order that the most possible might accrue to God.<a name=518:8></a> It is a question of bringing in things for God -- of whom, through whom and for whom are all things.<a name=518:9></a> He says, "My assembly" and He looks for us to understand what He has in mind in it.<a name=518:10></a> It is for Himself, to be presented to Himself, and then in His hand it is for God; it is that in which God is glorified and ministered to.<a name=518:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=518:14></a> To call attention to the danger of leaven being carried over by us as we leave the human organisations around us.<a name=518:15></a> Believers on Him were in danger of carrying over the leaven of the current religious systems represented in the Pharisees and Sadducees.<a name=518:16></a> The same thing applies today, the current religious organisations have leaven and we may leave them but carry the leaven with us.<a name=518:17></a> It says the Lord "left them and went away", meaning it was a thorough departure.<a name=518:18></a> But the disciples might carry leaven with them.<a name=518:19></a>
