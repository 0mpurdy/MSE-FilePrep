		A CLOUDLESS DISPENSATION

		My thought was to dwell on the fact that we are living in a cloudless dispensation, in contrast to the previous one which, as we all recognise, was marked by the presence of a cloud.<a name=1:1></a> The first mention we have of a cloud is, I think, in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#9">Genesis  9</a>.<a name=1:2></a> It is a very simple thought that a cloud has the tendency to shut off the light and influence of the sun, yet in that passage, although there may be the shutting off from the creation of the light of the sun, there is at the same time in the presence of the cloud the testimony to God's faithfulness.<a name=1:3></a> Although the shining of His face -- the shining of His glory in the face of Christ -- was for the moment hidden, there was at the same time the testimony to His faithfulness; that is, there was an indication in the face of the cloud of what was concealed behind it.<a name=1:4></a> Abraham was called out from the midst of the gentiles by the God of glory; that is, glory was in the mind of God in calling him out.<a name=1:5></a> But that glory was to be concealed.<a name=1:6></a> Hence when God takes up the people in His faithfulness, the cloud disappears, that is to say, God's glory was there.<a name=1:7></a> His glory existed, I need not say.<a name=1:8></a> Glory is not an afterthought with God.<a name=1:9></a> Glory refers to what God is in His nature, and His glory was present at all His operations; but in calling out Abraham, God indicated that there should be a particular family in connection with which that glory should be displayed, and in undertaking to bring to pass that which He had in His mind in calling out Abraham, the cloud is apparent.<a name=1:10></a> The cloud appeared even before the people left the land of Egypt, there was the presence of the divine glory -- only God had arranged a means

		of concealing it.<a name=2:1></a> He had arranged His own means for concealing that glory, but it was there.<a name=2:2></a> It was there as a guide to the people, and it was there as a protector of the people: its effectiveness on their behalf was fully demonstrated to them.<a name=2:3></a> And then they were baptised to it.<a name=2:4></a> They were baptised unto Moses, we are told, "in the cloud and in the sea".<a name=2:5></a> <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10:2">1 Corinthians  10:2</a> That is what God intended the people for; they were to be His glory, and they were baptised to it.<a name=2:6></a> They were baptised <i>in</i> it, we are told.<a name=2:7></a> Well now, as thus committed to it, it becomes their guide in the wilderness until they had opportunity to show their appreciation of it.<a name=2:8></a> What I mean by showing their appreciation of it is that they should build something for it, that they should prepare an abode for it.<a name=2:9></a> As we read of David, who fully expresses the sentiments of God's people in regard to His glory, "I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids, until I find out a place for the Lord, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob".<a name=2:10></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#132:4">Psalm  132:4</a> And then he invited Jehovah to enter into His rest, He and the ark of His strength.<a name=2:11></a> Now that was exactly what the people undertook to do in the wilderness.<a name=2:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nothing can be more interesting to us than the wilderness position.<a name=2:13></a> The wilderness is divided into three sections, as I understand it.<a name=2:14></a> The first section has reference to pure grace; God establishes on the banks of the Red Sea an economy of pure grace.<a name=2:15></a> The people, in the full sense of the deliverance that has been achieved for them, celebrate Jehovah as a man of war, and they set out to journey in the wilderness under pure grace.<a name=2:16></a> They murmur; there is no complaint on the part of Jehovah.<a name=2:17></a> The next section has reference to the divine system; the believer is in the wilderness in connection with God's system of things.<a name=2:18></a> A system of things is established here in which divine order is to be displayed, and in which the will of God must be supreme.<a name=2:19></a> That is,

		the children of Israel are here in relation to the tabernacle.<a name=3:1></a> And then, finally, the believer is seen in relation to the Spirit.<a name=3:2></a> From <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21">Numbers  21</a>to the Jordan refers to a people here as possessing God's Spirit.<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The people, now, as set up in presence of the glory in the cloud -- baptised unto Moses in it -- and in the full appreciation of Jehovah as their Deliverer, would build Him an habitation.<a name=3:4></a> You will never effect anything for God unless your heart is established in grace.<a name=3:5></a> Unless you apprehend that God has intervened for you in the Lord Jesus Christ -- in the death and resurrection of Christ, and in the gift of the Spirit -- you will never really effect anything for God.<a name=3:6></a> As in the light of His grace, your heart at liberty in the presence of what God has done for you, then you are able to do something, and the people proposed to build God a habitation.<a name=3:7></a> He accepts the proposition -- He accepts their offer, and they build a habitation.<a name=3:8></a> What I want to point out is, the material was all provided by the people.<a name=3:9></a> Moses did not bring down from Sinai any of the material; all he brought down were the tables of the covenant; all the material for the structure had to be provided by the people.<a name=3:10></a> Moses brought down the pattern of the tabernacle, he brought down the light -- the mind of God.<a name=3:11></a> That is what the apostles did.<a name=3:12></a> The mind of God has been brought to us by the apostles, but you must have the operation of the Spirit if you are to have the material.<a name=3:13></a> As I said, Moses did not bring down the material.<a name=3:14></a> He brought down the light, the pattern of the structure, and the people supplied the material <i>willingly</i>, as we are told.<a name=3:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The people having now supplied everything that was requisite for the building of the tabernacle, everything was formed according to the pattern, and by the hand of one divinely endued with wisdom.<a name=3:16></a> So the structure was made in accordance with God's

		mind, and reared up, and then, we are told, the cloud rested upon it.<a name=4:1></a> That is, God is pleased to connect His glory with the structure.<a name=4:2></a> The delight God had in it was such that He filled it in such wise that even Moses could not go inside the tabernacle.<a name=4:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The glory filled it, but it was a glory cloud.<a name=4:4></a> It was not manifested glory; it was concealed glory.<a name=4:5></a> But the glory was there.<a name=4:6></a> And when we come to the New Testament, when He appeared, He was in His own Person the Tabernacle -- for that was really what Christ was; in His own Person He represented all that God had in His mind to establish -- on the mount of Transfiguration, when Peter would have made three tabernacles: one for Christ, one for Moses, and one for Elias, God, as it were, says, 'There is only one Tabernacle' and the cloud immediately appears.<a name=4:7></a> God intimated that He could not connect His glory with Moses or Elias, as such; if the glory cloud is to appear, if it is to rest upon anyone, it must be upon the Son.<a name=4:8></a> The Son, Christ, is the true Tabernacle.<a name=4:9></a> Under God's eye, He represented the tabernacle in the wilderness, and hence, the cloud appears.<a name=4:10></a> This time it was a bright cloud, pointing, I daresay, to the unique situation; that is, the Son was there.<a name=4:11></a> But with all that, though the Lord Jesus Christ Himself was present, the glory was still concealed; the cloud was there.<a name=4:12></a> It was a bright one, as I have said, but nevertheless a cloud.<a name=4:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Father was within that cloud.<a name=4:14></a> Not now Jehovah's voice, but the Father's voice is heard, intimating the supreme thought in the glory, namely, that God revealed, is revealed as a Father with a Son.<a name=4:15></a> That is the idea of the revelation of God.<a name=4:16></a> "No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him".<a name=4:17></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:18">John  1:18</a> The revelation of God signifies that He is to be known in the character of a Father with a Son.<a name=4:18></a> That relationship was spoken

		of in the cloud.<a name=5:1></a> The relationship was there, but nevertheless it was shrouded in a cloud.<a name=5:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The cloud idea continued until every link was broken with Israel.<a name=5:3></a> The Person of Christ here drew the Father's voice out of the cloud, the relationship was there; but the cloud remained.<a name=5:4></a> And so, as the Lord was about to ascend to heaven, you might say, surely the cloud period is now over, but no, it is not.<a name=5:5></a> There was one element in God that had to be vindicated, and that was His patience.<a name=5:6></a> Hence the cloud still remained, so that when Christ goes up from Bethany -- or rather from Olivet -- we are told, a cloud receives Him.<a name=5:7></a> A cloud -- that is, He is cut off from the view of Israel by a cloud, pointing to the fact that God in patience lingered with Israel, that He would still hold out His hand to Israel, the universal character of the testimony had to be held in abeyance; the full universal display of God's own mind had to be held in abeyance.<a name=5:8></a> So you find that while Christ is hidden by the cloud, the twelve continued the ministry in Israel.<a name=5:9></a> They continued it to Israel on account of Israel's privileges, and while the special national privileges of Israel were recognised, you could not have the full, clear shining of the sun, because if the sun shines full it must influence all the creation below, not a part of it.<a name=5:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#19">Psalm  19</a>speaks about the tabernacle set in the heavens for the sun, and he comes out of his chamber, we are told, as a strong man to run a race.<a name=5:11></a> And the race is the circuit of the heavens, and all the creation below is affected by it.<a name=5:12></a> But if a cloud comes in, there is only a partial shining.<a name=5:13></a> There may be a total cutting off of the sun's light, or a partial shining.<a name=5:14></a> Now I take it that Israel as it stood was itself the cloud.<a name=5:15></a> The recognition of Israel's national privileges, as giving it priority over all other nations, necessarily prevented the shining of the sun.<a name=5:16></a> We all know what an eclipse is, or a partial eclipse, and what I understand

		by Israel's position, as it stood in the early part of the Acts, is that it partially eclipsed the full shining of God in Christ; but God's overtures to Israel, His lingerings in grace, only brought out the wonderful character of His patience.<a name=6:1></a> The patience of God is a great testimony of the Old Testament.<a name=6:2></a> The prophets stand for His patience.<a name=6:3></a> And so His patience lingered in His overtures to Israel through the ministry of the twelve.<a name=6:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, what I wanted to show is that in the ministry of Stephen you have the way made clear for the full shining of the light.<a name=6:5></a> In the end of <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#5">Acts  5</a>you find the ministry of the twelve continued in the temple, and from house to house -- the house -- to -- house character having reference to the activity proper to christianity, but at the same time the link maintained with Israel in the temple.<a name=6:6></a> When you come to Stephen you come to one who is not an apostle, he had not special ministry to Israel.<a name=6:7></a> What marked Stephen was that he was full of the Holy Spirit.<a name=6:8></a> He was full, and if you get a man full of the Holy Spirit there is no part of that man dark at all; Stephen, as filled with the Spirit, was not in any way darkened by the influence of his national relationship.<a name=6:9></a> He was full of the Spirit, and what marks a man that is full of the Spirit?<a name=6:10></a> He is luminous; there is no part dark.<a name=6:11></a> Mat a great many of us suffer from is partial eclipse.<a name=6:12></a> If you recognise a nation or a section of a nation -- if you recognise <i>anything</i> on earth, if you give <i>anything</i> on earth a special preference, there is a partial eclipse; for God has no connection with anything earthly.<a name=6:13></a> I could enlarge upon that in regard to Jerusalem, but all I wish to emphasise is that in the death of Stephen every link was cut with the nation.<a name=6:14></a> And it was the death of one who was filled with the Spirit; in Stephen there was a perfect ministry of the Spirit.<a name=6:15></a> If you get a vessel full, it <i>is</i> full, and Stephen was filled with the Spirit.<a name=6:16></a> And his face shone, it was

		as it were, a full moon.<a name=7:1></a> A full moon signifies that the moon is in the full light of the sun, there is nothing interfering between it and the sun.<a name=7:2></a> Now, I take it that Stephen was in the full light of Christ in heaven.<a name=7:3></a> You may ask, Why with Christ <i>in heaven</i>?<a name=7:4></a> Because the face of Stephen was a heavenly face.<a name=7:5></a> It was not the reflection of any of the glory set in Jerusalem; it was as the face of an angel.<a name=7:6></a> An angel represents several thoughts, but there is one thought that the idea of an angel stands for, that cannot be denied, and that is, he is a heavenly being.<a name=7:7></a> The fact is that the term 'heavenly' is used to designate angels.<a name=7:8></a> We read of "a multitude of the heavenly host", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:13">Luke  2:13</a> meaning a multitude of angels -- praising God at the birth of Christ.<a name=7:9></a> Now, Stephen's face was like the face of one of these.<a name=7:10></a> The cloud has gone as far as Stephen is concerned.<a name=7:11></a> The Holy Spirit had come out of heaven; and Stephen was full of the Holy Spirit and his face shone like the face of an angel.<a name=7:12></a>

		What a wonderful testimony to that council!<a name=7:13></a> There was the servant of Christ full of the Spirit -- <i>full</i> of the Spirit -- without a thought of animosity in his heart; without any vindictiveness at all; he was there in the full energy of the Spirit of Christ, in the presence of the council.<a name=7:14></a> I say what a speaker he was, but what an unappreciative audience he had!<a name=7:15></a> There was not an atom of sympathy there.<a name=7:16></a> There was one of the most perfect addresses conceivable, and it received not an atom of sympathy.<a name=7:17></a> But there he stood, the representative of a heavenly Christ, in the presence of an earthly council -- a council that represented the government of God from the Red Sea onward to that moment.<a name=7:18></a> It represented all that had been deposited in Israel; it had the responsibility of it.<a name=7:19></a> And there was Stephen, the representative of a heavenly Christ, bearing testimony.<a name=7:20></a> And what kind of testimony?<a name=7:21></a> He says, "the God of glory".<a name=7:22></a> That was his text.<a name=7:23></a> He began with God, the God of

		glory.<a name=8:1></a> That is, the glory had been there from Abraham onward (though veiled in a cloud) and Stephen outlines the history, as it were, of that glory in its relation with Israel, and faithfully depicts the inveterate character of their hatred, from start to finish, to everything of God.<a name=8:2></a> Take Joseph, or Moses -- each person represented the activities of the glory.<a name=8:3></a> Although not displayed, although hid behind the veil, nevertheless the glory was there, and Israel refused it, until finally it appeared in the Person of Christ, "Of whom", he says, "ye have been now the betrayers and murderers".<a name=8:4></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7:52">Acts  7:52</a> That was his address.<a name=8:5></a> That was his testimony.<a name=8:6></a> "And they gnashed on him with their teeth .<a name=8:7></a>.<a name=8:8></a>.<a name=8:9></a> and cast him out of the city".<a name=8:10></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7:54">Acts  7:54</a> They stoned Stephen, but then, what kind of man did they stone?<a name=8:11></a> A man whose face shone like the face of an angel; a man who called on the name of the Lord; a man who prayed for them even while they stoned him.<a name=8:12></a>

		But now I want to dwell on the well -- known passage, that he "looked up stedfastly into heaven".<a name=8:13></a> There is no idea of a cloud now.<a name=8:14></a> The cloud no longer conceals the Lord from Stephen.<a name=8:15></a> The cloud received Him out of the apostles' sight, we are told, but Stephen looks right through the heavens, "and saw the glory of God".<a name=8:16></a> That glory in the cloud, through God's patience and long -- suffering, had been with Israel, but is now in heaven, and in the company of Jesus.<a name=8:17></a> "He, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God".<a name=8:18></a> That is what Stephen saw, and he dies.<a name=8:19></a> Stephen succumbs to the stones of his murderers, but the light reflected -- that wonderful heavenly light reflected in his face and in his spirit -- remains upon earth.<a name=8:20></a> There was one standing by, holding the clothes of the murderers, a young man.<a name=8:21></a> God takes up young men; and here was one who was holding the clothes of the murderers

		Now it is most important at the present time that our souls should be established in the full light of the present economy.<a name=9:7></a> The present economy -- the christian economy -- was not properly established until Paul's ministry was fully developed.<a name=9:8></a> Until the link was finally severed with Israel, as I said, there was the cloud state of things where the light was shining, but where nevertheless, it was not complete; there was not the full shining of the sun.<a name=9:9></a> When you come to Paul's ministry you have the establishment of what I call the world -- wide christian economy.<a name=9:10></a> It is a wonderful economy into which we gentiles have been introduced.<a name=9:11></a> Peter admitted the gentiles into the christian system, but now, what was it into which he admitted them?<a name=9:12></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9">Acts  9</a>shows us a heavenly kingdom established in the Person of Christ, and chapter 10, the four -- cornered sheet let down from heaven, representing the mind of heaven -- that the mind of heaven is sympathetic with the whole race of man.<a name=9:13></a> Peter is brought in sympathy with that, and he opens the door to the gentiles.<a name=9:14></a> He opens the door formally, by baptism, and admits them into the heavenly system.<a name=9:15></a> He admits them into all that is unfolded in chapters 9 and 10, and then we have Paul's ministry.<a name=9:16></a> It is very interesting to see that, in opening this subject to the Corinthians, he introduces it in connection with himself as a minister.<a name=9:17></a> What was called in question at Corinth was the minister.<a name=9:18></a> The best possible way, let me say

		Reverting for a moment to the types, there was not only the cloud over the tabernacle in which the glory was, but even when the high priest was admitted once a year to the holiest of all, he had to go in in a cloud of incense, "that he die not".<a name=11:13></a> <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#16:13">Leviticus  16:13</a> That is to say, all that which spoke of God revealed in Christ -- all that spoke of the Person of Christ, the ark of the covenant, and the cherubim, and so on -- all had to be shrouded with thick smoke -- with incense -- with a cloud; otherwise the high priest would have been smitten.<a name=11:14></a> What you now see is that the cloud is no longer required.<a name=11:15></a> "Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh .<a name=11:16></a>.<a name=11:17></a>.<a name=11:18></a> let us draw near".<a name=11:19></a> <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:19">Hebrews  10:19</a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In thinking of the material that is spoken of for the altars in this chapter, there is this particularly, that God reminds His people that He had spoken to them from heaven and that they should not make with Him gods of silver nor unto themselves gods of gold, i.<a name=109:1></a>e.<a name=109:2></a>, there is a suggestion of respectable idolatry.<a name=109:3></a> However respectable the gods may be or seem to be, they are, nevertheless, idols, and to be refused.<a name=109:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God had spoken out of heaven, and had enjoined, early in the chapter, that He had rights over them which were indisputable.<a name=109:5></a> They had seen no form but had heard a voice and they were to be on their guard against idolatry -- a danger which is ever present even as we partake of the greatest privileges.<a name=109:6></a> As God may be pleased to address us in the most intimate way, the danger of the heart being diverted is ever present.<a name=109:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The enemy would suggest what is respectable; that which, in the world, would be regarded as of the first order -- gods of silver, gods of gold.<a name=109:8></a> These are what the enemy would introduce immediately after there has been a manifestation from God.<a name=109:9></a> God had spoken to them out of heaven, but the danger was present, nevertheless, of the heart being diverted by what would pass muster, in religious circles, as being respectable, and the Lord in proceeding brings in the idea of the altar.<a name=109:10></a>

		I have before me, dear brethren, to speak about victory, and you will observe in the first passage read that God gives it to us, the 'us' obviously having reference to those having faith, for spiritual things are given only to such.<a name=111:1></a> God is bountiful in material things and provides for all, even although there may not be faith, for He has never left Himself without witness among men, giving rain, as we are told, and fruitful seasons, filling men's hearts with food and gladness.<a name=111:2></a> Indeed, as the passage goes on to say: "In him we (meaning all mankind) live, and move, and have our being", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#17:28">Acts  17:28</a>.<a name=111:3></a> But when it comes to spiritual things the dispensation of God is said to be in faith.<a name=111:4></a> The gospel is addressed to those who have faith, as it is said, on the principle of faith to faith; it is an administration.<a name=111:5></a> The Lord Jesus Christ, ere going up to heaven, after He rose from the dead, moved in and out amongst His people for forty days, and in that way would impress them with what is spiritual, so that on going on high, being made both Lord and Christ, He administered what was spiritual.<a name=111:6></a> And so Peter says, referring to the gift of the Spirit which was there to be observed: "Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:33">Acts  2:33</a>.<a name=111:7></a> But He shed Him forth upon those who had faith.<a name=111:8></a> He, as shed forth thus, was available to man, but only on the principle of faith.<a name=111:9></a> So that what God gives spiritually, as I said, has reference to those who have faith, and when the apostle here says, "Thanks be to God who giveth

		us the victory", the "us" refers to those who have faith.<a name=112:1></a> As having faith we believe what is presented to us on the principle of faith.<a name=112:2></a> And so, in this chapter, the apostle says at the outset that the gospel which he preached to the Corinthians was that "Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures".<a name=112:3></a> <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:4">1 Corinthians  15:4</a> These facts were presented to them on the principle of faith, and having received them (if they did, indeed) they came within the 'us', to whom God is pleased to give the victory.<a name=112:4></a> And, I may add, so that there may be no misunderstanding as to what this victory implies, that it does not refer to any material success or prosperity in this world.<a name=112:5></a> It refers to what the chapter speaks of; it refers to resurrection, and you will observe that he does not say, 'He shall give it to us', but He "giveth us the victory".<a name=112:6></a> In other words it is a present thing, which God intends should be by faith in the possession of our souls: He gives it to us, and He gives it to us through our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=112:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, the Lord, as risen, remained with His own forty days before He ascended, and, as you will remember, He appeared, according to this chapter, on six different occasions; and I submit to you that on each of these occasions there would be conveyed the sense of victory.<a name=112:8></a> First, He appeared to Cephas.<a name=112:9></a> In the gospel of Luke we are told He appeared to Simon, doubtless to reassure the heart of His erring disciple, but the Spirit of God has not that in view in this passage, and so He mentions Simon's spiritual name.<a name=112:10></a> We have to understand what it is, beloved, to have spiritual names, because it is first that which is natural and afterwards that which is spiritual.<a name=112:11></a> We have to understand how we come under the eye of the Lord, the last Adam who is a quickening Spirit.<a name=112:12></a> If He has to do with us He quickens us; He quickens us in relation to His own perfect wisdom as to the
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		place we are to occupy in that spiritual world which He came to effectuate.<a name=113:1></a> So that Simon is referred to here according to his spiritual name.<a name=113:2></a> This quickening involves certain traits which no one else has.<a name=113:3></a> Each one differs, as this passage tells us: "Star differs from star in glory".<a name=113:4></a> <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:41">1 Corinthians  15:41</a> Each one has his own living characteristics, spiritual characteristics, and, as all come under the eye of the last Adam, He sees these and names the person accordingly.<a name=113:5></a> We shall all appear, therefore, in the spiritual realm according to the names which the last Adam confers.<a name=113:6></a> And so, as He appears to Cephas, there would be in the heart of Cephas a sense of victory.<a name=113:7></a> He would be stimulated in the sense of victory as to what he was and the place he was to occupy in the divine structure, for his name signifies 'a stone'.<a name=113:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then He appears to the twelve, for they were to administer.<a name=113:9></a> There was to be here an administrative company appointed by the Lord, and they had been appointed, and as appointed He appears to them.<a name=113:10></a> The appearance would convey to them a sense of victory, for the One whom they were to represent in their administration was Himself supremely victorious; He was out of death.<a name=113:11></a> Their administration should be not of material things, but spiritual things, and they would be impressed by the appearance of Christ to them as the twelve, with the sense of victory: that they had to do with a spiritual Person.<a name=113:12></a> One who had been into death, and was now out of it.<a name=113:13></a> They would be impressed with victory, and would carry on the administration in the sense of victory; they would be above the least taint of corruption.<a name=113:14></a> We know how administrators after the flesh are exposed to corruption, but these would be set up in their souls in complete superiority in the sense of victory that the Lord Jesus Christ would accord to them as appearing to them.<a name=113:15></a>

		hundred brethren at once; and here again there would be the conveyance to their souls of victory, for how should we maintain the truth involved in the term 'brethren', except as in victory?<a name=114:1></a> We should soon drop to the level of current religion around us unless we are in the sense of victory.<a name=114:2></a> It was as risen from the dead that the Lord Jesus Christ sent the message to His brethren.<a name=114:3></a> He says, "Go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God", <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:17">John  20:17</a>.<a name=114:4></a> "I ascend", He says, and how that would elevate their hearts far above this world, and the earth, and even the garden in which Magdalene had met Him.<a name=114:5></a> They were to be linked up with Him as ascended into heaven.<a name=114:6></a> He came in afterwards -- on what particular date I cannot tell -- but there were five hundred of them together at the one time -- a remarkable occasion -- and He appeared to them.<a name=114:7></a> Some of them, says the apostle, remained until that day.<a name=114:8></a> How those who remained, as moving about among the later converts would convey to those converts the dignity of 'brethren'!<a name=114:9></a> The term has been dragged down in our own times to the current religions in the world, brethren being classified among all the religions of town or country; but it was never so intended.<a name=114:10></a> The Lord's thought was that it should be elevated -- that we should remain in obscurity outside the range of man's cognisance.<a name=114:11></a> And so, these five hundred, as they moved about among the later converts, would impress upon them the spiritual dignity involved in the term 'brethren'.<a name=114:12></a>

		passage in John's epistle, because it shows you how we come into this.<a name=116:1></a> First he says, "All that has been begotten of God gets the victory over the world" -- nothing else!<a name=116:2></a> You may study the Scriptures, and the writings that bear on the Scriptures, and acquire knowledge and ability to speak, but all these suffice not for the victory over the world.<a name=116:3></a> It is all that is begotten of God that gets the victory.<a name=116:4></a> And then again, he says, "This is the victory which has gotten the victory over the world, our faith".<a name=116:5></a> This is not only faith in your soul; it includes, I think, the system of truth unfolded in the Lord Jesus Christ -- the <i>whole</i> of it -- our faith.<a name=116:6></a> On every hand the truth is being given up and abandoned; who are abandoning it?<a name=116:7></a> Those who are not born of God, for those who are born of God get the victory, and they <i>hold</i> the truth.<a name=116:8></a> Later on we are told "the Spirit is the truth".<a name=116:9></a> Christ is the truth -- "I am the way, the truth, and the life".<a name=116:10></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:6">John  14:6</a> That is objective.<a name=116:11></a> He presents the whole truth of God objectively, but in the epistle the Spirit is the truth, suggesting that the Holy Spirit down here, in the believers, maintains the truth in complete correspondence with Christ in heaven; an immense thought!<a name=116:12></a> Can it ever fall to the ground?<a name=116:13></a> Never!<a name=116:14></a> "This is the victory which has gotten the victory over the world, our faith".<a name=116:15></a> It was held in the souls of believers.<a name=116:16></a> The truth was never intended to be maintained by catechism or 'articles of religion'.<a name=116:17></a> That cannot be called faith.<a name=116:18></a> The word suggests that things were held livingly in men's souls, and by the Spirit the truth was held in all its parts, as John wrote.<a name=116:19></a> And it was supremely above the world; it brought down the world, as at Ephesus; the books were burned.<a name=116:20></a>

		God?<a name=117:1></a>" I have already anticipated this: "Our faith" involves every christian -- the unity of the faith -- and wherever it is held in faith -- that is, livingly, in a man's soul -- there is victory.<a name=117:2></a> But then there is the individual thought: "Who is <i>he</i> that overcometh the world, but <i>he</i> that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?<a name=117:3></a>" The word 'overcometh' here is victory; "he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God" has it.<a name=117:4></a>

		I commend, dear brethren, the importance of believing that Jesus is the Son of God.<a name=117:5></a> John presents Him in his gospel, and Paul preached Him as the Son of God.<a name=117:6></a> According to the Scriptures Paul was the first to preach that Jesus was the Son of God; you can understand it, for he had already the appearing.<a name=117:7></a> "Last of all … he appeared to me", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:8">1 Corinthians  15:8</a> Paul said.<a name=117:8></a> "God", he says, "was pleased to reveal his Son in me, that I may announce him as glad tidings among the nations", <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#1:16">Galatians  1:16</a>.<a name=117:9></a> And so the preaching that has come to us gentiles is that; the preaching of the Son of God.<a name=117:10></a>

		As it is individual here one would raise the question with everyone present -- the question the Lord raised with the man that had been blind: "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?<a name=117:11></a>" <a href="../bible/John.htm#9:35">John  9:35</a> You see, John contemplates in his gospel that there are believers, <i>and</i> believers.<a name=117:12></a> He contemplates that many should come under the head of believers, or disciples, and yet not be believers in the Son of God.<a name=117:13></a> Indeed, the man in <a href="../bible/John.htm#9">John  9</a>had already been a believer.<a name=117:14></a> He had witnessed for Christ, and, on account of his witness, had been cast out of the synagogue, and yet the Lord raises the question: "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?<a name=117:15></a>" You see there is a point we have to reach experimentally, when we believe on the Son of God.<a name=117:16></a> And so the man says to the Lord, "Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?<a name=117:17></a>" The Lord replies, "Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that

		Now, I just wanted to point out in the two passages I read in the Old Testament how that the Old Testament confirms, and, indeed, enlarges on the New.<a name=118:16></a> It gives us illustrations, and so, in Habakkuk, you have a victor.<a name=118:17></a> If you go through his prophecy, you will see, at one time he was very despondent; things were not going well, and he is an example of most of us.<a name=118:18></a> We all have our despondent times, up to a point.<a name=118:19></a> I often think that the journey of young christians is, so to speak, undulating -- up and down -- and so it was with Habakkuk, until he arrived at the apprehension of what he speaks of: <i>high places</i>.<a name=118:20></a> He begins with variable notes, but he ends with a stringed instrument; I think it is <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15">1 Corinthians  15</a>.<a name=118:21></a> The choir, I think, is in view of these chapters,

		beginning with the tenth, and when you come to the great truth of resurrection the strings are tightened up, the flesh is disallowed, and you apprehend the Man out of death; you are in victory.<a name=119:1></a> And so Habakkuk says, "To the chief Musician.<a name=119:2></a> On my stringed instruments".<a name=119:3></a> Whatever happened to the vines, or to the figs, or to the herds, or to the flocks, affected him not now.<a name=119:4></a> His business affairs might go against him, his family affairs, or what not, but now he would rejoice -- "I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation".<a name=119:5></a> What is proposed in the gospel is outside of all these material things, and, as apprehended, makes you independent of them.<a name=119:6></a> Not that you do not feel things, but you are not dragged down by them; you walk in your high places.<a name=119:7></a> You see it is when God gives you the victory, and you are in it consciously, that the high places are yours.<a name=119:8></a> The Lord Jesus walked on the high places for forty days before He ascended so that His own might see what victory He had gained.<a name=119:9></a> The world saw Him not -- it was outside of this world -- but His disciples saw Him; He showed Himself unto them alive.<a name=119:10></a> He walked on His high places, but now the believer walks on his.<a name=119:11></a> He walks independently of adverse circumstances, as in the light of victory, in the light of Christ risen from the dead.<a name=119:12></a> God gives you "hind's feet"; you are above the pressure of this world, and you walk on the high places, and God gets His portion from you.<a name=119:13></a> I would that every one of us could use this possessive case, as indicating that we have entered on the high places trodden by the Lord Jesus Christ during those forty days.<a name=119:14></a> As the Lord took Peter by the hand, so He would take every one of us, so that we might walk with Him on our high places.<a name=119:15></a>

		I wish to speak at this time, dear brethren, about spiritual contemplation, believing that it is a real need among us; especially among young believers, the ability to sit down as illustrated in Mary of Bethany is comparatively rare.<a name=123:1></a> In the Canticles the female speaker says, "In his shadow have I rapture and sit down".<a name=123:2></a> <a href="../bible/SongofSongs.htm#2:3">Song of Songs  2:3</a> Sitting down from this point of view, is a posture in which we can contemplate to advantage.<a name=123:3></a> Unless we acquire the habit as believers we shall not shine for Christ, for we shall not take in nor absorb something presented objectively which is seen in Christ.<a name=123:4></a> We all know the influence of atmosphere, how it affects us extremely, how particularly in inanimate things, the influence of environment gives character to them, as for instance, a flower.<a name=123:5></a> "Consider the lilies", says the Lord, "how they grow".<a name=123:6></a> <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#12:27">Luke  12:27</a> They grow in an environment provided -- "they toil not, they spin not; and yet .<a name=123:7></a>.<a name=123:8></a>.<a name=123:9></a> Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these".<a name=123:10></a> Yet they also have to be nourished from the earth, and so it is, dear brethren, that we receive from the earth, for we are to take root downward and bear fruit upward.<a name=123:11></a> The king himself lives of the field; that emphasises that we eat, for in that wonderful description of creation in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#104">Psalm  104</a>, one of the many wonderful things we eat is bread to strengthen man's heart and wine to gladden it.<a name=123:12></a> These have to be assimilated, so that in taking in the word, as Jeremiah did, he said, "Thy words were found, and I did eat them".<a name=123:13></a> <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#15:16">Jeremiah  15:16</a> Ezekiel, too, ate the roll.<a name=123:14></a> In eating the word thus it becomes, as it were, ourselves, as when the Lord says, I am "Altogether that which I also say to you".<a name=123:15></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#8:25">John  8:25</a> There is this, beloved brethren, that we

		I wish to speak about gathering, a thought that runs through Scripture, and one that has a peculiar interest in the gospel of John, which has in view our own times in which the primary force of divine terms and instructions is lost.<a name=128:1></a> Terms which had special significance at the outset have lost their meanings, and have taken on a meaning which man by mere religious training is pleased to give them, and so the people of God have to learn the vocabulary of Scripture over again.<a name=128:2></a> In order that we should learn it in its primary significance we have to unlearn human definitions and discard them.<a name=128:3></a> What John presents to us shows that we have to learn them over again and to learn them from Christ, for He is the model and living expression of everything He presents in teaching.<a name=128:4></a>

		We have such instruction also set out in the early part of 2 Kings, where it is said that Jehovah would take up Elijah by a whirlwind into heaven.<a name=128:5></a> As it was announced, every moment counted for Elisha, in order that he might learn all that was possible ere Elijah's departure.<a name=128:6></a> He would have the living voice, the touch, and the influence of Elijah and specially so in relation to those places intimately connected with the testimony.<a name=128:7></a> Elisha represents the believer, and so in the light of Jehovah's intent, they both being in Gilgal, Elisha moves first and Elijah goes with him.<a name=128:8></a> The initiative is with Elisha in this, realising the necessity of the moment.<a name=128:9></a> Afterward the initiative is with the Lord as represented in Elijah, for He would encourage every desire to move on our part.<a name=128:10></a>

		John takes account of the movement of the Lord in the divine dwelling, with ourselves in it, for in chapter 1 when He saw two disciples following He challenges them as to <i>what</i> they were seeking, and then invited them to <i>come</i> and see <i>where</i> He dwelt.<a name=129:11></a> Never had such an experience of the divine dwelling been known before; the Lord Himself being in it.<a name=129:12></a> We have to learn these things from Christ, and we learn perfectly as we understand from Christ.<a name=129:13></a> So with the principle of gathering.<a name=129:14></a> John brings out in chapter 11 what is involved in the idea of gathering.<a name=129:15></a> There again the Lord leads the way.<a name=129:16></a> You will observe that the prophecy of Caiaphas, the high priest, did not include the thought of gathering; it was light from God, and it reminds us that God may even use a man who is not in sympathy with the testimony, but you will find that such a man will not go the whole way; he is sure to be national in his thoughts, for he can know nothing about the family of God.<a name=129:17></a> Caiaphas speaks about the <i>nation</i> and of one dying for the <i>nation</i>, but the Spirit of God goes on and as

		John, in writing his gospel, is concerned about the children, for the testimony has not taken a national form.<a name=130:3></a> It will revert to that, but it is not a primary thought or continuous, for it will eventually disappear in its national form.<a name=130:4></a> God brought in the national position in His ways in order to meet the conditions that had arisen in the world, but the primary thought of God is the family, the children.<a name=130:5></a> The Spirit of God, therefore, through John adds to the prophecy of the high priest, saying, "and not for the nation only, but that he should also gather together into one the children of God who were scattered abroad", <a href="../bible/John.htm#11:52">John  11:52</a>.<a name=130:6></a> The Spirit of God speaks of the children, hence its application to the present time when the children are so scattered.<a name=130:7></a> The Lord died not only for the nation, but to gather together the children of God who were scattered abroad.<a name=130:8></a> He <i>died</i> to do that, so that as learning from the Lord, we learn the truth of the family over again and learn it completely.<a name=130:9></a> The shepherds of the present time should be feeding and gathering, but if I think of the shepherds of Israel, what are they doing?<a name=130:10></a> If I look abroad on the shepherds of the christian profession, those recognised in the religious systems, what are they doing about the children of God?<a name=130:11></a> I see little concern for them there, so I turn to the Lord to learn it over again.<a name=130:12></a> The official shepherds of the day speak of their own flocks, an unscriptural term, and I have to turn therefore to the Lord to learn about the family and how to gather the children of God.<a name=130:13></a> I learn it first by seeing that He died to gather them; I <i>must</i> learn from Him.<a name=130:14></a> He said, "he that gathers not <i>with me</i> scatters".<a name=130:15></a> How many scatterers

		In this book that pre-eminently refers to Christ -- the book of the inheritance -- the women in these three passages may be regarded as forming links in which are set out what we call the subjective feature of the book.<a name=181:1></a> And when I say 'subjective', I refer to a term that has more currency amongst spiritual people than it has in the world.<a name=181:2></a> It is a philosophical term that is rightly and appropriately applied to convey what God effects in us.<a name=181:3></a> There is that which He has effected in Christ outside of us -- on our behalf -- and then there is that which He has effected in us by the Spirit, which latter is usually presented in Scripture in a figurative way on the feminine side, and so it challenges us peculiarly as to what there is in us which reflects what God has effected in Christ.<a name=181:4></a> He has set out His ideal in Christ as coming here unsolicited, and has set out under His own eye and under the eyes of angels and men His ideal -- what men should be here.<a name=181:5></a> He has taken Him up into the heavens as Paul says, speaking of the glad tidings he preached among the Corinthians, "Christ died for our sins, according to the scriptures; and that he was buried; and that he was raised the third day, according to the scriptures".<a name=181:6></a> <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:3">1 Corinthians  15:3</a> - 4 Christ in resurrection is not only God's ideal as a Man walking here among men, but His ideal for all time and eternity.<a name=181:7></a> In resurrection we have a Man after God's eternal counsels, and it is in that condition, as received up in glory, that He is presented in the gospel.<a name=181:8></a> Paul was so taken up with Him and so apprehended the mind of God that he said, "So that we henceforth know no one according to flesh; but

		So I have taken up these women or vessels as presenting the feminine or subjective side in the book of Joshua.<a name=182:9></a> I refer to Rahab particularly because she presents the initial thing.<a name=182:10></a> She was tested by the spies as to what was there in her.<a name=182:11></a> I speak of her from the references of the Spirit in the New Testament.<a name=182:12></a> James says, "But was not .<a name=182:13></a>.<a name=182:14></a>.<a name=182:15></a> Rahab the harlot justified on the principle of works", showing that she represents what I have been saying, that which is practical and subjective.<a name=182:16></a> She was justified by works, he says, and he confirms that by saying that she received the messengers and put them forth by another way.<a name=182:17></a>

		She received the messengers, James says, which was a treacherous act from the standpoint of the king of Jericho, as is our position from the standpoint of Satan -- not from the standpoint of the king of this realm or of his representatives.<a name=183:10></a> Our position is not regarded as treacherous in <i>his</i> eyes, nor should it be; we pray for him.<a name=183:11></a> But we have no hesitation in being treacherous to the world as it is viewed as of satanic power and opposition to Christ.<a name=183:12></a> So Rahab received the messengers, James says.<a name=183:13></a> They were representatives of God -- of Joshua.<a name=183:14></a> Hebrews says "spies", that is to say, they represent the secret agencies of God -- implying the overthrow of this world.<a name=183:15></a> And so James says, she received the messengers and put them forth <i>another way</i>.<a name=183:16></a>

		I am thinking this evening of divine or heavenly appearings.<a name=228:1></a> These date from Abraham's time according to the well-known utterance of Stephen, who said, "The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham".<a name=228:2></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7:2">Acts  7:2</a> From that point onwards we have continuous appearings.<a name=228:3></a> A most interesting subject as you will readily own, and these appearings imply that the people of God were not simply to be possessed of knowledge and light but that they were to take on of the divine and heavenly character, and that this was to be maintained in freshness; hence the continuation from Abraham right through.<a name=228:4></a> The apostle Paul, as you will remember, specially dwells on the appearings of the Lord Jesus after His resurrection, the object obviously being to impress His own according to the features in which He appeared to them; and this continues in a spiritual way, not in the miraculous manner of Old Testament times, or even of New Testament times, but in a spiritual, but not less real, manner; so that the saints of God should take on the divine and heavenly in continued freshness.<a name=228:5></a> Now this will appear, as you may have time to look into it, in all the typical books, and I might say right through, but particularly in the typical books and those immediately following.<a name=228:6></a> And so I have selected these three scriptures in Judges as illustrative of what I have said.<a name=228:7></a> They present to us angelic or, in principle, divine appearings.<a name=228:8></a> The first is in the chapter I read, chapter 2, and as you might expect these appearings have to do with recovery.<a name=228:9></a> If there is to be recovery from a position into which the people of God may have descended or fallen, it is on the principle of something better than that from which they fell.<a name=228:10></a>

		God would impress us with what is superior -- with superior things.<a name=229:1></a> You will all be conversant with the greatness of the word 'better' in the epistle to the Hebrews, an epistle that corresponds to this book.<a name=229:2></a> It is a recovering epistle and on the principle of there being better things.<a name=229:3></a> To illustrate what I mean, dear brethren, I refer to the gospel of Luke.<a name=229:4></a> You will remember how angelic appearings and communications are stamped on the early chapters of Luke, as if God in introducing the gospel as He does in that book in a unique way, would impress us, not simply with the terms of it, but with the company or realm into which the gospel is intended to introduce us.<a name=229:5></a> The gospel is intended not only to deliver us through the power of the kingdom from this world and keep us from evil in it, but to introduce us into what is heavenly, so that we really need to read Ephesians with Romans.<a name=229:6></a> Luke goes much beyond Romans.<a name=229:7></a> And so, immediately you have in Luke as shepherds were abiding with their flocks by night -- while others were occupied with worldly things in the cities and towns -- the angel of the Lord is there by them as if to say, 'You are here unselfishly engaged with your flock, and we will give you excellent company, we afford you heavenly company.<a name=229:8></a> Others are enjoying themselves, the mass, in the towns and cities; you are here unselfishly and I will afford you heavenly company!<a name=229:9></a>' That is virtually what the angel implied, and then the glory of the Lord shines around.<a name=229:10></a> What glory in any town or city in the world would compare with that?<a name=229:11></a> So that the very best thing, you see, is introduced at once by Luke, what God has for man -- heavenly companionship, heavenly communications and heavenly glory shines round about.<a name=229:12></a> And then a multitude, as it says, suddenly a multitude of the heavenly host were there, and what they were saying!<a name=229:13></a> What could the orations or the entertainments in any city of the empire be compared with what they were

		saying?<a name=230:1></a> Think of the language of angels, the manner of angels' communications, how they would speak and then what they were saying, what was engaging them -- "Glory to God in the highest" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:14">Luke  2:14</a>; that is to say the greatest possible elevation.<a name=230:2></a> What was going on and what is going on in the cities today, as then, is the depths of moral degradation, whereas they were occupied with the heavenly, the highest.<a name=230:3></a> One could say much more about these opening chapters of Luke, but what I have said serves to indicate how God would encircle us not only with heavenly light but heavenly companionship.<a name=230:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, that is the principle in all these appearings, and so what we find in chapter 2 is the movement of the first angel mentioned.<a name=230:5></a> He comes up from Gilgal.<a name=230:6></a> That is a matter of immense moment in view of the conditions depicted in the first chapter.<a name=230:7></a> It meant that the angel said virtually, 'You have gone and I am coming', for God will not give up His people even although they depart from a great spiritual position.<a name=230:8></a> Gilgal was a great spiritual position.<a name=230:9></a> It is indeed, for it is the very key to the position, the holding, the maintenance of heavenly ground.<a name=230:10></a> There were at it the symbols of Israel's unity, not as they came out of Egypt, but as they came out of death.<a name=230:11></a> What we want to see, beloved, is an Israel out of death, as the apostle says, "the Israel of God".<a name=230:12></a> <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#6:16">Galatians  6:16</a> Circumcision avails nothing nor uncircumcision but new creation.<a name=230:13></a> There are those who walk by this law, peace be unto them.<a name=230:14></a> The Israel of God is the spiritual, the saints viewed spiritually come up out of death, as I might say, and come down from heaven.<a name=230:15></a> That is what really enters into Gilgal, for not only are we as the antitype of Gilgal a risen people but a heavenly people, for it is there the reproach of Egypt is rolled away, and they take on the heavenly; they belong to the land; they eat heavenly food, the old corn, what had been there, they take on that and the

		reproach of Egypt is rolled away.<a name=231:1></a> The position was therefore supremely spiritual, but they had left it and God is not going to stay there alone.<a name=231:2></a> Such is His consideration for His people.<a name=231:3></a> He would pursue them, but to a point.<a name=231:4></a> Bochim signifies weeping, as you will know.<a name=231:5></a> And so the angel comes up from Gilgal to Bochim and he reminds them of the love of God.<a name=231:6></a> Why should we move away from a position assigned to us by the love of God?<a name=231:7></a> "I will never break my covenant with you".<a name=231:8></a> God is God.<a name=231:9></a> His gifts and calling are without repentance, but His very love implies that He must be severe, and so in His government, you see, He allows to remain as chastisement what they in their negligence and fleshly feelings and desires retained.<a name=231:10></a> He reproaches them with what they had not done.<a name=231:11></a> They had not thrown down the altars of the Canaanites or the people of the land and He says, 'Now they will remain with you'.<a name=231:12></a> God will turn, you see, in His love, to good effect the fruits of our own negligence and carelessness; the things which we should have dealt with remain as thorns in our sides; but God remains.<a name=231:13></a> It does not say the angel left.<a name=231:14></a> They called it Bochim.<a name=231:15></a> It was the place of weeping.<a name=231:16></a> They had wept there.<a name=231:17></a> They spoke of what they had done but it was not Gilgal.<a name=231:18></a> I may weep and God accepts my tears, but they may not fully express what is required, but there it is, you see.<a name=231:19></a> The angel went from the one point to the other point and reminded the people of their negligence, what they had not done, and the consequence of it was that they are forced to dwell with the Canaanites who had become the occasion of discipline in the hand of divine love.<a name=231:20></a>

		an ancient foe, but retaining his power and his multitude for they overran the land.<a name=232:1></a> The people were nigh destruction for want of food, and so God sent a prophet, but a prophet is not an appearing.<a name=232:2></a> A prophetic ministry is invaluable; thank God for it.<a name=232:3></a> It is God convicting the conscience, but not an appearing.<a name=232:4></a> So you see in the chapter God sent a prophet to reproach the people again, but an angel of Jehovah sat under the terebinth; that is another matter.<a name=232:5></a> It is Jehovah Himself as the passage shows.<a name=232:6></a> "Jehovah", it says, "looked upon" Gideon -- the presence of personality.<a name=232:7></a> No one stood out in chapter 2 in the passage I read.<a name=232:8></a> All Israel were there -- no one stood out to lead in anything.<a name=232:9></a> We may thank God for the general effect.<a name=232:10></a> It is a very fine thing, the general effect of an appearing.<a name=232:11></a> All Israel were in view and all Israel were affected.<a name=232:12></a> They all wept.<a name=232:13></a> But now we come to personality.<a name=232:14></a> Weeping is not enough.<a name=232:15></a> Tears may quickly dry and never come again.<a name=232:16></a> Under certain influences we weep, but we want that steadiness which belongs to manhood and that is what Gideon presents to us.<a name=232:17></a> He presents manhood.<a name=232:18></a> At the present time what is needed among the people of God universally is just that; it is maturity.<a name=232:19></a> We have here, to illustrate what I say, a bullock, the second.<a name=232:20></a> The young bullock he is called and yet he is the second and he is seven years of age, which literally is not a young bullock.<a name=232:21></a> It is a remarkable combination, a young bullock, the second bullock, seven years.<a name=232:22></a> What is it, beloved, but a combination of maturity, of fully developed maturity, seven, and yet youthful freshness and added to that divine sovereignty.<a name=232:23></a> He is the second; he is divinely selected.<a name=232:24></a> Now you see what we are in the presence of in this appearing, and how essential these things are, the recognition of divine sovereignty in selection, leadership and what is required in leadership, full maturity, not simply one year as the passover lamb nor three years as in

	<div class="paragraph">
		not individuals, and that is what is in view here, that if we think of one another, what is that brother, what is that sister, it is a question of personality.<a name=234:1></a> If I bring into the assembly any personality I may have in this world I bring in extraneous material which is sure to work damage.<a name=234:2></a> The point is to acquire my personality inside, and so the Lord, after the great fact of material has been brought to light in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>, selected three men and took them up into the mount to see Him, not as they knew Him before but transfigured.<a name=234:3></a> He would show them His Person and His majesty in His own surroundings, as Peter says later, "we .<a name=234:4></a>.<a name=234:5></a>.<a name=234:6></a> were eyewitnesses of his majesty" <a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#1:16">2 Peter  1:16</a> that is personality.<a name=234:7></a> So that, dear brethren, when coming into fellowship, the thing is to leave all personality that I may have acquired in learning or by reading or money or natural ability -- to leave that outside because it is no use to God.<a name=234:8></a> I have got to leave it sooner or later.<a name=234:9></a> "No longer live, I", says one.<a name=234:10></a> "I am crucified with Christ".<a name=234:11></a> <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:20">Galatians  2:20</a> You see the personality of Paul in that sense had gone.<a name=234:12></a> So that the thing is as coming into fellowship, as we speak, to get an idea of Christ.<a name=234:13></a> He will show Himself to you.<a name=234:14></a> "I .<a name=234:15></a>.<a name=234:16></a>.<a name=234:17></a> will manifest myself to him".<a name=234:18></a> "He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him", <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:21">John  14:21</a> as if He would say, 'I want you to get personality, to see Me and to take on of My greatness', for that is the idea.<a name=234:19></a> "As is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly".<a name=234:20></a> <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:48">1 Corinthians  15:48</a> We come to that sooner or later.<a name=234:21></a> It is well worth while to begin to take on that personality, for without it I shall be poor in heaven.<a name=234:22></a> Well, that is what you get here.<a name=234:23></a> Jehovah looked upon him and He says, "Go in this thy might".<a name=234:24></a> Whether actually or potentially he was to be a mighty man, a man of war, one of the most striking in history.<a name=234:25></a> Well, that is the appearing here

		In what I have to say, dear brethren, tonight, I should like to emphasise the element of responsibility among the people of God.<a name=241:1></a> All are responsible, but from the outset of the people of God so viewed there was the feature of persons specially responsible called leaders or princes, eventually culminating specially in the king, and this feature necessarily continues; and although at times in the history of God's people the generality of the people was beyond the leaders in spiritual intelligence, generally it was not so.<a name=241:2></a> Generally those in the lead, and so specially responsible, <i>were</i> in the lead.<a name=241:3></a> Indeed the idea is that they should be.<a name=241:4></a> The idea of a leader is that he goes before which would mean in spiritual intelligence, courage, wisdom and love; so that we find the great leaders were said to have been sent before the people, that is Moses and Aaron and Miriam.<a name=241:5></a> The leaders are those responsible, those who indeed in Numbers are said to be summoned, persons summoned.<a name=241:6></a> The persons whose names are given were such as were summoned, we are told, as if they were there to be ready for a call from Moses.<a name=241:7></a> They were, as I said, in advance in spiritual stature so as to be regarded in a practical way as leaders, as princes, or as elders, or whatever the designation may be.<a name=241:8></a> And so, as I said, they were almost invariably, with a few exceptions, ahead of the people.<a name=241:9></a> This is seen especially in Judges where it is said that God raised up judges in His consideration for His people, and that He was with the judge.<a name=241:10></a> Whilst the judge lived God was with the judge and the people were helped and preserved; but, alas!<a name=241:11></a> when the judge died they did more corruptly even than their fathers.<a name=241:12></a> That is to say in the history of

		the people there was increased departure from God, for each generation did worse than their fathers.<a name=242:1></a> They did more corruptly; but then God was with the judge.<a name=242:2></a> We have there in the book of Judges, as we had last evening, the suggestion of the company being somewhat ahead of the responsible element.<a name=242:3></a> That is to say Manoah, the father of Samson, who is owned by the Spirit of God in his responsibility as head of the house, was not honoured by the divine appearing, by the angelic appearing.<a name=242:4></a> It was the wife.<a name=242:5></a> She discerned that the man who visited her, who was evidently in human form, was a man of God; and then she says that his appearance was like an angel of Jehovah.<a name=242:6></a> She had discernment; that is to say she had some ability to discern who the person was.<a name=242:7></a> Of Manoah it is said that he did not know that it was an angel of the Lord, so that he is behind his wife in spirituality and discernment; and then as God does wondrously and ascends he thinks he is going to die.<a name=242:8></a> He did not know God.<a name=242:9></a> At times, therefore, God exposes the responsible element by some test.<a name=242:10></a> Whilst recognising Manoah, He exposed him.<a name=242:11></a> The angel appeared on both occasions to the wife first.<a name=242:12></a> He was going to die, as he says in his thought, because he had seen the angel, 'But', says the wife, 'if God intended to slay us He would not have appeared to us thus, and said these things to us'.<a name=242:13></a> That is to say, she had the faculty of spiritual reasoning and deduction.<a name=242:14></a> That is a fine trait in God's people, able to think over things and make deductions.<a name=242:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But that is the exception, as I said; God intends to help His people through certain who are responsible, and so I wish to stress this, the responsibility attaching to such, the solemn responsibility.<a name=242:16></a> How many, the most honoured of God's servants, have failed in it for the simple reason that they considered on natural lines.<a name=242:17></a> I take as an illustration Abraham

		Then you find a man like Samuel, peerless in his day; in the house of Jesse, "Surely", he says in the presence of Eliab, "the Lord's anointed is before him".<a name=244:6></a> <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#16:6">1 Samuel  16:6</a> He missed it.<a name=244:7></a> He had the ability of recovery at once.<a name=244:8></a> He did not say that again, not to any of the seven sons of Jesse.<a name=244:9></a> But he missed it; he had to be corrected.<a name=244:10></a>

		And so, you see, I come down to my text, so that you may see similar features illustrated in this remarkable king, Jehoshaphat, one of the brightest on the line of David, one of the most memorable reigns -- he walked in the ways of Asa, we are told.<a name=244:11></a> He was commendable in that respect, although much might have been said as to other matters; but, you see, immediately this bright royal personage is spoken of as being thirty-five years of age when he began to reign, a matured man, and reigning twenty-five years, and is presented to us thus, then it is said the people had not yet sought the Lord, had not yet turned to the Lord.<a name=244:12></a> You see, what I have been saying is exemplified here.<a name=244:13></a> They had not yet, as if there was some possibility, some hope that they should.<a name=244:14></a> God had been with Jehoshaphat in a marvellous way giving him victory after victory and yet the people had not yet turned to the Lord, as you will observe, "the high places were not taken away; for as yet

		But to refer again to this young woman lying on a bed.<a name=266:11></a> She had an unclean demon.<a name=266:12></a> In these modern days we are living in an awful world, young people get defiled so easily; the world is calculated to catch the eye of the young, and the wicked one is set to get them occupied with its filth, its theatres, and its picture houses; the very worst the world can produce is presented to them for entertainment -- like the demons possessing the girl.<a name=266:13></a>

		Now here is a young girl with an unclean demon; that was her state.<a name=267:4></a> The Lord put Himself where the mother could reach Him, and so now mothers and fathers can reach Him for their children.<a name=267:5></a> In this case the mother besought Him.<a name=267:6></a> He was in a house in the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and she was a Syrophenician.<a name=267:7></a> You will observe the mother was very anxious about this matter.<a name=267:8></a>

		But then another great principle comes out in this incident, and that is, if we are to get blessing from the Lord, we must take our true place before Him.<a name=267:13></a> The Lord says to her, "it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it unto the dogs".<a name=267:14></a> In this gospel she is said to be a Greek, in Matthew she is only a Canaanite, but here she is more than a mere Canaanite, she is a Greek.<a name=267:15></a> That is to say, she had some little status in the world, for Greeks had then a great status in the world.<a name=267:16></a> Who is there here who does not think of some little status that he has got?<a name=267:17></a> It may be a little bit of money, or education, or some distinguished personal merit.<a name=267:18></a> You can never get blessing from the Lord on those lines.<a name=267:19></a>

		The message I have, dear brethren, has reference to judgment, not exactly punitive but discriminating judgment, the judgment that enables us to name what is in view whether it be good or bad.<a name=286:1></a> You will all recall the requirements in early Genesis as to names, for in the environment in which we are set everything in God's mind has a name, but in the case of living things Adam named them and apparently the names were in keeping with the mind of God for He altered none.<a name=286:2></a> If we misname things today spiritually God will not commit Himself to misname them.<a name=286:3></a> He will quickly indicate to us that the name is not just right; but in the naming of the creatures there was no change, as if God were to signalise the great intelligence vested in Adam.<a name=286:4></a> The host of heaven He had named Himself, not only names given in a promiscuous way but He calls the stars by name, He calls them.<a name=286:5></a> The calling is active, for nothing in God's realm is intended to be dormant or inactive.<a name=286:6></a> He calls the stars by name.<a name=286:7></a> The whole realm, beloved friends, of physical creation is named and so is the whole realm of the spiritual; every person and thing will have a name, and as God signalises Adam in allowing him to name the creatures, the living creatures, the land creatures, He intends to accord to us the honour of naming what comes within our range.<a name=286:8></a> It is so with God Himself, for the names accorded to divine Persons, to God, in the Old Testament indicate man's apprehension of Him.<a name=286:9></a> I can only name a thing according to that, whether it be the Supreme or the Almighty or the I AM.<a name=286:10></a> These names indicate man's apprehension of God.<a name=286:11></a> And so with our Lord Jesus, whilst His birth was announced -- "that holy thing

		Well now, I want to apply all this to good and evil in their most highly organised forms, not in detail.<a name=288:3></a> The verses I read in chapters 17 and 21 treat first of organised evil and second of organised good, and I would desire, dear brethren, that we should note the word 'organised' because organisation has a great place in Scripture.<a name=288:4></a> It has a great place in the development of this world and the most potent opposition to God and His interests is in organisation, and the most highly organised, and the most skilfully organised system of evil is depicted in these chapters 17 and 18.<a name=288:5></a> Its roots extend back; it is spoken of so early as Paul's ministry, the mystery of iniquity, its roots extending away back, you see, developing really out of that great imperial system at the hands of which our Lord Jesus was crucified, as we get so graphically presented in this book referring to the great city, this spiritual Sodom and Egypt where also our Lord was crucified; but that has a present virulent, almost universal existence in christendom and is one of the most solemn things to be considered.<a name=288:6></a> Heaven looks on all the time.<a name=288:7></a> Not that I wish to occupy you, especially the young ones here, with the evil; that is not the intent.<a name=288:8></a> I wish to occupy you with the one who shows you the thing here, this angel and whence he comes.<a name=288:9></a> You see he intends that we should have a judgment about things and that is why I read chapter 18:20, because at the destruction of this system heaven is called upon to rejoice, the saints are called upon to rejoice, the apostles are called upon to rejoice, the prophets are called upon to rejoice -- rejoice at what?<a name=288:10></a> That God has judged their judgment upon her.<a name=288:11></a> That appeals to me very powerfully.<a name=288:12></a> It lays it upon me that I should have an accurate judgment as before God, so accurate that God can commit

		Jude regards the saints in a peculiarly affectionate way.<a name=322:2></a> Indeed in that respect his epistle is a model for ministry, for he addresses the saints as "called ones beloved in God the Father and preserved in Jesus Christ".<a name=322:3></a> He had in mind to write to them of "the common salvation", but owing to the exigencies of the time he was obliged to write about conflict.<a name=322:4></a> It is well for a servant to be free before the Lord that he can turn from one thing to another under His direction, and according to the need amongst the saints.<a name=322:5></a> But whilst Jude writes of conflict and covers the ground of the activities of evil from the outset, dealing in the main with evil and how it is to be met, he does not fail to bring in what edifies.<a name=322:6></a> Our conflict is thus seen in a wholly affectionate setting, not provocative, but as the necessity of love, and he speaks of the saints in this endearing way as "beloved in God the Father".<a name=322:7></a> Then he speaks of the opposers under various heads in the most denunciatory manner ending with a specious form of opposition coming to light in these last days in persons "who set themselves apart, natural men, not having the Spirit".<a name=322:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have no doubt that the allusion is to the great sacerdotal system, in which the principle of separation is pushed forward as assuring a certain prestige among men for holiness, as it may be seen in the flesh in those who are called "natural men, not having the Spirit".<a name=322:9></a> We are therefore to be warned against any attempt at separation on official lines, for anything

		This is how the matter stands in Jude's mind, and he writes to the saints as "called ones beloved in God the Father and preserved in Jesus Christ".<a name=324:8></a> He is dealing with us from an elevated standpoint, and he reminds us in his epistle of the kind of conflict that the archangel Michael carried on.<a name=324:9></a> Michael disputed with the devil about the body of Moses -- a remarkable issue!<a name=324:10></a> It might be said, Why make that an issue?<a name=324:11></a> But if Satan makes anything an issue it must be contended against.<a name=324:12></a> If he wanted the body of Moses, he wanted it for some pernicious purpose.<a name=324:13></a> We are therefore guided negatively, as I may say, by what Satan does.<a name=324:14></a> We have to watch what he is doing, and you may depend upon it that whatever he does is against Christ in some way or other, and he is not to be allowed one inch.<a name=324:15></a> We are told that Michael contended with the devil for the body of Moses, but he contended in a comely way.<a name=324:16></a> It might not be expected that comeliness would enter into warfare with the devil, but no circumstances should draw us away from what is proper, from proper feelings and sentiments.<a name=324:17></a> The worst kind of adversaries are to be regarded in a comely way, and certainly so if it be a question of those known to be our brethren.<a name=324:18></a> If issues are raised, it behoves us in conflict to behave in a comely way.<a name=324:19></a> Here Michael does not bring a railing accusation against the devil, but says, "The Lord

		As I have already said, Jude brings in the saints as conveying the motherly element, and he says, "But ye, beloved, .<a name=325:4></a>.<a name=325:5></a>.<a name=325:6></a> praying in the Holy Spirit, keep yourselves in the love of God".<a name=325:7></a> What a word that is, dear brethren!<a name=325:8></a> How we are clothed with affection!<a name=325:9></a> Having a clear view as to the end, a hope in our souls, we may be assured that the Holy Spirit will develop in us all those instincts and feelings that are proper to the mother, so that some we save with fear.<a name=325:10></a> There is tenderness to the persons, pulling them out of the fire, but in this the militant spirit is seen, in that even the garment is hated.<a name=325:11></a> We must not be afraid of the word 'hate' -- "hating even the garment spotted by the flesh".<a name=325:12></a> How easily a garment may slip in which is seemingly acceptable, and the spot be unnoticed!<a name=325:13></a> These "filthy dreamers" in Jude's mind are "spots in your feasts".<a name=325:14></a> They are unnoticed, sunken rocks, it may be, but therein is their deadly danger.<a name=325:15></a> One might say much about garments amongst the people of God.<a name=325:16></a> Garments have a great place in Scripture, even a skin.<a name=325:17></a> God began making garments by using skins, and Leviticus contemplates the possibility of garments being spotted by leprosy.<a name=325:18></a> Even the profession of Christ might have the spot in it, so that there must be the "hating even the garment spotted by the flesh".<a name=325:19></a>

		Now that is Deborah.<a name=328:9></a> It says, "she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel".<a name=328:10></a> I speak of this because it applies to each of us, for the evidence of christianity in any one of us is necessarily null and void apart from personal victory over oneself.<a name=328:11></a> Unless I acquire that, I am of no use in the army of God.<a name=328:12></a> This great moral victory over herself obviously gave Deborah prestige in the eyes of the brethren.<a name=328:13></a> Apparently she never proffered her judgment, but they came to her for it.<a name=328:14></a> It is a sure sign of spiritual progress and of overcoming when the brethren ask counsel of another.<a name=328:15></a> Why should I not be able to give advice?<a name=328:16></a> Even in Corinth, shallow as the christianity of the Corinthians was, the least in the assembly was to be set to judge in certain matters.<a name=328:17></a> Every one of us ought to be able to give some advice, and certainly, as Nehemiah says, to take counsel with oneself; but of course I take the Lord into that

		So it says, they "came up to her for judgment".<a name=329:4></a> You can see how the people would come up to that woman as she dwelt under her own palm tree.<a name=329:5></a> She would not be filled with pride because the brethren came to her and asked her questions.<a name=329:6></a> She is said to be a prophetess, a remarkable expression in Scripture, conveying the mind of the Lord.<a name=329:7></a> Is not that a word for the sisters?<a name=329:8></a> It says also that she was the wife of Lapidoth, and Lapidoth refers to light.<a name=329:9></a> She is his wife, and a true one.<a name=329:10></a> One great feature of a wife is subjection, as the assembly is subject to Christ.<a name=329:11></a> United in the conflict.<a name=329:12></a> "Hath not the Lord God of Israel commanded?<a name=329:13></a>" It is urgent.<a name=329:14></a> If the Lord has commanded I have no choice.<a name=329:15></a>

		The next thing is to bring in the responsible element, which makes room for the leaders.<a name=329:16></a> Deborah was a mother in Israel, and the mother will not ignore the responsible element, or the feminine element.<a name=329:17></a> Hence Barak, not Deborah, is commanded; but she says, "Hath not the Lord God of Israel commanded?<a name=329:18></a>" and it was for him to "Go and draw towards mount Tabor".<a name=329:19></a> The battle was the Lord's and He was selecting the battleground.<a name=329:20></a> Many a time the truth suffers because we attack too soon or too late, or the ground is ill chosen.<a name=329:21></a> In the days of Absalom the battle was in the wood of Ephraim -- a poor battleground, for the wood destroyed more than the sword.<a name=329:22></a> That should not be.<a name=329:23></a> The weapon of destruction should be the sword, the "word of God".<a name=329:24></a> So that the battleground is selected by God and the victory is assured.<a name=329:25></a> I do not go into all the details, because they are well known; but I would just

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I conclude by calling attention to Jael, the wife of Heber, so that we might see how this same principle runs through this particular conflict.<a name=330:3></a> If we are successful in conflict, it will come to the doors of others of our brethren; faithfulness in conflict encourages others to come into it.<a name=330:4></a> Jael had no common interest with Deborah, her house was at peace with Jabin, and her tent was apparently open.<a name=330:5></a> But the very fact of her being at peace was used against the enemy, showing how that when we are right with God in the conflict, when our motives are pure and the faith alone is at issue, God brings everything into action for success.<a name=330:6></a> Here is a woman who obviously had no personal motive, and yet she is brought into the conflict in the most effective manner, and what she deals with is the head.<a name=330:7></a> She sees that in that head, as it were, the power lay.<a name=330:8></a> Just as headship according to God is Christ so we see that headship on the enemy's side is in someone else.<a name=330:9></a> That is the idea from the very outset, that the opposition was to be overcome by the enemy's head being bruised.<a name=330:10></a> The serpent's head was to be bruised, and it has been bruised.<a name=330:11></a> So here the head of Sisera was pierced with a tent-pin by the hammer in a woman's hand -- a remarkable triumph.<a name=330:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am speaking of this because it is important to see that as we are faithful in contending for the faith once delivered to the saints, the thing spreads and others come into it effectively.<a name=330:13></a> Jael takes what is available and she smites Sisera, so bringing to

		I was thinking, dear brethren, of spiritual greatness; greatness that develops on moral lines, which is seen, as I hope to show in these scriptures, in a man of like passions as ourselves.<a name=332:1></a> Of course, greatness in man (I am not now speaking of it as in God, although I hope to refer to that) must be seen in its perfection in Christ.<a name=332:2></a> It is as man He is our Leader and Model.<a name=332:3></a> So in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:32">Luke  1:32</a> Gabriel says, "<i>He</i> shall be great".<a name=332:4></a> The "He" is emphatic; the idea of greatness in man was coming.<a name=332:5></a> Many aspired to it; indeed, every man naturally does aspire to it.<a name=332:6></a> So we have Alexander the Great, Napoleon the Great, etc.<a name=332:7></a> We find a man called Simon the Great, who found an entrée among the professed converts of Philip (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#8">Acts  8</a>); a warning to all who serve in the field of the gospel.<a name=332:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are reminded of the possibility of a man coming in and being numbered with the converts, and yet he was Simon the Great all the time.<a name=332:9></a> He was a man that advertised.<a name=332:10></a> Advertising is a common thing with us.<a name=332:11></a> We slip it in sometimes when we are speaking of our humility.<a name=332:12></a> Simon advertised <i>himself</i>, that he was a great one, and his greatness was recognised.<a name=332:13></a>

		But, as I said, true greatness can be seen in its perfection in Christ only.<a name=333:3></a> So that Gabriel says to Mary, "<i>He</i> shall be great".<a name=333:4></a> Before He is born this is announced.<a name=333:5></a> In Himself He is great, but there is also what is conferred and acquired.<a name=333:6></a> First, God should give unto Him the throne of His father David.<a name=333:7></a> Caesar's and Napoleon's do not stand.<a name=333:8></a> We read in the book of Revelation that a throne <i>stood</i> in the heavens.<a name=333:9></a> This throne stands.<a name=333:10></a> It may appear to have gone under; no, beloved brethren, the throne of David exists in the King, the Son of David, and will soon appear as occupied by Him.<a name=333:11></a> That greatness would be awaited by faith.<a name=333:12></a> It is what He <i>would be</i> when Gabriel spoke; but when the angel spoke to the shepherds (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2">Luke  2</a>) it is what He <i>is</i>: "To-day a Saviour has been born to you in David's city, who is Christ the Lord" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:11">Luke  2:11</a>.<a name=333:13></a> It is a present thing now.<a name=333:14></a> As the prophet says, "For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name is called Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God, Father of Eternity, Prince of Peace" <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#9:6">Isaiah  9:6</a>.<a name=333:15></a> Set that down alongside all human greatness from Nimrod down!<a name=333:16></a> All fades away, but greatness in Christ will never fade.<a name=333:17></a> "Father of Eternity", think of that expression; and it is predicated of a Man, of One born, as it says, "<i>unto us</i>".<a name=333:18></a> You can thus see how enriched the people of God are.<a name=333:19></a> He is the "Mighty God, Father of Eternity, Prince of peace".<a name=333:20></a> So that there is the embodiment in Jesus of all human greatness -- all divine greatness, too; I am not speaking of that just now.<a name=333:21></a> You get the light as to greatness focussed on Christ so that the people of God should turn away their eyes from men.<a name=333:22></a> It is remarkable that even among the people of God there should be heroes here and heroes there.<a name=333:23></a> It is humbling to note

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having that clearly in our minds, I will seek to outline the idea in a man like ourselves, because, after all, greatness is intended to attach to the people of God.<a name=334:3></a> And I selected Moses because I believe the Holy Spirit has selected him to this very purpose, among many other things.<a name=334:4></a> There are several in Scripture of whom we have life-size pictures, particularly Jacob, Joseph, Moses, David, Peter, and Paul.<a name=334:5></a> They are given to us in this way, God intending to set out particular features in each.<a name=334:6></a> I am concerned tonight with the thought of greatness.<a name=334:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So I began with <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11">Hebrews  11</a>, because it ascribes greatness to Moses at the age of forty (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:24">Hebrews  11:24</a>), and what marked him then.<a name=334:8></a> He became greater still, beloved, as the records show.<a name=334:9></a> Stephen tells us "a period of forty years was fulfilled to him" <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7:23">Acts  7:23</a>, as if God gave him those years.<a name=334:10></a> God never lost sight of that young man, He had already secured him, anchoring him safe in giving him such parents as he had.<a name=334:11></a> He was fair to Himself, "exceedingly lovely", says Stephen.<a name=334:12></a> Stephen gives us the fulness of things.<a name=334:13></a> He was "full of the Spirit", and divine things glow in the hands of a man who is spiritual.<a name=334:14></a> He says there was given to Moses forty years and these were fulfilled.<a name=334:15></a> These were eventful years; three months of them in his father's house hidden, then a while in the ark, as Stephen puts it, "cast out".<a name=334:16></a> Under God this was the salvation of the babe.<a name=334:17></a> As in the ark he is <i>weeping</i>.<a name=334:18></a> There never was a great man according to God who did not weep.<a name=334:19></a> It is recorded of Moses at the outset, evidently as significant, that he wept.<a name=334:20></a> He was found there by his saviour, for the daughter of Pharaoh was no less a person for <i>the moment</i>, under

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is most interesting to see a man in the divine making, and that is why the lives of the men I mentioned are given in full.<a name=335:4></a> Moses <i>grew</i> in his mother's house; <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#2:10">Exodus  2:10</a>.<a name=335:5></a> There was no better soil for the growth of a future great personage in the service of God at that time than in the house of Moses' parents.<a name=335:6></a> Samuel grew in still better soil -- the house of God.<a name=335:7></a> Samuel grew in the house of God, a great man, too; Moses grew in the house of his parents, and the Holy Spirit dwells on those parents in the Old and New Testaments.<a name=335:8></a> Then he was in the house of Pharaoh's daughter, and there he grew, but the first growth is the telling one.<a name=335:9></a> The first growth is the one that counts with God, so that it is when he became great; not simply when he grew to be forty, but in growing to be forty he grew to be great.<a name=335:10></a> How is that proved?<a name=335:11></a> He refused to be <i>called</i> the son of Pharaoh's daughter.<a name=335:12></a> Think of what that means, not simply to be in the relationship, but to be <i>called</i> the son of Pharaoh's daughter!<a name=335:13></a> That implied his <i>known</i> or <i>public</i> status.<a name=335:14></a> Society in Egypt in those days would not think much of such a movement of that notable young man of the court of Pharaoh.<a name=335:15></a> 'Court items' would not flatter him for that.<a name=335:16></a> But what about the notes in heaven?<a name=335:17></a> After all, it is the records in heaven that count, and Moses began definitely to make history in heaven as he came to that decision.<a name=335:18></a> You may be assured, dear young people here tonight, that heaven takes notice of you when you come to a decision like that.<a name=335:19></a> You are now assuredly great in heaven's reckoning.<a name=335:20></a> Hundreds of years after Moses' action the Holy Spirit comments on it.<a name=335:21></a> Accurate records are there, beloved, of the great ones of God.<a name=335:22></a> Moses had become great, and he became greater still as he

		He is to graduate further, and I want to come to the passage in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#11">Exodus  11</a>because it shows how this initial greatness develops.<a name=336:13></a> One has to go on, it is either going forward or going backward, and Moses went forward.<a name=336:14></a> His life is divided into three parts by the Spirit of God, and he shines in every part; he shines brightly in the last third of his life, yes, the last year, as I hope to show.<a name=336:15></a> But in Egypt, where he esteemed the reproach of Christ, his greatness was to shine.<a name=336:16></a> So that the "man Moses" (the Holy Spirit loves to dwell on the <i>man</i>) "was very great".<a name=336:17></a> You say, Among the Hebrews?<a name=336:18></a> No, it does not say that here.<a name=336:19></a> He acquired greatness among the Hebrews, but he acquired greatness among the Egyptians.<a name=336:20></a> In the place of his degradation he became "very great".<a name=336:21></a> Does that not speak a word to all of us in the service of God?<a name=336:22></a> We speak of the man who can preach well,

		I have in mind, dear brethren, to speak about capacity; and I began with Genesis because it is a question of as <i>much</i> as we can carry.<a name=345:1></a> The setting is in the ministry of Joseph, one who represents the Lord Jesus in His present administrative office.<a name=345:2></a> The great feature of Joseph's ministry was food; not as growing promiscuously out of the earth according to the fruitfulness that the Creator had endowed it with: that is <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>, there is no idea of control in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>; it is simply the fruitfulness of the earth as providing for man and beast.<a name=345:3></a> But under Joseph we have control of food, and the section of Scripture which treats of the subject unmistakably points to Christ's present office in heaven, as in control of divine resources, particularly in its gentile, or worldwide bearing.<a name=345:4></a> Israel had to come to Him in that position: as it is now, Israel, or the remnant, has to come to Christ, not as at Jerusalem, but among the gentiles.<a name=345:5></a> His position is changed from what it was.<a name=345:6></a> He is, as Colossians puts it, Christ among you the hope of glory (see <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:27">Colossians  1:27</a>) -- a very touching matter, especially in view of what passed before us this afternoon, that each of us is among the brethren "every one among you".<a name=345:7></a> The Lord of glory is pleased to be among us, so that the position is great enough for the greatest, and not too great for the least believer; as it says, "The rich and poor meet together: the Lord is the maker of them all" <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#22:2">Proverbs  22:2</a>.<a name=345:8></a> Christ is among us, so that the fellowship is "the fellowship <i>of</i> God's Son", and that is great enough for the greatest, great enough for Michael the archangel, for Christ has passed above all heavens in His greatness.<a name=345:9></a> That is, He has passed far beyond the created sphere,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=346>[Page 346]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and that denotes His deity.<a name=346:1></a> No creature can go beyond the created sphere; a divine Person can, and yet He comes in here, and, according to Colossians, is said to be among the gentiles, "Christ among you"; well may it be added, "the hope of glory" <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:27">Colossians  1:27</a>.<a name=346:2></a> If He is among us, we may well hope that God will do for us as He is, "the <i>hope</i> of glory".<a name=346:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, there is a bountiful supply, but it is dealt out in wisdom; not in carelessness, but with wisdom.<a name=346:4></a> Anyone who reads the section will understand that whilst the earth brought forth by handfuls during the seven years of plenty, every care was bestowed that nothing should be lost, that all should be garnered, and so available for the years of famine.<a name=346:5></a> The time would come when the need would be for every bit of corn.<a name=346:6></a> But the principle comes out in this verse that certain persons who came for corn, were to have as much as they could carry.<a name=346:7></a>

		Hence, it becomes a question, dear brethren, as having to do with <i>our</i> Joseph (for that is why it is recorded; not as a matter of mere history), it is a question of how much I can carry.<a name=346:8></a> There is plenty; hence it is a question of capacity: that is to say, of the size of the sack that each of the sons of Jacob had.<a name=346:9></a> It was useless to come down for corn without a means of carrying it back.<a name=346:10></a> And so, in encountering christians, one thinks of how much they are carrying.<a name=346:11></a> A brother said to me the other day, after a Bible reading, 'Things are carried too far sometimes' -- and, of course, there is such a thing as that, of carrying things too far -- he meant that people are extreme in their way of presenting the truth; but he was not one that ever carried anything, as far as I know, in the way of divine things; he was not in fellowship, or is not.<a name=346:12></a> So that my reply was, 'Better to carry them too far, than not at all!<a name=346:13></a>' Some people do not carry anything at all; that is to say, they are irresponsible, and have no sacks, so to speak.<a name=346:14></a> They

		It is a question, therefore, beloved brethren, in our prayers, when we go to the Lord, in our prayer meetings, too, whether they are just ordinary religious affairs, or whether, when I bow my knees to the Lord at my bedside, it is just an ordinary religious duty to relieve my conscience, or whether I have a sack for my corn; asking the Lord for food.<a name=348:12></a> Whether in the morning I can open my Bible with my family, and have a bit of corn to deal out to the household; for that is the point.<a name=348:13></a> It was a question of the household with Jacob.<a name=348:14></a> And if my household is to live spiritually, I must get corn from the Lord, and have a sack to put it into.<a name=348:15></a>

		I had in mind, dear brethren, to speak about burden bearing, which brings before us the great subject of levitical service, and the first text being from Galatians reminds us of the great levite, that is, Paul, who is singled out as the one specially to be heard.<a name=357:1></a> You will all remember how that in approaching the great work in Philippi the Spirit of God tells us that the Lord opened Lydia's heart to attend to the things spoken by Paul.<a name=357:2></a> Much is said of his speaking in Acts, but at Philippi it was the things he said, and not only that he should be listened to, but that the things he said should be attended to.<a name=357:3></a> I may add that the great departure from the truth of christianity lies in the want of it, Eutychus of Troas representing what happens where there is inattention to what Paul says.<a name=357:4></a> He fell.<a name=357:5></a> You will all remember the occasion, and it is important that young persons here should take note of it.<a name=357:6></a> They came together on the first day of the week to break bread, and Paul discoursed until midnight.<a name=357:7></a> It was a test.<a name=357:8></a> We may look out for tests.<a name=357:9></a> Many move on and seem to be with the brethren in the truth until the test arises.<a name=357:10></a> The Lord has given us a test recently.<a name=357:11></a> It is on now -- a new feature relative to His Person.<a name=357:12></a> It is becoming a test, and it is now a question of how we shall meet this test.<a name=357:13></a> Eutychus, as you will remember, was amongst those present.<a name=357:14></a> No doubt there was a large number of brethren of different ages and sexes and inclusive of a good number of well-known levites, well-known ministers of the truth besides Paul.<a name=357:15></a> It was a great occasion spiritually; there were many lights, we are told, in the upper chamber, but in spite of all the lights Eutychus slept and fell.<a name=357:16></a>

		In Corinthians the apostle alludes to a letter of commendation, he did not need to carry a letter of commendation, some of them thought he did.<a name=371:13></a> That is to say the idea is reducing, the enemy was at work in causing the reducing, in discounting the things spoken by Paul.<a name=371:14></a> Paul's heart had been greatly affected by the covenant; a heart that Christ could write upon, yes, a heart that He could write the Corinthians in.<a name=371:15></a> Written in our hearts, the change is sure to show itself, dear brethren, how could it be otherwise?<a name=371:16></a> Christ has a place in my heart, but the evidence of it is the place the saints have in my heart.<a name=371:17></a> If there be any good, anything of good report, however little, speak of these things.<a name=371:18></a> That is the point he mentions, not simply that he did have them in his heart, but he had them in his heart in such a way that other people knew he had them in his heart.<a name=371:19></a> Do other people know that I love this one and the other one?<a name=371:20></a> Do they know that I love them?<a name=371:21></a> The Lord knows, and I may know, but that is not the point.<a name=371:22></a> It is the expression of it.<a name=371:23></a>

		When the New Testament cites types of the Old Testament we get the spiritual significance indicated, and so in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10">1 Corinthians  10</a>we have allusions to these passages, that is, the passage in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#17">Exodus  17</a>and <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#20">Numbers  20</a>.<a name=376:1></a> The apostle Paul says that they all, that is, Israel, those who came out of Egypt, "drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ", so that the passage is made very plain and applicable to the present moment.<a name=376:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The passage indeed in Corinthians treats of all who came out of Egypt; they did not all go into Canaan, in other words, many profess to have left the world, profess to believe in the Lord Jesus and are baptised, who do not go to heaven, who are not saved.<a name=376:3></a> A very solemn consideration, and especially as this passage is cited to establish that, that they even drank of the Rock!<a name=376:4></a> You may say, Did they then, mere professing persons, get the Holy Spirit?<a name=376:5></a> Receiving the Holy Spirit in the sense that He is given to believers, those who are subject to Christ, as is stated in Ephesians, "in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession" <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:13">Ephesians  1:13</a>,14 -- that passage refers to genuine believers who will never be lost.<a name=376:6></a> They have the earnest of the inheritance, awaiting the redemption of the acquired possession, awaiting the coming of the Lord.<a name=376:7></a>

		So the first feature of the Rock is here in chapter 17 where it is <i>smitten</i>.<a name=378:7></a> Moses was to go and take his rod -- not the priestly rod yet, there was no such thing as the priestly rod yet, that is the rod alluded to in Numbers; but this is the rod of Moses, the rod of authority, the rod of God!<a name=378:8></a> If that rod were allowed to come upon us sinners, it would be eternal separation from God!<a name=378:9></a> It was used in Egypt, it became the symbol in Moses' hand of the authority of God, and if the authority of God be applied to unrepentant sinners it means eternal separation from God.<a name=378:10></a> That is the rod of God!<a name=378:11></a> It may be used now in discipline since it has been employed in the smiting of Christ; but primarily it is God against sin, and God against sin means God against the sinner, and there is only one result if God is against the sinner: the sinner has to go down, has to be banished from the presence of God, and lie under the wrath of God, for ever.<a name=378:12></a>

		I hope to show you the important distinction between this passage and that in Numbers, that it does not say they drank here; the smiting was in order that there should be water.<a name=379:20></a> It does not say the water flowed -- I do not doubt that the water did flow -- but the Holy Spirit in the Scriptures is extremely

		I want you to take in the idea of the smiting, for many of us are very shallow in professing to believe because we do not believe in the smiting, that is to say, in the unmitigated judgment of God poured out on a <i>feeling</i> Jesus!<a name=381:2></a> He was a real man, as real as any, sin apart.<a name=381:3></a> He felt physical suffering, but He felt moral suffering.<a name=381:4></a> He felt persecutions from men, but when it came to God -- God's judgment unmodified was poured out as He alone could pour it out, upon His beloved Son, when He hid His face from Him -- when He cried, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?<a name=381:5></a>" <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22:1">Psalm  22:1</a> I was speaking about that passage the other evening, and one was touched by it.<a name=381:6></a> Some of the standers-by did not hear rightly when the Lord, citing the current Hebrew, cried, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?<a name=381:7></a>" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#27:46">Matthew  27:46</a> They thought He called for Elias.<a name=381:8></a> Their hearing was imperfect, and more than imperfect -- they thought He called for Elias; He was not calling for Elias.<a name=381:9></a> Many hear the gospel in that way, and get nothing out of it.<a name=381:10></a> They jeered at Him and persecuted Him, even whilst He was bearing the wrath of God!<a name=381:11></a> But there was one man there who did not mishear the Lord's words, that was the centurion who stood by; the Lord cried twice with a loud voice, and the centurion said, "Truly this man was the Son of God" <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#15:39">Mark  15:39</a>.<a name=381:12></a> Is that the faith of your heart?<a name=381:13></a> He is the Son of God.<a name=381:14></a> His voice in death has power in death; no one could cry like that in dying save the Son of God, but He died under the judgment of God, He was forsaken, as it says, "Why hast thou forsaken me?<a name=381:15></a>" That is what is so needed in our souls initially, if we are to be feeling christians, if we are to be repenting sinners all our lives, for that is the idea.<a name=381:16></a> If we are to be judging ourselves, the flesh and sin in us, we have to discern that Jesus was

		But then there is the other side -- <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#20">Numbers  20</a>-- a very similar transaction, and yet very dissimilar in many respects.<a name=382:3></a> The first variation I would notice is that the rod is not the same one as was used at Rephidim; and the second is that there was to be no smiting at all; and the third is that the water actually flowed at the time, and was actually drunk at the time, not only by the people, but by the cattle.<a name=382:4></a> Then another variation, and a sorrowful one, in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#20">Numbers  20</a>, is that Moses called the people "rebels" that were to drink the water.<a name=382:5></a> He called them rebels, and moreover he said, "Shall <i>we</i> bring forth to you water" -- <i>we</i>, as if <i>he</i> could do it!<a name=382:6></a> Then another variation on the divine side is that there was a priest present on this occasion, Aaron was present.<a name=382:7></a> I want to go over these details so that you may see how that it is no longer a question of smiting.<a name=382:8></a> The gospel has two parts: it must announce the death of Jesus or there can be no gospel, there must be the death of Jesus under the judgment of God or no gospel, because sin must be dealt with -- it would be intolerable to have it in the world that God has in His mind.<a name=382:9></a> It will not be there.<a name=382:10></a> "The Lamb of God .<a name=382:11></a>.<a name=382:12></a>.<a name=382:13></a> takes away the sin of the world" <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:29">John  1:29</a> -- it cannot be there, it must be removed.<a name=382:14></a>

		But the other side is that there is a risen, glorified Christ; there is no smiting in that connection.<a name=382:15></a> He was "raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father" <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:4">Romans  6:4</a> -- how very different from smiting!<a name=382:16></a> The glory!<a name=382:17></a> Instead of the rod of God, the forsaking of God, the Father raises the Son by His glory.<a name=382:18></a> Language would fail to define what that means, what was involved in that holy transaction of the Father in taking the Son out of the grave; it was a question of

		Well now, that brings me to <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#20">Numbers  20</a>.<a name=383:8></a> The water flowed and the people drank and their cattle, that is, it is the present moment, and peculiarly so because Moses and Aaron here typify the official class in the ministry; thousands have been hindered because of them.<a name=383:9></a> I am not wishing to say one word against these great servants of God personally, but like many others they have to take their place as types, and as types here they represent the official class.<a name=383:10></a> If I take the official class in its outstanding feature, I would take Rome.<a name=383:11></a> I am not here to traduce the religions around, but simply to help souls; if there is anyone here under the influence of the official class, I want to help you -- <i>they</i> do not help you.<a name=383:12></a> If it were not for the abounding sovereignty of God at the present time, the water would be shut off from us all by the official class.<a name=383:13></a> But God overrules and

		Moses added to that and smote; he falsified the position, and I believe that is what the official class is very largely doing -- they are falsifying the position, and we have to be on our guard that we do not allow ourselves to be darkened or hindered by them, but come straight to Jesus Himself.<a name=385:4></a> Moses smote the rock, and in spite of that the water flowed, for God is not going to allow the dispensation to be abolished by this official class.<a name=385:5></a> It is <i>God's</i> dispensation.<a name=385:6></a> The apostle Paul in writing to Timothy in view of this very official class, that they should not be allowed amongst the people of God, says, "God's dispensation which is in faith" <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#1:4">1 Timothy  1:4</a>, that is the principle of it; and it is a dispensation, the word really implies that God is dispensing in relation to His house, so that the most favourable conditions exist for the sinner.<a name=385:7></a> God is not dealing out through a citadel or a prison, He is dealing out through a system of affection, and that encourages the sinner to come, to ask, to speak, and the needs of the soul are met.<a name=385:8></a> God says, I will not allow the official class to abolish My dispensation, it is too great a matter; it cost God too much to establish it to admit of an official class abolishing it.<a name=385:9></a> They well-nigh abolished it in the middle ages, but God has set that iron rule aside, and He is causing the waters to flow!<a name=385:10></a>
