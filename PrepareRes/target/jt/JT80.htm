		My purpose is to speak about the love of Christ.<a name=1:2></a> The subject is such as to draw out our feelings, for it is said, "The Father loves the Son", <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:35">John  3:35</a>.<a name=1:3></a> At the Jordan the Father took occasion to speak about Him: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#3:17">Matthew  3:17</a>.<a name=1:4></a> On the mount He added, "Hear him", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#17:5">Matthew  17:5</a>.<a name=1:5></a>

		First, I wish to speak of the Lord's love for Paul.<a name=1:6></a> Paul is distinguished in many ways, but particularly in this that he says of the Son of God, "Who has loved me and given himself for me", <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:20">Galatians  2:20</a>.<a name=1:7></a> I do not recall that anyone else has said just those words.<a name=1:8></a> John says, in speaking of himself, that he was the disciple whom Jesus loved, but Paul says, "Who has loved me and given himself for me".<a name=1:9></a> But I desire to make a few remarks as to the context in which this remark occurs.<a name=1:10></a> The first and second chapters of this epistle to the Galatians are particularly in mind.<a name=1:11></a> Now, in saying this about himself, Paul works up to it, as if the thought grew in his mind as he reviewed events.<a name=1:12></a> In this epistle, the apostle is seen in relation to certain persons and circumstances which gave rise to certain thoughts about persons, some of whom were conspicuous.<a name=1:13></a> But in speaking of their conspicuousness he also brings in what <i>he</i> was; what marked him in those circumstances, and he gives some of the facts of his conversion.<a name=1:14></a> Now, in having to do with persons who are conspicuous we may be challenged as to the state of our minds.<a name=1:15></a> Naturally, we would be disposed to be conspicuous if there was any good reason for it.<a name=1:16></a> He had to do with the greatest persons on earth and the greatest in the mind of heaven.<a name=1:17></a> He recounts what happened at a certain time in Jerusalem and mentions

		certain facts.<a name=2:1></a> Paul was there, and Barnabas, and Peter, and James, and John and others.<a name=2:2></a> Paul himself speaks of what his feelings were, but he is going to tell us, later, that Christ loved him.<a name=2:3></a> He is going to tell us that as he proceeds with this letter.<a name=2:4></a> He says, "The Son of God, who has loved me and given himself for me".<a name=2:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, as having it in mind to say that, he touches on the reasons for saying it.<a name=2:6></a> This is not just anybody saying this.<a name=2:7></a> It is Paul!<a name=2:8></a> And in working up to this statement he has in mind that, when he says it, it will be obvious that he was loved by the Son of God.<a name=2:9></a> So that the mind is taken to the scene at Jerusalem where the greatest personnel in the universe were.<a name=2:10></a> There were others, too, who came in surreptitiously to spy out the apostle's liberty.<a name=2:11></a> But these would be ministers of the devil.<a name=2:12></a> But there were Peter and James and John who were conspicuous as being pillars.<a name=2:13></a> When Paul was younger, fourteen or more years before the events we have been speaking about, he went to Arabia.<a name=2:14></a> He had been converted, and he says, "I went to Arabia", <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#1:17">Galatians  1:17</a>.<a name=2:15></a> Well, why did he go there?<a name=2:16></a> I am speaking now as to how persons who are loved of the Lord can give reasons for what they do.<a name=2:17></a> We may be ready to say that we are loved of the Lord, but I am just a little afraid of persons being too ready to say these things, especially if we are quoting Paul.<a name=2:18></a> I would challenge our hearts as to this.<a name=2:19></a> But why did he go to Arabia?<a name=2:20></a> Maybe he went there to deny the flesh.<a name=2:21></a> No doubt he did.<a name=2:22></a> But what bearing did that have on Christ's love for him?<a name=2:23></a> The opposite would be found in one that was not spiritual.<a name=2:24></a> Such a one may go to Jerusalem to see what was there.<a name=2:25></a> But Paul did not do that.<a name=2:26></a> He went to Arabia.<a name=2:27></a> The Lord watched him on that journey.<a name=2:28></a> It was a long way.<a name=2:29></a> The Lord watched his footsteps; doubtless he was a lone man.<a name=2:30></a> He had not gone to Damascus a lone man; he was a man of importance; he was a great representative of the priesthood

		in Jerusalem in opposition to Christ.<a name=3:1></a> And he had company.<a name=3:2></a> But then he "went to Arabia, and again returned to Damascus", <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#1:17">Galatians  1:17</a>.<a name=3:3></a> Then after three years he went up to Jerusalem.<a name=3:4></a> We may have thought that he was going up to see the prominent brethren, to see the large meetings in Jerusalem.<a name=3:5></a> The leading men were there.<a name=3:6></a> But he did not go for that.<a name=3:7></a> He did not see any of them except Peter and James.<a name=3:8></a> He says that he "saw none other of the apostles, but James the brother of the Lord", <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#1:19">Galatians  1:19</a>.<a name=3:9></a> He did not go there to become acquainted with the great brethren and with the big meetings.<a name=3:10></a> Yet, that is just what we may be inclined to do as we have opportunity, but I would challenge our hearts as to it.<a name=3:11></a> Paul did not go to Jerusalem to get to big tea meetings or social affairs.<a name=3:12></a> This may be current among the brethren.<a name=3:13></a> Afternoon and evening teas may become quite social with very little about Christ in them.<a name=3:14></a> But Paul went up to Jerusalem to see Peter.<a name=3:15></a> We may like to do that too, and to see all the other great personages there.<a name=3:16></a> But Paul went up to see Peter, and not only to see him, but to <i>make acquaintance</i> with him.<a name=3:17></a> The young brethren need to make the acquaintance of the elder brethren; not simply to be able to say, I have seen Peter -- and James -- and John, but to make acquaintance that will advance you <i>spiritually</i>.<a name=3:18></a> Well, that is what Paul did.<a name=3:19></a> He was at Jerusalem for fifteen days, which would mean, very likely, that he spent two Lord's days with Peter, or, possibly, three.<a name=3:20></a>

		Well now, in the second chapter, he says that there were those who were conspicuous.<a name=3:21></a> How we do love to be something!<a name=3:22></a> But the apostle says, "If I .<a name=3:23></a>.<a name=3:24></a>.<a name=3:25></a> have not love, I am nothing", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#13:2">1 Corinthians  13:2</a>.<a name=3:26></a> We need to take that home.<a name=3:27></a> If we have not love we are nothing!<a name=3:28></a> But there were those who were conspicuous, of whom Paul says, They communicated nothing to me.<a name=3:29></a> But nevertheless they were something.<a name=3:30></a> Peter and John had said earlier, "Look on us", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#3:4">Acts  3:4</a>.<a name=3:31></a> They had something.<a name=3:32></a> "What I have, this give I to thee".<a name=3:33></a> They had love.<a name=3:34></a> They told the

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, after these things, which I have mentioned briefly, Paul tells us that when Peter came to Antioch, he withstood him to the face, because he was to be condemned.<a name=4:5></a> Now that is a very important feature of a person whom Christ loves, and that is what I am leading up to: a person whom Christ loves -- as to how he is worth loving.<a name=4:6></a> What a change had taken place!<a name=4:7></a> Here is Peter, the elder brother whom Paul had gone up to Jerusalem to see, and with whom he had spent fifteen delightful days.<a name=4:8></a> How much Peter could say to Paul, and how much Paul would value what his elder brother said to him!<a name=4:9></a> But now there is a change.<a name=4:10></a> We are <i>all</i> liable to change, even the most spiritual of us.<a name=4:11></a> Peter had become affected by party feeling.<a name=4:12></a> And not one of us is exempt from that.<a name=4:13></a> When some came from James, Peter withdrew and would not eat with the gentiles.<a name=4:14></a> But what is this man, whom Christ loved, going to do about Peter?<a name=4:15></a> Paul says, "I withstood him to the face, because he was to be condemned", <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:11">Galatians  2:11</a>.<a name=4:16></a> What he did shows why Christ loved him.<a name=4:17></a> If I say that Christ loved me, I want to show that there is some reason beyond the fact that I am a believer.<a name=4:18></a> Paul is telling us what he had done, and one of the important events was, that when Peter acted on party lines, and was not faithful to the truth, Paul withstood him to the face, and spoke to him about it before all.<a name=4:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, that is the point I am making, dear brethren; that if we make much of the fact that the Lord loves us, and there is little reason to be seen, we are liable to be challenged and <i>should</i> be challenged.<a name=4:20></a> Before

		Paul says that the Son of God loved him, he tells us these things which show that he was worthy of being loved.<a name=5:1></a> I have often said that the Lord has the right to make selection.<a name=5:2></a> God has the right to set His love upon a person in a special way, but if He does, there is usually some good reason for it.<a name=5:3></a> See how He speaks about Moses.<a name=5:4></a> Persons traduced Moses; his own brother and sister, Aaron and Miriam, spoke evil of him, but God stood in the breach.<a name=5:5></a> He said, "Why then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?<a name=5:6></a>", <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#12:8">Numbers  12:8</a>.<a name=5:7></a> If God sets His heart on a man He will show that it is deserved.<a name=5:8></a> So it is here; Paul is about to say that the Son of God loved him and had given Himself for him.<a name=5:9></a> And is it not justified in every respect?<a name=5:10></a> What a place Paul will have in heaven!<a name=5:11></a> "Henceforth the crown of righteousness is laid up for me, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will render to me in that day; but not only to me, but also to all who love his appearing", <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#4:8">2 Timothy  4:8</a>.<a name=5:12></a> One of the best reasons for advancing that the Lord loves me is that I love His appearing.<a name=5:13></a> What a day it will be for all lovers of Christ!<a name=5:14></a> I should not like to be among the non-lovers of Christ when He appears.<a name=5:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, Paul says, "Who has loved me and given himself for me".<a name=5:16></a> He carried that in his heart.<a name=5:17></a> In all the circumstances at Jerusalem he had carried in his heart that Christ loved him.<a name=5:18></a> But then, what portion did Christ have in what happened at Jerusalem?<a name=5:19></a> I believe that every movement of that servant was pleasurable to Him.<a name=5:20></a> I am sure of that.<a name=5:21></a> It was a long experience, and great conflict for the truth entered into it, but during every moment of it the Lord's eye rested on His servant.<a name=5:22></a> We have to remember that this was an inspired letter; the Spirit of God was in the matter and caused Paul to write these words.<a name=5:23></a> And the Spirit of God would have pleasure in him; so that, after all these events and all his faithfulness, which is recorded, He causes him to write: "But in that I now live in flesh, I live by faith, the faith of the Son of God, who has loved me and given himself for me".<a name=5:24></a>

		That was Paul's life, and, I might say, Christ's life entered into it.<a name=6:1></a> That is exactly what is meant.<a name=6:2></a> That was his wilderness life; it was his life in flesh, not yet life in heaven.<a name=6:3></a> All these events that I have spoken about refer to wilderness circumstances, and in these circumstances Christ was his life.<a name=6:4></a> "When the Christ is manifested who is our life .<a name=6:5></a>.<a name=6:6></a>.<a name=6:7></a>" <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3:4">Colossians  3:4</a>.<a name=6:8></a> Christ was his life; Christ was everything to him.<a name=6:9></a> It mattered little what others thought of him.<a name=6:10></a> "Whatsoever they were", he says, "it makes no difference to me", <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:6">Galatians  2:6</a>.<a name=6:11></a> <i>He</i> was dead, in the sense of which I have been speaking.<a name=6:12></a> He was "crucified with Christ, and no longer live, <i>I</i>, but Christ lives in me".<a name=6:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, I trust that each of us will be affected by what has been said and will challenge ourselves if there is any good cause why Christ should love us.<a name=6:14></a> Do we provide any such cause as Paul gives?<a name=6:15></a> any history like his?<a name=6:16></a> What part has my history with Christ's life?<a name=6:17></a> The history of the assembly enters into Christ's life; He lives for her, but then she is His joy, the pearl of great price.<a name=6:18></a> Paul wrote the epistle to the Galatians with his own hand, but the Spirit of God guided his hand to put down indelibly that the Son of God loved Paul and gave Himself for Paul.<a name=6:19></a> It was not that He loved Paul just as he was writing.<a name=6:20></a> Paul was relating history -- that when Christ died He had Paul in His heart; He died for Paul.<a name=6:21></a> I do not know of anybody else whose hand was guided by the Spirit of God to say that Christ loved him when He died.<a name=6:22></a> What an honour!<a name=6:23></a> And surely we may aim to be somewhat like him and give a reason why Christ loves us.<a name=6:24></a> We may say that we are lovers of Christ, but then, He is a Lover of us.<a name=6:25></a> That is just the point I make, and He wants to <i>say</i> that He is a Lover of us.<a name=6:26></a> But when He comes to some of us, how much can He say as to the reason for His love for us?<a name=6:27></a> Of course, there is the general thought that He loved the assembly, and gave Himself

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, I just go on to <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:13">2 Corinthians  5:13</a> where the apostle says, "For whether we are beside ourselves, it is to God; or are sober, it is for you.<a name=7:7></a> For the love of the Christ constrains us, having judged this: that one died for all, then all have died; and he died for all, that they who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who died for them and has been raised".<a name=7:8></a> I am now going to speak about the influence of Christ's love and how it leads up to a right judgment because I find in myself, as I do in the brethren, that we are very poor in our judgment, both of persons and of things.<a name=7:9></a> This passage is to teach us something of judgment.<a name=7:10></a> He says, "For the love of the Christ constrains us, having judged this: that one died for all, then all have died".<a name=7:11></a> That is judgment, and it hangs, really, on the fact of Christ's love for him.<a name=7:12></a> He had acquired experience of the love of Christ and it influenced him in the way of judgment: "having judged this that one died for all, then all have died".<a name=7:13></a> And again, "He died for all, that they who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who died for them and has been raised".<a name=7:14></a> I wish to enlarge on the importance of forming a judgment of persons and things.<a name=7:15></a> The Corinthians were very poor in their judgment.<a name=7:16></a> Some of the leaders there spoke very disparagingly of Paul.<a name=7:17></a> They said that his speech was contemptible.<a name=7:18></a> They spoke ill of each other.<a name=7:19></a> There were partisans among them.<a name=7:20></a> They had their friends, and non-friends.<a name=7:21></a> It was a humbling situation but it is written down, beloved, that we should not be marked by these things.<a name=7:22></a>

		The apostle says, "For the love of the Christ constrains us, having judged this: that one died for all, then all have died".<a name=8:1></a> Now, that is how we judge.<a name=8:2></a> If it were possible for Paul to stand up with the hundreds of millions of men and women on the earth before him, he would take account of them as dead.<a name=8:3></a> They may be scholars, orators, great statesmen, great soldiers, and what not.<a name=8:4></a> They are all dead.<a name=8:5></a> I speak now of those that are not christians.<a name=8:6></a> Of believers, he says, "That they who live .<a name=8:7></a>.<a name=8:8></a>.<a name=8:9></a>" But what about those great men who have fought and judged nations, who are ruling countries?<a name=8:10></a> Is it right to say that they are living to Christ?<a name=8:11></a> "That they who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who died for them and has been raised".<a name=8:12></a> Is it right?<a name=8:13></a> Can they be said to be living to Christ?<a name=8:14></a> It is not so.<a name=8:15></a> I am leaving out true christians for the moment.<a name=8:16></a> But take the millions of people who are not believers -- Paul has judged "that one died for all, then all have died".<a name=8:17></a> It would take time to give some idea of the meaning of this.<a name=8:18></a> I only mention the scripture itself for us to look into it and face the fact as to what is on the earth and how God looks at it.<a name=8:19></a> Men are dying every day, but morally it is all done.<a name=8:20></a> One died for all, then all have died.<a name=8:21></a> But then we are to see what modifications there are.<a name=8:22></a> It says, "that they who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who died for them and has been raised".<a name=8:23></a> The others are all dead; but anybody that lives, is not to live to himself, not to be selfish, but to live to Him who died for us and rose again.<a name=8:24></a> The Lord Jesus has died for us and has risen again for us.<a name=8:25></a> He is glorious!<a name=8:26></a> He is triumphant!<a name=8:27></a> He is in heaven!<a name=8:28></a> He is received there!<a name=8:29></a> He is everything there!<a name=8:30></a> Well, what about my life from now on?<a name=8:31></a> What is it to be?<a name=8:32></a> Living to Christ?<a name=8:33></a> That is the only thing.<a name=8:34></a> Morally, we should not live at all if we are not living to Him who died for us and rose again.<a name=8:35></a> It is a matter of only a few years and our lives here will all be over.<a name=8:36></a> We may as well look it in the

		Now I want you just to carry that word 'build' in your minds into what I am about to say as to the verses I have read in Hebrews and in Revelation.<a name=16:2></a> The book of Revelation takes account of the assembly, in a peculiar way in the use of the word 'bride'.<a name=16:3></a> John, in speaking of the assembly, uses that word, and he uses it in the sense that she is "as a bride adorned for her husband", in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21:2">Revelation  21:2</a>, and, "I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife", in verse 9.<a name=16:4></a> <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21:9">Revelation  21:9</a>.<a name=16:5></a> She is thus shown to John.<a name=16:6></a> He says, first of all, "I saw a new heaven and a new earth .<a name=16:7></a>.<a name=16:8></a>.<a name=16:9></a> and I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21:1">Revelation  21:1</a>,2.<a name=16:10></a> That is, she has done something.<a name=16:11></a> Eve had been prepared for Adam.<a name=16:12></a> God had performed a remarkable piece of work without Adam's knowledge.<a name=16:13></a> He had taken out a rib and had closed up the flesh, as if He were to say, You are not to know what came out of there; it is going to be mystery.<a name=16:14></a> Presently it is to be disclosed.<a name=16:15></a> Something had happened, but God would say, You are to wait for the time of the revelation of the mystery.<a name=16:16></a> We are in the time of mystery; it marks our dispensation; and those of us who are in the dispensation, characteristically, are initiated into the mystery; the mystery of the kingdom of God, and the mysteries of God.<a name=16:17></a> This rib taken out of Adam, and the flesh closed up where it had been, is one of them.<a name=16:18></a> Much is said about Eve, but that mystery remains untold.<a name=16:19></a> Now it is disclosed, and the book of Revelation contemplates it.<a name=16:20></a> John the evangelist says, "And I saw a new heaven and a new earth .<a name=16:21></a>.<a name=16:22></a>.<a name=16:23></a> .<a name=16:24></a> And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21:1">Revelation  21:1</a>,2.<a name=16:25></a>

		Now I wish to show that the bride has the first place with God; I will say, with Deity, to make the thing plainer.<a name=17:6></a> The title "God" may be used in a final way, but when we speak of 'Deity' we use another word, we are speaking of what is to be reverenced, and to which we bow.<a name=17:7></a> We are to bow to God, but we are to worship when we use the word 'Deity'.<a name=17:8></a> It is a special thought which is particularly available to the minds of those of the assembly.<a name=17:9></a> The assembly is capable of taking in more of it than any other family.<a name=17:10></a> And so it is that the Lord says, "And the Spirit and the bride say, Come.<a name=17:11></a> And let him that hears say, Come.<a name=17:12></a> And let him that is athirst come; he that will, let him take the water of life freely", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:17">Revelation  22:17</a>.<a name=17:13></a> Now, this is after the Lord Jesus had said, "<i>I</i> Jesus have sent mine angel to testify these things to you in the assemblies", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:16">Revelation  22:16</a>.<a name=17:14></a> The Lord is speaking in a personal way to us; He is speaking in the assemblies; He is not speaking abroad to the world; He is speaking in the assemblies, in a personal way to us.<a name=17:15></a> He says, "<i>I</i> Jesus have sent mine angel to testify these things to you in the assemblies", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:16">Revelation  22:16</a>.<a name=17:16></a> And then He says something about Himself.<a name=17:17></a> He is saying it in the assemblies, not anywhere or to anybody, but to the assemblies.<a name=17:18></a> And He speaks about Himself: "<i>I</i> am the root and offspring of David, the bright and morning star", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:17">Revelation  22:17</a>.<a name=17:19></a>

		Well now, I come to the immediate thing I had in mind -- what the Spirit and the bride say.<a name=18:9></a> It is what is being said in response.<a name=18:10></a> It is a great way with God to say certain things and then look for response.<a name=18:11></a> There is very little response today, I am sure.<a name=18:12></a> At the same time, christianity is a current matter and some are speaking and responding to what God has said, and the response here is in two beings, speaking reverently.<a name=18:13></a> The first is the Holy Spirit, who is God Himself.<a name=18:14></a> When I speak thus, I am seeking to be reverential, to be very careful to say nothing that would discredit the Holy Persons of the Deity, but it is within our range to have to say to what God is saying, because the Holy Spirit is saying, "Come" to Jesus.<a name=18:15></a> The word 'come' perhaps was never employed in a more effective way than here.<a name=18:16></a> "The Spirit and the bride say, Come", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:179">Revelation  22:179</a>.<a name=18:17></a> It is spoken in a united way.<a name=18:18></a> The first speaker is God Himself and the second speaker, whose utterance is in perfect unison, is the bride of Christ.<a name=18:19></a>

		J.T.<a name=20:2></a> The leading feature of this epistle, following on the first epistle, is what is said about the man of sin.<a name=20:3></a> It is important that so much stress is laid on the need of paying attention to facts in looking into the matter.<a name=20:4></a> The apostle says, "Now we beg you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to him, that ye be not soon shaken in mind, nor troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter, as if it were by us, as that the day of the Lord is present".<a name=20:5></a> Clearly it is a matter of great importance, at first positively and then negatively.<a name=20:6></a> First, we are to have a clear understanding of this subject of the man of sin; but that understanding should be accompanied by what we have in the opening verse; "the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to him".<a name=20:7></a> The mind is thus directed solemnly and urgently to the consideration of this matter, but by these preceding thoughts, as if we are to be filled with them first, and so be ready for the awfulness of the subject; that is, the imminence of the appearing of the man of sin.<a name=20:8></a> We are to be fully ready for it and equipped so as not to be overcome but in a spiritual way be ready for it.<a name=20:9></a> The Lord had said in His addresses to the assemblies, that He would keep the assembly from the great tribulation which is involved in this matter.<a name=20:10></a> "<i>I</i> also will keep thee out of the hour of trial, which is about to come upon the whole habitable world, to try them that dwell upon the earth", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:10">Revelation  3:10</a>.<a name=20:11></a> So that we shall be out of it; we shall not go through the awfulness of what is indicated here, but it is all the more necessary that we should understand it and be warned; especially the thought of the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ and our

		from the great range of things which opens up, and I now mention the matter of priesthood and in doing so I am thinking of Exodus.<a name=59:1></a> Genesis speaks about priesthood too; indeed it speaks about one of the greatest priests; in fact, <i>the</i> greatest priest, because Melchisedec speaks of Christ.<a name=59:2></a> But it is priesthood in the wilderness that I am thinking about and Aaron represented that.<a name=59:3></a> Aaron was taught of God in priesthood.<a name=59:4></a> We cannot say that of Melchisedec, exactly, for he was a mysterious person, said to be assimilated to the Son of God.<a name=59:5></a> But Melchisedec did not teach Aaron to be a priest; Aaron was taught of God.<a name=59:6></a> Two of his four sons died under the government of God, and Aaron and his two sons continued in the priesthood.<a name=59:7></a> But I want to say (and this is important for both brothers and sisters) that we do not get anything about the priesthood of Aaron and his sons until we hear about the servant, spoken of in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#21">Exodus  21</a>.<a name=59:8></a> It is as if God were to tell us that He wants us to serve Him -- because that is the one great idea in priesthood, that we are to be in service.<a name=59:9></a> As was said of Aaron "that he may serve me", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#4:23">Exodus  4:23</a>.<a name=59:10></a> He is to be the servant, but his name is not mentioned as priest, nor are his sons' names mentioned either, until they learned how to love.<a name=59:11></a> That is my great burden tonight -- this matter of love.<a name=59:12></a> Aaron and his sons are not spoken of as priests until we read of the Hebrew servant in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#21">Exodus  21</a>, who says, "I love my master, my wife, and my children", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#21:5">Exodus  21:5</a>.<a name=59:13></a> It was not simply that he was a Hebrew slave, but he was a man who knew love.<a name=59:14></a> John says, "Hereby we have known love, because <i>he</i> has laid down his life for us", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:16">1 John  3:16</a>.<a name=59:15></a> That is how we know it.<a name=59:16></a> In the early days of the pagan Greeks, they did not know love; they did not know the meaning of the word.<a name=59:17></a> We must come to Scripture, and to persons mentioned in Scripture as priests, to know love.<a name=59:18></a> And these persons are specifically Aaron and his sons.<a name=59:19></a> And I mention them, dear brethren, so that we may have in mind that if we are

		Now I think the dear brethren will conclude that I am not going beyond anyone's reach in what I am saying.<a name=60:5></a> The divine school began with Adam, I believe.<a name=60:6></a> That is what is meant, I think, in Enoch being said to be the seventh from Adam.<a name=60:7></a> And if we are to be in that divine school, we have to begin with the great lesson of love and go on with it, keep on with it, prove it every minute, because it is to be known, it is to be proved.<a name=60:8></a> "Hereby we have known love", John says.<a name=60:9></a> The Spirit of God, through him, tells us that love is known "because <i>he</i> has laid down his life for us", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:16">1 John  3:16</a>.<a name=60:10></a> And so, if we are to learn this great lesson of love there must be some exemplification of the thing, and it must be constant.<a name=60:11></a> The exemplification is in the fact that "he laid down his life for us".<a name=60:12></a> And it now involves that, in some sense, <i>we</i> are laying down <i>our</i> lives.<a name=60:13></a> So that it is a time for everyone to enquire before the Lord about these matters, What have I learned today about laying down my life?<a name=60:14></a> That is how the thing came out in Jesus, "Hereby we have known love, because <i>he</i> has laid down his life for us", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:16">1 John  3:16</a>.<a name=60:15></a> So that the passage goes on to say, "And we ought for the brethren to lay down our lives".<a name=60:16></a> Thus the thing will soon become a daily matter, dear brethren, an acquired matter, a mastered matter, as it were, that I know love.<a name=60:17></a> And we should not give up our application to the thing until we master it, as they say in the schools.<a name=60:18></a> And so Aaron and his sons mastered it, in type, because when the Hebrew

		Well, I must conclude, because we are to be governed by measure in our speaking, but I feel that learning love is a great matter and it is included, though not mentioned, in the passage of <a href="../bible/John.htm#6">John  6</a>"They shall be all taught of God".<a name=61:3></a> That is a great general fact that the saints of God are, generally, in the divine school.<a name=61:4></a> But Paul, in his letter to Thessalonica, specifies that "ye .<a name=61:5></a>.<a name=61:6></a>.<a name=61:7></a> are taught of God to love one another".<a name=61:8></a> He did not need to tell them about it because they were taught of God.<a name=61:9></a> God Himself had taught them.<a name=61:10></a> That is the thing -- God Himself is teaching the matter of love.<a name=61:11></a> It was as though He did not leave the matter even with Paul or with Peter.<a name=61:12></a> Not that they did not teach it, because I am sure they did, but it is as if God were to say, I will undertake this matter Myself because it is so important.<a name=61:13></a> And hence, in that remarkable chapter (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#13">1 Corinthians  13</a>) the writer says, "If I .<a name=61:14></a>.<a name=61:15></a>.<a name=61:16></a> have not love, I am nothing", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#13:2">1 Corinthians  13:2</a>.<a name=61:17></a> What a sweeping thing that is.<a name=61:18></a> Do we have it?<a name=61:19></a> If we do not have it, the writer says, we are nothing!<a name=61:20></a> We may give all our goods, and even our bodies to be burned, but if we have not love, we are nothing.<a name=61:21></a> That is a sweeping matter.<a name=61:22></a>

		J.T.<a name=118:10></a> I think chapter 7 is the balance of the 4th, and contemplates progress in believers; the word is, "But this he said concerning the Spirit, which they that believed on him were about to receive".<a name=118:11></a> The believing is past history in the disciples, but culminates in this; they had already believed.<a name=118:12></a> Believing in John is progressive; the faith here is beyond the woman's faith in chapter 4.<a name=118:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=170:1></a> One has been thinking of the disposition the Lord would make of us all so that we may be mutually helpful, both brothers and sisters, in order that we may get the benefit of what there is available, and hence I thought of suggesting the idea of 'walking' in the Scriptures.<a name=170:2></a> It is said in Hosea that Jehovah taught Ephraim to walk and it is thought to link that on with the types, first seeing the bearing of the prophets on such a thought, and then the types in Exodus and Numbers.<a name=170:3></a> As I said, the passage in Hosea was suggested because it speaks of Jehovah teaching Ephraim to walk.<a name=170:4></a> That is how it should read in verse 3: "And I it was that taught Ephraim to walk, -- He took them upon his arms".<a name=170:5></a> The verses read suggest that this is a divine thought, that we should know how to walk.<a name=170:6></a> There are also other thoughts that enter into the passage which denote the divine and tender feelings shown to Israel as He took them up out of Egypt.<a name=170:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in Exodus, the passage, "And the children of Israel went arrayed out of the land of Egypt", really means, according to the note, that they went out by fives.<a name=170:8></a> That would be a military formation.<a name=170:9></a> Later it is hoped that we shall look at Numbers where walking is taken up more definitely in relation to the tabernacle, but so far the scriptures read are to show what they were as coming out of Egypt, formed militarily, not simply to make war but in view of the tabernacle, and how they were to walk in relation to it in certain groups -- four groups.<a name=170:10></a> It is thought that the allusion to Hosea would affect us as it is intended to, having been written by one who was a very sympathetic man, most tender in his feelings toward Israel, yet firm, saying the very strongest things which were needed.<a name=170:11></a> But what is especially in mind now, as we remarked, is as to our walking together, and whether we are to be divinely

	<div class="paragraph">
		L.E.<a name=171:3></a>S.<a name=171:4></a> It is very touching that following on in that chapter in Hosea it says, "My heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together.<a name=171:5></a> I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not again destroy Ephraim; for I am God, and not man, -- the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not come in anger.<a name=171:6></a> They shall walk after Jehovah" <a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#11:8">Hosea  11:8</a> - 10.<a name=171:7></a> Do you think there should be a correspondence in these days with that?<a name=171:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=171:9></a> That is just what is in mind.<a name=171:10></a> The first such walking is spoken of as alone: "Enoch walked with God" <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#5:24">Genesis  5:24</a> -- not after Him but with Him.<a name=171:11></a> It is an individual matter.<a name=171:12></a> So did Noah walk with God; and God said to Abraham, "Walk before my face, and be perfect", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#17:1">Genesis  17:1</a>.<a name=171:13></a> So that it was early in the mind of God, and the question now is as to walking together.<a name=171:14></a> It is applicable to a local position, as it is to the general one, for Ephesians speaks of walking.<a name=171:15></a> God had ordained certain works that we should walk in them (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:10">Ephesians  2:10</a>), which would be more general and universal, for there is a great deal of individual or independent action, I might say, in localities taking on certain ways and procedures.<a name=171:16></a> We should have in mind that assembly customs are to be universal.<a name=171:17></a> "But if any one think to be contentious, <i>we</i> have no such custom, nor the assemblies of God", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:16">1 Corinthians  11:16</a>.<a name=171:18></a> So that in these procedures whatever they may cover we ought to bear in mind that there is universality and catholicity in all that is done in the assembly.<a name=171:19></a> The allusion to going out arrayed, meaning they went out five in a rank, is certainly very suggestive, indicating that we are not making any great show of strength or numbers, but yet in rank and order -- military order.<a name=171:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=172:19></a> Well, no doubt what is really involved in her position is that she was moving in the principles already inaugurated.<a name=172:20></a> It comes after the mount of transfiguration in which the voice says, "<i>This</i> is my beloved Son: hear him", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#9:35">Luke  9:35</a>.<a name=172:21></a> She was moving on that line and was hearing Him.<a name=172:22></a> She had an ear, not on the mount but in her own house (or at least in her sister's house) and she was sitting at His feet hearing what He was saying.<a name=172:23></a> The point would be, therefore, to take in whatever the principal word is for the moment, and this particular thing is what she observed, for she sat at His feet and heard what He was saying.<a name=172:24></a>

		J.T.<a name=236:24></a> Yes; and in that connection we get something here as regards Moses' father-in-law.<a name=236:25></a> That is, Moses felt he needed a man to help him in the wilderness.<a name=236:26></a> It says in verse 29, "And Moses said to Hobab, the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses' father-in-law, We are journeying to the place of which Jehovah said, I will give it unto you: come with us, and we will do thee good; for Jehovah has spoken good concerning Israel.<a name=236:27></a> And he said to him, I will not go; but to mine own land, and to my kindred will I go.<a name=236:28></a> And he said, Leave me not, I pray thee, because thou knowest where we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou wilt be to us for eyes.<a name=236:29></a> And it shall be, if thou come with us, that whatever good Jehovah doeth unto us, so will we do to thee".<a name=236:30></a>

		Now I just refer to this paragraph because it brings in something that we are likely to make too much of, that is natural relationships in the things of God.<a name=237:1></a> Moses' father-in-law was useful, according to chapter 18 of Exodus; he served well in pointing out to Moses a state of things that would tend to wear him out, and Moses took his advice and God evidently blessed him.<a name=237:2></a> But now Moses is seeking his help again and this time he does not help, nor does he even indicate that he cares much for the saints.<a name=237:3></a> He says, "I will not go; but to mine own land, and to my kindred will I go".<a name=237:4></a> Now the only point I am making is that natural relationships are not to be trusted in the things of God.<a name=237:5></a> Moses is finding out here that although the relationship with his father-in-law was good, and profitable too, yet it did not last; it could not be trusted.<a name=237:6></a> We are not to trust our natural relationships, we cannot rely on them, and hence what follows is that in verse 33 it says, "And they set forward from the mountain of Jehovah and went three days' journey; and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah went before them in the three days' journey".<a name=237:7></a> Instead of Hobab we have the ark of the covenant.<a name=237:8></a> Our natural relatives are not trustworthy, but the Lord is trustworthy; the ark of the covenant is trustworthy.<a name=237:9></a> The thing for us is to come into the knowledge of divine Persons, just as we have been saying; the doctrine of the Deity, the Persons of the Godhead as John presents Them in his epistle.<a name=237:10></a>

		So as to Peter the Lord said, "When thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee", <a href="../bible/John.htm#21:18">John  21:18</a>.<a name=294:12></a> And I say to you young people, the older you become, the more serious you become -- I mean, normally -- and presently the time of departing to be with the Lord is coming, either by translation or death.<a name=294:13></a> It is imminent, and becomes more and more real, so that you are more disposed to be resigned to the will of God.<a name=294:14></a>

		Now Matthew has all this in mind.<a name=294:15></a> He is one of the precious stones and doubtless he is precious in the sense of gathering up the Lord's mind about the assembly.<a name=294:16></a> He is the only apostle, the only evangelistic

		writer, who speaks about the assembly formally, and I have no doubt that the Lord especially values Matthew because he did write about the assembly.<a name=295:1></a> Matthew came into the Lord's mind as one who would write about that which He loved most and best.<a name=295:2></a> The most beautiful thing in the whole realm of the universe, of the creation, is the assembly, outside of divine Persons of course.<a name=295:3></a> They are not things, They are Persons, but the assembly is a thing and it is the most beautiful.<a name=295:4></a> It is composed of persons of course, but it is nevertheless a thing though presented as a peculiarly substantial thing -- perfectly so, indeed, and measured.<a name=295:5></a> It is measured in the sense of being a cube, showing that it is substantial.<a name=295:6></a> It is not unreal; there is nothing imaginary about it; it is a substantial thing to be known as such.<a name=295:7></a> So the Lord undoubtedly regarded Matthew peculiarly because he was to write about the assembly; he writes about it in a certain chapter especially but all the gospel bears on that great subject.<a name=295:8></a> That is the theme, the trend of it -- it all bears on the assembly.<a name=295:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This leads me to another point that I have in mind, and that is that the masculine side is greatly stressed in Matthew.<a name=295:10></a> The stressing of it is seen in the history of our Lord as born into this world, and the facts as to His mother and His father, His father by reputation that is, Joseph.<a name=295:11></a> God is His Father, of course, but Joseph was His father because he was the husband of Mary; He is called the Lord's father in that sense, conveniently so; and he is made more of in Matthew than in Luke or in Mark, all by design, and all in accord with what is divinely done, the cause not far to seek.<a name=295:12></a> Hence we have in Matthew, "Book of the generation of Jesus Christ" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#1:1">Matthew  1:1</a>; not those that were born of Him, that were descendants of His, but it is put in this way -- that the generation is His.<a name=295:13></a> One person in it is Abraham,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		but it is not Abraham's generation.<a name=296:1></a> In Genesis there are ten generations given to us and we might have expected Abraham's to be given, but it is not; the greatest man in Genesis is Abraham, but his generation is not given.<a name=296:2></a> Adam's is given; Noah's is given, and those of others, but not Abraham's.<a name=296:3></a> Can we doubt that the Spirit with beautiful design and instinct omitted Abraham from the list of those whose generations were given, for the reason that he was to be directly in the line of the Messiah?<a name=296:4></a> He saw Him.<a name=296:5></a> Could Abraham wish to have his own generation portrayed in the presence of the fact that he saw the Messiah?<a name=296:6></a> And he rejoiced to see Him: "Abraham exulted in that he should see my day, and he saw and rejoiced", <a href="../bible/John.htm#8:56">John  8:56</a>.<a name=296:7></a> He would, as it were, hide in that holy presence of the Lord Jesus Christ, and as Matthew serves to give us the generation of that Person, Christ is first mentioned.<a name=296:8></a> It is, "the generation of Jesus Christ", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#1:1">Matthew  1:1</a> not Isaac, not Abraham, not Jacob, not David, but Jesus Christ.<a name=296:9></a> He must be the First in that sense.<a name=296:10></a> So we have no generation of Abraham given in Genesis; in truth he is the heavenly man, and that is what one had in mind.<a name=296:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So I have read this passage because it speaks of sons.<a name=296:12></a> It is an outstanding passage in Matthew in that it speaks of sons; not children.<a name=296:13></a> We had it today that John speaks much of children.<a name=296:14></a> Matthew speaks about the Lord Jesus as a little Child with His mother; about nine times in the first and second chapters we have the little Child mentioned, not the Babe.<a name=296:15></a> Luke speaks about the Babe, but Matthew speaks about the little Child.<a name=296:16></a> Many other passages, as we had today, speak about and present the idea of children.<a name=296:17></a> The word 'child' is common gender, it may be male or female, but not so the word 'sons'.<a name=296:18></a> John speaks much of children; Matthew speaks about sons.<a name=296:19></a> John hardly speaks of sons at all.<a name=296:20></a> He

		speaks of the Son of God of course; he must speak of Him, but as to ourselves he speaks of us as children exclusively, except in one passage.<a name=297:1></a> But Matthew speaks of sons in this particular passage, and that is why I read it, in order to bring out the masculine side and that it is worked out in sons or in sonship, and that it goes to heaven.<a name=297:2></a> Children do not go to heaven.<a name=297:3></a> I am speaking now of how Scripture speaks, and Scripture never says they go to heaven as children.<a name=297:4></a> Understand that when I say that I am not overlooking the fact that the Lord said of children, of little ones, that "their angels in the heavens continually behold the face of my Father who is in the heavens", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:10">Matthew  18:10</a>.<a name=297:5></a> I am not forgetting that.<a name=297:6></a> Who can tell anything about the vast number of children that go to heaven in the physical sense?<a name=297:7></a> We have to leave that with God, and not forget that the Lord spoke about the little ones saying, "Their angels in the heavens continually behold the face of my Father who is in the heavens".<a name=297:8></a> It is the comfort of all mothers and fathers.<a name=297:9></a> But what I am speaking of is christianity.<a name=297:10></a> There are the children of the heathen and what not abroad in the world that God claims as His creatures; we have to leave that with God; He will do right with all such.<a name=297:11></a> But that does not touch at all what I am speaking of.<a name=297:12></a> I am speaking of christianity, and each christian who dies in the Lord goes to heaven as a son.<a name=297:13></a> The idea is going up, the masculine side is going up; the family side from the standpoint of children is down here.<a name=297:14></a> John says, "Beloved, now are we children of God, and what we shall be has not yet been manifested; we know that if it is manifested we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:2">1 John  3:2</a>.<a name=297:15></a> That is masculine.<a name=297:16></a> I want to keep to that point now so that we may have in mind that the assembly is in a masculine setting.<a name=297:17></a> In itself it is feminine, it is always feminine in the sense of gender when it is spoken of

		as a person; for instance, the Lamb's wife, the holy city, the heavenly city descending from God out of heaven adorned as a bride for her husband.<a name=298:1></a> That is feminine.<a name=298:2></a> But Matthew is viewing it from the administrative side, dear brethren; I want you to keep on that line for the moment, and that must be in the main masculine; not that the feminine is shut out, because the virtuous woman in Proverbs is a great administrator.<a name=298:3></a> She is a woman, but her husband is absent; yet he is known here, he is known in the gates, that is where judgment is carried on, where government is carried on as seen with Boaz.<a name=298:4></a> The masculine side is presented in him.<a name=298:5></a> There he was in the gate.<a name=298:6></a> The transaction as regards Ruth was in the gate of the city; it was an administrative matter and so Matthew is an administrative matter.<a name=298:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am speaking tonight just because of that: that we might all see that we have part in this administrative matter, be we sisters or brothers.<a name=298:8></a> I need only to cite 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians and Ephesians to prove all this, and Revelation too; indeed the whole history of the testimony is the masculine and the feminine so that it is said that "God created Man in his image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:27">Genesis  1:27</a>.<a name=298:9></a> And He said to them, "Have dominion", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:26">Genesis  1:26</a>.<a name=298:10></a> He said it to both of them, so that the sisters and the brothers have to learn to have dominion; but there are things said about the sisters or about women, about the feminine side, that are intended to govern our minds as to the effect of femininity in this world.<a name=298:11></a> We cannot say that God could not do without it, But I would not say He could do without it; it is according to His purpose.<a name=298:12></a> The word 'man' covers both male and female, and God said, "Let them have dominion".<a name=298:13></a> But in the third book of the Bible God said that when a man-child is born the mother has to be unclean for seven days and then for thirty-three days;

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You may say, Why are you saying all that?<a name=299:5></a> One reason particularly is because woman is so exalted at the present time.<a name=299:6></a> Now let the dear sisters here not think I am saying one word derogatory to the female sex; I am not.<a name=299:7></a> I am only speaking from the word of God, and God shows us in what I quoted from Leviticus that much more serious consequences flow from the feminine side.<a name=299:8></a> If they do not know it they should know it now and think about it and control themselves, so as not to lend themselves to the spirit of this world.<a name=299:9></a> It is only in the assembly that you get the right thought about everything.<a name=299:10></a> Of course you get the right thoughts in the heavens, but as regards persons and things we can only get the right thought in the assembly.<a name=299:11></a> We get the truth about man and woman and children and about nations; we get the truth about all in the assembly.<a name=299:12></a> The all-various wisdom of God is seen there by the most exalted creatures; that is, the angels in heaven see all this.<a name=299:13></a> The all-various wisdom of God is portrayed and worked out in the assembly, and it is for sisters and brothers alike to see that they belong to that and to control themselves according to that, so that they can be used according to that.<a name=299:14></a> Think of the magnitude of what I am saying, and that you yourself belong to it as I do, thank God!<a name=299:15></a> But that is not all: the question is to be available to God for

		this great matter that He is working out at the present time.<a name=300:1></a> Matthew has this in mind, so that there we have a great deal about Joseph.<a name=300:2></a> Why should Matthew tell us more about Joseph than Luke does?<a name=300:3></a> Surely for a purpose; he is going to speak of the assembly not as the bride of Christ but as the great administrator of the universe presently; that she is to administer.<a name=300:4></a> So that the sisters too have to do with administration in the assembly now, and that is a most serious matter as to our conduct.<a name=300:5></a> We have had the matter of conduct before us today, that is, it works out in the idea of walk and education and affiliations and fellowship so that God should have something, should have material, workable material for the great purpose He has in hand.<a name=300:6></a> He is doing one thing at a time; other things are held in abeyance until the great matter is finished.<a name=300:7></a> So Paul puts himself forward as the completer of the word of God, and the completer of every man too, to present every man perfect in Christ; and he lays great stress in certain epistles, especially in Corinthians and Ephesians, on the female side.<a name=300:8></a> He stresses obedience, because without obedience in either male or female God has no material with which to work.<a name=300:9></a> He created the earth out of nothing, but not the assembly; He does not create that from nothing.<a name=300:10></a> He did not create Eve from nothing.<a name=300:11></a> He created Adam from clay, from dust, but He did not create Eve from dust; He created her from a part of Adam so that He might have something in the way of material for what He is doing.<a name=300:12></a> It is a question of the antitypes now for us.<a name=300:13></a> What is the potential part of the epistles but to bring out this very thing, to perfect the assembly, to make it useable for the purpose God has in mind.<a name=300:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, as I said, Matthew makes a great deal of Joseph, I mean relatively a great deal.<a name=300:15></a> The first thing he says of him is that he is a righteous man,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=301>[Page 301]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and he was righteous in regard of his wife.<a name=301:1></a> He was most careful, most sensitive, most tender in regard of her, exposed as she was.<a name=301:2></a> And then in chapter 2 he is entrusted with the mother and the Son, the little Child Jesus and His mother; they are both entrusted to Joseph.<a name=301:3></a> He takes the little Child to Egypt and God is there with Him, and when Archelaus died He sent Joseph back.<a name=301:4></a> Joseph knew enough to go back and he did go back; he was careful about his precious trust.<a name=301:5></a> That is what I am speaking about, the infinite preciousness of that trust; Joseph was such that God could trust him with such a precious commodity (I am speaking reverently of our Lord Jesus) and His mother, the little Child and His mother.<a name=301:6></a> If I speak to you about that dear little Child, that worshipful little Child -- because in chapter 2 He is seen as worshipful -- let us never forget that the Lord Jesus is to be worshipped.<a name=301:7></a> The wise men said, "We .<a name=301:8></a>.<a name=301:9></a>.<a name=301:10></a> are come to worship him", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#2:1">Matthew  2:1</a> let us never forget that; it is put down in the very beginning of Matthew and rightly in Matthew.<a name=301:11></a> It fits there.<a name=301:12></a> We have to learn to worship the Lord Jesus; let us never forget it.<a name=301:13></a> The wise men not only came to do it abstractly, but they brought things by which they could do it: myrrh and other precious things that could be used for the worship of the Lord Jesus.<a name=301:14></a> They had in their minds to worship the King; not the Child simply, but the King.<a name=301:15></a> If only a little child in appearance, in their minds He was a King; and so He was and ever will be an Object of worship.<a name=301:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#1">Matthew  1</a>and 2 furnishes all this and a good deal more on the same line: how little children from two years and under were taken account of by Herod and how his wicked murderous attack was all aimed at the Lord Jesus to murder Him.<a name=301:17></a> It is really wonderful that God should entrust Joseph with the Child in view of the terrible hatred of Herod and others against Him; the precious Child, that He

		Well now, I go on to chapter 17 because that is what I read, and I just wanted to show how sonship is stressed in it.<a name=302:14></a> The writer of the epistle to the Hebrews says, "For it became him, for whom are all things and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory .<a name=302:15></a>.<a name=302:16></a>.<a name=302:17></a>", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:10">Hebrews  2:10</a>.<a name=302:18></a> That is my point, that He is bringing sons to glory.<a name=302:19></a> He is not bringing children to glory.<a name=302:20></a> It is the same Person but He is bringing sons to glory; it is just to impress us with that point that I now dwell for a short time on these verses.<a name=302:21></a> It is a chapter of great facts; it is

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=307:1></a> Within recent times the Lord seems to have made a great point of John's gospel in view of the service of God.<a name=307:2></a> We shall consider it not as a whole but from the 8th to the 15th chapters.<a name=307:3></a> It is known to most of us that John's gospel is peculiarly divided into chapters and subjects.<a name=307:4></a> The divisions into paragraphs and verses in the New Translation are usually accurate, so that this section may be treated as a special section by itself.<a name=307:5></a> The subjects are distinct; this one is very distinct.<a name=307:6></a> The previous chapter closes with the words, "And every one went to his home.<a name=307:7></a> But Jesus went to the mount of Olives", <a href="../bible/John.htm#7:53">John  7:53</a> and then we have an incident of great importance morally and God doubtless would help us as to the significance of it.<a name=307:8></a> The significance of John's gospel cannot be overstated at this time.<a name=307:9></a> These sections lead up to the truth of the Holy Spirit, who is introduced in chapter 14, but the thought now is to look into this chapter because of its moral significance.<a name=307:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=307:11></a> Would this chapter help us in relation to things being clear on the moral side before proceeding further?<a name=307:12></a> It is essential the moral side should be clear, is it not?<a name=307:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=307:14></a> Well, it is.<a name=307:15></a> The position the Lord takes up is significant.<a name=307:16></a> In regard to the generality of the people, every one went to his own home; that is to say the Lord is left, as if He were not of special importance.<a name=307:17></a> But then He Himself takes up a position, "Jesus went to the mount of Olives" <a href="../bible/John.htm#7:53">John  7:53</a>; as if He were, for the moment at least, in relation with His Father.<a name=307:18></a> The mount of Olives denotes a spiritual setting, and the Lord intends to say something about what was to happen.<a name=307:19></a> He knew what would happen and in view of it we have, "And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came to him; and he sat down and taught them.<a name=307:20></a> And the scribes and the Pharisees bring to him a woman".<a name=307:21></a>

		Now this incident so well known to the brethren is questioned by many critics, but it is clearly the truth; it is clearly Scripture.<a name=308:1></a> The Lord's attitude is what is in mind because it implies the moral side of the truth, how grace deals with incidents as they arise in the human family and especially among those who are professedly the Lord's people.<a name=308:2></a>

		C.H.<a name=308:3></a>H.<a name=308:4></a> Is there anything in the fact that in chapter 7 He walks no longer in Judaea but enters into Galilee, and then in the next chapter we have the mount of Olives?<a name=308:5></a> Would it indicate that there was a change from what was of the law to what was spiritual?<a name=308:6></a> The mount of Olives was to supersede what the Lord spoke of in the moral question.<a name=308:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=308:8></a> I think that is the point, that the Lord makes His own selections as to position.<a name=308:9></a> These paragraphs are not accidents.<a name=308:10></a> It says, "Jesus went to the mount of Olives".<a name=308:11></a> If we take that up in a geographical sense there is not much in it, but if it is a spiritual matter there is a great deal in it.<a name=308:12></a> In a literal sense it was just a mount on the east side of Jerusalem to which the Lord was accustomed to go; but undoubtedly it is of spiritual significance and that enters into what is related in the following passages.<a name=308:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.F.<a name=308:14></a> Would you say that the Lord's ministry as coming from the mount of Olives would be definitely against what was merely formal or legal as represented by the Pharisees?<a name=308:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=308:16></a> Very true; and they did not tell Him to go there; it was His own doing.<a name=308:17></a> Others went to their own homes, but then they came again to the temple in the morning, showing that there is some interest which the Lord sees.<a name=308:18></a> Then it says, "The scribes and the Pharisees bring to him a woman taken in adultery, and having set her in the midst, they say to him, Teacher .<a name=308:19></a>.<a name=308:20></a>.<a name=308:21></a>".<a name=308:22></a> These are the facts and it is a question

		J.T.<a name=311:2></a> It would be if you made much of the word 'Lord'; the first title is Lord and the next is Christ, and God is related to them both.<a name=311:3></a> The Lord's position in that sense is given by God.<a name=311:4></a> But this passage in John involves what He is in Himself; that is to say, if He dies, He dies; He has title to do it.<a name=311:5></a> The Father gave Him title to do it, to give Himself up, to give His life for the sheep.<a name=311:6></a> But it is Himself in John's gospel generally; it is not what He is made, but what He is.<a name=311:7></a> He is the Creator of the universe.<a name=311:8></a> "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God", <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:1">John  1:1</a>.<a name=311:9></a> All things were created by Him and nothing was created without Him, so that He is the Creator of the universe and yet He is doing this.<a name=311:10></a> He is going to deal with sin but He is stooping down to do it; He is stooping down to expose what men are and bring conviction into men's consciences as to sin so that there might be room for the Spirit to operate.<a name=311:11></a> The point in John's gospel is largely the operations of the Spirit with the Lord's own.<a name=311:12></a> So unless anyone is born of the Spirit he does not see the kingdom of God.<a name=311:13></a> Room must be made for the Spirit and that implies that there must be conviction of sin.<a name=311:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=323:1></a> You will notice the movements of the Lord here.<a name=323:2></a> It says, "as he passed on", as if to indicate that it is deliberate from His own side; and then it speaks of what He saw.<a name=323:3></a> It is not simply that His attention is called to it but it says, "He saw a man blind from birth".<a name=323:4></a> The disciples enquire as to this, assuming that there must be some cause for the blindness either in the man himself or in his parents.<a name=323:5></a> That is to say they conclude that what happens here in relation to the government of God must be causative, whereas God may act sovereignly in these cases; and in this case it is clearly to bring out what God can do for man in these conditions that are found in the race.<a name=323:6></a> As we consider the extent of the race, how numerous it is and what happenings there are!<a name=323:7></a> The Lord is indicating here that He can act sovereignly without regard to the parents' history.<a name=323:8></a> It is a question of what God can do, what He is entitled to do if He wishes to.<a name=323:9></a> It is a question of the sovereign works of God which are beneficial, for it is said the Lord went about doing good for God was with Him.<a name=323:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=323:11></a>Jr.<a name=323:12></a> Would the works of God be a subjective idea?<a name=323:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=323:14></a> I suppose that is what we are bound to conclude because it is the subject really of this chapter.<a name=323:15></a> This matter is great enough in the divine mind to develop into the subject of the chapter.<a name=323:16></a> The Spirit of God tells us certain things that happened and what moral effect the happenings had on the man.<a name=323:17></a> The moral effect is that he becomes a believer, not like the woman in the previous chapter; it is not said that she became a believer, but he became a believer for the Lord said to him, "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?<a name=323:18></a>".<a name=323:19></a> It was in the Lord's mind that this should be brought out.<a name=323:20></a> So the question now is

		as to believing, whether we believe what we are saying this afternoon, or whether unbelief is something that may mark ourselves.<a name=324:1></a> Does what is said bring out what is of God and faith?<a name=324:2></a> Are we developing faith?<a name=324:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=324:4></a> Is it suggestive that in the body of this great gospel we should have two incidents that are arranged for a certain purpose in the divine mind -- in this chapter in view of the works of God and in chapter 11 in view of the glory of God?<a name=324:5></a> Is there something significant in the selection of incidents with these things in view?<a name=324:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=324:7></a> Just so.<a name=324:8></a> After this chapter we have the question of the sheep, the outcome of faith being to make one a sheep, constituting a believer a sheep.<a name=324:9></a> And then in chapter 11 we have the glory: the sickness was not unto death but for the glory of God.<a name=324:10></a> Is that what you have in mind?<a name=324:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=324:12></a> Exactly.<a name=324:13></a> Certain things were operative in view of divine thoughts being worked out, not just occurring in any haphazard way.<a name=324:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=324:15></a> You see spiritual regularity throughout the book.<a name=324:16></a> It is remarkable to see the subjects brought out as they are and how they are placed spiritually.<a name=324:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		R.W.<a name=324:18></a>S.<a name=324:19></a> In the first reading we were engaged with the women and the basic way the Lord met the sin question in being lifted up.<a name=324:20></a> Are we now to free our minds of the sin question entirely and see what God is doing apart from it?<a name=324:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=324:22></a> Just so.<a name=324:23></a> It is said, "Neither has this man sinned nor his parents, but that the works of God should be manifested in him".<a name=324:24></a> Not simply the work of God, as is frequently stated, but the <i>works</i> of God; the whole subject of the works of God enters into the matter.<a name=324:25></a> The works of God are greater than the creation, as having a moral bearing.<a name=324:26></a> Jesus is the One accomplishing the works of God, He is the Operator.<a name=324:27></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=325:4></a> Just so.<a name=325:5></a> It is a question of God doing such works, not what He did in creation.<a name=325:6></a> We can hardly say much about that because it is so far back.<a name=325:7></a> John says, "In the beginning was the Word"; <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:1">John  1:1</a> but then subsequent to that (I mean subsequent as to moral sequence), "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:1">Genesis  1:1</a>.<a name=325:8></a> We have something definite that He did; but before that, "In the beginning was the Word".<a name=325:9></a> It is "was", without saying what He did.<a name=325:10></a> Now here we have works; it is a question of God still but we have works.<a name=325:11></a> The man did not sin nor his parents, "but that the works of God should be manifested"; that is, not simply that they should be done but manifested.<a name=325:12></a> The thing should be seen.<a name=325:13></a>

		C.T.<a name=325:14></a> Is there urgency attached to this?<a name=325:15></a> It says, "that the works of God should be manifested in him.<a name=325:16></a> I must work the works of him that has sent me while it is day".<a name=325:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=325:18></a> Just so, because it is daytime.<a name=325:19></a> "The night is coming, when no one can work".<a name=325:20></a> God works in the day and therefore it is said, "God called the light Day".<a name=325:21></a> "God said, Let there be light .<a name=325:22></a>.<a name=325:23></a>.<a name=325:24></a> And God called the light Day", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:3">Genesis  1:3</a>,5.<a name=325:25></a> That is to say, the first day it was a question of light and things were to happen in the light, not in the dark.<a name=325:26></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.L.<a name=325:27></a>P.<a name=325:28></a> Would the passage in <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2">Philippians  2</a>fit in here, "For it is God who works in you both the willing and the working according to his good pleasure"?<a name=325:29></a> <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:13">Philippians  2:13</a>.<a name=325:30></a> Mr.<a name=325:31></a> Darby has a note in regard to "God who works" which says, 'internal operation of power, though seen in results'.<a name=325:32></a>

		this man was not a christian yet; this was in the Lord's own lifetime here, but Philippians refers to what is happening since the Spirit of God has come down.<a name=326:1></a> The Lord speaks of this time as greater than when He was here: "And he shall do greater than these, because I go to the Father", <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:12">John  14:12</a>.<a name=326:2></a> That is what is going on now in this dispensation; it is a question of what God is doing through the Spirit and it has in mind what is to work out in the assembly.<a name=326:3></a> Here it is what the Lord does Himself to manifest the works of God.<a name=326:4></a> I am trying to stress the idea of manifestation, what a place it has in the divine operations, that is to say, what God's works are.<a name=326:5></a> As to the creation -- we cannot say it was the beginning as to sequence, because before that, "In the beginning was the Word", <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:1">John  1:1</a>.<a name=326:6></a> The next movement is more the actual creation according to the facts of the case and the details given.<a name=326:7></a> The facts are that "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth"; <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:1">Genesis  1:1</a> but here it is a question of the moral character of things and that it is to be manifested; as if God had peculiar pleasure in what is to be done now; it is the peculiar time for the works of God.<a name=326:8></a>

		S.J.<a name=327:3></a>H.<a name=327:4></a> Chapter 8 would show the dryness of the ground; there was no mist in evidence.<a name=327:5></a> It was so dry that the Lord wrote on the ground.<a name=327:6></a> But here in a limited way He moistens it and accomplishes something.<a name=327:7></a> Would that be right?<a name=327:8></a> He spits upon the ground; He has come into Manhood; He has brought something in.<a name=327:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=327:10></a> The Lord spits, just so, it is a remarkable thing; it is what comes out of the Lord Himself.<a name=327:11></a> It is a remarkable background for the way He is going to work, how He is going to operate.<a name=327:12></a> He made clay of the spittle.<a name=327:13></a> Now there was no rain on the earth before the flood as far as we know, but there was a mist that rose up and of course that would make way for the creation of man.<a name=327:14></a> The Lord created man out of the ground and evidently the formation was there before the breath was there.<a name=327:15></a> He "breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and Man became a living soul", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:7">Genesis  2:7</a>.<a name=327:16></a> But all that was in the time of the mist, and the mist would refer to something subjective to make the ground suitable for the divine operations.<a name=327:17></a>

		J.T.<a name=349:2></a> Well, that becomes a very interesting inquiry.<a name=349:3></a> I think we should approach it now simply, including the thought of sonship, because the idea of sonship is earlier: "The only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, <i>he</i> hath declared him", <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:18">John  1:18</a>.<a name=349:4></a> The preposition 'in' signifies that He has entered into that position.<a name=349:5></a> That is not what He was eternally; He has entered into it.<a name=349:6></a>

		J.T.<a name=349:11></a> I think so; there is some intelligence about it.<a name=349:12></a> We have referred to chapter 6, but then I am going back further to chapter 1 as to "the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father", <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:18">John  1:18</a>.<a name=349:13></a> How did He get there?<a name=349:14></a> Now chapter 10 raises this whole question as to how He got there and whether He is entitled to be opened to, whether He is entitled to a place such as we are in this afternoon without any official position outside at all.<a name=349:15></a> There is no official here, there are no formally constituted elders; we are here because of intelligence that we have, that we have acquired in some way, maybe in our houses and among our families; but we have acquired it in some sense.<a name=349:16></a> The porter is opening to us; that is, he opens the door to persons like ourselves because we belong to the sheep.<a name=349:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=369:1></a> The thought now is to pass on from the idea of sheep to that of a family, a human family, so that we have terms immediately relating to the Father and the Son and the saints; not that the saints themselves are called sons in this connection, but children, because it is a question of family.<a name=369:2></a> Sonship is not the point in John's gospel, except in regard to Christ; it is not attributable to ourselves in John's writings save in the book of Revelation.<a name=369:3></a> What is applicable to us as in the family is 'children', as the prophecy of Caiaphas says, "Ye know nothing nor consider that it is profitable for you that one man die for the people, and not that the whole nation perish.<a name=369:4></a> But this he did not say of himself; but, being high priest that year, prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation; and not for the nation only, but that he should also gather together into one the children of God who were scattered abroad", <a href="../bible/John.htm#11:50">John  11:50</a> - 52.<a name=369:5></a> That is prophecy; it is clearly a prophecy because Caiaphas was high priest at that time.<a name=369:6></a> It stated that the Lord died not only for the nation but to gather together the children of God scattered abroad, which would include ourselves.<a name=369:7></a> Therefore chapter 12 opens up the thought of children, of the family of God.<a name=369:8></a> There were three in the family, but it was without a head, you might say, because it consisted of a brother and two sisters, not a father and mother.<a name=369:9></a> But the Lord Jesus becomes the Father; He becomes the head of the family.<a name=369:10></a> That is in a simple way what is in mind, to pass on to the idea of a family.<a name=369:11></a> It says, "Jesus therefore, six days before the passover, came to Bethany, where was the dead man Lazarus, whom Jesus raised from among the dead.<a name=369:12></a> There therefore they made him a supper, and Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those at table with him".<a name=369:13></a> So

		that it is a resurrection scene, not an ascension scene; and Lazarus represents a risen man.<a name=370:1></a> Then there are the services of the sisters, and so Mary comes in and Martha; and then there is the devil's effort to interfere through Judas.<a name=370:2></a> But the position is maintained and the Lord is at the table and Lazarus is there who had been dead.<a name=370:3></a> The word is really 'the dead Lazarus'; he had really been dead, but he is now alive; so that the position is clearly maintained.<a name=370:4></a> Surely it is a matter for us to consider that we belong to a family; not simply that we come in under the figure of sheep -- while that holds as characteristic -- but that it is a question of men.<a name=370:5></a> Here it is a family of a man and two women; one of them had been dead and is now alive.<a name=370:6></a> It is a question of a person raised from the dead, the principle being the position of the assembly now as we are risen with Christ.<a name=370:7></a> We are risen with Christ according to Colossians.<a name=370:8></a> In Ephesians we go further.<a name=370:9></a>

		J.T.<a name=370:13></a> That is what is in mind; it is not the sons exactly, but the family.<a name=370:14></a> It is worked out in the epistles of John, especially the first epistle.<a name=370:15></a>
