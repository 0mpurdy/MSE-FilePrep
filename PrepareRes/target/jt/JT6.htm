		THE CONFLICT
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#12">Revelation  12</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My thought is to seek to open up to you in a measure the circumstances and occasion of the Conflict, and I read this chapter because, as I understand it, it sets forth the great parties engaged, and also the great principles which are involved in it.<a name=1:1></a> I think that the Spirit of God would produce exercise amongst God's people, that we may take our part in the conflict.<a name=1:2></a> I believe, if the persons engaged, and the principles involved in it are understood, that every true Christian heart will not fail to come forward, but I do not think that what is to be contended for is much understood.<a name=1:3></a> It is not this doctrine or that doctrine, it is what is in God's mind to carry out in connection with, and through, a Man, whether it be on earth or in heaven.<a name=1:4></a> Directly that Man is called attention to, the conflict begins.<a name=1:5></a> I refer for the moment to <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#2">Matthew  2</a>.<a name=1:6></a> It is parallel with the opening verses of the chapter I read.<a name=1:7></a> You will all remember how in a most remarkable way Jesus is called attention to, as certain men from the East arrive at Jerusalem.<a name=1:8></a> They had light in their souls as to Christ.<a name=1:9></a> They had seen His star in the East; the stars are guides at night.<a name=1:10></a> These men were accustomed to stars, and they saw the star of Jesus in the East and came to Jerusalem, and made known to the king that they had seen the star of Him who was born King of the Jews.<a name=1:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I refer to that to show you how the conflict really begins.<a name=1:12></a> We may introduce the opening of <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#12">Revelation  12</a>into <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#2">Matthew  2</a>.<a name=1:13></a> Here is a woman who represented the mind of God with regard to the earth.<a name=1:14></a> She is clothed with the sun.<a name=1:15></a> What a testimony!<a name=1:16></a> She has the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.<a name=1:17></a> She represents

		<a name=2>[Page 2]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Israel as the centre of God's government on earth.<a name=2:1></a> There was the sun, suggesting supreme authority, and the moon, subordinate authority, and the twelve stars, administrative authority, all connected with the woman.<a name=2:2></a> God had His thoughts, and they all circle around this woman.<a name=2:3></a> How one would be exercised to convey the mind of God to souls.<a name=2:4></a> He has given expression to it, and He is never for one moment to be diverted from it.<a name=2:5></a> We know what a time we are living in, a moment of great activity, and one would appeal to the Lord's people, that we might withdraw from it all into the mind of God.<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to show you that the woman is not the real object of the enemy's attack, though she becomes that in the end of the chapter.<a name=2:7></a> We can see plainly in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#2">Matthew  2</a>that the wrath of the wicked one was excited by the testimony of those who had seen the star of Jesus.<a name=2:8></a> They had seen His star in the East and they followed it, and their testimony drew forth the innate hatred of the opposer.<a name=2:9></a> The Man-child was there, and the Man-child is the object of attack.<a name=2:10></a> Directly the Man-child is mentioned in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#12">Revelation  12</a>, His destiny is declared by the Spirit; it was He "who shall shepherd all the nations with an iron rod".<a name=2:11></a> Let us think of that word <i>shepherd</i>, He is not to destroy, but to <i>shepherd</i> the nations.<a name=2:12></a> That word opens up a flood of light in the Scriptures.<a name=2:13></a> It is to be noticed that directly He is introduced by the Spirit of God you have stated what He is to do, and that draws forth the hatred of the dragon, for he would devour the Man-child.<a name=2:14></a> Wherever there is a movement toward Christ you will always find that there is serious opposition.<a name=2:15></a> The Man-child, not the woman, is the object of attack; for the dragon is prepared to devour the Man-child.<a name=2:16></a> All the names of the dragon are given here, for it is well to have the foe rightly identified and located.<a name=2:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My desire is to engage you with the Man-child;
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=3>[Page 3]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He has a shepherd's heart.<a name=3:1></a> He is caught up to <i>God</i> and to God's throne, not the throne of Jerusalem; that was occupied by Herod, and Herod had not a shepherd's heart.<a name=3:2></a> No occupier of any throne in this world today has a shepherd's heart, but <i>God's King</i> has a shepherd's heart, and that Man goes up to God and to His throne.<a name=3:3></a> He is morally great enough to occupy God's throne.<a name=3:4></a> The throne of David publicly was occupied by Herod, and he had nothing like a shepherd's heart in him; <i>nothing</i>.<a name=3:5></a> Herod had the heart of a murderer.<a name=3:6></a> The dragon found his counterpart in Herod, and he has many counterparts at the present time.<a name=3:7></a> Herod was a ready vessel for the dragon on account of the state of his heart.<a name=3:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the Spirit's description of the dragon, we read that he has seven heads and ten horns; the ten horns are symbolical of kings.<a name=3:9></a> It shows us what all the kings of the earth will do in the future; they will support him who is the direct impersonation of the dragon.<a name=3:10></a> They will give their support to the beast to carry out the dragon's designs in opposition to Christ.<a name=3:11></a> What is the secret of it?<a name=3:12></a> It is the state of their hearts.<a name=3:13></a> Herod's heart was full of envy.<a name=3:14></a> The light of God had come into the dark East and illuminated these men with regard to the Man-child.<a name=3:15></a> The star guided them to Bethlehem, not to Jerusalem.<a name=3:16></a> See the devotedness of these men; they found the little Child with Mary, His mother, and they opened their treasures and they worshipped.<a name=3:17></a> What a testimony!<a name=3:18></a> Compare that with the heart of Herod, which was a ready instrument for the dragon.<a name=3:19></a> He would destroy the Man-child, but He is taken care of by God.<a name=3:20></a> He is caught up to God's throne.<a name=3:21></a> What light that gives!<a name=3:22></a> God's throne is occupied by Him who has a shepherd's heart!<a name=3:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I wish to enlarge upon that.<a name=3:24></a> We may introduce here the death and resurrection and ascension of Christ, and His relation with His people.<a name=3:25></a> What

		did Christ take up to heaven?<a name=4:1></a> He went up to heaven with the saints on His heart.<a name=4:2></a> You remember the breastplate of the high priest; the high priest went into the holiest with the names of the twelve tribes on his heart.<a name=4:3></a> What a wonderful thought that is!<a name=4:4></a> Now I want to show you that the scene of the conflict is transferred from earth to heaven.<a name=4:5></a> If the Man-child goes up to heaven, the conflict is necessarily transferred from earth to heaven, and in a sense it centres in what is in Christ's heart; for the anti-priest comes to light in heaven.<a name=4:6></a> It was not upon the earth that the dragon accused the saints.<a name=4:7></a> The ruthless destruction on the part of Herod was on earth, but there is nothing of that kind in heaven.<a name=4:8></a> What is the dragon's opposition there?<a name=4:9></a> Accusation.<a name=4:10></a> Christ went up to heaven with the saints on His heart in order to represent them before God, and immediately the accuser appears; that is the present moment.<a name=4:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are told in verse 7 that there is war in heaven.<a name=4:12></a> We can quite understand that.<a name=4:13></a> If the introduction of the Man-child brought about conflict on earth, it must necessarily follow into heaven.<a name=4:14></a> So there was war in heaven.<a name=4:15></a> Now what I would say, beloved friends, is, that we are of the heavenly warriors, and our qualifications for the conflict have all to be learnt from Christ.<a name=4:16></a> I make bold to say that our understanding of what is in the heart of Christ is the secret of our qualification.<a name=4:17></a> He went into heaven with the saints in His heart; they were all there; not one omitted.<a name=4:18></a> The affection that Christ had for the saints was intolerant of the accuser in heaven.<a name=4:19></a> There was war in heaven, not now upon earth, for the scene is changed.<a name=4:20></a> I have often thought that a good warrior selects his own battle-field.<a name=4:21></a> God has had the scene of conflict transferred from earth to heaven, but war on earth will begin when God resumes His relationship with Jerusalem.<a name=4:22></a>

		Now I want to engage you with the greatness of

		the position.<a name=5:1></a> We have Michael introduced.<a name=5:2></a> He is presented as leader, and he has his followers.<a name=5:3></a> I do not pretend to interpret the passage, but I call your attention to this, that the Lord Jesus is the great Leader of the war.<a name=5:4></a> Gideon said, as you will remember, "As I do, so shall ye do".<a name=5:5></a> If you would be a warrior, you must learn from the leader.<a name=5:6></a> Joshua was a leader, but he had to learn from the great Leader how to be a soldier in the ranks.<a name=5:7></a> You remember how Joshua, when he was by Jericho, was met by a man with a drawn sword, and Joshua said, "Art thou for us or our adversaries?<a name=5:8></a>" What a reply he got.<a name=5:9></a> The us is the secret of all partyism.<a name=5:10></a> The reply is, "Nay, but as captain of the host of the Lord am I now come".<a name=5:11></a> "Loose thy shoe from off thy foot, for the place whereon thou standest is holy".<a name=5:12></a> It is not a question of us, it is a question of the Lord's host and the Captain.<a name=5:13></a> It was as if He said to Joshua, "Are you with me?<a name=5:14></a>" What an appeal!<a name=5:15></a> "Nay, but as captain of the host of the Lord am I now come".<a name=5:16></a> That is the position.<a name=5:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To return to our scripture in Revelation, we are told that, "there was war in the heaven".<a name=5:18></a> Michael fought.<a name=5:19></a> He had contended with the devil for the body of Moses, and here he contends with Satan for the heavenly position.<a name=5:20></a> The issue is tremendous.<a name=5:21></a> Satan is cast out, and his angels cast out too.<a name=5:22></a> It is a war for the complete and entire clearance of the heavens from all that is adverse to God's people.<a name=5:23></a> The result is, "Now is come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God".<a name=5:24></a> Why?<a name=5:25></a> The accuser of our brethren is cast out.<a name=5:26></a> The accuser.<a name=5:27></a> Now notice what is said about him, "who accused them before our God day and night".<a name=5:28></a> That is what the dragon is doing.<a name=5:29></a> It is a question for us to decide as to whether we are with the great High Priest, or with the anti-priest.<a name=5:30></a> The great High Priest has the saints in His heart, and the anti-priest accuses

		them before God.<a name=6:1></a> It is a terrible thing to be an accuser of God's people.<a name=6:2></a> We little realise how such influences in heaven affect us here.<a name=6:3></a> The apostle said, "we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places".<a name=6:4></a> That is what we are called to.<a name=6:5></a> I have no doubt it is a great privilege to take our place in the ranks of the warriors with the great Leader of the war.<a name=6:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I will touch just for a moment upon that which is to mark the warriors.<a name=6:7></a> You remember the passage that is often quoted from <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#6">Ephesians  6</a>.<a name=6:8></a> We are told there to "Put on the whole armour of God".<a name=6:9></a> In telling us about this armour, the apostle speaks firstly of our loins, then of our breasts, then of our feet.<a name=6:10></a> What exercising thoughts these are!<a name=6:11></a> Our loins are to be "girt about with truth".<a name=6:12></a> What a servant a man is whose loins are girt about with truth!<a name=6:13></a> Such service is most blessed.<a name=6:14></a> Saints suffer enormously from having their affections loose.<a name=6:15></a> How intensely practical to be girt about with truth; the affections braced up as it were, and then the breast is taken care of; and you must have a good conscience.<a name=6:16></a> Satan has no opportunity of attack if righteousness is maintained.<a name=6:17></a> And then see that your feet are right.<a name=6:18></a> How many of the saints' feet are found in by-paths.<a name=6:19></a> Our feet are to be"shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace".<a name=6:20></a> That does not mean that we are all evangelists, but we are to be prepared to speak a word to souls.<a name=6:21></a> And then we have to take the shield of faith.<a name=6:22></a> That is a wonderful thing.<a name=6:23></a> I cannot enlarge upon it, but it is a wonderful thing if you are called into the ranks of the Leader of the war.<a name=6:24></a> Faith quenches all the fiery darts of the wicked one.<a name=6:25></a> Then you have the helmet of salvation on your head.<a name=6:26></a> You lift up your head.<a name=6:27></a> You need never be ashamed in the light of what Christ is, and in the

		hope of His appearing.<a name=7:1></a> Then you pray always for all saints, you embrace all, but especially those who are engaged in the testimony of the gospel, and the mystery.<a name=7:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now see the issue!<a name=7:3></a> There, is complete clearance of the heavens.<a name=7:4></a> What a triumph!<a name=7:5></a> What can be compared with the result.<a name=7:6></a> The accuser of the brethren cast out; he who accused them day and night before God.<a name=7:7></a> Then the celebration is, that "Now is come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ".<a name=7:8></a> The occasion of praise is for the inhabitants of heavenly places, the saints of the present dispensation, the companions of Him who has been caught up there.<a name=7:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In closing, I just want to touch upon the change in the sphere of warfare.<a name=7:10></a> Satan being cast out, there is increased activity, not now against the Man-child, but against the woman who bore Him, but she is taken care of; she is given wings.<a name=7:11></a> Wings are symbolical of power.<a name=7:12></a> God gives her power; He takes care of her for three and a half years in the desert.<a name=7:13></a> Then we have the remnant of her seed who keep the commandments of God.<a name=7:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us now look at the remnant in a practical way.<a name=7:15></a> What is said of them is, that they "keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus".<a name=7:16></a> In other words, they have come to learn of Christ.<a name=7:17></a> They are not heavenly warriors; they never will be.<a name=7:18></a> Their warfare is through their sufferings; they are persecuted and they suffer.<a name=7:19></a> Why?<a name=7:20></a> Because they keep the commandments of God.<a name=7:21></a> What a result there will be for God!<a name=7:22></a> When you consider what that nation is now, what has been its history, and what it will be.<a name=7:23></a> Judah bore the Man-child, the Firstborn, and all that follow take character from the first.<a name=7:24></a> You remember Isaiah alludes to it in chapter 66.<a name=7:25></a> "Before she travailed, she brought forth, before her pain came, she was delivered of a man child .<a name=7:26></a>.<a name=7:27></a>.<a name=7:28></a> as

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is well that we should understand that we are at the end of the dispensation.<a name=8:14></a> The occasion of the conflict is just as it was at the beginning, there is no change.<a name=8:15></a> God never gives up His thoughts.<a name=8:16></a> God's people on earth cherish every divine thought.<a name=8:17></a> It is not simply that we are externally correct.<a name=8:18></a> Every divine thought is centred in the Man-child.<a name=8:19></a> Has <i>He</i> a place in your heart?<a name=8:20></a> It is not merely that you love Him because He has saved you from your sins, but God's thought is that the Person who is the centre of all His thoughts should have a place in our hearts.<a name=8:21></a> And directly Christ has that place in your heart, you may depend upon it, you become the object of the enemy's attack.<a name=8:22></a> That is what I understand to be the testimony.<a name=8:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What the Spirit contends for today is the maintenance of the mind of God.<a name=8:24></a> God has not given up <i>one thought</i>, either in regard to Christ in heaven, or the assembly, or Israel upon earth.<a name=8:25></a> The saints have the Lord Jesus in their hearts as the centre of all divine thoughts.<a name=8:26></a> The great advantage of instruction is seen in what the assembly can say when Christ

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"And the Spirit and the bride say, Come".<a name=9:6></a> Christ is the centre of all divine thoughts.<a name=9:7></a> We have to see to it that we give Him full place in our hearts.<a name=9:8></a> I have often said, 'If you look after the principles God will look after the people'.<a name=9:9></a> You stand by His principles and He will bring the people in.<a name=9:10></a> Look at Enoch!<a name=9:11></a> He walked with God, and he saw the Lord coming with ten thousand of His saints.<a name=9:12></a> Then God finds Abraham and calls him alone and He blesses him.<a name=9:13></a> But Abraham was not to be alone.<a name=9:14></a> He looked up at the stars and his seed was to be as the number of them, countless.<a name=9:15></a> We are not to be alone.<a name=9:16></a>

		J.T.<a name=10:1></a> What struck me in this chapter is the fact that the wise men found the little Child <i>with</i> His <i>mother</i>.<a name=10:2></a> The Spirit of God pursues this connection in the chapter; the angel directs Joseph to take the young Child, and His mother, and flee into Egypt and then, Herod being dead, to take the young Child and His mother and go into the land of Israel.<a name=10:3></a> It struck me as indicating the connection in which the Lord is ever found; He is found where He is loved.<a name=10:4></a> As here in this world He was the subject of God's unceasing care.<a name=10:5></a> If we see the place that Jesus has in the mind of heaven, as shown in the chapter before us, it will lead to a corresponding care for Him in our hearts.<a name=10:6></a> I thought especially in this connection of David in the Old Testament, for he represents our side, and his great aim was to prepare a place for the ark.<a name=10:7></a> There were no specific directions, it was a spontaneous act of his own.<a name=10:8></a> In the wilderness there were specific directions, for <i>there</i> it was a question of God's care for the ark.<a name=10:9></a> When we come to the time of David, the ark had been twenty years without attention; it had never been cared for by Saul.<a name=10:10></a> David, in his house of cedar, was led to think of the ark; it was in unsuitable surroundings, and there was a very great discrepancy between David's circumstances and those of the ark, and so he goes through exercise of heart with regard to it, and the prophet says to him, "Do all that is in thine heart".<a name=10:11></a> I thought that if we pursued this line it would help us.<a name=10:12></a>

		My thought is first of all to show how we are to distinguish between that which falls from heaven and that which <i>descends</i> from heaven, and then to speak more particularly of the latter and the effect of it in us.<a name=19:1></a> You can easily perceive that descending has reference to Christ, while falling has reference to the adversary, Satan.<a name=19:2></a> A very great difference exists between falling and descending.<a name=19:3></a> Christ descended from heaven and the assembly descends, or comes down from heaven, whereas Satan falls from heaven.<a name=19:4></a> Now a fallen being, one whom God has used and owned, as falling is sure to be filled with envy.<a name=19:5></a> There are many persons and things said to be fallen, and what I desire is that we may never be in accord with what is fallen.<a name=19:6></a> The whole world is in accord with what is fallen, whereas the world to come will be in accord with what descends.<a name=19:7></a> You remember in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21">Revelation  21</a>John saw "the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, having the glory of God".<a name=19:8></a> The glory of God is not in that which falls, but in that which descends, that which comes down "from God out of heaven".<a name=19:9></a> The city comes down!<a name=19:10></a> and she has the glory.<a name=19:11></a> All that will be seen in the world to come is to be in accord with that, in accord with that which "comes down from God out of heaven having the glory of God".<a name=19:12></a>

		sphere that we have to do with is characterised by falling, and what falls is sure to be marked by strife and envy, and that is a matter which has the most serious consequences.<a name=20:1></a> The world derives its character from an envious being, and envy is the nursery of every evil work.<a name=20:2></a> Satan filled the scene with envy when he fell; he was envious of God and of man who was the image of God.<a name=20:3></a> God brought in man and set him up in His own image and glory in an environment that indicated the kindness and love of God, and Satan was envious of that; he was envious of Adam, and he brought about the fall of Adam by injecting that principle into him, or rather into Eve's heart.<a name=20:4></a> He suggested to them that they should be as God.<a name=20:5></a>

		In view of the fact that divine things are made to depend for their continuance on the priesthood, what it involves is of immense importance.<a name=26:1></a> If the priestly state is absent, we really have nothing subjective according to God.<a name=26:2></a> It implies a state formed after Christ, viewed as Man on our side, One capable of sympathy, and One who loves God's people.<a name=26:3></a> One great feature of the high priest's dress was the breastplate and the two shoulderpieces.<a name=26:4></a> In the breastplate each of the tribes was inscribed, and on each of the shoulderpieces there were the names of six of the tribes; that is to say, he had the names of the saints on his heart and supported them on his shoulders, so that what answers to priesthood now is love to the saints, and what goes with it support of the saints.<a name=26:5></a>

		PAUL'S MINISTRY -- THE CHRISTIAN'S DISTINCTIVE LIGHT
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20:17">Acts  20:17</a> - 28
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My thought is to say a word about Paul and his ministry.<a name=45:1></a> It is of all importance that we should pay attention to Paul, for he presents to us in his ministry what may be regarded as our specific light.<a name=45:2></a> There is a certain light in which we, as partakers of the heavenly calling, are to shine, and that light is Paul's ministry.<a name=45:3></a> I have no doubt that in the ministry of the twelve, especially in Peter's address on the day of Pentecost, we have Israel's light.<a name=45:4></a> I do not deny that the chapter presents what is distinctively Christian, for it does, but Peter says, "the promise is unto you"; that is to say, to Israel, it was Israel's moment.<a name=45:5></a> The rejected Messiah was in heaven, and He was in heaven on their account.<a name=45:6></a> He gave the Spirit, and it was therefore a moment of marvellous light for them, a moment in which we may introduce chapter 60 of the prophet Isaiah; "Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee".<a name=45:7></a> It was a moment of marvellous light for Israel: Peter testified, that as in heaven, the Lord Jesus had "shed forth this which you now see and hear".<a name=45:8></a> It was the moment in which Israel might have shaken themselves from the dust and shone in their light.<a name=45:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I wish to point out that whilst this marvellous light is light for us, it is not our distinctive light.<a name=45:10></a> The light in which we are to shine is Paul's light, and if we do not shine in Paul's light, we shall not shine at all.<a name=45:11></a> I wish therefore to speak of Paul.<a name=45:12></a> As another has said, <i>Heavenly light makes all things bright</i>, and in the gaze of that light everything is seen in its true relation.<a name=45:13></a> Paul's light is to endure.<a name=45:14></a> In chapter 3 of the second letter to Timothy he calls attention to his doctrine and his manner of life, and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I read this passage because it embodies the two thoughts; it speaks of the manner of man he was, and the teaching he presented to the saints.<a name=46:1></a> The man who is to stand in the latter and difficult days is supposed to know these things, he is supposed to be acquainted with Paul's doctrine and with Paul's manner of life.<a name=46:2></a> It is possible to divorce the doctrine from the manner of life, but if the manner of life is not in accord with the doctrine, the doctrine must become a dead letter; they go together.<a name=46:3></a> If you have the doctrine and the manner of life in agreement, you have the luminous body upon earth.<a name=46:4></a> The person whose soul is in the light of Paul's doctrine, and whose life is in accord with it, is a luminous body, a heavenly body; he shines in his own light.<a name=46:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I wish to show you, if I can, how the Spirit of God in the Acts leads up to this point; that is to say, He leads up to a point where we find a company of men and women to whom Paul could disclose freely all the counsel of God.<a name=46:6></a> What a pleasure to Paul to be able to free to bring forward that which his heart cherished, and to speak freely and fully of every part of the divine counsels!<a name=46:7></a> My conception of those who shall throng the courts on high is, that they are intelligent; they answer to Abigail, the last type, as I understand it, of the assembly in the Old Testament; they are of a good understanding and of a beautiful countenance.<a name=46:8></a> Those courts shall be thronged with such people.<a name=46:9></a> On earth there shall be a people, but not their equal; they shall have God's laws in their hearts, they shall answer in that way to righteousness here, their hearts and minds shall be controlled by God's laws and their sins forgiven, but in the courts on high we shall see the assembly in its glory as formed by Paul's ministry.<a name=46:10></a> She will be marked by a good understanding, a full, intelligent apprehension of all the divine secrets, and a beautiful countenance.<a name=46:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=47>[Page 47]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish to show also, if I can, the order in which the Spirit of God leads us to that point.<a name=47:1></a> I take the liberty of going back to chapter 6 of the Acts, and here I would remind you that the Spirit of God inserts nothing in Scripture without a purpose, and He omits nothing without a purpose, and what He records in the end of chapter 6 is that a man appears whose countenance is as that of an angel's; he is a remarkable man.<a name=47:2></a> You will all remember that Stephen was one of those deputed by the apostles to serve tables.<a name=47:3></a> Beloved friends, if we ever regard the work that refers to the support of the saints as beneath us, those whom we depute to accomplish it shall shine in our stead.<a name=47:4></a> Stephen and Philip shone not only as table-servers, but as ministers of divine and spiritual things.<a name=47:5></a> See the face of Stephen!<a name=47:6></a> He shines with a heavenly countenance, in the presence of the council; that is the significance of an angel's face.<a name=47:7></a> That face did not reflect what was at Jerusalem, it reflected what was in heaven; he shines with a heavenly countenance and he died as a priest.<a name=47:8></a> He died praying for his murderers.<a name=47:9></a> What a marvellous testimony!<a name=47:10></a> It appears at the juncture of the severance of God's relations with His earthly people, like the death of Samuel.<a name=47:11></a> You will all remember that Samuel died as Abigail appeared.<a name=47:12></a> The link between God and the people was severed, and at that juncture a heavenly countenance appeared; that is to say, what was earthly is superseded by what is heavenly, and the man who shone in the end of chapter 6 with a heavenly countenance, at the end of chapter 7 dies as a priest.<a name=47:13></a> Such is God's testimony at the juncture when He severed His relation with His earthly people.<a name=47:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, I want to show you the order in which the truth is developed.<a name=47:15></a> You will all remember that Saul was present at the death of Stephen; he saw that countenance, he heard Stephen's testimony;
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=48>[Page 48]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and what was it?<a name=48:1></a> There was a <i>Man in heaven</i>.<a name=48:2></a> Peter testified that the One whom they rejected, the same Jesus, the same Man, was anointed in heaven.<a name=48:3></a> Of Stephen it is said that "he saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God".<a name=48:4></a> The Man who was accepted there had secured the glory.<a name=48:5></a> What a triumph!<a name=48:6></a> Well, Saul heard that, and he saw the priest; he saw a man kneeling and praying for his adversaries, a perfect reflection of the great High Priest who prayed for them at the cross.<a name=48:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What a testimony to Saul!<a name=48:8></a> Well now, in the next chapter the spirit of evangelisation appears.<a name=48:9></a> The Lord had bought the field, and He had title to it, the treasure was in it, and <i>that</i> He would have, and hence the activity of Philip the evangelist.<a name=48:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in the passage from Isaiah read by the eunuch you have the Man whose "life is taken from the earth"; that is an important element in the development of the testimony.<a name=48:11></a> "His life is taken from the earth", but Stephen saw Him in heaven, and the Ethiopian read about Him.<a name=48:12></a> Who shall declare His generation?<a name=48:13></a> For He was "cut off out of the land of the living".<a name=48:14></a> He is a heavenly Man.<a name=48:15></a> He belongs to heaven, His life is taken from the earth.<a name=48:16></a> It reminds one of Isaac walking in the fields.<a name=48:17></a> You all remember that Isaac is typically the heavenly man.<a name=48:18></a> Directly we have the testimony of his resurrection; that is to say, in type the resurrection of Christ, you have the genealogy of Rebecca.<a name=48:19></a> Isaac is claimed from heaven, remember that.<a name=48:20></a> The angel called to Abraham out of heaven; <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#22:11">Genesis  22:11</a>.<a name=48:21></a> Isaac as typifying Christ belonged to heaven, and he must have a companion, and his companion is to be equal to him, she is of the same genealogy.<a name=48:22></a> "Who shall declare his generation?<a name=48:23></a> for his life is taken from the earth".<a name=48:24></a> Such is the testimony brought to the heart of the Ethiopian eunuch.<a name=48:25></a> How Philip would enlarge upon that!<a name=48:26></a> We are told that he began there.<a name=48:27></a> There is

		no life on earth now, no earthly associations now in which you can find life.<a name=49:1></a> Jesus' life is taken from the earth.<a name=49:2></a> What a start for an Ethiopian eunuch, and how admirably he started!<a name=49:3></a> He started rejoicing, he accepted the rejection of that Man, he went down into the waters and was baptised.<a name=49:4></a> In the next chapter the Man whose life was taken from the earth is speaking from heaven.<a name=49:5></a> In chapter 7 He is <i>standing</i> in heaven, and in chapter 9 is <i>speaking from</i> heaven.<a name=49:6></a> Let us pay attention to that.<a name=49:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First of all the light shines out of heaven, and then the voice is out of heaven, all a direct intimation of the change of base of God's operations.<a name=49:8></a> Jerusalem is displaced by heaven, and then the voice is out of heaven.<a name=49:9></a> That voice secures the vessel, for round about Paul there shone a light from heaven, his environment was illuminated from heaven and his heart was touched by a voice from heaven.<a name=49:10></a> Saul became a vessel of heavenly light.<a name=49:11></a> You will all remember how Paul gives an account of the incident; indeed he gives two accounts of it.<a name=49:12></a> Luke gives one, and his is simply that it was "a light from heaven".<a name=49:13></a> Paul's first account is that it was a "great light" out of heaven, and his second is that it was "a light from heaven above the brightness of the sun".<a name=49:14></a> These things are recorded thus doubtless as reminding us of the character of his ministry; it was heavenly.<a name=49:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, the Lord has His vessel.<a name=49:16></a> He is the vessel through whom the great treasure is to be brought to light and formed.<a name=49:17></a> The field was wide, the treasure was in it, but it was bought in all its extent.<a name=49:18></a> I am referring to <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13">Matthew  13</a>.<a name=49:19></a> The Lord, on the ground of redemption, has secured right-of-way among mankind in order that He should have the treasure.<a name=49:20></a> He can seek for it where He pleases and who dares to dispute His right?<a name=49:21></a> And hence in chapter 10 the door is opened out into the wide field; Peter opens the door and Paul goes out by the door

		Peter did not.<a name=50:1></a> You will all remember the introduction of the assembly in the gospel of Matthew; Peter got the light of it, but not the ministry of it.<a name=50:2></a> He was simply commissioned with the keys of the kingdom of heaven; he got the keys, we may say, to let Paul out.<a name=50:3></a> I am speaking now from one point of view, there are others.<a name=50:4></a> The Lord had the vessel, Paul, and he was to search the field; he had a message that extended to the whole field, and Peter opened the door.<a name=50:5></a> It will be found to be a principle in the Acts, that in every locality where the work of God progresses, some special feature of the testimony comes to light.<a name=50:6></a> At Caesarea the door was opened; the Gentiles came in and Paul went out.<a name=50:7></a> I am speaking now as you understand in the most general way.<a name=50:8></a> "Unto thee", says the Lord to Peter, "I will give the keys of the kingdom of heaven".<a name=50:9></a> Directly the assembly is introduced, the keys of the kingdom are introduced in order to make room for it, and to make room for the vessel by whom it shall be brought in.<a name=50:10></a>

		When you come to <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#11">Acts  11</a>, you find Barnabas, he appears earlier as a consolation to the apostles, "son of consolation", but here he is sympathetic with what God is doing, a great element in the development of the testimony,; and following upon that he was at Antioch.<a name=50:11></a> At the end of chapter 11 you will find what is priestly.<a name=50:12></a> There was need among +he saints and those at Antioch were equal to it.<a name=50:13></a> They lent the shoulder, they gave as each man had ability for the support of the saints; that was manward, that was royal.<a name=50:14></a> In the beginning of chapter 13 you have the same people in principle ministering Godward.<a name=50:15></a> The priesthood was now amongst the Gentiles; they ministered to the Lord and to the saints.<a name=50:16></a> That is the testimony that appears at Antioch.<a name=50:17></a> The priesthood is there, and depend upon it, without the priesthood you have nothing; with it you have everything.<a name=50:18></a> In the beginning of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I pass on now to <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#18">Acts  18</a>in order to show how Paul's ministry progressed, and I would say in brief that while Corinth presents to us the wilderness side of it, Ephesus, in chapter 19, presents to us the results of his ministry in the heavenly side of it.<a name=51:3></a> I wonder if you follow what I mean by that.<a name=51:4></a> We have to take account of our position in this world as a company of people that have had their part in the world; we ran riot with the Gentiles, we followed the bent of our own wills, and in doing so we have dishonoured God; but we have been converted; that is the position at Corinth.<a name=51:5></a> The Lord says to Paul at Corinth: "Be not afraid .<a name=51:6></a>.<a name=51:7></a>.<a name=51:8></a> I have much people in this city".<a name=51:9></a> The Lord shall have a people in heaven, but He has <i>people in a city</i>.<a name=51:10></a> You can well understand that it is one thing to see a company of God's people divinely taken account of in a city on earth, and another to see the same people taken account of in heaven.<a name=51:11></a> Now Corinth is the one and Ephesus is the other.<a name=51:12></a> There is a company of people in a city belonging to the Lord, and His name is bound up with them.<a name=51:13></a> God has been pleased to convert them, to own them, to call them out of the world and to give them a name, the assembly of God <i>at Corinth</i>.<a name=51:14></a> They are God's assembly there.<a name=51:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now you can readily perceive how many thoughts enter into that, they have come out of Egypt and they are in the wilderness.<a name=51:16></a> I need not remind you that Corinth is the wilderness; it was adverse for the saints of God in every possible way, and yet they were in it, taken account of, and called God's assembly in it.<a name=51:17></a> God's honour is bound up with that people, His order is to be seen there, His government is to be seen there, and every member of that company is

		to recognise that it is God's assembly, not man's and in that assembly there is everything requisite for its support, maintenance and order.<a name=52:1></a> It was God's building, God's temple, and it was Christ's body in that city.<a name=52:2></a> Now all that was brought to pass through Paul's ministry.<a name=52:3></a> The Lord stood by him until the saints at Corinth were delivered, and then he writes his letter to them, which is left on record, and shows how the assembly is to be governed during all the period of the absence of the Lord.<a name=52:4></a> When you come to Ephesus, you have the saints not viewed in the wilderness or according to what is manward, which is Corinth, but according to what it is Christward and Godward; in other words, in Ephesus we reach the treasure, and I might add we reach the pearl.<a name=52:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I have come to the point that I desire to leave with us and to enlarge on for a moment.<a name=52:6></a> One has great exercise that the saints, as I have been saying, might shine in their own light.<a name=52:7></a> See how earnestly and ceaselessly Paul laboured, in order that the Ephesian saints might shine in their own light.<a name=52:8></a> Now he was departing and he sends for the elders.<a name=52:9></a> The elders were those who were specially entrusted with the responsibility of the flock.<a name=52:10></a> He says, Feed the flock of God "which he has purchased with the blood of his own".<a name=52:11></a> It is the strongest kind of expression, showing what Christ is to God.<a name=52:12></a> It is not simply the beloved, or the beloved Son, it is a stronger term as expressing affection; it is God's Own, as though there were not another.<a name=52:13></a> In that light the flock is regarded; they are those who are purchased with the blood of One so loved.<a name=52:14></a>

		My thought is to seek to show the connection between Jerusalem and the priesthood.<a name=55:1></a> Of old you will remember it was indicated in the typical books that the system introduced by Moses was made to depend for its continuance upon the priest; that is to say, the order of God in the created universe is made to depend upon the priest.<a name=55:2></a> You will remember the principle enunciated in chapter 1 of the epistle to the Hebrews that God made everything by the Son; everything was called into being and set in its order by the Son.<a name=55:3></a> Then following upon that we have the principle that He upholds what He created.<a name=55:4></a> Wonderful thought!<a name=55:5></a> As we look abroad on the vast expanse of the heavens and take account of the earth and its surrounding planets, let us remember that all that is upheld by the Son, "upholding all things by the word of his power".<a name=55:6></a>

		In turning to Zechariah one feels particularly encouraged because his ministry had to do with the returned remnant; not with Jerusalem in its pristine days under David and Solomon, but with Jerusalem as rebuilt by the returned captives of Babylon.<a name=56:11></a> You will all remember that in association with Haggai, Zechariah stirred up Joshua and Zerubbabel, and the others who laboured at the city and the temple.<a name=56:12></a> He was a prophet raised up to stir up the energies of the people, therefore you can rightly draw a parallel with our own times.<a name=56:13></a> There was no king raised up after the captivity; kings came in, I admit, but not divinely appointed; but there was a priest.<a name=56:14></a> My object in referring to it in this way, is to point out that what we require, beloved brethren, is the priest.<a name=56:15></a> I quite admit that we must submit to the authority of the Lord, that is of all moment.<a name=56:16></a> I

		Now I turn to <a href="../bible/Zechariah.htm#6">Zechariah  6</a>.<a name=59:6></a> You will see there that there are two distinct classes of agencies used in the government of God; there are four chariots issuing from between two mountains of brass and drawn by certain coloured horses.<a name=59:7></a> It is well to remember how extensive God's rule is and how varied the instruments of it are.<a name=59:8></a> There are two mountains of brass.<a name=59:9></a> I do not suppose that there is a right minded Christian here, or anywhere, who is not affected by the conditions which prevail in the world.<a name=59:10></a> We cannot be with God without feeling them.<a name=59:11></a> We, forget too much the divine sensibilities as to what prevails in the world; the world is lawless in every possible way.<a name=59:12></a> Well now, in this chapter, we have what may be called the <i>indirect</i> instruments of His government and the <i>direct</i> instruments of His government.<a name=59:13></a> We should pray for both.<a name=59:14></a> One knows it in one's self and one notices it in others, how little we enter into the divine mind as to the conditions in the world, and yet we are enjoined to pray for the powers that be.<a name=59:15></a> They are the indirect instruments of the divine government upon earth, and we should be thankful for them.<a name=59:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We read that the chariots issue forth from between two mountains of brass, and I have not a doubt that they allude to the four great empires that God was pleased to use for maintaining the order of the world; but what I would point out is this, that whilst they mitigate to a certain degree the lawlessness in the world, yet their energy is that of <i>horses</i>.<a name=59:17></a> If they were simply beasts, they would not be under divine control.<a name=59:18></a> In themselves that is what the

		empires were, wild beasts, utterly conscienceless but a horse is within control.<a name=60:1></a> In His indirect govern went God saw to it that these powers were under control and useful, but they are not God's people God's people are not horses, they are all priests, and priests are not held in by bit and bridle, they are governed through the mind and heart.<a name=60:2></a> The Lord set forth the idea here upon earth and taught it to His disciples.<a name=60:3></a> Priests are controlled through their affections, and their influence is through the affections.<a name=60:4></a> Horses are not regarded as having affection or sensibilities at all that are in accord with God; they are controlled by external influence.<a name=60:5></a> In the Psalms we are exhorted not to be like them; alas we are often like them.<a name=60:6></a> If our wills are at work, we become as horses, having to be held in by the bit and bridle.<a name=60:7></a> The Psalmist, having been in the sanctuary, says, "I was as a beast before thee".<a name=60:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In these four chariots and horses we have what we may call the providential instruments of God's government, and alongside these we have the priest, and that is what I desire, dear brethren, might be clearly before our minds.<a name=60:9></a> There are crowns made of gold and of silver, and the crowns were placed upon Joshua, the son of Josedech, the high priest; that was for a testimony.<a name=60:10></a> God was calling attention to the great contrast between the empires that He used in His government upon the earth, and His precious Son as King and Priest, for Joshua was a type of Christ.<a name=60:11></a> That is the testimony of the book of Zechariah.<a name=60:12></a> Luke specially presents to us that blessed Man; he traces His history back to Adam, but the truth that He is a divine Person is ever asserted.<a name=60:13></a> As born unto this world it is said "that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God".<a name=60:14></a> His uniqueness is carefully guarded at the outset, but He is a Man, hence He is taken from among men to be a Priest.<a name=60:15></a>

		The scripture goes on to say, "he shall grow up out of his place, and shall build the temple of the Lord: even he shall build the temple of the Lord; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne; and the counsel of peace shall be between them both".<a name=61:11></a> That is Christ.<a name=61:12></a> What a contrast you have there to the great rulers of the world!<a name=61:13></a> There was the entire absence of the divine glory in their rule, but in Christ you have it; He bears the glory.<a name=61:14></a> I want to point out that He shall be a Priest upon His throne; and that the counsel of peace shall be between them both.<a name=61:15></a> That is to say, rule and priesthood are united in the counsel of peace, and that is what we need, dear brethren, the counsel of peace.<a name=61:16></a> There is no surrender of principle; we never should admit the principle of agreement to differ, which is

		<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:1">Acts  9:1</a> - 19
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have in mind to dwell on two transactions in this chapter; one with the Lord Jesus directly, and the other with the brethren, the saints of God.<a name=63:1></a> This chapter is much used in the proclamation of the glad tidings, and I am using it now because it presents these two themes; a transaction between the Lord Jesus and a great sinner; and then a transaction between the saints, or one of them, and that same man.<a name=63:2></a> The second transaction is of as much importance as the first if the work of God is to be <i>completed</i> in us.<a name=63:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first transaction is with the Lord, announcing Himself as Jesus: "I am Jesus".<a name=63:4></a> Luke particularly emphasises that name as appearing in the earlier part of this book, for he would dissipate in the minds of men and woman all prejudice that is apt to be there against God, for generally He is not known.<a name=63:5></a> He is apprehended in people's minds in a distorted way as if He were hard and exacting, whereas Luke would disabuse our minds of all such thoughts.<a name=63:6></a> He would emphasise Jesus as representing God here, and that name should not strike terror into anybody's heart; it is calculated to appeal even to a child -- "the name of Jesus".<a name=63:7></a> Hence we find in this book that the writer commences by referring to "all things that Jesus began both to do and to teach".<a name=63:8></a> In approaching man, the <i>doing</i> comes first; it is not exacting but helping and blessing man.<a name=63:9></a> Elsewhere we are told that He "went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with Him",
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10:38">Acts  10:38</a>. The <i>doing</i> is placed first, and then the teaching, for teaching in itself will not represent God, we need the teaching exemplified.<a name=63:10></a>

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=64>[Page 64]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Luke is referring to what he had written already to this believer called Theophilus, so we are directed back to his gospel for examples of the doings of Jesus, and of the teachings of Jesus.<a name=64:1></a> The aim is to clear the mind of any hard thoughts and misconceptions of God, for He was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not imputing their trespasses.<a name=64:2></a> In the well-known incident recorded in Luke of two persons, one of whom owed much to a certain creditor and one little, we are told that when they had nothing to pay, "he frankly forgave them both".<a name=64:3></a> It was to convey the gracious attitude of God to sinners, and that is what the gospel by Luke emphasises.<a name=64:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>Luke speaks of Jesus going up into heaven, those who loved Him having beheld Him going up.<a name=64:5></a> Most of us here tonight love Jesus, and love, too, the thought of His going up.<a name=64:6></a> Luke ends his gospel by telling us that Jesus was "carried up into heaven"; heaven honoured Him by carrying Him up.<a name=64:7></a> Those who loved Him beheld Him, and then the angels tell them that the same Jesus whom they saw going into heaven should in like manner come back again.<a name=64:8></a> That is what we think about; but if you are not a believer in Christ you do not think of that.<a name=64:9></a> We who love Jesus think of Him as having gone up, and as coming back; and in the meantime we are seeking to make Him known here, to announce Him as glad tidings.<a name=64:10></a> How sweet and full the name Jesus is!<a name=64:11></a> It signifies "Jehovah the Saviour", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#1:21">Matthew  1:21</a>.<a name=64:12></a>

		J.T.<a name=87:5></a> Well, in the book of Deuteronomy the priesthood is scarcely distinguished from the Levites.<a name=87:6></a> I think that the way the Levite is alluded to in Deuteronomy is to show that the people are in direct touch with God without an intermediary; in fact, they are called the sons of God.<a name=87:7></a> Viewed in that light, we do not need an intermediary.<a name=87:8></a>

		J.T.<a name=87:15></a> Yes, here.<a name=87:16></a> We shall see in chapter 3, that we have the service of the Levites detailed; so that in that sense the Levite refers to the Christian now, in contrast to what he may be in other connections; but where it is distinctly said that they are not to be numbered amongst others, there they are signalised.<a name=87:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=113:1></a> I thought that perhaps we might see how the believer enters into the wilderness; and I think this chapter enables us to see that.<a name=113:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		T.M.<a name=113:3></a>G.<a name=113:4></a> What is the idea connected with the wilderness?<a name=113:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=113:6></a> Well, in a general way there are three leading features of it.<a name=113:7></a> The wilderness is the place of testing, as we all know; but it may be divided into three sections; the first is that which appears in the book of Exodus, where they are under pure grace; that is, from chapter 15 to chapter 18 inclusive, they were under the rule of pure grace.<a name=113:8></a> The next section views the believer in relationship with the tabernacle, where God's rule and God's order are seen.<a name=113:9></a> Then there is the section which views the believer in relation with the Spirit, which comes in after <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21">Numbers  21</a>.<a name=113:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		T.M.<a name=113:11></a>G.<a name=113:12></a> After the brazen serpent.<a name=113:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=113:14></a> I thought it would be helpful if we were to consider a little what the wilderness involves in that way, especially for young people; that it might be understood that God takes us up as believing in Christ, and as committing ourselves to Him in baptism.<a name=113:15></a> God takes us up and deals with us at the outset on the principle of pure grace.<a name=113:16></a> Whatever we may do He has no answer for us but grace; so that the murmurings up to chapter 18 are answered by grace; there is no judgment as <i>yet</i>.<a name=113:17></a> This chapter in the light of the anti-type really suggests that the believer loves God; and the song is a celebration of what God has done for them.<a name=113:18></a> They speak specially of His "right hand".<a name=113:19></a> We read in the book of Proverbs "A man's heart is at his right hand".<a name=113:20></a> God acted for them in love.<a name=113:21></a> His right hand is at the

		<a name=114>[Page 114]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		disposal of His heart, and they recognise that in their song.<a name=114:1></a> So that it is clear that at the outset of the believer's career, there is love.<a name=114:2></a> God takes account of it in their song, however little of it may be discernible.<a name=114:3></a> God speaks of it in that way.<a name=114:4></a> He tells us what we were in the wilderness.<a name=114:5></a> Israel was "holiness to the Lord, the first fruit of his increase".<a name=114:6></a> God takes account of that, and He would foster it; He would promote that in us.<a name=114:7></a> Hence what follows is the palm trees, the sweetening of the waters, and all that is to promote affection for God.<a name=114:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=114:11></a> Yes.<a name=114:12></a> I think there is the recognition in the soul of what God has done for us in Christ.<a name=114:13></a> So that in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>we read: "as many of you as were baptised unto Christ"; that is, you have regard for Him, hence you are baptised to Him; but the passage goes on to say, "as many of you as were baptised unto Christ were baptised unto his death".<a name=114:14></a> That marks you off here.<a name=114:15></a>

		J.T.<a name=114:19></a> I think so.<a name=114:20></a> <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>corresponds with that; but it is to be noted, that "as many of you as were baptised unto Christ"; it is to the Person, and that supposes that you have regard for the Person.<a name=114:21></a> You love Him, and you have committed yourself to Him; but the death side comes to light in the wilderness.<a name=114:22></a>

		You will understand from these passages that my thought is to say a word about Light; and I wish specially to enlarge upon what may be regarded as <i>our</i> light.<a name=149:1></a> The passage in Isaiah speaks of a special light.<a name=149:2></a> The chapter is addressed, as you will readily perceive, to Israel; and she is called upon to "Arise, shine, for thy light is come" -- <i>her light</i>.<a name=149:3></a> That is to say, there was a special light which has reference to that nation.<a name=149:4></a> You will remember how Simeon took the little Child into his arms in the temple, as recorded by Luke, and he refers to the Lord in this way "A light for the revelation of the Gentiles".<a name=149:5></a> There he alludes to the Gentile's light.<a name=149:6></a> Christ would be a light to the Gentiles; whereas, Isaiah refers to Him as Israel's light.<a name=149:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I want to make clear that there is a special light for us.<a name=149:8></a> Light is referred to in Scripture perhaps as extensively as any other subject.<a name=149:9></a> It is primarily referred to as a necessity.<a name=149:10></a> You will find, I think, as a principle, that whatever God commands is an absolute necessity.<a name=149:11></a> He is said to have commanded <i>light</i>; He is said to have commanded <i>life</i>; and He is said to have commanded <i>repentance</i>.<a name=149:12></a> These things are necessities on account of conditions here.<a name=149:13></a> The necessity for the command that there should be light was obvious, because darkness prevailed.<a name=149:14></a> Darkness, we are told, was on the face of the deep; hence God commanded what was a necessity; He commanded light, and there was light.<a name=149:15></a> On the first day in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>, light is commanded, without saying whence it came, or what was its origin.<a name=149:16></a> We have the simple fact stated that God commanded light, and that there was light.<a name=149:17></a>

		Now, that is the point that I desire to lead to; that the Light is in heaven now.<a name=150:8></a> First of all, Christ had to become Light upon earth.<a name=150:9></a> "The true light was that which, coming into the world, lightens every man"; it does not say here coming from heaven.<a name=150:10></a> That is John's presentation of it.<a name=150:11></a> A divine Person in the world is Light, and He sheds His light on every man.<a name=150:12></a> <i>Man</i> was in view.<a name=150:13></a> Man was in total darkness; and Christ coming into the world is light.<a name=150:14></a>

		Well, now, you can see in these three passages in the Acts, how the Spirit lays emphasis on the thought of light in heaven; it comes out of that sphere; and it is a principle that those who are illuminated by any given light, make their way to the source of it; hence if you are illuminated by any light out of heaven, the answer to it is that you seek heaven.<a name=154:9></a> The light from heaven gives character to Paul's ministry; it was to be a heavenly ministry.<a name=154:10></a> The apostle Paul never gives up this line until he sets the assembly in heaven.<a name=154:11></a> That is the great end of his ministry.<a name=154:12></a> You will recall that in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#22">Genesis  22</a>, when the resurrection of Christ is foreshadowed in Isaac, the Spirit of God immediately proceeds to give us the genealogy of Rebekah; in chapter 23 Sarah dies, and is buried; and in chapter 24 Rebekah is brought to Isaac.<a name=154:13></a>

		Now, I read in Ephesians because that epistle presents this light to us.<a name=155:13></a> It is the suited presentation of the light to the assembly; perhaps the epistle least understood by us.<a name=155:14></a> Many prefer Israel's light to our light; and therefore I appeal to you.<a name=155:15></a> Look at how the apostle addresses these Gentile believers in Christ; he says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings (now note, <i>where</i>) in heavenly places in Christ".<a name=155:16></a> The point is, not exactly the blessings, but, <i>where</i> they are.<a name=155:17></a> Where are they?<a name=155:18></a> In the heavenlies.<a name=155:19></a> We are not blessed on earth; Israel shall be blessed from heaven upon, earth.<a name=155:20></a> You will remember in <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#9">Leviticus  9</a>, that Moses and Aaron "came out", and they blessed the congregation.<a name=155:21></a> That is future.<a name=155:22></a> <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#8">Leviticus  8</a>is our chapter; we come in there; and so in Ephesians.<a name=155:23></a> Israel will be blessed on earth.<a name=155:24></a> We are blessed with <i>every</i> spiritual blessing,

		The Philippian epistle is the reflection of this in us; so that the apostle presses upon them that they are to be lights in the world.<a name=156:4></a> What kind of lights?<a name=156:5></a> Heavenly luminaries.<a name=156:6></a> As I said before, we belong to the fourth day.<a name=156:7></a> The fourth day speaks of lights in the heavens.<a name=156:8></a> "God said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven, to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and for years; and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven, to give light upon the earth; and God made two great lights;" and then you have the stars.<a name=156:9></a> The Philippian epistle, I believe, presents the stars to us, the heavenly luminaries.<a name=156:10></a> We shine as lights in the world; we are children of God; and we shine; and so the apostle enlarges upon it.<a name=156:11></a> Our citizenship is in heaven; our blessings are there, and our treasures are there; our names are registered there.<a name=156:12></a>

		that he may serve me: and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy firstborn".<a name=161:1></a> What do you see in that?<a name=161:2></a> It is God announcing His eternal thought in regard of man, and He appeals to a well-known affection which had a place in the heart of Pharaoh, an affection which God had placed there Himself; for natural affection is of God.<a name=161:3></a> He says in effect to Pharaoh, 'You have a son, and you have affection for your son; I have the affections of a father.<a name=161:4></a> Israel is My son, My firstborn, and if you do not let him go I will deprive you of your son'.<a name=161:5></a>

		He had an avenue into Pharaoh's heart by the affections which He had placed there as Pharaoh's Creator, and yet Pharaoh hardened his heart and refused to let the light shine into it.<a name=161:6></a> And the result was that God deprived Pharaoh of his son; and more than that, in depriving Pharaoh of his son, God secured His own son.<a name=161:7></a> He delivered Israel out of Egypt and led them into the wilderness.<a name=161:8></a> As He says, "I have borne you upon eagle's wings".<a name=161:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, beloved friends, what I wish to point out in connection with that is that the character of the stubborn son appeared in Israel.<a name=162:14></a> Israel was really the "stubborn son", and this is in keeping with the book of Deuteronomy, which deals with the relationship formed between God and His people.<a name=162:15></a> The priesthood and the tabernacle are not prominent in this book; it is a question of relationship formed between God and His people; and in the passage I read God shows how He regards the rebellion of Israel in the wilderness and onward.<a name=162:16></a> They were rebellious at every point, and wholly unsympathetic with what God was doing.<a name=162:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I pass on to show you how that same spirit of rebellion and utter want of sympathy was found in connection with the proclamation of the glad tidings.<a name=162:18></a> We have it in this wonderful chapter, <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15">Luke  15</a>.<a name=162:19></a> That chapter is not, however, so great as

		chapter 14, which presents the "great supper", representing God's delight in Christ as having accomplished righteousness.<a name=163:1></a> God invites all to that.<a name=163:2></a> Chapter 15 has reference to God's delight in the returning prodigal; and the close of it shows us that that which delighted God was wholly without interest except in the way of opposition; to those who had the part and place of the "elder brother".<a name=163:3></a> The elder brother represents the man after the flesh in the place of privilege, and represents Israel as having the first place with God.<a name=163:4></a> There is no reproof in the father's words to the elder brother here: the next chapter suffices for that.<a name=163:5></a> It would not be suitable for the father to judge the elder brother; it was all pure grace.<a name=163:6></a> But see the hardening of heart expressed in the elder brother.<a name=163:7></a> The father comes out to him and says, "this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found".<a name=163:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He appealed to his heart.<a name=163:9></a> This should have touched him, but as of old in Pharaoh's case, he was proof against the divine appeal; that of a father; he disregarded the divine appeal to him as a brother; he had no brotherly affection.<a name=163:10></a> Pharaoh had no true fatherly affection; if he had he would have had respect for God's fatherly affection.<a name=163:11></a> The elder brother had no true brotherly affection; the Jew manifested utter want of it.<a name=163:12></a>

		Now when you come to the historical order in Acts you will find the stubborn son expressed in Saul of Tarsus.<a name=163:13></a> He was the embodiment of all that was antagonistic to Christ, and to the disciples of Christ; and that in the presence of Stephen, who was the most wonderful expression of the Spirit of Christ.<a name=163:14></a> What made Saul doubly responsible was that in the testimony of Stephen there was the most perfect expression of the Spirit of Christ.<a name=163:15></a> Saul was one of those who held the clothes of those who stoned the martyr.<a name=163:16></a> The Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of the

		GRACE AND GLORY

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#9:18">Luke  9:18</a> - 22, 27 - 35
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My wish at this time is to speak about <i>grace</i>, and to connect with it the thought of glory.<a name=207:1></a> These thoughts are intimately connected in Scripture, and inasmuch as we are said to appear in the future to the praise of the glory of God's grace, it is important we should be acquainted with grace.<a name=207:2></a> It is perhaps the most elementary thought in connection with our salvation but the least understood; the full bearing and result of it is its glory.<a name=207:3></a> You will find that comments in the New Testament on Old Testament events or persons always throw a flood of light on the events or persons to which they allude.<a name=207:4></a> So you get the idea of glory attached to certain Old Testament events.<a name=207:5></a> I refer to one specially as supporting what I say, God's call to Abraham.<a name=207:6></a> Stephen, in the power of the Spirit, refers to it.<a name=207:7></a> He begins his address by alluding to the "God of glory".<a name=207:8></a> The God of glory beginning to operate had His glory in view, but in order that the glory should be reached there must be a vessel through whom it was to be reached, and in reaching it <i>grace</i> has to be resorted to.<a name=207:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So you find in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9">Hebrews  9</a>the "cherubim of glory".<a name=207:10></a> The Spirit of God, who knew what was involved in the cherubim, alludes to them according to His knowledge and calls them the cherubim of glory, which overshadowed the mercy-seat.<a name=207:11></a> What lay under the mercy-seat referred to Christ, to Christ become Man here with the will of God in His heart.<a name=207:12></a> He said, "Lo, I come to do thy will;" it was His pleasure.<a name=207:13></a> He <i>descended</i>, becoming Man in order to effectuate that glory.<a name=207:14></a> So Stephen's address leads to that point, he saw the glory of God.<a name=207:15></a> <i>Where</i> did he see it?<a name=207:16></a> With Jesus in heaven, beyond the reach of the attack of man.<a name=207:17></a> What I have to say lies between these points.<a name=207:18></a> That blessed Man had been on earth,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the cherubim were not required in heaven, they were required when Jesus was on earth, their outstretched wings overshadowed Christ, hence the glory.<a name=208:1></a> Every look of God on that Man had behind it His divine affections for Him.<a name=208:2></a> Every direction from heaven with regard to the Babe, the Boy, the Man, had the love of the Father behind it; there, behind the veil, were the cherubim of glory shadowing the mercy-seat.<a name=208:3></a> The mercy-seat and all beneath it suggested the blessed Man in whom the grace shone forth on earth, so we can understand the expression the "cherubim of glory".<a name=208:4></a> The divine interest in that Man is testified to by the cherubim of glory.<a name=208:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In coming to Luke we are prepared for this; he is the one writer who undertakes to write with method.<a name=208:6></a> Every inspired writer had a divine end in view, each spoke according to what he saw.<a name=208:7></a> Luke, by the Spirit, had a wonderful vision of Christ; he writes for us a full outline of His sayings and doings; the circumstances of His life are set forth, His boyhood, His manhood, all to enhance for us His grace.<a name=208:8></a> Israel had said at Sinai, 'Let us not hear again that voice'.<a name=208:9></a> They trembled, they said to Moses, "Speak thou with us .<a name=208:10></a>.<a name=208:11></a>.<a name=208:12></a> but let not God speak with us".<a name=208:13></a>

		<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#20:19">Exodus  20:19</a>. God says in Christ, 'I will take you at your word, the voice, though divine, is to a <i>man's</i> voice'.<a name=208:14></a> Elihu said to Job, "I am according to thy wish in God's stead;" <a href="../bible/Job.htm#33:6">Job  33:6</a>.<a name=208:15></a> How considerate God is!<a name=208:16></a> Elihu says; I am a man as you are, "My terror shall not make thee afraid", <a href="../bible/Job.htm#33:7">Job  33:7</a>.<a name=208:17></a> That is Luke's gospel, it is God drawing near in a Man, whose infancy is described, whose mother is introduced, and all that pertains to His boyhood and manhood, and the Spirit gives us His genealogy right back to Adam, and actually says Adam is of God; thus the race is accredited in every possible way.<a name=208:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Is there anything to fear in that Man?<a name=208:19></a> Jesus could say, "My terror shall not make thee afraid".<a name=208:20></a> Yet

	<div class="paragraph">
		He was truly divine, for Luke is careful of this, "that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God".<a name=209:1></a> The Lord Jesus is carefully identified as regards His supposed parents, He was perfectly Man and His genealogy is traced right back to Adam, and Adam connected with God.<a name=209:2></a> God is impressing on us that He would disarm us of every possible fear, so that Jesus goes back to where He was brought up, and there He stands up and reads, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor".<a name=209:3></a> There is grace in every movement, nothing to repel, nothing to deter man.<a name=209:4></a> "Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15:1">Luke  15:1</a>.<a name=209:5></a> The atmosphere around Jesus was full of liberty and sympathy, there was attraction in it, they drew near to him.<a name=209:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a remarkable example of this grace in chapter 7.<a name=209:7></a> The Lord is invited to dine with a Pharisee.<a name=209:8></a> It was in circumstances that would have forbidden any one to draw near, and yet there was one who had such a sense of the grace that was there, that she drew near; we often call her a sinner, but she was a saint!<a name=209:9></a> She drew near to Christ, she anointed His feet, she touched Him with the touch of love; no other can be a priestly touch but the touch of love.<a name=209:10></a> She did the service, and the secret of it was that she had learnt grace; she had been forgiven <i>much</i>.<a name=209:11></a> That was grace, and she in result loved much, so she does the service, under reproach in the world, under a stigma.<a name=209:12></a> Those in official position neglect Christ.<a name=209:13></a> He is neglected.<a name=209:14></a> Now while attending to Christ you are not to think of people's opinions.<a name=209:15></a> We need no official position in <i>attending to Christ</i>.<a name=209:16></a> If you have learnt grace, nothing in the way of privilege is equal in the present time to <i>attending to Christ</i>.<a name=209:17></a> Simon spoke within himself, "This man, if he were a prophet, would have known".<a name=209:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord did know.<a name=210:1></a> He knows all that is in the heart.<a name=210:2></a> He judged accurately about the woman; the greatest sinner that has been forgiven is the greatest lover of Christ.<a name=210:3></a> If you love Christ you will attend to Christ, and He notices and will justify you.<a name=210:4></a> See the dignity with which He justifies this woman.<a name=210:5></a> He used words with intent, with meaning, saying "she loved much", and when He said much He meant much.<a name=210:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#3">Luke  3</a>, directly the Lord was baptised, we see what He is in relation to God.<a name=210:7></a> What comes to light is what He is in regard to God.<a name=210:8></a> It says of Him, that "the heaven was opened .<a name=210:9></a>.<a name=210:10></a>.<a name=210:11></a> and a voice came from heaven".<a name=210:12></a> The Father would indicate what the relations were to Himself, saying, "Thou art my beloved Son".<a name=210:13></a> Then you have what He was in regard to Satan, and finally what He was in regard to man.<a name=210:14></a> I am speaking of these things that you might have an apprehension of Christ.<a name=210:15></a> The first point, and most important, is the Father's estimate of that Man.<a name=210:16></a> Luke tells us, <i>He was praying</i>.<a name=210:17></a> In that connection I would remark the Lord has great pleasure in a praying person, it is not only that you gain by it, but you are after the pattern of Christ in it.<a name=210:18></a> Saul was a man of whom the saints had good reason to be afraid.<a name=210:19></a> I am very afraid of men who are in opposition to Christ, men who are brought up in priestcraft, or steeped in lawlessness.<a name=210:20></a> I have great fear of such.<a name=210:21></a> The Lord knew what the saints would feel as to Saul, and He actually introduced him to the saints.<a name=210:22></a> It was a serious matter to introduce a person to the circle of fellowship.<a name=210:23></a> Now the Lord did it, in Saul's case; it shows His care for the brethren, and He did it with this commendation "Behold, he prayeth".<a name=210:24></a> That is, he is after the pattern of Christ.<a name=210:25></a>

		<a name=211>[Page 211]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		nothing to fear from a praying man.<a name=211:1></a> Samuel was a most remarkable man, he said, "God forbid that I should <i>sin</i> against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you", <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#12:23">1 Samuel  12:23</a>.<a name=211:2></a> If you love the brethren, you will pray for them, and then they will have nothing to fear from you.<a name=211:3></a> The saints had nothing to fear from Saul, the sequel shows they had a great deal to gain, and so it is in measure with every praying man.<a name=211:4></a> Prayer moves heaven.<a name=211:5></a> The Lord here in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#9">Luke  9</a>prayed alone.<a name=211:6></a> He did not pray with them, but they were there.<a name=211:7></a> Luke's point was to show that He was a praying Man.<a name=211:8></a> Why was He praying there before them?<a name=211:9></a> They were to learn to pray.<a name=211:10></a> One of the disciples asked the Lord, "Lord, teach us to pray", and He taught them.<a name=211:11></a> There was a point of correspondence between Christ and His followers, they learnt to pray.<a name=211:12></a> The first point is Christ's relation to God, He is a praying Man, and God announces His personal relations with Him.<a name=211:13></a> "Thou art my beloved Son".<a name=211:14></a> This is the Man who is before the eyes of others, praying.<a name=211:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next point is what He is in regard to the devil, <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4">Luke  4</a>.<a name=211:16></a> What came to light in this connection is the perfection of dependence on God.<a name=211:17></a> Man is to live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.<a name=211:18></a> Mark, by <i>every</i> word.<a name=211:19></a> God never says anything aimlessly.<a name=211:20></a> There is no word in the book written aimlessly, and it becomes man to note <i>every</i> word.<a name=211:21></a> If you are to live a true man in this world, you are to live by every word.<a name=211:22></a> We may not feel the need of them, but <i>Jesus did</i>.<a name=211:23></a> He regarded every word of God and lived by them, and doing that He bound the devil.<a name=211:24></a> He put Satan behind Him, but He put man before Him.<a name=211:25></a> Satan is behind Him and is <i>bound</i>, men are all before Him.<a name=211:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next point is all the race of men are before Him.<a name=211:27></a> "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me".<a name=211:28></a> He preaches to all men, we are all before Him there,

	<div class="paragraph">
		Next we get the feverish woman, and feverish people are very difficult to get on with, but the Lord touches her and the fever leaves her; she is affected by the <i>grace</i> of Christ, for she arose and ministered unto them.<a name=212:7></a> Then He goes on to His own city, and as the sun was setting they bring those who were sick with divers diseases to Him and He healed them all.<a name=212:8></a> There was no weariness in Him.<a name=212:9></a> Even in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>the weariness did not prevent the activity of grace.<a name=212:10></a> The Lord <i>must</i> relieve man; being the vessel of grace He must do it.<a name=212:11></a> The Lord was untiring in activity, the sun was setting, and then He says, "I <i>must</i> preach to other cities also".<a name=212:12></a> I wanted to enlarge on the Lord Jesus as showing the grace of God to man.<a name=212:13></a>

		Now in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#9">Luke  9</a>He says, "Whom say ye that I am?<a name=212:14></a>" He wants to know what they have learned.<a name=212:15></a> Peter says, "The Christ of God".<a name=212:16></a> What is your estimate of Him?<a name=212:17></a> What do you say?<a name=212:18></a> Peter says, "<i>The Christ of God</i>".<a name=212:19></a> He was correct and entirely in accord with the Lord's mind.<a name=212:20></a> The Lord had in every way magnified the grace of God to man.<a name=212:21></a> Peter gives an address on that later on.<a name=212:22></a> Now, what is your estimate of Jesus?<a name=212:23></a> That is the question that precedes the glory.<a name=212:24></a> If you have not formed an estimate of Christ you will not see the glory.<a name=212:25></a> Peter had an estimate.<a name=212:26></a> Nicodemus said, "We know thou art a teacher come from God".<a name=212:27></a> Peter said, "The Christ

		When it comes to glory you have the Lord's sovereign selection.<a name=213:5></a> Think of our being selected sovereignly by Christ in order <i>to go up</i>!<a name=213:6></a> Men who have formed a right estimate of Him here are to go up!<a name=213:7></a> How can we be to the praise of the glory of His grace unless we have formed an estimate of Him down <i>here</i>?<a name=213:8></a> He puts the question, "Whom say the people that I am?<a name=213:9></a>" Then He makes a sovereign selection.<a name=213:10></a> He says, "There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God".<a name=213:11></a> It was not to be seen then in the sense of active power down here in this world, but the kingdom of God in the sense of majesty and glory.<a name=213:12></a> We all understand it in natural things.<a name=213:13></a> In the colonies they see the kingdom; that is, they get its protection and prove its power and benefit, but the glory of the kingdom is really seen in London; so the Lord Jesus makes a sovereign selection.<a name=213:14></a> We all are to go up to see His glory, but we go up as those who have an estimate of Christ as the vessel of grace, and it is essential that we should have this estimate if we are to be for the glory of His grace.<a name=213:15></a>

		Two men record for us what was seen.<a name=213:16></a> I like to read Scripture as recorded, and then what a person says: for example, in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10">Acts  10</a>you have Peter's sermon and in chapter 11, Peter gives an account of it, it is interesting to compare them.<a name=213:17></a> It is the same thing here.<a name=213:18></a> You get Luke's account of the transfiguration, and in <a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#1:17">2 Peter  1:17</a> we have Peter's account of it.<a name=213:19></a> He says, "there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son .<a name=213:20></a>.<a name=213:21></a>.<a name=213:22></a> .<a name=213:23></a> And this voice .<a name=213:24></a>.<a name=213:25></a>.<a name=213:26></a> we heard".<a name=213:27></a> Peter had

		Christianity is a spiritual order of things which has been introduced into the world as it is, and yet is entirely apart from it.<a name=216:1></a> John, in his gospel, gives us the spiritual side in Christianity.<a name=216:2></a> Each of the evangelists emphasise among other things a particular side in Christianity, and I think John emphasises what is spiritual.<a name=216:3></a> It is he who tells us that "God is a Spirit", that "that which is born of the Spirit is spirit", and that worship must be "in spirit and in truth".<a name=216:4></a> The words, too, which the Lord spoke, He Himself said were spirit and life; thus we see that John enlarges on that side.<a name=216:5></a> Matthew enlarges on what we might call the legislative or administrative side.<a name=216:6></a> At the outset of his gospel you have the Lord going to the mount in order to inaugurate a new kind of administration.<a name=216:7></a> In Mark, He goes up to the mount to inaugurate a new kind of service, and He takes the disciples up that they might be with Him, in order that He might send them forth to preach.<a name=216:8></a> In Luke, He gives an entirely new order of things; but in John He introduces a totally spiritual order of things.<a name=216:9></a> It may help if we bear in mind that Christianity is a spiritual order of things here in which we are privileged to have part.<a name=216:10></a>

		Referring for a moment to Luke's gospel, in chapter 5 we get a new order of things; the chapter ends with new wine in new bottles.<a name=216:11></a> The new order begins, as the first part of the chapter shows, with men who know how to judge themselves.<a name=216:12></a> "Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord".<a name=216:13></a> Next we see man, a leper by nature, cleansed and brought into the congregation; then the palsied man gets power; that is a new thing, and later there is Levi's house, a totally new thing also; Christianity is seen in a very special way in the Christian household.<a name=216:14></a> A man

		Whichever side is presented in the respective gospels, in each case it is <i>new</i>; it is new legislation in Matthew, new kind of principles; in Mark a new kind of service, because the servants are marked by being in the company of Jesus; in Luke, new circumstances for man.<a name=217:6></a> When you come to John, it is spiritual, and necessarily an out-of-the-world condition of things, and for entrance into this we are wholly dependent on the Spirit of God.<a name=217:7></a> The spiritual in John is in contrast to the natural, or the flesh.<a name=217:8></a> "That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit", not <i>the</i> Spirit, but <i>spirit</i>, the <i>kind</i> of thing it is; that is the fundamental basis of the new structure.<a name=217:9></a> I believe there is a very poor apprehension amongst God's people of what is spiritual, and I think John helps on that line, because he insists that "God is a Spirit", and consequently having to do with God must be on spiritual lines.<a name=217:10></a>

		In chapter 2 there is a scene which is clearly connected with the natural.<a name=217:11></a> The Lord was there at the marriage.<a name=217:12></a> It was not a scene dominated by the principles of the world, for the Lord was invited there, also His disciples, and His being invited was not simply a question of patronising the Lord, as was the case when Simon the Pharisee invited Him to his house, but there was respect for the Lord, as well as respect for His disciples.<a name=217:13></a> One has often said, if you respect a man you respect his family.<a name=217:14></a> The

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 3 He is the Bridegroom, He is recognised as the Bridegroom, but that again is on spiritual lines.<a name=218:5></a> In the beginning of the chapter we see how the transition from the natural to the spiritual takes place.<a name=218:6></a> We are transferred in our hearts and minds from what is natural to what is spiritual.<a name=218:7></a> John the baptist proves himself to be spiritual in that he recognises the heavenly, and disappears in the presence of it, verses 30, 31.<a name=218:8></a> That is an illustration of what a spiritual man is.<a name=218:9></a> Now in verse 35 you have man in the Person of Christ recognised in His supremacy as Administrator.<a name=218:10></a> "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand"; that is to say, He has the administration of what is of God; and in chapter 4 we see, that what He is administering is spiritual.<a name=218:11></a> "The water which I shall give him shall be in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life".<a name=218:12></a> Luke gives in a beautiful way God and man; but here in John it is the Father and the Son, so it is a system proceeding from the affections of divine Persons.<a name=218:13></a> We know that the Son will administer the kingdom in the future, and reign over the house of Jacob for ever, but John is not occupied with that, but with Christianity; and so we get, "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water".<a name=218:14></a> He has something to give, and what He has to give is spiritual, "living water".<a name=218:15></a>

		To compare again for a moment these two gospels, Luke and John, Luke gives us more what is in the presence of the world as the result of, Christ's death and resurrection.<a name=219:1></a> We have His being anointed, the official side, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor".<a name=219:2></a> That is external, but depends on what is internal; the effect was public.<a name=219:3></a> Christianity is the result of that, seen in people known in the world, who have been taken up by the Lord, and are changed.<a name=219:4></a> John gives, as I have said, what is spiritual, and when you come to that, you are connected with the unseen side of things; with God and Christ, with the Father and the Son.<a name=219:5></a> You have access to an unseen order of things, to what is spiritual.<a name=219:6></a> What you get in chapter 13 depends on these things, and your thought of Christ must necessarily be spiritual.<a name=219:7></a>

		The Lord was going out of the world, and He was going to the Father; these are two distinct things, His going out and His going in; a good many days intervened historically between them.<a name=219:8></a> On the mount of transfiguration Moses and Elias were speaking to the Lord about His decease <i>which He should accomplish at Jerusalem</i>, not about His going to heaven.<a name=219:9></a> You must go out to go in.<a name=219:10></a> The Lord went out in order to go in, with us there must be the acceptance of death in affection and attraction to Him; and this involves complete severance from the world.<a name=219:11></a> There is a great deal more in it than you are apt at first sight to think.<a name=219:12></a> Heaven is not your side at all, you are <i>taken</i> there; you could not go to heaven of yourself if you wanted to.<a name=219:13></a> It is no act of yours, you have no power to go; but you have obligation and power to go out of the world.<a name=219:14></a> I think it is well to see that: going put of the world is a question of obligation.<a name=219:15></a> Whilst the Lord was here in it you could not go out of it; you could not leave it whilst He was here; but He has gone out of it, and He

		It is on my mind to show how we are to walk together.<a name=311:1></a> You will observe that the locusts referred to here are one of four species of creatures that are said to be exceeding wise.<a name=311:2></a> Christianity is a dispensation in which wisdom shines.<a name=311:3></a> The gospels present to us wisdom personified in Christ, and the effect of the ministry of Christ was to produce children of wisdom, and these children of wisdom were to carry on wisdom's activities during the period of the absence of the Lord from the earth.<a name=311:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Among other things, what you find in the Acts is that the children of wisdom walk together.<a name=311:5></a> The word <i>together</i> is very prominent in the record, at least, the idea conveyed in it is.<a name=311:6></a> We are told that the Lord "added to the assembly (probably it is 'added together') such as should be saved".<a name=311:7></a> In the light of that in the next chapter, you find two of them, Peter and John, walking up together into the temple.<a name=311:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It may seem a very insignificant matter that they should have walked up <i>together</i>, but they walked in wisdom to the temple, hence they walked <i>together</i>.<a name=311:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, there was a man lame from his birth lying at the temple gate, and here are two of wisdom's children walking together.<a name=311:10></a> It is a most remarkable incident in its bearing.<a name=311:11></a> There is human need at the gate of the temple, but the temple was unavailing; human need was unalleviated by the temple.<a name=311:12></a> Peter said to the man, "Look on us".<a name=311:13></a> He did not say, "Look on <i>me</i>".<a name=311:14></a> He said "Look on us".<a name=311:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Look on whom?<a name=311:16></a> Two of wisdom's children walking in wisdom's dignity, walking together.<a name=311:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that is a pattern of the Christian dispensation in its bearing towards the need of this world.<a name=311:18></a> Suppose you contrast that with what we have today.<a name=311:19></a>

		no silver, they have no gold, they have no learning according to man; they have no social or religious status; they have no political status, and yet they appeal to the man in need; and they say, "Look on us".<a name=312:1></a> Now, contrast that with what we have become accustomed to.<a name=312:2></a> Suppose we, as <i>outwardly</i> responsible for and connected with Christendom, say, "Look on us".<a name=312:3></a> What a spectacle!<a name=312:4></a> Is there any wisdom, any love, <i>outwardly</i>?<a name=312:5></a> The whole fabric is so far removed from that which Peter and John presented to that man, that it is utterly unrecognisable.<a name=312:6></a> We have to accept it; we cannot escape from it.<a name=312:7></a> Obviously it is wisdom on the part of God's people at the present time to accept it; yet, if we are to be locusts; that is, among the wise but weak things in the world, our course is to go back to <i>first principles</i>.<a name=312:8></a> You only require another and yourself to get the working out of first principles.<a name=312:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In referring to first principles, I would for a moment suggest the idea of <i>brethren</i>.<a name=312:10></a> We can lift up our heads in regard of that precious designation.<a name=312:11></a> I know of no designation that one cherishes more than <i>brethren</i>, and what one finds in Scripture is that recovery is to that.<a name=312:12></a> Referring back for a moment to the Old Testament, Joseph is the type of Christ as having brethren.<a name=312:13></a> It is true that Isaac had brethren, and it is true that Jacob had a brother; but Joseph is singled out by the Spirit as the type of Christ as having brethren.<a name=312:14></a> Let me call your attention in this connection to the fact that at the first meeting of Joseph with his brethren he elicited from them the truth as to first principles.<a name=312:15></a> What was that truth?<a name=312:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was confessed in this way: "Thy servants are <i>twelve</i> brethren, the sons of one man".<a name=312:17></a> Not <i>eleven</i> brethren.<a name=312:18></a> Never omit from your mind or your heart any one of the saints.<a name=312:19></a> The confession made was remarkable, a forecast of the ultimate result of the meeting with Joseph.<a name=312:20></a> What a happy prospect for

	<div class="paragraph">
		When we proceed with the narrative in Genesis we find that Judah is brought to the state becoming to brethren.<a name=313:12></a> It had been a long, I may say painful, process that brought him to it; but in the final crisis the state which is found in Judah is becoming to brethren.<a name=313:13></a> In this respect it is no question of having them all.<a name=313:14></a> The point is for you and for me to see to it that we are in the state of a brother.<a name=313:15></a> If the state suited to a brother is found in you, you will find others.<a name=313:16></a> Now Judah says to Joseph in the crisis at the end, "My lord asked his servants, saying, Have you a father, or a brother?<a name=313:17></a>" A wonderful question to be raised!<a name=313:18></a> Has it ever been raised in your soul?<a name=313:19></a> The question as to your Father and as to your brethren?<a name=313:20></a> That is a family question; that is not a national question.<a name=313:21></a> There is far too much national sentiment among God's people.<a name=313:22></a> It is quite right to have national sentiment in regard to a "holy nation", but where is the holy nation?<a name=313:23></a> Is this country a holy nation, or any other country today?<a name=313:24></a> There is none.<a name=313:25></a> Do not put up one against another; not one of them is holy; not one of them.<a name=313:26></a> The patience of

		God lingers over them, not on account of their holiness or their righteousness; the explanation of it is all found in the nature of God; He is long-suffering, not willing that any should perish.<a name=314:1></a> There is only one "holy nation", and that is God's people, who have His Spirit.<a name=314:2></a> But there is a family, and that family has one Father and it is composed of brethren.<a name=314:3></a> And so you find Judah evincing the state becoming a brother.<a name=314:4></a> He is prepared to be a bond-slave for ever for Benjamin.<a name=314:5></a> Is not that the spirit of a brother?<a name=314:6></a> How different when he became a party to the selling of Joseph.<a name=314:7></a> Now he is prepared to be a bond-slave for ever for his youngest brother Benjamin.<a name=314:8></a> The state becoming a brother is that which is seen in consideration for the Father and in consideration for the brethren.<a name=314:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, having said all that about brethren, I turn to the passage in Proverbs, because in the light of Christianity it is really based on the relationship suited to brethren.<a name=314:10></a> The love that is becoming in brethren works out in such wise as to bring us into reproach in the world.<a name=314:11></a> The locusts are little but they are wise.<a name=314:12></a> Now wherein is their wisdom seen?<a name=314:13></a> It is seen in this, that they go forth by bands.<a name=314:14></a> In the economy set up in Paul's ministry the brethren were to go by bands.<a name=314:15></a> I want to show you how it came about in a simple, practical way.<a name=314:16></a> Because, although we can never, as a whole, hope to present anything in the way of public testimony now, we can return to first principles and maintain them in so far as we are in touch with our brethren.<a name=314:17></a> And I repeat, the more you find the state becoming to brethren the more brethren you will find.<a name=314:18></a> You never surrender in your soul the principle of the twelve.<a name=314:19></a> I use the number twelve as a symbol of the whole.<a name=314:20></a> So that you meet a Christian anywhere, and if you have evidence of his genuineness, he is one of the number.<a name=314:21></a> I want to show you how you are to treat

		the brethren.<a name=315:1></a> I refer to the passage I read in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#5">Matthew  5</a>.<a name=315:2></a> Now the gospel of Matthew is distinguished from the other gospels, and among other things, by this, that it presents a <i>new legislation</i>.<a name=315:3></a> I have no doubt that Mark gives us a new kind of ministry, whereas Luke gives us a new order of things.<a name=315:4></a> Matthew gives us from the ministry of Christ a new legislation.<a name=315:5></a> Hence the Lord is seen in this gospel as going up into a mountain and sitting down and calmly setting forth a law for the government of His people.<a name=315:6></a> Now He comes to a phase of the law which has reference to brethren.<a name=315:7></a> How are we to regard them?<a name=315:8></a> How are we to speak to one another?<a name=315:9></a> The Lord begins by saying, "Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill .<a name=315:10></a>.<a name=315:11></a>.<a name=315:12></a> but I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment".<a name=315:13></a> Now the Lord intends to convey by this teaching, that we are to regard each other <i>not</i> as in the flesh.<a name=315:14></a> I believe that the secret of all the dissension and dissatisfaction amongst the saints lies in taking account of each other as in the flesh.<a name=315:15></a> First of all you are angry without a cause; then secondly you say, My brother is vain; he is a vain fellow, "Raca".<a name=315:16></a> He is vain if you look at him in the flesh.<a name=315:17></a> There is not one of us who is not vain after the flesh, and if you look at your brother in that light he is certainly vain.<a name=315:18></a> But what are you doing in looking at him in that light?<a name=315:19></a> You are uncovering his nakedness, and I leave it with you to find out from Scripture what that means.<a name=315:20></a> The Lord does not hesitate here to indicate to you the seriousness of it.<a name=315:21></a> I want you to follow what I am saying as to uncovering the nakedness of a brother.<a name=315:22></a> In <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#3">Genesis  3</a>you have the idea of covering.<a name=315:23></a> God brought in a covering for both Adam and Eve, but in chapter 9 Ham would set it aside, and he became witness of the nakedness of his father; he disregarded the covering.<a name=315:24></a>

		Now it is quite possible that a brother may expose himself.<a name=316:1></a> Alas!<a name=316:2></a> we are all too conscious of this danger.<a name=316:3></a> Noah exposed himself, he got drunk.<a name=316:4></a> You might say Ham had a very good reason for speaking about his father.<a name=316:5></a> Very well.<a name=316:6></a> The Spirit of God tells us that Canaan was cursed for it.<a name=316:7></a> Shem and Japheth, on the other hand, went backwards with a garment and covered the nakedness of their father.<a name=316:8></a> I refer to that so that you may see the importance of taking account of the saints as covered by Christ.<a name=316:9></a> If you habituate yourself to taking account of them as in the flesh you will come into judgment governmentally, depend upon it.<a name=316:10></a> The Canaanitish nations came under God's curse for it.<a name=316:11></a> "Cursed be Canaan, a servant of servants shall he be".<a name=316:12></a> And for what?<a name=316:13></a> For disregarding, for thinking and speaking lightly of the nakedness of his near relative.<a name=316:14></a> There is a heavy penalty attached to it, and so in the typical books you find that the uncovering of a near relative is prohibited with the curse of God.<a name=316:15></a> The opposite to that is that we look at each other as clothed with the glorious garment of Christ.<a name=316:16></a> How different a brother is now!<a name=316:17></a> You would not go without him now.<a name=316:18></a> So you come to the altar of God with your offering, <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#5:23">Matthew  5:23</a>.<a name=316:19></a> What about your brother now?<a name=316:20></a> You remember him there.<a name=316:21></a> Depend upon it you will have cause to remember him there.<a name=316:22></a> "And there rememberest that thy brother" -- thy brother -- "hath aught against thee".<a name=316:23></a> What about it now?<a name=316:24></a> He is your brother.<a name=316:25></a> Ah!<a name=316:26></a> you say he has no good reason to have anything against me; he has no reason to be angry with me.<a name=316:27></a> Is that the language of your lips?<a name=316:28></a> Well, your brother has aught against you; you must have him, he is your brother, he is one of the twelve, and God will not have a vacant space; they must all be there.<a name=316:29></a> You will remember how in the book of Deuteronomy, chapter 16, all the males are told to appear before God three times in the year.<a name=316:30></a>

		What are you going to do about it?<a name=317:11></a> God is raising the question with you.<a name=317:12></a> Go and get him.<a name=317:13></a> Depend upon it that is largely our responsibility today.<a name=317:14></a> We are to be set for the recovery of our brethren.<a name=317:15></a> God will take up their side some day, they will come to the altar; there is no hope for them if they do not.<a name=317:16></a> They may claim to be brethren, but if they do not come to the altar of God they have no claim to the title.<a name=317:17></a> But some day they will come; they will all come and then you may depend upon it that God will raise the question with them.<a name=317:18></a> But never mind, for the moment your brother is not there.<a name=317:19></a> The twelve are not together.<a name=317:20></a> Now the Lord says, "Leave there thy gift before the altar .<a name=317:21></a>.<a name=317:22></a>.<a name=317:23></a> first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift".<a name=317:24></a> You do not bring him there, but you go and remove what hinders him coming.<a name=317:25></a> That is according to the Christian dispensation; and it is now a time of recovery, recovery to first principles.<a name=317:26></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=337:3></a> I think <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>is Deuteronomy ground.<a name=337:4></a> The believer is there viewed as having formally come to the recognition of the Spirit, and now there is room for Christ in the heart.<a name=337:5></a> Whilst we must not lay too much stress on the Old Testament in this connection, I think Deuteronomy suggests the thought of headship, because headship implies, that the one who is head has an interest in you and that he has wisdom, so that whilst in the end of Numbers you have the statement, "these are the commandments of the Lord", and "the Lord commanded Moses", in the book of Deuteronomy it is what Moses himself says to the people.<a name=337:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=337:14></a> Yes.<a name=337:15></a> The mediatorial system is not prominent in Deuteronomy, and so the priesthood is not much in view, but the people are viewed as in direct relationship with God.<a name=337:16></a> In fact in one chapter they are called the sons of God.<a name=337:17></a> We are reminded in chapter 1 that there are only eleven days' journey from mount Sinai to Kadesh, whereas it really took forty years, meaning that from the divine side the distance is very short.<a name=337:18></a> The people are reminded that it was so; but although the distance was so short they did not avail themselves of it.<a name=337:19></a> I think there is great slothfulness in us, as in them, to lay hold of what is so near to us.<a name=337:20></a> You get the house of God in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#28">Genesis  28</a>, it was quite near to heaven, it was "the gate of heaven", and yet Jacob did not take advantage of it, though there was a testimony that the distance was very short.<a name=337:21></a> I think it is developed here that it is Christ who draws us in.<a name=337:22></a> There is

		A NEW STATE BY THE FORMATION OF CHRIST

	<div class="paragraph">
		E.R.<a name=352:1></a> Would you mind repeating a remark you made yesterday as to the difference between "<i>the</i> body" and "<i>his</i> body"?<a name=352:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=352:3></a> I thought that "the body" is a definite thing, having come in in addition to other things which had existed before, of which the Lord is stated formally to be Head.<a name=352:4></a> The body is a definite thing to be taken account of in the mind by itself, and then later on the apostle says "his body", which is the assembly.<a name=352:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is doubtful whether we can get a right understanding of the place of the assembly as viewed in the Ephesians unless we see how it is formed now in affection and intelligence.<a name=352:6></a> Another practical effect of the knowledge of the assembly, as seen in Colossians, is that it enables saints locally, however few, to be independent spiritually; it teaches saints to get a direct supply from the Head, provided that the conditions stated exist.<a name=352:7></a> Hence the apostle's great combat in the epistle to the Colossians was in regard to those conditions.<a name=352:8></a> The gain of the Head depends not only on the fact that Christ is Head, but upon a certain state, so that the burden of the apostle's exercise was that the hearts of the saints locally "should be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the full knowledge of the mystery of God; in which are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge".<a name=352:9></a> I thought a little on that line might aid saints locally to derive the benefit of the Head, for the word "mystery" in that passage I suppose implies not only the Head but the body.<a name=352:10></a>

		My desire is to seek to show how saints come into the good of the headship of Christ, and that in coming into the gain of it, Christ becomes known to us, not only as guiding us individually, but in regard of all that is in the mind of God.<a name=386:1></a> It has to be borne in mind that whilst His headship is special to us it also extends, in the principle of it, to all the creation.<a name=386:2></a> In this way we come to value the Lord not only according to what He is to us, but according to what He is to God.<a name=386:3></a> The Godhead has undertaken through Him to "reconcile all things to itself", and the more we know Him, the more we desire to see this accomplished; to see all things put under Him.<a name=386:4></a> The Lord Jesus Himself created different offices, thrones, principalities, powers, and He created them all in view of the reconciliation of all things.<a name=386:5></a> Others were placed provisionally in these offices only to show how incapable they were, and to make obvious the necessity for Christ to appear, so that He should take up each office and fill it efficiently.<a name=386:6></a> Now a right understanding of Christ as Head and of that which flows from it enables us in the way of education to take in that expanded scope, and hence we come to value Him the more.<a name=386:7></a>

		Now as to the world, it is just as well that things should be uncovered for us; but as to the saints, one would not uncover them, because God has covered them, and it is one of the most grievous offences known in Scripture to uncover one's brethren, to uncover the nakedness of their flesh.<a name=387:3></a> I dwell on it just for a moment.<a name=387:4></a> God has been pleased to take us up and cover us.<a name=387:5></a> First of all there is the covering of nakedness, then you have the idea of covering for adornment.<a name=387:6></a> He has covered us in order to hide up the nakedness, and woe be to the man who uncovers what God has covered!<a name=387:7></a> It is a terrible thing to dwell on what our brethren are or may be after the flesh, and that is what we are prone to, to dwell on what a brother may be after the flesh; that is to uncover his nakedness, and there is no more grievous offence known in Scripture than that.<a name=387:8></a> One would not be engaged in that; it is the work of the enemy.<a name=387:9></a> One has seen a history of the Lord's people written for the eyes of the world.<a name=387:10></a> Uncovering all their failures, all their nakedness!<a name=387:11></a> Think of that!<a name=387:12></a>

		It is important to connect <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>with <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#19">Exodus  19</a>, as it answers to it, and it would help if we were to see that the covenant, which God has been pleased to make, involves a certain kind of relationships and affections.<a name=408:1></a> These are in themselves distinct from the relationships and affections connected with the revelation of the Father, which involve the family.<a name=408:2></a> We have to do with God in both these connections, and the family connection is the higher, and is that which will abide.<a name=408:3></a> The covenant relationships connect themselves with our circumstances here, and stand in relation to God.<a name=408:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not say that the family relationships are not connected with God, because God is our Father, but the covenant supposes that at one time we were not in relationship with God, for a covenant is, according to the type, formally entered into; whereas, as children or sons, we are from the outset related to God; as children we are said to be born of God and as sons we are adopted, all from the divine side.<a name=408:5></a> It is very interesting that in suggesting the covenant, God condescended to commend Himself to the people, and so in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>He commends His love to us.<a name=408:6></a> In proposing to enter into a covenant with Israel, He called attention to what He had done for them, what He did to the Egyptians, and how He had borne His people upon eagles' wings and brought them to Himself.<a name=408:7></a> God then proposes that if they should keep His covenant and obey Him, certain consequences would follow, as much as to suggest that it was worth their while to enter into a

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is the Christian's privilege to take up everything in relation to God; his family and his business, all is now on that ground.<a name=409:3></a> In Timothy we are told that every creature of God is good and to be received with thanksgiving, for "it is sanctified by God's word and freely addressing him".<a name=409:4></a> That is to say, God is admitted into everything; you do not keep Him out of any part of the sphere for which you are responsible.<a name=409:5></a> Obviously we must begin with a certain understanding with God, and this is what covenant suggests.<a name=409:6></a>

		The earlier chapters of Romans show what God has been to us, and in chapter 5 the suggestion is that it is worth our while to enter into covenant with such a God as this.<a name=409:7></a> God is pleased even to commend His love to us, as though He would say, Now you know; so that the soul has an understanding with God.<a name=409:8></a> Romans regards us as men here upon earth, once alienated and away from God.<a name=409:9></a> Now He has come out to where we were; in this chapter He appeals to what He has done.<a name=409:10></a> He commends His love to us, not as His children or His sons, but as those who were sinners, who were without strength.<a name=409:11></a> So that it comes to this in one's soul: Is one prepared to enter into this understanding with God?<a name=409:12></a> He has reserved nothing; indeed it is most touching to consider how God has come out unreservedly.<a name=409:13></a> He has held back nothing.<a name=409:14></a> He said to the people, "Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians", and then He makes the proposal that there should be a definite bond between Him and them.<a name=409:15></a> I think it is a most important question to raise in one's soul as to whether there is that understanding with God; whether, as a responsible

		God intended that He should become an object for the soul.<a name=410:6></a> I think that is quite left out in the popular preaching of the day.<a name=410:7></a> God's thought is that, as delivered, there should be an understanding between Him and us, and not only so, but a definite bond to which He has committed Himself to begin with, and to which we also have committed ourselves, because it is in our committal to it that the conscience is brought into play.<a name=410:8></a> If you commit yourself to a bond, and you are at all honest, you must be consistent.<a name=410:9></a> This chapter shows, in the experience of at least one man, Paul, that he had found it a profitable bond.<a name=410:10></a> He had found it worth while to take it up, because this is a triumphant record of his experience.<a name=410:11></a> God having acquired a permanent place in the heart of the believer, it is God's thought that the believer should put out his hand, as it were, and commit himself.<a name=410:12></a>

		Before entering upon the subject named at the head of this paper, it may be well to make a few remarks upon the value of the Old Testament scriptures as compared with those of the New Testament.<a name=434:1></a> In writing his second epistle to Timothy, Paul says "Every scripture is divinely inspired, and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God may be complete, fully fitted to every good work", chapter 3: 16, 17.<a name=434:2></a> Special attention should be paid to the above passage, as appearing in an apostolic epistle intended for the "last days".<a name=434:3></a> "Scripture" here includes the Old Testament; indeed the "sacred letters", which Timothy knew from childhood, are the Old Testament scriptures.<a name=434:4></a> There is a disposition to discredit or undervalue the Old Testament; this the Spirit of God foresaw, and guarded it by the above passage.<a name=434:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In order to profit by the reading of the Scriptures we must recognise the Spirit of God, by whose aid alone we can understand their meaning; and, further, an important injunction appearing also in 2 Timothy, must be observed.<a name=434:6></a> Paul speaks of "cutting in a straight line the word of truth", chapter 2: 15.<a name=434:7></a> Observing this, and depending on the Holy Spirit, we shall "behold wondrous things" in the Old Testament scriptures as well as in those of the New Testament.<a name=434:8></a> We need both.<a name=434:9></a> No Christian should conclude that the New Testament alone furnishes all that his soul needs.<a name=434:10></a> The passage quoted shows that all Scripture is inspired of God, and is profitable and necessary for the furnishing of the

		man of God.<a name=435:1></a> The New Testament has, indeed, the first place: it presents to us, in the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ, the revelation of God; man as seen in Christ before Him for His pleasure and glorifying Him; accomplished redemption; the exaltation of Christ; the gift of the Holy Spirit, and the consequent formation of the assembly; the counsels of God as regards Christ and the assembly; the disposition of the earth as ruled over by Christ, with Israel restored to their own city and land, according to the promises made to the fathers.<a name=435:2></a> These great and blessed subjects, involving the glory of God in Christ, and a creation blessed in Him, are presented to us in divine perfection and fulness in the holy pages of the gospels and the epistles "by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven", <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:12">1 Peter  1:12</a>.<a name=435:3></a> The words "sent from heaven" are to be specially noted.<a name=435:4></a> The Holy Spirit on earth, as given by a glorified Christ, involves a freshness, and vigour in all that is ministered which the earlier scriptures do not afford.<a name=435:5></a> The Christian lives, normally, in what is thus presented as in his native atmosphere.<a name=435:6></a>

		But to be complete, fully fitted, he needs all the holy writings.<a name=435:7></a> The Old Testament, in type, gives direct statements of truth, record of experiences and breathings of the Spirit of Christ in holy men of God; it furnishes amplifications, elucidations, and adorning details of New Testament truth, which, if the Christian neglects, he must suffer great loss.<a name=435:8></a> In a word, the Old Testament, in every section of it, bears witness of CHRIST.<a name=435:9></a> We read in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24">Luke  24</a>that the Lord expounded "in all the scriptures the things concerning himself".<a name=435:10></a> How delightful such an exposition must have been!<a name=435:11></a> It is not recorded, but if we are subject to the Holy Spirit, and attentive to Him, we shall be led into the understanding of the things written concerning Christ "in the law of Moses, and in the prophets and in the psalms".<a name=435:12></a> Indeed the

		What may be remarked here is that the term law is not always limited in the New Testament to the Ten Commandments; it is more often referred to as covering the whole Mosaic ceremonial system, and in one or two instances, the whole of the Old Testament.<a name=436:6></a> In Galatians and Hebrews the reference is generally to the ceremonial system of which circumcision was the sign.<a name=436:7></a> It was "the law of commandments in ordinances".<a name=436:8></a> In Hebrews the law is contrasted with the great spiritual system set up in Christ, who came by the "greater and more perfect tabernacle".<a name=436:9></a> In Galatians "the principle of works of law", as presented in the literal Mosaic system, including the Ten Commandments, for justification, is utterly condemned.<a name=436:10></a> The vigour and zeal with which the apostle combatted the Judaising error is explained by the serious nature of the error itself; and also by the fearful result of it as seen around today in the ceremonial religion of Christendom.<a name=436:11></a> It is important that the far-reaching nature of the error, as thus seen, should be understood, lest anyone should labour under the misapprehension that the law in its spiritual significance is abrogated.<a name=436:12></a> Its "righteous requirement" is "fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh, but according to Spirit", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:4">Romans  8:4</a>.<a name=436:13></a> Indeed, this is taught in the Galatian epistle itself.<a name=436:14></a> "The whole law", says the apostle, "is fulfilled in one word, in, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself", <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#5:14">Galatians  5:14</a>.<a name=436:15></a> This involves a

	<div class="paragraph">
		Having said so much about the references to the law in the New Testament, so as to clarify and guard our subject, we may now look at the section of Moses in which the law is introduced, namely, <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#19">Exodus  19</a>to 24.<a name=437:3></a> Our inquiry is, Does this section, with the other parts of the book, afford typical teaching, or is it to be regarded only as recording the historical facts of the giving of the law, as viewed, for instance, in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:18">Hebrews  12:18</a> - 21?<a name=437:4></a> As already pointed out, the New Testament writings largely treat the law, the Ten Commandments and the whole ceremonial system connected with them, as given by God, expressing His rights as regards man (Israel) as he was; who being thus tested disclosed the lawless state of his heart.<a name=437:5></a> "Why then the law?<a name=437:6></a> It was added for the sake of transgressions", <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3:19">Galatians  3:19</a>.<a name=437:7></a> It was a schoolmaster to those who were under it up to Christ.<a name=437:8></a> By it was the knowledge of sin, and the terrible fact established that those that are in the flesh cannot please God.<a name=437:9></a> The carnal mind is not subject to the law of God, nor can it be.<a name=437:10></a> The law supposed sin in those to whom it was given, for it was "not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#1:9">1 Timothy  1:9</a>.<a name=437:11></a> All this, and very much more on the same line, is seen on the face of Scripture, and hence is of the greatest importance for the saints.<a name=437:12></a>

		A question arises here as to whether the position of Israel, with whom the covenant was made, shadowed in any way that of the people of God in this dispensation.<a name=439:10></a> The distance established between God and the Israelites and the terrible solemnity which marked the actual giving of the law speak with great plainness of the divine intent in the scene presented.<a name=439:11></a> He had acted in grace up to this time, had borne them on eagles' wings and brought them to Himself.<a name=439:12></a> Now the people are to be impressed with the majesty and holiness of the God whose love and power had already beer shown.<a name=439:13></a> On the other hand, the solemn question of their state had to be raised.<a name=439:14></a>

		The awful fact is before us that man in the flesh,, however favoured outwardly, is utterly unfit for the presence of God.<a name=440:1></a> He is as an unclean thing, and all his righteousnesses are as filthy rags.<a name=440:2></a> God knew all this from the outset, but the awe-inspiring scene at Sinai was to impress it on the Israelites, and on the whole race of man.<a name=440:3></a> That there may have been a.<a name=440:4></a> Joshua or others in the camp, who had faith, and who thus were known and loved of God, made no difference.<a name=440:5></a> The same solemn lesson must be learnt by all.<a name=440:6></a> Even Moses said, "I am exceedingly afraid and full of trembling".<a name=440:7></a> This fact shows that the scene was extraordinary, God emphasising His majesty if man in the flesh presumes to undertake to do His will.<a name=440:8></a> This testimony being thus rendered, the book of the law and the people were sprinkled by blood, showing that all should ultimately be secured through redemption, the redemption which is in Christ Jesus.<a name=440:9></a>

		We may return now to the typical feature of the position of the people.<a name=440:10></a> Taking full note, as we have, of the main teaching of the scripture before us, we may, point out that there is the general fact of a people taken into relationship with God on the ground of obedience.<a name=440:11></a> There is no blood mentioned in chapter 19 but it is introduced in chapter 24.<a name=440:12></a> In the latter chapter the blood is directly connected with the undertaking of the people to obey, as if to intimate that the obligation could be fulfilled only through redemption.<a name=440:13></a> The challenge on God's part to man to obey is morally right.<a name=440:14></a> It cannot be divorced from His expressed will in any dispensation or circumstance.<a name=440:15></a> The fact that Israel could not keep the law did not cancel their responsibility; nor could the law fall to the ground.<a name=440:16></a> The Lord said that every jot and tittle of it shall come to pass.<a name=440:17></a> Hence alongside the anticipated failure of Israel we have the beautiful type of Christ presented in the Hebrew

		The truth, therefore, is that whether Israel undertook to keep the law or not, the responsibility was there, for God claimed obedience; but they did not have the heart to obey, as Jehovah in His love exclaimed later, "O that there were such a heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever!<a name=441:7></a>" <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#5:29">Deuteronomy  5:29</a>.<a name=441:8></a> But Christ had "such a heart"; He undertook to do the will of God, saying, "Lo, I come to do thy will, O God".<a name=441:9></a> He had the law in His heart, magnifying it and making it honourable.<a name=441:10></a> Christ undertook to obey in becoming Man; He has led the way in obedience, and so Christians are sanctified to His obedience, <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:2">1 Peter  1:2</a>.<a name=441:11></a> Hence, redemption accomplished, He brings in a people before God who are of His own order and pattern, and they obey.<a name=441:12></a> This is true, in principle, of Christians as of those in whose mind and hearts, in the future, God's laws shall be given and written.<a name=441:13></a> They obey from the heart the form of teaching into which, they were instructed, <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:17">Romans  6:17</a>.<a name=441:14></a>

		Lest there should be any misapprehension, we would remark that the believer's justification, his reception of the Holy Ghost, his relationship with God and with Christ, and his place in the divine counsels, are all secured, according to the gospel, through his faith in God and in the work of Christ.<a name=443:7></a> God effects all on the ground of pure grace.<a name=443:8></a> What we have been dwelling upon has reference to the Christian as left down here in the wilderness.<a name=443:9></a> Viewed thus he is regarded as in a spiritual system, set up in Christ, to which he has committed himself.<a name=443:10></a> Through baptism and the Lord's supper he commits himself to this spiritual system, which is marked by the perfect law of liberty, as truly, and indeed as formally, as the Israelites committed themselves to the system set up through Moses.<a name=443:11></a>

		In conclusion, then, we would say that the general thought presented in the section of Scripture before us, is of a people brought to God in grace and in power, and then set up in covenant relations with Him: they accepting the terms of the covenant (the feature dealing with God's holiness and man's sinfulness has already been enlarged upon), and then blood sprinkled both on the book itself and all

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=462:1></a> We saw previously that the end of Luke's gospel presents the Lord as the Blesser, blessing a company upon earth; and having blessed them He is parted from them, and carried up into heaven.<a name=462:2></a> You have presented a company, blessed on earth, with the Blesser hid in heaven.<a name=462:3></a> This might be linked on with the millennial condition of things, a company blessed on earth.<a name=462:4></a> Whereas, chapter 9 of this book, which, as we know, is recorded by the same writer, presents Christ speaking out of heaven, and owning those that were on earth as His body; so that He is no longer parted from them.<a name=462:5></a> They are His body; and the body is vitally bound up with its head; there is no such thought as separation from it.<a name=462:6></a> Hence the position now is heavenly.<a name=462:7></a> The saints, persecuted, are Himself, really.<a name=462:8></a> And in connection with that, we have what is called "a light out of heaven"; a very suggestive thought.<a name=462:9></a> One has observed, lately, the frequency with which Mr.<a name=462:10></a> Darby's hymns have been sung amongst us; and it is noticeable how much the idea of "heavenly light" is found in them.<a name=462:11></a> Light itself is precious; I mean to say, if you are in a dark scene, light of any kind is to be desired; you may not think for the moment of the kind of light; it is a question of light.<a name=462:12></a> God has said, "Let there be light, and there was light".<a name=462:13></a> It was not a question where it came from; it was simply that the necessity for it was apparent, and the divine word brought it into existence.<a name=462:14></a> But then, in the book of Genesis, we have

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the gospel of Luke Christ is seen on earth, as the Vessel of grace; in the Acts He is seen in heaven; and from chapter 7, onwards, the centre of the divine operations is transferred from Jerusalem to heaven; and the light now issues from heaven, instead of Jerusalem.<a name=463:2></a> The temple was in Jerusalem of old, and hence light came from Jerusalem; but now it comes from heaven.<a name=463:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=463:10></a> Quite so; he was affected by the light from heaven.<a name=463:11></a> We have to distinguish between an earthly remnant and their exercises and feelings, and a heavenly people.<a name=463:12></a> The earthly in the future will have certain exercises, which will find expression in the books of Psalms.<a name=463:13></a> If they have enemies, they call for vengeance on them.<a name=463:14></a> Now that does not describe the exercises of a heavenly man.<a name=463:15></a> He never calls for vengeance on his enemies.<a name=463:16></a> Stephen says, "Lord, lay not this sin to their charge".<a name=463:17></a> That indicates what the body is.<a name=463:18></a> That may be a crude way of putting it; but it is well to be practical.<a name=463:19></a> One feature of the body is seen in "Lord, lay not this sin to their charge".<a name=463:20></a> One of Christ's members was saying that.<a name=463:21></a> It was a reflection of Christ.<a name=463:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		HOW THE TRUTH OF THE ASSEMBLY APPEARED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF GOD'S WAYS (3)

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20:17">Acts  20:17</a> - 38
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=474:1></a> I think this chapter is the end of Paul's active ministry.<a name=474:2></a> When I say active, you will remember that it was after this he was imprisoned; he went to Rome.<a name=474:3></a> One would gather, from what was said here, "that they should see his face no more", that his active ministry among the saints had come to a close, at least, as far as the divine record goes.<a name=474:4></a> In sending for the elders at Ephesus, he intended to convey his final verbal message to the assembly; and the wording of it would indicate that Ephesus, as a local company, represented the assembly as it had been formed by Paul's ministry.<a name=474:5></a> He had withheld nothing from these Christians; he had declared unto them the whole counsel of God, which would indicate that there was a state there answering to those counsels.<a name=474:6></a> He could not communicate to the Corinthians in the same way, on account of their state; he says so definitely; he could speak wisdom among the perfect, but not to the Corinthians.<a name=474:7></a> So it is evident that the Ephesian believers were perfect, in that sense; they were fully developed; and therefore they were set, at to their state, in the love of Christ; for we know afterwards that the Lord speaks to them, and says, "I have against thee because thou hast left thy first love".<a name=474:8></a> I understand that Paul had placed them there; he had so presented Christ to them, in his ministry, that they were set in His love.<a name=474:9></a> That it is what one might call the climax, as it has indeed been called, the climax of his ministry, the top stone of his ministry.<a name=474:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=475:3></a> Yes; the epistle is more a record; what is put down in writing is to remain; it is an inspired account of the counsels of God; of the place that Christ and the assembly have in the divine counsels.<a name=475:4></a> That is really what the epistle is for.<a name=475:5></a> It is more than a local epistle, it contemplates Jew and Gentile formed into one body; so that it is that part of Scripture which is, so to say, our heavenly charter; it gives us our heavenly position.<a name=475:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=475:13></a> No, the assembly was.<a name=475:14></a> The assembly was really greater, in that sense, than the epistle.<a name=475:15></a> It was a great achievement to bring in a thing like this.<a name=475:16></a> Paul remained longer in Ephesus than in any other place; he remained at Corinth for eighteen months, but his stay at Ephesus was longer.<a name=475:17></a> It helps immensely to understand the book to see these characteristics.<a name=475:18></a> It is not a simple record of occurrences; there are no repetitions in Scripture at all; the Spirit communicates certain facts in connection with each locality that represents certain aspects of the truth.<a name=475:19></a>

		J.T.<a name=475:22></a> Quite so; it is the development of the truth.<a name=475:23></a> So you have the door opened to the Gentiles in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10">Acts  10</a>; that is not repeated; and then you get the inner workings of a local Christian company at Antioch; that is not repeated; it is cited once; that is all you need.<a name=475:24></a> The circumstances recorded

		J.T.<a name=478:4></a> In chapter 17, the great point is the resurrection: it is recorded there that they said Paul was "a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection".<a name=478:5></a> He was emphasising the setting aside of all the pretension of man in the flesh.<a name=478:6></a> The Man by whom God is to judge the world is the Man whom He has raised from the dead.<a name=478:7></a> He says, "God hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead".<a name=478:8></a> His qualifications are in that direction; a Man raised from the dead.<a name=478:9></a> It is in view of that He commands all men everywhere to repent.<a name=478:10></a>

		I think it is easy to see from chapter 17, that the resurrection is the great basis.<a name=479:7></a> Peter emphasises it in his sermon at Jerusalem, but here, in the very heart of the Gentile world, Paul establishes the great principle that the earth is to be judged, and ruled, by a Man risen from the dead; "Whereof", he says, "he hath given assurance unto all men in that he hath raised him from the dead.<a name=479:8></a> And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked".<a name=479:9></a> The natural, cultivated man resents that; it means that he is to be removed; he is to be superseded.<a name=479:10></a> The Man who is raised from the dead is the approved Man.<a name=479:11></a>
