		J.T.<a name=1:2></a> I hope that these meetings may be used of the Lord to show the bearing of John's gospel as typical of conditions in Christendom at the present time.<a name=1:3></a> In order that the present application of this gospel may be clear to us, it may be noted that the things related generally took place in Judaea, which, because of its attitude toward Christ at that time, corresponds with the modern apostate religious world.<a name=1:4></a> The synoptic gospels generally engage us with occurrences in Galilee.<a name=1:5></a> Then none of the signs in John deals with demon possession, so we have not to do with these either, but with man's trained mind, active in denial of the truth.<a name=1:6></a> Moreover, the word used for works of power, as is well known, is "sign", not "miracle"; that is to say, the signs are not to call the congregation together, so to speak, like the bells of a church, as in the synoptic gospels, but to instruct the spiritual mind as to certain features of the Lord's service.<a name=1:7></a> I think the Lord would help in considering this sign as regards the manifestation of His glory.<a name=1:8></a> "This beginning of signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him".<a name=1:9></a> The Spirit would indicate to us that the 'signs' are to be read in that light.<a name=1:10></a> They are the manifestation of His glory, not of course in the sense in which He will be manifested presently in glory, but in the moral sense, to the end that those who are known as His disciples should believe; therefore, although the signs are for all, they are especially for those already disciples, as is said later, "That ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and

		Rem.<a name=2:2></a> There are a certain number of signs through the gospel, so it would help if you would enumerate them.<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:4></a> They are: The water made wine (chapter 2:1 - 12); the nobleman's son healed (chapter 4:46 - 54); the impotent man healed (chapter 5:1 - 16); the multitude fed (chapter 6:1 - 14); Christ walking on the water (chapter 6:15 - 21); the blind man's eyes opened (chapter 9); Lazarus raised (chapter 11); the voice from heaven (chapter 12:28 - 30); Christ's enemies falling to the ground when He said "I am" (chapter 18:6); His own resurrection (chapter 20); the condition of the grave clothes, the appearance of the angels, Christ's appearance to Mary, His coming in through closed doors to the disciples (all in chapter 20); finally His manifestation to Peter and those with him (chapter 21).<a name=2:5></a> The Lord's own resurrection is the greatest sign.<a name=2:6></a> The Jews asked, "What sign shewest thou to us, that thou doest these things?<a name=2:7></a>" Jesus answered, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up".<a name=2:8></a> "He spoke of the temple of his body".<a name=2:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:10></a> Are they cumulative and all leading up to a climax, so to speak?<a name=2:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:12></a> I think the climax is the appearance of Christ after He arose.<a name=2:13></a> That is the great end in view, to draw us into the spiritual realm where Christ is known as outside of what is material, coming through closed doors.<a name=2:14></a> The end of chapter 20 says, "Many other signs therefore also Jesus did before his disciples, which are not written in this book; but these are written that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life in his name", <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:30">John  20:30</a>,31.<a name=2:15></a> It is as if the writer intended us to consider specially the first twenty chapters.<a name=2:16></a> The great end in view is to draw us into the spiritual realm, the world in which Christ is

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:4></a> That would show, as already said, that the disciples were in view -- that <i>they</i>  might believe.<a name=3:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		H.E.<a name=3:6></a>S.<a name=3:7></a> Your thought is of the spiritual realm as seen in chapter 20.<a name=3:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:9></a> Yes, the spiritual realm is especially opened up in chapter 20, which of course we shall come to towards the end of our meetings.<a name=3:10></a> What is before us today is the manifestation of Christ's glory for faith, and it may help to compare this with the first reference to His glory in chapter 1.<a name=3:11></a> As become flesh His glory is contemplated by certain persons: it will help to compare those two features of His glory, <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:14">John  1:14</a> and <a href="../bible/John.htm#2:11">John  2:11</a>.<a name=3:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=3:13></a> How do you distinguish them, the contemplation of the glory and the manifestation?<a name=3:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:15></a> The first, as I understand it, is what I should refer to as private, seen by certain persons.<a name=3:16></a> It alludes to what was apprehended spiritually throughout the whole course of the Lord's sojourn here among His own.<a name=3:17></a> The writer of the Acts refers to the period "in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us, beginning from the baptism of John until the day in which he was taken up", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:21">Acts  1:21</a>,22.<a name=3:18></a> During that period I apprehend there were opportunities for discerning what was there, the relations between Himself and His Father -- a very wonderful suggestion.<a name=3:19></a> As become flesh He dwelt among us: "The Word became flesh and dwelt", or tabernacled, "among us", (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:14">John  1:14</a>) which I suppose alluded to provisional circumstances, that they were not final.<a name=3:20></a> His position then was not final or fixed, it was provisional, but such as would bring within our range results that are final, what He is with the Father.<a name=3:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=3:22></a> Is that His personal glory?<a name=3:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:24></a> Yes, His glory particularly as loved: "a glory as of an only-begotten with a father", <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:14">John  1:14</a>.<a name=3:25></a>

		G.W.<a name=4:1></a>W.<a name=4:2></a> You laid emphasis on the word 'tabernacled'.<a name=4:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:4></a> I thought it alluded to the transient, provisional position He had taken up.<a name=4:5></a> You see, it is <i>'with'</i>  or alongside the Father.<a name=4:6></a> It is not His service there, nor His activities mediatorially, but what He is with the Father.<a name=4:7></a> You want to think of Jesus according to all the lovableness and affection involved in such a relation: "an only-begotten with a father".<a name=4:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=4:9></a> I was wondering, that being so, whether "full of grace and truth" would bring in mediatorship?<a name=4:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:11></a> That is what they are intended to convey about Him.<a name=4:12></a> He was "full of grace and truth".<a name=4:13></a> They would be there, and that, I think, is the secret of the word 'sent' in John's gospel.<a name=4:14></a> It is that side of things; He is sent.<a name=4:15></a> He was there with the Father, full of all that was needed in His mediatorial service, and He came out thus.<a name=4:16></a> His personal position is alluded to, and what was seen there, not His activities.<a name=4:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=4:18></a> Would you distinguish between what is moral and what is personal?<a name=4:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:20></a> What they contemplated was personal.<a name=4:21></a> It was a question of a divine Person become flesh: "The Word became flesh, and dwelt among us", (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:14">John  1:14</a>) meaning that He was where they could see Him, but then He is not spoken of as <i>'with'</i>  them.<a name=4:22></a> He "dwelt among us" is general, but the point is.<a name=4:23></a> He was contemplated as "with a father".<a name=4:24></a> It is the secret really of understanding the economy of this gospel, that is to say, the Father and the Son.<a name=4:25></a> If we are to see the precious, blessed relations that existed and the glory of them, it is the glory as of an only one with a father.<a name=4:26></a> Any one contemplating that would understand the economy of John's gospel, which is that "the Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand", <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:35">John  3:35</a>.<a name=4:27></a> The contemplation of the relations between the Father and the Son is what gives lustre to everything.<a name=4:28></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:4></a> Yes; it is a relation well known among men, employed to indicate to us what was contemplated; that is to say, the peculiar glory of the relations between the Lord as Man here with the Father.<a name=5:5></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:10></a> Yes, indeed!<a name=5:11></a> The converse between them is very beautiful, pointing unmistakably to what we are now considering.<a name=5:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.C.<a name=5:13></a>G.<a name=5:14></a> How does the sentence in John's epistle fit in: "The eternal life, which was with the Father" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#1:2">1 John  1:2</a>)?<a name=5:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:16></a> It fits in exactly, but it is not there the Person that is in view, but the <i>thing</i>  that was in Him: "that eternal life".<a name=5:17></a> Some have assumed that that alluded to a past eternity, what He was in Deity, but it is not so at all.<a name=5:18></a> It refers to what He was as Man here.<a name=5:19></a> It is there eternal life is apprehended: "That which was from the beginning, that which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes; that which we contemplated, and our hands handled, concerning the word of life; (and the life has been manifested, and we have seen, and bear witness, and report to you the eternal life, which was with the Father, and has been manifested to us)" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#1:1">1 John  1:1</a>, 2).<a name=5:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:23></a> That is the idea.<a name=5:24></a> The tabernacling would mean that He moved about.<a name=5:25></a> We read of "all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:21">Acts  1:21</a>.<a name=5:26></a> They had thus opportunity of seeing in varied circumstances this beautiful thing that was discerned by some, this beautiful relation between the Father and the Son.<a name=5:27></a> It is said in Luke that "by day he was teaching in the temple, and by night, going out, he

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=6:4></a> What was quoted from the epistle has reference to incarnation and not to the past eternity.<a name=6:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:6></a> Obviously; it is a question of "that eternal life", which is Christ as Man, so that the first allusion to life in chapter 1 of the gospel is, "In him was life, and the life was the light of men" verse 4.<a name=6:7></a> It was in Him as Man that light shone.<a name=6:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=6:9></a> Is the thought that the life He lived here became the light of men?<a name=6:10></a> How could we know the Lord apart from the life He lived here?<a name=6:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:12></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:1">John  1:1</a> - 3 contemplates the Lord's eternal personality.<a name=6:13></a> He was in the beginning with God, and was God, and all things received being through Him.<a name=6:14></a> Nothing is said of light in these verses, but we have it in verse 4: "the life was the light of men".<a name=6:15></a> It is what was there in that connection, that is, the life was exclusively for men.<a name=6:16></a> It does not go beyond men, great and glorious as it is; it was not for angels, it is for men, and it shone in Him as a Man.<a name=6:17></a> It could not shine otherwise to be intelligible to us.<a name=6:18></a> Verses 4 - 13 form an epitome of Christ's presence in this world and its results.<a name=6:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.S.<a name=6:20></a>L.<a name=6:21></a> Verse 4 is one of those reciprocal expressions that can be put either way.<a name=6:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:23></a> The parts of the statement are of equal value, showing when you come to John's gospel that what shines is a tangible thing, that there is something substantial behind it.<a name=6:24></a> When God said, "Let there be light, and there was light", (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:3">Genesis  1:3</a>) we are not told what the light was; it is simply light, but in this gospel the light is the result of something substantial.<a name=6:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.S.<a name=6:26></a>L.<a name=6:27></a> Is it the light of the love of God: "The only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, <i>he</i>  hath declared him", verse 18?<a name=6:28></a> Is the light that is shining, the full revelation of God in Christ?<a name=6:29></a>

		<a name=7>[Page 7]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:1></a> I think verse 18 is greater than verse 4.<a name=7:2></a> The word 'revelation' is not there.<a name=7:3></a> "The only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him", <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:18">John  1:18</a>.<a name=7:4></a> The declaration of God goes beyond the light of life.<a name=7:5></a> We ought to distinguish between those two verses.<a name=7:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.S.<a name=7:7></a>L.<a name=7:8></a> I was thinking too of another verse: "The darkness is passing and the true light already shines" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:8">1 John  2:8</a>).<a name=7:9></a> What is that "true light"?<a name=7:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:11></a> It is the same idea carried forward in John's epistle, only in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:4">John  1:4</a> it is what shone in Christ, and in John's epistle it is what shines in the saints.<a name=7:12></a> That is, the light that shone into our souls becomes life in our souls and in turn shines as "true light" to others.<a name=7:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.S.<a name=7:14></a>L.<a name=7:15></a> How would you define the expression "true light"?<a name=7:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:17></a> Well, it is to expose the false things that were coming in.<a name=7:18></a> John's epistle is to show that the life was a tangible thing; it was not something abstract or theoretic, but tangible.<a name=7:19></a> It says in the first chapter, that which we have seen, heard, and handled concerning the word of life, but in chapter 2, it is in the saints.<a name=7:20></a> In measure, what it was in Him, it is in the saints.<a name=7:21></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=19:1></a> Our remarks this morning reached the idea of the temple; the Lord raising His body viewed in this way pointing to what comes out in the apostle Paul's ministry, both in its Corinthian and Ephesian aspects, not that the church is formally introduced, but the idea in the word translated temple is that the light of God is there.<a name=19:2></a> Chapters 1 and 2 form an introduction, showing how the truth of the gospel reaches on to the truth of the temple, in relation to which the whole scope of Scripture is apprehended, so that it says, "When therefore he was raised from among the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and believed the scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken", (<a href="../bible/John.htm#2:22">John  2:22</a>).<a name=19:3></a> Then chapters 3 and 4 present the truth radically, that is, new birth, dealing with the man from top to bottom; and chapter 4 dealing with the Spirit, not given in the highest intelligent order in which He works in us, but in relation to the lower affections; and the sign which we have read, connects with the idea of a believer's household.<a name=19:4></a> This doubtless has in view the spiritual house of chapter 8, where the thought of the house is introduced, without being formally stated to be the house of God.<a name=19:5></a> It is said in chapter 8 that the Son abides in it for ever, verse 35.<a name=19:6></a> We may be helped now by having in view that chapter 4 brings out the effect of the light on certain individuals so that they become sons of light, the woman in regard of her body and the nobleman in regard of his house.<a name=19:7></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=21:11></a> No doubt, but there is nothing to indicate any accommodation for the Lord as yet; it is said, "He abode <i>there</i>  two days".<a name=21:12></a> There may be reception of light and appreciation of Christ in an evangelical way as "the Saviour of the world", without suitable accommodation.<a name=21:13></a> Of course the Lord valued the desire of the Samaritans, but the setting of the believing household here is significant.<a name=21:14></a> The Lord is dealing with the truth in relation to man's whole moral being in chapter 3 and the body in chapter 4; so that the whole person is involved in the two chapters, and then we have a believing household.<a name=21:15></a> We cannot have a believing household save as we are dealt with radically, by getting to the root of things.<a name=21:16></a> Our being has to be dealt with in the new birth of chapter 3 and in the living water of chapter 4.<a name=21:17></a> The body is affected so that the woman becomes a son of light in this respect.<a name=21:18></a> It is said in chapter 12, "While ye have the light, believe in the light, that ye may become sons of light" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#12:36">John  12:36</a>).<a name=21:19></a> I think she becomes a son of light in regard of her body, and the nobleman becomes a son of light in regard of his house; but the body involves that it is a question of the person, whether one becomes a vessel of what is spiritual.<a name=21:20></a> The fact that the woman <i>left</i>  her waterpot indicates that

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=22:5></a> Well, we have the households of Chloe and Stephanas in Corinthians; they were reliable persons.<a name=22:6></a> In the household of Chloe it was shown that there was full sympathy as regards the conditions in the assembly at Corinth, so that what was discerned by those of that house was the state of division amongst the Corinthians, though they did not say anything about it in their letter to Paul -- nor was anything said about the wicked person in chapter 5.<a name=22:7></a> That chapter is based on a report, by whom we do not know, but chapter 1 speaks of the <i>showing</i>  of the division at Corinth, which is a most important matter.<a name=22:8></a> It was the real difficulty there, so that I have no doubt the idea of the nobleman's household in chapter 4 may be taken to represent what was at Corinth.<a name=22:9></a> In this respect the Lord had something for Himself there, and it linked on with Paul.<a name=22:10></a> The house in chapter 12 of this gospel is not named; but it was a house in which things could be done for Christ without much being said.<a name=22:11></a> A great affair took place as the Lord reached Bethany, but it was not marked by words.<a name=22:12></a> It was a place of silent spirituality, so that I think we may see the import in this way, of believing households.<a name=22:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=39:1></a> I would suggest that we consider this chapter in relation to the Lord's service in the public profession in modern times.<a name=39:2></a> This sign is not a sequel as the two earlier signs are; it is a new feature, and introduces the great subject of the Lord's relations with His Father in His public service.<a name=39:3></a> It is a unique chapter in the gospel, and serves as an occasion to consider the relations of the divine Persons in their operations.<a name=39:4></a> The scene of the service is Jerusalem, not as yet abandoned by God, but rather where there were still interventions of divine mercy.<a name=39:5></a> The intervention of Christ in this scene in this manifest way, making a man completely whole, serves to bring out what Christendom is in its public aspect and profession; and that the work of grace in relation to it, though perfectly done, may end in no moral issue or result for God.<a name=39:6></a> So divine Persons themselves are brought into evidence as acting of themselves and by themselves, not mediately but directly, as if to remind us that divine activities will go on to the end whatever happens.<a name=39:7></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is before me, dear brethren, to speak about the house -- the house of God, bearing in mind that the apostle in his first letter to Timothy specially speaks about it, and of the behaviour that is suitable in it, saying, that thou mayest "know how one ought to conduct oneself in God's house which is the assembly of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3:15">1 Timothy  3:15</a>).<a name=126:1></a> The order therefore is "the house", "the assembly", and "the pillar and base".<a name=126:2></a> The house involves enjoyment; it involves, of course, that in which God shows Himself in His affections, and in which His order is seen, but it is a place of holy, spiritual enjoyment.<a name=126:3></a> The house being said to be the assembly, conveys the idea of intelligent counsel and administrative action, resulting in public support for the truth, this latter involving conflict.<a name=126:4></a> I wish to confine my remarks to the house, as such, and in this respect I have also specially in mind the statement of king David as to his <i>affection</i>  for it.<a name=126:5></a> The word that one would bear in mind as to oneself, and one hopes that all will take notice of it, is the peculiar expression, "affection for the house of my God".<a name=126:6></a> Those of you who are conversant with 1 Chronicles will have noticed that David speaks in chapter 22 of preparing for the house in immense wealth out of his <i>affliction</i> ;whereas here in chapter 29 it is in his <i>affection</i>.<a name=126:7></a> The comparison of these two words in relation to the house, will help in the understanding of my remarks, for as combined, they present to us Christ, in His affliction and then in His affection.<a name=126:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before coming to Ephesians, I would remark that the gospels in their four different features present David and Solomon typically, and particularly Matthew, so that you find Christ in the exercise of His service, and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		indeed in His whole sojourn here, peculiarly in <i>houses</i>  in Matthew.<a name=127:1></a> He is indeed presented to us in that gospel, as in a house, in His childhood.<a name=127:2></a> Luke presents Him in a manger, but Matthew presents Him in a house, as sought out by the wise men of the East.<a name=127:3></a> We are told that the star "came and stood over the place where the little child was" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#2:9">Matthew  2:9</a>).<a name=127:4></a> The place is a larger idea than the house; indeed, that is confirmed in 1 Chronicles in chapter 21:25 where king David buys "the place" in which the house is to be.<a name=127:5></a> Now the wise men came to the place as guided by the star.<a name=127:6></a> It was the star of "the king of the Jews", Him they sought, showing how they were in accord with the mind of God, being free from national prejudice.<a name=127:7></a> No one can reach the house otherwise; so long as national prejudice is in our minds we shall never really reach the house.<a name=127:8></a> They came seeking "the king of the Jews", implying that they were to be subservient, that they were recognising the priority of the Jews.<a name=127:9></a> The Lord, indeed, insisted on this in talking to the woman at Sychar, and the Samaritans themselves later, had to learn that the Spirit should come through the apostles that were sent from Jerusalem.<a name=127:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the wise men came to the place under the guidance of heaven.<a name=127:11></a> They were deflected in going to Jerusalem, but finally the star directed them "to the place where the little child was" -- a very interesting and touching consideration -- but the star did no more than that.<a name=127:12></a> Being at the place, they entered into the house.<a name=127:13></a> I would suggest that there is something to be learnt in that, for many are content with the vicinity in which Christ may be, -- but <i>they</i>  entered into the house; they entered into the house where the little child was.<a name=127:14></a> He was under care; He was with the one who would care for Him best under God at that time, as is always so where the need of care exists.<a name=127:15></a> Where could care be found to equal that with the parent in the house, for God has provided in the house such care as all stages of His family require.<a name=127:16></a> That is how matters stand in
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=128>[Page 128]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Matthew: they entered into the house, and they find the child under care.<a name=128:1></a> They saw "the little child with his mother" and they worshipped.<a name=128:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So throughout Matthew we find the Lord signalising certain features of the truth as being "in the house", characteristically.<a name=128:3></a> To illustrate this, in chapter 13, He entered into a house, and His disciples followed Him.<a name=128:4></a> That is another thing.<a name=128:5></a> He takes up a position in the house, and persons who are followers understand, and they follow Him there.<a name=128:6></a> It becomes a place of exposition and of wonderful disclosures.<a name=128:7></a> No one can afford to miss these, the holy expositions of Scripture and of the parables and types in the house; and then the disclosures of hidden things, things that were in the Lord's heart, with regard to the assembly.<a name=128:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we find later (chapter 17) the Lord in the house, and Peter would have reduced Him to the level of an ordinary temple taxpayer.<a name=128:9></a> Unless we frequent the house in which He is, we shall have wrong thoughts of Him, and shall reduce Him in our thoughts, and words, and ways, to the level of ordinary persons, which the Holy Spirit greatly resents.<a name=128:10></a> So that Peter said, his Master certainly paid tribute.<a name=128:11></a> But as he came into the house the Lord anticipated him and adjusted him, and brought out the blessed fact that the position was that of sons.<a name=128:12></a> "Then are the sons free" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#17:26">Matthew  17:26</a>).<a name=128:13></a> Thus in that house the truth of sonship came out.<a name=128:14></a> And so throughout Matthew's gospel in which also and only there, you get the word 'householder' (chapter 13:52).<a name=128:15></a> All is to prepare us for the great leading thought, the assembly; that we might be in the world assemblywise.<a name=128:16></a> In order to be here in this way we must be in the good of, and enter into the spiritual buoyancy and enjoyment of the house.<a name=128:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So you find the Lord in the house of "Simon the leper", meaning that the public position may be one of reproach, but He is there nevertheless.<a name=128:18></a> Many would avoid being in that house; but if He takes up a position
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=129>[Page 129]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		subject to reproach and you avoid it because of that, you will miss the blessing attached to it.<a name=129:1></a> You find there the full appreciation of Christ's dignity and service; a woman anointed His head there.<a name=129:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then later in Matthew, the Lord sends His disciples, as they enquire where He would eat the passover, to a certain one.<a name=129:3></a> He says, "Go into the city to such an one" (chapter 26:18), saying nothing about the man with a pitcher of water, or the upper room, as in Mark or Luke, but simply sending them to convey to the man, that He would eat the passover in his house.<a name=129:4></a> The proposal indicated that the Lord would be free in that house, that He could eat the passover there with His disciples in liberty and dignity in the house -- not, in Matthew, in the upper room.<a name=129:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now all that bears on what I have in mind; it prepares us for Paul; indeed, all the evangelists stress the idea of the house.<a name=129:6></a> Luke presents it to us in the most attractive way, and I speak now to the young people, because Luke has a peculiar way of gauging the necessities of souls, and he knows that young people love enjoyment.<a name=129:7></a> The world knows it too, and strains every nerve to supply the need.<a name=129:8></a> So Luke presents the house in chapter 14 as that which is to be filled -- "that my house may be filled" (verse 23); but in chapter 15, as the place of enjoyment; figuratively the most delightful things are going on there -- "music and dancing"; what is presented in the way of music, what is spoken of in regard to Christ, is so delightful, is presented so perfectly, and with such charm, that everyone dances, everyone moves in response.<a name=129:9></a> The elder brother had no interest in it at all.<a name=129:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then John presents the house as the place in which the Son abides; the Son abides in the house for ever.<a name=129:11></a> He abides there.<a name=129:12></a> He abides in the house for ever; we shall never be without Him, and there we shall be truly free -- a very great fact, especially at the present time.<a name=129:13></a>

		Then John goes on later to tell us that the house was full of precious odour -- "the house", without saying whose house it was: "The house was filled with the odour of the ointment" (chapter 12:3).<a name=130:1></a> The sense of smell is delightfully ministered to in that house; there is nothing corrupt there.<a name=130:2></a> You will have noticed that the ointment which Mary used, was not in an alabaster box in John.<a name=130:3></a> The alabaster box would allude to the care with which the ointment was preserved from taint, but there is no need of that in John; it is to render tribute to Mary of Bethany, who loved our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption.<a name=130:4></a> That is what you will find in the house in which Jesus is ministered to.<a name=130:5></a>

		Now all these remarks will help us as to Ephesians, because Ephesians presents things in their fulness; not in a hard forced kind of way, but one thing growing out of another, and all coming out of a heart full, by the power of the Spirit.<a name=130:6></a> That is what marks Ephesians.<a name=130:7></a> The apostle's heart was simply full, and words are employed to denote the excessive excellency and greatness of the divine things presented.<a name=130:8></a> So Paul speaking about both Jew and gentile having access through Christ "by one Spirit to the Father", opens up his heart to these gentile believers, as indeed towards all.<a name=130:9></a> "No more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God".<a name=130:10></a> What a word for us!<a name=130:11></a> Some of us have been speaking about the blind man whose eyes were opened (<a href="../bible/John.htm#9">John  9</a>), that he was cast out -- a man without a country, without a family, without a religion; as we might say, even his parents undertaking nothing for him.<a name=130:12></a> What is he coming into?<a name=130:13></a> He is coming into all this of which I have been speaking.<a name=130:14></a> The Lord enquires of him, "dost thou believe on the Son of God?<a name=130:15></a>" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#9:35">John  9:35</a>).<a name=130:16></a> The Son of God will give him a country, a family, so that he is no longer a stranger and foreigner, but a "fellow-citizen of the saints, and of the household of God" -- marvellous statement!<a name=130:17></a>

		These Scriptures are familiar to most of us, if not to all, but what I have to advance on them may not be familiar.<a name=137:5></a> And so I ask the brethren to follow patiently as I seek to show that what I have read sets out fixed principles.<a name=137:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In moving about amongst brethren, I see the need of observing, recognising, and maintaining fixed principles, in a practical way.<a name=137:7></a> If we understand aright that there are such, corresponding in a way with what exists in the physical system, we shall see that the testimony will go on; for principles do not die with people, and although leaders, those whom we have loved and whose memories we cherish may go, the testimony will go on.<a name=137:8></a> It is right that young believers should regard their shepherds and teachers, and love and revere them; but then the Lord is pleased to call one and another to Himself, as He did Paul, Peter and many others, but the principles remain and will remain.<a name=137:9></a> They may at times be ignored, but in due course they will assert themselves; and it is well for young ones to become acquainted with them and to look for them as knowing them, and to regard all that militates against them as opposition to God.<a name=137:10></a> In this respect it is important for us to accustom ourselves to naming things.<a name=137:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Names of things usually arise from experience of them, acquaintance with them.<a name=137:12></a> The idea is brought in early, in that God brought the animals which He had created to Adam to see what he would call them.<a name=137:13></a> In like manner He would bring principles to our attention to see how we name them, and it is important that we
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=138>[Page 138]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		should give them right names.<a name=138:1></a> As an illustration, we have a fixed order of things after the deluge; it is stated that, while the earth remained certain things should continue, "seed-time and harvest, and cold and heat", and then we have the idea that I suggested in "summer and winter", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#8:22">Genesis  8:22</a>.<a name=138:2></a> That is to say, summer is a name given to heat by experience; so that we have something fixed and a name attached to it.<a name=138:3></a> Correspondingly, as we become accustomed to the principles that were introduced by the Lord and by His apostles, and which found scope at the outset and acquired a place in the hearts of believers and which they valued, we have things fixed and names attached to them.<a name=138:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first of these principles with which I propose to deal is in the first scripture that I read.<a name=138:5></a> There are many others throughout Scripture, but I speak of salient ones and the first is <i>faith</i>.<a name=138:6></a> I selected this verse out of many that speak of faith in this remarkable chapter, because the quality is introduced impersonally.<a name=138:7></a> That is to say, it is not attributed to any person or persons.<a name=138:8></a> Throughout the chapter you find it <i>is</i>  attributed to persons in a wonderful and constructive way, a way calculated to induce admiration in us as we look at what is called the "cloud of witnesses" surrounding us, and the intent is that we should admire and emulate and imitate, so as to "run with patience", as enjoined, "the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God", (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:1">Hebrews  12:1</a> - 2).<a name=138:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this verse 30, as I said, introduces faith in an impersonal way, which proves that the thing is established as known amongst the saints.<a name=138:10></a> It comes in after the passage of the Red Sea, as you will all notice -- an act of faith attributed to the children of Israel; it is the only one that is attributed to <i>them</i>,  they crossed the sea by faith.<a name=138:11></a> It is well that this is recorded, for it saves

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish to dwell on this particular point, because it is fundamental.<a name=139:7></a> Without faith we must be outside the divine realm in the state of our souls, for "he that cometh to God must believe that he is", (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:6">Hebrews  11:6</a>).<a name=139:8></a> Without faith we are outside the dispensation of God, which we are told "is in faith", (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#1:4">1 Timothy  1:4</a>), without it indeed we have no part or lot in the matter -- a most solemn position.<a name=139:9></a> There are those who pose among the people of God as having faith, like Simon Magus, but the testimony is that he had "neither part nor lot in this matter".<a name=139:10></a> (Acts 8:21), a very solemn thing to be said of anyone numbered among the people of God.<a name=139:11></a> To have a part is important, but to have a <i>lot</i>  is more important, a lot is fixed.<a name=139:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The testimony, as I said, is summarised in this verse, "By faith the walls of Jericho fell, having been encircled for seven days".<a name=139:13></a> I think it will appeal to you, that this encircling is the evidence of faith in these circumstances.<a name=139:14></a> If one has faith he must have part in the encircling, for the encircling of Jericho signifies that the world is overcome -- escape is impossible.<a name=139:15></a> "Who is he that gets the victory over the world, but he that believes that Jesus is the Son of God?<a name=139:16></a>" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:5">1 John  5:5</a>).<a name=139:17></a> One who believes that Jesus is the Son of God has part in the encircling.<a name=139:18></a> Now this encircling or encompassing for

		The idea of the day, as you will all remember, came in in Genesis 1, God having worked by the day -- a very touching suggestion.<a name=151:5></a> You will remember how Job cursed his day, as if others did not have to do with it, as if God did not work on that day, but He was working then as He is now every day.<a name=151:6></a> The Lord said, "My Father worketh hitherto"(<a href="../bible/John.htm#5:17">John  5:17</a>), not at certain times only, but always, for we cannot think of God being inactive in the presence of sin in this world.<a name=151:7></a> Job disregarded that fact as we are all likely to do in our narrowness and pettiness, but Job's folly could not interfere with God's activities.<a name=151:8></a>

		We have an allusion to His activities in grace in His word to Noah.<a name=151:9></a> He says, "My spirit shall not always plead with Man; for he indeed is flesh; but his days shall be a hundred and twenty years".<a name=151:10></a> <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#6:3">Genesis  6:3</a>.<a name=151:11></a> How full those days would be from God's side, every day of those hundred and twenty years; and with no result in the way of conversions as far as we know!<a name=151:12></a>

		There was <i>testimony</i>  -- an important matter.<a name=152:1></a> It was not simply the handing out of tracts and the like, but appeals and strivings every day.<a name=152:2></a> Man's thoughts were only evil every day, but that did not interfere with God's thoughts nor His activities.<a name=152:3></a> They were all God's days and He showed they were His days when striving with men in them, even although there was no result.<a name=152:4></a>

		Another idea of work on God's part is in Noah sending out the dove.<a name=152:5></a> He sent out a raven but it does not say he sent it out <i>from</i>  him, but he sent out the dove <i>from him</i>.<a name=152:6></a> It is a type of the Spirit, not now as striving, but under the emblem of a dove; well known to some of us, for the Spirit of God came down from heaven as a dove on the Lord Jesus.<a name=152:7></a> Matthew tells us the Lord saw the Spirit as a dove descending on Him, and Mark says the same, but John says that John the baptist saw the Spirit coming down as a dove, and Luke says that He came down in bodily shape as a dove, so that there should be no doubt as to what the dove means.<a name=152:8></a> But I speak of it now because of its relation to the day.<a name=152:9></a> The raven did not return to Noah; but the dove did return "to him".<a name=152:10></a> It came to him and he took it in "to him", such were the typically precious relations, as we may say, between the Father and the Spirit, between divine Persons.<a name=152:11></a> There was nothing about a day in the first sending out, but at the second sending out it reads "the dove came back at eventide"; that is to say, there was a day's work, but not a fruitless one, pointing to our own times.<a name=152:12></a> She brought back in her beak an olive-leaf plucked off, typical of life out of death.<a name=152:13></a> Death was still there, the waters had not quite dried up, but there was life as symbolised in the olive-leaf.<a name=152:14></a> That is our position as far as I understand.<a name=152:15></a> The Holy Spirit today is working by the day, bringing in these results for God, not a floating olive-leaf, but one plucked off, showing that it was connected with its source when the dove found it, and she brought it back at eventide; it was a fruitful day's work; it represented

		In keeping with all that, I want to show from <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#28">Numbers  28</a>how God looks for this very thing in the continual burnt-offering.<a name=153:3></a> He provides food for us in abundance, and these chapters -- 28 and 29 -- which run together, deal with what he expects -- daily, and weekly, and monthly, and yearly.<a name=153:4></a> That is how the matter stands.<a name=153:5></a> The last great offering is the feast of tabernacles, which diminishes in the number of bullocks from thirteen down to seven, but not below that.<a name=153:6></a> That is to say, the millennial state of things implies that God will have His portion although it may diminish.<a name=153:7></a> It is a sorrowful thing to have to admit diminution in our givings God-ward, but God bears with it provided it does not go below the spiritual thought of seven, provided it does not go below what is the outcome of perfect exercise.<a name=153:8></a> All above that is excess which God delights in, but I am speaking only of the daily, because if the daily experience be not maintained, the weekly will drop, and the monthly will drop, and the yearly will drop, and in all probability we shall lose our mornings, we shall become darkened.<a name=153:9></a> As Peter says, "But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins", 2 Peter 1:9.<a name=153:10></a> It was because of that very thing, not attending to the daily sacrifices.<a name=153:11></a>

		So we have a yearling lamb, a beautiful type of Christ.<a name=153:12></a> A yearling lamb is not just a little lamb.<a name=153:13></a> There are two words for "lamb" in the New Testament, the one indicating a full-grown creature, and the other a tiny thought.<a name=153:14></a> It is the former that is in view in the yearling, so that God's offerings contemplate maturity and not infancy.<a name=153:15></a> Scripture makes provision for infancy, for God takes care of the infants; the Lord Jesus took infants into His arms, but you can hardly expect an infant to make a daily offering; it has to be cared for.<a name=153:16></a>

		Now, dear brethren, this is intensely practical, because unless we attend to it our special convocations must be impoverished and God denied His part.<a name=154:2></a> "Will a man rob God?<a name=154:3></a>" it says in Malachi, which is, as you might say, the evening book of the Old Testament.<a name=154:4></a> It is a challenge.<a name=154:5></a> It is a sorrowful thing to be classified with robbers.<a name=154:6></a> "Will a man rob God?<a name=154:7></a>" "Wherein do we rob thee?<a name=154:8></a>" "In tithes and heave-offerings", (<a href="../bible/Malachi.htm#3:8">Malachi  3:8</a>) is the answer.<a name=154:9></a> We do not want to be classified thus.<a name=154:10></a> To meet that situation God urges them to bring the tithes into the treasure house and He would open the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing that they could not contain.<a name=154:11></a> It is contingent on bringing the tithes, so that we may not be found robbers of God.<a name=154:12></a> We may not think of it as serious, but it is equally serious to robbing men, for God has rights, and His rights surely come first.<a name=154:13></a> So that the morning lamb denotes how we begin the day.<a name=154:14></a> I desire to be simple, because what I have in mind is that we should be filled with the Spirit, and that this should be maintained, and if it be maintained, the evening lamb will be equal to the morning lamb.<a name=154:15></a> As I said, God requires a yearling lamb, with a meat-offering mingled with beaten oil, and in addition to that a drink-offering.<a name=154:16></a> The word "strong drink" is found in this passage.<a name=154:17></a> How do I begin my day therefore?<a name=154:18></a> What have I, to speak reverently, to stimulate the heart of God?<a name=154:19></a> This is what is meant by strong drink.<a name=154:20></a> It was not for man; it was for God, and it was to be poured out in the sanctuary.<a name=154:21></a> If we go back to <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#25:29">Exodus  25:29</a>, we will find that the table was furnished with vessels with which to pour out.<a name=154:22></a> The believer has something for God in the morning; he has his lamb and what accompanies it, denoting that he is appreciating the Lord Jesus.<a name=154:23></a>

		You will remember that Moses as having been in the mount with God, coming down with the tables of the covenant in his hands, finds the people already given up to idolatry, and he casts the tables down and breaks them.<a name=163:4></a> But God never gave up His thought as to the tabernacle as shown in the pattern, neither did Moses, but before it can be set up the most painful experiences had to be gone through in the camp.<a name=163:5></a> Moses cried, "Who is on the Lord's side?<a name=163:6></a>" "And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.<a name=163:7></a> And he said unto them.<a name=163:8></a> Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side", (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#32:26">Exodus  32:26</a> - 27).<a name=163:9></a> And the levites went through the camp with the sword, and three thousand were slain.<a name=163:10></a> After this Moses takes the tent and pitches it outside the camp, and it becomes a question for all who are on the Lord's side, of going out to Him there.<a name=163:11></a>

		In chapter 12 of Romans and in verse 2 the apostle entreats believers not to be "conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind".<a name=165:8></a> If this world is before the heart, and a man desires to shine in it, he is not in a position to prove the will of God.<a name=165:9></a> The world has its ideals, it makes its appeal, and so the apostle warns us here, "be not conformed to this world".<a name=165:10></a> We are told elsewhere that the world "that then was" -- in the days of Noah -- perished, being overflowed of water; and again, there is the world that is now which is reserved unto fire awaiting the judgment; but then there is the world which is to come -- "that world", as the Lord calls it -- and in view of our part in it we must be "transformed by the renewing of the mind".<a name=165:11></a> This goes further than a resolve of mind to serve the law of God (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7:25">Romans  7:25</a>); this verse serves to assist us as to the use of our minds; and here in regard to them we have this significant word "renewal".<a name=165:12></a> This word expresses what is common to this epistle, for we have the same idea in "newness of life" and "newness of spirit" -- it means an entirely

	<div class="paragraph">
		This is to be understood spiritually; so we read in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:12">1 Corinthians  2:12</a>, "We have received .<a name=166:3></a>.<a name=166:4></a>.<a name=166:5></a> the Spirit which is of God, that we may know the things which have been freely given to us of God".<a name=166:6></a> Believers have the Holy Spirit, who instructs us in regard to all things.<a name=166:7></a> In <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#28">Isaiah  28</a>, we read of the farmer, that "his God doth instruct him" -- If God will thus instruct a farmer in his work, will He not instruct us as to the renewing of the mind?<a name=166:8></a> Let us therefore ask the Lord for this knowledge: speak to Him about this renewing of the mind, and He will show us what He means by it: indeed we are told that the Lord will give us understanding in <i>all</i>  things.<a name=166:9></a> This renewing relates to another world -- it is looking on to the world in which Christ is everything and which had its conception before the foundation of this world.<a name=166:10></a>

		When Moses came down from the mount and had broken the first tables, and after all the painful process of dealing with the camp had been gone through, he entreats to be allowed to see God's glory and God accedes to his wish in the most tender gracious way.<a name=167:8></a> He says, "I will do this thing also that thou hast said"(<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#33:17">Exodus  33:17</a>), and from this point Moses becomes more expressly typical of Christ as the Mediator -- more like Jesus.<a name=167:9></a> God has taught him more of Himself, and so He directs him to go up to the mountain again; and the terms on which Moses is to be there show that he is more than ever pleasing to God, as more like that One of whom God can say, "Thou art my beloved Son in whom I have found my delight"(<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#1:11">Mark  1:11</a>).<a name=167:10></a> So here He says to Moses, <i>You</i>  make the tables -- "Hew for thyself two tables of stone like the first",(<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#34:1">Exodus  34:1</a>) -- and bring them up in your own hands, and Deuteronomy adds a further word, that he

		In order to amplify what I am saying, I would refer to Paul's list of those to whom the Lord appeared after He arose; and I would direct your view, beloved, to the forty days of the Lord's sojourn here after He arose.<a name=172:4></a> It is inscrutable, but full of spiritual instruction.<a name=172:5></a> Unless we understand something of those days, we are scarcely equal to the assembly or to its privileges.<a name=172:6></a> The apostle, in bringing forward this list, was endeavouring to allure the Corinthians on to spiritual lines; and that is what I have in mind, dear brethren, that there is a spiritual realm -- a realm of visions and revelations.<a name=172:7></a> The Lord "appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.<a name=172:8></a> Then he appeared to about five hundred brethren at once, .<a name=172:9></a>.<a name=172:10></a>.<a name=172:11></a> Then he appeared to James; then to all the apostles; and last of all, as to an abortion, he appeared to me also", (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:5">1 Corinthians  15:5</a> - 9).<a name=172:12></a> And then with what beautiful humility he speaks!<a name=172:13></a> "For <i>I</i>  am the least of the apostles, who am not fit to be called apostle", verse 9.<a name=172:14></a> That would never be my judgment of him; but <i>he</i>  said it, and this sets before us a truly humble person.<a name=172:15></a> He said, "<i>I</i>  am the least of the apostles"; and not only does he say this, but also, I am "less than the least of all saints", (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:8">Ephesians  3:8</a>).<a name=172:16></a> This corresponds with <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16">Psalm  16</a>, in which our Lord in spirit expresses His lowly mind here: "My goodness extendeth not to thee", verse 2.<a name=172:17></a> We bow as marvelling at such words, but He uttered them, and they are surely intended to imbue our minds with the humility seen in the service and testimony of our Lord.<a name=172:18></a> The Lord Jesus said further, "To the saints that are on the earth, and to the excellent thou hast said.<a name=172:19></a> In them is all my delight"(<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16:3">Psalm  16:3</a>),

		I go on to the passage which records this appearing in his own words -- in the apostle's speech before Agrippa and Festus in Caesarea.<a name=173:2></a> It is in the presence of "great pomp"; for we are told that the king, Bernice, Festus and the great ones of Caesarea were there.<a name=173:3></a> How wretched that show of worldly glory must have been to Paul!<a name=173:4></a> Not that he despised official dignity, for he addressed them with respect -- "most noble Festus", and "king Agrippa".<a name=173:5></a> That is an important matter too, for the powers that be are ordained of God; but mere worldly show was nothing to Paul.<a name=173:6></a> His eyes had seen the King, the Lord of hosts, and one view of that glory dissipates all this world's glory.<a name=173:7></a> And that is what the Lord would bring us to, dear brethren -- to view the glory of this world, as Paul did.<a name=173:8></a> The Lord would bring us down; in fact, He is doing it now through reduction in our circumstances -- little by little; but this makes for inward expansion; and the Lord would take us aside and give us a view of His glory.<a name=173:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I hope I shall be able to speak briefly and concisely, having in mind to show that the Lord Jesus always reserves to Himself the mastery of every set of circumstances in which the testimony may be, or in which His people may be, and shows that in crises it is not simply that He comes in for deliverance -- He does, but it is not simply that; He shows also that He has a positive end in view in what happens; blessing is always in view in what He does.<a name=192:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will observe here that the passage begins with a suggestion of a <i>manifestation</i>,  not simply an intervention.<a name=192:2></a> If we get the thought of a manifestation of Christ into our souls, we shall think it worth while to go through certain exercises and processes and sufferings, so that it may be a verity to us.<a name=192:3></a> How great is a manifestation of Jesus!<a name=192:4></a> A manifestation is not simply that one passes before you; but it is intentional.<a name=192:5></a> In Canticles the Lord is presented as showing Himself by certain movements that would make Him attractive, "shewing himself through the lattice"(<a href="../bible/SongofSongs.htm#2:9">Song of Songs  2:9</a>), behind which was His lover, but whose love was somewhat cold and uncertain.<a name=192:6></a> There was a movement to attract her attention so that she might move from where she was and come to Him.<a name=192:7></a> The Lord shows Himself through the lattice, that is in spite of something that is between your soul and Him.<a name=192:8></a> Very easily we allow some such thing, but in spite of it He would manifest Himself to us.<a name=192:9></a>

		The third cry I wish to speak of is in <a href="../bible/John.htm#7">John  7</a>.<a name=209:5></a> Without what is involved in this cry, the others must be unintelligible to us.<a name=209:6></a> We must have the Holy Spirit.<a name=209:7></a> There is hardly any truth less understood, or less accepted practically, than the truth of the Spirit of God as present here now.<a name=209:8></a> That is what this chapter deals with, and it says "the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified", <a href="../bible/John.htm#7:39">John  7:39</a>.<a name=209:9></a> It refers to the wonderful day of the Spirit here on earth.<a name=209:10></a> Did that not occasion feeling?<a name=209:11></a> Yes!<a name=209:12></a> He looked forward to that day, the like of which never had existed, and I may add, never will again exist; for the millennium is not equal to this.<a name=209:13></a> The Holy Spirit will not be here then, as He is now.<a name=209:14></a> This is a peculiar time, and it is a matter of deep feeling to Jesus.<a name=209:15></a> Is it this to us?<a name=209:16></a> The Lord would raise the question with us, as to whether we have the Holy Spirit?<a name=209:17></a> as to whether any of us thirsts?<a name=209:18></a> There is a great deal of thirst.<a name=209:19></a> So that in the last day of the feast -- the great day -- it is very evident there was thirst.<a name=209:20></a> The Lord knew it.<a name=209:21></a> On the last day, the greatest day.<a name=209:22></a> He stood and cried.<a name=209:23></a> How He felt the need!<a name=209:24></a> -- as He saw the Jews from all parts of Palestine, and the provinces of the Empire, congregated there to celebrate the feast of tabernacles.<a name=209:25></a> It was a feast that was intended by God to be the expression of love for brethren, dwelling in nearness to one another in booths.<a name=209:26></a> It is a question of being near one another.<a name=209:27></a> There was nothing there then of this holy joy of dwelling together in divine love, and the Lord knew it.<a name=209:28></a> He saw the thirst that was there -- it prevailed about Jerusalem that day, as it prevails about this city today; but the Lord is inviting: "If any one thirst, let him come to me and drink", chapter 7:37.<a name=209:29></a> With a feeling voice.<a name=209:30></a> He invited His hearers to

		Let us not think that these things are in the distance, that these people are dead and gone, Jerusalem having been laid in ruins for centuries.<a name=210:2></a> The invitation is the same today -- Jesus cries and says to us, "If any one thirst, let him come to me and drink" <a href="../bible/John.htm#7:37">John  7:37</a>.<a name=210:3></a> He gives the living water.<a name=210:4></a> He fills the unsatisfied hearts of men in this world; and He would have us join with Him in it, as having drunk ourselves.<a name=210:5></a> We shall never be evangelical unless we have sympathetic hearts.<a name=210:6></a> And then the passage goes on to speak of the magnitude of the thing -- that it should be in the belly of the believer, flowing out as rivers of living water, verse 38.<a name=210:7></a> A wonderful thought!<a name=210:8></a> No one, who has not the Spirit, can understand it.<a name=210:9></a> The magnificence of the thing is stressed -- rivers of living water flowing out of a believer in Christ.<a name=210:10></a> Then it adds: "But this he said concerning the Spirit, which they that believed on him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified", verse 39.<a name=210:11></a> Well, that is the third cry.<a name=210:12></a> It is regarding the Holy Spirit, without whom all that goes into the first two must be a dead letter to us; because it is only by the Spirit of God that we enter into these things.<a name=210:13></a> Christian knowledge is only by the Spirit of God.<a name=210:14></a> Mere 'theology' is truth made to fit into man's mind; and so, however well meant, it cannot rightly convey divine thoughts.<a name=210:15></a> "For who of men hath known the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him?<a name=210:16></a> thus also the things of God knows no one except the Spirit of God", (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:11">1 Corinthians  2:11</a>).<a name=210:17></a>

		Then in chapter 12, where the public testimony is over -- the testimony to the Jews -- the Lord cites from <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#53">Isaiah  53</a>"who has believed our report", verse 38, and then He says, "On this account .<a name=211:9></a>.<a name=211:10></a>.<a name=211:11></a> Esaias said again.<a name=211:12></a> He has blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart", verses 39 - 40.<a name=211:13></a> After that, the Lord cries and says: "He that believes on me, believes not on me, but on him that sent me; and he that beholds me, beholds him that sent me", verses 44,45.<a name=211:14></a> It is to bring out the greatness of the testimony.<a name=211:15></a> What are people rejecting?<a name=211:16></a> They are rejecting God!<a name=211:17></a> "He .<a name=211:18></a>.<a name=211:19></a>.<a name=211:20></a> that beholds me, beholds him that sent me", <a href="../bible/John.htm#12:44">John  12:44</a>,45.<a name=211:21></a> He is no less than God.<a name=211:22></a> He is divine, and the Father was there in Him doing the works.<a name=211:23></a> It is wonderful how the holy Trinity is combined in the operations of Jesus.<a name=211:24></a> By the Spirit, He cast out demons, and as He said, "the Father who abides in me, he does the works", <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:10">John  14:10</a>.<a name=211:25></a> It is a perfect unity.<a name=211:26></a> He says.<a name=211:27></a> What are you rejecting?<a name=211:28></a> What you are rejecting is God Himself.<a name=211:29></a> "He that believes on me believes .<a name=211:30></a>.<a name=211:31></a>.<a name=211:32></a> on him that sent me; and he that beholds me, beholds him that sent me", (<a href="../bible/John.htm#12:44">John  12:44</a>); and He closes the chapter by saying that the Father's <i>commandment</i>  is life everlasting.<a name=211:33></a> God in grace is <i>commanding</i>  the great blessing of eternal life, and men are rejecting it!<a name=211:34></a>

		THE DIVINE CIRCLE

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#3:34">Mark  3:34</a> - 35; <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#7:15">1 Samuel  7:15</a> - 17; <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#14:19">Acts  14:19</a> - 20
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I was thinking, dear brethren, of the idea of a <i>circle</i>.<a name=213:1></a> As employed in Scripture it has a spiritual significance.<a name=213:2></a> It has a great place in scientific matters, and rightly; for it marks, to a very large extent, the physical creation and it has also a place in spiritual things.<a name=213:3></a> Scripture alludes to it in this way, but with spiritual intent.<a name=213:4></a> It involves a centre, whether this be theoretical or actual, also influence according to the proportion given by the God of measure.<a name=213:5></a> So that if we regard Christ as the centre, the circumference must be proportionate, the idea of "the God of measure" entering into His position, so that the circumference of that which is influenced by Christ is commensurate with His Person.<a name=213:6></a> It must be; and when we apply this to persons we can see at once how inclusive this influence is; and, I may say exclusive, for there is the idea of throwing off matter in the creation, and certainly in what is moral there is the idea of throwing off by influence what is extraneous.<a name=213:7></a> There is also the idea of holding what is according to Himself; as He says, "I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me", <a href="../bible/John.htm#12:32">John  12:32</a>.<a name=213:8></a> Nothing foreign is drawn: only what is according to Himself.<a name=213:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So, to apply what I have remarked to <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#3">Mark  3</a>, the meaning is obvious, and applies widely, and also in detail to a meeting like the present.<a name=213:10></a> However general and wide spiritual thoughts may be in their bearing, they have always a local application; and the application of <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#3">Mark  3</a>to a meeting like this is, I believe, obvious and encouraging.<a name=213:11></a> The chapter contemplates the crisis in the Lord's ministry.<a name=213:12></a> The great good that was being done, which was undeniable, was attributed to Beelzebub.<a name=213:13></a> Such is the capability of the religious mind when
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=214>[Page 214]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		tested by Christ: such are the extremes to which it will go.<a name=214:1></a> Think, dear brethren, of what it was to heaven that such a thing should be alleged against Jesus!<a name=214:2></a> The Lord deals with the charge as a word spoken against the Holy Spirit.<a name=214:3></a> It was against Him, but He regards it as against the Holy Spirit, for which He says there is no forgiveness.<a name=214:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The line is thus drawn between Christ and the world in the sharpest manner, and it remains so drawn; there is really no change.<a name=214:5></a> Even His relatives, whilst not going so far as to attribute the power of Beelzebub to Christ in His work, said that He was out of His mind -- a most cutting thing!<a name=214:6></a> The allegation that persons are out of their mind is not uncommon; a similar charge was made at Pentecost, and it was reiterated by Festus at Caesarea against Paul: "much learning doth make thee mad", he said.<a name=214:7></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#26:24">Acts  26:24</a>.<a name=214:8></a> So that the brethren of Christ according to the flesh were not far away from those who alleged that the power of Beelzebub was operating in Him.<a name=214:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We do well to take account of our surroundings, and to see whether -- though we may shelter ourselves under moderation -- we are allied against Christ, although assuming to be His brethren, "his relatives", (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#3:21">Mark  3:21</a>).<a name=214:10></a> The difference is not very great, dear brethren: it is just gradation of opposition.<a name=214:11></a> <i>It is opposition</i>.<a name=214:12></a> Whether we really join with those who say the Lord or His followers are out of their minds, or whether we say that they are actuated by the power of the devil, we are in bad company, however moderate we may claim to be.<a name=214:13></a> Indeed, latitudinarianism is one of the worst things: it is a subtle thing.<a name=214:14></a> It is a leaven that is destructive; God abhors it.<a name=214:15></a> We are either for Christ or against Him.<a name=214:16></a> So when His mother and His brethren came and stood without, asking to see Him, He has a cool answer for them; He makes no move towards them.<a name=214:17></a> Let no one assume that his mere apparent moderation commends him!<a name=214:18></a> It is a question of the <i>side</i>  you are on.<a name=214:19></a>

		Happily, at the moment, there was a crowd sitting around Him.<a name=215:2></a> It was no accident; it fitted exactly with what was required.<a name=215:3></a> There was a concrete expression of what was in the Lord's mind as replacing the opposition, as replacing the system that had come under the power of the enemy.<a name=215:4></a> The crowd was sitting around <i>Him</i>.<a name=215:5></a> This circumstance was divinely ordered.<a name=215:6></a> So the Spirit of God records with emphasis the idea of a circle; it says that the Lord looked "around <i>in a circuit</i>  at those that were sitting around him" -- as the passage in <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#3">Mark  3</a>should be translated.<a name=215:7></a> You say, 'They were inactive.<a name=215:8></a> Why were they not active?<a name=215:9></a> There was plenty to be done'.<a name=215:10></a> But the most important thing, beloved brethren, is to sit around Jesus with listening ears and understanding hearts.<a name=215:11></a> As He said elsewhere: "This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom <i>he</i>  hath sent", <a href="../bible/John.htm#6:29">John  6:29</a>.<a name=215:12></a> Him whom the Father had sanctified and sent into the world.<a name=215:13></a> The will of God entered into that.<a name=215:14></a> The greatest activity, and the greatest sacrifice, are of no value at all apart from this.<a name=215:15></a> So that He looked round in a circuit at those who were sitting around Him and said, "Behold .<a name=215:16></a>.<a name=215:17></a>.<a name=215:18></a> my brethren!<a name=215:19></a>" How precious it is to have the Lord so regard any of us, or all of us!<a name=215:20></a> And then He gives His reason, saying, "for whosoever shall do the will of God the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother".<a name=215:21></a> There was moral history behind this: those sitting around are not merely curious; they are <i>doing the will of God</i>.<a name=215:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		John supplies the secret; he tells us that Jesus said, "No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him", (<a href="../bible/John.htm#6:44">John  6:44</a>).<a name=215:23></a> The drawing power was there; and that works out in the doing of the will of God.<a name=215:24></a> Matthew in the same connection says, "the will of my Father who is in the heavens" chapter 12:50, shutting out all modernism, branding as contrary to God all that is marked by the will of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So that, dear brethren, you can see how pleased the Lord is with those who sit around as at meetings of the saints.<a name=216:5></a> The word "crowd" is used, for it is not a question of assembly order, but of a number of persons, not in disorder, surely, but simply marked as sitting around Jesus.<a name=216:6></a> He is delighted with that.<a name=216:7></a> One is greatly encouraged in the increasing number of these gatherings, and the attention -- they are pleasing to heaven.<a name=216:8></a> The Lord has in them a concrete example of the mind of heaven, which is no small matter; for one great principle in Scripture is the exemplification of divine ideas, and the meetings I refer to are the exemplification of a great principle set out on the mount of transfiguration: "This is my beloved Son; <i>hear him</i>", (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#9:7">Mark  9:7</a>).<a name=216:9></a> In this passage in <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#3">Mark  3</a>it is a question of "sitting <i>around him</i>", a position of quietness and restfulness.<a name=216:10></a> He being the centre for all.<a name=216:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To proceed to Samuel: I want to show that the idea of a circuit involves the Lord's actual movements, following the assertion that Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life; that is to say, there will be no relaxing of the Lord's service as Judge during this dispensation, whatever men may do; however loud and blatant modern communism may be, the Lord Jesus will judge for His people during the whole period; and that is a great comfort to every subject person.<a name=216:12></a> It is in keeping with His position as seen in Matthew, where in chapter 28, verse 20, He says, "I am with you all the days, until the completion of the age" -- every day!<a name=216:13></a> How we prove it, dear brethren!<a name=216:14></a> But then He moves about in judgment -- not in punitive judgment; that is not the point in Samuel's ministry, although the basis of such judgment was there.<a name=216:15></a> God will judge according to the

		judgment arrived at by His saints, as we learn in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#18:20">Revelation  18:20</a>: "God has judged your judgment upon her".<a name=217:1></a> In these visits of our Lord, typified in Samuel, we learn how to judge with discrimination; a very important matter, because we all admit our great poverty in the way of judicial discrimination.<a name=217:2></a> It was lacking at Corinth; it is always lacking in unspiritual conditions.<a name=217:3></a> There is inability to judge, and so we often call evil good, and good evil.<a name=217:4></a> There is much of that kind of thing, but that is not the kind of judgment you would get at Bethel and Gilgal and Mizpah and Ramah in the days of Samuel; it is not the kind of judgment you will get where the Lord Jesus is in the midst of the "two or three" gathered to His name.<a name=217:5></a> You get righteous judgment where He is; as He says in the presence of the Jews: "Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment", <a href="../bible/John.htm#7:24">John  7:24</a>.<a name=217:6></a>

		According to <a href="../bible/John.htm#18">John  18</a>, in the presence of the high priest Christ was smitten on the cheek; another than "the Judge of Israel" was on the judgment seat, and he called good evil, and evil good.<a name=217:7></a> We are come "to God", we are told, "the judge of all", (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:23">Hebrews  12:23</a>), and we are to learn how to judge from Him.<a name=217:8></a> That judgment is put into the hands of the Son of man; all judgment is in His hands, meaning, as I apprehend, that it is carried out in sympathy.<a name=217:9></a> We read of the vintage being <i>fully ripe</i>  before the judgment is executed in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#14:18">Revelation  14:18</a>, meaning that God is <i>slow</i>  to wrath, slow to execute punitive judgment; but then He is not slow to bring out the facts; there should be no delay in the bringing out of the facts of any matter requiring judgment.<a name=217:10></a> Let them stand, and have their voice before action is taken!<a name=217:11></a> So the Lord, as typified in Samuel, judges in Bethel.<a name=217:12></a> I am speaking now of a passage well known to most of us; but it is important at the present moment.<a name=217:13></a> If the Lord moves around, so to speak, and judges at Bethel, it refers to His judicial service in relation to the <i>house of God</i>.<a name=217:14></a> The truth of

		In the animal realm as well as in the vegetable, we have freshness -- <i>in young</i>  creatures constantly coming in; and so, as applied to the believer in a spiritual sense, it is to mark him at the beginning; the flesh of the believer, however worn out in its natural relations, becomes fresh as a child, and the divine intent is that it should not be otherwise, but that it should continue fresh.<a name=225:7></a>

		I stress this, because of the importance of teaching, not only as to what is essentially right, but what is right in form.<a name=237:11></a> Indeed, it was said approvingly of believers in the days of the apostles that "they persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles", (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:42">Acts  2:42</a>).<a name=237:12></a> There was an authority that was not to be questioned in the apostles' doctrine, and they persevered in it.<a name=237:13></a> The use of the word "persevered" would indicate what great opposition there was, for the Sadducees, Pharisees, and learned men, would seek to turn the disciples away from what the apostles taught -- but there was perseverance in it; and there is need of perseverance today, so that the teaching may be preserved as it has been delivered to us.<a name=237:14></a>

		These scriptures treat of "the man" and "the woman", and that is why I have read them, wishing to show the relative positions and functions of the sexes in the assembly; and not only to apply these scriptures in a literal sense, but also to enlarge a little on what is conveyed spiritually in the man and in the woman respectively.<a name=247:1></a> The first scripture is selected from a chapter which treats somewhat fully of the relative positions of the man and the woman, and it is not without signification that the chapter also introduces and develops the assembly in the exercise of its functions in a locality, which, rightly understood, makes room for Christ as the full representation of the man, as the assembly is the full representation of the woman; and makes room also for the universal position of the assembly as the one great thought and idea and object of Christ in the current dispensation.<a name=247:2></a> That is to say, the chapter in introducing the Lord's supper prefaces it by instruction that leads on to the apprehension of the Lord Jesus as Head of the assembly.<a name=247:3></a>

		From these remarks you will see why I read the two verses in the first scripture, which say, "For man is not of woman, but woman of man.<a name=249:5></a> For also man was not created for the sake of the woman, but woman for the sake of the man".<a name=249:6></a> But then, it goes on, "However, neither is woman without man, nor man without woman, in the Lord.<a name=249:7></a> For as the woman is of the man, so also is the man by the woman, but all things of God".<a name=249:8></a> So that we have set out in the chapter a beautiful order of things.<a name=249:9></a> God is regarded as the supreme Head, an appellation first ascribed to Him by David.<a name=249:10></a> David says, "Jehovah .<a name=249:11></a>.<a name=249:12></a>.<a name=249:13></a> thou art exalted as Head above all", <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#29:11">1 Chronicles  29:11</a>.<a name=249:14></a> It awaited the Lord Jesus to come in to set out this wonderful truth, for in Him, in Jesus, it is not only that He said things, but He exemplified them.<a name=249:15></a> One who contents himself with merely saying things will never be a model: if I <i>show</i>  a thing, it is established in the mind.<a name=249:16></a> The Lord Jesus set out this great principle of God-Headship, as I might call it, in His life here -- "The head of Christ is God", and "Christ is the head of every man, but woman's head is the man", "but all things of God".<a name=249:17></a> There is a beautiful position set out for us in the passage, which is to be seen in every phase of life, in the household, and everywhere; wherever men and women are together according to God, this great truth will be seen, and God is pleased and glorified in it.<a name=249:18></a> If there is one thing one cherishes more than another, it is to afford a little bit of pleasure for God.<a name=249:19></a> In the life of Jesus it was

		I wish now to show how it is worked out in a man and his wife, for scripture affords us concrete examples of its teaching.<a name=250:4></a> As I said, things are not only told to us, but <i>shown</i>  to us.<a name=250:5></a> Here we have it in a man and his wife, Aquila and Priscilla: this couple has a unique place in scripture in several respects, but in particular, that they are never mentioned apart, they are always seen together.<a name=250:6></a> I need not say that there is <i>some</i>  suggestion of Christ and the assembly in that: were we to understand the position we should see that Christ, normally being its Head is always seen in relation to the assembly.<a name=250:7></a> Of course He has His place and glories as in the Deity in which the creature can have no part, but as Man in heaven, having effected redemption, the assembly is His body, His wife indeed, and in this sense He and she are inseparable.<a name=250:8></a> This marks the present time and gives a special character to the dispensation.<a name=250:9></a> In the future too it will appear.<a name=250:10></a> Aquila and Priscilla are mentioned six times, always together.<a name=250:11></a> The suggestion fits in with Paul's ministry, this man and his wife being specially identified with the apostle.<a name=250:12></a> First of all, they are introduced to us as in Corinth, they were of a certain craft; apparently both occupied in the same craft -- tent makers.<a name=250:13></a> It seems that they worked together, and Paul joined them -- not because they were Christians, it does not say that; but "because they were of the same craft"(<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#18:3">Acts  18:3</a>).<a name=250:14></a> All this comes in where the great thought of the assembly is worked out locally, that is Corinth.<a name=250:15></a>

		Aquila and Priscilla are mentioned three times together in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#18">Acts  18</a>.<a name=251:1></a> The idea of wisdom would be there; the first epistle to the Corinthians shows that the idea of divine wisdom was prominent in Paul's service there, and Priscilla would not fail to suggest that "the wisdom of women buildeth their house", (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#14:1">Proverbs  14:1</a>).<a name=251:2></a> Wisdom is a feminine word; the feminine idea in this sense leads to the assembly.<a name=251:3></a> "The wisdom of women buildeth their house; but folly plucketh it down with her hands", <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#14:1">Proverbs  14:1</a>.<a name=251:4></a> So that you can understand how that thought would be present, at least to the mind of Paul, as to Priscilla -- what a fine sister she was!<a name=251:5></a> Now I am speaking of her because of the way she is mentioned in these different references.<a name=251:6></a> Her name appears first as <i>often</i>  as Aquila's does.<a name=251:7></a> You will find, "Aquila and Priscilla", and then "Priscilla and Aquila", and then you find "Aquila and Priscilla", and then again "Priscilla and Aquila"; is that accidental?<a name=251:8></a> No, it is educational: that is to call attention to what is <i>possible</i>,  and what is possible should always be aimed at; it should never be regarded as impossible.<a name=251:9></a> If it were possible in these two, it is possible in any two, and it is possible in Christ and in the assembly as His body.<a name=251:10></a> So that we find these two, as I said, interchangeably having precedence one of the other.<a name=251:11></a> Not that Priscilla would ever <i>take</i>  precedence of her husband: were we to enter their house -- and we are told that there was an assembly in their house -- that assembly would be adorned, as I may say, by the seemliness and the grace of this sister, Priscilla.<a name=251:12></a> She would never becloud, she would never stand in the light of her husband: he would the rather shine in her graces, for the woman is <i>of</i>  the man.<a name=251:13></a>

		Now I want to show briefly how all this is foreseen in the gospels, for the gospels are generally to support what we have in the Acts and the epistles.<a name=252:12></a> So Luke gives us two at the beginning; as the Lord Jesus is brought to Jerusalem to the temple, these two persons are there.<a name=252:13></a> The early chapters in this gospel should be studied in relation to our subject.<a name=252:14></a> Luke, only, mentions these two persons, and I believe no brother is in the assembly save as he understands what is presented in Simeon, and that no sister is in the assembly save as she understands and moves according to what is seen in Anna -- they are models.<a name=252:15></a> First of all, as regards Simeon, you have the word "Behold" -- "Behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon".<a name=252:16></a> He is not an ordinary man, but one distinguished as spiritual.<a name=252:17></a> He looked for Christ, he was a man of <i>hope</i>,  a man who counted on what God had said; he expected

		To return to Simeon a certain thing was revealed to him "by the Spirit"; that is to say, he recognised the Spirit; he is dependent on the Spirit for his understanding of things.<a name=254:4></a> "It was divinely communicated to him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death before he should see the Lord's Christ": until he had seen the Man who should do everything for God: he was expecting Him, and he went by the Spirit into the temple, and the Child is brought in and he takes Him in his arms.<a name=254:5></a> The facts are known to us: l am only referring to them now to draw attention to this brother brought forward by Luke, as I verily believe, to show us that our setting is not simply in our houses or our businesses, but, so to speak, <i>in Jerusalem</i>,  it is a spiritual position.<a name=254:6></a> I am in it spiritually, and I come into the temple spiritually, and in the temple I receive Christ.<a name=254:7></a> His being brought is characteristic; there is always someone to bring Him in.<a name=254:8></a> The thought is, of course, that <i>I</i>  should bring Him in.<a name=254:9></a> Here He was brought in by His parents, which, of course, is literal and historical.<a name=254:10></a> It may be that a brother just converted has some little thought of Christ, and a spiritual man takes this little thought -- I say "little" because the Lord Jesus here is just a babe -- and magnifies it, he makes it of use universally.<a name=254:11></a> What a service that is!<a name=254:12></a> And how beautifully he speaks: he says, "Lord, now thou lettest thy bondman go, according to thy word" -- He is regulated by the word: it is no mere sentimental thought, as often expressed by people who say they want to die, and the like: it is a question of the word of God, the mind of God for each of us -- "for mine eyes have seen thy salvation, which thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples; a light for revelation of the gentiles and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It will appeal to every heart here to be reminded that the Lord in the greatest sorrow Psalm, as forsaken of God, speaks about God inhabiting the "praises of Israel", and in that same Psalm in resurrection, having declared God's name to His brethren, says He would sing in the midst of the assembly to Him; the remaining part of the Psalm being full of the idea of praise.<a name=292:4></a> I believe too it would be recognised that Luke, of all the evangelists, furnishes us with what peculiarly answers to this, and not the least, in that he formally links on with 1 Chronicles -- this book linking on with Exodus, where the praises of Israel begin -- chapter 15.<a name=292:5></a> We have there a song by Moses and the children of Israel, extending on to David's ministry; in that song the sanctuary is viewed in an objective way, not in an experimental way, for they were not yet in the land; but in Miriam's refrain there is the indication that there should be something experimental, however little, in the service of God.<a name=292:6></a> The place the women have in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15">Exodus  15</a>in this service suggests what we get in Luke, and we see in chapter 1 the prominence these chosen female vessels have in the service Godward.<a name=292:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The title of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>(Aijeleth-Shahar) is feminine, showing that in the hour of His deepest sorrow the Lord had results for God in this sense in view.<a name=292:8></a> This is fully developed in the assembly.<a name=292:9></a> As we proceed, the Lord, I think, will show us that this gospel is progressive in this feature -- as in others.<a name=292:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.N.<a name=293:3></a> I do not quite catch the connection between Chronicles and Luke; would you make it clear?<a name=293:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=293:5></a> In 1 Chronicles you have the twenty-four courses of priests inaugurated by David, and they are alluded to here in the ministry of Zacharias, who is said to be "of the course of Abia", verse 5.<a name=293:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.E.<a name=293:7></a>S.<a name=293:8></a> Are you suggesting that Luke's line is subjective and that the subjective line is progressive?<a name=293:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=293:10></a> Well, it has a subjective result in view.<a name=293:11></a> We should bear in mind what was remarked as to <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15">Exodus  15</a>, that the body of the song there is objective, leading on to entrance into Canaan and the ministry of David and Solomon.<a name=293:12></a> So we are not restricted in our service Godward to what is purely subjective, or it would be very small.<a name=293:13></a> The first contribution to the praises of Israel gives the idea.<a name=293:14></a> The objective has prominence, and then Miriam, who is said to be "the prophetess, the sister of Aaron", takes the tambour, and the women of Israel follow her with tambours and dances.<a name=293:15></a> She answers practically in the first two lines of the song, and thus intimates that that is about the extent of the spiritual stature of the people.<a name=293:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To make the thing clearer, verse 19 is interposed, to make way for what Miriam says.<a name=293:17></a> It is not poetic, as will be observed.<a name=293:18></a> The song ends in verse 18, and then we have the historical statement: "For the horse of Pharaoh, with his chariots and with his horsemen, came into the sea, and Jehovah brought again the waters of the sea upon them; and the children of Israel went on dry ground through the midst of the sea", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15:19">Exodus  15:19</a>.<a name=293:19></a> That is a plain statement of fact; and then it says, "Miriam the

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.H.<a name=294:6></a>T.<a name=294:7></a> As to the inscrutableness of the Deity, are you referring to verse 22 of chapter 10, "no one knows who the Son is but the Father, and who the Father is but the Son"?<a name=294:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=294:9></a> Yes.<a name=294:10></a> I hope we shall take it up in a subsequent reading, but I refer to it now to show the extent of the praise, that it is not necessarily bounded by our experimental knowledge.<a name=294:11></a> Of course, when <i>Christ</i>  praises the response is complete.<a name=294:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		J.T.<a name=306:11></a> Just so.<a name=306:12></a> The first reference to the Spirit in Corinthians is in chapter 2, and it is to bring out that divine things are revealed by Him: "Things which eye has not seen, and ear not heard, and which have not come into man's heart, which God has prepared for them that love Him", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:9">1 Corinthians  2:9</a>.<a name=306:13></a> Then we have the mind of Christ, which would imply the means of thinking and speaking.<a name=306:14></a> Then in chapter 3 you get the Spirit in the temple; His presence amongst us implies that the temple of God is here, and so the Holy Spirit is linked on right through to the end of the two epistles, finishing up with the "communion of the Holy Spirit".<a name=306:15></a> He is the power of the service.<a name=306:16></a> He forms and instructs us so that we should have the "tongue of the instructed", that we might know how to speak, as it says, "five words with the understanding".<a name=306:17></a>

		J.T.<a name=349:3></a> Well, we have to accept the statement.<a name=349:4></a> One great point in understanding divine things is to settle yourself in the presence of a statement whether you understand it or not, and in due course the Holy Spirit will give you its bearing.<a name=349:5></a> In that connection I would remark that I believe we fail to keep our sabbaths.<a name=349:6></a> The keeping of the sabbath implies lying fallow, especially the land.<a name=349:7></a> The land may be taken to represent a person; in lying fallow divine things settle into him, and he begins to see something of their meaning.<a name=349:8></a> Now this passage is one that is constantly before us, thank God; and I believe what has been said here today is right, that what is said about the Son is a prohibitive thought to shut out the human mind; whereas there is no prohibition in regard of the Father, because it is that Person who is God; He is said formally to be God: "There is one God the Father",(<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#8:6">1 Corinthians  8:6</a>) and it is obvious that He is to be known, as the Lord could say, "He that hath seen me hath seen the Father"(<a href="../bible/John.htm#14:9">John  14:9</a>).<a name=349:9></a> So that revealing the Father is the bringing out of God in the sense of love and grace, but more than that, by a specific revelation; because the word is not "declaration" here, but "revelation", which is always <i>to persons</i> : "he to whomsoever the Son is pleased to reveal him".<a name=349:10></a> It is intimated that the Son may give one a full understanding of the Father.<a name=349:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=354:4></a> Well, the idea of a city is prominent in assembly economy; it denotes an ordered place.<a name=354:5></a> It is a place of man's will, as in this world, but God would set in it what is to displace that.<a name=354:6></a> The principle of the present testimony is, that there is something displacing, by moral superiority, what has proved reprobate.<a name=354:7></a> The world's cities are places of organised evil, and organised evil is the worst form of evil, and God proposes to displace that morally, before He displaces it actually.<a name=354:8></a> He displaces it morally in what He produces in the assembly; so that, throughout the Acts you will find the thought of a city prominent.<a name=354:9></a> The disciples were to continue there, according to the end of Luke; then in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9">Acts  9</a>, Saul is to go into the city to be told in it what to do, meaning that in the city, the place in which man's will was carried out, God had something in which His will was to be carried out.<a name=354:10></a> So Saul is to be told <i>there</i>  what he must do.<a name=354:11></a> Then you have the idea of a "place", which would include anything with a name in the shape of a locality.<a name=354:12></a> A "village" is something between, having somewhat the nature of a town or city, and yet not a city.<a name=354:13></a> The importance of the assembly, by virtue of moral qualities from God, superseding what man has organised, is very great.<a name=354:14></a> The Lord in rejoicing in spirit gives a lead to what is in the assembly in the way of joy, a joy of the highest order.<a name=354:15></a> He rejoiced in spirit, and in regard to the place of His own in the heavens.<a name=354:16></a> It is not merely a better or more ordered religion that we have, but something heavenly, with heavenly feelings attached to it, and all that becomes it in the way of brotherliness, neighbourliness, and household hospitality.<a name=354:17></a> I think that is the idea in chapter 10.<a name=354:18></a>

		J.T.<a name=388:1></a> At the close of our meeting this morning we considered verses 39 to 46 of chapter 22, which depict the Lord's sufferings, and it was noted that, while they are a record of His sufferings from the standpoint of this gospel, there is an indication of mitigation on the part of God, which would cover our own experiences or the experiences of the assembly; God's eye being constantly upon us so that we should not be tempted above what we are able to bear, but that the service should go on.<a name=388:2></a> Sufferings give tone to the service.<a name=388:3></a> It says, "For it became him .<a name=388:4></a>.<a name=388:5></a>.<a name=388:6></a> in bringing many sons to glory, to make perfect the leader of their salvation through sufferings", (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:10">Hebrews  2:10</a>).<a name=388:7></a> The book of Revelation shows how sufferings enter into the praises of God.<a name=388:8></a> That book is full of life, which issues in praise to God.<a name=388:9></a> As Hezekiah said, "The living, the living, he shall praise thee", (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#38:19">Isaiah  38:19</a>).<a name=388:10></a> The book of Revelation contemplates the Lamb, not in the mature sense in which the gospel of John presents Him as "the Lamb of God", but in a diminutive sense (the diminutive noun being used in the Greek), involving the absence of protection, so that He is presented as the suffering One.<a name=388:11></a> Luke, whilst not ignoring Matthew and Mark, brings in the sufferings of Christ more as that in which we can share, and which gives tone to our service.<a name=388:12></a>

		as to our bodies; the Lord is, and He is presented objectively in that condition in resurrection, obviously for educational reasons, that the assembly should take on that character; as it is said, "being seen of them during forty days"; in chapter 24 we have the assembly in that relation.<a name=389:1></a> It is the assembly publicly, but nevertheless in a condition morally, to which the Lord can come.<a name=389:2></a> The two sides of the assembly viewed in these chapters, 22 and 24, constitute it an invulnerable vessel, like the ark of Noah: it goes through.<a name=389:3></a> In chapter 22 its foundations are laid, so to speak, in the presence of murderous opposition, but laid surely.<a name=389:4></a> That is to say, what happens is in the presence of accredited witnesses, qualified to testify to what the Lord did and said in the institution of the Supper.<a name=389:5></a> That is never to be lost sight of.<a name=389:6></a> The memorial is to retain what Christ was, as known amongst them.<a name=389:7></a> As it is said, "who have assembled with us all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us, beginning from the baptism of John until the day in which he was taken up".<a name=389:8></a> (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:21">Acts  1:21</a>, 22).<a name=389:9></a> All that entered into the Lord's supper, for His heart was fully told out to them in the gift of Himself so beautifully depicted.<a name=389:10></a>

		Then chapter 24 gives us the other side of the position, the spiritual condition in which He is now, and in virtue of which He may be with us, unseen by the world, and with all the unceasing service that He carries on, mediately now, of course, but still carried on with a view to the formation and maintenance of the assembly.<a name=389:11></a> The two that went to Emmaus are samples of the result of this unceasing ministry, so that the assembly should be maintained here, the idea of authority entering into it now that He is not here corporeally Himself.<a name=389:12></a> The <i>eleven</i>  are there.<a name=389:13></a> There were twelve in chapter 22 -- an unbroken number, but now there is a broken number, but still the authority is there, and the recovered ones return and find "the eleven", as it says, "and those with them gathered together".<a name=389:14></a> It is not the side presented

		Then, to link on with John's record, the Lord's communications at the last Supper, the beginning of chapter 13, tells us that He was going <i>to the Father</i> : "Jesus, knowing that his hour had come that he should depart out of this world to the Father .<a name=399:5></a>.<a name=399:6></a>.<a name=399:7></a>" That being introductory to chapters 13 to 17, is to remind us that the mind of the Lord was toward the Father in what this section presents.<a name=399:8></a> The writers of the first three gospels in recording the events of the last Supper do not make any reference to His going to the Father; they are concerned about the public side, of which we have spoken, and of which we get the climax in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24">Luke  24</a>and <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>.<a name=399:9></a> John brings in another line, in order to complete the instruction -- that the Lord, whilst He was dealing with the Supper and the things relating to it, also had in mind the Father, to whom He was going; and He would draw them into that current.<a name=399:10></a> So that we get much more from John about what occurred that night than we do from the others, and all, I believe, to draw our minds and hearts into the current of the Lord's mind.<a name=399:11></a> He was going to the Father, and He would have us to go with Him, not yet literally, but in spirit.<a name=399:12></a> In Luke He leads them out as far as to Bethany, showing how perfectly He moved in keeping with the dispensation: He did not lead them further than that, because He would let the idea of the remnant stand, which Bethany suggests; so as to continue the testimony to Israel, to give every possible advantage to the Jews.<a name=399:13></a> Thus at the end they are in the temple praising and blessing God, but that was not final; it was just in agreement with Bethany.<a name=399:14></a> So the beginning of Acts gives us more particulars as to their own movements after His going up; they returned from the <i>mount of Olives</i> ,which

	<div class="paragraph">
		Having the subject thus briefly set out, we may dwell on the first, the patriarchal thought.<a name=405:2></a> It is not beyond any of us, for, as I remarked, it is really a question of love of the brethren.<a name=405:3></a> Although we may begin to love the brethren very young, as left here in the testimony we shall not remain young; we quickly pass the youthful stage and others come in who are younger.<a name=405:4></a> So that we, as actuated by love, begin to regard those who are younger as the objects of paternal care.<a name=405:5></a> As we grow older, this becomes accentuated as younger ones come along constantly.<a name=405:6></a> One generation passes away and another comes -- that is a fixed fact, and as we merge into middle age, or old age, we begin to think of the passing away.<a name=405:7></a> Not indeed that saints all live to be very old; it is of course not so, but I am speaking of how <i>love works</i>,  and nothing can be more interesting in the whole field of knowledge than love's way.<a name=405:8></a> The first commandment with promise is to the young, "that it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth", (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#6:3">Ephesians  6:3</a>).<a name=405:9></a> It is a promise to be valued, and will not be abused by love.<a name=405:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As the youthful stage passes, we begin, as governed by love, to look with fatherly care on those who are younger; and as we are allowed to continue here in the wisdom of God, there is scope for love to operate in this as in other ways.<a name=405:11></a> As I said, one of the most interesting features in the whole field of knowledge is the movement of divine love, and it will be observed that it eventuates in a fatherly development in believers.<a name=405:12></a> Perhaps the need for fathers is as great as any that is current.<a name=405:13></a> One could count a great many who have reached, under the wise government of God, the stage in life to which spiritual fatherhood properly belongs, and God would lay it upon us that it should be assumed.<a name=405:14></a> It is not exactly an office, it is a family relationship developed in love, but developed too, in certain moral connections

		as indicated in the name of the great father -- Abraham.<a name=406:1></a> His first name was <i>Abram</i>,  which, as no doubt most of you know, means "high father".<a name=406:2></a> That was before he had a family, as if the idea of <i>moral</i>  elevation as attached to separation from the world, is essential to fatherhood.<a name=406:3></a> That is to say, we begin to love the saints, not from natural proclivities or because of natural links or natural correspondence; we begin to regard them differently, that is in elevated moral relations.<a name=406:4></a> The idea of "high father" is in contrast to all that attaches to man in the flesh which is low and gravitates towards the earth and grovels there, and so we begin to look at the brethren from the standpoint of moral elevation, and thus love in this connection begins to show itself.<a name=406:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, all this is seen in the history of Abraham, and then to some extent in the history of Isaac, and finally in the history of Jacob; and what comes out in Jacob is that he had the experience of the <i>loss</i>  of children.<a name=406:6></a> He temporarily lost two, and so had experience thus occasioned.<a name=406:7></a> Now that enters into love's position at the present time.<a name=406:8></a> Many have been lost, and we qualify among other things, in the way we regard those who have been lost, for we cannot afford to lose <i>any</i>  of our brethren, however unlovable they may seem to be.<a name=406:9></a> I believe that Jacob had in his thoughts the essentialness of the twelve, that they <i>must not</i>  be lost.<a name=406:10></a> Divine counsels required the twelve, but "one is not"; that was the sorrowful note that had to be struck.<a name=406:11></a> And again, "Joseph is not, and Simeon is not", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#42:36">Genesis  42:36</a>.<a name=406:12></a> That is to say love is wrenched and tortured by the loss of children, children once possessed, but possessed no longer.<a name=406:13></a>

		And now he said to Joseph, "Who are these?<a name=407:13></a>" It is an old man speaking, a man of great experience -- largely through his own failure, indeed, but in spite of this of God's love, for God loved Jacob; as scripture says, "Jacob have I loved".<a name=407:14></a> He met him at Luz as he was on his way to Haran, and He met him as he came back, and in a most familiar way, and ennobled him, giving him a great spiritual name; and He told him His own name also.<a name=407:15></a> He met him again as He was going out of Canaan to Egypt, and said He was the God of his father Isaac, assuring him, in type, that every thought of His was secured infallibly in a risen Christ.<a name=407:16></a> And now, "Who are these?<a name=407:17></a>" We may well look around and ask such a question.<a name=407:18></a> "And Joseph said unto his father.<a name=407:19></a> They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place.<a name=407:20></a> And he said.<a name=407:21></a> Bring them, I

		Nothing is more blinding in the things of God than nature.<a name=408:6></a> So that Jacob at the advanced age of a hundred and forty-seven years has maintained freshness of affection for the young, and discernment, where nature would blind him, as it blinded his father Isaac.<a name=408:7></a> Nature did not blind Jacob.<a name=408:8></a> He was able to say, "I know it, my son".<a name=408:9></a> He knew which was the elder and which the younger, and he knew the mind of God about both.<a name=408:10></a> He blessed them both, the Spirit of God tells us in the New Testament, <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:21">Hebrews  11:21</a>; but he put his right hand upon Ephraim's head and his left upon the head of Manasseh, against the wishes of the most powerful man outwardly in Egypt, next to the king.<a name=408:11></a> We must not think it was regarded as a trivial matter by Joseph; it was not.<a name=408:12></a> Jacob's action was regarded as "evil" in his eyes, and what was evil in the eyes of a man like Joseph in Egypt was something to be stopped, and he sought to stop it.<a name=408:13></a> We have to learn in our old age to go against the current, and maintain the mind of God.<a name=408:14></a> As we grow older we are apt to give way to

		That is what I had in mind as most needed and important at the present time; that God would put it upon the brethren to develop the fatherly and motherly instincts, and to maintain the affections proper even in old age, so that the will of God goes through unimpaired.<a name=409:7></a> Then, to go a little further, you see in Jacob how he gathered his sons together to listen to Israel their father.<a name=409:8></a> It is not now a question of young people brought to one, so that he might express his love to them and the mind of God about them, but here is definite initiative on the part of the patriarch.<a name=409:9></a> "Hearken unto Israel your father", he says, and I will "tell you that which shall befall you in the last days"(<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#49:1">Genesis  49:1</a>).<a name=409:10></a> What an advantage to have a father like that!<a name=409:11></a> And he hesitates not to tell them all the truth.<a name=409:12></a> Sons of his though they were, he tells them all the truth.<a name=409:13></a> It is necessary that we should have the whole truth told us; it is no love to withhold the truth from the brethren.<a name=409:14></a> And then we are told that he <i>blessed</i>  them.<a name=409:15></a> Everyone of them was blessed -- such is a father; he cannot think of the saints otherwise than that they should be blessed.<a name=409:16></a> It is the true fatherly instinct that the young should be blessed; and so he blessed each of them according to his blessing.<a name=409:17></a> Jacob as dying was in the mind of God.<a name=409:18></a>

		So that what you find with David is that at the beginning he is marked by personal greatness, for the thought of a king is that he is a man that is <i>able</i>,  the official comes afterwards.<a name=413:1></a> The introduction of David in Scripture is most beautiful.<a name=413:2></a> The first description we have of him in <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#16">1 Samuel  16</a>is intended to attract the heart; that is the first thought.<a name=413:3></a> A brother, if he is to be morally great amongst the saints, is first to be <i>lovable</i>.<a name=413:4></a> I am not to climb into prominence by my ability; the first thing is personal lovability.<a name=413:5></a> That is the idea, that one is loved; a man like David is bound to be loved.<a name=413:6></a> Samuel said to Jesse, "Are here all thy children?<a name=413:7></a>" There is yet one, he says, "and, behold, he keepeth the sheep".<a name=413:8></a> And Samuel said, "Send and fetch him; for we will not sit down till he comes hither", <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#16:11">1 Samuel  16:11</a>; and as he arrived, Jehovah said, "Arise, anoint him: for this is he"(<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#16:12">1 Samuel  16:12</a>).<a name=413:9></a> But that is not all.<a name=413:10></a> "Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance"; he was of a lovely appearance.<a name=413:11></a> The idea is that he was attractive.<a name=413:12></a> The attention of everybody there could not but be riveted on that young man.<a name=413:13></a> I suppose Jesse never saw such beauty in David before, as he saw when Jehovah called attention to him; and there he was in the midst of his brethren.<a name=413:14></a> I suppose they, too, never saw such beauty in that young man before!<a name=413:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, that is the thought.<a name=413:16></a> God will call attention to a man as to his personal character first -- what he is.<a name=413:17></a> Then the next description we have of David is by a young man in Saul's service.<a name=413:18></a> "Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse",(<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#16:18">1 Samuel  16:18</a>) and he plays well.<a name=413:19></a> Some of us have been engaged with that today.<a name=413:20></a> It was inherent in the man, as I may say.<a name=413:21></a> Although a shepherd by occupation, he knew music, he knew how to play well.<a name=413:22></a> He was a valiant man, too, and a man of war, and of good presence, and Jehovah was with him.<a name=413:23></a> That is the second introduction to David.<a name=413:24></a> Need I say that all the qualities of kingship were there?<a name=413:25></a> But the kingly qualities are not the first presented; the lovableness is the first thing

		presented in David.<a name=414:1></a> So that one becomes an object of affection to the brethren, and then one's ability comes into use.<a name=414:2></a> David served even a Saul!<a name=414:3></a> It would be most difficult to serve persons like Saul, one affected by an evil spirit, but David served him acceptably, such was his moral greatness.<a name=414:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Proceeding now to the closing moments of his life, we shall see that in these he is equal to all this.<a name=414:5></a> It is the full development; his heart is still full of the house of God.<a name=414:6></a> His heart was on the house from the time when he said, "I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids, until I find out a place for the Lord, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob.<a name=414:7></a> Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood", (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#132:4">Psalm  132:4</a> - 6), and he brought the ark to Zion.<a name=414:8></a> That was the great burden of his life; his kingship was subservient to that, to make a place for God.<a name=414:9></a> What a great thought, to have any part, however small, in making a place for the habitation of the mighty God of Jacob!<a name=414:10></a> So, from the time he saw the sheathing of the sword at the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite, until this chapter 29, he is full of the house.<a name=414:11></a> It was the great end and result of his kingly power and resources.<a name=414:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But what I want to show further is what is most important for ministers.<a name=414:13></a> As we get older there is a tendency to assume priority, and to set up a little throne and refuse anyone a place near it.<a name=414:14></a> Now that is the very disposition that David did not have, because he made Solomon king along with himself.<a name=414:15></a> He did not say to Solomon, You wait, do not come into power till I am gone.<a name=414:16></a> True greatness in the elders will make ample room for the younger; the more ability the better.<a name=414:17></a> So that David made Solomon king, chapter 23; and we read here, chapter 29, that he was made king "the second time".<a name=414:18></a> I ask the brethren to examine these chapters, and see how much is made of Solomon being made king.<a name=414:19></a> You say, why do you speak of that?<a name=414:20></a> Just because of the importance of the elder making

		room for the younger, that is, for those in whom moral greatness appears.<a name=415:1></a> They will only enhance us; they will not interfere with our ministry.<a name=415:2></a> The more royalty the better; and Solomon had true royalty.<a name=415:3></a> It is said that Jehovah loved him; he was loved from his youth; like David, he was lovable; Jehovah loved him.<a name=415:4></a> He was loved of his father and mother, too.<a name=415:5></a> So, throughout this section, from chapter 22 onward, the Spirit of God dwells upon the fact that Solomon the son of David is king; and David is perfectly restful in the kingly position of his son alongside of him.<a name=415:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So these three features, dear brethren, as I said before, are intended to attach to each, and God would press them upon us so that the testimony should go on.<a name=415:7></a> There is no idea at all of any interference with the carrying out of the will of God.<a name=415:8></a> As one generation passes away, the coming generation is to carry on the service, and it is the intention that they should have every possible advantage, and, on the other hand, it is imperative they should be in suitability and seemliness in their service.<a name=415:9></a> Solomon was made king by David, and he sat on the throne with David, so that we have the father and the son exercising royal power together, and all with a view to "the palace".<a name=415:10></a> Beloved, let us have in our hearts the thought of the <i>palace</i>,  <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#29:19">1 Chronicles  29:19</a>.<a name=415:11></a> If there is to be a palace for God we need all the help that God has provided to this end.<a name=415:12></a> The building was to be "exceeding, magnifical", and David had that in mind.<a name=415:13></a> He says: "Thine, O Lord, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine; thine: is the kingdom, O Lord, and thou art exalted as head above all".<a name=415:14></a> How powerful and beautiful is that language!<a name=415:15></a> And how fitting it is for us, in any little place or work He has given us, that it should be always fully owned that it is He who is providing and doing all!<a name=415:16></a> May God bless these thoughts to us!<a name=415:17></a>
