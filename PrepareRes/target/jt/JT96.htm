		These scriptures speak of the Word of God, a title which is applied to the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=1:1></a> It is said of Him in the book of Revelation that His name is called the Word of God.<a name=1:2></a> That will enable us to understand this expression in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#4">Hebrews  4</a>, that "the word of God is living and operative", and that is something which in a living way was seen in the service of Christ here on earth.<a name=1:3></a> The woman at the well of Sychar is a type of this; her inner state was penetrated by the Word so that she could say that He had told her all things she ever did.<a name=1:4></a> The Word of God has always that effect when it has access to the heart.<a name=1:5></a> It has a searching character, but at the same time an edifying effect, and thus it is said that "the worlds were framed by the word of God",

		Twelve spies were sent out and when they came back their collective testimony was that the land was good.<a name=2:13></a> Later ten of them denied their testimony but Caleb and Joshua kept to it, so that there was in Caleb and Joshua a complete testimony as to the land.<a name=2:14></a> It also says that they carried with them a cluster of grapes from the valley of Eshcol and this was borne between two on a pole.<a name=2:15></a> The testimony was therefore not only in words but there was proof in the fruit that they brought with them from the land.<a name=2:16></a> And, beloved brethren, it is of great interest that in the chapter where all this is recorded (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#13">Numbers  13</a>) it

		Instead of turning back as the Israelites were doing in resistance against the word of God, we subject ourselves to the love which is ours, and determine to go forward in the assurance that our high priest will be with us to the end.<a name=5:4></a> It is beautiful to dwell on Caleb's and Joshua's testimony.<a name=5:5></a> It was no hurried survey they made in Canaan and it was not one-sided.<a name=5:6></a> There were twelve of them and they remained in the land forty days.<a name=5:7></a> They brought back with them the bunch of grapes as an evidence of the fertility of the land.<a name=5:8></a> The words of Caleb and Joshua are beautiful.<a name=5:9></a> They said, "The land, which we passed through to search it out, is a very, very good land.<a name=5:10></a> If Jehovah delight in us, he will bring us into this land, and give it us, a land that flows with milk and honey; only rebel not against Jehovah".<a name=5:11></a> These verses contain, as you see, a loving offer to the people.<a name=5:12></a> God has provided the means which we need to enter the land.<a name=5:13></a> He has delight in us.<a name=5:14></a> How wonderful to think that God delights in us, that He loves us so much that He has provided such a land for us.<a name=5:15></a> Beloved brethren, let this land be our longing; our great high priest is prepared to help us right to the end.<a name=5:16></a>

		From this we understand, beloved brethren, that while <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#4">Hebrews  4</a>would help us to go into Canaan as those who believe a testimony which has come down from heaven, this chapter in Peter would show us that we on the way should be marked by brotherly love, which is a result of the effect of the word of God in us, so that it can be said that we are born again by it.<a name=6:15></a> Therefore if I love the brethren from this viewpoint, I know why I do it.<a name=6:16></a> My intelligence has been formed by the word of God.<a name=6:17></a> To be born

		This attack of the Assyrian is accorded a prominent position in the divine records, in the historical books and also in this book of Isaiah, the prophet.<a name=48:1></a> Inasmuch as it appears in the prophet, it has a prophetic setting, and therefore a prophetic voice.<a name=48:2></a> We read in the New Testament of the voice of the prophets.<a name=48:3></a> It may be that we have not heard the voice of the prophets, but it is a voice intended for us, especially as to this feature, this attack of the Assyrian against Jerusalem, because, as moving according to the will of God, as we are thus, we are the objects of attack.<a name=48:4></a> No person, or number of persons, corresponding in any way to Christ in this world, can escape attack, especially so if we recognise the church.<a name=48:5></a> There are many of the Lord's people who do not recognise the church; in fact they hardly know what the word means, for, in current language, the word has lost its primary meaning.<a name=48:6></a> Perhaps one true believer out of ten could give, could convey, the scriptural idea of the church; he must therefore consider whether he is walking in the light implied in the word.<a name=48:7></a> The word 'church' in Scripture is properly translated 'assembly'.<a name=48:8></a> The ordinary word is applied now to religious bodies, or religious buildings.<a name=48:9></a> But primarily it is a word applied to Christians referring only to them as people called out of the world, separated from it, and set up in holy unity and fellowship.<a name=48:10></a> We have in the epistle to the Corinthians the classifications of persons resident in any town; in the early days there were the Jews; that is to say, those who resorted to the synagogue; and there were the gentiles or Greeks, who resorted to the idol temples; and there were the Christians, who met together and were called the

		The voice of the prophets is of great importance as bearing on the saints viewed in this light.<a name=49:3></a> They are the objects of attack, and this feature in Isaiah contains both instruction and encouragement to us, as to how the position of the saints as called out, as separated, as set up here, according to the will of God collectively, is defended and protected.<a name=49:4></a> So that Isaiah, whose prophecy is more intensive in its bearing than that of any other of the prophets, includes this important event of the attack of Sennacherib upon Jerusalem and Judah in the days of Hezekiah.<a name=49:5></a> It is to bring in the prophetic voice, so that it should be heard, and be a comfort and an instruction to us.<a name=49:6></a> The prophetic voice is not merely instruction; it is what the word signifies -- "a word from God".<a name=49:7></a> The prophet brings God to the conscience, and so the apostle says to the Corinthians, "But if all prophesy, and some unbeliever or simple person come in, he is convicted of all, he is judged of all; the secrets of his heart are manifested; and thus, falling upon his face, he will do homage to God, reporting that God is indeed amongst you", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14:24">1 Corinthians  14:24</a>, 25.<a name=49:8></a> He came into the Christian assembly.<a name=49:9></a> Why did he not go to the synagogue?<a name=49:10></a> Why were his feet directed to these people having no ecclesiastical standing, no religious status at all?<a name=49:11></a> Why had he come?<a name=49:12></a> It is a good question for any person who knows the ministry of the Spirit of God -- why did he come?<a name=49:13></a> <i>He came</i>.<a name=49:14></a> It is well for you that he did.<a name=49:15></a> And he falls down as the prophet ministers the word of prophecy.<a name=49:16></a> There is not much moral fibre, beloved friends, if he does not learn to fall down.<a name=49:17></a> The Lord Jesus is said by Simon to be set for the <i>fall</i> and rising again of many in Israel.<a name=49:18></a> One who falls on that stone may be broken.<a name=49:19></a>

		These scriptures, dear brethren, are as well known perhaps as any, and better than most.<a name=61:1></a> They are very familiar among the saints, but they wear wonderfully well and yield always, and what I desire to deduce from them in this service, is the idea of influence.<a name=61:2></a> It is an idea that is prominent in John's gospel, and one which is of immense importance, both physically and spiritually.<a name=61:3></a> It is one of the leading principles of the physical universe, and it is well always to remember in regard of the things that are made, that in them the invisible things of God are clearly seen or apprehended by the mind, and so they become instructive, immensely so.<a name=61:4></a> They were always intended to be instructive, but those of us who know God in redemption, and who have the Spirit, understand them best.<a name=61:5></a> They were intended from the outset to be a lesson book, a witness indeed, so that the psalmist from whom we get the most intelligent touches in the Old Testament alludes to this, referring especially to the heavens, saying that they "declare the glory of God" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#19:1">Psalm  19:1</a>), a strong thought -- they "declare", similar to <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:18">John  1:18</a>, in which we read that "The only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, <i>he</i> hath declared him".<a name=61:6></a> The idea is that God is brought out to us, brought within the range of our intelligence.<a name=61:7></a> Some think that what has happened is that the veil has been drawn aside, and the creature looks in to whatever existed in the Deity, which would make the creature equal, we might say equal to God, as if he could look at God in His infinite essence and relations; the very verse I have cited says explicitly that no one has seen Him at any time.<a name=61:8></a> It is not that no one had

		seen Him, but no one has seen Him; and John wrote that verse long after the Lord Jesus was here and had gone back into heaven.<a name=62:1></a> No one has seen Him at any time.<a name=62:2></a> Then he adds, "The only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, <i>he</i> hath declared him"; the idea is that He is brought out so that He is to be apprehended by men, and even by angels, for it is said of them that the incarnation enabled them to see God, "seen of angels", as if it were only then they saw God; they are creatures.<a name=62:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, I only touch on that because of the word "declare", the idea of declaration in the heavens.<a name=62:4></a> They "declare the glory of God", a very great fact.<a name=62:5></a> We look at them constantly.<a name=62:6></a> They "declare the glory of God; and the expanse sheweth the work of his hands.<a name=62:7></a> Day unto day uttereth speech".<a name=62:8></a> It is not casual.<a name=62:9></a> The word "uttereth" is a strong word.<a name=62:10></a> It is the idea of something gushing out, indicating the fulness and testimony in the heavenly bodies.<a name=62:11></a> "And night unto night sheweth knowledge".<a name=62:12></a> That is another strong word.<a name=62:13></a> The thing is shown.<a name=62:14></a> It is there to be read by anyone who has eyes to see.<a name=62:15></a> And then the psalmist adds, "In them hath he set a tent for the sun, And he is as a bridegroom going forth from his chamber; he rejoiceth as a strong man to run the race", a beautiful figure of Christ.<a name=62:16></a> But there it is in the Psalms all these centuries, thousands of years; there He is day after day, a beautiful figure, bringing in what is most interesting about man, a bridegroom or a bride, "He is as a bridegroom going forth from his chamber".<a name=62:17></a> How much we can read into that, dear friends, as to Christ!<a name=62:18></a> Then there is the strength, the energy: "He rejoiceth as a strong man to run the race.<a name=62:19></a> His going forth is from the end of the heavens, and his circuit unto the ends of it; and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof".<a name=62:20></a> There is that which is to be seen and that which is to be felt in the testimony of God.<a name=62:21></a> And then we have the

		further thought: "There is no speech, and there are no words", that is to say, what we call language.<a name=63:1></a> There is a language, "uttereth speech", but there are no ordinary words in it.<a name=63:2></a> And yet the psalmist says, "Their voice is heard"; so someone hears it, this powerful influence that is set in the heavens as a witness for God.<a name=63:3></a> Then on the other hand we have the idea of influence on earth, in rivers, oceans, seas, lakes and mountains; all are influential, trees, forests, but particularly rivers, because of their motion.<a name=63:4></a> They become peculiarly suggestive of the presence of the Holy Spirit.<a name=63:5></a> So we have right throughout the Scripture, the idea of a great influence for good in rivers, and what is the most suggestive and interesting of all is that one of them, a river, went out of Eden, and went out for an express purpose.<a name=63:6></a> It was not a mere accident; it was to water the garden.<a name=63:7></a> From this it is parted, we are told, into four heads or main streams, and then the names are given.<a name=63:8></a> Of one of them it is said that it surrounds a good land, "And the gold of that land is good".<a name=63:9></a> Is that a mere accident that that should be mentioned?<a name=63:10></a> No!<a name=63:11></a> It is spiritual, it is the flow, and the action of this great influence on earth that brings the gold to light.<a name=63:12></a> We often wonder why it is that Asia has not yielded so much for God; Africa has not yielded so much for God.<a name=63:13></a> These countries will yield for God, but for the moment it is the West, and God has directed the course of the stream with the utmost intelligence and precision, so that "The gold of that land is good".<a name=63:14></a> What He needs for the assembly, the mighty movements of the Spirit through ministry, the river of God's grace, as Paul says, "From Jerusalem", not towards China; there is nothing much to indicate that there was anything in that direction; but "from Jerusalem .<a name=63:15></a>.<a name=63:16></a>.<a name=63:17></a> round to Illyricum", that is to say, from Jerusalem through Asia Minor, Macedonia, Greece and the

		Well now, having said all that, I want to show the simple evidence of it in John's gospel, and I may say here that I and others have often remarked that John is astronomical in his forms of expression; not that he deals exactly with heavenly bodies as bodies, but as he speaks of Christ it is not a question with

		I have in mind, dear brethren, to speak about the feature of the divine nature expressed in care, in care for others, in what is expressed in us.<a name=96:1></a> Thus whatever feature of the divine nature shows itself, it has had its expression in Christ first, but I confine my remarks to the idea of care.<a name=96:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is seen in these scriptures, first in regard to a christian (an individual) and then secondly in regard to a church (the church in its real setting) and thirdly in regard of all the churches.<a name=96:3></a> These are the thoughts I have in mind and it is to the end that we might be enlarged first in caring for one's neighbour, then in caring for the local company in which one may be, involving fellowship in its local feature, and then for all the churches involving what may be termed general fellowship.<a name=96:4></a> I believe this is the order in which we are developed in this divine feature.<a name=96:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We get examples in the Old Testament, and the fundamental principle, as I might call it, of the local company is the neighbour.<a name=96:6></a> One arrives at the local feature of the church by beginning with the neighbour and so in the Old Testament you have that thought embodied in the law, indeed it is in the Lord's own condensation of the law: the second commandment is like unto the first.<a name=96:7></a> The first is the supreme idea; the second is very near it, it is like unto it.<a name=96:8></a> The first is, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart", etc.<a name=96:9></a>, that is my relations with God, and the second is, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself", on these two, says the Lord, hang all the law and the prophets.<a name=96:10></a>

		Hence the Lord said, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#14:6">John  14:6</a>), all is there, but volumes could not contain what anyone of these things is, as opened up, and so this commandment as I said, is second, it is like unto the first, for all the divine truth hangs together, but there is the principle of one, two and three in divine things and that enters into all the orderings of God, the order of one, two and three.<a name=97:4></a> The first is the supreme idea and the second is like unto it so that great place is given to this principle of the neighbour and then to the care of more than one person.<a name=97:5></a>

		Aaron is a development in secret; he is not brought forward in Scripture until he was a very old man, he was never known as a young brother publicly as far as Scripture goes.<a name=98:7></a> He was known to God and he is introduced to Moses at that old age, Moses himself being nearly as old, about three years younger, so that there would ever be that test between the two that the most prominent in the service of God was younger.<a name=98:8></a> But he is introduced by Jehovah to Moses as Aaron the Levite, "Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother?<a name=98:9></a> I know that he can speak well", Jehovah says, and he is coming to meet you and when h sees you he will be glad in his heart (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#4:14">Exodus  4:14</a>).<a name=98:10></a>

		That is the one and he proved all that Jehovah said about him; I think God looks for that, dear brethren.<a name=98:11></a> He looks for confirmation of His choice and Aaron was not behind so far; he was the brother and he could speak well, and the best evidence of the fact that he could speak well was that when he spoke to Israel they turned away from Egypt to the wilderness (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#16:10">Exodus  16:10</a>).<a name=98:12></a> The man that can turn the saints away from Egypt is a worthy man.<a name=98:13></a> They had just been talking about Egypt and the fleshpots and how well they fared there; they said it just as worldly-minded christians say it.<a name=98:14></a> They were inclined to go back and Aaron spoke to them; Moses directed him to speak to them, and as he spoke to them they looked to the wilderness, and as they looked towards the wilderness they saw the glory of Jehovah.<a name=98:15></a> It is worth while looking towards the wilderness to see

		Now Aaron is left to look after the people; I do not say that he is successful, I am not speaking of that side as Aaron was not.<a name=99:2></a> But he had all the qualifications, he was the brother and he could speak well and he could influence the saints by his speaking.<a name=99:3></a> He could influence them towards the wilderness and any speaking that does not influence towards the wilderness is not to be trusted.<a name=99:4></a> Any writings or books that do not direct towards the wilderness are not to be trusted.<a name=99:5></a>

		Paul, in writing to the Corinthians so as to induce them to be spiritual, refers to the number of times that the Lord appeared to His own.<a name=101:1></a> It is as if He would impress His own, before they entered the service, that it is spiritual and to be done in a spiritual manner.<a name=101:2></a> The book of Acts shows how things are to be done.<a name=101:3></a> Luke begins that narrative by telling us how the Lord showed Himself after His suffering, after His death, with many proofs, and that He assembled with them.<a name=101:4></a> Then Peter says, 'now we are less than twelve'.<a name=101:5></a> It is a good thing to accept that we are less than the required number.<a name=101:6></a> The Lord, according to Matthew, recognises the eleven, and He was not deterred by the fact that they were less than twelve, but Peter recognised it.<a name=101:7></a>

		It is a very wholesome thing to accept that we are less than twelve.<a name=101:8></a> Some humiliating thing has happened, why this dividing, why this shortage, why this trouble?<a name=101:9></a> Well, we accept it, and the Lord knows the explanation, but the breach has to be filled, the twelfth is to be added.<a name=101:10></a> I may say that twelve is complete administration, the administration of love has to go on, twelve signifies this.<a name=101:11></a> Then we must take account of the Lord's manner, and how He did things, and so the apostle says as to the disciple who is to be the twelfth apostle, that he must be one of those who assembled with us during all the time the Lord Jesus came in and went out amongst us from the baptism of John until He was received up.<a name=101:12></a> That is the idea, everything must be learned from Christ.<a name=101:13></a> If I am to assemble rightly with my brethren I must learn that; He assembled with them, and so if I am to know how to care for a christian I must learn that in Christ.<a name=101:14></a>

		There is a wonderful interchange of influences in the gatherings.<a name=105:11></a> They are not merely local assemblies, for God is against any sectarian idea.<a name=105:12></a> They form one assembly.<a name=105:13></a> Local companies are not independent of one another.<a name=105:14></a> There is only one fellowship, dear brethren, we might as well accept that.<a name=105:15></a> We can thus never say, 'It is not your affair' to any brother.<a name=105:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is only one fellowship, it takes a local form, the local merges into the general and wisdom knows how to discriminate.<a name=105:17></a> Hence we have that passage, "using diligence to keep the unity of the Spirit", for there is one body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, over all, through all and in us all, that is the position it requires enlargement and wisdom to distinguish where the local feature arises.<a name=105:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Corinthians is the local feature, Ephesians is the general feature, that is the way the matter stands,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	<div class="paragraph">
		and hence you get in Ephesians, "the love which ye have towards all the saints".<a name=106:1></a> The more love we have towards God and to the saints, the more we have for all, even if they be strangers, they all belong to the assembly and they are welcome, that is the principle.<a name=106:2></a> Wisdom may order certain things that everybody recognises, but that is the Spirit.<a name=106:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, now you see how that was worked out in the apostle; as I said, it was not an office.<a name=106:4></a> The things that he relates in this particular chapter which I have read are things that he would have preferred to have kept secret until the judgment-seat of Christ, but it was a question of love, that is the idea.<a name=106:5></a> A man whose heart was so large that he almost took in the fulness of the breastplate; his heart was so great as formed by the Spirit of God, his love for the assembly was so great, not only in the general way, he does not say care for the whole assembly but for all the assemblies.<a name=106:6></a> I do not know how many assemblies there were; there are assemblies now, but Paul had them all.<a name=106:7></a> I can understand him having a list before him as he prayed.<a name=106:8></a> He writes to one of them that he had never seen, the assembly at Colosse, and he did not simply pray but he agonised for them.<a name=106:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now for the experience of that man in regard to the testimony of God, the great burden of all the assemblies, he did not wish to regard it as one great idea like the pope, it was a question of love, beloved, the praying for the care of all the churches.<a name=106:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What compression in that holy man!<a name=106:11></a> I urge on you the idea of compression.<a name=106:12></a> Paul was martyred as a comparatively young man; so far as we can learn his ministry was not very long, it was like David's, it was compressed.<a name=106:13></a> Now just think, beloved, what that man's daily experience must have been, what his prayers were, what his house-to-house visiting was -- the idea of care of all the assemblies.<a name=106:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, may the Lord help us to see what the position

	<div class="paragraph">
		is, what there is to be cared for, the assembly.<a name=107:1></a> The Lord referred to it in the parable as the pearl of great price, and it says that He gave Himself for it.<a name=107:2></a> So you can understand how full the heart of our great apostle was as he set off from the elders of Ephesus.<a name=107:3></a> They are the flock of God; the Holy Spirit has made you overseers of the flock of God.<a name=107:4></a> What a charge that was!<a name=107:5></a> Then he says, "to shepherd the assembly of God, which he has purchased with the blood of his own".<a name=107:6></a> These scriptures show us what the assembly is to Him.<a name=107:7></a> Well, dear brethren, what is it to us?<a name=107:8></a> What is a local company to us?<a name=107:9></a> What are all the assemblies to us?<a name=107:10></a> We are to challenge our hearts.<a name=107:11></a> We are to be in these days on the line of caretakers, to have a sense of responsibility in regard of what is most precious to God and has the greatest place in the universe to Christ -- the assembly.<a name=107:12></a>

		DEFINITENESS IN THE THINGS OF GOD

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I had the simple desire in my mind to stress the thought of definiteness in the things of God; for the opposite is prevalent, even among those who seek to be here for the will of God.<a name=108:1></a> Indefiniteness makes for neutralisation, and neutralisation of the truth is well-nigh opposition.<a name=108:2></a> So the apostle James, in writing his epistle, speaks severely of persons who are doubting in their relationships with God, and says further, that "A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways"; there is no definiteness, whereas the word is full of definiteness, the Scriptures are full of exhortations to it.<a name=108:3></a> This leads me to select these three scriptures, the first presenting the idea in relation to instinct; the second, in relation to intelligence; and the third in relation to a definite end or objective, an enjoyment set before us as our eye looks straight on.<a name=108:4></a> You will remember how Moses in his beginnings looked "this way and that way", so with us, certain circumstances become distracting; it may be fear of consequences, fear of causing ill-feeling in others, or it may be a state in us; but there is much of looking this way and that way, and not looking straight on.<a name=108:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the first feature I had in mind in relation to definiteness was instinct, and it is a most important one, because we may have knowledge, as the apostle Paul said of the Corinthians, but knowledge in itself without instinct will fail us.<a name=108:6></a> I am not deprecating knowledge, for it is said that the people of God are destroyed for lack of it, but instinct is properly before knowledge.<a name=108:7></a> Not exactly in the order of place, but in the order of emphasis as to what is properly initial, the two things run concurrently in us.<a name=108:8></a> You

		find instinct in a babe, though you can hardly say you find knowledge, because knowledge implies that I can give an account of a thing.<a name=109:1></a> I can give a reason 'why'.<a name=109:2></a> Instinct does not go that far, but it acts with unfailing precision; and so the lower creatures are employed to symbolise instinct.<a name=109:3></a> It appears in a babe, as for instance in Jacob, who in his infancy took his brother by the heel -- that was instinct; he could not have told you why at the time, but he could later.<a name=109:4></a> And so it is with the young believer, he does things from instinct which perhaps he could hardly explain, but he can explain them afterwards.<a name=109:5></a> So the lower creatures, the milch kine in this passage, are employed to symbolise the instinct that is needed for definiteness.<a name=109:6></a> It is an ability in you to discern spirits in persons, and to discern environment, by the presence of something of which perhaps you know little, but which is there.<a name=109:7></a> For instance, a young believer in an assembly in which the Lord Jesus is known and recognised, in which the Spirit is recognised, can feel something without the intelligence to expound it, but it is felt, and he is held by that feeling.<a name=109:8></a> Now as to these milch kine, there was a something very great there in the environment; the greatest thing on earth, symbolically, was there on the cart.<a name=109:9></a> I am not speaking of the incongruity of the cart, but of the ark upon it, there is no change in that -- God was there!<a name=109:10></a> It was never less than the symbol of the glory and power of God.<a name=109:11></a> Think of being in such proximity to the ark!<a name=109:12></a> These kine were near it; they are not ordinary kine; and therefore they symbolise what I am speaking of -- spiritual instinct.<a name=109:13></a> They were productive, they had calves, they were not sterile, and they had never come under the yoke.<a name=109:14></a> These are things that marked them.<a name=109:15></a> Whilst we are under a yoke, we are not likely to come under the influence of what is spiritually outwardly cohesive.<a name=109:16></a> There is nothing for the natural eye, no direct movement, for

	<div class="paragraph">
		the ark is being carried, but if they were under a yoke, that would influence them, they would be governed by that, and would be incapable of these fine feelings and instincts.<a name=110:1></a> So that any young believer, or an old one, who is under a yoke, is hardly likely to have any sensibilities as to the ark.<a name=110:2></a> But the ark is moving in this very connection, it is moving in connection with a power that is free from the yoke, by a power that is governed by instinct.<a name=110:3></a> There is a challenge to every heart, dear brethren, as to whether I am under any kind of a yoke.<a name=110:4></a> It is very easy to slip under a yoke to which you may be obligated.<a name=110:5></a> God said to Israel, 'I have taken you out of Egypt.<a name=110:6></a> I have broken the bands of your yoke and made you to walk uprightly'.<a name=110:7></a> There cannot be a walk according to God, until the bands are broken, whatever the yoke may be.<a name=110:8></a> There is a right yoke to be under, of course, the yoke of Jesus, but I am not speaking of that, nor is it alluded to here.<a name=110:9></a> Jehovah broke the bands of their yoke and made them to walk uprightly.<a name=110:10></a> It is a challenge, dear brethren, as to what it is I am obligated to.<a name=110:11></a> It may be to a brother, or a combination of brethren, but the yoke has to go if these sensibilities are to exist.<a name=110:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, now, the thing is for us to have intelligence.<a name=112:17></a> What about the persons to whom you commit yourself?<a name=112:18></a> Christianity involves committal.<a name=112:19></a> The Lord Jesus Christ committed Himself in coming into this world, He undertook things, He committed Himself to a definite course.<a name=112:20></a> Let it be understood that in emptying Himself and taking upon Him a bondman's form it was not something imposed upon Him, it is His own act.<a name=112:21></a> He did it Himself.<a name=112:22></a> But in the bondman's

	<div class="paragraph">
		form He committed Himself to God, and served in the bondman's form.<a name=113:1></a> So that we need not be afraid of committal.<a name=113:2></a> I read two verses in Genesis to illustrate the thought; there is a great deal more in the passage than I can speak of now, but I would stress the one thing, that Jacob knew the persons to whom he committed himself.<a name=113:3></a> You say, 'I commit myself to God, and to Christ, and to the Holy Spirit'.<a name=113:4></a> Yes, that is right, you commit yourself thus in baptism.<a name=113:5></a> Baptism introduces us into the great realm of life indicated in the revelation; but then there is a committal to the saints, that is in the Lord's supper.<a name=113:6></a> This committal involves fellowship and that involves persons; and surely it is important to be able to put our hands on the right persons; it is not one person here, but two.<a name=113:7></a> That is the principle; and one has to challenge oneself as to whether he has committed himself to the right persons, and to what principles he is committed.<a name=113:8></a> Is it on the principle of nature?<a name=113:9></a> 'Well', you say, 'I cannot get a better guide than Joseph'.<a name=113:10></a> But the most reputable servant of God might fail us, even Paul might fail you.<a name=113:11></a> Joseph certainly is a wonderful type of Jesus, and a wonderful servant, too.<a name=113:12></a> The only blemish recorded is the one indicated here, but Joseph is governed by nature at this particular point, and many of us are committing ourselves to people on these principles, something in them that gives them precedence, something in the government of God that gives them prominence in one's mind.<a name=113:13></a> In Joseph's mind, as he said, Manasseh was born first; it is the principle of the world, and he is affected by it here, great man though he was.<a name=113:14></a> It is a warning to us as to committing ourselves to persons who may have something in them by the government of God.<a name=113:15></a> If we follow instinct we will not go this way, our intelligence will be in keeping with our instinct.<a name=113:16></a> "Not so, my father", these are Joseph's words -- a voice well known in Egypt for its authority.<a name=113:17></a> There

	<div class="paragraph">
		was no voice in Egypt with such authority, next to Pharaoh, but it had no weight whatever with Jacob at this point.<a name=114:1></a> Jacob was spiritual and intelligent at the moment, and Joseph was unspiritual and unintelligent.<a name=114:2></a> A rebuke and a challenge to the most distinguished of God's servants, and a warning to the saints.<a name=114:3></a> So Jacob says, "I know it, my son".<a name=114:4></a> I believe it is important to know who the persons are and why you commit yourself to them, on what principles.<a name=114:5></a> Is it on the principle of nature and what nature would value?<a name=114:6></a> Nature offers a great variety of things, but the spiritual principle is to pass by the firstborn, Manasseh is passed by, and Ephraim is selected.<a name=114:7></a> Well, that is the point I have to make on that scripture, it is a challenge as to the people with whom we are walking, and on what principles we are there.<a name=114:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the next point is found in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22">Luke  22</a>, the idea of a guide; and it will help us greatly as to the second point I have made.<a name=114:9></a> This passage in Luke will help the saints of God who are seeking the way of God; for there is the way of God in this world, though we may be defective in it.<a name=114:10></a> Even Apollos was defective in it.<a name=114:11></a> He arrived at Ephesus, and he was mighty in the Scriptures.<a name=114:12></a> He was a man whose preaching would draw crowds today, I have no doubt, but he was defective.<a name=114:13></a> He only knew the baptism of John.<a name=114:14></a> But there was more to be known, and there is a great deal to be known now, in the way of fellowship, in the way of God, and we do not want to be ignorant.<a name=114:15></a> So Priscilla and Aquila brought Apollos to them.<a name=114:16></a> There was to be a personal touch.<a name=114:17></a> They were a beautiful pair, these two, the Holy Spirit delights to dwell upon them.<a name=114:18></a> They were in Corinth in the way of God.<a name=114:19></a> They were tent-makers, and Paul associated himself with them as another tent-maker; it is the way of God.<a name=114:20></a> That is the way of God in Corinth.<a name=114:21></a> Surely we would be reminded that the way of God is
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	<div class="paragraph">
		not connected with architecture, or with great cathedrals.<a name=115:1></a> To be obscure and in rejection, is the way of God in Corinth.<a name=115:2></a> So these two can show Apollos "the way of God more exactly".<a name=115:3></a> We need to be exact when we come to the way of God.<a name=115:4></a> The way of God comes in in connection with Apollos, he was ignorant of the way of God in certain features, and Priscilla and Aquila take him to them, implying a personal touch and a link formed which would probably never be broken.<a name=115:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So this passage in Luke illustrates what I have in mind, it is entirely from the Lord's initiative.<a name=115:6></a> Luke would make externals and order important, and show furnishings; for another important thing as to committal is whether the furnishings are right, whether the order is according to God.<a name=115:7></a> And so the Lord tells them, "A man will meet you, carrying an earthen pitcher of water", <i>he</i> shall meet you.<a name=115:8></a> It is a divine provision in the ways of God.<a name=115:9></a> He is bearing a pitcher of water.<a name=115:10></a> They do not say anything, it is a question for the eye, they look straight on, that is the way he looks.<a name=115:11></a> And so as wending his way through Jerusalem, I keep my eye on him.<a name=115:12></a> It is not simply a bottle he is bearing, it is a pitcher.<a name=115:13></a> I apprehend that the water is to be for immediate use, ready to be poured out.<a name=115:14></a> It is a containing vessel, but one that can be used immediately.<a name=115:15></a> So that he typifies something I can have at once.<a name=115:16></a> It is all there ready for pouring out.<a name=115:17></a> If I am the most thirsty soul I need not wait, for it is ready.<a name=115:18></a> I look abroad in christendom today; the Lord's supper may be taken once a month or even three months, but where this man goes you get refreshment at once.<a name=115:19></a> Now the point is that this man is going along definitely, his movements are definite; that is the idea of the ministry of the Spirit.<a name=115:20></a> There is a definite end in view, and I follow my eye, I am definite, I am thinking of nothing else.<a name=115:21></a> The Lord has told me to keep my eye on that man; he may

	<div class="paragraph">
		The setting of these scriptures is in relation to a returned remnant of God's people, and I have read them because they suggest an impressionable state brought about by God, so that He is able to impress them indelibly, and to make the impressions readable.<a name=127:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I bring these scriptures forward because of the shallowness (not that I am accusing anyone) which marks those of us whom God has sovereignly brought back from Babylon.<a name=127:2></a> There is a great want of material which God can impress indelibly, and impress so as to be readable, moreover, upon which He can write, or Christ can write (for that is the way it is put in the New Testament), the very greatest things.<a name=127:3></a> He would have us to be dealing, dear brethren, in these great things, and we shall be, as heart work becomes effective.<a name=127:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so I read from Ezekiel because he has that in mind.<a name=127:5></a> If you read the chapter you will observe that he alludes to the time when God will bring back Israel, gathering them out of the nations.<a name=127:6></a> But He proposes to have them really, not merely in outward profession as of old, but real, and if God is to have us really He must have us heart-wise; there must be heart work.<a name=127:7></a> And if there is to be heart work there must be a heart other than the natural.<a name=127:8></a> God said that He would take away the heart of stone and give them instead a heart of flesh; this should be perfectly intelligible to us from the use made of it by the apostle Paul in writing to the saints in the city of Corinth, where impressions were taken on that were evidently of a shallow nature.<a name=127:9></a> Much was made of what they had externally, "in everything .<a name=127:10></a>.<a name=127:11></a>.<a name=127:12></a> enriched in him,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In doing so he formulates a sort of balance sheet, giving them all the credit he can in chapter 7 of the second epistle.<a name=128:7></a> There were many debits, but he would balance the account as much as possible by all the credits there were, and what he alludes to is heart work, repentance and tears, and vengeance against evil.<a name=128:8></a> He would balance the account.<a name=128:9></a> The Lord does these things for us so as to set our hearts at rest with Him.<a name=128:10></a> Who but He could enumerate all the credits!<a name=128:11></a> May I not say He minimises the debts and magnifies the credits.<a name=128:12></a> There was much in the way that the apostle reserves for later, for the last two chapters, the last chapter particularly.<a name=128:13></a> Terrible debits against that company.<a name=128:14></a> Let no one think that he can escape, for the Lord's vigilant eye passes over every gathering and detects where the real obligation lies.<a name=128:15></a> But it was creditable so far, and he gives them credit collectively.<a name=128:16></a> It was a matter of heart work; there was repentance according to God which was never to be repented of.<a name=128:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so he can speak of the fleshy tables of the heart upon which the writing could proceed; upon which He can use, not only the finger, but the Spirit of the living God.<a name=128:18></a> The material was such as could bear the indelible impress of the Spirit of the living God.<a name=128:19></a> And this reminds me, dear brethren, of the difference between the time of the return of the captivity and of the initial history of God's people, whether in the Old Testament or the New.<a name=128:20></a> At the outset there was broadcast testimony, as illustrated in the parable of the sower, the seed fell on different kinds of soil as found on the earth.<a name=128:21></a> As if God was testing everything on earth found in the nations, as

	<div class="paragraph">
		He did.<a name=129:1></a> Whatever there was was tested by the word, and only one soil is fruitful permanently.<a name=129:2></a> Now that is not what marks the close.<a name=129:3></a> What marks the close is not a broadcast testimony.<a name=129:4></a> There is no need again to test out the roadside, and the thorns, and the stony ground.<a name=129:5></a> That is all done.<a name=129:6></a> But the finished matter, christendom, is the testimony to that.<a name=129:7></a> We need not spend our time, dear brethren, in that.<a name=129:8></a> It is a question now of heart work, of quality, of that upon which impressions may be made by the Spirit of God that are to remain (for of what value are they if they do not remain?<a name=129:9></a>) -- and that can be read.<a name=129:10></a> They are not blurred, the very greatest things are to be read, as I hope to show.<a name=129:11></a> But God will make the best use of what there is; that is what I would specially call attention to, and I had in view the ministry of the apostle John.<a name=129:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He has a way of bringing every little bit, and every big bit, of the work of God in and making the most of it.<a name=129:13></a> It is he alone who tells us about Nicodemus.<a name=129:14></a> He was found asking questions of the Lord, and it was clear that, although he was a teacher in Israel, he did not know the ABC of spirituality.<a name=129:15></a> He came to Christ in the night, asked Him questions and listened to Him; he never showed one iota of opposition to Christ, great man though he was.<a name=129:16></a> He listened to Jesus.<a name=129:17></a> He was found in the council, his own spot; he did not give that up, but he had received some little impression of Christ and he lifted up a feeble voice, as it were, and from an unsuitable position in the council, in favour of Christ.<a name=129:18></a> And when I speak of Christ, beloved, it is what is here by the Spirit that draws out the opposition.<a name=129:19></a> Whatever little bit of Christ there is, never speak against it.<a name=129:20></a> John's ministry indicates that heaven notices that, and so Nicodemus comes in well at the end.<a name=129:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so in many other instances in John's ministry, for we have things in his record that are not found
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		elsewhere, which are just included in order that we might understand, in a time when his ministry specially revives every little bit as well as every big bit of the work of God, that all is taken account of and usable.<a name=130:1></a> We do not want to have our good evil spoken of; whatever little bit of good there is, let it be available so that it can be brought into the great writing material of God, so that He might write, and write the very greatest things upon us.<a name=130:2></a> We cannot afford to miss this, dear brethren; it is too great, too solemn to pass by.<a name=130:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so I have referred to the overcomer in Philadelphia; that is what the verse alludes to which I read.<a name=130:4></a> You will find, in confirmation of what I have said, that Paul, in his second letter to Timothy, stresses the idea of life, not public order, not that that is cancelled.<a name=130:5></a> Nothing lapses really.<a name=130:6></a> Whatever God has brought in in His precious holy thoughts is maintained in some way in spiritual power.<a name=130:7></a> So that 1 Timothy does not lapse, it stands, but what is needed to maintain it is life.<a name=130:8></a> What he stresses is life.<a name=130:9></a> He refers to it at the very outset, the promise of life he was in the hope of it indeed.<a name=130:10></a> "Which God, who cannot lie, promised before the ages of time", <a href="../bible/Titus.htm#1:2">Titus  1:2</a>.<a name=130:11></a> Life is the real thing.<a name=130:12></a> Life is never to be theoretical; it is always real.<a name=130:13></a> That is the great point with John.<a name=130:14></a> 2 Timothy links on with John's ministry, assuring the maintenance publicly of 1 Timothy in the testimony of it.<a name=130:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so in Philadelphia there is the outcome of all these things, for we have to understand the book of Revelation in its symbolical significance.<a name=130:16></a> It is a book of imagery.<a name=130:17></a> At the outset a blessing is offered to those who read and keep the things that are written.<a name=130:18></a> So that we are to understand, we cannot afford to miss the blessing.<a name=130:19></a> It would be interesting to follow up the word 'blessing' in Revelation, and see what a rich heritage there is that accrues to the

	<div class="paragraph">
		reading and understanding of the things, and to the keeping of them.<a name=131:1></a> He is an overcomer.<a name=131:2></a> One of the greatest principles of the book is overcoming, hence the additional promises of blessing that are accorded to the overcomer in the different assemblies.<a name=131:3></a> Now the most casual reader of chapters 2 and 3 will notice that the overcomer of this assembly, Philadelphia, has the greatest blessing.<a name=131:4></a> It refers to our own time, and I urge upon you, dear brethren, to be alive to this.<a name=131:5></a> Let us not miss what there is for us.<a name=131:6></a> This assembly has the only promise to the overcomer involving writing upon himself.<a name=131:7></a> The overcomer in Pergamos has a stone on which a name is written, but it is on a stone, a white one; only on the Philadelphian overcomer personally is there any writing.<a name=131:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this is a very interesting and important fact, that I should be, and you should be, material upon which the Lord Jesus can write the very greatest things.<a name=131:9></a> And this material must be heart material, not external order, not mere intelligence.<a name=131:10></a> Writing is not in the head.<a name=131:11></a> I mean it is on the person, on him.<a name=131:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What a man he must be!<a name=131:13></a> What a person he must be!<a name=131:14></a> On him that overcomes, said the Lord, "I will write upon him the name of my God".<a name=131:15></a> If we understand that spiritually we shall see that writing involves a moral process spiritually.<a name=131:16></a> God will use what there is and make the very most of it.<a name=131:17></a> I have no doubt that is what is meant in regard to the first tables; they were made by Himself and the best He could get.<a name=131:18></a> And the writing is by Himself, and that is perfect.<a name=131:19></a> But they were breakable, and they were broken.<a name=131:20></a> He used what was there, a solemn reference to the state of man as he was then.<a name=131:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second tables were hewn out by Moses, typically this indicates that the Lord Jesus came in in principle in the meantime and He had material that would be unbreakable.<a name=131:22></a> And that is so; the second writing is typical of the Lord Jesus.<a name=131:23></a> And so

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=132>[Page 132]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Moses hews them out himself, bringing them up the mount.<a name=132:1></a> Can we not see, dear brethren, what the Lord Jesus has done in hewing out the tables Himself and bringing them up, so to speak?<a name=132:2></a> And then there is an ark of wood so that they can be contained.<a name=132:3></a> But God said, 'I will write exactly what I want', but the material is the sign of the Mediator, that is Christ as a Man.<a name=132:4></a> And at the end of this book of Revelation He Himself is written upon (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#19:16">Revelation  19:16</a>).<a name=132:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		He would honour us by putting us upon that platform, the platform of impressionable material upon which God can write by His Spirit.<a name=132:6></a> So that the writing is obviously a moral process and that must be heart work.<a name=132:7></a> Hence Jeremiah tells us by the Spirit from the mouth of God that He would, in the new covenant, put His law in their inward parts.<a name=132:8></a> You cannot limit inward parts.<a name=132:9></a> Who knows the inward parts but God?<a name=132:10></a> He has made us, wonderfully made us; we have been curiously formed in the lowest parts of the earth.<a name=132:11></a> He knows every crevice of the inner parts.<a name=132:12></a> So that God can unqualifiedly put His law in there without any fear of it being damaged or adulterated.<a name=132:13></a> It is inner work that God is after now, and we do not want to miss it.<a name=132:14></a> "I will put my law in their inward parts", <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#31:33">Jeremiah  31:33</a>.<a name=132:15></a> Very much like the Lord, He put it in there Himself, and magnified it, and made it honourable.<a name=132:16></a> He was the true ark of the covenant.<a name=132:17></a> The idea is trustworthiness, involving protection, and magnification indeed of the law, so that it did not become a dead letter.<a name=132:18></a> It was made a living reality in Christ.<a name=132:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now we are brought to correspondence with that, even in a higher way than Jeremiah speaks, for the Spirit of God sheds abroad the love of God in our hearts.<a name=132:20></a> The inner parts are taken possession of in a most blessed way.<a name=132:21></a> There is no retrogression at all with the living God taking possession of the inner parts.<a name=132:22></a> "The path of the just is as the shining light,

		John understands that when the Lord says to Nicodemus, "Ye must be born again".<a name=133:7></a> You must be born throughout, the whole man has to be dealt with radically.<a name=133:8></a> Otherwise there could be no material upon which God, Christ, can write the very greatest things.<a name=133:9></a> The overcomer in Philadelphia is a man who has gone in for things.<a name=133:10></a> God has brought wonderful things to light in our time.<a name=133:11></a> How are we dealing with these things, what use are we making of them?<a name=133:12></a> We have wonderful writings, but that is not the idea of material.<a name=133:13></a> The best paper made will moulder and disappear, but not the material that I am speaking of.<a name=133:14></a> We may take the light of God in a shallow sort of way, but light will not always stand by me; I need heart work, and food, too, for constitution.<a name=133:15></a> And the overcomer in Philadelphia has gone in for these things, wonderful things.<a name=133:16></a> And the overcomer is not going to let one thing lapse, he will say everything is for him.<a name=133:17></a> It is the inheritance of the assembly.<a name=133:18></a>

		Chapters 21 to 23 show our circumstances down here, but this chapter is the going up; it challenges our hearts as to whether we are prepared to go up In going through difficulties here we will be tested; we have to deal with all these things, but it will not always be so, nor is it always so now; there is an exit from that, but it all has to be faced.<a name=156:3></a> Love in the Hebrew servant faces all such difficulties -- love in one that has had the ear bored and could have gone out free can face all difficulties.<a name=156:4></a> The committal in regard of the difficulties is more connected with the position in Romans -- it is the adjusting; everything is adjusted here before we can think of offering.<a name=156:5></a> The whole of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#119">Psalm  119</a>is the experience of a man devoted to the commandments of the Lord; and then in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#120">Psalm  120</a>and onwards there are those who will ascend!<a name=156:6></a> We may as well face these matters if we are to ascend -- all moral affairs have to be adjusted.<a name=156:7></a> Obeying from the heart, as in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>.<a name=156:8></a> is in regard to the difficulties which have to be faced down here.<a name=156:9></a> It is obeying <i>from the heart</i>; there must be committal to what God proposes.<a name=156:10></a> The chapter is full of God's proposals, and the committal, on the ground of adjustment here, enables us to take it on.<a name=156:11></a> God is free to take us on, on that ground, too.<a name=156:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Unity in connection with the twelve pillars is an important side of the position, obviously.<a name=157:11></a> It comes in after the altar.<a name=157:12></a> Unity follows the acceptance of the covenant because it involves the love of God in our hearts, and where that exists we have the basis of unity, not simply unity as in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12">Romans  12</a>where we are one body in Christ but unity in affection.<a name=157:13></a> One body in Christ is simply to show that we are not a body in the sense of freemasonry or Rechabitism, but that we are one body in <i>Christ</i>, and what underlies that is that we all have the love of God shed abroad in our hearts.<a name=157:14></a>

		<i>called</i> that.<a name=167:1></a> In the gospel of John we have title to take that place as before God, and before men, too; but in the epistle we are called that, and that is the manner of the love.<a name=167:2></a> The children of God are also the brethren; not here the brethren of Christ, that is not the point, but the brethren, persons of that distinction.<a name=167:3></a> The very great fact that there are such, dear brethren, and their prominence and importance, their quality, are indicated in the fact that as loving them we know that we have passed out of death into life.<a name=167:4></a> Any of us here who does not love the brethren, does not know that!<a name=167:5></a> We may speak of it, and quote the Lord's words that "he that hears my word, and believes him that has sent me, has life eternal, and does not come into judgment, but is passed out of death into life", <a href="../bible/John.htm#5:24">John  5:24</a>.<a name=167:6></a> We may quote that, but that does not give me consciousness of the transition, of having passed out of death into life; whereas love for the brethren <i>does</i>.<a name=167:7></a> Hereby "<i>We</i> know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren".<a name=167:8></a> Not the persons we meet in society, not our relatives after the flesh, but the brethren, these people.<a name=167:9></a> Other scriptures show us what they are, what marks them, but this scripture assumes that they are known, "the brethren".<a name=167:10></a>

		Peter tells us to "love the brotherhood", which would mean the same persons only in other conditions, like the Jews, of which I hope to speak presently, who banded themselves together in the province of Ahasuerus, against their enemies; they could not be withstood.<a name=167:11></a> So that there should be no fear with such a people.<a name=167:12></a> If we view them as the brethren, we view them in family relations and affection.<a name=167:13></a> If we view them as the brotherhood, they are irresistible -- they cannot be overcome.<a name=167:14></a> So being amongst them, and loving them, is the position we covet -- it is a state and condition to be coveted -- to love them and be of them.<a name=167:15></a>

		Well now, I want to show from Esther how this works out, how in loving them and laying down our lives for them, we are promoted spiritually.<a name=168:1></a> Promotion spiritually is an aspiration to be encouraged, would there were more of it, and less aspiration of material promotion!<a name=168:2></a> They do not go together, beloved; one destroys the other.<a name=168:3></a> So that John  tells the one to whom he writes the second letter, that he wishes that he should prosper and be in health as his soul prospereth.<a name=168:4></a> An excellent balance!<a name=168:5></a> Any material prosperity is detrimental, and is material upon which the enemy will not fail to act to our detriment.<a name=168:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now as I said, I want to show from Esther how this works out.<a name=168:7></a> How love for the brethren, and martyrdom, if need be, for them, involve spiritual promotion.<a name=168:8></a> So I refer to the word "Jew" in this book as suggestive of the brethren in reproach, for they are in reproach if they are truly in the state and position of brethren.<a name=168:9></a> The world knows us not as children, and we are not to marvel if it hates us; it hated God, it hated the Father and the Son -- such is the world.<a name=168:10></a> It is futile to dwell on the inconsistency of hating us without a cause, it is waste of time; the flesh will ever hate us without a cause, even in persons known to be christians.<a name=168:11></a> It considers not consistency at all.<a name=168:12></a> So the Lord says, "They hated me without a cause".<a name=168:13></a> We are not to marvel about the hatred.<a name=168:14></a> It implies that we are 'Jews'.<a name=168:15></a> As the word 'Hebrew' in Exodus signifies the reproach of Christ attaching to His people, so the word 'Jew' in Esther signifies the same in other, although very similar, circumstances.<a name=168:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So I take up the idea of the 'Jew' in Esther as denoting this feature.<a name=168:17></a> According to Romans the apostle says the Jew is not a Jew who is one outwardly in the flesh, but he is a Jew who is so inwardly, in spirit, whose praise is of God and not of men.<a name=168:18></a> Circumcision is in the spirit, it is a spiritual idea, it

		<a name=169>[Page 169]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		is a Colossian idea.<a name=169:1></a> There are those who say they are Jews and are not; but there are those who <i>are</i>.<a name=169:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord deals with those who are not; they lie, they are of the synagogue of Satan; He says to Philadelphia, "Behold, I make them of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews, and are not, but lie; behold, I will cause that they shall come and shall do homage before thy feet, and shall know that I have loved thee", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:9">Revelation  3:9</a>.<a name=169:3></a> Notice that: "before thy feet".<a name=169:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus the Jew in Esther is the believer in reproach.<a name=169:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mordecai is said to be a Jew.<a name=169:6></a> He was in the palace, he was there in the government of God; his genealogy is given so that we might know that he had a pedigree although in the palace of Shushan.<a name=169:7></a> We are told that he was a Jew, and that he had a pedigree, and then we are told that he was a man of family affections.<a name=169:8></a> A great feature in John's ministry is family affection.<a name=169:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So that he had such family affection as led to sacrifice; he took Esther up as his daughter -- his cousin as we speak -- evidently much younger, but in an unselfish, family way, he took her as his own daughter -- a very tender way to take up those who are parentless.<a name=169:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is Mordecai the Jew, that is to say he is that, he represents that in a very positive and full way.<a name=169:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'Mordecai the <i>Jew</i>', that is to say, a brother marked by family affection and unselfishness.<a name=169:12></a> I do not mean natural family affection brought into the house of God; Nehemiah calls that "household stuff".<a name=169:13></a> That is not Mordecai at all.<a name=169:14></a> He is 'Mordecai the <i>Jew</i>', a sufferer in reproach.<a name=169:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, I have read to you Haman's description of the brethren.<a name=169:16></a> It is not <i>heaven's</i> description of them, it is Haman's description, but he is forced to say some things that are true.<a name=169:17></a> There can be no mistake as to who these people are, our enemies themselves being judges; there is something there that is distinctive.<a name=169:18></a> Haman would have them

	<div class="paragraph">
		destroyed, and was almost successful in his efforts, but there was Mordecai the Jew, a man who takes his life in his hands for the brethren, and the result is that Haman goes down and Mordecai goes up!<a name=170:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is no God in sight in this book; even prayer is not mentioned in this book, and yet there is a most wonderful evidence of divine working!<a name=170:2></a> One of the most striking features of the book is seemliness, that is to say, God is not brought in where the circumstances of His people are dishonouring.<a name=170:3></a> We speak to Him, of course, we seek Him, of course, but make no parade of a God in such circumstances.<a name=170:4></a> The circumstances deny Him, as though He were asleep, and truly He was in figure, as when the ark was in the Philistine land, when it says, He "awoke as one out of sleep", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#78:65">Psalm  78:65</a>.<a name=170:5></a> But there is not a word of that in Esther.<a name=170:6></a> God never actually sleeps: "he that keepeth Israel will neither slumber nor sleep", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#121:4">Psalm  121:4</a>.<a name=170:7></a> He is ever vigilant, but He knows how to keep out of sight, and those who love Him know how to keep Him out of sight too, if the circumstances are dishonouring.<a name=170:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So Haman apparently was successful in his efforts, but Mordecai the Jew stands out when he heard of the awful disaster that was pending on the brethren.<a name=170:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Are there not some here that know something of brethren's disasters?<a name=170:10></a> There are!<a name=170:11></a> Some of us, many of us, here do not know war; God would teach us war, it is one of the features of our education.<a name=170:12></a> As the psalmist says, He "teacheth my hands to war, my fingers to fight", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#144:1">Psalm  144:1</a>.<a name=170:13></a> The disasters of our brethren are most sorrowful, but this is a threatened disaster, one that never occurred!<a name=170:14></a> Often God allows things to come so near that we gain by them just as if we had passed through them.<a name=170:15></a> It is His way.<a name=170:16></a> If He brings things into evidence as pending, it is well to go through them anticipatively.<a name=170:17></a> We gain the

		lesson and the sorrow never occurs!<a name=171:1></a> Such is our God!<a name=171:2></a> Such is the school of our God!<a name=171:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So Mordecai hears of the decision of the king, and he puts on sackcloth and cries with a loud and bitter cry.<a name=171:4></a> Where does he cry?<a name=171:5></a> In his own house?<a name=171:6></a> No, it does not say that; he cries in the city, in the gates of the king.<a name=171:7></a> He put his life in his hand when he might have shielded himself and shirked his responsibility; he took his life in his hand and garbed himself in sackcloth and cried.<a name=171:8></a> It is a very solemn matter, beloved brethren, as to our relations to the brethren, what they are worth to us; are they worth laying down our lives for them?<a name=171:9></a> I know what they were worth to Jesus; He laid down His life.<a name=171:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, I want to show you that in thus taking up this attitude, we lead others on.<a name=171:11></a> That is one great feature in christianity, the feature of leadership and influence.<a name=171:12></a> We do not want to go alone, we want to carry the brethren.<a name=171:13></a> If we love them we do not wish them to miss anything, if there is promotion we do not wish them to miss it.<a name=171:14></a> There is plenty to do, you know!<a name=171:15></a> Belshazzar would have Daniel understand that he could promote him, but Daniel said, "Let thy gifts be to thyself".<a name=171:16></a> There are plenty of them with God!<a name=171:17></a> He can promote, He has honours of His own to bestow, and we do not wish the brethren to miss them.<a name=171:18></a> The apostle Paul spoke about a crown of righteousness that was laid up for him, and not only for him, but for all who love the appearing of Jesus.<a name=171:19></a> It is not the rapture, as we say, but the appearing; "all who love his appearing", <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#4">2 Timothy  4</a>S.<a name=171:20></a> So we do not want the brethren to miss anything.<a name=171:21></a> There is great promotion ahead.<a name=171:22></a> Esther was queen, but on sufferance, a poor position!<a name=171:23></a> We do not want a position like that.<a name=171:24></a> I am not disparaging her place, it was under the government of God, but she was consciously on sufferance, on a sandy foundation!<a name=171:25></a> Mordecai would lead her on further.<a name=171:26></a> She would

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=172>[Page 172]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		seek to modify the reproach, which is always evident in unspiritual or half-hearted people amongst us.<a name=172:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		She would say, Do not be so extreme, do not wear sackcloth, do not put ashes upon your head!<a name=172:2></a> She could afford to wear other clothes; I do not suppose she had any sackcloth in her wardrobe.<a name=172:3></a> I wonder if the sisters keep sackcloth in their wardrobe?<a name=172:4></a> Mordecai had it, apparently, but Esther sent other raiment; she would have him take off the sackcloth and wear other clothes.<a name=172:5></a> She would defeat the whole position in the book.<a name=172:6></a> It shows what half-hearted people are, persons who do not go all the way.<a name=172:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But Esther was not immune from the influence of a spiritual man.<a name=172:8></a> "A brother is born for adversity".<a name=172:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How admirable is his message to her, for she was only a Jewess.<a name=172:10></a> It was her glory, although concealed for the moment; like many of us she concealed that which was her true glory, and put on something else; that is of no honour at all, it is degrading spiritually.<a name=172:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Mordecai says, Do not think that you will escape; who knows but that you are raised up for this very purpose; and mark you, if you do not act, somebody else will.<a name=172:12></a> God is not bound to act through you, but it is your privilege.<a name=172:13></a> He may have to get somebody else, but He appeals to you.<a name=172:14></a> Is your place in court of any value if the brethren are destroyed Where will you be?<a name=172:15></a> Will you be content to be alone in court, in your social relations?<a name=172:16></a> Can you get along without the brethren?<a name=172:17></a> Somebody else will come forward if you do not.<a name=172:18></a> Mordecai says, Will you shirk your responsibility?<a name=172:19></a> It is an appeal to come forward and identify ourselves with the brethren in their reproach -- whatever it may involve, even the cost of our lives.<a name=172:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Esther understood, she sent back word, she was not blind to the fact that it did mean possibly her life, "If I perish, I perish", she says; and she begged Mordecai and his companions to fast with her and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=173>[Page 173]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		her maidens for three days.<a name=173:1></a> You see the seemliness, the comeliness of this woman; she says nothing about prayer.<a name=173:2></a> Can we doubt that she understood the word?<a name=173:3></a> Doubtless she did, but they all had such a sense of the reproach, and how God was dishonoured by the whole position that they were secret in regard of God.<a name=173:4></a> They understood the mystery -- becomingly!<a name=173:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So she takes her life into her hands and goes into the court of the king's palace, and is accepted.<a name=173:6></a> She went the right way, she went the way of death, beloved; there is no other way; both she and Mordecai went through death in their spirits -- laying "down our lives for the brethren".<a name=173:7></a> Well, the result shows that the movement was successful.<a name=173:8></a> I do not go over that; you are no doubt conversant with the history of Mordecai, but what I want to show now is the promotion.<a name=173:9></a> Do not think that it is not worth something; it is, beloved.<a name=173:10></a> Divine promotion is to be desired.<a name=173:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So in the last chapter you have Mordecai's promotion, but in the previous chapter Esther stands out peculiarly.<a name=173:12></a> She does not lose her queen-ship, she remains queen; it was hers under the government of God, and she adorns the position in a moral sense; she lays down her life for the brethren.<a name=173:13></a> What comes out in chapter 9 is the establishment of a great feast among the people of God.<a name=173:14></a> This is something to be noted, for every divine movement, every divine deliverance of the people of God, establishes a landmark.<a name=173:15></a> How great a thing it is to have part in a divine landmark!<a name=173:16></a> Those of us who have been through things understand what landmarks are.<a name=173:17></a> There are the ancient landmarks, without saying who set them up, that are not to be removed, they are all to stand; they represent the cumulative effect of the testimony, and they stand in the souls of the spiritual.<a name=173:18></a> There are the ancient ones, and then there are the ones that are afterwards set up; these are most interesting.<a name=173:19></a> The great outstanding epochs in the history of God's

	<div class="paragraph">
		service are not to be removed.<a name=174:1></a> We should challenge our hearts if we appear to set aside anything that God has given, and be careful as to what we may think is not divinely given, for we must not move the landmarks of our fathers; they refer to great spiritual epochs and the outstanding results of the assembly.<a name=174:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We know what the world makes of ancient things the world is dotted with symbols of these unhallowed things; the whole world is dotted with memorials.<a name=174:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I only refer to that to explain.<a name=174:4></a> Are there any spiritual ones?<a name=174:5></a> There are; they are most interesting.<a name=174:6></a> They are not to be interfered with; they represent what is cumulative.<a name=174:7></a> What we want is to establish a land mark, not to set up something for our own distinction; it is the outcome, the inevitable result, of an exploit.<a name=174:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So a feast is set up by the decree of Mordecai and Esther; on the fourteenth and fifteenth days they rested and made them days of feasting and joy.<a name=174:9></a> So it was established that they should keep the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Adar yearly, "the month that was turned to them from sorrow to joy; and from mourning into a good day", a disaster that turned to a most signal victory!<a name=174:10></a> That is a landmark!<a name=174:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is added to the many that have gone before.<a name=174:12></a> How great an honour it is to have part in the establishment of a landmark!<a name=174:13></a> Who has part in it?<a name=174:14></a> Those who love the brethren, those who lay down their lives for the brethren!<a name=174:15></a> How great an honour!<a name=174:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we come to the last chapter; Esther is not mentioned, Mordecai is the great feature of the book.<a name=174:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He has established his promotion, next to the king; he has reached that position on moral grounds, a wonderful spirit of devotedness, may we cherish it more!<a name=174:18></a> He is great amongst the Jews, amongst the despised people; a thousand times greater than to be great amongst the people of this world, which is what most aspire to.<a name=174:19></a> The less the heart aspires to, the better; a name in this world, a little bit of glory

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So Mordecai is great amongst the Jews, and accepted of all his brethren; he served them well; he laid down his life for them.<a name=175:9></a> Well they might think him great and acceptable!<a name=175:10></a> But now they are <i>his</i> brethren -- not simply <i>the</i> brethren, they are <i>his</i>!<a name=175:11></a> They formed themselves into a band and no one could withstand them; that was the brotherhood.<a name=175:12></a> But now they are <i>his</i> brethren, belonging to him in family relations, and he is acceptable to them all.<a name=175:13></a> What a great thing that is!<a name=175:14></a> There is no doubt that such devotedness brings about acceptance among the brethren.<a name=175:15></a> If one is not acceptable among the brethren, it is very likely he has not laid down his life!<a name=175:16></a> We do not want to be men like Absalom who had no male seed, who would erect a monument to himself, a poor thing!<a name=175:17></a> Mordecai has seed, and he speaks peace to them; he passes on peace -- like Jesus, "Peace unto you".<a name=175:18></a> There is participation in that, "I leave peace with you; I give my peace to you", <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:27">John  14:27</a>.<a name=175:19></a> The Lord bless His word.<a name=175:20></a>

		I wish to speak about 'appropriation', a word commonly used amongst the people of God, the full significance of which as applying to what is presented as food by God to us is but poorly appreciated or, at least, has but little taken hold on us.<a name=193:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Eating is the best figure we get of the idea of appropriation because eating implies that I not only take things, but use them in such wise that they become entirely effective, according to their intent.<a name=193:2></a> What is eaten affords the necessary strength and thus is effective.<a name=193:3></a> Ordinarily the animal creation is bound to feed if it is to exist at all.<a name=193:4></a> No doubt the same principle applies to the vegetable creation, but it certainly does to the animal creation.<a name=193:5></a> We are so constituted that we must have food and eat it.<a name=193:6></a> The possession of food is not enough; it has to be appropriated.<a name=193:7></a> So in the bounty of the Creator, in Genesis, food is made plentiful; man could eat if he liked but, on the other hand, he was forbidden to eat certain fruit.<a name=193:8></a> Generally, however, food was there and in abundance.<a name=193:9></a> The first chapter of Genesis describes the food that God had provided for man and also for the beast of the field, but it is left to man to appropriate the food provided for him, and ordinarily he would do so as otherwise subsistence would be impossible.<a name=193:10></a> It was, of course, vegetable food, God taking account of man's constitution and of that of the cattle, so that flesh was not provided at the outset.<a name=193:11></a> From the facts presented, it is evident that the food provided suited man's constitution at that time.<a name=193:12></a> Later flesh was provided for man but there is nothing said about its being provided for the cattle although, doubtless,

		carnivorous appetites had already developed -- they certainly developed later on -- but flesh is allowed formally to man.<a name=194:1></a> As I said, however, there is no special injunction that the food should be eaten; that is left but, when we come to Exodus, there is a special injunction.<a name=194:2></a> That book, having in mind, as we have already noticed, that God would be in covenant relation with His people and that His name would be bound up with them, that His very glory should be in their midst, that, indeed, He Himself should dwell in their midst, a constitution becomes of importance and hence suitable food.<a name=194:3></a> So in Exodus God prescribes food, which I do not need to go into now, save to mention the passover.<a name=194:4></a> That has a great bearing on the subject.<a name=194:5></a> If people are to be in relation with God, they must not only learn to judge righteously in everyday affairs as men do, more or less, but to judge of sin according to God.<a name=194:6></a> In truth we have to learn everything from God and especially how to judge sin, so that He introduces the passover lamb.<a name=194:7></a> It was to be a yearling as you will remember, meaning that it was of growth, developed, and that it should be before the Israelites objectively in their houses so that they should learn to value it and that, whilst it was going to be food for them, it was not, in itself, deserving of death or sufferings.<a name=194:8></a> So that in slaying it they were to understand that the penalty was attached not to the lamb but to themselves.<a name=194:9></a>

		I am saying what is simple to most of you but my object is to bring out first the kind of food that God prescribed and then that it should be eaten and nothing left over to the morning and what was left should be burned by fire.<a name=194:10></a> It was to be eaten at a particular time and family-wise, so that in the houses of the Israelites constitutions should be built up on the principle of sin judged vicariously.<a name=194:11></a> Not simply that man should die, according to Genesis, "the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die", but

		that there should be vicarious death and that that should afford food.<a name=195:1></a> And it was imperative that that food should be eaten.<a name=195:2></a> The people were to understand how their constitution was built up on the principle of food provided vicariously; they were to understand that a penalty had come in but, nevertheless, they subsisted.<a name=195:3></a> God intended to have these people all round His dwelling, to dwell in their midst, their very constitutions being in accord with Himself.<a name=195:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is the idea, so I take that up as the principle governing what I have in mind; food not only provided but prescribed and enjoined to be eaten.<a name=195:5></a> Any Israelite could feed freely while ever afterwards anyone failing to feed on this food would be cut off.<a name=195:6></a> Other kinds of food would be added, such as the manna, but this food was imperative for every Israelite.<a name=195:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to apply this to what I want to say in regard to food in the book of the Revelation, a book which has a peculiar bearing on the present time.<a name=195:8></a> The understanding of this book requires much consideration but especially that we turn to see the voice, not only to hear, but to <i>see</i> the voice.<a name=195:9></a> The voice is behind and the one by whom it was intended to be heard turned to see it and he described what he saw, a wonderful vision.<a name=195:10></a> He is ordered here, in chapter 10, to take the little book and eat it up, cover as well, so to speak, meaning that none of it was to be omitted, for we are very apt to discriminate, but the word here is to take the little book and eat it up.<a name=195:11></a> I bring in this scripture first because it conveys the principle that, unless this injunction is acted upon, we shall not prophesy again.<a name=195:12></a> We shall not go forward, and the Lord will take on others.<a name=195:13></a> When I say prophesy again, I mean that whatever our position is, whatever our privilege that is accorded to us, unless this principle is accepted, we shall be left.<a name=195:14></a> Therefore it is for each one, in the face of this scripture,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will observe that there is the thought of smallness in these scriptures.<a name=311:1></a> In the first incident God is calling attention to it, and in the second, His servant Amos is calling God's attention to the smallness of Jacob.<a name=311:2></a> My remarks will centre around these scriptures, which call forth much in the way of a general principle in relation to God's ways and dealings with us: how He dissipates all natural thoughts at the roots.<a name=311:3></a> We are told to be natural, to think naturally, speak naturally, but God ever sets Himself against the natural in His sphere of things.<a name=311:4></a> Indeed He says the natural man understands not the things of the Spirit they are foolishness to him.<a name=311:5></a> He may seek to accommodate himself to them, but finally they are foolishness to him.<a name=311:6></a> And unless he is subject to God, he refutes them entirely.<a name=311:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God knows that, and from the outset He would dissipate what is natural: and one of the natural tendencies is the desire for bigness in the things of God.<a name=311:8></a> It is perfectly normal in the world, this desire for bigness.<a name=311:9></a> It shone out at Shinar as we remember, when they set about to build a city and a tower, the top of which would reach to heaven.<a name=311:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That was natural, and we might say normal in this world out of which God had been eliminated.<a name=311:11></a> They did not like to retain Him in their knowledge: they eliminated God from their calculations.<a name=311:12></a> So the outcome was that they would have something big.<a name=311:13></a> It comes right down to us, it is seen everywhere.<a name=311:14></a> Huge buildings, hospitals, cities, ships.<a name=311:15></a> Bigness is a feature, and will be while the world lasts as it is.<a name=311:16></a> "Is not this great Babylon, that I have built?<a name=311:17></a>" says Nebuchadnezzar.<a name=311:18></a>

		God at the beginning would dissipate all that from the hearts of His people.<a name=312:1></a> He called Abraham out of that, and as called out, He refers back to him, to Isaac and Jacob in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#105">Psalm  105</a>.<a name=312:2></a> They were few and of little account, and they went from one kingdom to another people.<a name=312:3></a> But God says in this verse (<a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#7:7">Deuteronomy  7:7</a>) referring to them, "Not because ye were more in number than all the peoples, hath Jehovah been attached to you and chosen you, for ye are the fewest of all the peoples".<a name=312:4></a>

		From these remarks, someone might think that smallness is a virtue.<a name=312:5></a> But it may not be a virtue; it may be the result of laziness; want of industry maybe, and that is not a virtue.<a name=312:6></a> But smallness on account of quality, because of refusing to take on the spirit of the world; smallness on account of non-absorption with the world is a virtue.<a name=312:7></a>

		Now in Amos this is taken up when Israel had been enlarged and again become small under the government of God.<a name=315:9></a> It is one thing to be small in our beginnings, as when Abram was called out, but it is another thing to be small under the government of God.<a name=315:10></a> Why are we so small?<a name=315:11></a> Why are there not more converts?<a name=315:12></a> That is a question for the heart, and Amos was observant as to it.<a name=315:13></a> We should not sit down and fold our hands, assuming that it is so and cannot be otherwise.<a name=315:14></a> It can be otherwise.<a name=315:15></a> That is what this chapter brings out, and Amos understood in effect.<a name=315:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So we find that He shows Amos the pending calamity.<a name=316:4></a> It says, "Thus did the Lord Jehovah chew unto me; and behold, he formed locusts in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth, and behold, it was the latter growth after the king's mowings".<a name=316:5></a> Now this had not happened yet, and it never did happen, thank God.<a name=316:6></a> It was a vision of pending happening which God repented of.<a name=316:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And so He reveals to Amos the pending calamity.<a name=316:15></a> He formed the grasshoppers Himself.<a name=316:16></a> We most of us know the disastrous effect of a plague of locusts.<a name=316:17></a> They eat up everything.<a name=316:18></a> So God can use the most insignificant creatures to carry out the most serious judgments.<a name=316:19></a> That is what God can do.<a name=316:20></a> Scientific men can tell us a good deal about the locusts, but God can use these insignificant creatures to carry out His judgment.<a name=316:21></a> It is to call attention to the immensity of His instrumentalities.<a name=316:22></a>

		I have the house of God in mind in reading these scriptures, especially to show how it is in His mind in all the discipline and judicial dealings with His people.<a name=321:1></a> The outcome of every discipline, whether great or small, has the house in view.<a name=321:2></a> So that definite gain accrues to us, and definite gain accrues to God as the outcome of every discipline, whether great or small.<a name=321:3></a> There is discipline which may be classified as small, and which we are apt to overlook because of its smallness, but it fits in with the divine scheme, and is not to be overlooked, but is to be regarded in the light of the general education through which God passes His people.<a name=321:4></a> He has a very great school and He has had many pupils in it; beginning with Adam it comes down in history to when the last saint is perfected.<a name=321:5></a> For God's school brings out perfect scholars.<a name=321:6></a> To"present every man perfect in Christ"; God is never satisfied with anything short of perfection.<a name=321:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We find that in the first chapter of Genesis God worked by the day.<a name=321:8></a> It is a wonderful thought that the Creator Himself should come into each day of the week and do the day's work for six days.<a name=321:9></a> But every day's work was perfect in itself; and that would be expanded to every subject of His education.<a name=321:10></a> His intent is to turn out perfect scholars in view of the world He has in mind, and which has already taken form, so that each may fill his place in it, acceptably to God, and in relation to Christ, in whom every perfection is seen.<a name=321:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this school God has been pleased to bring into prominence certain persons as examples.<a name=322:2></a> Amongst these are David; he stands out very definitely as one whom God sets before us as a model product of His educational dealings.<a name=322:3></a> Then we have such a man as Jacob, another outstanding example, also Moses.<a name=322:4></a> Then in the New Testament there are Peter and Paul.<a name=322:5></a> These are the most outstanding in the New Testament; but each is to be considered by us as a special example in the school of God.<a name=322:6></a> So that we may not falter when under discipline but rather be encouraged, for it is not hatred in God, but love that brings it about.<a name=322:7></a> So we are taught in this regard in the school of Tyrannus.<a name=322:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You might say, 'I should not like to be in that school; that of a man whose name means tyrant'.<a name=322:9></a> Children do not care for tyrants as teachers; but the principle of the tyrant is most essential to the school.<a name=322:10></a> That is to say, a school primarily implies that one will must rule, and not that of every child in it.<a name=322:11></a> One will must rule us because it is a question of love.<a name=322:12></a> And we see in the result that all things work together for good to those who love God, and those who are called according to His purpose.<a name=322:13></a> We learn that and say it with great zest at the end, and look back on the path as we get older and say, 'I would not have been without it.<a name=322:14></a> It was very hard at the time, but it had its own part in my education, and I would not have been without it'.<a name=322:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In 2 Samuel we are told that God moved David to number the people, but in this chapter Satan moved him.<a name=323:8></a> It was the malice of the devil; but from the wider viewpoint God controlled the malice of the devil and allowed him to influence David.<a name=323:9></a> We might think that God would have shielded him, but He did not; He allowed the devil to suggest to David that he should number the people, as though he were one of the monarchs of the world, like Caesar Augustus.<a name=323:10></a> We are told that the object of a monarch making a census is to find out how many subjects he has.<a name=323:11></a> God does not like that: He numbers His people, but as soon as we begin to number those who are in fellowship and seek to have a large meeting, God does not like that.<a name=323:12></a> Not that He would disparage the numbers, but the motive to have numbers and priding ourselves religiously in a large congregation, God does not like.<a name=323:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		David numbered the people, and they were a goodly number, because populations of kingdoms were not as they are now.<a name=323:14></a> We would be surprised if we compared the population of those days with that of the present time, how few they were.<a name=323:15></a> So David's kingdom was relatively large according to the census taken here, and it says God was not pleased.<a name=323:16></a> It is a very solemn thing to have a sense that something has happened in my life that has displeased God.<a name=323:17></a> He is slow to anger and has much patience with us, but certain things happen that do displease Him.<a name=323:18></a> Especially is He displeased by pride, which was behind this proposal of David's.<a name=323:19></a>

		His pleasure.<a name=324:1></a> How great is the difference!<a name=324:2></a> The difference, for instance, in the life of Jesus, when God opened the heavens and spoke to Him and said, "<i>Thou</i> art my beloved Son".<a name=324:3></a> He spoke to Him directly according to some of the gospels, and of Him in others, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight".<a name=324:4></a> What pleasure it must have given the heart of Jesus!<a name=324:5></a> He knew it; there never was a shadow between the Father and the Son.<a name=324:6></a> Infinite delight was always in the heart of the Father as He looked upon His Son here in manhood.<a name=324:7></a> He told Him He had delight in Him.<a name=324:8></a> "<i>Thou</i> art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight".<a name=324:9></a> And synchronising with that, the Holy Spirit came down in bodily form as a dove, which would mean that the totality of the Spirit was there, all that God is, resting on that blessed Man.<a name=324:10></a> He abode on Him, it is said.<a name=324:11></a> Think of that!<a name=324:12></a> And it is to be thought of.<a name=324:13></a> We should tell of these facts in the gospel.<a name=324:14></a> Then when God expresses His displeasure in that same Person, we do not take it in much; the immensity of the contrast!<a name=324:15></a> On the one hand His infinite pleasure and on the other His infinite displeasure.<a name=324:16></a> The reconciliation of these two facts is, that in the one instance it is the Lord personally, and in the other, the Lord is representing us in all our hideous guilt.<a name=324:17></a> He was there as representative of us, and that is what brought forth God's displeasure.<a name=324:18></a> The Lord had to say to God, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?<a name=324:19></a>" There is food for the soul in considering the contrast.<a name=324:20></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So with David; God was greatly pleased with him.<a name=325:2></a> He was very displeased with Saul, He rejected him.<a name=325:3></a> Samuel would have retained Saul, and mourned for him, and Jehovah says, "How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him?<a name=325:4></a>" Why should I be out of accord with God?<a name=325:5></a> But then Samuel is sent to the house of Jesse the Bethlehemite, for Jehovah says, "I have provided me a king among his sons".<a name=325:6></a> So Samuel went from Bethlehem and the sons of Jesse are caused to pass before him, from the eldest to the youngest.<a name=325:7></a> Eliab comes first and Samuel says, "Surely Jehovah's anointed is before him".<a name=325:8></a> But was he before Him?<a name=325:9></a> Samuel had already been out of accord in mourning for Saul, and now he is out of accord in thinking that Eliab was the anointed one.<a name=325:10></a> So the most spiritual of us may be mistaken.<a name=325:11></a> Which shows the necessity of being with God; we must not be out of accord with the mind of God.<a name=325:12></a> And that enters into church administration as to persons we receive or refuse, whether the reception or refusal be according to God.<a name=325:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the sons of Jesse passed before Samuel, and God said, 'Do not look at the outward appearance'.<a name=325:14></a> Think of God having to adjust that great servant in his old age.<a name=325:15></a> We need adjustment all the time; God looks at the heart.<a name=325:16></a> He says, 'He is not the anointed one; you are making a mistake'.<a name=325:17></a> And Samuel is corrected; it is beautiful to see the old brother corrected.<a name=325:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next comes before him: the Lord has not chosen him, and so the seven pass before him, and none of them are chosen.<a name=325:19></a> Samuel would think, 'Have I come to Bethlehem for nothing?<a name=325:20></a>' He says to Jesse, "Are these all the young men?<a name=325:21></a>" And Jesse answered, "There is yet the youngest remaining".<a name=325:22></a> David is Christ in type.<a name=325:23></a> Samuel has learned his

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So David comes in, a young shepherd, just looking after the sheep, and Jehovah says, "Arise, anoint him; for this is he".<a name=326:3></a> Do you ever see that in a meeting?<a name=326:4></a> God is delighted with the movements of that young man; he is a type of Christ, and God is pleased with him.<a name=326:5></a> The Spirit of God depicts the young man: "ruddy, and besides of a lovely countenance and beautiful appearance".<a name=326:6></a> And Samuel anoints him then.<a name=326:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I am speaking of David in the school of God.<a name=326:8></a> God was pleased with him and gave him His Spirit, anointed him.<a name=326:9></a> The Spirit came upon him then.<a name=326:10></a> But now we come to a point when God is displeased with the same person.<a name=326:11></a> It is a very solemn thing.<a name=326:12></a> At one time I am sensible of being pleasing to God and another time I am sensible of being displeasing; that God is displeased with me, and I cannot leave it at that.<a name=326:13></a> If you go into the world, the displeasure of God goes with you and follows you.<a name=326:14></a> He does not like your ways and He will make you feel it.<a name=326:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The thing that David did displeased the Lord, we are told here.<a name=326:16></a> It was so manifestly wrong that even Joab questioned what David did, yet that dear man of God, David, did it.<a name=326:17></a> The most spiritual are capable of displeasing God; but He will not let us off, He loves us too well.<a name=326:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		David had a man through whom God could speak to him.<a name=326:19></a> Some of us close the door so that God cannot speak to us; we shut the door fast in His face.<a name=326:20></a> But David had a seer; Gad is called his seer.<a name=326:21></a> At this time he is a prophet of God, but I believe that in a person like David, however far away he might get from God, there is something through which God can address him.<a name=326:22></a> He had a seer: He had a man there in Gad, who is called David's seer.<a name=326:23></a> Why should he be

	<div class="paragraph">
		Every one who is going on with God has a seer.<a name=327:3></a> There is that element through which God can address him.<a name=327:4></a> So God takes up this element, Gad, and sends him to David, saying, "I offer thee three things; choose one of them .<a name=327:5></a>.<a name=327:6></a>.<a name=327:7></a> .<a name=327:8></a> Choose thee, either three years of famine, or three months to be destroyed before thine adversaries .<a name=327:9></a>.<a name=327:10></a>.<a name=327:11></a> or three days the sword of Jehovah and the pestilence in the land".<a name=327:12></a> David had had to do with famine before, he had had three years of it, so he knew well what that meant.<a name=327:13></a>

		There is no famine today, there is abundance of food and everything that man needs.<a name=327:14></a> God is good to men; He is doing His part.<a name=327:15></a> Whatever it is that men need, it is in abundance.<a name=327:16></a> Some of the food is two or three years old: God has provided that.<a name=327:17></a> So we do not rightly call the present stress a famine in the ordinary sense of the word.<a name=327:18></a> It is maladministration on the part of men.<a name=327:19></a> The bounty of God is not available because of maladministration.<a name=327:20></a> But that is by the way.<a name=327:21></a> David knew what three years of famine meant; we get that in <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#21">2 Samuel  21</a>.<a name=327:22></a> So David is told to choose.<a name=327:23></a> How beautiful that God put it into David's hands to decide.<a name=327:24></a> What a God we have!<a name=327:25></a> 'What will you choose?<a name=327:26></a> It is imperative; there must be the discipline because you are in my school, and I love you too well to let you off.<a name=327:27></a> You must go through it.<a name=327:28></a> Then I will show how you have gained enormously from it'.<a name=327:29></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=368:1></a> This verse 19 gives us the only names of the divine Persons in which they are seen as relative to One Another.<a name=368:2></a> The names that we have throughout the Scriptures seem to be names expressly in relation to creation, so that the baptismal formula, having in view that we should believe, implies that believers are introduced into the light of God as the Trinity under names in which the Persons are in relation to Each Other, and, as in these relations to One Another, they are in relation to men or nations or the whole realm of creation.<a name=368:3></a> That is, the one God as the Trinity is conveyed under names of graded relationship.<a name=368:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=368:15></a> Yes, and, of course, in the light of other scriptures we know it is.<a name=368:16></a> From the actual original meaning of the word we cannot assume it was a name that the divine Persons would employ in relation to One Another in absoluteness, meaning 'wind' or 'breath'.<a name=368:17></a> We cannot speak of the three divine Persons in absoluteness regarding one as the Spirit and the Others as something else, because "God is a Spirit".<a name=368:18></a> So that what is behind it is now understood.<a name=368:19></a> It is evidently a name taken in relation to creation involving power in action and yet perhaps unseen.<a name=368:20></a> The first mention of the Spirit is that He was hovering over the face of the waters, as if the suggestion is of divine feeling and sympathy, God in nearness to the need.<a name=368:21></a> As indeed in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#6">Genesis  6</a>the Spirit is referred to as striving with men, a very lowly attitude to take with men away from God; He is seen striving with them.<a name=368:22></a>

		FEATURES OF THE TESTIMONY IN THE LIGHT OF THE TRANSLATION OF THE ASSEMBLY

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=392:1></a> I have before me the present movements of the Lord by the Spirit in the light of translation to heaven.<a name=392:2></a> The idea of the assembly's translation, as in accord with the Lord's ascension, has been current for a long time amongst the people of God; the Lord would bring it before us and keep us moving in that light, going over the ground of the testimony in its different features.<a name=392:3></a> As we take up any one of the features we always find something fresh.<a name=392:4></a> The ground that may have been covered before will always yield something fresh if covered again in the Lord's company.<a name=392:5></a> We have in this book (chapter 1: 2) the significant fact that one man falls irretrievably.<a name=392:6></a> "Ahaziah fell down"; there is no recovery for him, and another ascends, as it says, "When Jehovah would take up Elijah into the heavens by a whirlwind", chapter 2: 1.<a name=392:7></a> These are two most significant facts in this book -- the irretrievable ruin of one man by his fall, and the elevation of another by the power of God into heaven.<a name=392:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		N.K.<a name=392:9></a>M.<a name=392:10></a> It looks as though the feelings of God entered into the taking up of Elijah; it says, "Jehovah would take up Elijah".<a name=392:11></a> Is that significant?<a name=392:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=392:13></a> Yes; it was a note of determination or decision on the part of God.<a name=392:14></a> It had long been in mind, there is no variation in the mind of God, He would do it.<a name=392:15></a> What He has indicated as regards His people will come about.<a name=392:16></a> The time of our transference to heaven is drawing near, and this passage would indicate that there is to be no relinquishment of energy but rather an increase of energy in going over and covering the ground of the testimony.<a name=392:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=393:4></a> I think Elijah's translation is more figurative of the Lord's ascension.<a name=393:5></a> Elijah is a public man, answering to the Lord's own testimony, and what is in keeping with it; but Enoch is a disciplined man as his name signifies.<a name=393:6></a> It would denote the kind of man he was, and what befits us now, to be in obscurity.<a name=393:7></a> He walked with God after his son was born, and this is a very important matter for us today, because at the end of the dispensation the family side, the household side, is accentuated.<a name=393:8></a> It behoves parents to walk with God in view of the conditions in the world, so that we should not leave our children behind.<a name=393:9></a> It would appear that Methuselah did not come into the deluge, although he died almost the day before, showing there must have been an answer to Enoch's faith in walking with God after his son was born.<a name=393:10></a> The children of the saints seem to have been specially in the mind of God in recent times.<a name=393:11></a> The enemy would seek to rob God of victory in the households, but God will not allow it; as Moses said in Egypt, "We will go with our young and with our old", and then "our cattle also must go with us; there shall not a hoof be left behind".<a name=393:12></a> I believe Enoch's translation enters into that side.<a name=393:13></a> He has the testimony <i>before</i> his translation that he pleased God personally.<a name=393:14></a> There is nothing about his public testimony, although it must have been there; he pleased God and he walked with God.<a name=393:15></a> But Elijah is a great public man; he stands for that side.<a name=393:16></a> God gives us no account as to where he got his training; he just appears abruptly and the power is there at once.<a name=393:17></a> He stands out as a great public man for God, and now God would take him up.<a name=393:18></a> What do you say to that?<a name=393:19></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=396:5></a> The first thing to notice is the movement from Gilgal, that is the starting point.<a name=396:6></a> Gilgal has a great place in the history of the testimony from Joshua's time; it was where the twelve stones taken up out of the bed of the river Jordan were set up; and it was where the reproach of Egypt was rolled away in connection with circumcision the second time.<a name=396:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Gilgal is the place which denotes self-judgment by the Spirit, as it says, "the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of the Christ", <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:11">Colossians  2:11</a>.<a name=396:8></a> It is one of the features of spiritual geography, corresponding somewhat with <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#19">Luke  19</a>and the corresponding scriptures in the other gospels where the ass is tied.<a name=396:9></a> It illustrates the idea of spiritual geography.<a name=396:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		If I am not living in that I shall be living in the ordinary environment as regards either myself or my children, and in view of what we have been saying as to the households, this geography should be known; we ought to be conversant with it.<a name=396:11></a> If we are not in this, we shall live in the ordinary environment of the world, and be governed by the features that govern the ordinary course of this world.<a name=396:12></a> It may not be in a bad sense, but if, for instance, I have the university, the social, or the business circle prominently in my mind, it will give character to the household, and the children will not be held in the right relation but in relation to the world.<a name=396:13></a> But if the household is held on the principle of faith, this kind of geography is in mind always, and the children will be brought up in that environment.<a name=396:14></a> However little it may enter into them, they will not forget it in after years; it is bound to come back to them.<a name=396:15></a> Gilgal evidently is the starting point: "the circumcision of the Christ", the cutting off of the flesh, the denial of the flesh.<a name=396:16></a>

		My subject, as you will doubtless have divined, is 'measure', and I hope in the Lord that it may be used for the profit of all.<a name=411:1></a> In <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#10:13">2 Corinthians  10:13</a> we have the expression, "the God of measure".<a name=411:2></a> God is said to be the God of things as well as the God of persons -- the God of glory, for instance; but here He is said to be the God of measure, and that by one who is said earlier to be "a wise architect".<a name=411:3></a> The idea of the architect brings us back to the creation; for "wisdom" is so regarded in <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#9:1">Proverbs  9:1</a>.<a name=411:4></a> The "nursling" of <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#8:30">Proverbs  8:30</a> possibly alludes to architectural skill.<a name=411:5></a> Architecture requires measure.<a name=411:6></a> It certainly was employed by God in the creation when the foundations of the earth were laid.<a name=411:7></a> The great scheme of the creation was in His mind requiring most accurate measures and weights, so that there should be proportion and balance in this wonderful universe in which we are.<a name=411:8></a> Now these first three scriptures would show our true balance.<a name=411:9></a> They are significant in the sense that the idea is applied to the great moral system that God is constructing.<a name=411:10></a> All is on the principle of measure; and this should enter into the calculations and exercises of every christian, for he is designed to fill a place in the scheme, a measured place which cannot be filled by any other.<a name=411:11></a> Every stone in Solomon's structure was prepared before it was brought, so every believer is fitted for his place in the great divine structure; hence the importance of each taking account of this matter of measure.<a name=411:12></a>

		dispensation.<a name=412:1></a> Moses is said to be a ministering servant, and as such he was faithful in all God's house.<a name=412:2></a> That faithfulness included the principle of measurement.<a name=412:3></a> On the mount with God he was occupied with divinely-given measures, which he faithfully carried out.<a name=412:4></a> And so the apostle Paul is occupied with measures as the wise architect.<a name=412:5></a> In laying the foundation he had in mind the whole structure, and hence the need of measure, which is so prominent a thought in this scripture from his pen.<a name=412:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, the first thought, as you will observe in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12">Romans  12</a>, has relation to the individual believer in the initial stages of his history or place in the assembly.<a name=412:7></a> Romans hardly deals with the assembly, although the epistle has it in view.<a name=412:8></a> As one reads Romans, believing from the heart the form of teaching, one instinctively looks for the assembly; one would be at a loss without it.<a name=412:9></a> The apostle assumes its existence.<a name=412:10></a> Apart from the existence of the assembly the whole tenor of the epistle would be amiss and lost, but the assembly is in view, and as the believer progresses in it, he looks for the assembly.<a name=412:11></a> He is ready for it!<a name=412:12></a> And further, if anybody is a christian and not in the apprehension of the assembly or his place in it, these words are for you.<a name=412:13></a> You are not intended to be an isolated unit; you are intended to fit into your place in the assembly.<a name=412:14></a> So the apostle, having this in view, says, "For I say, through the grace which has been given to me, to every one that is among you".<a name=412:15></a> He is writing to the company of christians in the city of Rome, and he is contemplating them from the mutual side.<a name=412:16></a> The word 'mutual' is simple, it is much used, and is a very fitting word at this juncture of the epistle.<a name=412:17></a> So to <i>every one among you</i> refers to every saint in Rome in mutual relations.<a name=412:18></a>

		Well, I pass on to the fourth scripture.<a name=417:11></a> I want to dwell on the power to measure <i>discriminately</i>.<a name=417:12></a> Discrimination is a great matter amongst us.<a name=417:13></a> It is worked out in the types in connection with feeding and the kinds of food we are to eat; that contemplates discrimination.<a name=417:14></a> It runs right through Scripture the exercise of our senses as in Hebrews "to discern" or to discriminate "between good and evil".<a name=417:15></a> Now this is a matter which is very practical and in which I desire to appeal to every one of us as to whether we are discriminating in our measurements of public religious organisations.<a name=417:16></a> Each one has to decide and challenge himself as to where he is ecclesiastically.<a name=417:17></a>

		I am not using the word as in the ordinary current use, but in the sense of the church, the assembly, as taken from the original word.<a name=418:1></a> Each of us is to determine before the Lord as to where he is ecclesiastically; that is, where he is in regard of the assembly, where he is in regard of Christ as Lord in this present corrupt Christianity in which we find ourselves publicly.<a name=418:2></a> For we cannot leave Christendom, except to apostatise!<a name=418:3></a> It is a great house, and every Christian is called upon to discriminate as to this great house.<a name=418:4></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>the Lord speaks of manifesting Himself to the person who keeps His word -- "He that has my commandments and keeps them .<a name=418:5></a>.<a name=418:6></a>.<a name=418:7></a>".<a name=418:8></a> One says, "Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself to us and not to the world?<a name=418:9></a>" and the Lord answers, "If any one love me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our abode with him", <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:21">John  14:21</a> - 23.<a name=418:10></a> I apprehend that that means that the Lord comes to one where one is ecclesiastically; for the keeping of the commandment of Christ has separated him from the public corrupt body.<a name=418:11></a> "Let every one who names the name of the Lord withdraw from iniquity".<a name=418:12></a> The words kept bring me into the tabernacle condition, that is the condition in which God may dwell.<a name=418:13></a> How great is that thought!<a name=418:14></a> And yet what He may be to one person!<a name=418:15></a> -- it is to a person who by the keeping of the words of Christ is in tabernacle condition; he is in the structure; he has come to apprehend the structure, the dwelling place of God, what is suitable for the Father and the Son.<a name=418:16></a> How great that is!<a name=418:17></a> -- "We will come to him and make our abode with him".<a name=418:18></a>

		These scriptures illustrate the place the Lord Jesus has in the house of God, summed up in the expression in Hebrews which speaks of Him as "a great priest over the house of God".<a name=421:1></a> I wish to dwell on these passages with that in view, so that we, as the Lord may help us, may be encouraged to draw near to God.<a name=421:2></a> God is in heaven, we are told, and we upon earth, but that is not because He wishes to put a distance between Him and us; He has found a means of drawing near to us, and correspondingly of our drawing near to Him.<a name=421:3></a> As we see in Jacob, in connection with whom the house of God is introduced, there is in the ladder the divine suggestion of communication.<a name=421:4></a> The idea of a ladder between heaven and earth would be ridiculous in the eyes of the mere astronomer, but it is perfectly intelligible to faith.<a name=421:5></a> Faith understands where the astronomer cannot understand.<a name=421:6></a> So God would indicate to us that He wishes us near to Him, not simply as having been brought near from His own side, but that we should draw near from our side, and should think it worth while to do so.<a name=421:7></a> He says, "I have borne you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself", but then in the presence of that He inaugurates a system in mount Zion in relation to which His people were to draw near from their side, and to draw near not empty, but full, for "none shall appear before me empty", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#34:20">Exodus  34:20</a>.<a name=421:8></a>

		Now having made these remarks, before dwelling on the passage in Hebrews, I would seek to indicate from the Old Testament scriptures read, how this principle of one being set over the house began early.<a name=421:9></a> Although the house of God was not formally introduced

		in relation to Abraham, the household of faith was seen in him and in his house; and before we can understand the house of God we must understand the household of faith.<a name=422:1></a> These types are intended to help believers from their spiritual infancy to their manhood; the types are very largely for young believers; and though they may seem difficult, as soon as we recognise the Spirit, and read, considering what is said, the Lord gives us understanding and the types become wonderful to us.<a name=422:2></a> The things of God that seem distant otherwise, are brought very near to the eye in detail, in the types, so that we peculiarly learn in part.<a name=422:3></a> Then we learn how to put the parts together, for that is one more feature of the types and of the initial history of the christian, to know how to put things together; so that the household of faith is wisely introduced in Scripture before the house of God.<a name=422:4></a> Indeed the "father of all them that believe" is introduced even earlier.<a name=422:5></a> The name Abram signifies 'High father', that is to say, the suggestion is that his family will be brought up on principles morally higher than the principles of this world; and then he is called Abraham, the 'Father of a multitude', meaning that he is qualified to be that, in that he bears the character of moral elevation.<a name=422:6></a> It is the epistle to the Romans which prepares the believer for the household of faith; it tells us that Abraham was the father of all believers.<a name=422:7></a> Now that is an initial thought, but an important one; for the christian that is believing in the Lord Jesus is brought into, and regarded by heaven as in, the household of faith; that is to say, we have people who look at things on that principle.<a name=422:8></a> The astronomers do not, nor do any scientific men, as such, look at things on that principle, whereas believers all do; beginning with the cross they look at it on that principle, and therefore they know more really than the scientific men, as seeing things from the divine standpoint.<a name=422:9></a>

		Now that ought to appeal to everyone, especially to the young, that you are brought into a family that is governed by the principle of faith; not merely for salvation, but faith in regard of everything; that we are in a dispensation of faith; that God is carrying on His affairs now on that principle, so that we have access into His secrets, whereas the cleverest men in this world are outside of them.<a name=423:1></a> I am not excluding the Spirit, so the Spirit comes in on that principle.<a name=423:2></a> The Spirit is given to those who have faith, so that we have the means, beloved, not indeed of searching the depth of the physical creation -- that is to pass away -- but "the depths of God", the depths of the Creator, which is a far greater thing!<a name=423:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the first point in regard of these scriptures is that in the household of faith there is an overseer.<a name=423:4></a> He is first alluded to, as you will recollect, by name"Eliezer of Damascus", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#15:2">Genesis  15:2</a>.<a name=423:5></a> Abram does not refer to it there to distinguish him, he is simply a 'son of his house', meaning that he was just a domestic, or a slave, you might say, and Abraham was distressed that such an one should be his heir.<a name=423:6></a> But in chapter 24 the viewpoint is different, and we have no name given.<a name=423:7></a> Although this ruler of Abraham's house was there when Hagar fled -- she had a place in the household of faith, but she fled from it -- the idea was there; but now it is Abraham's "servant, the eldest of his house, who ruled over all that he had".<a name=423:8></a> No name is given, because, although we know that he is over the house from the scriptures, the way of God is to bring us to things <i>before</i> we name them.<a name=423:9></a> We have the New Testament Scriptures now, in which things are named for us, and we may use these names in a very inexperienced way, even the natural mind can take them up; but in the school of God the principle is that I learn a thing and experience a thing, and then I name it.<a name=423:10></a> And so in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24">Genesis  24</a>, the point is to stress for the young believer that there is such a thing as this kind

	<div class="page-number">

	<div class="paragraph">
		of overseership in the household of faith, someone who rules over all that is there, over all that Abraham has as the 'high father' and the 'father of a multitude'.<a name=424:1></a> He is evidently not a very vigorous kind of person, he does not rule with severity, but the believer comes to discover in due course as he believes the testimony of the gospel, that in the household of faith latitude, and looseness in general, and independency of thought and action, are foreign to this new family into which he is brought.<a name=424:2></a> He begins to see that there is a gentle, but nevertheless definite, rule in it, and he begins to see that it is for his good.<a name=424:3></a> As a matter of fact, the service of the Ruler of this house is to discover in the believer what is pleasing to Christ; He is looking out for something that the Lord Jesus died for, and He is putting forth His rule in a gentle but yet definite way in regard of that.<a name=424:4></a> He is over all that Abraham has, so to speak, and is concerned about what is dear to Christ; that is His particular business in chapter 24, and He carries out His service admirably and most successfully.<a name=424:5></a> If we give Him place He will discover, and give us to understand, that there is something pleasing to Christ in us, and that is a great leverage in the soul when the thought comes into it that there is at least something that is pleasing to the Lord.<a name=424:6></a> So this Steward over Abraham's house undertakes His service with the greatest care; He thinks out the difficulties of the way, for He has to do with young believers among whom we all have our part.<a name=424:7></a> Who is it that has had to do with young believers who does not well know the difficulties of getting at what belongs to Christ in them, and at what Christ cherishes?<a name=424:8></a> Now that is the ministry of this steward of Abraham's house in chapter 24.<a name=424:9></a> You will observe that Abraham is very old here, whereas what was to be sought out was to be young.<a name=424:10></a> The steward is old, too, but he has got universal sway in the household of faith; the older the better as regards

		experience, and this steward knew exactly the difficulties he had to contend with in his mission; but he overcomes them, as we have seen, not in a harsh way, but in a careful, calculated way, and on the principle of dependence upon God.<a name=425:1></a> What a fine thing it is to come in contact with this experienced element in the house, marked by dependence on God, and yet persistently seeking out that which Christ cherishes!<a name=425:2></a> The Lord has bought the field, according to the parable, because of the treasure in it, and also because of the pearl.<a name=425:3></a> He has bought the field in relation to the treasure, and His eye scans it day and night, to discover the treasure, so that He can set it free of false associations and encumbrances.<a name=425:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that is the idea of overseership, of one being over the household of faith, in this type; so that the servant is not occupying us with himself, and his name is not given, the point being to carry out the wish of Abraham and to secure what Isaac needs, and in this service he succeeds.<a name=425:5></a> The object is young, as I said, a maiden, typical of the young believer, but viewed as setting forth in principle the assembly, as that which the Lord is seeking.<a name=425:6></a> So this element in the household of faith is active day and night, to secure what the heart of Christ is set upon in believers, in young believers particularly, and the type shows the end, so that we might be encouraged that the end will be reached; for he finds Rebecca.<a name=425:7></a> The story is well known to us, but it should be studied from the standpoint now presented as bearing on the young christian; so that he comes to see the wisdom of this old experienced servant, involving an example for him in dependence; he sees the wisdom of it in the way it has reached him, and in the way it has secured him for Christ, to have part in the assembly.<a name=425:8></a> What can be greater, beloved, than that we should have part in that upon which the Lord Jesus has set His heart, and that for which He gave Himself?<a name=425:9></a>

		That is the first feature, and one which will be intelligible to everyone, that the principle of rule, or overseership, or authority, is exercised in matured experience and consideration and thoughtfulness, so as to secure its object, and dispel for ever from the mind of the believer all thought of independency, for independency deprives me of my greatest advantages.<a name=426:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the next feature of this rule in one over the house, is seen in Joseph's house.<a name=426:2></a> It is a bit further on as to the place it has in the history of the believer, but is of equal importance with what I have just dwelt upon.<a name=426:3></a> It is a question of the same kind of rule in the house, but in relation to the securing of the brethren: the believer comes into the idea of being set with the brethren of Christ.<a name=426:4></a> We need this rule if we are to reach that end, as much as in the other case.<a name=426:5></a> So you find that as Benjamin goes down with the brethren and comes into the view of Joseph, we get the mention of this man, or overseer, of his house.<a name=426:6></a> The Scriptures are marvellously accurate, whether the Old or New Testament, and they bear on us, for every line of them is written for christians.<a name=426:7></a> God is working out such a wonderful scheme at the present time, and securing such a wonderful result, that all the Scriptures are brought to bear upon us.<a name=426:8></a> So when I get the thought of one over the household of faith as a steward, I next come into the thought of one over the household of Joseph.<a name=426:9></a> Joseph is more directly a type of Christ than Abraham was.<a name=426:10></a> Abraham is the great father but Joseph represents Christ as the One who has brethren, and who will not be satisfied until He has them all, for He needs them all.<a name=426:11></a> Every one of us is needed by the Lord to form His "brethren", He secures an exact number; there are to be many, but the number, we may be certain, is determined, and all are necessary.<a name=426:12></a> We see the principle in Jacob's family and it runs through.<a name=426:13></a> Joseph in his wisdom is set to have them all but to have them on his own

		terms.<a name=427:1></a> There are many who take up the appellation "brethren" with little idea of the moral import of the term.<a name=427:2></a> We know that the evangelists give us a fourfold view of the "brethren" -- I do not go into that now -- but the appellation implies moral characteristics, and family characteristics, and the Lord is bent on securing that everyone bears these characteristics; and for this the principles of a man over His house is necessary.<a name=427:3></a> Now you will understand I am not speaking of the stewards of Abraham, and Joseph, as mere persons, for I have intimated before, that it is not a question of persons, but of these elements being found among believers, and as found, they are helpful and essential to our coming into the thing in view.<a name=427:4></a> The verses I read in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#43">Genesis  43</a>will indicate to you how interesting a man this was; his name is not given any more than that of Abraham's steward in chapter 24; it is the element that is in view; he comes into view immediately Benjamin is in sight.<a name=427:5></a> Benjamin is like the overcomer, he is the brother who has not offended, the others had, but as soon as he comes into the view of Joseph, this man over his house is immediately mentioned, and he is under Joseph; his attitude is perfectly in keeping with the mind of Joseph, he knows exactly what is going on.<a name=427:6></a> Now if we are awake to this, beloved, it will have a very real effect upon us in producing a certain sure vigilance, without any assumption attaching to it, that knows what is transpiring to the end that Joseph's mind should be carried out.<a name=427:7></a> Now see how this servant agrees with the mind of Joseph.<a name=427:8></a> Joseph directs him to bring the men into his house; it is the house of a great personage -- the Son of God, in type, who would bring all of us into accord with Himself as His brethren.<a name=427:9></a> This element is subservient to His thought, it is current and active all the time, for I may add that whilst these things work out in one way or another in the Lord's people through the

		power of the Spirit, they could not be in the house without the presence of the Holy Spirit.<a name=428:1></a> And so Joseph directs this servant to bring the men into the house, and they are concerned about being brought into the house.<a name=428:2></a> The brethren begin to feel that after all he may be using the word 'brethren' to them, and they have not realised what it means; and there has been conduct, there has been state, wholly out of keeping with it, so we can well understand their perturbation as they come to the door of the house.<a name=428:3></a> What is outside is very different from what is inside, and so they reason with the man, as you will observe, at the door.<a name=428:4></a> It says in verse 19, "They came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the house, and said, O, sir, we came indeed down at the first to buy food; and it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight; and we have brought it again in our hand.<a name=428:5></a> And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food; we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.<a name=428:6></a> And he said, Peace be to you, fear not".<a name=428:7></a> Now, dear brethren, what is in the minds of these men at the door of Joseph's house, is money, they are thinking of money, they are thinking of the money they had, and how it was put into their sacks, and how they brought more money down; but a place in Joseph's house, a place among the brethren of Christ, is not on that principle at all.<a name=428:8></a> We have to understand the ground on which things are in the house.<a name=428:9></a> It is not on the principle of money; these men were full of the idea of money, the money they had, and the money they brought down in addition, but this steward of Joseph's house says to them, "Peace be unto you".<a name=428:10></a> He knew all about that.<a name=428:11></a> This refers to the secret workings of the Spirit of God on these principles of oversight and authority, and

		yet there is no pretension attaching to it, for the Spirit Himself is here in the most subservient way, in the subservience of love, to secure the divine end; He would banish from us for ever the thought of securing a place with money.<a name=429:1></a> As Peter says to Simon Magus in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#8">Acts  8</a>, "Thy money go with thee to destruction, .<a name=429:2></a>.<a name=429:3></a>.<a name=429:4></a> Thou halt neither part nor lot in this matter".<a name=429:5></a> I do not say that was so with these men, but they did not understand what Joseph understood.<a name=429:6></a> Christ is bent on securing your heart as one of the brethren, and this element of overseership is active all the time to secure it.<a name=429:7></a> If you will look back on your history, you will see how it has been working.<a name=429:8></a> He says, "Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money".<a name=429:9></a> Now this is a lesson I would commend to all: how beautifully consolingly this man, this ruler over Joseph's house, spoke to these men: without his name being mentioned, but at the same time giving them to know that he knew all about them; and he connects God with them, and with their father; how he dignifies them!<a name=429:10></a> Now that is what we find as we approach the door of Joseph's house.<a name=429:11></a> We need to understand that God is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and presently we shall know that He is our God, too, and our Father, and that we are the brethren of Christ.<a name=429:12></a>

		Well now, I proceed to show you how this principle of the Lord's place over the house of God is illustrated in Aaron.<a name=429:13></a> I cannot say very much about Aaron; much has been said, but he represents the full thought illustrated in these three types.<a name=429:14></a> "For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and at his mouth they seek the law", <a href="../bible/Malachi.htm#2:7">Malachi  2:7</a>.<a name=429:15></a> We have now come into Exodus, where things are to be regulated formally and divinely; that is to say, Exodus gathers up the instruction in Genesis, and fits us for the assembly in

		type, where we each have our place.<a name=430:1></a> Everything is according to measure, in Exodus, and as the pieces or parts of the tabernacle are set up, each part is functioning; that is to say, intelligence marks the believer in Exodus, and Aaron is representative of this intelligence, and what comes out of that is good speaking.<a name=430:2></a> He could speak well.<a name=430:3></a> The history of Exodus shows that Aaron had a way of speaking that attracted people, and turned them from the world; as the people were about to return to Egypt (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#16">Exodus  16</a>), yearning for the fleshpots, Aaron spoke to them, and such was the power of his voice and of his words, that they turned towards the wilderness when he spoke.<a name=430:4></a> Who but Christ, beloved, the Great Priest in heaven as set out in Hebrews, could so control by His words, the hearts of the saints, that they turn away from the world, and turn towards the wilderness?<a name=430:5></a> The whole epistle to the Hebrews is just a matter of the power of the Priest turning our hearts away from the world, towards the wilderness where the tabernacle is.<a name=430:6></a> It says, "We have such a one high priest .<a name=430:7></a>.<a name=430:8></a>.<a name=430:9></a> minister of the .<a name=430:10></a>.<a name=430:11></a>.<a name=430:12></a> true tabernacle, which the Lord has pitched, and not man" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#8:1">Hebrews  8:1</a>, 2); it is the greatness of the Priest, and we have Him!<a name=430:13></a> That is the idea presented in Aaron.<a name=430:14></a> The Lord says to Moses, "Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother?<a name=430:15></a> I know that he can speak well.<a name=430:16></a> And also behold, he goeth out to meet thee", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#4:14">Exodus  4:14</a>.<a name=430:17></a> Dear brethren, how touching that is as applying to the Lord!<a name=430:18></a> He is the One that goes out to meet the brethren; He takes a long journey to meet the brethren, and when He sees them He is glad in His heart.<a name=430:19></a> That is the idea, and so the service of Aaron throughout is to encourage the hearts of the saints.<a name=430:20></a> The end is seen in his rod -- Aaron's rod -- which should denote the authority I am speaking about; it is the rod with which Moses is to approach the rock in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#20">Numbers  20</a>, to bring forth the water.<a name=430:21></a> It is Christ

		Having said that about Aaron, there are a few remarks to be made on the passage in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10">Hebrews  10</a>, which I have already anticipated.<a name=431:7></a> You will observe that <i>He is</i> the Great Priest over the house of God; it is no longer a mere principle or element, but a Person, a known Person, set over the house of God.<a name=431:8></a> The first mention of it is in chapter 3 where He is said to be Son over it.<a name=431:9></a> Moses was a servant in the house, "a ministering servant", and faithful in it; Christ is Son over it.<a name=431:10></a> He is over it, as having built it; such is the greatness of the house as referring to what the Son has set up.<a name=431:11></a> What He has set up is for ever and He rules over it as Son; that gives it its dignity.<a name=431:12></a> He is "a merciful and faithful high priest", so that we may know that He has the fullest sympathy with us.<a name=431:13></a> Hebrews shows how He comes in on the side of the brethren, "Since therefore the children partake of blood and flesh, he also, in like manner, took part in the same, that through death he might annul him who has the might of death, that is, the devil; and might set free all those who through fear of death through the whole of their life were subject to bondage", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:14">Hebrews  2:14</a>, 15.<a name=431:14></a> So chapter 4 says that we have a "great high priest" not yet over the house, but we have Him, and in that understanding we draw near to the throne of grace.<a name=431:15></a> But the house is not mentioned till chapter 10, because God would bring us to the

		In looking to the Lord to help, dear brethren, I have in view lovers of God.<a name=452:1></a> These scriptures all treat of this great subject, which will, I am sure, appeal to us, all of us, as I assume, being lovers of God.<a name=452:2></a> There are, alas, many non-lovers of God, lovers of pleasure, lovers of their own selves, indeed, self-love marks the non-lovers of God.<a name=452:3></a> The Holy Spirit takes notice of this as a peculiar feature of the last days amongst those who profess to have believed the gospel, for God is effectually shut out through self-love and love of pleasure, pleasure being preferred to God.<a name=452:4></a> So it occurred to me that help would accrue from attention being called to these passages.<a name=452:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first appears in the well-known gospel epistle of Paul, an epistle indeed, in which we might expect to find an allusion to the lovers of God; for God had lovers of Himself in mind in sending His Son as the epistle sets forth: "The gospel of God .<a name=452:6></a>.<a name=452:7></a>.<a name=452:8></a> concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#1:1">Romans  1:1</a>, 3.<a name=452:9></a> The opening verses help us to grasp the idea of God; it has to be grasped in the mind, as it is said, "No one has seen God at any time" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:18">John  1:18</a>), a statement that has to be constantly in view.<a name=452:10></a> We are indeed reminded of the infinitude of God.<a name=452:11></a> The Lord Jesus tells us also that "God is a spirit"; and we are told that He dwells "in unapproachable light; whom no man has seen, nor is able to see" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#6:16">1 Timothy  6:16</a>), and yet He is to be loved!<a name=452:12></a> How such a Being, how the great Being whom we reverently address as God, should become known in our tiny hearts and loved by them, is indeed a matter of supreme interest, and it should be enquired into.<a name=452:13></a> How God should come into one's

		heart and mind, so as to be revered and loved, is indeed a matter to arrest the attention of everyone.<a name=453:1></a> The enquiry of every heart should be as to whether the matter has been faced, or whether we have just accepted the formula of Scripture without enquiring into its magnitude and bearing, its possibility, how it is so.<a name=453:2></a> Surely it is important, dear brethren, to look in, as it were, and make an examination of oneself as to the application; to see <i>whether</i> there is really an application of this great fact to one, that he loves God.<a name=453:3></a> If one does, the legitimate enquiry is, What is it, Who is it that one loves?<a name=453:4></a> For we are not to be content with mere words, the sense of them is to be in our souls.<a name=453:5></a> So that if one is to pursue such an enquiry to its end, he has to revert to his conversion.<a name=453:6></a> It is always wholesome to take a retrospective view of one's history, looking back upon it to the beginning of it and to determine with intelligence and feeling and affection what one's relations with God really are, and how God came into the mind.<a name=453:7></a> Now the epistle to the Romans is intended to aid this very enquiry; it is the presentation to our hearts of God; not in the creation, <i>although</i> it tells us that He is known in the creation, that "the invisible things of him are perceived, being apprehended by the mind through the things that are made, both his eternal power and divinity", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#1:20">Romans  1:20</a>.<a name=453:8></a> But then, those invisible things of Him, and His eternal power and divinity are not exactly Himself; yet there is the great thought of a Creator present in the creation, according to Romans.<a name=453:9></a> But the epistle is intended to convey to us, not simply that that is mentioned incidentally, but to convey to us God, in His Son, but yet God, and still retaining His place of infinitude as beyond our comprehension.<a name=453:10></a> But He comes in in His Son: "The gospel of God .<a name=453:11></a>.<a name=453:12></a>.<a name=453:13></a> concerning his Son", the Spirit interjecting parenthetically that He was David's seed after the flesh.<a name=453:14></a> He was a real Man,

		but declared, or marked out "Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of the dead".<a name=454:1></a> A Person thus knowable in human condition meets us, dear brethren, at the outset and is kept before us throughout.<a name=454:2></a> But God is nevertheless there; never ceasing to be what He is, never ceasing to be invisible, so that we can see how the knowledge of God coming into the soul of the believer, of man, ennobles him, enlarges him, lifts him out of the mere carnal reckonings that are natural to him into the realm of God; God remains God, and the believer remains man, but yet God is known, and known so as to be loved.<a name=454:3></a> To my mind this is a wonderful proposal!<a name=454:4></a> A wonderful proposition, that should command the close attention of every believer, for we are very prone, dear brethren, to live in terms handed down to us or found in Scripture, without investigating the application to ourselves of the verity of them.<a name=454:5></a> So that we are in the realm of God as knowing Him and loving Him.<a name=454:6></a> But then the epistle presents Him in a Man, so as to affect the conscience of man, so as to affect his mind, so as to arrest his mind; for the epistle is to be read in that way as something marvellous, something to arrest the mind of man; and thus gradually he is let into the realm of the knowledge of God, and elevated morally, taken out of the order of things in which he lived naturally.<a name=454:7></a> First we have the "righteousness of God", that there is such a thing as that, not simply righteousness, but righteousness of God; that is, the idea of God is kept steadily before the mind; and then the power of God, not simply in creation, great as that is, but in raising Christ, and then the love of God.<a name=454:8></a> When we come to chapter 5, the love side, the Spirit seems to be more active and pungent in His remarks, saying that "the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which has been given to us".<a name=454:9></a> It is the love of God, not now the righteousness, or the power, these

		are attributes to be apprehended, but the love is more than an attribute of God, it is an attribute of God, but it is His nature -- if I may use that word -- which is only rightly used of God as that into which we come, in which we have part; the word is not otherwise used of God.<a name=455:1></a> The "divine nature" is that in which we have part, it is not a question of essential being or substance or form, but of what is made known in Christ, what is humanly expressed, so that we have part in it (see <a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#1:4">2 Peter  1:4</a>).<a name=455:2></a> Love is what God is, but what God is as humanly expressed, expressed in Christ as the Son, the love of God is actually "shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which has been given to us".<a name=455:3></a> Without any explanation as to how the Holy Spirit came into such a position as to do this, the great fact is mentioned that the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which has been given to us.<a name=455:4></a> And then the Spirit goes on to say that, "God commends his love", not His righteousness or His power, but His love, as if that is the point before Him, that His love should be known; commended to us, not only shed abroad in our hearts but commended to us, so that we might have an intelligent grasp of it, of what the love of God is.<a name=455:5></a> So that we are told elsewhere, "Hereby we have known love" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:16">1 John  3:16</a>); it is a thing to be known, to be realised, of course, by the Spirit shedding it abroad in our hearts, but it is to be known; and in truth the great feature in our knowledge of God and our loving God, is that His love is known.<a name=455:6></a> He commends it to us so that it might be known; He is concerned that it might be known; and as it is known, there is response, and that response is that we love God.<a name=455:7></a> An immense result, dear brethren, for God, that there are at least some lovers of God, as the apostle says, "those that love God".<a name=455:8></a> Indeed in the Old Testament God had a large number of His lovers in view, "thousands of

		Well now, in Corinthians we have further advantages to lovers of God.<a name=457:4></a> The first is in chapter 2; it is a chapter which links on really with <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:28">Romans  8:28</a>, which gives us a look into the land; <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2">1 Corinthians  2</a>indicates to us what is there.<a name=457:5></a> In the wilderness, as you will recall, twelve spies were sent up into Canaan; they were to see what was in the land, for there is the gospel of place as well as the gospel of righteousness.<a name=457:6></a> The gospel of place is the tidings that the Holy Spirit brings to us of what is in the land, and, as opening up the subject of the Spirit in Corinthians, the apostle links on with the passage in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>, but touches on the things that are in the land.<a name=457:7></a> We are enjoined in Colossians to have our mind on the things above (chapter 3: 2) and we are told in Philippians to "judge of and approve the things that are more excellent" (chapter 1: 10).<a name=457:8></a> Now our passage in Corinthians lets us into what was before the world; the apostle says that he spoke wisdom among those that were perfect.<a name=457:9></a> Some of us today were speaking about classification, and it is a most important matter to be able to take account of the work of God in His people.<a name=457:10></a> There are some that are perfect; there are some that are only babes, according to this epistle.<a name=457:11></a> Those that are perfect are ready for things that belong to "that world and the resurrection", so that he says, "God's wisdom in a mystery, that hidden wisdom which God had predetermined before the ages for our glory".<a name=457:12></a> The passage reminds us, dear brethren, of our place,

		Well then, there is the final thought, dear brethren, and that is that those who love God are set over against the enemies of God.<a name=462:12></a> In <a href="../bible/Judges.htm#5">Judges  5</a>we have the song of Deborah and Barak.<a name=462:13></a> They are joint warriors fighting against the heads of the nations, and they overcame, so that they can speak about the enemies of God.<a name=462:14></a> Terrible thought that there are enemies of God!<a name=462:15></a> It is well that we should awake to the fact that there are enemies of God, they are increasing rapidly, apostasy is spreading rapidly, it involves increase in the enemies of God.<a name=462:16></a> But then, over against the enemies of God, there are the lovers of God.<a name=462:17></a> Let us stand up manfully to this; lovers of God as over against the enemies of God.<a name=462:18></a> What marks the enemies of God is darkness.<a name=462:19></a> Judas went out, he was an enemy of God, and it was night (<a href="../bible/John.htm#13:30">John  13:30</a>); he added to the darkness that was outside.<a name=462:20></a> And so it is, there are those who have gone out from us, as John says, "According as ye have heard that antichrist comes, even now there have come many antichrists, whence we know that it is the last hour", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:18">1 John  2:18</a>.<a name=462:21></a> It is the hour when the lines are sharply drawn between the enemies of God and those that love God.<a name=462:22></a> The advantage here is that they shine "as the rising of the sun in its might".<a name=462:23></a>

		Well these, dear brethren, are the benefits, among others, accruing to love for God.<a name=463:8></a> There is a challenge and an appeal to us, as to whether we are lovers of self or lovers of pleasure instead of being lovers of God.<a name=463:9></a> God is looking for our hearts, He is looking for them entirely, saying, "My son, give me thine heart" (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#23:26">Proverbs  23:26</a>), and He clothes His lovers with these wonderful advantages as an appeal that we might rally to His standard, as the lines are so sharply drawn now between His enemies and those who love Him.<a name=463:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These scriptures treat of the remnant, concerning which I hope to speak; a subject familiar to us and which has often been spoken of in ministry, but the importance of which stands out specially now, in view of the end so that the quality of it may improve, for the principle is that what there may be of God is to increase more and more, so that as the scripture says, we may judge of and approve the things that are more excellent.<a name=464:1></a> As we do, they will give character to us, for what the heart and mind are engaged with gives colour and character to us.<a name=464:2></a> Hence we are enjoined; "have your mind on the things that are above", <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3:2">Colossians  3:2</a>.<a name=464:3></a> Things above are excellent in quality; they are where Christ sits, at the right hand of God.<a name=464:4></a> What a suggestion for us, dear brethren, to be engaged with the things above -- things "where the Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God"!<a name=464:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the leading or initial thought of the remnant is that it is God's own reservation on the ground of moral worth; it is something that He reserves sovereignly for Himself; and as applying to the saints now, it enters into the greatest thoughts of the assembly, thoughts that are included in the first prayer of the apostle Paul in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>; thoughts which referring to the Ephesian Christians then, apply equally to ourselves now: "so that ye should know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints".<a name=464:6></a> For "Jehovah's portion is his people; Jacob the lot of his inheritance" -- as the Old Testament tells us (<a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#32:9">Deuteronomy  32:9</a>), and these great pristine thoughts apply to the assembly as well as to the remnant.<a name=464:7></a> It is God's reservation for Himself.<a name=464:8></a>

		I refer to the passage in <a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#19">1 Kings  19</a>, known to us and cited by the apostle Paul in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11">Romans  11</a>.<a name=465:1></a> Elijah's life was threatened by Jezebel, and this has a present application, for her threats have always been present in the church period since she acquired the ascendancy, since she was suffered to teach: as the Lord says to the church at Thyatira, "thou permittest the woman Jezebel, she who calls herself prophetess, and she teaches".<a name=465:2></a> She has been given space to repent, but she will not do so, but will persecute the saints and servants of the Lord as she has opportunity, and as she has often done in the history of the church.<a name=465:3></a> Her opportunities are greatly curbed; her power is broken, but nevertheless the opposition to, and hatred of, the saints of God and His servants, is there -- a very solemn fact.<a name=465:4></a> Time was when I could not have spoken thus without being arrested, but thank God, she is curbed, her power is broken, but the venom is there and ready to show itself at every opportunity.<a name=465:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Jezebel sends word to Elijah that his life should be like one of the prophets of Baal whom he had slain, and he fled.<a name=465:6></a> Then he tells the Lord later that Israel had killed the prophets, digged down the altars, and that he was left alone and they sought his life to destroy it.<a name=465:7></a> His speech at Horeb seemed clear and decisive, but it was wanting.<a name=465:8></a> He was not in the position to which his commission referred, for it did not relate to Horeb, nor to the wilderness, but to the inhabited land of Canaan, whence he had fled.<a name=465:9></a> But the Lord has an answer for him.<a name=465:10></a> He pleaded with God against Israel, which is a sorrowful feature in such a great servant, but is a reminder to us that we should be on our guard in ministering to the people of God, for even with servants like Elijah and Moses, the one pleads against the people and the other calls them rebels -- and the Lord is not pleased with that.<a name=465:11></a> So the word is in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11">Romans  11</a>, "What says

		Now to prevent all this danger, we have specific instructions which always attach to the priesthood I refer to <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#10">Leviticus  10</a>.<a name=468:3></a> The chapter commences "And the sons of Aaron" -- not first stating their names, "Nadab and Abihu", but emphasising that it was such people, the sons of Aaron, the priests of God, who presented the strange fire.<a name=468:4></a> How solemn a thing it is!<a name=468:5></a> So what follows in the chapter is the injunction that no wine or strong drink was to be used by the priests when they entered the sanctuary.<a name=468:6></a> Elsewhere we find that no woollen garments were to be worn, meaning that all natural excitement or stimulation is abhorrent in the sanctuary of God; that there should be sobriety and holy calculation in what we say or do; five words with the understanding, five words with the Spirit, knowing what we are saying.<a name=468:7></a> We would challenge ourselves lest we should offend against God and present strange fire before Him.<a name=468:8></a> Then again, no natural affection or natural consideration for relatives after the flesh was to be allowed; that also is abhorrent to the atmosphere of the sanctuary.<a name=468:9></a> Even death itself is not to call forth expressions of sorrow there, for the priests were not to uncover their heads, nor to rend their garments, even in such a calamity as had occurred here.<a name=468:10></a> The remnant that is left, those left of the priesthood, are comparatively few today, but still the injunctions remain, but then, all the holy privileges of the priesthood also remain to those who are left.<a name=468:11></a> All that they had at Pentecost is ours!<a name=468:12></a> All that they had at Ephesus and at Antioch!<a name=468:13></a> How great are these things!<a name=468:14></a> -- and in the sense of this it becomes incumbent

		I have in mind to seek to show how God intended to continue here what Christ was as Man before men, and in the midst of His own.<a name=519:1></a> He said when challenged as to Himself that He was altogether that which He said to them.<a name=519:2></a> "Altogether that which I also say to you", He says (<a href="../bible/John.htm#8:25">John  8:25</a>).<a name=519:3></a> That sets out the idea of the candlestick in the type; its own ornamental function is called attention to.<a name=519:4></a> That is what the light is accredited by, that through which it comes, otherwise it must remain light without a model, the thought being that the effect of the testimony is that it becomes like that through which it comes, that those who are affected by the truth become like the Person or persons through whom it comes; so that there is not only light but example, or model; so that the formation may be in keeping with it, and thus there is the great continuance of the divine thought, of the thought of God.<a name=519:5></a> And in this respect I may say, dear brethren, that all is on the principle of faith at the present time.<a name=519:6></a> Christianity has lapsed (and began to lapse almost as the apostles departed) into a sight system, a system that was comprehensible by the natural mind and was, in fact, the product of that mind.<a name=519:7></a> It took form among the Greeks and was adopted, and the truth of christianity incorporated with it was so mixed and adulterated and lowered to the level of the human mind, that it has become one of the sciences, that which is called theology; whereas the divine thought was something altogether outside the range of the natural mind, the natural man all the time being responsible, but the testimony was
