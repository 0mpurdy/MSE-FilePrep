		Dear Brethren, -- With mingled feelings of thankfulness and sorrow, we write you as to the result of the recent troubles through which this assembly has passed.<a name=3:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With the sense of the Lord's presence, support and comfort, we are still seeking to keep the unity of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:3">Ephesians  4:3</a>).<a name=3:3></a> We believe the Lord has permitted the sifting to take place that His assembly in this city might be a brighter witness to Himself than ever before, and whilst many with whom we long walked in happy fellowship, have been overthrown by the wile of the enemy, we are deeply thankful there yet remain two or three who can count on the Lord's presence in the midst according to His faithful word (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:20">Matthew  18:20</a>).<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This assembly had been troubled of late by certain brothers who from the first were favourable to the schismatic action of Messrs.<a name=3:5></a> Lowe and McCarthy which has brought such wide-spread dishonour upon the Lord's name and testimony.<a name=3:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Opportunity was given them on several occasions to substantiate the charges they had adopted against our brother, Mr.<a name=3:7></a> F.<a name=3:8></a> E.<a name=3:9></a> Raven, and the Greenwich assembly, but this they utterly failed to do.<a name=3:10></a> At the close of the last assembly meeting called for this purpose, a brother arose and stated (in substance) that, as the charges against our brother had not been proven, and as Bexhill had departed from the ground of gathering, this meeting would break bread as usual in fellowship with Greenwich, on the following Lord's day.<a name=3:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On the Lord's day morning, a number of these brothers came into the room where the assembly was gathered, and soon retired again for consultation.<a name=3:12></a> They re-entered the room and removed the bread which had been placed there by the brother who habitually supplied it.<a name=3:13></a> They then produced another loaf that they might break bread on <i>neutral ground</i>.<a name=3:14></a> This, however, they did not then do, but left the place after putting away the bread and cup to prevent the assembly breaking bread in their absence.<a name=3:15></a> On the following Lord's day the seceders were in possession of the room and made known their intention of breaking bread in fellowship with Bexhill.<a name=3:16></a> Some who were
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		present protested and left the room, and on the succeeding Lord's day the assembly met in another place to remember the Lord's death.<a name=4:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We desire to state briefly the grounds on which we reject the action of Bexhill.<a name=4:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When that meeting refused a letter of commendation from Greenwich, they gave as one reason for so doing that there was division amongst them.<a name=4:3></a> This was untrue, and besides was based upon the testimony of <i>one witness</i> who had left the meeting in a disorderly manner and was subsequently put away as a wicked person.<a name=4:4></a> There could not be a plainer violation of the word of God than this (see <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#13:1">2 Corinthians  13:1</a>) "In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established".<a name=4:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Their second reason was that the Greenwich assembly sheltered a teacher of evil doctrine.<a name=4:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When asked to furnish proof for this charge, they refused to give any particulars, as is proved by the following extract from a letter from Greenwich: 'We have to say that no charge against our brother, Mr.<a name=4:7></a> R.<a name=4:8></a> has been preferred before the assembly here by any person whatever within or without the meeting'.<a name=4:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If there were charges against Mr.<a name=4:10></a> Raven why were they not brought before the assembly whose responsibility it was to clear itself from evil if such existed, according to <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5:13">1 Corinthians  5:13</a> "Therefore put away from among <i>yourselves</i> that wicked person"?<a name=4:11></a> So far from any charge being preferred before the Greenwich assembly, its righteous demand for particulars was termed evasion, and then was consummated the ecclesiastical assumption of Bexhill by cutting off Greenwich Assembly and all in fellowship with it.<a name=4:12></a> We therefore reject the action of Bexhill which has placed them outside the ground of God's assembly, and we refuse to follow them there, as many of our beloved brethren have done, preferring to follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:22">2 Timothy  2:22</a>).<a name=4:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The seceders are not unanimous as to their reasons for going out from us -- some basing their action upon the Bexhill judgment, others upon what Mr.<a name=4:14></a> Raven teaches, and we desire to add a few words as to the latter.<a name=4:15></a> We have carefully examined the printed statements issued by Mr.<a name=4:16></a> Raven, and can discern nothing contrary to sound doctrine.<a name=4:17></a> We see that his accusers have themselves overstepped the bounds of Scripture in their

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		zeal to prove him a heretic and are bitterly opposing blessed truth of the last importance for the saints to hold fast.<a name=5:1></a> We enumerate a few of the errors into which they have fallen:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1st.<a name=5:2></a> Confounding Eternal Life with Deity.<a name=5:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2nd.<a name=5:4></a> Affirming that Eternal Life was manifested <i>to</i> the world.<a name=5:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3rd.<a name=5:6></a> Affirming that responsibility attaches to our position as in Christ before God.<a name=5:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the first error, <a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:20">1 John  5:20</a>, is explicit: "This is the true God, and eternal life".<a name=5:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the second, it is never said in Scripture that eternal life was manifested <i>to</i> the world; so that in maintaining this they go beyond the limits of revelation.<a name=5:9></a> We find in <a href="../bible/1John.htm#1:2">1 John  1:2</a>, a clear statement of the scope of its manifestation: "That eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto <i>us</i>".<a name=5:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The word of God abounds with precious distinctions between our path of pilgrimage on earth, and our being seated in heavenly places in Christ, but always connects the thought of responsibility with the path of pilgrimage and not with our position in the heavenly places (see <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#3:14">Hebrews  3:14</a>; <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#4:11">Hebrews  4:11</a>).<a name=5:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Strengthening our own judgment of Mr.<a name=5:12></a> Raven's writings, we have the united testimony of forty brothers from various parts who visited him with reference to the doctrines in question, and who state that he holds nothing contrary to the word of God.<a name=5:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have thus, dear brethren, stated briefly our judgment of the sorrowful action of our brethren who have gone into division so dishonouring to the Lord, and our earnest prayer to God is that many of them may be brought back again to the Lord's Table with a deeper sense than ever of His love and faithfulness.<a name=5:14></a>

		Dear Brother, -- Your letter of August 31st was duly received, and nothing but sheer want of time has prevented an earlier reply.<a name=6:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Being so far from Minneapolis and not knowing the brethren I am somewhat at a disadvantage in having to say to the difficulty amongst you.<a name=6:4></a> My belief is that when matters of <i>local</i> difficulty arise the wisest course is to confine them as much as possible.<a name=6:5></a> It is impossible for people at long distances, who are not acquainted with the people nor the conditions, to judge fairly in such matters.<a name=6:6></a> I believe those most locally connected are the most likely to have the Lord's mind; and it usually happens that there are those more or less qualified to judge righteous judgment.<a name=6:7></a> In this case it seems to me Chicago is the meeting best fitted, and the matter has really been <i>brought</i> to them.<a name=6:8></a> This is how I take it and I constantly look to the Lord that He may guide them to a just decision.<a name=6:9></a> The conduct of the brethren at Minneapolis (I refer to your own confession; although I do not think brethren regard what you admit as <i>all</i>) has brought them, so to say, to the bar: hence <i>they</i> are not the judges.<a name=6:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards the difficulty itself: where there has been a breakdown such as your letter indicates it is evident there must be a fresh start.<a name=6:11></a> I do not think there is such a thing as <i>collective</i> confession and restoration.<a name=6:12></a> Where there is departure I think the true way of recovery is for each individual to seek the Lord for himself (see <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#33:7">Exodus  33:7</a>).<a name=6:13></a> It is only under these conditions there can be a fresh start according to God.<a name=6:14></a> Of course I do not know why Johanson and Cowles refuse to meet you -- I should like very much to hear what they have to say.<a name=6:15></a> It is likely that their judgment is that you have not yet left the "camp".<a name=6:16></a> If this be so I am not at all surprised; for as far as I can see you have not <i>moved</i> at all.<a name=6:17></a> You have <i>said</i> a good deal, and have more or less complied with the expressed wishes of the brethren, but of what avail is this when there is no <i>moral</i> movement?<a name=6:18></a> Your point (and also that of the printed paper of the 3rd inst.<a name=6:19></a> just received) is that you have come up to the letter of the law -- what was required: 'We have done all we can;' but your brethren at Minneapolis may not be thinking of what you have done, but of what <i>you are;</i> and it may be on this account they hesitate to meet with you on 'common

		ground'.<a name=7:1></a> There is no common ground for the Christian except the ground of righteousness: and if this does not exist how can there be a meeting together?<a name=7:2></a> I am not saying it does not exist, but at the same time I am far from censuring those at Minneapolis, who may think it does not, for thinking so.<a name=7:3></a> Indeed, I may say, I think they have good reason for thinking it does not exist.<a name=7:4></a> Your own letter and the printed paper alluded to give no encouragement that it does.<a name=7:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Not knowing the brethren at Minneapolis I cannot say much as to <i>their</i> attitude towards the truth.<a name=7:6></a> I am only acquainted with yourself and Mr.<a name=7:7></a> Barnaby.<a name=7:8></a> From the first time I met you I felt you dissented from the truth, and I think you know I felt thus.<a name=7:9></a> I assure you your attitude has pained me much, and it has pained many others of your brethren as well.<a name=7:10></a> You challenge your brethren to prove from Scripture wherein you have opposed the truth.<a name=7:11></a> What I say to this is, that my difficulty would be to find wherein you have <i>not</i> opposed it.<a name=7:12></a> I have been at many meetings with you and I may say frankly that I do not remember that you were <i>ever</i> at one with your brethren, i.<a name=7:13></a>e.<a name=7:14></a> speaking in a general way.<a name=7:15></a> I could easily furnish details, but this is hardly necessary.<a name=7:16></a> I do not think you can candidly deny what I say.<a name=7:17></a> Of course you will understand I am not charging this on any other person in Minneapolis.<a name=7:18></a> I only speak from personal knowledge of yourself and I think there are hundreds of brethren in this country who would (if asked) substantiate what I have affirmed.<a name=7:19></a>

		My Dear Brother, -- As to Toronto: It is true that some meetings have taken sides with those whom Rochester refused.<a name=7:26></a> Some of them however had done this long before Rochester acted.<a name=7:27></a> Those who have done so since have acted, I think, largely on the strength of their knowledge that some brethren of weight take their view of the matter.<a name=7:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I must say I am somewhat discouraged to find that you are one of these.<a name=7:29></a> I hardly thought you would see any good in calling the Rochester action in question at this late date.<a name=7:30></a> As

	<div class="paragraph">
		far as I know the brethren on this side <i>generally</i> accept the Rochester decision; and of course views <i>now</i> expressed to the contrary can but increase the spirit of division and unrest.<a name=8:1></a> But it seems doubtful that you have the facts of the case before you; otherwise I cannot see how you can say you fancy you could break bread with either side.<a name=8:2></a> Certainly I could not.<a name=8:3></a> A thoroughly lawless spirit has characterised those meeting at Ossington Hall.<a name=8:4></a> They had been entreated by their brethren all over this country to cease breaking bread; Mr.<a name=8:5></a> Raven, even, and those who came over with him, joining in this.<a name=8:6></a> But they steadily refused and after some eight months issued a circular to the effect that they had decided to continue breaking bread as always, etc.<a name=8:7></a>, etc.<a name=8:8></a> The consciences of their brethren in other meetings were entirely disregarded: they were right: they were those gathered to the Lord's name in Toronto, and ought to be so recognised by all.<a name=8:9></a> This was the ground they took and one or two meetings nearby acknowledged them.<a name=8:10></a> Now whatever one might feel about the others there can be but one judgment about such a course as the above.<a name=8:11></a> They had put themselves out of court entirely.<a name=8:12></a> What was there to encourage further waiting on them?<a name=8:13></a> Instead of a tendency to brokenness and subjection they proved themselves unbroken and independent.<a name=8:14></a> For several of them I, personally, had the highest regard, such as Hearn and Brodie, but when I met them at Rochester last year I could see they were entirely under a party influence.<a name=8:15></a> I think Blakely and Minto are the strongest factors.<a name=8:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to Cleghorn and the others, of course, there is nothing very special about them.<a name=8:17></a> But it was simply a question as to whether they should be prevented from breaking bread indefinitely, seeing he and others had disqualified themselves for any further consideration.<a name=8:18></a> I do not see how fellowship could be rightly withheld.<a name=8:19></a> Hence when Rochester acted I was thankful, although I was not aware they were going to act.<a name=8:20></a> The matter was purely local and when a meeting like Rochester acted on that ground the simplest and wisest course for all was to accept it.<a name=8:21></a> I doubt whether any good could have accrued from leaving both parties alone indefinitely.<a name=8:22></a> The possible end would be that they would <i>agree to differ</i> and thus patch up an external reconciliation.<a name=8:23></a> I feel sure that the most potent elements in the Ossington Hall party are hostile to the truth, and have been for many years.<a name=8:24></a> And I think it cruel to pursue a
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=9>[Page 9]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		course which would tend to force those who wish to go on with the truth into a nominal fellowship with such people.<a name=9:1></a> I think it better by far to have a few in Toronto going on more or less happily than a larger company biting and devouring one another; as has been the case for many years, as everyone knows.<a name=9:2></a> If Hearn, Brodie and the others more or less commendable humble themselves and submit to the judgment of their brethren generally it is an easy matter for them to find a place with the few now recognised.<a name=9:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I thought it well to send you the circular sent out by those with Dr.<a name=9:4></a> Hearn, to which I have referred.<a name=9:5></a> I also enclose Dr.<a name=9:6></a> Hearn's letter embodying the views of those at Ossington Hall with reference to the Rochester decision.<a name=9:7></a> I think you should have the facts before you if you are to judge in the case.<a name=9:8></a> When there I think you told me you did not read any of the papers sent you.<a name=9:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Of course such brethren as yourself and Mr.<a name=9:10></a> J.<a name=9:11></a> S.<a name=9:12></a> Allen are, to a certain extent, qualified to judge of American matters, knowing the brethren so well.<a name=9:13></a> Still it is very awkward when your view of a local matter runs counter to that of the brethren here.<a name=9:14></a> This may not have occurred to you, but I think if you consider it you will not fail to see how trying it must be to those who have done the best they could believing they had His support to have adverse views coming from long distances.<a name=9:15></a> <i>Before</i> the action was taken counsel would have been opportune but now that action has been taken it is but crying over spilt milk (to use a homely phrase) to deplore it.<a name=9:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Some have it in their minds that the Rochester brethren should withdraw their decision.<a name=9:17></a> But this is out of the question.<a name=9:18></a> It would not only be making nothing of the Lord's guidance and support among those who seek to act for Him (and I think this very serious) but besides it would but add to the confusion.<a name=9:19></a> It is altogether unlikely that those now recognised in Toronto would accept the reversal, and it is also unlikely that those around Toronto who have happily received them would now abandon them.<a name=9:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are five or six meetings in Ontario, numbering probably forty brethren in all, who refuse the Rochester decision; and I have no doubt if most of these knew that they were not supported by more prominent brethren they would see their way to accept that decision.<a name=9:21></a> The only brother of any weight on this side that I know of, who rejects the Rochester decision,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		is Mr.<a name=10:1></a> Magowan, and he has been 2,500 miles away from the scene for ten months.<a name=10:2></a> I doubt whether he has followed the developments.<a name=10:3></a> If he has he certainly ignores them.<a name=10:4></a> It seems to me if there was confidence in the Lord <i>and the brethren</i> the matter would be treated <i>as local</i> and the decision of those most locally connected would be accepted.<a name=10:5></a> The brethren in Rochester could have no selfish motive in what they did, and there is no reason in the world why they should not have the Lord's mind -- if they sought it.<a name=10:6></a> I do not doubt they sought it.<a name=10:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am sure if you understood matters rightly you would seek to strengthen the hands of the brethren in Rochester and in that way you would strengthen things generally on this side But if brethren in England continue to advance opposite views in regard to Toronto and Minneapolis there is no telling how things may end.<a name=10:8></a> There can be but one result -- disintegration.<a name=10:9></a>

		Beloved Brother, -- I thank you for sending Mr.<a name=14:13></a> Boyd's criticism of my paper on Canaan.<a name=14:14></a> It is such as I might have looked for from <i>him;</i> at least in this sense, that if he undertook to say anything he would endeavour to support his remarks by Scripture, and not lean on the importance of his personal judgment, as was the case with Mr.<a name=14:15></a> Allen and Mr.<a name=14:16></a> Henderson.<a name=14:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mr.<a name=14:18></a> Boyd is, of course, better acquainted with the scripture than I, and can write at length on the subject of heaven; and there is much of interest, and with which I quite agree, in what he says.<a name=14:19></a> I have endeavoured in my own measure (although, I am very sorry to say, I have not much time for study) to seize the idea of heaven as presented in Scripture, and according to my understanding of it I recognise the importance of it, I think, as much as anyone.<a name=14:20></a> In all that I have said publicly in regard to it I have had in my mind God's purpose as seen in the epistle to the Ephesians; I have not been occupied with details.<a name=14:21></a> I do not, of course, despise these, but I have not felt it needful to go into them, nor had I the time.<a name=14:22></a> In Ephesians the church's place in the divine scheme is clearly set forth, and there it is taught that its place is in the heavenlies.<a name=14:23></a> This is, in brief, my belief on the subject, and I am certain that no one can make out from what I have said that I hold anything else.<a name=14:24></a> I simply follow scriptures and say that the assembly goes into heaven; but to come out.<a name=14:25></a> It <i>does</i> come out, and is seen eternally in connection with the earth (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21">Revelation  21</a>), and no number of pages on the heavens (their number, location, etc.<a name=14:26></a>) can set this aside.<a name=14:27></a>

		But although there is much in what Mr.<a name=14:28></a> Boyd says about heaven that I do not object to, yet there are some things which do not appear right to me.<a name=14:29></a> On page 2 he makes the paradise to which the thief went our distinctive place, and that had been there from the creation.<a name=14:30></a> That is, our place was <i>always</i> there hence the force of <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:2">John  14:2</a> "I go to prepare a place for you"

		Your comments on the 'Chicago Notes' [See Volume 1, New Series J.<a name=16:13></a>T.<a name=16:14></a> -- Editor] did not reach me through any one on this side: they were inserted in a letter from Mr.<a name=16:15></a> J.<a name=16:16></a> Henderson of Clapham.<a name=16:17></a> Mr.<a name=16:18></a> Henderson, however, did not say they were yours, and up until the time I replied to his letter I did not know whose they were.<a name=16:19></a> Subsequently I learned you had written them.<a name=16:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In saying two of your statements were untrue I did not, of course, mean to say you were untruthful; I was simply dealing with the statements.<a name=16:21></a> I felt the writer of the criticism had either read the Notes very cursorily, or else his memory had failed him.<a name=16:22></a> As to your letter just received: Although the expressions are strong, I cheerfully accept the <i>admonitory</i> element in it.<a name=16:23></a> I accept fully that you mean nothing but good, and I feel a warning of this kind has its own voice and cannot injure me; on the contrary, it can but be of help.<a name=16:24></a> But your letter is not only admonitory: it is also condemnatory.<a name=16:25></a> In the following statement you adjudge me as very decidedly reprehensible in regard of the truth: 'These Notes indicate .<a name=16:26></a>.<a name=16:27></a>.<a name=16:28></a> a systematised teaching, and it is my distinct conviction that some of it is not only unbalanced but dangerous in its tendencies'.<a name=16:29></a> Nor am <i>I</i> alone involved in this: the brethren who were present at the Chicago meetings, all of whom, I may say, professed to enjoy what came out; and also those in different parts of this country, and Canada, who have read and received the Notes without adverse criticism are also responsible.<a name=16:30></a> This may not have occurred to you, but it is nevertheless a very glaring fact.<a name=16:31></a> It is true indeed that most of the saints on this side are much

		I hardly know what to say as to your remark: 'Scripture never gives it (the assembly) the place of Christ, even for us'.<a name=19:3></a> I cannot but think that you believe that the church takes the place of Christ down here in many respects.<a name=19:4></a> Take for instance, the "temple of God".<a name=19:5></a> Christ was this when here; now the church is it.<a name=19:6></a> When the Lord was here it could be said, "God had visited His people".<a name=19:7></a> Now God is here in the church; (I need not quote the Scriptures supporting this).<a name=19:8></a> When Christ was here the kingdom was here: "The kingdom of God is among you;" now it is here in the church.<a name=19:9></a> Christ had "authority" to forgive sins: He committed this authority to the church.<a name=19:10></a> Finally, according to <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9">Acts  9</a>and <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>, the church is Himself.<a name=19:11></a> To my mind the statement I am referring to tends to weaken the whole truth of Christianity.<a name=19:12></a> I regard it as fundamental that there was a revival in the church of the power that came out in Christ personally when here in the flesh; and in an excessive way.<a name=19:13></a> "Greater works shall ye do, because I go to the Father".<a name=19:14></a> I cannot understand how anyone can read the early chapters of the Acts without seeing this.<a name=19:15></a> The power of God was here for good as it had been seen in Christ, only in a more extensive manner, as I said.<a name=19:16></a> Of course, it was still exercised by Christ, but He accredits them with it.<a name=19:17></a> "Greater works shall ye do".<a name=19:18></a> You say, 'Even for us', the 'even' of course means that if not for us, certainly for no one else.<a name=19:19></a> The weakness of this strikes me greatly.<a name=19:20></a> I feel how that which the Lord intended to represent Him, and which was to be the expression of Himself down here (that which He calls "MY assembly;" this body: that which had walls great and high, and bulwarks and towers of strength, etc.<a name=19:21></a>) is slighted.<a name=19:22></a> Did not the man at the gate of the temple (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#3">Acts  3</a>) find those who took the place of Christ down here?<a name=19:23></a> If the Lord had been there He would have healed him; but Peter says "Look on <i>us</i> .<a name=19:24></a>.<a name=19:25></a>.<a name=19:26></a> such as <i>I have</i> give I thee".<a name=19:27></a> And so later, the shadow of Peter.<a name=19:28></a> The power was in the name of Jesus but it was identified with the saints.<a name=19:29></a> Of course, this

		Christ is the Vessel of the blessing of Abraham, and that everything that God has for man comes through Him; but my object was to show how it arrives in a practical way at the Gentiles.<a name=27:1></a> It was through the church.<a name=27:2></a> It is puerile to ask me for a text (I intend to furnish scriptures): what I say is simply the statement of a fact presented in the Acts.<a name=27:3></a> What was ministered to the Gentiles (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3:5">Galatians  3:5</a>) was in the church before its being ministered to them.<a name=27:4></a> Now, I do not mean that the church ministered it: all I mean to convey is that <i>what was ministered</i> was in the church prior to its reaching the Gentiles.<a name=27:5></a> As to a scripture, <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>is what I should quote: the Spirit <i>was</i> there in the church, and the announcement was that those who repented, etc.<a name=27:6></a>, would receive forgiveness and the Spirit.<a name=27:7></a> The Samaritans also received the Spirit; not <i>directly</i> from the Lord, but through the administration of the apostles.<a name=27:8></a> The same holds good as to Saul (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9">Acts  9</a>).<a name=27:9></a> Although the Lord spoke to him outside Damascus, He did not preach the gospel to him <i>there</i>, nor give him the Spirit.<a name=27:10></a> Ananias <i>laid his hands</i> on him, and in this <i>way</i> he received the Holy Spirit (from Christ, of course).<a name=27:11></a> Cornelius also is further evidence as to how particular God was that the testimony of the gospel and what was consequent on it were to stand connected with the church.<a name=27:12></a> It is true it was Peter and his "words" that were in question (the church does not teach or preach); but the apostles must always stand connected with the church (1 Corinthians 12: 28; <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:11">Ephesians  4:11</a>, 12).<a name=27:13></a> There is doubtless some significance in the fact that Peter did not lay his hands on Cornelius and his company, but at any rate the Holy Spirit who fell upon them had been before in the church.<a name=27:14></a> In every case, of course, it was Christ, or God, who gave the Spirit: I do not call this in question at all; the point is, <i>where</i> the Spirit was who was given and the <i>mode</i> God used in giving Him.<a name=27:15></a> I am not discontented with the way Scripture puts the truth.<a name=27:16></a> "Acts" is scripture.<a name=27:17></a> It presents the <i>facts</i> connected with the establishment of the church and the promulgation of the gospel, and if we are to be intelligent as to these we must pay attention to that book.<a name=27:18></a>

		I have had this in view in speaking of the blessing of Abraham.<a name=28:1></a> The psalm begins with unity: then both the ointment and the dew are seen <i>descending</i> -- all pointing to the gift of the Spirit from Christ on high.<a name=28:2></a> The dew descends on Zion, and <i>there</i> the blessing is commanded.<a name=28:3></a> Now <i>all</i> Scripture is profitable for <i>doctrine</i>, and, whatever question may be under consideration, the Scriptures which treat of it should be considered.<a name=28:4></a> What then may we understand from <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#133">Psalm  133</a>?<a name=28:5></a> It is clear to me that while it speaks, <i>strictly</i>, of what is future, it has also application to the church.<a name=28:6></a> The conditions (Scripture supposes that we should <i>compare</i> things), were all there on the day of Pentecost, and the coming of the Holy Spirit involved the blessing being "commanded" -- at least in the sense in which we have eternal life in the present time.<a name=28:7></a> Zion was God's "desired" dwelling-place.<a name=28:8></a> The church is this now, and where God dwells the blessing is.<a name=28:9></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#134:3">Psalm  134:3</a> says, "The Lord .<a name=28:10></a>.<a name=28:11></a>.<a name=28:12></a> <i>bless thee out of Zion</i>".<a name=28:13></a> What follows chapter 2 in Acts corresponds with this.<a name=28:14></a> We should also own the force of <i>all</i> Scripture as to salvation.<a name=28:15></a> The New Testament says it is in Christ, but <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#46:13">Isaiah  46:13</a> says, "I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory".<a name=28:16></a> You may say that Zion is a risen Christ: it does not always mean just this (see <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#48">Psalm  48</a>).<a name=28:17></a>

		My Dear Brother, -- When writing last I did not have time to refer to the agitation which the Notes (Chicago) of the meetings for which I am mainly responsible have occasioned.<a name=31:9></a> While from the outset I had the assurance that the Notes did not contain error, I was aware of inaccurate and unguarded expressions, which were well understood when given out orally, but which might easily be misconstrued by a reader who did not attend the meetings, especially if such an one was not acquainted with the speaker.<a name=31:10></a> _ All this (although quite unforeseen) is what has actually happened and as my brethren have been caused anxiety and sorrow I feel I am blameworthy.<a name=31:11></a> I hope it will be understood that I am deeply pained that any of the Lord's people should have had conflict which forethought and caution on my part might have averted.<a name=31:12></a> But it should be borne in mind that the Notes were primarily intended for brethren on this Continent, and as most of them are acquainted with Mr.<a name=31:13></a> Pellatt and myself and do not suspect either of us of bad doctrine, it was never anticipated that there would be serious criticism, indeed as a matter of fact there had been none that I am aware of until the objections from your side began to appear and even since, with one or two exceptions, there has not been anything serious.<a name=31:14></a> I mention this specially because my belief is that the difficulty has arisen largely from the form of expression employed and want of apprehension on the part of those objecting as to the point of view taken.<a name=31:15></a> The fact that those who are acquainted with the manner of giving out the truth of the speakers represented in the Notes, have little or no difficulty is, I think, a proof of this.<a name=31:16></a> I would mention further (as I did in a previous letter) that the Notes came to me to look over at a time when I was under the greatest pressure from stress of business, and hence I was
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=32>[Page 32]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		hindered in giving them proper attention.<a name=32:1></a> I went over them very superficially and I see now that I should have held them back until I had more time, but as I said, I had no anticipation of criticisms; I regarded the Notes as semi-private, and quite believed that they would be read in a charitable spirit by those into whose hands they might come -- that they would be taken as intended for edification, and as calling attention in a pointed way to what the Lord had revived through the ministry of others.<a name=32:2></a> There is nothing further from my mind than that anything in the Notes should be dogmatic, but at the same time I believe that what they contain is substantially the truth which the Lord has been calling our attention to for some years, and I am convinced that where it is refused an irreparable loss will be sustained.<a name=32:3></a> I am very far from expecting that my elder brethren should pay especial attention to anything one so young as I might have to say, but I think that to which the ministry of those now at rest called attention should be considered and contended for.<a name=32:4></a> The church's heavenly calling as united to Christ was pressed, also the great fact of its existence down here at the present time in the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=32:5></a> The former is now being pushed forward, but the latter as a <i>practical sphere</i> of protection and blessing for souls is being largely ignored.<a name=32:6></a> This explains the point of view in the Chicago Notes.<a name=32:7></a> There was not the intention to belittle the heavenly side, but the need of insisting on it did not exist.<a name=32:8></a> <i>Now</i> I see that much should have been added in the way of guarding and explanation, and would have been, had criticism been anticipated.<a name=32:9></a> Many things have been alleged as taught in the Notes which are entirely foreign to my mind and I am certain I never gave expression to them.<a name=32:10></a> The more important of these are:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1st.<a name=32:11></a> That the church is an 'earth-dweller' and that through her Christ is also made such.<a name=32:12></a> His session at the right hand of God being ignored, beclouded and hidden.<a name=32:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2nd.<a name=32:14></a> That the church is presented as an object of faith in the gospel, and that instead of Christ, she is the giver of living water.<a name=32:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3rd.<a name=32:16></a> That living water is located in the saints, instead of in Christ.<a name=32:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I refuse all this as contrary to Scripture.<a name=32:18></a> It never had a place in my mind.<a name=32:19></a> As to the first, I believe the church's distinctive place is in heaven, or the heavenlies, and that she
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=33>[Page 33]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		will never be seen actually on earth again after the rapture; that even now she is the body of Christ and united to Him in heaven.<a name=33:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But she is actually here on earth in testimony and, as Christ's body she is Himself morally (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:14">Acts  9:14</a>).<a name=33:2></a> But although here the earth is not her place; heaven is her place although in the future she is ever seen <i>in relation</i> to the earth, at the present time the church forms the sphere in which Christ is known and enjoyed, but the associations are all heavenly having Him at the right hand of God as the centre.<a name=33:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the second, I believe Christ alone is presented as the Object of faith in the gospel and that He is the giver of living water.<a name=33:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The third allegation may have an apparent support in the Notes, but this can only be by inference that because living water is located in the saints it is denied that it is in Christ.<a name=33:5></a> It <i>is</i> in Christ, and to say that it is in the saints down here does not weaken this in the least degree while it presents the living water as <i>practically</i> available for man at the present time.<a name=33:6></a> The living water is in the assembly, but it is not in the assembly <i>instead</i> of in Christ.<a name=33:7></a> It seems to be forgotten that the assembly itself is in Christ.<a name=33:8></a> In what appears in the Notes on this point my thought was not that the locating of the living water <i>in the saints</i> was by the <i>preaching</i>, but rather that the preachers should do this (I did not say <i>how</i>) for souls.<a name=33:9></a> In preaching, <i>Christ</i> should be presented as the One through whom every blessing comes.<a name=33:10></a> The locating of things in detail comes in afterward.<a name=33:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In conclusion I would say that with the aid of some on this side and in England, I have made a revision of the Notes, and I hope they will soon appear in print.<a name=33:12></a> Had they been properly revised at the outset I should have thought it best to print them in the form in which they had been criticised, with needed marginal explanations, but as they stood they were, from a literary point of view, entirely unfit for publication.<a name=33:13></a> Besides as they are being printed chiefly with the hope that they may be found helpful to the saints, it is but proper they should be as accurate as possible, and that all extraneous matter should be removed.<a name=33:14></a>

		I see that you quite misunderstand the trend of thought in the Notes of the New York meetings regarding the church's relation to the earth.<a name=38:11></a> It was entirely a question of <i>testimony</i>.<a name=38:12></a> The Son of God was said to have come into the sphere of testimony, and that having come He did not leave it <i>morally;</i> the earth was said to be the scene of the testimony at the <i>present time</i> and the church is here in this connection.<a name=38:13></a> But (although it was not expressed at that reading) my thought as to the entire sphere of testimony is that it includes the heavens as well, hence when I spoke of the church being removed for a time, but that morally it was not removed at all I meant simply that it would come into view again: it would appear in the scene of testimony again, but in the heavenly part of it.<a name=38:14></a> In a subsequent reading (on <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2">Ephesians  2</a>) you might have seen that this was what was held.<a name=38:15></a> The statement you give from the Notes is misquoted in the essential part of it.<a name=38:16></a> You underline the words 'from earth' as proving your point, and these words do not appear in the passage at all in this connection.<a name=38:17></a> It is true you say you had not the Notes by you to refer to, but this misquotation of an essential passage only proves your misapprehension of what they contain.<a name=38:18></a>

		I can scarcely understand your remarks that your objection to Christ being connected with the earth through the church, did not refer to the world to come, but to the present time.<a name=38:19></a> I could never have divined that you referred to the present time, for it did not occur to me that any Christian would deny that the church is not only <i>connected</i> with the earth now, but actually <i>on</i> it -- which latter will not be true in the coming age.<a name=38:20></a> The church <i>is</i> on the earth; it was formed primarily at Jerusalem, and is spoken of at Corinth, Ephesus, etc.<a name=38:21></a> These cities were on earth.<a name=38:22></a> The assembly at Corinth was said to be Christ's body.<a name=38:23></a> It was not Christ's body in heaven; it was His body in that city; and if His body He was in it, and in it to be expressed morally <i>there</i>.<a name=38:24></a> "Know ye not your own selves how that Jesus Christ is in you".<a name=38:25></a> Further, Saul was not persecuting Christ in heaven, but here on earth.<a name=38:26></a> Christ was here on earth morally in the saints, and was expressed in testimony before the world.<a name=38:27></a> In the Revelation He is seen in the midst of the

		Beloved Brother, -- You need not have any fear of wearying me with any questions that you may feel necessary to ask.<a name=44:16></a> I have some idea of the exercises many of you must be going through at the present time; and as I fear I am far from considering myself as exempt from responsibility in the matter, I feel bound to do all I can to relieve the situation.<a name=44:17></a> As to my thought of the Christian circle (I hardly ever use the expression; I usually use 'church' or 'assembly' ) being the meeting at Brooklyn, I would say that this is not so, and if Mr.<a name=44:18></a> Boyd asserts that I hold such a miserable thought, he should produce evidence of it; but the necessity of substantiating reports by adequate proofs does not appear to be felt by Mr.<a name=44:19></a> Boyd .<a name=44:20></a>.<a name=44:21></a>.<a name=44:22></a> [J.<a name=44:23></a>T.<a name=44:24></a> here quotes proof from the 'Notes' Ans.<a name=44:25></a> J.<a name=44:26></a>T.<a name=44:27></a> 'Yes, I think it is our privilege to be in the light of it but you can never be it'.<a name=44:28></a> -- Ed] .<a name=44:29></a>.<a name=44:30></a>.<a name=44:31></a> .<a name=44:32></a> In the Woodstock Readings there is an expression like this, 'You hear the expression' assembly 'here and there, but God never intended to restore any church position', so that the charge that I reduce the church to a visible company now is unfounded and absolutely false.<a name=44:33></a> What I see is that the incoming of the Holy Spirit formed an entirely new order of things, a sphere was formed in which the blessed activities of the Spirit were known.<a name=44:34></a> This was the assembly which for a time appeared intact in the world, but the ruin has intervened and now the church cannot be seen in any concrete

		Beloved Brother, -- Since writing my last I have had time to weigh the question of the withdrawal of the unrevised notes of meetings held in New York last year.<a name=45:22></a> I had partly decided to do this three months ago, but hesitated then because I did not wish that those who appreciated the line of thought contained in them (and I had abundant evidence that there were many such), should be deprived of what they valued as the truth.<a name=45:23></a> I cherished the hope that I should be enabled to furnish satisfactory explanations of the points objected to; and indeed I may say, that as far as difficulties have been presented to me directly, I have succeeded in this.<a name=45:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Notwithstanding, however, I feel that as the Notes were not
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=46>[Page 46]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		properly revised, and as they do not <i>accurately</i> represent the thought of some of the speakers, and of myself in particular, and as they contain expressions which, being unguarded, are capable of misconstruction, and more especially as they have become in this form the subject of public controversy, fairness to all concerned, demands that they should be withdrawn, <i>as they stand</i>.<a name=46:1></a> It is not that they contain anything wrong, but some of the expressions alluded to above, have been torn away from their context and grouped together in such fashion as to lead some to conclude that a system of error is being taught; hence godly care for souls would lead to the removal of what in this way is being used to harass and distress the Lord's people.<a name=46:2></a> Had it not been that much they contain as truth, and which I believe the Lord would call special attention to at the present time, is <i>now</i> in print and before the saints, I should have felt it needful to revise carefully the Notes in question and publish them, so that all might be in a position to judge as to what is really held, but this is not necessary on account of the publication of the Notes of the Chicago meetings.<a name=46:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would ask you, dear brother, kindly to make known to those with whom you may be in communication that these Notes are withdrawn for the reasons stated above, and in doing so, I feel it is but seemly for me to say that while I am acting with a view to peace and the restoration of confidence among the saints, yet the admissions made above involve a measure of failure on my part, for had proper care been exercised at the beginning, this act might not now be necessary.<a name=46:4></a> Hence, as on a former occasion, I would again express my very great regret for any sorrow occasioned my brethren which more care on my part might have averted.<a name=46:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I can understand it being said that such an acknowledgment as I now make is not enough; that I should confess that error exists, but I am utterly unconscious that it does, and, until its existence is proved, it is impossible for me to admit it.<a name=46:6></a> It is not that I claim unconsciousness of error vindicates me, I do not; but while I am unconscious of it, it is, as I said, impossible for me to admit its existence; and until the presence of evil in the Notes is attested, I can say no more than I have said above.<a name=46:7></a> It is true that we are to be justified or condemned by our words, but if statements are made which although said to be one-sided or unbalanced, are at the same time supported by Scripture, they cannot be called error.<a name=46:8></a> This is especially
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=47>[Page 47]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the case if the balancing truths are found elsewhere from the same speaker, and the different Notes which have been criticised abound with this very thing.<a name=47:1></a> For instance, the Son of God is said to have come, and come to stay, and 'The church is here to stay'.<a name=47:2></a> What was the thought behind those expressions?<a name=47:3></a> By reference to other statements in the Notes it can be seen that it is held that Christ is literally in heaven, and that the church's place is there also; hence, 'here' <i>cannot</i> be intended to mean the earth alone, but the heavens as well, as included in the sphere of testimony.<a name=47:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will not say more, only to add that in withdrawing the Notes as they stand, it is as reserving the right to use them in part or as a whole, if this be deemed necessary in the future, as properly revised Notes of two of the meetings have been already revised and published under the titles respectively of 'Christ in Authority', and 'Christ crowned by the Father and by the saints'.<a name=47:5></a> These, of course, are not withdrawn.<a name=47:6></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the body of your letter, I am somewhat at a loss to know what to say, for I do not see that I can add anything, as to the points you raise, to what I have said in the revised Notes, especially in the preface -- a copy of which I had sent you.<a name=48:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You say: 'If .<a name=48:6></a>.<a name=48:7></a>.<a name=48:8></a> the Spirit is never dissociated from Christ who gives it, then it must be to Christ you turn, and to Him where He actually is in Person, and not to the saints or the assembly'.<a name=48:9></a> This is exactly what <i>I</i> say substantially, as the following extracts show: 'In order to drink, each one must come to Christ, the Source and Giver'.<a name=48:10></a> 'It would be wrong to imply that the church is the giver of living water.<a name=48:11></a> Christ is the Giver of living water'.<a name=48:12></a> Your remarks, therefore, are a sorrow to me, for you do not seem to accredit what I say.<a name=48:13></a> You may reply that other statements of mine are different.<a name=48:14></a> I certainly do not know of any such.<a name=48:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then you say: 'This, as I see it, is the root error, which vitiates what might otherwise be good'.<a name=48:16></a> That is, you charge me with something as root error which is the exact opposite of what I affirm in the plainest English!<a name=48:17></a> But I have never thought or said that the saints give living water (although I have made full allowance for certain instances in the Acts, of the Spirit being communicated through the administration of men); my point all through being to emphasise that the living water was here, <i>and this in order that saints should become exercised as to it</i>.<a name=48:18></a> I have <i>always</i> (of course) held that Christ is the Giver of living water, as of every blessing; but what I have felt is that the <i>administrative</i> position of the assembly, as set up by the Lord at the beginning, is not understood; hence if anyone were to say in a limited way that the Holy Spirit was given <i>through</i> men at the beginning I could not deny it.<a name=48:19></a> But I only say this as guarding the side of the truth which I have mentioned, and as making full allowance for the authority of all Scripture; and I would always feel it needful in making such a remark to emphasise that Christ is the real Source and Giver.<a name=48:20></a> I have in

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the living water, I am surprised that you should think that it is limited to the 'effects' of the Spirit, but I am glad that you are not dogmatic about it, for in the light of John 4 and 7 I cannot see that the thought is scriptural; indeed I am sure it is <i>not</i> scriptural.<a name=49:8></a> John 7 does not say, 'This spake He of the <i>effects</i> of the Spirit', but "This spake He of <i>the Spirit</i>".<a name=49:9></a> Then in John 4 the Lord said that the water that He would give would become in the recipient a fountain of water springing up.<a name=49:10></a> How are we to understand that the Lord would give to the woman the 'effects' of the Spirit?<a name=49:11></a> or that the spring in the believer is the effects of the Spirit?<a name=49:12></a> The Lord alluded to the Spirit Himself, and to say the contrary would, to my mind, weaken the whole passage, and indeed tend to rob us of Christianity in the real power of it.<a name=49:13></a> I fully own that the effects of the Spirit are <i>included</i> in the living water, especially as flowing out of the believer, but the living water as given to the disciples by Christ, was the Holy Spirit personally, and this should be insisted on.<a name=49:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Your remark as to the Holy Spirit not entirely leaving heaven is, I must say, very peculiar, and I beg you to excuse me if I say that it will jar on any mind conversant with the teaching of Scripture; and that any views based on it will only tend to confusion, if not to error.<a name=49:15></a> For myself, I may say that I have always believed that the Holy Spirit is a Divine Person, equal with the Father and the Son, and <i>ever</i> in the Godhead; so I would not restrict Him, as thus viewed, to any sphere, but I want to be governed by Scripture, and there I find that Christ being glorified the Spirit is here -- "sent down from heaven".<a name=49:16></a> Till Jesus was glorified the Spirit "was not yet", but now He is here <i>Personally</i> as that other Comforter who abides with

	<div class="paragraph">
		us forever, and it is as here in the church that He is spoken of in the New Testament, and not as in heaven.<a name=50:1></a> Of course, the Spirit is in Christ as Man in heaven, but until it is shown from Scripture that souls have received Him <i>from heaven</i> since Pentecost I shall hold that all persons who have received the Spirit since He came to the 120 as seen in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>, have received Him as thus already here.<a name=50:2></a> In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10">Acts  10</a>, indeed He was "poured out" on the Gentiles, but it does not say that He was poured out from heaven.<a name=50:3></a> In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>the sound of "a rushing, mighty wind" is out of heaven.<a name=50:4></a> But He is never disassociated from Christ.<a name=50:5></a> He is in Christ in heaven, but at the same time He is acting as a distinct Divine Person here on earth (we cannot undertake to explain this), and it is in the latter position, as I have said, that He is spoken of in connection with Christianity.<a name=50:6></a>

		What I gave out at the different meetings of which reports were made was the outcome of lengthened exercise as to the popular mode of presenting the gospel.<a name=51:9></a> I had observed that to a very large extent the necessity for a witness to it was entirely ignored, and it was because of this that the line of thought turned so much on what was down here.<a name=51:10></a> There was not the faintest notion of disregarding or beclouding the heavenly side of the truth, but it was not felt that the need for pressing it existed at that time, nor was there the least intention to detract from the glory of Christ as the blessed One through whom alone every blessing comes, the general thought being to set forth (if possible) the conditions under which the gospel was announced at the beginning.<a name=51:11></a> And I had much exercise as to the current view of heaven, feeling that human imagination had a good deal to do in the formation of it.<a name=51:12></a> I have never had the least doubt that the church's calling is heavenly, that its place is in heaven, but my exercise has been to make it clear that it is ever seen in relation to the earth in the future, though not on it.<a name=51:13></a> It is not spoken of in Scripture as being in some

		Judging by certain statements and quotations which you make, I am disposed to think that, in the main, you hold pretty much what I do on the subjects you are dealing with; save that I lay stress on certain features which you would tend to minimise or ignore entirely.<a name=52:16></a> Speaking of the kingdom, you say: 'It means direction and guidance from the hand of the Lord as well as the support of the Spirit of God for the believer'.<a name=52:17></a> Then you quote from some one: 'The kingdom involves two things: <i>the preaching</i> of a sphere of power and blessing .<a name=52:18></a>.<a name=52:19></a>.<a name=52:20></a> .<a name=52:21></a> The power and blessing were brought in by Jesus when here; power delivers from evil, Satan and death'.<a name=52:22></a> These statements convey substantially what I understand as to the kingdom, and what they contain forms the basis of all I have said in the Notes to which you so strongly object.<a name=52:23></a> But you add to the first remark: 'The truth of it (the kingdom) is essentially individual'.<a name=52:24></a> Here I cannot say that I concur, for the statement is scarcely intelligible.<a name=52:25></a> In the quotation you give the kingdom is said to be 'a sphere of power and blessing'.<a name=52:26></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A sphere is not an individual.<a name=53:1></a> The realisation of it, as of every truth, is individual, but the 'sphere of power and blessing' must be there before it can be realised or entered into.<a name=53:2></a> This sphere existed when the Lord was here by the fact of His presence, and now that He has gone to heaven it is maintained here by the Holy Spirit.<a name=53:3></a> It is remarkable that the Lord explains (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#12">Matthew  12</a>) that the <i>proof</i> that the kingdom had come was that He cast out devils by the Spirit of God.<a name=53:4></a> This passage helps greatly to a true understanding of the import of the kingdom of God: it stands connected with a divine Person here on earth, while the kingdom of heaven involves more authority vested in Christ in heaven.<a name=53:5></a> It was the former that was in view mainly in the Notes, and this is the reason why the church is referred to so much, as being the vessel in which the Spirit has been active, since the Lord went on high.<a name=53:6></a> During the Woodstock meetings, <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13">Matthew  13</a>was a good deal on my mind, and the kingdom there is presented as a sphere here on earth, <i>out</i> of which, at the end, the "tares" are taken.<a name=53:7></a> It did not occur to me that anyone would suspect that the heavenly side was doubted, otherwise it would have been made <i>more</i> prominent, although it <i>is</i> maintained throughout.<a name=53:8></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You say (page 1), 'What struck me, in going through this reading of yours on the kingdom, was the entire absence of any reference to its having been established in the Lord Jesus Christ at God's right hand <i>in heaven</i>'.<a name=53:10></a> You could not have read very carefully or you would have seen that the kingdom is said to be established in Christ, and that Christ is said to have ascended above all heavens.<a name=53:11></a> If you look at page 8 you will find this statement: 'It is a question of what is established in Jesus our Lord as risen from the dead;' and on page 11 the kingdom is said to involve 'His ascension far above all heavens'.<a name=53:12></a> Hence you were struck with the absence of something that was really present!<a name=53:13></a> I have wondered whether you have been struck with the fact that the apostle in writing to the Romans about the kingdom (chapter 5, which was the chapter under consideration at the reading in question), does not say that it was established in Christ in heaven.<a name=53:14></a> The word 'heaven' occurs but twice in the whole epistle, and in neither instance is it connected with the kingdom.<a name=53:15></a> But in saying this I only wish to call attention to the manner in which things are presented in Scripture; I do not mean to weaken the truth that

		the kingdom is established in Christ in heaven -- which is taught in the 'Notes', as I have pointed out.<a name=54:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On page 2 of your letter you labour energetically to make out that I put the saints in the place of Christ in the proclamation of the gospel, quoting: 'The gospel refers much more to what is down here than to what is in heaven'.<a name=54:2></a> Now, in saying this I did not have the proclamation in my mind at all; I was referring simply to the <i>things</i> alluded to in the gospel, such as the kingdom, house, salvation, etc.<a name=54:3></a>, all of which I hold to be here in connection with the presence of the Holy Spirit.<a name=54:4></a> If the thought of the proclamation did enter my mind it was expressed in the remark which immediately follows the one mentioned above so as to guard it: 'It is true that Christ is the Theme'.<a name=54:5></a> Did you attach its proper value to this remark, and to another which appears on the same page ( 'The great theme of the apostles was that these wonderful things had come to pass through the humble Nazarene, whom the Jews had crucified, but whom God had raised up and exalted to His right hand' ), you could never have asked me such a question as 'Have the saints died for me?<a name=54:6></a>' Neither could you treat as you do my remark: 'God's intervention is in the saints'.<a name=54:7></a> You deal with this statement as if it were the only one I had made: you attach a meaning to it which is utterly at variance with its context.<a name=54:8></a> How could I <i>mean</i> by 'intervention' anything absolute or primary, when I say in 'the same breath' that Christ is the Theme of the gospel and that all these wonderful things for men had been brought to pass by Him?<a name=54:9></a> I was simply stating the historical fact presented in the Acts: the Lord Jesus Christ had gone to the right hand of God, having accomplished the work of redemption; but humanity (save the few in the upper room at Jerusalem) was still in darkness, and captive to Satan.<a name=54:10></a> How did God meet this condition of things?<a name=54:11></a> By the light and power consequent on the incoming of the Holy Spirit to the 120.<a name=54:12></a> Who dares to deny this?<a name=54:13></a> He who does speaks injuriously against the Holy Spirit.<a name=54:14></a> But all this light and power in the Spirit down here is consequent on the precious atoning work of our Lord Jesus Christ, and His exaltation to the right hand of God; and in the proclamation of the gospel I should present Him, and Him alone, as the One in whom God has intervened for the deliverance and blessing of men.<a name=54:15></a> But although I said I did not have the proclamation in my mind in speaking of the things referred

	<div class="paragraph">
		to in the gospel, yet I do not admit that any restrictions can be placed on the preacher as to what he may present in testimony.<a name=55:1></a> In writing to the Romans Paul presents the gospel: he presents the righteousness and power of God, which are seen respectively in the death and resurrection of Christ; and consequent on these, things are seen as administered <i>through</i> our Lord Jesus Christ, which involves the love of God shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, which is given to us, ending in eternal life -- the field covered is large.<a name=55:2></a> Then in writing to the Ephesians the apostle says, "To me .<a name=55:3></a>.<a name=55:4></a>.<a name=55:5></a> has this grace been given, to announce among the <i>nations</i> the glad tidings of the unsearchable <i>riches</i> of the Christ, and to enlighten all (with the knowledge of) what is the administration of the mystery" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:8">Ephesians  3:8</a>, 9).<a name=55:6></a> Here the glad tidings "announced" are of "riches" of Christ, of which the church surely forms a part, indeed it is what is immediately before the apostle here.<a name=55:7></a> He had said to the Corinthians that <i>Christ</i> was the wisdom of God, but here the all-various wisdom is to be seen by beings in the heavenlies in the <i>assembly</i>.<a name=55:8></a> Hence we see that although Christ was ever the theme of Paul's preaching, yet he 'referred' to <i>things</i> which are actually down here in what he announced.<a name=55:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the relation of the church to salvation is what more particularly demands attention.<a name=55:10></a> What I would say at the outset is, that we must be prepared to admit the force of all Scripture in regard to any subject under consideration if we are to get the mind of God as to it.<a name=55:11></a> Every scripture is "profitable for <i>doctrine</i>".<a name=55:12></a> Hence the instruction in the Old Testament relative to Jerusalem, or Zion, has to be taken into account in connection with the question of salvation.<a name=55:13></a> It is not that they typify the assembly exactly, but we have to 'compare' things, and every one instructed by the Spirit would recognise that nothing in the way of power or blessing is predicted of Jerusalem or Zion that is not applicable also to the assembly.<a name=55:14></a> Glorious things were spoken of Jerusalem, and the Songs of Degrees show that it was the great objective of the exercised remnant of Israel.<a name=55:15></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#133">Psalm  133</a>is the climax -- there the blessing is commanded; and in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#134">Psalm  134</a>we get "The Lord .<a name=55:16></a>.<a name=55:17></a>.<a name=55:18></a> bless thee out of Zion".<a name=55:19></a> Then, as to salvation we read in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#46:13">Isaiah  46:13</a>, "I will place salvation in Zion;" and <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#60:18">Isaiah  60:18</a>, "Thou shalt call thy walls Salvation" (see also <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#48">Psalm  48</a>).<a name=55:20></a> Now, if we compare all this with <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>we readily see that what marked Jerusalem in an external way was realised in a
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=56>[Page 56]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		spiritual sense in the assembly.<a name=56:1></a> <i>God was dwelling in it</i>, hence security against evil and blessing were to be found there.<a name=56:2></a> Instead of finding salvation in Jerusalem, as they will be in a future day, the remnant of Israel found it in the assembly: "The Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:47">Acts  2:47</a>).<a name=56:3></a> But, of course, before being added each one had to have faith in the Lord as presented to him in the gospel; as Peter says, "Repent, and be baptized <i>every one</i> of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:38">Acts  2:38</a>).<a name=56:4></a> I would add that in speaking of salvation from this point of view, I do not, of course, include deliverance from coming wrath, or the lake of fire.<a name=56:5></a> I am speaking of it as it is to be realised at the present time, and the believer always has the knowledge that on account of his faith in Christ he will not come into judgment.<a name=56:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The contradiction which you think you have discovered in my statements as to living water, disappears when the statements are carefully examined.<a name=56:7></a> The first, 'the believer was to be the source of supply', is simply the Lord's own remark, as recorded in <a href="../bible/John.htm#7:38">John  7:38</a>, "Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water", only in other words, for no thoughtful person would deny for a moment that <i>rivers</i> may be a source of supply to those who need water.<a name=56:8></a> But although rivers may be a source of supply to those who need water, they are not their own source: a city may get its supply of water from a river, but the source of the river may be hundreds of miles away in some lake or mountain-spring.<a name=56:9></a> This latter is what I had in my mind when I said that Christ is the Source and Giver of living water.<a name=56:10></a> The water comes from Christ in glory to the believer, and from him it flows out as rivers.<a name=56:11></a> But it must be remembered that John 7 contemplates the coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost ("the Holy Spirit was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified"), and that consequently all who have received Him since have received Him as thus here.<a name=56:12></a> In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10">Acts  10</a>, indeed, it says that He was poured out on the Gentiles, but it does not say that He was poured out <i>from heaven</i>.<a name=56:13></a> Whatever may be said as to the effects of the Spirit in the believer being living water (which I admit fully), John 7 is conclusive that it is the Holy Spirit Himself.<a name=56:14></a> "This spake he <i>of the Spirit</i>, which they that believe on Him should receive".<a name=56:15></a> It is, however, the Spirit in a certain character, i.<a name=56:16></a>e.<a name=56:17></a> as in man, and so adaptable to the need of the human heart.<a name=56:18></a> But the living

		Your comments on my expression, 'Sinners come in afterwards', have no force at all, as the context shows that I only used the word 'sinners' as covering a class of persons who had stood in need of the gospel, and, being affected by it, come into the house of God.<a name=57:2></a> The apostle Paul referred to himself as a sinner long after he had been converted -- "sinners; of whom I <i>am</i> chief" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#1:15">1 Timothy  1:15</a>).<a name=57:3></a>

		Beloved Brother, -- I quite go with your remarks as to Luke's gospel.<a name=63:8></a> Luke presents Christ as here on the <i>part of God</i>, and in all that He does and says, He makes it evident that God had intervened for man's good.<a name=63:9></a> At the end of chapter 10 and in chapter 11 He is seen as Teacher -- the disciples taking the place as learners.<a name=63:10></a> In His instruction as to prayer He shows that the greatest possible gift, the Holy Spirit, is obtained through it.<a name=63:11></a> But it is the <i>Father</i> who is of, or in, heaven, who gives this gift.<a name=63:12></a> The gospel brings the light of God to man's soul, and the effect of this is that man has confidence in God which is expressed in prayer.<a name=63:13></a> It is the attitude the soul takes before God, and God's answer is the gift of the Spirit.<a name=63:14></a> What I have observed is, that there is a tendency to restrict God -- that He gives the Spirit only in a prescribed way.<a name=63:15></a> But there is no prescribed way.<a name=63:16></a> The scripture shows that He gives the Spirit in answer to prayer, and also that He gives Him sovereignly to believers to seal them as His property.<a name=63:17></a> I feel that it is of great advantage that saints should be exercised in regard to prayer.<a name=63:18></a> Divine things are too lightly valued and hence they are not possessed.<a name=63:19></a> When we value a divine gift we ask for it, and Luke 11 would encourage us to keep on asking till we get it.<a name=63:20></a> Jacob represents those who appreciate the divine blessing: "I will not let thee go, except thou bless me" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#32:26">Genesis  32:26</a>).<a name=63:21></a> Christ recovered everything in principle through death and resurrection, but it is evident that there could be no subjective recovery unless the Lord can give the Spirit to man.<a name=63:22></a> God obtains the response which He seeks from man in virtue of man having received the Spirit from Christ.<a name=63:23></a> Our Head is a life-giving Spirit.<a name=63:24></a>

		As to the elders praying, the remarks made are, in measure, supported in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#5">Revelation  5</a>, but then the "saints" whose prayers are referred to would not be those in the church; therefore it is hard to make the principle apply at the present time, seeing there are no saints on earth now save those who form the church.<a name=68:10></a> Still it is true, I am sure, that those who are in the position of elders carry in their <i>hearts</i> (this would more answer to the bowls) before God the needs and prayers of the saints.<a name=68:11></a> But it has to be noted that the living creatures also have bowls, so that the thought is not confined to the saints viewed as elders.<a name=68:12></a> Moreover, what is said is that they <i>have</i> the golden bowls -- nothing is mentioned as to the use made of them.<a name=68:13></a> Besides, they are vials or bowls, not censers; and the golden altar is not in view as in <a href="../bible/chapter.htm#8:2">chapter  8:2</a> - 5.<a name=68:14></a> Here we have what is more official -- Christ is seen as Priest giving effect to the prayers of saints on the golden altar.<a name=68:15></a>

		Since your letter arrived <i>Mutual Comfort</i> for September has come, and I have looked at your article 'In the Midst' as you requested.<a name=69:14></a> Probably you will anticipate that I have difficulty in going with some of the things said.<a name=69:15></a> I am unable to see that there is any scripture for saying that the Lord's presence in the midst of His own refers to them in any way but as convened.<a name=69:16></a> Certainly you do not cite any.<a name=69:17></a> As far as I know, each passage that contains the thought contemplates the saints as gathered together.<a name=69:18></a> According to my understanding, the words "in the midst" do not admit of anything else.<a name=69:19></a> Besides, to say that the Lord is in the midst of the saints generally in a continuous way destroys the moral force of <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:20">Matthew  18:20</a>, and <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:23">John  14:23</a>.<a name=69:20></a>

		You speak rightly of <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>being pattern; but what part of the 'pattern' contemplates the Lord in the midst of His people not convened?<a name=69:21></a> On the first day mentioned they were together, and Jesus <i>came</i> and stood in the midst; then eight days afterwards they were together and Jesus <i>came again</i> and stood in the midst (verse 27).<a name=69:22></a> If there is pattern here it is pattern of Jesus in the midst <i>only</i> when the saints were gathered together.<a name=69:23></a> Had the Lord been "in the midst" during the six days that intervened how could it be said that He <i>came</i> in on the second first day of the week mentioned?<a name=69:24></a> No doubt Thomas may be regarded as representing the Jewish remnant, but the fact remains that the Lord came <i>twice</i> to the same company; and on each time it was when they were gathered together.<a name=69:25></a> I fail, therefore, to see how you can say that 'on His side it is not occasional nor recurrent, but continuous'.<a name=69:26></a> As to <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>, the Spirit was to come and abide "forever", but the Lord did not indicate this of Himself.<a name=69:27></a> I take "I am coming to you" to be characteristic rather than as referring

		This leads to the question of state, and I am altogether unable to follow you when you separate, as you do on page 226, between 'divinely formed state in the Spirit and practical state', making out (as I understand you) that the former by itself secures the Lord in the midst.<a name=70:7></a> I quite see that we have to distinguish between the work of God in us and our keeping ourselves from defilement -- cleansing ourselves from all filthiness of flesh and spirit -- but I would not intimate that the Lord could be in the midst where the latter was not maintained (compare <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#6:14">2 Corinthians  6:14</a> - 18).<a name=70:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		that in saying this, you are going beyond Scripture.<a name=71:1></a> Of course, the Lord is always <i>with</i> His people (that is, those who are walking in the truth and set for His interests), but this is another matter.<a name=71:2></a> He is with us as in service, individually or otherwise, or as seeking to help each other in readings and the like; and then He is <i>in</i> the assembly viewed as His body; and besides, as a divine Person, He dwells, by the Spirit, in the habitation of God here on earth -- but in all this we have not the thought of "in the midst", as presented in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>.<a name=71:3></a> In this chapter it is a question of the out-of-the-world, heavenly position of the assembly, as risen with Christ, dignified by the presence of the Lord in the midst.<a name=71:4></a> To my mind, this is what is obscured by the article in question; and your further remarks, and those of D.<a name=71:5></a>L.<a name=71:6></a>H.<a name=71:7></a>, which you quote, only confirm me that this is the tendency of the line of thought presented.<a name=71:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		John's line should be kept distinct, if we are to maintain the <i>privilege</i> side; Matthew has the maintenance of the testimony in view, and the structure, as that in which it is maintained, is set before us.<a name=71:9></a> In <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:18">Matthew  16:18</a> the Lord is not said to be in the midst, as you say, but "the gates of hell shall not prevail against <i>it</i>".<a name=71:10></a> The invulnerability of the structure as built by Him is before us, rather than a company with Him in the midst.<a name=71:11></a> In chapter 18 the smallest number, when <i>gathered together</i>, have Him in the midst.<a name=71:12></a> As I said before, if we say He is in the midst all the time, the force of the latter scripture is lost entirely.<a name=71:13></a> But here, as I apprehend, it is not privilege exactly, but we are assured of the Lord's presence in the way of support as engaged with His interests.<a name=71:14></a> And the Lord's word at the close of the gospel is on the same line -- He is with us always.<a name=71:15></a> This, of course, has a <i>general</i> application.<a name=71:16></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>we have Christ's brethren, and into the midst of these, as convened, He comes.<a name=71:17></a> This is unique, and shows the great end in view in John.<a name=71:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The fact is that I am altogether at a loss to see how the Lord could be said to be in the midst, as presented in this chapter, when the saints are separated, and following their individual vocations.<a name=71:19></a> To say that He is, to my mind, is confusing, and indeed, meaningless.<a name=71:20></a> But to look for the Lord to come into the midst of His people as gathered together, is a very proper and holy expectation.<a name=71:21></a>

		As to state, I quite see, as I said in my last letter, that we have to distinguish between the work of the Spirit in the

		believer and his practical ways, or walk.<a name=72:1></a> My difficulty is that you connect "in the midst;" with the former <i>by itself</i>.<a name=72:2></a> According to John's first epistle the two things are correlative.<a name=72:3></a> But then, Scripture also contemplates that a Christian, although a subject of God's work may turn aside; the work of the Spirit would remain (for what God does is done forever), but the man's practical ways would not correspond.<a name=72:4></a> Now according to your article "in the midst" would be true for this man although the practical state was wrong.<a name=72:5></a> It may be that I misunderstand you, but this is all I can make out of your remarks in this connection.<a name=72:6></a> And I feel therefore, that there is confusion; and besides, Open Brethren and independents generally would consider their position confirmed by the article.<a name=72:7></a> I think the distinction made in 1889 - 90 was between the believer's state viewed as in Christ and his 'mixed condition', as in the body, here on earth; e.<a name=72:8></a>g.<a name=72:9></a> <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#12">2 Corinthians  12</a>.<a name=72:10></a> Practical holiness was not so much in question.<a name=72:11></a> The most spiritual cannot avoid the mixed condition while in the body.<a name=72:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I may add that I feel very deeply concerned that a brother like Mr.<a name=83:4></a> Higgins should say that my 'line of argument is a dangerous one', especially as it involves what I have always held on the subject, and have spoken of it in many ways and places for years past.<a name=83:5></a> I do not think he could have given full consideration to my remarks on <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>, otherwise I do not see how he could say that 'J.<a name=83:6></a>T.<a name=83:7></a>'s thought is as plain as can be that the Lord Jesus comes and leaves the little meetings .<a name=83:8></a>.<a name=83:9></a>.<a name=83:10></a> and that this is the present and only fulfilment of <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>and 20'.<a name=83:11></a> In my letter to you I sought to show that chapter 14: 18 was normal -- 'things were in every way according to His mind, as we see in the Acts'.<a name=83:12></a> Then I said that subsequently the manifesting and coming were made conditional -- there would be defection and unfaithfulness, but to the faithful ones would be vouchsafed the privileges enjoyed when things were in order at the beginning.<a name=83:13></a> Surely there is plain discrimination here as to normal and abnormal conditions in the church, and this is in strict accord with the passage.<a name=83:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then Mr.<a name=83:15></a> H.<a name=83:16></a> says he hopes I 'would hasten to repudiate that these specified meetings have the privilege of the Lord's blessed presence all to themselves'.<a name=83:17></a> I never understood that any company, even the whole church on earth, could have the Lord's presence <i>all to themselves</i>.<a name=83:18></a> The Father has a claim on His presence, and angels enjoy it in a measure, also other families.<a name=83:19></a> But although all share it, the Lord's presence is vouchsafed now to the very smallest companies of His own, who seek and are prepared for it in as real and blessed a manner as it was known in the church at the beginning.<a name=83:20></a> Note the Lord's words even as to an individual.<a name=83:21></a> "We (the Father and He) will <i>come</i> unto him and make our abode with him".<a name=83:22></a> I fully recognise with Mr.<a name=83:23></a> Higgins the danger of arrogating to ourselves what belongs only to the assembly as a whole, but we do ourselves great wrong if we allow this danger to deprive us of the privileges which the Lord has graciously promised to His own for a day such as ours.<a name=83:24></a> The more we enjoy them the less exposed we are to the threatened danger.<a name=83:25></a> In Laodicea the Lord was ready to go in to any one that would open to

		Him.<a name=84:1></a> This shows that there is <i>movement on His part</i> in response to movement on our side.<a name=84:2></a> As far as I understand Mr.<a name=84:3></a> Higgins there is no movement on the Lord's side; He has taken up a position in the midst, and we move to Him; now, we do move to His side -- that shows <i>our</i> love; but then He moves <i>to us</i>, and this evidences His love.<a name=84:4></a> I am greatly interested in what you said as to the Song of Solomon.<a name=84:5></a> I love the thought of the Lord <i>coming</i> -- His is active love, not <i>stationary</i> love.<a name=84:6></a> I believe this is behind His word <i>coming</i> in every connection.<a name=84:7></a>

		My Dear Brother, -- I am glad to have yours of October 8th.<a name=84:11></a> I think with you that <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:10">Hebrews  2:10</a> - 12 is an advance on <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:19">Hebrews  10:19</a> - 22.<a name=84:12></a> The tabernacle was really for the wilderness, it did not suggest a place of enjoyment.<a name=84:13></a> The holiest represents what we apprehend (by the Spirit, of course) with the <i>mind</i> rather than what we enjoy in the affections, which flow from relationship.<a name=84:14></a> <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:10">Hebrews  2:10</a> - 12 involved the latter only.<a name=84:15></a> Christ's side is in view rather than ours.<a name=84:16></a> Hebrews 2 and <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>are, of course, on resurrection ground, but they go beyond this.<a name=84:17></a> Resurrection refers to <i>God's</i> power, His victory.<a name=84:18></a> It is the ground (righteousness accomplished) upon which God establishes the whole system which He purposes.<a name=84:19></a> There are many degrees of privilege in this system; the church has the greatest.<a name=84:20></a> We must be on our guard that we do not limit our privilege simply by resurrection ground.<a name=84:21></a> <i>Angels</i> announced the resurrection in the gospels, but the <i>Lord</i> announced our privileges, <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>.<a name=84:22></a> These consist of relationship and position.<a name=84:23></a> We are sons of God, brethren of Christ, and our place is heaven.<a name=84:24></a>

		As to the wilderness, I apprehend it (1) to set forth the progress of the believer from Egypt to Canaan.<a name=84:25></a> I connect Marah, <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21">Numbers  21</a>, Jordan, etc.<a name=84:26></a>, with this, rather than the assembly as such.<a name=84:27></a> Then (2) I look upon the wilderness as the sphere in which God's testimony is set forth, that is, the world where Christ died.<a name=84:28></a> Vitally the assembly is formed in Canaan, but those formed are also viewed as in flesh and blood, and they

		form God's assembly in the world.<a name=85:1></a> With this position the Supper stands connected, as Scripture presents it.<a name=85:2></a> We know Christ is out of death, and by faith we are out of it; but we are actually in a state (flesh and blood) to which resurrection does not refer, and we are actually in a scene to which resurrection does not refer; the scene of Christ's death and His absence now.<a name=85:3></a> There we remember Him; we remember Him as absent, but by a symbol which speaks of His death.<a name=85:4></a> To make my meaning clear, I would say again that when I say the Supper is celebrated in the wilderness, I mean that it is celebrated in the world viewed as the scene out of which Christ has gone .<a name=85:5></a>.<a name=85:6></a>.<a name=85:7></a> where He is absent and where His rejection and death occurred, and that we celebrate it in the condition in which the Lord left us here (flesh and blood) and that it refers to us only in this condition.<a name=85:8></a> It is "till He come", when this condition will cease.<a name=85:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Our assembly privileges lie outside this condition, and to touch them now we have to pass over to Christ's side; but this involves spiritual power.<a name=85:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to <a href="../bible/John.htm#6">John  6</a>, the point is to apprehend the Lord <i>coming down</i> so as to be food for all; but He dies, and the flesh is truly food, and His blood truly drink.<a name=85:11></a> "He that eats .<a name=85:12></a>.<a name=85:13></a>.<a name=85:14></a> has eternal life;" it is individual.<a name=85:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Supper refers to Christ's love for us and ours for Him, but the more one is in <a href="../bible/John.htm#6">John  6</a>, the more will he respond to the Supper.<a name=85:16></a> I hope my meaning is clear to you.<a name=85:17></a>

		During my visit to your side of the water, nothing has impressed me more than the great need at the present time of keeping to the way Scripture presents the truth, and of allowing it to have its full force and authority in the way in which it may set forth any subject.<a name=85:31></a> Therefore, as the Supper is not introduced in an epistle which views the saints as risen with Christ, I hesitate to accept that it is on this ground; on the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=86>[Page 86]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		other hand, I am thankful to know that I can at <i>all</i> times account of myself as risen with Christ -- for it is a matter of <i>faith</i>, not actual.<a name=86:1></a> But I find that risen with Christ is connected in Scripture (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2">Colossians  2</a>) with a spiritual state -- "quickened together" -- indeed it is only in the power of the latter that the former is of <i>practical</i> value.<a name=86:2></a> I think there is perfect wisdom in the way the truth is presented.<a name=86:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Your remark, 'There can, I think, be no doubt that it is on resurrection ground that one truly apprehends the Supper', I agree with, only I would connect the power of apprehension with a spiritual state rather than with a ground which faith takes.<a name=86:4></a> But then our apprehension is not the point, but rather, In what position does Scripture regard us when breaking bread?<a name=86:5></a> First, we are where Christ is not, for the Supper is, "till He comes;" it is during His absence, for it is a remembrance; the place of Christ's absence is not Canaan.<a name=86:6></a> Secondly, we are in a flesh and blood condition, and our eating the bread and drinking the cup is before the world and a testimony to it of our complete identification with the Christ it crucified -- ye do show the Lord's death till He come.<a name=86:7></a> Thirdly, the Supper is celebrated in the assembly viewed as recognised in <i>this world</i>, not as a new creation in Christ, in which latter view it is beyond the ken of the world.<a name=86:8></a> It is celebrated in the assembly as marked off from Jew and Gentile.<a name=86:9></a> There was the Jew, the Gentile, and the church of God.<a name=86:10></a> In other words, it is in the assembly as under man's eye, where divine order (involving the relative place of man and woman) is seen, and where all are publicly committed to the death of Christ.<a name=86:11></a> What may go on in our souls is another matter, and our spiritual states will vary, but Scripture contemplates all as partaking of the Supper.<a name=86:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would not undervalue for a moment the spiritual state by which we are enabled to appreciate the Supper; this the Lord takes account of, and it will involve power to pass over to His side as He is brought to our minds by the breaking of bread.<a name=86:13></a> The latter (passing to His side) is entirely a spiritual action and is outside of the world and nature altogether.<a name=86:14></a> It belongs to Canaan.<a name=86:15></a> The Supper is the introduction to it.<a name=86:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards the breaking of bread, it is quite clear to me that this is distinct from the <i>communion;</i> that is, the former is what <i>Christ did</i>, and we are to do it also.<a name=86:17></a> "The Lord Jesus .<a name=86:18></a>.<a name=86:19></a>.<a name=86:20></a> took bread, and having given thanks, broke it and said .<a name=86:21></a>.<a name=86:22></a>.<a name=86:23></a> <i>this do</i>".<a name=86:24></a> Hence, "the bread which we break".<a name=86:25></a> Nothing can be plainer

		than this, it seems to me.<a name=87:1></a> Our partaking or eating is another thought -- this is communion.<a name=87:2></a> In other words, <i>breaking</i> bread is one thing, and <i>eating</i> another, both necessary to the Supper.<a name=87:3></a> J.<a name=87:4></a>N.<a name=87:5></a>D.<a name=87:6></a>'s remarks I do not well understand, but I judge he is dwelling on the communion side, evidently showing that this is distinct from the breaking of the loaf.<a name=87:7></a> But he does say the latter is 'absolutely necessary as a figure'.<a name=87:8></a> But we have to go by the Lord's words -- <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22:19">Luke  22:19</a>; <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:24">1 Corinthians  11:24</a>.<a name=87:9></a>

		in chapter 6, where it is treated as in chapter 15) and there Christ only is said to be risen -- the saints' resurrection is future.<a name=90:1></a> The saints at Corinth were the assembly of God <i>there</i> -- they were a company of men and women in that city that had been separated from the world by the testimony of the gospel.<a name=90:2></a> They were marked off <i>there</i> as God's assembly.<a name=90:3></a> Whereas, as risen with Christ we are in an out-of-the-world order of things.<a name=90:4></a> As risen with Christ we are over Jordan clearly -- qualified to be His companions.<a name=90:5></a> As to the temple in Corinthians, I do not think it is alluded to as a fixed abode in contrast to the tabernacle but rather that it was "holy".<a name=90:6></a> This they were by the death of Christ and as possessing the Holy Spirit.<a name=90:7></a> The <i>tabernacle</i> was in principle what they were (compare <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#6:16">2 Corinthians  6:16</a> where the temple is connected with God <i>walking</i>, also <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#26:12">Leviticus  26:12</a> and <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#29:45">Exodus  29:45</a>).<a name=90:8></a> The <i>body</i> of the believer is a temple of the Holy Spirit, and <i>it</i> is not viewed as raised.<a name=90:9></a> The same remarks apply equally, in measure, to the "body" as viewed in 1 Corinthians.<a name=90:10></a> The Corinthian saints were Christ's body as having the Spirit.<a name=90:11></a> Corinthians treats the body as it is <i>now</i> -- not exactly in relation to divine purpose -- this latter is Ephesians.<a name=90:12></a> But it is clear that they are regarded in this respect as in their flesh and blood condition -- their <i>bodies</i> were members of Christ.<a name=90:13></a> God had raised up the Lord and will raise us up "from among the dead by His power", chapter 6.<a name=90:14></a> This does not show that they were viewed on resurrection ground (compare <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:4">Acts  9:4</a>, 5; <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#12:1">Acts  12:1</a>, 2).<a name=90:15></a> As to the Supper being out of the view of the world -- that the doors were shut according to the gospel history, and that you know of nothing in Corinthians to change this, I would say that chapter 14: 24 is a proof that there was a change.<a name=90:16></a> I think too, that <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:42">Acts  2:42</a> - 47 shows that things were more or less public.<a name=90:17></a> You say the testimony seen in the 'sacraments is for God, and not for the world'.<a name=90:18></a> I am entirely at a loss to know how our eating the Supper is an announcement <i>to God</i> that Christ died, or that baptism is not a testimony to the world that Christ's claim over the believer is recognised by him.<a name=90:19></a> As to the act of breaking bread I have hardly anything to add to what I said in my previous letters.<a name=90:20></a> I have been unable to look up J.<a name=90:21></a>N.<a name=90:22></a>D.<a name=90:23></a>'s paper to which you refer.<a name=90:24></a> It is likely that he was dealing with materialism -- that the element is changed by the action of the priest.<a name=90:25></a> At any rate, he says that the breaking of the bread is 'absolutely necessary as a figure'.<a name=90:26></a> However, as I said in my last, we have

		<i>A Statement of Facts relating to the recent Case of Discipline in New York</i>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As we have heard that some brethren at a distance have been disturbed by the reports which are being circulated of the case of discipline which we have thought necessary to exercise in this city of late, it seems to us that a brief statement of the facts may be of service.<a name=91:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		the meeting at Brooklyn, which began by a contentious spirit shown in the readings on the part of certain brothers.<a name=92:1></a> Early in last year it became so serious that the brethren felt something should be done to modify or stop it entirely.<a name=92:2></a> On certain occasions painful scenes occurred.<a name=92:3></a> Brethren came together and it was found that three brothers were almost entirely responsible for this, and they were admonished by all to avoid participating in the meetings in a contentious or controversial way.<a name=92:4></a> In a short time, however, they reverted to their old ways, and again sorrowful scenes ensued.<a name=92:5></a> The brethren again came together, and these brothers were admonished a second time to desist.<a name=92:6></a> At the second meeting a question arose as to what could be done further if these brothers persisted in a course which was throwing the saints into confusion, and it was pointed out that in the event of this a severer discipline would have to be inflicted.<a name=92:7></a> About this time one of the brothers left the city permanently, and he expressed great regret for the part he had taken in the meetings.<a name=92:8></a> One of the other brothers also expressed sorrow for his part, and did not subsequently participate in the meetings in any contentious spirit.<a name=92:9></a> The third brother, Mr.<a name=92:10></a> F.<a name=92:11></a> Murphy, was very refractory and remained away from the meetings for some six weeks; and when the brethren visited him he alleged that they were governed by clerical principles, and that it was wrong to admonish him: that those who did so were governed by a partisan spirit.<a name=92:12></a> The brethren however, hoped for the best, so allowed him to come back and break bread; but we feel now that fellowship should have been refused him then until he had judged his ways.<a name=92:13></a> The brethren, however, treated him as one under discipline, but this he resented throughout, and took every opportunity to disregard our consciences.<a name=92:14></a> He waxed so bold in this that a third meeting had to be called.<a name=92:15></a> This meeting resulted in a meagre admission by Mr.<a name=92:16></a> Murphy that he had been wrong, and he expressed some sorrow for offending the brethren.<a name=92:17></a> We were most grateful for this, as can be understood, as we had hoped that God had been working with him leading to repentance.<a name=92:18></a> It soon appeared, however, that this was not so, as he again began to assume a contentious attitude in the meetings, and the brethren generally in the three meetings were forced to the conclusion that if he continued we should have to refuse to walk with him so as to maintain the order and holiness due to God's house.<a name=92:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=93>[Page 93]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It may be said here that during all these sorrowful experiences Mr.<a name=93:1></a> Murphy was directly and indirectly supported by quite a few in the meeting (although there was general agreement to the admonitions); were it not for this, as can be understood he would not have continued such a course.<a name=93:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the month of July two readings were greatly disturbed, and at the close of the second it was laid upon some of us that the brethren should be asked to meet again to face the difficulty.<a name=93:3></a> All agreed to the meeting, which was held at the close of that week.<a name=93:4></a> The three meetings were well represented on this occasion, and there was a full discussion of all the facts referring to the matter.<a name=93:5></a> It was clear that most present had judged Mr.<a name=93:6></a> Murphy's course to be lawless and so we thought well to ask all the saints (brothers and sisters) to come together and lay the matter before them in an orderly way.<a name=93:7></a> The ground of our judgment that Mr.<a name=93:8></a> Murphy was a lawless man was, that he had pursued a course in the meetings which caused disorder and threw the saints into confusion, and that he had refused to listen to the admonitions of the brethren to desist from this course.<a name=93:9></a> Besides, he had gathered a party around him.<a name=93:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When all the saints were gathered on the appointed evening, the history of the case was related to them, certain brethren stating their individual exercises and giving their reasons for refusing to longer walk with Mr.<a name=93:11></a> Murphy.<a name=93:12></a> Mr.<a name=93:13></a> Murphy gave a long address in his own defence, and one of his supporters read some papers objecting to what the brethren felt they were forced to resort to.<a name=93:14></a> Mr.<a name=93:15></a> Murphy also stated he would be present on the following Lord's day to break bread, those who judged his course to be evil could not go there as this would involve confusion, and God is not the author of confusion but of peace.<a name=93:16></a> Consequently we broke bread elsewhere, and Mr.<a name=93:17></a> Murphy and his supporters met in the room and continued to meet there for some weeks.<a name=93:18></a> The room has since been given up by them, and we meet there at present as usual.<a name=93:19></a> It was found that the other two meetings in the city with two-thirds of the meeting of Brooklyn were unanimous in their refusal to walk with Mr.<a name=93:20></a> Murphy in Christian fellowship.<a name=93:21></a> We might add that the meetings in the district are in sympathy with us in what we have done, and, as far as we know, all the meetings in the States and Canada, who know of the difficulty, accept our action as right.<a name=93:22></a>

		Beloved Brother, -- Miss Elwood mentioned that you had made enquiry as to my view of <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:12">Hebrews  2:12</a>, and I think it well to send a line.<a name=95:10></a> It seems to me that to arrive at the truth we ought to seek to determine what the Lord had in His mind when He uttered these words.<a name=95:11></a> Did He take account of the assembly only in the light of God's purpose or did He also include in His mind her wilderness circumstances?<a name=95:12></a> My conviction is that the latter was not in the Lord's thought: that He contemplated the saints as gathered around Him, consequent on His death and resurrection, and so viewed outside of wilderness conditions.<a name=95:13></a> To apprehend the thing in a concrete way I think we have to go back to <i>original</i> conditions -- we have to do this indeed to rightly understand any church truth.<a name=95:14></a> And I would say that when the saints came together in assembly, the Lord came to them and this was realised.<a name=95:15></a> The Spirit does not record or give examples of the <i>inward</i> working of the assembly, viewed in this exalted position, after Pentecost.<a name=95:16></a> I think it is left to intelligent affection to find out.<a name=95:17></a> The scene after the Supper, when they sang a hymn, is the closest analogy, as to singing, but this was <i>before</i> death and resurrection.<a name=95:18></a> They were then on Jewish ground, afterwards the disciples would be regarded as His brethren before the Father -- now made known.<a name=95:19></a> But as to <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>, it is well to remember that it is not the unfolding of church truth, but to show the humanity of our Lord; therefore it is not a question of <i>when</i> He sings, but that He sings in the midst of the church.<a name=95:20></a> It is a characteristic function, as also the declaring of the Father's name to His brethren.<a name=95:21></a> It seems clear that the primary thought of the church is that those who form it should be together and its distinctive privileges are thus enjoyed.<a name=95:22></a> This shall be true eternally -- "caught up <i>together</i>".<a name=95:23></a> Much may be said of the wilderness, as involving God's ways, but it is incidental.<a name=95:24></a> But our wilderness position cannot be ignored, and I am sure it is not right to apply to us <i>in it</i> what Scripture connects with us only as viewed in the land.<a name=95:25></a>

		Dear Brother, -- -I am in receipt of your letter of October 19th, and I am glad to send a line in reply.<a name=96:4></a> As to the wilderness, there are two ways as I understand, in which it has to be taken account of.<a name=96:5></a> First, it is the sphere in which the believer carries out the will of God and where he learns what is in his own heart, etc.<a name=96:6></a>, and it sets forth the progress he makes from Egypt to Canaan.<a name=96:7></a> Secondly, the wilderness is the scene in which God's testimony (as the tabernacle represents it) is set forth.<a name=96:8></a> This is seen in the book of Numbers; in the antitype this involves the saints collectively and 1 Corinthians corresponds.<a name=96:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In this epistle the saints are viewed as God's assembly in Corinth -- not in heavenly places, or as risen with Christ but as called out of the world morally but actually still in it.<a name=96:10></a> It is God's assembly as distinct from Jew and Gentile.<a name=96:11></a> The Supper stands in this relation and hence I understand it is celebrated in the wilderness.<a name=96:12></a> The Supper is a remembrance and hence has no force where Christ is -- it refers to His absence.<a name=96:13></a> Normally the saints came together to break bread because they loved Christ.<a name=96:14></a> They felt His absence and the Supper reminded them of Him.<a name=96:15></a> If He is present we do not need a symbol to remind us of Him.<a name=96:16></a> He is made known in the breaking of bread.<a name=96:17></a>

		Beloved Brother, -- I am very glad to find that we are not far apart as to the subject in question -- <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:12">Hebrews  2:12</a>.<a name=97:21></a> I do not object to anything you say, only with yourself I think your view may be a bit too general.<a name=97:22></a> I doubt, however, that I can say anything to make the matter any clearer.<a name=97:23></a> But it is well to enquire fully, and we may be sure that when Christ only and the truth are before us, we shall get help.<a name=97:24></a> My conviction is that the Lord in using these precious words did not contemplate the saints as in their wilderness, or incidental, circumstances, but rather as a company -- the glorious result of His death.<a name=97:25></a> Were we to take the assembly as viewed only in the light of this passage we would think of it in no other circumstances than as

		My Dear Brother, -- I am very glad to have another letter from you, and especially for your remarks on the Supper, etc.<a name=98:17></a> In my last letter, my effort was to show that the passage of the Jordan, as a type, is connected with the experimental side; as to the people, it follows the brazen serpent and springing well; it involves, therefore, a spiritual state.<a name=98:18></a> It is true that 'in the mind of God' (for He can call things that be not, as though they were), all are over; but then the Scripture views us <i>also</i> in the wilderness; we have to be careful to note how Scripture presents the truth.<a name=98:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, where the antitype to the passage of the Jordan, and Canaan appears in the New Testament (as Colossians and Ephesians), it will be found that a spiritual state, or formation, in the saints is also introduced.<a name=98:20></a> On the other hand, epistles (such as Romans and 1 Corinthians), which view the saints in the wilderness, do not speak of their being quickened as a present fact.<a name=98:21></a> The truth is that baptism, rightly accepted, places one in the wilderness, but it does not place him in Canaan, it is by the power of the Spirit that he enters Canaan, although on the ground (objectively) of Christ having gone through Jordan before him.<a name=98:22></a> What I see, therefore, is that all who have accepted baptism, having the Spirit, are qualified for the Supper,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=99>[Page 99]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and may enjoy it in measure, although each may not have spiritual power to pass over to the Canaan side.<a name=99:1></a> <i>Some</i> may have this power and so enter into the truth and reality of the assembly viewed as a new creation.<a name=99:2></a> As to what we may be in the mind of God, this applies at <i>all</i> times as a matter of <i>light</i>, as well as when we are gathered together: that is, we can always revert to what we are in God's counsels.<a name=99:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then the Scriptures contemplate us <i>also</i>, as we are actually down here, <i>and it is in this connection the Lord's supper is found</i>.<a name=99:4></a> But viewed in God's counsels, we are outside this state, hence, "if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:17">2 Corinthians  5:17</a>).<a name=99:5></a> If there is power for it, I believe that after the breaking of bread is the opportune time for entering into this; hence, I spoke of the assembly as a new creation, as properly connected with the latter part of the meeting for the breaking of bread.<a name=99:6></a> I note your remark 'I should have said that there is the distinction between male and female throughout, both before and after the breaking of bread'.<a name=99:7></a> But this would mean that we <i>never</i> rise to new creation collectively.<a name=99:8></a> In Christ Jesus, there is neither male nor female.<a name=99:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When I say that "over Jordan" is on the experimental side, I do not mean that there is not a corresponding objective side, for there is; this is in the fact that Christ is over.<a name=99:10></a> <i>Title</i> to Canaan is for all, but entrance into it is by the <i>Spirit;</i> hence, as I said, it is found in Scripture side by side with a spiritual state in the saints.<a name=99:11></a> But to treat as Canaan what Scripture regards as the wilderness is confusion, and but reduces the character of the blessing involved in the former.<a name=99:12></a> And this is an end the enemy would like to reach.<a name=99:13></a> Canaan represents, typically, our highest privileges; there we feed on Christ, as the old corn, the ascended, heavenly Man.<a name=99:14></a> It is not the manna, or <a href="../bible/John.htm#6">John  6</a>; these refer to Christ coming <i>down;</i> the old corn is Christ having gone up.<a name=99:15></a> We do not enjoy this, as brothers or sisters; but as risen with Christ, and heavenly.<a name=99:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is true that we may not rise from the level of male and female after the breaking of bread, but we are <i>entitled to;</i> but to do so <i>before</i> would be confusion, because the ordinance contemplates us <i>in a flesh and blood condition</i>.<a name=99:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the holiest, the reference to it in the New Testament alludes to the wilderness position, the tabernacle.<a name=99:18></a> But it is a thought <i>beyond</i> the Supper; the latter suggests the <i>way</i> into it.<a name=99:19></a>

		It is true that as the sons of Aaron, our place is within, with Christ but this is not the ground we are on at the Supper.<a name=100:1></a> The Supper is the death of Christ, and this took place (typically) in the <i>court</i> of the tabernacle, actually outside the gate.<a name=100:2></a> It was public, and we are identified with it.<a name=100:3></a> But our place is inside with the Father, and we go in, as it were, through the Supper.<a name=100:4></a> The way is paved with the love of Christ.<a name=100:5></a>

		As to your remark: 'All who have the Spirit are in Christ, etc.<a name=100:6></a>', I would say that this is true from the divine side, as you say, but I think we do well to bear in mind that "in Christ" in Scripture, is made to involve new creation.<a name=100:7></a> The truth of the body is involved in the Supper, but clearly, it is practical unity, as seen on earth, that is in view, and not the body viewed in God's counsels, as in Ephesians.<a name=100:8></a> In Corinthians, we are viewed as here in the flesh; hence "if one member <i>suffer</i>".<a name=100:9></a> I refer to this, as an important distinction; the truth of the body applies to us as we are in the world, as well as applying to us, viewed as in Christ, in God's world.<a name=100:10></a>

		to the then state of the saints, and hence, as you say, full justice will be done to the side of the truth that may be considered necessary to press.<a name=105:1></a> Thus, while statements contained in such ministry have their own weight, they cannot be considered as <i>final</i>.<a name=105:2></a> As to Colossians, that resurrection ground viewed by itself, is not heavenly ground is as certain as anything can be.<a name=105:3></a> I remember hearing of F.<a name=105:4></a>E.<a name=105:5></a>R.<a name=105:6></a> <i>whistling</i> in ridicule when told that a brother said at a reading on Colossians that resurrection took us to heaven.<a name=105:7></a> We all know how he used to speak of eternal life not going beyond the earth, and how he connected it with the Christian circle.<a name=105:8></a> He distinguished the heavenly position from this, but we have to rely on Scripture and Colossians does not treat of a company viewed in heavenly places, nor of a heavenly people on earth; but a risen people, who are exhorted to set their minds on things above <i>where Christ is</i> .<a name=105:9></a>.<a name=105:10></a>.<a name=105:11></a> heaven is set before them, not yet accepted as to position.<a name=105:12></a> I believe the Lord is helping as to these things, especially on your side.<a name=105:13></a> I believe brethren generally are recognising the importance of insisting on the heavenly position, while clinging to resurrection as the victory of God over Satan and death.<a name=105:14></a> Too much can scarcely be made of resurrection and I am thankful it is so prominent.<a name=105:15></a> As to <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>, I have never taken the Lord's act of breathing into His disciples as anything more than signifying that they should partake of His life, that this took place actually at Pentecost.<a name=105:16></a> But breathing into them is a much more <i>endearing</i> transaction, and more intimate, than sending the Holy Spirit from heaven.<a name=105:17></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>is pattern, as we have often heard, the Lord's ascension is assumed, otherwise He would not take the ground of giving the Holy Spirit (<a href="../bible/John.htm#7">John  7</a>), but then really He had not ascended, and so the Holy Spirit was not given.<a name=105:18></a> All is pattern and was made good historically at Pentecost.<a name=105:19></a> But when the Holy Spirit did come the disciples would know that as well as having a personal Comforter, they had the very Spirit and life of Christ.<a name=105:20></a> This they would understand from the Lord's action in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>.<a name=105:21></a>

		My Dear Brother, -- You must pardon my long delay in answering yours of May 11th.<a name=109:13></a> I would have written from the steamer, but I did not feel so much up to writing as usual, and I had a great deal of urgent matters to attend to, and you kindly intimated that your letter was <i>not</i> urgent.<a name=109:14></a> On arrival here there were special meetings on, and this took up a great deal of my time.<a name=109:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now as to the Lord's presence at the breaking of bread, I think I fully understand your difficulty.<a name=109:16></a> Let me say at the outset that I quite accept that the Lord is with His people (assuming that they are seeking to follow righteousness) at all times when they are together, especially for support and protection.<a name=109:17></a> I always feel like nestling under the wing of His protection when gathered with His people.<a name=109:18></a> This involves the care which His love prompts, and which His power affords.<a name=109:19></a> <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18">Matthew  18</a>is on this line, especially as to support.<a name=109:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But however blessed all this is, it is not <i>full</i> assembly privilege.<a name=109:21></a> This involves that the Lord comes to us as Head, and leads us into the consciousness of our relation with Him before the Father.<a name=109:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am sure a moment's reflection will enable any thoughtful person to see that this is altogether to be distinguished from the Lord's presence in the way of authority and protective and sustaining power in connection with our wilderness circumstances.<a name=109:23></a> I wish I knew more of the distinction myself, and my constant prayer is that the saints may be exercised as to the full privilege of the assembly that we may know what it is to be for Christ and so to be <i>with</i> Him outside of what we are in flesh and blood.<a name=109:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I cannot see why it is not seen to be quite inconsistent and indeed confusing to identify this with the actual breaking of bread, for the latter is a remembrance whereas the former is the presence of the One we love.<a name=109:25></a> I believe a good deal of the

	<div class="paragraph">
		As to whether we remember the Lord as He <i>is</i> or as He <i>was</i> -- my understanding is that we remember <i>Him</i> -- the Person who is absent.<a name=110:2></a> The Lord did not ask the disciples to remember Him <i>as He was</i>.<a name=110:3></a> He said, "This do for remembrance of me".<a name=110:4></a> I always think of christendom as guilty of forgetfulness of Christ.<a name=110:5></a>

		My Dear Brother, -- What you refer to as to the city and eternal life has been on my mind also.<a name=110:9></a> One thing I see is that a primary <i>may</i> become relative, and so serve God's purpose in <i>time</i> in meeting the result of sin.<a name=110:10></a> Eternal life comes in in that way.<a name=110:11></a> It appears in contrast to death, but at the same time it was the condition in which God purposed man to be before Him eternally.<a name=110:12></a> So it abides essentially.<a name=110:13></a> Then as to the city, while in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21">Revelation  21</a>it is spoke in connection with the eternal state of things the <i>tabernacle</i> idea takes its place.<a name=110:14></a> "The tabernacle of God is with men" was what <i>heaven</i> understood.<a name=110:15></a>

		As to the application of Old Testament types, I think we have to carefully compare New Testament light as to the subject that may be in question.<a name=113:30></a> The first epistle to the Corinthians is, so to speak, the law of the house.<a name=113:31></a> There 'the flesh had worked' and 'was working', and yet the apostle does not intimate that anyone going there would be defiled.<a name=113:32></a> Of course, if the evil were not judged, <i>all</i> would be defiled, but the epistle shows that there may be evil in a meeting, and yet all not be regarded as defiled.<a name=113:33></a> Many in the meeting may have judged it, but through weakness have not been able to deal with it

		God owns this, and they are morally clean, or clear on the matter.<a name=114:3></a> The epistle says that there must needs be divisions (or sects) that the "approved may be made manifest among you".<a name=114:4></a> The <i>approved</i> are not unclean, surely.<a name=114:5></a> God would make them manifest through divisions, and it is for the saints to recognise this.<a name=114:6></a>

		In the type you refer to (<a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#14">Leviticus  14</a>) it is said that <i>God would put</i> leprosy in a house; but in 'shutting up a meeting', as we speak, we do not assume that leprosy is there; the Spirit of Christ would lead us to hope for the best, and it is not just to assume that evil exists until the proof of it is established.<a name=114:7></a> Grace would assume the contrary, and certainly, if there are those in the locality whom God approved, <i>they</i> are not leprous.<a name=114:8></a> Therefore I do not see that brethren elsewhere should ask saints in a locality to cease breaking bread unless <i>known evil</i> is there, except as a <i>precautionary</i> measure.<a name=114:9></a> It must be, to some extent, a matter of mutual agreement, resorted to in <i>wisdom;</i> for Scripture does not warrant the refusal of fellowship to saints, unless they are committed to evil.<a name=114:10></a>

		My Dear Brother, -- I am glad to have your letter of May 30th, which came two days ago.<a name=120:23></a> In view of your explanations I believe further correspondence may be of mutual help.<a name=120:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As said in my previous letters, my objection has been to the published statement on page 316 of December <i>Mutual Comfort</i>, and I regret to have to say that my difficulty still remains, notwithstanding that you have altered it.<a name=120:25></a> The altered statement reads: 'If the church (having been set up in the position of a responsible witness on earth) had not failed it <i>could</i> not have been translated (for its translation would have been <i>inconsistent with the ways of God</i>, as seen in Adam, Noah, Israel, the priesthood, David's house, and Nebuchadnezzar)'.<a name=120:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=121>[Page 121]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In spite of the modifying parenthesis, I have to say that the statement is not the truth.<a name=121:1></a> 'Could not have been translated' cannot be supported by Scripture, I am confident: indeed it is contrary to the plain teaching of the Word, as I have said in former letters.<a name=121:2></a> The fact that it was made in other connections is no justification for a statement that is contrary to any given scripture or scriptures, as this is to <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>and <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#4">1 Thessalonians  4</a>.<a name=121:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I know you hold to John 14 and 1 Thessalonians 4, hence I am free to speak plainly as to your <i>words</i>, which are contrary to these scriptures.<a name=121:4></a> Indeed you strongly disclaim any thought of connecting your statement with these scriptures.<a name=121:5></a> I quote from your letter: 'The sentence in question you say is contrary to John 14 and 1 Thessalonians 4.<a name=121:6></a> I agree if it had been so used'.<a name=121:7></a> Here the question arises as to whether any scriptural subject can be dealt with unless the passages that deal with it are allowed to speak.<a name=121:8></a> If so, the establishment of error is an easy matter.<a name=121:9></a> Whatever the context of a scripture it is well to remember the Lord's words, "the scripture cannot be broken".<a name=121:10></a> On the other hand it is true that if contexts are ignored the Scriptures themselves at times seem contradictory, but where is the scripture that says, or even seems to say that the church, as set up in responsibility, could not be translated had it not failed?<a name=121:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In all I have said your contention that the church's position of responsibility on earth is not found in the scriptures mentioned has been assumed.<a name=121:12></a> But as far as I understand John 14, the assembly's responsibility on earth during the Lord's absence is very distinctly taught there.<a name=121:13></a> Indeed that whole section of the gospel (chapters 13 to 17) has in view the preparation of the saints for this very thing.<a name=121:14></a> Judas' betrayal and Peter's denial of the Lord undoubtedly point to certain church history -- history found in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2">Revelation  2</a>.<a name=121:15></a> Such would cause a troubled heart.<a name=121:16></a> The Lord would assure His own and establish them in confidence in Himself "Believe also on me" implies responsibility.<a name=121:17></a> This is confirmed in verse 12, for the Lord says further, "He that believes on me the works that I do shall he do", and so elsewhere in the chapter.<a name=121:18></a> It is in this connection we have, "I am coming again and shall receive you unto myself".<a name=121:19></a> Then as to 1 Thessalonians, it would be hard to show that the church's responsibility in some measure is not found there, and even in the very context in which the 'rapture' appears.<a name=121:20></a>

		As to the church's tenure of witness-bearing on earth, this would necessarily end at the coming of the Lord.<a name=122:1></a> There is no thought of the church continuing indefinitely -- "till I come" was to be the limit.<a name=122:2></a> The Lord's coming was not contingent on the church's failure.<a name=122:3></a> Besides her position was essentially different from those who witnessed before her (Adam, Noah, Israel, etc.<a name=122:4></a>); they were indigenous to their environment; she is an exotic.<a name=122:5></a> She belongs to heaven and must go to heaven.<a name=122:6></a> It is true that the Lord's coming is a necessity now on account of the church's failure, but this does not set aside His primary announced thought of coming for her and she reigning with Him.<a name=122:7></a>

		I have written pointing out that the standard set up by them is pure law, and that all Christian responsibility is under grace -- that we are judged by "the law of liberty".<a name=122:41></a> Their standard is a yoke of bondage.<a name=122:42></a>

		<a name=123>[Page 123]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I think this controversy will do good.<a name=123:1></a> I have felt for a long time that saints have been so habituated to connect the thought of responsibility with law and with man in the flesh, that it is difficult for them to entertain the thought of a new character of responsibility as under grace and a man renewed in mind so that he answers to it.<a name=123:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I just mention this to show what is working.<a name=123:8></a> I have written to J.<a name=123:9></a> Henderson very plainly as to the elementary features of Christian responsibility, and I am awaiting with confidence (not altogether unmixed with anxiety) his reply.<a name=123:10></a>

		I think it will be well for you to see J.<a name=123:11></a> S.<a name=123:12></a> Giles <i>alone</i> if possible.<a name=123:13></a> I do not believe he really holds what is conveyed and involved in his statements.<a name=123:14></a> But in his anxiety to maintain the statement in December <i>Mutual Comfort</i>, he is saying things more grave, and apparently without being conscious of it.<a name=123:15></a>

		First, as regards the word 'faithfulness', what I commented on as far as I remember (I have not a copy of my letter) was the respective meanings of the <i>English words</i> 'faithfulness' and 'responsibility' -- neither of which is found in the New Testament -- the former not in Scripture.<a name=126:7></a> You will therefore see, that your remarks as to the Greek word translated faithful are beside the mark.<a name=126:8></a> As to the English word 'faithful' the ordinary meaning is that one is trustworthy and true in the fulfilment of duty.<a name=126:9></a> In this I say again that faithfulness is seen in the carrying out of a given responsibility.<a name=126:10></a> The word has minor meanings, it is true, but the above is the <i>general</i> one.<a name=126:11></a> Hence in view of the ordinary meaning of the English words it is quite wrong to deny that faithfulness is the measure in which duty, or obligation, is fulfilled.<a name=126:12></a> I agree that the word translated 'faithful' is from the word translated 'faith', and that it sometimes means that one has faith, etc.<a name=126:13></a>; but I cannot agree that it is the <i>general</i> meaning of the word in the Scriptures.<a name=126:14></a> It is generally used according to the ordinary meaning of the word 'faithful' in English.<a name=126:15></a> It is so used of God, Christ and the saints.<a name=126:16></a>

		On page 3 you say: 'You quote Moses being spoken of as faithful as though it could only be said of him and a few others'.<a name=126:17></a> I have no recollection of limiting faithfulness to Moses and a few others, and I have no such thought; for I know that whole

		companies of saints are addressed as "faithful in Christ".<a name=127:1></a> I spoke of Moses' faithfulness as set down alongside that of the Lord Jesus -- "as also Moses".<a name=127:2></a> This is worthy of note.<a name=127:3></a> God honours His servant in this reference to Him, but your remarks cast a shadow on this; they also ignore that some are called faithful in the New Testament because they are specially marked by fidelity to Christ and the truth.<a name=127:4></a> "Faithful men" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2">2 Timothy  2</a>) means something more than that all saints may be regarded as faithful.<a name=127:5></a>

		On this same page you quote from a letter of mine: 'The church did fulfil its responsibility at the beginning', and then proceed to say, 'The first word that the Spirit has to say to the church set up in responsibility is: "Thou art fallen"'.<a name=127:6></a> The first word spoken <i>of</i> the church according to Scripture contains this commendatory tribute: "They continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:42">Acts  2:42</a>), also the remaining verse of the chapter.<a name=127:7></a> This is a very different word from "Thou art fallen".<a name=127:8></a> It is simply futile to say this was not the church in responsibility; it <i>was</i> the church in responsibility.<a name=127:9></a> The Spirit records these things of the saints.<a name=127:10></a> They were responsible to continue in the apostles' doctrine, for instance, and they did.<a name=127:11></a> They were so according to the mind of God in their ways that the Lord added such as should be saved to them -- the assembly.<a name=127:12></a> What you say as to God demonstrating His presence by the Spirit as He had done in the tabernacle is blessedly true: but there is more than this presented to us in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>-- the "greater and more perfect tabernacle" was there in principle <i>in the saints</i>.<a name=127:13></a> The <i>subjective</i> effect of the presence of the Spirit consequent on redemption is in evidence.<a name=127:14></a> All was in the power of the Holy Spirit (the only and all-sufficient power for the fulfilment of Christian responsibility) but what is presented is <i>accredited to the saints</i>.<a name=127:15></a> The church as set up in the power of the Spirit, as the responsible witness for Christ, is before us.<a name=127:16></a> The light, for the time at least, was undimmed.<a name=127:17></a> To say, as you do, that speaking of the church thus is exalting her instead of her Builder is as unfair as it can be.<a name=127:18></a> It glorifies Him, for she is His handiwork.<a name=127:19></a> The sin of Ananias was serious but it is <i>not presented</i> as the failure of the church in its responsibility.<a name=127:20></a> It was an attack of Satan on the Holy Spirit as in the church, but it was summarily dealt with -- the holiness of God's house was maintained.<a name=127:21></a> It is quite clear that latent evil shall

		You refer to the church at Ephesus in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2">Revelation  2</a>as the 'first word' of the Spirit to the church in responsibility.<a name=128:3></a> Surely you do not mean to assert that Paul's letter to the saints at Ephesus was later, or that this letter did not regard the church in responsibility.<a name=128:4></a> To say either would be utterly false.<a name=128:5></a> The epistles to the Corinthians regard the church in responsibility, as indeed do all the epistles.<a name=128:6></a> I will not give expression to my feelings but your remarks are inconsistent with the plain teaching and facts of Scripture.<a name=128:7></a> Even if it were admitted (which is impossible) that the letter to Ephesus in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2">Revelation  2</a>is the first communication of the Spirit to the church in responsibility, the <i>first word</i> is not "Thou art fallen;" the first word as to herself is commendation, as is well known.<a name=128:8></a> Besides the sense of the passage is not exactly "Thou art fallen", but "<i>from whence</i> thou art fallen".<a name=128:9></a> The candlestick is still there, though it would be removed if there were not repentance.<a name=128:10></a>

		On page 4 you speak of the <i>saints' righteousnesses</i> -- that these are produced in them through the service of Christ and their walking in the Spirit while they are here in responsibility; and that thus the Lord can, in grace, speak as though they had entirely done with themselves.<a name=128:11></a> Here again you show how the truth is really in your heart, for this is just what I understand to be the teaching of the word as to Christian responsibility.<a name=128:12></a> But you turn aside immediately to say that 'responsibility in Scripture stands in contrast to preservation by God in His sovereignty through a condition being maintained which is the result of a divinely given state'.<a name=128:13></a> You had been remarking about God triumphing on the 'responsible line', and that things done by the saints here in responsibility are credited to them.<a name=128:14></a> If the saints work righteousness by God's grace through the Spirit on the responsible line what is this but that they are preserved by Him in a 'divinely given state'.<a name=128:15></a> This is indeed the truth.<a name=128:16></a> We are created by Him in Christ Jesus for good works which were ordained that we should walk in them.<a name=128:17></a> We are preserved by Him and kept by His power, He working in us for His own will and pleasure.<a name=128:18></a> According to your remarks at the bottom of page 4, responsibility is in contrast to all this,

		whereas responsibility is bound up with it according to what you say in the former part.<a name=129:1></a> There is some truth in your remarks as to the angels who fell and those who did not, but the whole truth is not there; certainly if you carry the thought forward you will arrive at the error; you will suggest that the Lord, being elect, was not tested in responsibility.<a name=129:2></a> You clearly imply that the elect angels are not tested, for you set responsibility in contrast to their being preserved sovereignly.<a name=129:3></a> I am not prepared to say much as to the elect angels, but certainly the solemn charge to Timothy <i>before them</i> as to his responsibility would show that they know what it is to be under a charge.<a name=129:4></a> I believe, too, that they were tested and stood (compare <a href="../bible/Jude.htm#9">Jude  9</a>) being preserved by God, as you say.<a name=129:5></a> And it is quite certain that elect among men are tested in responsibility.<a name=129:6></a> The elect are seen as responsible in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3">Colossians  3</a>.<a name=129:7></a> As regards 'no responsibility in Christ', you will please remember what I have remarked many times to you that my exercise was to preserve the authority of Scripture as to it.<a name=129:8></a> It is of all importance to let Scripture speak for itself.<a name=129:9></a> It speaks of living godly in Christ Jesus, created in Christ Jesus for good works, approved in Christ, etc.<a name=129:10></a>, so that I accept the expression only in a modified way.<a name=129:11></a> Scripture is wiser than we are, and if we bow to it we shall be preserved from dogmatism.<a name=129:12></a> There is a region in which all things are of God -- where 'one' did not know whether he was in the body or out of it; here responsibility has no place.<a name=129:13></a> But as here on earth I am in Christ, and my responsibility flows from this.<a name=129:14></a> As J.<a name=129:15></a>N.<a name=129:16></a>D.<a name=129:17></a> says, 'Christian responsibility is the responsibility of being a Christian, that is, of walking, because we are in Christ, as Christ walked, through Christ dwelling in us' (Collected Writings, Volume 17, p.<a name=129:18></a> 452).<a name=129:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As to your remark that nothing connected with responsibility goes into heaven, I repeat that it is not true.<a name=129:20></a> As I have said, the Lord was connected with responsibility; He is in heaven; the church is connected with responsibility and she goes to heaven.<a name=129:21></a> You say that I do not prove J.<a name=129:22></a>B.<a name=129:23></a>S.<a name=129:24></a>'s statement incorrect.<a name=129:25></a> I do not wish to.<a name=129:26></a> I accept it as he meant it.<a name=129:27></a> I did not refer to it at all, as far as I can remember.<a name=129:28></a>

		Concerning the judgment seat of Christ I only called attention to a remark of yours (I am speaking from memory) that God cannot judge His own work -- that this did not quite tally with the facts presented.<a name=129:29></a> Scripture sets forth the principle of

	<div class="paragraph">
		In conclusion I would state that I have no such thought as that anyone could fulfil his responsibility as Christ did; nor do I know anyone who has.<a name=130:7></a> Scripture says that "in many things we offend all" (<a href="../bible/James.htm#3:2">James  3:2</a>).<a name=130:8></a> "Christ was in all points tested as we are, yet without sin".<a name=130:9></a> Hence the contrast.<a name=130:10></a> He was infinitely perfect in everything.<a name=130:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My exercise has been to get an understanding of the way Scripture looks at responsibility -- especially Christian responsibility.<a name=130:12></a> Scripture says that I "offend often" and at the same time insists that I fulfil my responsibility (see James); it is quite clear therefore that I am not disqualified for the fulfilment of responsibility, even though I offend.<a name=130:13></a> Paul came short of Christ's standard as we learn from Acts, but he says, "Be ye followers of me, as I also am of Christ".<a name=130:14></a> Scripture says that Paul was a follower of Christ and so was a model for others; hence it teaches that he fulfilled responsibility in this respect.<a name=130:15></a> Mark failed but "afterward repented and went".<a name=130:16></a> He was not disqualified by his failure for the resumption of a servant's responsibility.<a name=130:17></a>

		But there is a deeper consideration than isolated cases so clearly presented; the character of the dispensation is involved.<a name=130:18></a> Has there been a corresponding response in Christianity to the light presented by Christ?<a name=130:19></a> There has.<a name=130:20></a> To deny this is casting a shade on the mission of the Holy Spirit - to sin against Him.<a name=130:21></a> I have mentioned Paul, but I would cite his teaching as being more to the point (compare <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:1">Romans  5:1</a> - 5; <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:35">Romans  8:35</a> - 39; <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>- 4; <a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:18">1 John  5:18</a>;<a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:6">1 John  3:6</a>).<a name=130:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As to a 'Christian fulfilling his responsibilities' I believe my thoughts are the same as your own -- the same as are generally held among the saints.<a name=132:40></a> Of one thing I am sure and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=133>[Page 133]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		this is that "we all offend often", that whatever marked the saints at the beginning, the church has utterly failed in her responsibility.<a name=133:1></a> I am certain too that in Christ only do we see absolute perfection in the path of responsibility.<a name=133:2></a> Of Him only could it be said that He did <i>always</i> those things that pleased God.<a name=133:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But as regards Christian responsibility -- whether it may be said to have been fulfilled in any sense -- it is obvious that our enquiry should be 'How does Scripture view it?<a name=133:4></a>' As the English word 'responsibility' is not in the Bible, we simply employ it as many other words to express thoughts in Scripture which correspond with its ordinary meaning.<a name=133:5></a> It means -- 'The state of being responsible, answerable or accountable; that for which one is answerable, a duty, trust or obligation'.<a name=133:6></a> Does Scripture affirm or afford evidence that what is thus expressed found an answer in others than the Lord Himself?<a name=133:7></a> Unquestionably it does.<a name=133:8></a> Instances of it are too many to enumerate.<a name=133:9></a> I give a few: <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#4:7">2 Timothy  4:7</a>; <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3:17">Philippians  3:17</a>; <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:1">Ephesians  1:1</a>, 15; <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:14">Acts  2:14</a> - 47.<a name=133:10></a> A notable illustration is <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#14:26">Acts  14:26</a>: "The work which they had fulfilled".<a name=133:11></a> The Holy Spirit had called them to this work (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13:2">Acts  13:2</a>) and they had <i>fulfilled</i> it.<a name=133:12></a> The apostles were responsible (compare <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#9:16">1 Corinthians  9:16</a>, 17) for this work and they fulfilled it (compare <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#15:18">Romans  15:18</a> - 28).<a name=133:13></a> Here then is an instance of <i>fulfilled responsibility</i> according to Scripture, and this is in spite of the fact that <i>one</i> of these associates with the apostles (Mark) had failed!<a name=133:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the question of fulfilled responsibility goes deeper than isolated cases -- it involves what Christianity is -- the character of the dispensation.<a name=133:15></a> The teaching of Romans shows that God has triumphed through the gospel not only in being able in righteousness to justify the believer, but that the believer having the Holy Spirit <i>answers to God's requirements</i> -- "That the righteous requirement of the law should be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh but according to Spirit" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:4">Romans  8:4</a>).<a name=133:16></a> "Requirement" is, of course, what is demanded in the law (<a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#10:12">Deuteronomy  10:12</a>) and hence responsibility.<a name=133:17></a> It is said to be <i>fulfilled</i> (note the word) in us who walk not according to flesh but according to Spirit.<a name=133:18></a> Note: it is not said 'who <i>should</i> walk', but 'who <i>walk</i>' -- that is, it is presented abstractly, but, of course "us" refers to persons known to Paul including himself.<a name=133:19></a> A point has been made here that "fulfilled" refers to 'in' not 'by' but if it fails a

		I wish now to say a few words as to the things said at the meeting at Mrs.<a name=141:1></a> P------'s to which you refer.<a name=141:2></a> It was said that the Lord's reference to the disciples, "They have kept thy word" was not a question of their fulfilled responsibility, but one of 'fidelity', as chosen vessels, to the Father's name.<a name=141:3></a> 'Fidelity' according to the dictionary means 'faithfulness in the discharge of duty or obligation' and so implies fulfilled responsibility according to the measure of it in any given instance.<a name=141:4></a> Besides the words which the Lord uses would mean in ordinary human affairs that responsibility had been fulfilled.<a name=141:5></a> If I am responsible to do something and I do it and another says that I have done it, he means that I have fulfilled responsibility.<a name=141:6></a> Why should we deny this meaning to the Lord's words?<a name=141:7></a> Such handling of His sacred words leaves the impression on a simple mind that the Lord should have used different words.<a name=141:8></a> It is really (without intent, of course) undermining the authority of Scripture -- the Lord's own words.<a name=141:9></a> Of course the disciples were weak and failed in many ways as we all do, alas, and whatever they did that the Lord could commend was done by God's help.<a name=141:10></a> No true Christian would deny this.<a name=141:11></a> But the Lord must be allowed to speak in His own way, and His word in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>has the <i>same authority as it will have at the judgment seat</i>.<a name=141:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You further say as to Paul's statement, "I have kept the faith" that responsibility did not seem to be the point, that Paul protests elsewhere that he would not be justified in judging himself.<a name=141:13></a> What is overlooked here is that <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#4:7">2 Timothy  4:7</a> is an <i>inspired utterance</i>.<a name=141:14></a> It is not simply Paul as a responsible person passing judgment on himself.<a name=141:15></a> The Spirit of God causes the words to be written, and the words plainly say that a certain responsibility was fulfilled, who am I that I should deny it?<a name=141:16></a> The matter is really serious.<a name=141:17></a> Of course, there is more than fulfilled responsibility in the verse, as you very justly say.<a name=141:18></a> The fact that there had been no breakdown in the testimony committed to Paul is the chief thought.<a name=141:19></a> But this only emphasises that he fulfilled responsibility.<a name=141:20></a> He is, however, speaking of his services and the crown that would be his as given by the righteous Judge.<a name=141:21></a> As to the work given to Barnabas and Paul (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13">Acts  13</a>and 14) you set verse 27 of chapter 14 over against verse 26.<a name=141:22></a> There is beautiful moral order in the verses.<a name=141:23></a> The Holy Spirit in writing the history says the apostles fulfilled the work, but they tell the assembly "all that God had done with them".<a name=141:24></a> This is as it should be, and is very beautiful.<a name=141:25></a>

		But did not the Holy Spirit select the right words in verse 26?<a name=142:1></a> Did He mean what the words convey?<a name=142:2></a> Surely He did, and this notwithstanding that one of the number that had gone to the work had signally failed.<a name=142:3></a> So that while (as you justly insist and I heartily join you in this) the glory all belongs to God, He is pleased <i>to honour His servants</i>.<a name=142:4></a> Let us not deprive Him of this right.<a name=142:5></a> It is part of His glory.<a name=142:6></a> As to <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>you speak of your soul not resting in the manner of the saints fulfilling responsibility, but on the fact that divine grace and power kept them in unity.<a name=142:7></a> It is right that you should rest in this, dear Mr.<a name=142:8></a> Higgins, and I seek to do so myself.<a name=142:9></a> Surely it is in what God is and does that our souls should rest.<a name=142:10></a> But then we must think of what He rests in also.<a name=142:11></a> This should appeal to our hearts.<a name=142:12></a> It involves reconciliation.<a name=142:13></a> There were the wave sheaf (Christ) and the loaves (the saints) (see <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#23">Leviticus  23</a>).<a name=142:14></a> Both were <i>waved before Him</i>.<a name=142:15></a> The loaves refer to Pentecost.<a name=142:16></a> They were brought out of the peoples' houses, baked with leaven.<a name=142:17></a> The saints, as having the Spirit and exercised individually and bearing fruit in their ways and walk, are typified here.<a name=142:18></a> Hence while we enlarge on God's grace, and the power of the Spirit underlying all, we gladly allow the blessed God the right to speak as He pleases, He is pleased to enlarge on what the saints said and did.<a name=142:19></a> They are not eulogising themselves, the Spirit of God is writing their history.<a name=142:20></a> Let us not turn aside the meaning of His words.<a name=142:21></a> All was the fruit of divine grace surely, but it worked out through human hearts, minds, hands, feet, etc.<a name=142:22></a>, and God is pleased to accredit to them the precious results seen in His children.<a name=142:23></a> Every item of responsibility fulfilled in them is to His glory, but He is pleased to speak of them as doing it.<a name=142:24></a> To say that this is giving to the creature, glory that belongs to God is to impugn Scripture.<a name=142:25></a> It may have the semblance of piety, but it really tends to deprive God of His glory.<a name=142:26></a> See, for instance, in <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#1">1 Thessalonians  1</a>, how He accredits the saints with their "work of faith and labour of love, and enduring constancy of hope of our Lord Jesus Christ, <i>before our God and Father</i>".<a name=142:27></a> To use a figure, we do not honour a father of a well-behaved family by persisting to speak well of him while we ignore his children.<a name=142:28></a> He would speak of them (compare <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#8:18">Isaiah  8:18</a>).<a name=142:29></a>

		'rapture' of the saints, while they have disclosed a serious difference of judgment in certain quarters, will at the same time lead to a better understanding of the truth.<a name=145:1></a> As your letter states briefly what I understand to be correct as to the truth of Christian responsibility, I need not enlarge on the subject save to repeat that I am in agreement with you, as said above.<a name=145:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What seems to me to be overlooked is, that God has brought in, through and in Christ, an order of man in which He finds pleasure.<a name=145:3></a> This was announced at the birth of Christ: "Good pleasure in men".<a name=145:4></a> In contrast to men in the flesh, these men in whom God has good pleasure, fulfilled in the power of the Spirit, the righteous requirement of the law.<a name=145:5></a> The law was in Christ's heart and shall be written in the minds and hearts of men in the millennial day.<a name=145:6></a> Its righteous requirement (referring to Deuteronomy) is fulfilled in Christians now.<a name=145:7></a> Some have spoken of this as glorifying the creature rather than the Creator which is unaccountable in any brother of spiritual intelligence and consistency.<a name=145:8></a> It surely is to the glory of God that He has recovered man consistently with His own majesty through the death of Christ, and that the being thus recovered practises righteousness as God is righteous.<a name=145:9></a> It is a great moral triumph for God.<a name=145:10></a> Then there is the thought of the "new man" which is said to be "according to God is created in truthful righteousness and holiness" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:24">Ephesians  4:24</a>).<a name=145:11></a> That man thus created should fulfil responsibility in the discharge of obligations is surely to be expected.<a name=145:12></a> Indeed he is "created in Christ Jesus for good works".<a name=145:13></a> Scripture speaks of the Christians' good works and therefore we are entitled to speak of them.<a name=145:14></a> In speaking of them as Scripture does, no true Christian has the thought of glorifying the creature instead of the Creator.<a name=145:15></a> It is rather that through the believers' good works, God is glorified (see <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:12">1 Peter  2:12</a>).<a name=145:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It must not be overlooked that while we insist that everything is of God and for Him, that the glory is to be His, that He too glorifies His people.<a name=145:17></a> Scriptures which speak of this are too numerous to mention, but it is important that they should be borne in mind so that there may be a right balance of the truth maintained in our souls.<a name=145:18></a> We read of men "whose praise" is of God; Paul praised the Corinthians; he also speaks of the Thessalonians being His crown of boasting before our Lord Jesus at His coming.<a name=145:19></a> All this sets forth the mind of God as to any measure of the fulfilment of divine requirement in the

		There is further involved in connection with these things the truth connected with the children of God in John's epistle.<a name=146:3></a> They are seen to correspond with Christ in the practice of righteousness, etc.<a name=146:4></a> As regards 'recovery', there is nothing set out more clearly in Scripture than this principle.<a name=146:5></a> "David recovered all".<a name=146:6></a> I need not enlarge on the subject as your letter speaks clearly and definitely about it.<a name=146:7></a> <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15:32">Luke  15:32</a> is very pointed: "Thy brother was dead and has come to life again, and was lost and has been found".<a name=146:8></a> On this account "it was right to make merry and rejoice".<a name=146:9></a> I trust the Lord will bless you in your exercise and that you will reap of the 'spoil' that is sure to be available.<a name=146:10></a>

		(1) 'The centering of all God's purposes in the Second Man (morally the First) and not attaching to Adam'.<a name=147:17></a> This, to my mind, answers itself.<a name=147:18></a> All God's purposes surely centre in Christ.<a name=147:19></a> Adam can have no place save that of a sinner saved by grace (which I believe him to be) like the rest of us.<a name=147:20></a>

		Beloved Brother, -- I can well understand the difficulty our dear young brethren have to face just now, as I have had to do with it in Great Britain, and more recently I have gone through it with my eldest son Allen, who was 'called'.<a name=151:32></a> The most objectionable feature is the requirement that the claimant for exemption from conscription on conscientious grounds must belong to a religions sect or organisation.<a name=151:33></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In facing the problem the Christian should weigh all the facts of the present situation.<a name=151:34></a> It is clear that the government is not to be regarded as identical with the ruling power with

		which the godly remnant shall have to do in the future, <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#13">Revelation  13</a>; it is not specially acting against Christianity.<a name=152:1></a> We are to regard it as ordained by God and pray for those who administer it.<a name=152:2></a> We should, I think, take the words or terms they use in the spirit of them rather than in the letter.<a name=152:3></a> They evidently wish to exempt those who have had genuine conscientious religious objections to the taking of human life, and so make a provision which seems to them will ensure this; that is, the objector must show that he is a genuine case by proving that he belongs to such a sect or organisation as they mention.<a name=152:4></a> It seems to me therefore that as followers of Christ we should avoid being (or seeming to be) unreasonable, and so endeavour to follow their formal requirements as far as we can, taking them, as I said, in the spirit of them rather than the letter.<a name=152:5></a> Of course, no true enlightened Christian can admit that he belongs to a sect, but he cannot control what others call him.<a name=152:6></a> Paul said, "In the way <i>they call</i> sect, so serve I my father's God".<a name=152:7></a>

		In going through the matter with my son, I advised him to fill out the required form, bracketing the objectionable parts and adding notes explaining the scriptural exercises he had -- these notes outlining the principles held by himself and those with whom he walked in Christian fellowship, saying that they could not in the light of Scripture regard themselves as a sect.<a name=152:8></a> Appearing before the government representative another brother and myself explained more fully -- all with the result that exemption is so far granted.<a name=152:9></a>

		As regards 'non-combatant' service, I see no scriptural objection to it, and I doubt that one will get God's support in refusing the claim of the government to this extent.<a name=152:10></a> I believe those who have submitted to this service in Great Britain have found the Lord's sympathy and help.<a name=152:11></a> There is a great evidence of this.<a name=152:12></a> They have enjoyed the sympathy and support of their brethren, too.<a name=152:13></a>

What you remark about the impossibility of putting outside Christendom (the corrupt expansion of the Christian circle) is very important.

Of course, those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart (@ 2</a>Timothy 2: 22) are not so many separated individuals -- they are members of one another, they are to be governed by "every scripture" and hence 1 Corinthians has its place with them.<a name=157:12></a> It is part of the <i>truth</i> which they <i>love</i> especially as being as we may say the "law of the house".<a name=157:13></a> It is "my commandments" which every lover of Christ keeps.<a name=157:14></a> Ezra and Nehemiah (which we have been reading here lately with much profit) show how the ordinances through Moses and David were made to apply in a day of ruin.<a name=157:15></a> Conditions prevented the application of some, but all Scripture would be treasured by every true Israelite -- Ezra, for instance, who was

The principle taught in @ 2</a>Timothy as to sin is <i>withdrawal</i> from it or those who practise it.<a name=159:5></a> I need not quote the passages.<a name=159:6></a> But this in no wise negatives <a href="../bible/1Corinthianswhichepistleis,asitwere,"thelawofthehouse".Indeeditisremarkablethat@.htm#2">1 Corinthians which epistle is, as it were, "the law of the house". Indeed it is remarkable that @ 2</a>Timothy insists on the authority of all Scripture.<a name=159:7></a> Those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart value 1 Corinthians, only they humbly accept that conditions have changed, and so while they insist on the holiness and order of the house of God, they act according to the instructions in 2 Timothy, reinforced by the instructions (1 Corinthians) that governed the house at the beginning.<a name=159:8></a> The principle is the same, only the saints seek to rightly divide the word of truth and act wisely.<a name=159:9></a> In taking the ground of 'putting away' I am afraid of the danger of assuming that there is a special circle of fellowship (which would be within a fellowship), with assembly prerogatives.<a name=159:10></a> There is but one true fellowship which is Christian fellowship, and I would not like to assume that all 'outside' those with whom we walk are unfit for this.<a name=159:11></a> In judging sin in a person we judge it in the light of (indeed for) the whole church.<a name=159:12></a> That person is not fit for the society of true Christians, and so we cannot walk with him.<a name=159:13></a> But I must not say more now.<a name=159:14></a>

		First, it must be said that 2 Timothy is the special word intended to guide and govern the believer now -- evil being admitted within the sphere of Christian profession.<a name=160:11></a> This has been recognised by those through whom the word of God came and also by those who have received it in these last days.<a name=160:12></a> But it is well to remember that this is the very epistle that asserts the inspiration and profitableness of 'all Scripture' and that "the word of truth" should be rightly divided.<a name=160:13></a> It seems to me that this is to guard against any scripture being overlooked in the circumstances contemplated.<a name=160:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the exercise of discipline too, it is clear that the general conditions must occasion modification, although the holiness due to the house of God must ever be the standard; <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5">1 Corinthians  5</a>is the law of the house, so to speak, in respect of this, but it is obvious that verses 4 and 5 cannot apply <i>literally</i> now.<a name=161:3></a> It may be said, however, that verse 13 applies to any number of Christians under any circumstances; but the chapter is one whole and "yourselves" of verse 13, "ye" (verse 2), those "gathered together" (verse 4) refer to the same company -- addressed in the epistle as "the assembly of God which is in Corinth".<a name=161:4></a> To use these expressions now in an absolute way as <i>not including all Christians</i> in a given locality would be dangerously misleading.<a name=161:5></a> It is true that the "wicked person" is regarded in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5">1 Corinthians  5</a>as distinct from "yourselves", or the assembly (although really a believer as the sequel showed), but we cannot assume now that all believers not breaking bread are wicked persons.<a name=161:6></a> They are <i>brethren</i>, and we claim them as such, as belonging to the circle, and so we must include them, at least in principle, in any terms such as these mentioned which we may use.<a name=161:7></a> It seems to me therefore, that an act of discipline carried out formally on <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5:13">1 Corinthians  5:13</a> is not in keeping with the humbling conditions in which we find ourselves today.<a name=161:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2 Timothy is, I believe, the alternative, and it accords with the exercise of one truly humbled by the evil now manifest in the sphere of Christian profession.<a name=161:9></a> The principle there, is withdrawal from evil or those who practise it.<a name=161:10></a> This, of course, does not mean that each individual in the company would act separately in dealing with evil that might arise amongst them.<a name=161:11></a> As following righteousness <i>together</i>, they would necessarily act against evil together.<a name=161:12></a> The ground taken by each and all would be that sin must be refused, and so they refuse to walk

		Mr.<a name=163:6></a> Budd's 'suggestions' as to the breaking of bread do not seem to arise from Scripture.<a name=163:7></a> The paper suggests that the breaking of bread is <i>now</i> connected with the testimony, whereas in the early days it was connected with the local assembly -- at Corinth.<a name=163:8></a> What may be remarked is, that the Supper is a remembrance of Christ while He is absent.<a name=163:9></a> It was instituted by Himself and left with the disciples.<a name=163:10></a> It was afterwards received from Him by Paul who delivered it to the saints at Corinth, and of course to other assemblies.<a name=163:11></a> That it was connected with the 'testimony' and the 'local assembly' at the beginning and that it is connected with the testimony now (as the suggestions intimate) is true; but why it should not be connected with the local assembly <i>now</i> it is difficult to see.<a name=163:12></a> Is there a local assembly now?<a name=163:13></a> The 'suggestions' admit there is, but 'it cannot be convened'.<a name=163:14></a> But how are we to regard saints in a locality who do convene 'in the light of the assembly'?<a name=163:15></a> They are not the assembly surely, as already shown, but they are of it, and the 'local responsibility' attaching to it has to be accepted by them; the addresses to the "seven assemblies" teach us this in the true sense, not only a testimony in the place.<a name=163:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Turning now to your paper, I will seek to examine it as well as the article in question in the light of Scripture.<a name=165:9></a> I am prepared, I trust, for what there may be to learn or unlearn.<a name=165:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, I note that while you condemn the idea of a bond, as applying to the Christian, in the article, you accept it as taught in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>(page 4).<a name=165:11></a> You affirm, therefore, as the truth of Scripture, what you deny to be true in what another says.<a name=165:12></a> Your explanation that this is a marriage bond is of no value in this respect; if it is a bond in which a Christian has part (and the marriage figure certainly involves this, as you say) then your paper fails in its object -- it asserts what it condemns.<a name=165:13></a> As a matter of fact, <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7:5">Romans  7:5</a>, 6 teaches the very thing that the article was intended to impress the saints with -- nearness to God and to Christ in intelligent affection, service in "newness" of spirit and fruit for God.<a name=165:14></a> The reference in the passage (Romans 7) is to <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#19">Exodus  19</a>- 20.<a name=165:15></a> The article, however, did not treat the latter chapters as presenting the law itself as the first husband; it was viewed according to 'the spirit'.<a name=165:16></a> God would have the people near Him in a definite known relationship, which is referred to in the prophets as the marriage bond (compare <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#2">Jeremiah  2</a>; <a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#16">Ezekiel  16</a>).<a name=165:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I return to the earlier part of your paper, and I will quote what you write as expressing the matter to be considered: 'The question is on what principle the scripture places the fulfilment of these (Christian) responsibilities, whether that is, it is by the Spirit on the ground of pure grace and faith, where the God, whose love has reached us when we were yet sinners, is alone and ever before the soul, or whether it is on the ground of a contract or covenant, which a Christian has undertaken as one party to it, the other being the blessed God Himself'.<a name=165:18></a> What I would remark first is that the subject of the paper is 'Covenant relationships and family relationships'.<a name=165:19></a> Relationship, in the sense in which it is treated in the paper, means a
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		position in which persons are set; each has <i>part</i> in it.<a name=166:1></a> The point in the article is that the Christian should recognise this, and seek on his side, to enter into the blessed relationships in which it has pleased God to set him with Himself This is surely an important matter; any effort, however imperfect, to induce the saints to draw near to God is of Him and will be blessed of Him.<a name=166:2></a> The use of the words 'bond', 'contract', 'covenant' was simply to enforce the main thought in the reading, as mentioned above.<a name=166:3></a> I quote from the article: 'God's thought is that, as delivered, there should be an understanding between Him and us, and not only so, but a definite bond to which He has committed Himself to begin with, and to which we also have to commit ourselves, because it is in the committal to it that the conscience is brought into play.<a name=166:4></a> This chapter (Romans 7) shows, in the experience of at least one man, Paul, that he had found it a profitable bond' (pages 171, 172).<a name=166:5></a> Laying aside the principle of legal requirement (which the article does, as you admit), is this not a just statement of the matter -- at least in Paul's case?<a name=166:6></a> Was there not with him a definite understanding with God -- an apprehension of the relationship in which God had set him and an acceptance of the consequent obligations?<a name=166:7></a> Surely there was.<a name=166:8></a> At his conversion he enquired, "What shall I do, Lord?<a name=166:9></a>" This question was not rebuked, but carefully answered by the Lord.<a name=166:10></a> He was to learn in Damascus what he was to do.<a name=166:11></a> This question was the acknowledgement of the convert's <i>allegiance to Christ</i> -- a fact abundantly testified to in after years.<a name=166:12></a> It arose from the heart of one who afterwards said he delighted in the law of God after the inward man, with the mind served it, and, having received the Holy Spirit, fulfilled its righteous requirements.<a name=166:13></a> Was he under bondage to the law in a legal sense?<a name=166:14></a> Far from it, he was happy in his soul as in known relationship with God and with Christ and as "legitimately subject", as he says, "to Christ".<a name=166:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To enlarge on this somewhat I will refer to Romans.<a name=166:16></a> The connection between <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>, 6 and 7 and <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#19">Exodus  19</a>is quite obvious.<a name=166:17></a> The quotation I have made from your paper says that the fulfilment of Christian responsibility is by the Spirit on the ground of pure grace and faith, where God is alone and ever before the soul.<a name=166:18></a> This is <i>so far</i> true, but it is not the whole truth.<a name=166:19></a> It leaves out the exercise in the believer which leads him to accept his obligations to God, as revealed

	<div class="paragraph">
		The gospel was for obedience of faith among the nations; it was announced "on the principle of faith to faith".<a name=167:2></a> The necessity for the subjective state that <i>answers to God</i> is seen from the beginning, of which Paul is an illustration, as I have said.<a name=167:3></a> We see it also in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:37">Acts  2:37</a> and 16: 30.<a name=167:4></a> The principle you lay down corresponds, in measure, with <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>, but it really ignores chapter 6.<a name=167:5></a> The teaching of the latter chapter is <i>substantially</i> what the article insists on; it is based on baptism.<a name=167:6></a> Baptism, although necessarily administered by another, is nevertheless, a <i>committal</i> of the person baptised <i>to Christ;</i> he is baptised to Christ, and so to His death.<a name=167:7></a> The Ethiopian eunuch is an illustration of the correspondence between the believer's normal exercise and baptism.<a name=167:8></a> The believer undertakes it with a definite understanding of its bearing as to his path in this world.<a name=167:9></a> It is something to which he is committed (in principle, a bond) with which he is to be consistent.<a name=167:10></a> Hence "we <i>should</i> walk in newness of life".<a name=167:11></a> But while there is the acceptance of the obligation, the soul is not in legal bondage, for the obligation is not to the law, but to God.<a name=167:12></a> He is a bondman (this surely involves a bond) to God, and yields his members as instruments of righteousness to God.<a name=167:13></a> He has <i>his</i> fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.<a name=167:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in chapter 7 the believer is absolved from the claim of the first husband through Christ's death, to be married to another, to Him who is raised from the dead.<a name=167:15></a> Here is another feature of a bond -- the passage supposes a definite relationship established, which in Scripture involved a bond or contract between two parties.<a name=167:16></a> Doubtless this refers to the Christian's initial recognition of the marital relation between Christ and himself, but it results in fruit for God, and it lays the groundwork for the full position of the church as united to Christ.<a name=167:17></a> Elsewhere we are told that the saints were <i>espoused</i> as a chaste virgin to Christ.<a name=167:18></a> So that we have here clearly taught the principle which you contend against in the body of your paper, as already said, and which you admit at the end.<a name=167:19></a> It in no sense implies that Christian responsibilities are to be fulfilled on the principle of legal requirements; whether he is in relation of a bondman with God or, so to speak, a wife to Christ the responsibilities are carried out in the <i>liberty of love</i>.<a name=167:20></a> <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards Galatians, it will be quite clear from what I have said that the effort to place the article in company with the error the apostle combated there is entirely without justification.<a name=168:10></a> There is not the slightest evidence in the article that it was held by the speaker that the Christian's relationship with God is on any other ground than that of faith.<a name=168:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This subject is not <i>dwelt</i> upon in the article, for in such a small space every truth cannot be included, but it is <i>assumed</i>, as the '<i>believer</i>' is before the mind; a <i>believer</i> is one who has faith in God.<a name=168:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You say, 'The soul is seen as having died through law to the whole principle of what it can do'.<a name=168:13></a> What does this mean?<a name=168:14></a> Is there no principle of doing in Christianity?<a name=168:15></a> James says, "Faith without works is dead".<a name=168:16></a> True, thank God!<a name=168:17></a> My justification and relationship with Him are on the principle of faith, but Scripture insists on good works in the Christian.<a name=168:18></a> These works are accomplished by faith through the Spirit (faith working by love and not by the flesh) but they are viewed as the believer's works.<a name=168:19></a> Have I died to this principle of doing?<a name=168:20></a>

		The whole of page three of your paper seems to sound well, intensive pious expressions being employed, and in the main acceptable, <i>as far as it goes;</i> but as usual throughout the paper, <i>the responsible element in the believer is weakened</i>.<a name=168:21></a> You say, 'If I know anything of myself I would say, Christ is the Son of God and His love to me is an all-powerful object, and the Spirit of God is an almighty power within, but do not put me on a ground where I figure as undertaking anything, but let me remain on that of the faith of the Son of God'.<a name=168:22></a> If you are regarding yourself as in the flesh or merely in your own strength, you are certainly out of court as regards doing

		In conclusion I would say that I am far from contending for perfection in the expressions and form in which the truth was presented in the article in question.<a name=169:15></a> It was the substance of a reading at Glasgow in which, naturally, several took part; it was not revised by me, but I accept the entire responsibility of it.<a name=169:16></a>

		The question you bring up is one that has often exercised me, and I know it has been an exercise to many others.<a name=179:29></a> I see no difficulty in having the Lord's supper under the circumstances you mention, providing there is already a permanent local connection -- that is, one or more in fellowship residing there.<a name=179:30></a> But in the places you have in mind this is not the case, and hence you can hardly have what answers to the local assembly.<a name=179:31></a> But I am sure the Lord would value the thought of the brethren in coming together to wait on Him, and He would not disappoint their hearts as they come together.<a name=179:32></a> He would undoubtedly manifest Himself to them.<a name=179:33></a> In France last October, Mr.<a name=179:34></a> P.<a name=179:35></a> Lyon and myself met with a number of the dear N.<a name=179:36></a>C.<a name=179:37></a>C.<a name=179:38></a> brethren in this way and we were distinctly encouraged.<a name=179:39></a>

		As regards the body of your letter, it is possible that you have, since writing it, seen some account of certain meetings in London in March; if so, you will be aware that it came out, and was accepted generally as according to Scripture, that in dealing with cases of discipline now we act <i>publicly</i> according to <a href="../bible/2TimothyandprivatelyandbeforeGodwetakethegroundthatweareofthechurch(thoughnot*it*)andso@.htm#1">2 Timothy and privately and before God we take the ground that we are of the church (though not *it*) and so @ 1</a>Corinthians 5 is necessarily before us, as the "law", so to speak, "of the house".<a name=180:13></a> In our public attitude and statements we do not assume to be the church (in any given locality); but as bearing the Lord's name, we cannot walk with persons guilty of unjudged sin, and we say so as we refuse to go on with anyone found in that sad case.<a name=180:14></a> This is becoming, for outwardly all is ruin, and although we seek to be true to the Lord, we cannot disclaim responsibility for the ruin.<a name=180:15></a> In view of this it is utterly unseemly, and indeed quite wrong, for any company of Christians to assume <i>by the formula they use</i> to be an assembly.<a name=180:16></a>

		On the other hand, we know the precious fact that we are of the assembly; we recognise this, knowing the reality of it by the Holy Spirit -- all this necessarily enters into our dealing with one who may have sinned.<a name=181:1></a> We act together as before God in the light of the church, and this power (in measure at least) is with us, and thus discipline is made effective.<a name=181:2></a> But if a company of saints 'puts persons away' from itself and 'receives' to itself it is assuming by this (especially by the formal announcements made) that it is a church.<a name=181:3></a> This does not set aside the blessed fact, however, that a number of saints described in <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:22">2 Timothy  2:22</a> may enjoy church privileges.<a name=181:4></a> They may be clothed with <i>church</i> thoughts, so to speak; but this would be as before God -- not that the company is <i>a</i> church, but <i>of</i> it, as I said before.<a name=181:5></a> The Supper is, of course, public; but it does not involve administration, and there is no pretension in a few saints responding in this way to their Lord's request.<a name=181:6></a> It involves the church, for the loaf symbolises all, but it is not administration, as I said, and the absence of so many in any locality speaks of the ruin.<a name=181:7></a> There can be no question that the Supper is in order for those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity.<a name=181:8></a>

		My Dear Brother, -- I am glad to have your letter of September 15th.<a name=182:22></a> I had already heard of the objection by J.<a name=182:23></a> S.<a name=182:24></a> Giles to the Notes on page 194 Of July <i>Believer's Friend</i>, although his actual criticism has not reached me.<a name=182:25></a> The statement that the Lord's 'burial is part of His vicarious work' may seem more than should be said at first sight, but if the <i>meaning</i> of the word 'vicarious' is fully taken into account, its literal truthfulness cannot, I think, be denied.<a name=182:26></a> The general significance of the word is that one acts for, or takes the place of, another or others, and, of course, it is true that the Lord was in the grave <i>for us;</i> to say that He was there in any other sense would be serious indeed.<a name=182:27></a> In the passage under consideration at the reading reported (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:1">1 Corinthians  15:1</a> - 4) the apostle states the glad tidings he had preached to the Corinthians and by which they were saved unless they had believed

	<div class="paragraph">
		in vain: that Christ died for our sins; that He was buried; and that He was raised.<a name=183:1></a> Surely if the burial of Christ is thus formally presented as part of the gospel announcement by the apostle, its significance should be recognised; and if we compare the passages with others which treat of the Lord's burial, or entrance into the earth, we will see that He was in the grave, having died for others, on <i>their account</i>, not, in any sense, on His own.<a name=183:2></a> He was to be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth as a sign -- a sign surely of what was due to men, on whose account (He being the sinless One and immune from death) He was there.<a name=183:3></a> It was due to God that the One who became a substitute for men to atone for their sins on the cross and to end their sinful histories judicially should be buried for a definite period -- three days.<a name=183:4></a> The cross witnessed the awful penalty; the burial of Christ is the testimony that those for whom He suffered (believers) have disappeared judicially from God's sight.<a name=183:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Of course, the actual forsaking by God was while our Lord was alive on the cross, but there could be no atonement without His death, for without shedding of blood there was no remission; hence when He said, "It is finished" He necessarily included (anticipatively) His actual death.<a name=183:6></a> Indeed His burial and resurrection, as integrally bound up with the great work of redemption, were included in these precious words.<a name=183:7></a> The "corn of wheat" had to fall into the ground and die; the Son of man should be in the <i>heart of the earth;</i> He descended into the lower parts of <i>the earth</i>.<a name=183:8></a> The fact is that the cross, the actual death of Christ, and His burial are generally treated as one great event in Scripture, and hence His burial has to be regarded as connected with His vicarious work.<a name=183:9></a> Of course, if the word 'vicarious' is made to mean that the Lord was enduring the wrath of God while in the grave, I can see how the statement referred to would be regarded as error.<a name=183:10></a> It may be that the word is used theologically in this sense, and if so it may be well to insert a note in a number of <i>Believer's Friend</i> explaining that no such thought was meant to be conveyed.<a name=183:11></a> But the import of our Lord's burial should not be weakened.<a name=183:12></a> Perhaps you will let me know what you and others may think as to how the word is used, etc.<a name=183:13></a> I will gladly do anything to save the saints from difficulty, providing the truth is not in any way obscured or weakened in their minds.<a name=183:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The subject you mention is so infinitely precious and delicate that I hesitate to say much.<a name=186:24></a> I remember corresponding with Mr.<a name=186:25></a> W------ some years ago on it.<a name=186:26></a> What I fear is the danger of undertaking to define the Lord's relationships <i>before</i> He became Man.<a name=186:27></a> He is said to have been in the "form of God".<a name=186:28></a> His personal distinctness is, however, recognised, for the Word is said to have been <i>with</i> God.<a name=186:29></a> He speaks, too, Himself of the glory He had <i>with</i> the Father before the world was.<a name=186:30></a> But what can we say about these things, save to bow and worship, taking off our shoes, as it were?<a name=186:31></a> But He took Man's form and so came within the range of our apprehension, and yet He says that no one knows the Son, but the Father.<a name=186:32></a> This passage, I judge, refers to the inscrutableness of His Person; whereas the "Son of God" is to be known, His manhood being contemplated in this.<a name=186:33></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As I understand the truth, the Lord having become Man, the names or titles by which He is designated as in the past, present or future are such as applied to Him primarily as in this condition -- in manhood.<a name=186:34></a> The "Word" is said to have been

	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>God</i>, but it will not do to say that this designation applied to Him <i>then</i>, i.<a name=187:1></a>e.<a name=187:2></a> when in the form of God.<a name=187:3></a> It refers to Him as expressing the mind of God, or revealing Him, and so must strictly apply to Him as Man.<a name=187:4></a> The same remarks apply to the title "Only begotten Son".<a name=187:5></a> "Begotten" implies His manhood, I apprehend.<a name=187:6></a> Note -- it is "<i>is</i> in the bosom of the Father", not "<i>was</i>".<a name=187:7></a> The "Word" <i>was</i> God, etc.<a name=187:8></a> I understand the preposition "in", too, has the force <i>somewhat</i> of having 'come into'.<a name=187:9></a> This would bear out that the designation refers to the Lord as Man as indeed the context does.<a name=187:10></a> "This is my beloved Son, in whom I <i>have found</i> my delight" would correspond.<a name=187:11></a> What He was as loved of the Father as in the Godhead we can say nothing of (save as intimated, that He was God), but we can understand that as <i>Man</i> He became beloved -- no other <i>man</i> had His place.<a name=187:12></a> This is quite compatible with the love that always existed between divine Persons -- "<i>have</i> found" would hardly do as to this latter.<a name=187:13></a> The Lord speaks of the Son of man ascending to <i>where He was</i> before -- it would not do to draw from this that He was Son of man before He became Man; and yet the Son of man come from heaven, and He said of Himself when here that He was in heaven.<a name=187:14></a> His divine Personality is in view in these two well-known passages, but it would be wrong to say that because the Lord speaks of Himself as Son of man ascending to where He was before that this designation applied to Him before He took man's form.<a name=187:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we hold the truth of His blessed Person in our souls we will be jealous lest we should go beyond Scripture in speaking of Him; at the same time, we will be free to employ titles which were expressed in Him as Man, as Scripture does, in referring to the Lord either as in the form of God or the form of man.<a name=187:16></a>

		There was a private meeting to consider matters of difference that had arisen in connection with certain statements made by J.<a name=188:15></a>D.<a name=188:16></a>, especially at the meetings in Winnipeg of 1918, in the book entitled 'Life', and in the meetings at Chicago in 1920.<a name=188:17></a> Attention was called to a statement in the former that Christ could hardly be said to be eternal life as a Babe.<a name=188:18></a> J.<a name=188:19></a>D.<a name=188:20></a> said he had in his mind that He was not the expression of it and remarked that he had understood that when the apostles referred to Christ they referred to Him as they knew Him, and that this was not till after the Holy Spirit came upon Him.<a name=188:21></a> It was pointed out, however, that John in his gospel says, "The Word became flesh .<a name=188:22></a>.<a name=188:23></a>".<a name=188:24></a> and that this covered His incarnation from the outset.<a name=188:25></a> This was admitted to be the truth, and J.<a name=188:26></a>D.<a name=188:27></a> said that he would not make such a remark again.<a name=188:28></a> It was pointed out that the Lord spoke about being cast upon God from the outset.<a name=188:29></a> I would have been glad if D.<a name=188:30></a> had more readily acknowledged the truth as to the Lord's Person in this respect, as I strongly fear there had been a defect in his mind as to it.<a name=188:31></a> The Notes referred to were largely based on the assumption that Christ was presented as eternal life only after the Spirit came upon Him, and that the Holy Spirit in Him was the spring of eternal life as He is in us.<a name=188:32></a> In this line of thought I consider there is a grave defect.<a name=188:33></a> Although Christ is not said formally to be eternal life as a Babe, He is spoken of as "Saviour which is Christ the Lord", however, as a Babe.<a name=188:34></a> Besides, John states that "in Him was life" and we cannot limit this to any particular part of His incarnation.<a name=188:35></a> Negatives in this respect are the dangerous features.<a name=188:36></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the Notes of last year in which it was stated that the 'position' is 'intensely individual', and that no <i>company</i> can be said to be following righteousness, and that "faithful men" are the temple, J.<a name=188:37></a>D.<a name=188:38></a> and H.<a name=188:39></a>G.<a name=188:40></a> did not fully recognise the need of balancing these one-sided statements with the collective side of the truth.<a name=188:41></a> They did, however, admit the latter, to some extent, and as the Notes are not to be published, the matter was left, with the hope that things would not be again presented in this extreme way.<a name=188:42></a>

		At the readings we looked at <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#11">Acts  11</a>- 15 inclusive.<a name=189:1></a> There was marked interest and general unity.<a name=189:2></a> The object in the readings was to show how the parts of the tabernacle, so to speak, were linked up at the beginning.<a name=189:3></a> We were helped in seeing that divine wisdom and grace in the apostles and others overcame sectional and personal feeling, so that the work in various localities was linked together and co-ordinated, so that God had His portion and general unity was maintained.<a name=189:4></a> The correlation between authority, as presented in the apostles, and the free action of the Spirit in the saints generally came helpfully before us.<a name=189:5></a> The bearing of all this, as you can understand, was that the movements of the Spirit, at the present time, in different parts of the world, should not be isolated or sectional, but should be linked up and all set up in relation to Christ who rules over the <i>whole</i> house of God.<a name=189:6></a>

		<a name=190>[Page 190]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		hesitated to apply the title of "Son" to the Lord, before incarnation, but I do not think he was dogmatic on the point, and I remember him dwelling on <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:5">John  17:5</a>.<a name=190:1></a> "The glory which I had with thee before the world was".<a name=190:2></a> As far as I am able to say, my understanding of the subject has been governed by what I learned through F.<a name=190:3></a>E.<a name=190:4></a>R.<a name=190:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In view of <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#13:32">Mark  13:32</a>, I am unable to connect the term "Son" with our Lord as "in the form of God".<a name=190:6></a> It seems to me that it refers to Him only as having become Man.<a name=190:7></a> He was thus in the place of obedience and dependence, and hence one can understand that He could say that the Son did not know of the day or hour referred to.<a name=190:8></a> On the other hand, <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:2">Hebrews  1:2</a> speaks of the Lord as a divine Person under this title, and then He acted as one might say, mediatorially, <i>before</i> incarnation, that is, God made the worlds <i>by</i> Him.<a name=190:9></a> My mind is satisfied, however, that as in many other instances, the term "Son" here is employed by the Spirit to designate the Person who had then become Man.<a name=190:10></a> The Lord says elsewhere "What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#6:62">John  6:62</a>): this does not mean that the title "Son of man" refers to Him before He became Man.<a name=190:11></a> But whilst the title "Son" refers to Him as Man, it is generally intended to indicate His deity rather than His humanity; that is to say, it is not employed historically or as denoting a person among others, here on earth, like "Jesus".<a name=190:12></a> It usually indicates, as I said, the Lord's deity or dignity.<a name=190:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On the whole, I think the simple and safe attitude of mind to take up in regard of this immensely important subject is that one cannot undertake to speak <i>definitely</i> of the relationships that existed between divine Persons as viewed absolutely in the Godhead, or apply names that would designate these relationships.<a name=190:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I used to think that revelation was simply the unveiling of what had existed, that is, Father, Son and Holy Spirit; but subsequently came to see revelation was of God or the Father, as to His nature and attributes.<a name=190:15></a> The Lord formally states that no one knows the Son but the Father (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11:27">Matthew  11:27</a>).<a name=190:16></a> The thought of revelation applies only to the Father in this passage.<a name=190:17></a> The knowledge of the "Son of God" would refer to Him as Man, whereas <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11">Matthew  11</a>refers to His eternal Being.<a name=190:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have seen the paper Mr.<a name=191:18></a> W.<a name=191:19></a> Edwards has sent out, but I have not been able to go over it critically.<a name=191:20></a> I have no copy of it now so I cannot refer to it in detail.<a name=191:21></a> I have also seen Mr.<a name=191:22></a> Gill's letter to W.<a name=191:23></a> Edwards, for which I am most thankful.<a name=191:24></a> I have no doubt H.<a name=191:25></a> G.<a name=191:26></a>'s words shall have more weight than any I could write.<a name=191:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The question that arises in my mind in considering what W.<a name=191:28></a>E.<a name=191:29></a> has written is this -- has he the Father and the Son?<a name=191:30></a> I do not doubt that he is a Christian.<a name=191:31></a> I refer to what he professes to hold.<a name=191:32></a> I use the word 'professes', for I doubt that he <i>really</i> believes in his heart that God will <i>cease</i> to be Father in eternity or that Christ will cease to be Son.<a name=191:33></a> Possibly W.<a name=191:34></a>E.<a name=191:35></a> would object to the word 'cease', but this is what his paper implies, as I understand it.<a name=191:36></a> We are told that the <i>Son</i> shall be placed in subjection to God, having delivered up the kingdom to Him who is God and Father.<a name=191:37></a> What relation shall Christ be in to God then?<a name=191:38></a> Obviously He remains a Man, for He shall be in subjection -- is W.<a name=191:39></a>E.<a name=191:40></a>'s thought that He is just a Man (divine, however) but having no other relationship?<a name=191:41></a> Is God just <i>God</i> to Him, having given up the relationship of Father?<a name=191:42></a> If I go by Scripture the <i>Son</i> is to be in subjection, and the kingdom is given up to Him who is God <i>and Father</i>.<a name=191:43></a> Mr.<a name=191:44></a> Edwards' thought is in direct variance with <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:24">1 Corinthians  15:24</a> - 28.<a name=191:45></a>

		It seems as if the passage was written to rebuke such an error as Mr.<a name=192:1></a> Edwards'.<a name=192:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But to view the matter in a broader way, Mr.<a name=192:3></a> Edwards' thought sets the revelation of God in its most blessed bearing and eternal import aside.<a name=192:4></a> The scriptural presentation of revelation is that God, in shining out in His attributes, is seen in the relationship of Father to Man in Christ and to believers through redemption.<a name=192:5></a> This relationship was the subject of counsel before the world was, and so was no after-thought with God (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:4">Ephesians  1:4</a> - 6).<a name=192:6></a> In it we are before Him in love in Christ, as associated with Him, as His brethren.<a name=192:7></a> As foreknown we were predestinated to be conformed to the image of God's <i>Son</i> (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:29">Romans  8:29</a>) -- "so that", as it is said, "he should be the firstborn among many <i>brethren</i>".<a name=192:8></a> Mr.<a name=192:9></a> Edwards would, I understand by his paper, make all this a matter of 'recovery;' recovery is involved, as the less in the greater; the greater is that we are brought into what men even in innocency did not have -- which was, as I said, the subject of eternal counsel.<a name=192:10></a> For Mr.<a name=192:11></a> Edwards this precious blessing and favour that believers are brought into in Christ shall itself terminate, whereas, the Christian <i>normally</i> cherishes it as his greatest privilege, and this is how Scripture presents it.<a name=192:12></a> Besides, Mr.<a name=192:13></a> Edwards would deny to God throughout eternity what He must cherish supremely -- the affections of a Father reciprocated in the Son and the sons associated with Him.<a name=192:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I am very interested in the enquiry you raise, that of service to the young.<a name=195:38></a> There can be no doubt that God was in the effectual protest made some years ago against the extremes to which it had been carried by some; a regular system, corresponding with what was current in the 'nations' around, had developed.<a name=195:39></a> This was of a piece with the so-called evangelical activity, which at that period had taken the form of a 'special
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=196>[Page 196]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		interest' with certain ones; the tendency of all being to becloud or ignore the assembly and what Christ was ministering to it.<a name=196:1></a> But God came in for His people and brought about deliverance.<a name=196:2></a> Since then the truth of the house of God has been much before us, and in connection with this the truth governing the believer's household.<a name=196:3></a> There is scarcely a brother in fellowship now who does not recognise the obligation to the Lord to baptise his household, and correspondingly, the proportion of the children of the saints who turn to the Lord and accept the fellowship of His death is, I believe, much larger than it was in earlier years.<a name=196:4></a> Thus we can see that God is helping His people on lines in accordance with His truth and I am sure you will agree that we all should be strenuously on our guard lest we should be diverted or tend to divert others in any way.<a name=196:5></a> As for myself, I am wary lest I should say anything that would lead anyone to build again what he once destroyed as not according to God.<a name=196:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But at the same time Scripture remains as our infallible guide, and as we meditate upon it, in dependence on God, ready for adjustment, which we always need, we shall be adjusted, for movement in a rut is always to be avoided, and I do not see why any brother who has ability and exercise to serve the young, should not do so, in subjection to the Lord and his brethren.<a name=196:7></a>

		The Lord took little children in His arms, and laying His hands on them, blessed them (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#10:13">Mark  10:13</a> - 16).<a name=196:8></a> He treated them as a class in ordinary growth or development, and He was indignant with those who sought to prevent them coming to Him.<a name=196:9></a> Then in raising the son of the widow of Nain and Jairus' daughter, He used terms denoting that He took account of their age, as young persons.<a name=196:10></a> The apostle John wrote to the several grades of the family, as children, young men and fathers.<a name=196:11></a> Other scriptures too would show that gradations in age may be recognised in ministry, such as <a href="../bible/Ecclesiastes.htm#12">Ecclesiastes  12</a>, and as a matter of fact, every brother who ministers assumes this, for we continually hear the young appealed to, in addresses given by Christians.<a name=196:12></a> From what I have written, you can easily decide what my exercises are as to your enquiry and I trust my remarks may be of service to you.<a name=196:13></a>

		The thought was that as elders were appointed in cities ("established elders in each city, as I had ordered thee") any so appointed would have jurisdiction in the <i>entire</i> city in which he was, however many meetings there may have been in it; all the saints would thus come under his (or their) rule and get the benefit of his wisdom and experience.<a name=197:23></a> Hence in matters pertaining to the government of the assembly in a city, <i>all</i> the elders there should be taken into account.<a name=197:24></a> This was to correct

		My Dear Brother, -- I now send a line in answer to your remarks as to the Lord's supper.<a name=198:10></a> I understand that <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10">1 Corinthians  10</a>is the bearing of the thing on our walk, relations to each other, etc.<a name=198:11></a>, and that chapter 11 is the order or 'manner' of it, also that it is a memorial of Christ and a testimony to His death -- "the death of the Lord".<a name=198:12></a> The <i>memorial</i> is evidently connected with the breaking of the bread and blessing of the cup, and the communion and public testimony with the eating and drinking.<a name=198:13></a> When the Lord said, "Do this" He referred to what <i>He</i> did, and it was by this He was to be remembered; <i>He</i> did not eat or drink -- of course He partook of the <i>passover</i>.<a name=198:14></a> The <i>eating and drinking is connected</i> with the testimony, <i>not</i> breaking of the bread.<a name=198:15></a> You speak of the latter as the 'public act;' of course it is public as being a physical action, but as I said, the public feature in the Lord's supper is said to be the eating and drinking, whereas the breaking of the bread is said

		The breaking of bread is, of course, included in the Lord's supper, but where it is spoken of by itself and connected with the first day of the week, as in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20">Acts  20</a>, I think it has an <i>inward</i> bearing; as we are reminded of Christ in it thus the way is open into all that the <i>first</i> day suggests.<a name=199:4></a> The designation "Lord's supper" is used only in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11">1 Corinthians  11</a>, and obviously stands connected with the Lord's authority and testimony in the assembly.<a name=199:5></a> Thus we have "ye do <i>show</i> the Lord's death".<a name=199:6></a>

		The thought before us at the reading you refer to was that, as Scripture recognises only one assembly in a city the saints in a given city or town should not only assent to this, but should act together in a most practical way.<a name=199:12></a> As elders are said to be ordained for <i>cities</i>, an elder's jurisdiction would extend to the whole city in which he lived, although there might have been several meetings in it.<a name=199:13></a> Thus his wisdom and experience would be available to all the saints in the place.<a name=199:14></a> This would work out to the advantage particularly in cases of discipline, which might be difficult otherwise.<a name=199:15></a> As regards all the saints coming together in one place, I do not at all see that this ("one place") refers to the <i>locality;</i> the saints were addressed as at Corinth and if they came together it would, of course, be there.<a name=199:16></a> The form of expression and context precludes entirely it seems to me, that the city merely is referred to.<a name=199:17></a> In <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14:23">1 Corinthians  14:23</a> the "whole assembly" is contemplated as coming together in one place, and a simple person <i>entering in</i> -- surely this does not refer to him entering into the city.<a name=199:18></a> I note your remarks as to the unlikelihood of rooms or halls sufficiently large to accommodate all being available, which are interesting; but I do not see that we should assume that there was not such accommodation

		Beloved Brother, -- I was pleased to receive your letter of October 22nd.<a name=202:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe Numbers indicates how a Christian should take up his responsibility, first by the standard of his father's house, and then widening out to his special group of tribes and to the whole camp.<a name=202:13></a> From the outset he is set in relation to the tabernacle which would be the great governing thought.<a name=202:14></a> But in seeking to act according to the above, the great exercise should be to do so in a <i>spiritual</i> way, otherwise we become geographical and parochial.<a name=202:15></a> Indeed I believe a danger exists in the latter connection, I mean the recent custom of grouping certain meetings together, and regarding them as 'a district' involving 'district exercises'.<a name=202:16></a> This is just parochialism, and, in time, will work mischief.<a name=202:17></a> That you, as in Lewisham, should be <i>specially</i> concerned about meetings adjacent (north, south, east and west) is right, and the more you are with the Lord the wider your area will become, but to mark off a certain number of your neighbouring meetings, and regard them as your 'district' has no scriptural warrant that I can see.<a name=202:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christians are characteristically children of wisdom, and much is left to us in detail; wise arrangements, may, therefore, be made for general convenience and profit.<a name=202:19></a> But to prevent brethren outside any given 'district' from attending meetings for fellowship for any other reasons than of physical convenience is not in keeping with the truth of the body of Christ.<a name=202:20></a>

		Beloved Brother, -- Since hearing of the death of your dear brother Samuel I have been wishing to write to you all.<a name=203:13></a> My wife and I feel keen sympathy with you and Mrs.<a name=203:14></a> Hansen, but especially with dear bereaved Mrs.<a name=203:15></a> Lindberg and her children and we will be obliged if you will kindly tell her so.<a name=203:16></a> You may be assured that our prayers go up for your sister and the children.<a name=203:17></a> We feel sure she will be comforted in the knowledge that her dear one is with Christ, which, as Scripture says, "is far better".<a name=203:18></a> Then she will also be comforted by the love and care which we are sure will be shown her by you all.<a name=203:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My wife and I had great fears about Samuel's health and so we were not surprised to hear that he had fallen asleep.<a name=203:20></a> Sometimes the Lord is pleased to intervene and restore one of His own to health, but generally the course of God's government proceeds with us as with the rest of men; faith accepts this in the light of resurrection and everlasting life -- indeed falling asleep, or dying, is but going to be with Christ, which love desires.<a name=203:21></a> Thus death is ours.<a name=203:22></a> But nevertheless it is right that God's hand should be recognised -- that there is discipline in our loved ones being taken from us.<a name=203:23></a> It is right also to have the sense of bereavement, for to be without natural affection is apostasy (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#3">2 Timothy  3</a>).<a name=203:24></a> But the Lord comes in to fill the void created, and I trust dear Mrs.<a name=203:25></a> Lindberg will make up her mind that no one else really can fill it.<a name=203:26></a> She will find thus that in drinking the bitter waters (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15">Exodus  15</a>) the knowledge of the

		In this country the Lord encourages us all much, especially in special meetings held in different places.<a name=204:6></a> There have been such meetings lately in Toronto, Detroit, Council Bluffs, Winnipeg, Plainfield and Montreal.<a name=204:7></a> Besides, a good few have been restored from 'Glanton' during the past few months.<a name=204:8></a> You will know that P.<a name=204:9></a>L.<a name=204:10></a> is in South Africa.<a name=204:11></a> My wife and I hope to go to Australia in March, please God, I am sure we may reckon on your prayers.<a name=204:12></a>

		Beloved Brother, -- Your letter of January 16th has remained unanswered longer than I intended but I have been greatly pressed for time so I am sure you will pardon.<a name=206:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I kept no copy of my letter relative to 'District Meetings', but I did not intend to convey the thought that I objected to them as I have seen them, but rather, as you say, the abuse them.<a name=206:24></a> As this is what the letter conveyed to you I do not suppose either alteration or addition is -needed.<a name=206:25></a> From your letter I judge that your mind in the matter differs nothing from mine.<a name=206:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I do not see any scriptural justification for limiting a meeting arranged for <i>ministry</i> except what may be necessary for physical convenience.<a name=206:27></a> Anything else, it seems to me, is not a recognition of "the unity of the Spirit", and the universality of gift.<a name=206:28></a> The saints are wisdom's children, and much is left to our wisdom, the existence of love being assumed, as moving in the recognition of the general principles which are
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=207>[Page 207]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		to govern the house of God, but if anything is introduced infringing on any of these principles, it is due to the Lord that attention should be called to it.<a name=207:1></a> If, therefore, a meeting for fellowship, ministry, etc.<a name=207:2></a>, is arranged in a given place, and a brother with ability to help the saints, living nearby and wishing to attend is prevented because of <i>district</i> limitations, then, it appears to me, the principle governing levitical service is interfered with.<a name=207:3></a> Further, if saints in general are prevented by <i>district</i> limitations, the truth of the body of Christ is interfered with.<a name=207:4></a> Other modifications besides those required by physical convenience may exist, such as the judgment of the saints as to the brother or brothers whose ministry would be most suited on a given occasion, but this comes under the head of wisdom, and does not infringe a levitical principle.<a name=207:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am doubtful, too, as to the scripturalness of a 'District Meeting' that is, a meeting having such a fixed character.<a name=207:6></a> I think the idea of a meeting, or coming together in one place should have the assembly in the locality as its basis, not a number of assemblies.<a name=207:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It will be observed that in addressing the Galatians the apostle says, "The assemblies of Galatia", that is, the exercise or obligation of the error would be on each <i>local</i> company.<a name=207:8></a> He does call them "senseless Galatians" later on to bring home the error to every one of them, but the formal address is to the assemblies, whereas, the Colossians are addressed as "faithful brethren", but when the letter is directed to be passed on to Laodicea it is to "the <i>assembly</i> of Laodiceans".<a name=207:9></a> The responsibility involved in the epistle applied in each locality.<a name=207:10></a> There is no hint of a joint meeting.<a name=207:11></a> The apostle further says, "And that ye also read that from Laodicea", and so the seven assemblies in Asia (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2">Revelation  2</a>and 3), they are addressed severally.<a name=207:12></a> In a word, it is clear that the local assembly is the basis for coming together, direct responsibility being connected with it.<a name=207:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In view of all this I have a certain apprehension of danger in the country being divided into districts with corresponding limitations.<a name=207:14></a> There is a tendency towards the parochial and even diocesan systems of the State Church.<a name=207:15></a> There is no warrant in Scripture for a church in a district as including all the companies in it, or for a National Church.<a name=207:16></a> The economy of the assembly is worked out in assemblies and all coming together into one place is in this connection, as far as I see, and not in relation to districts or countries.<a name=207:17></a> Jerusalem, as we see

		From Sydney we went to Newcastle, where Mr.<a name=211:8></a> Guy Allbut lives.<a name=211:9></a> We had a happy time there, but we were saddened after the meetings by a serious illness which seized our dear brother W.<a name=211:10></a> J.<a name=211:11></a> House.<a name=211:12></a> He has been ill ever since and during the present voyage we received a wireless to say that he was to have been operated on eight days ago.<a name=211:13></a> We are anxiously awaiting further news: our brother is greatly valued.<a name=211:14></a>

		Many notices had been circulated and many 'outsiders' attended.<a name=211:18></a> There are three meetings in Brisbane and several comparatively near, so that the meetings ranged from three to five hundred.<a name=211:19></a> There are several good brothers and sisters there and some aggressiveness in testimony.<a name=211:20></a> They have a Tract Depot.<a name=211:21></a> There are Depots in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Auckland, Wellington and, I believe, Christchurch.<a name=211:22></a>

		My Dear Brother, -- Your letter of the 18th ult.<a name=216:11></a> and enclosure duly received.<a name=216:12></a> I am very interested in all you write and the information as to 'London'.<a name=216:13></a> I heard lately that the brethren have decided to take the County Council area as defining the City, but this has not been confirmed.<a name=216:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to your letter I would remark that the County of London differs from the other counties in the very important feature that it is designated <i>Metropolitan</i>.<a name=216:15></a> The tax bill you forwarded is headed 'Metropolitan Borough of Camberwell'.<a name=216:16></a> This means, of course, that Camberwell is part of the Metropolis or chief city of the country.<a name=216:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then under the heading 'London Government' appears 'The Authorities comprise the Corporation of London, the London County Council, the Metropolitan Water Board, the Metropolitan Asylums Board, 28 Borough Councils, and 28 Boards of Guardians'.<a name=216:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Under the heading of 'London Cities (incongruous) and Boroughs' we have the population of London by itself <i>inclusive of all the 'cities' and boroughs</i>.<a name=216:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is impossible therefore to avoid the conclusion that the city of London, Westminster and the Boroughs form a complete whole, the Metropolis of the Country; in other words, this is <i>London</i>.<a name=216:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It seems clear then that if we speak of the assembly in London we have to include all these cities and boroughs.<a name=216:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I quite see the difficulty the dear brethren have to contend with, for the number of meetings involved makes it hard for those who have the care of the saints (the 'elders' ) to deal directly with all in the City.<a name=216:22></a> God has helped them hitherto,

		My Dear Brother, -- In answer to your enquiry I would say that governmental limitations are not to intrude into the liberties and privileges of the house of God to which all Christians belong, whatever their race or colour.<a name=219:6></a> In the government of God the Negro races labour under certain limitations, but I do not see any evidence of a curse in this fact.<a name=219:7></a> As you say, the curse was pronounced on Canaan; but this was in view of his position in the promised land, and there is no indication in Scripture or history that the Canaanites were black.<a name=219:8></a> It may be further remarked that the rulers of the ancient world from Babel were Hamites, including the Egyptians, and these were not black.<a name=219:9></a> The limitations governing the Negro races also govern the Asiatic races in a more limited degree.<a name=219:10></a> The so-called white races maintain rigid separation generally in regard to these Asiatic peoples.<a name=219:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In view of these facts we have to conclude that what marks off the Africans and Asiatics from the Europeans is due to moral and climatic conditions, and while the government of God enters into this fact the restrictions involved are not the outcome of a curse directly or indirectly.<a name=219:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In our <i>public</i> relations it is not right to disregard the governmental limitations that exist, but grace in the Christian would go a long way toward minimising this; certainly we should be free to visit our coloured brethren and should recognise them as of the family of God.<a name=219:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As gathered together in the assembly, the colour line should be wholly ignored; if a coloured man has the Holy Spirit his position the assembly is exactly the same as that of a white man who has the Spirit.<a name=219:14></a> If we are to go by <i>names</i> one would gather that there was a coloured man in the assembly at Antioch -- <i>Niger</i>.<a name=219:15></a> If the Ethiopian eunuch had returned to Jerusalem after he was converted can there be a doubt that he would be accorded the full place of a brother among the saints?<a name=219:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards inter-marriage between white and coloured persons, this, to say the least, is not seemly, and "love does not behave in an unseemly manner".<a name=219:17></a> It is wise for Christians to leave governmental conditions until God alters them.<a name=219:18></a> Our relations in the assembly are, as I said, another matter.<a name=219:19></a>

		Beloved Brother, -- As regards Mediatorship I think my remarks which troubled you are quite scriptural, and I am confirmed in this by recent consideration of the matter.<a name=224:24></a> When you say -- 'the mediator stands related to God, whereas revelation is connected with the Father' -- you are hardly correct.<a name=224:25></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:18">John  1:18</a> connects revelation with God.<a name=224:26></a> "No one has seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, <i>he</i> hath <i>declared</i> Him".<a name=224:27></a> "Declared" has reference to God clearly, although declaration involves the Father of course.<a name=224:28></a> What was needed was one who could "lay his hand upon both" -- God and men; the "daysman" corresponds with the Mediator although become Man -- the Word became flesh -- He can lay His hand upon God for personally He is God.<a name=224:29></a> You say that the Mediator implies that He took a place lower than angels.<a name=224:30></a> Surely as become Man He was in

		What has exercised me is the repeated statement of Scripture that no one had seen God at any time: that thus to make Him known, One capable of laying His hand on Him and on man was needed, as Job saw.<a name=228:17></a> I have regarded therefore that mediatorship necessarily involves the Lord's Person (His divinity) as well as His manhood; so that while John does not use the word, mediatorship is implied in the declaration of God.<a name=228:18></a> It is through, or by, the only-begotten Son, a divine Person but as Man, for otherwise He would not be within man's range.<a name=228:19></a> It is dependent on the Word becoming flesh.<a name=228:20></a> Men are in view particularly in <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#2">1 Timothy  2</a>, and so "the man Christ Jesus".<a name=228:21></a> John's gospel and 1 Timothy 2 would cover Job's requirement; the 'official' references (Hebrews) relate to the New Covenant and so are more limited.<a name=228:22></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>eternal life is given by Christ as <i>given</i> authority over all flesh, which is mediatorial.<a name=228:23></a> In the 'eternal state' God being with men tabernaclewise is, I am sure, in principle mediatorial.<a name=228:24></a> Indeed the more one dwells upon what God is (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#6:15">1 Timothy  6:15</a>, 16) he cannot but be convinced that to have to say to Him, be in relationship with Him, <i>must</i> be on the principle of mediatorship -- He being what He is and we being what we are.<a name=228:25></a> But I will not say more on this great subject, knowing that you will see what I have in my mind by what I have written, although

		My letters from which you quote were based on facts submitted at the time; they were tentative professedly and not final, and the fuller information I have now shows no real discrepancy in them.<a name=234:5></a> What I said was London is London in an attenuated sense, but still London.<a name=234:6></a> Centrifugally London has worked out to limits that brethren have wisely decided should not be reckoned for the purpose on hand; but nevertheless the area is London in a sense.<a name=234:7></a> The extraordinary incongruity of the facts governing the London area precludes definiteness, and this consideration by itself should induce great forbearance in all concerned.<a name=234:8></a>

		I quite accept that the direct responsibility of this boundary matter lies with those who reside in London, but responsibility as to change that may go wider because of it, belongs to all.<a name=234:9></a> It was on this ground I ventured to write you, for the extension of the boundary, which occasioned the discussion, was not an infringement of the principle you insist on, but a more consistent application of it in view of the changed conditions through recent growth and governmental enactments.<a name=234:10></a> I am most thankful for your assurance that Forest Hill brethren will not press their view, but the divergence, like the letting out of waters, may go far beyond your control or that of others.<a name=234:11></a> Hence the great urgency of brethren patiently seeking to see eye to eye so as not to give place to the devil.<a name=234:12></a> The possibility that saints may need to pore over parliamentary Acts and municipal laws and statistics to determine whether Forest Hill or the rest of London is right is distressing in the extreme.<a name=234:13></a> May the good Lord save us from such a disaster!<a name=234:14></a> I believe it is in your hands to avert the danger, and I beg of you, dear brother, to consider as before the Lord whether this is the case and seek to help your brethren in this crisis.<a name=234:15></a> I believe you would please the Lord by giving up digging into these worldly things; the occupation must be defiling and deadening.<a name=234:16></a> A large

		Beloved Brother, -- I am glad to have your letter of recent date.<a name=235:20></a> The matter you mention often comes up.<a name=235:21></a> What is to be observed is that preaching is dependent on gift or qualification for it in Scripture.<a name=235:22></a> "How shall they preach unless they have been sent?<a name=235:23></a>" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#10:15">Romans  10:15</a>).<a name=235:24></a> Thus the first preaching (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>) is by Peter, who "stood up with the <i>eleven;</i>" it does not say, 'with the 120'.<a name=235:25></a> This is in keeping with <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#3">Mark  3</a>, where the Lord is said to have appointed twelve that they might be with Him, and that He might send them to preach.<a name=235:26></a> Another thing of great importance in this connection is that the assembly as
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=236>[Page 236]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		such does not preach or teach, in spite of Rome's claims falsely based on <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:17">Matthew  18:17</a>.<a name=236:1></a> It is taught.<a name=236:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In view of what is said above, the preaching of the gospel in a locality is not the direct responsibility of the meeting (although, of course, normally all would be exercised about it, sympathetic with it), but of those who are in any way fitted for it.<a name=236:3></a> Some brother or brothers qualified wish to serve in this way (woe to them if they do not, <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#9:16">1 Corinthians  9:16</a>) and he or they ask for the use of the meeting-room for this purpose.<a name=236:4></a> They carry on the service with the fellowship of the saints.<a name=236:5></a> If they do not preach on a given evening they see that someone fitted by the Lord does.<a name=236:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is obvious from above that the brother 'in charge' of the gospel is not an official but rather one engaged in the Lord's service in the proclamation of the gospel; nor is his function to provide preachers merely, but to carry on the service himself as far as he may have ability.<a name=236:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Of course, as in all else, love and consideration for others must enter into the practical working out of the matter, or rivalry and jealousy will ensue.<a name=236:8></a> The wisdom from above is without partiality and hypocrisy.<a name=236:9></a> Thus the brother responsible would secure brothers elsewhere specially qualified in preaching the gospel -- thinking <i>only</i> of the Lord's interests.<a name=236:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Sometimes one hears of brothers in a meeting preaching <i>in turn</i>, whether there be gift or not -- this, I am sure, is a mistake.<a name=236:11></a> As I said, preaching should be by those qualified or "sent".<a name=236:12></a> Of course, one must have opportunity to show whether he has ability, but this can be given -- if ability exists it will soon be apparent.<a name=236:13></a>

		As stated, my object in writing you at first -- in June -- was not to enter into the 'boundary' matter but rather to urge the importance of the judgment arrived at by the 'many' in London with the hope that you might see your way to fall in with it, especially as the brethren generally accepted (as I then thought and still believe) the principle insisted on by you, and as your attitude tended to cleavage among the saints.<a name=240:8></a>

		In replying to my two letters you have not dealt with my suggestion as to your moral obligation to your brethren locally and generally.<a name=240:9></a> This obligation is found specially in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:1">Ephesians  4:1</a> - 6.<a name=240:10></a> That passage contains a principle of, <i>at least</i>, equal importance with the one you are insisting on -- that 'we accept what exists under the government of God'.<a name=240:11></a> Of course Ephesians 4 applies to us all, and it may seem that your brethren in the 23 meetings have not been governed by it in their recent relations with Forest Hill, but it has now a peculiar application to all in Forest Hill and the meetings at Dulwich and Eltham.<a name=240:12></a> You all are holding aloof from the mass of your brethren in London in the matter in question on grounds that can be determined only by wise brotherly conference as to existing secular facts, for notwithstanding the quotations you furnish from the brothers mentioned, the brethren <i>do</i> hold the principle you are contending for.<a name=240:13></a> Their remarks are due in the main (I may say, entirely) <i>to the extraordinarily complicated laws and customs governing London</i>.<a name=240:14></a> As I said, the brethren in London are really with you as to the principle, and I am assured that if they and the brethren in Forest Hill and the other two meetings come together in the fear of the Lord and as seeking in all lowliness and meekness to keep the unity of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace, a way will be made for you all to walk happily together.<a name=240:15></a> The above was what was in my mind in writing you and I do urge on you now -- using the liberty which your kind words give me -- to consider earnestly what I write.<a name=240:16></a>

		As to the seeming inconsistency in my letter to you as compared with one to ------, I would say that this is accounted for by the London boundary and governmental complications referred to above.<a name=241:2></a> When writing to you I was dealing with these latter, but when writing ------, I had the principle you are contending for in mind.<a name=241:3></a> In <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#7">1 Corinthians  7</a>the apostle, for a certain reason, directs that each man should have his own wife while throughout the chapter celibacy is encouraged.<a name=241:4></a> I need not say there is no inconsistency.<a name=241:5></a> When writing ------, I was contending for the general principle that we should accept what 'the powers that be' ordain as to city or other boundaries, but when writing you I was seeking to show that this was not the real issue in London but rather the application of it; that the extremely complicated governmental circumstances there made this most difficult -- that it was thus a question of what should be regarded as London for the purpose on hand, so that the general principle could be applied.<a name=241:6></a> I hope you will see by what I point out that there is no inconsistency in the correspondence.<a name=241:7></a> I should gladly be of service to Streatham as you suggest, but I am assured, as I said, that the remarks expressed there were occasioned by conditions in London and not opposition to the principle you maintain.<a name=241:8></a> Mr.<a name=241:9></a> Dolton's letter specially commends itself; he says, 'It is largely a question of' wisdom 'as to where we draw the line'.<a name=241:10></a>

		I must add a word as to your treatment of the cities mentioned in the Old Testament.<a name=241:11></a> You write, 'I submit that none of the great cities of Scripture represent the idea of locality'.<a name=241:12></a> This is certainly an extraordinary suggestion.<a name=241:13></a> "Go to Nineveh" -- locality is implied there unquestionably.<a name=241:14></a> That Nineveh represents certain moral features, as you say, is of course true, but it was not to <i>these</i> Jonah was sent but to the place; this is too obvious to require anything more to be said to prove it.<a name=241:15></a> Indeed Scripture actually indicates its dimensions.<a name=241:16></a> Locality is said by the best authorities to mean, 'a definite spot, point, neighbourhood, site; especially geographical position'.<a name=241:17></a> It cannot be denied that any city answers to this definition.<a name=241:18></a> That the great cities of Scripture are regarded as representing more than what was local to them is, of course, true; this is indeed true of all cities ancient and modern, but it also is palpably true that each is and was a locality.<a name=241:19></a> The

		I am sure we shall show wisdom and humility if when treating of material or earthly matters with which we have to do under the government of God, we speak of them as they are known by man in a general way.<a name=242:12></a> Thus while <i>much</i> may be said of the origin and technical meaning of the word 'city' its common or general signification should suffice for those who seek to recognise what exists under the government of God.<a name=242:13></a> The Encyclopaedia Britannica says, 'In common usage, however, the word implies no more than a somewhat vague idea of size and dignity, and is loosely applied to any large centre of population'.<a name=242:14></a> Thus while, technically, the City of London is quite small, London is yet properly described as the largest city in the world.<a name=242:15></a> I quote this only for the general idea, holding that boundaries should be determined, etc.<a name=242:16></a> It is in this sense unquestionably that God takes account of it and so has witnessed to it in grace during these many centuries.<a name=242:17></a> Brethren have sought to recognise this throughout and I believe they are doing so now, notwithstanding apparent incongruity on account of the conditions I have mentioned.<a name=242:18></a>

		I am sorry you think me 'unwise' in continuing to say that the London County Council is an overruling body.<a name=243:4></a> As I frequently said, the facts known to me prove that it is.<a name=243:5></a> I have not the Local Government Act, which you sent me, to quote from, but I give what I am sure is authoritative in this respect -- the Encyclopaedia Britannica.<a name=243:6></a> 'In 1888 the Local Government Act, dealing with the area of the metropolis as a separate County, created the London County Council as the central administrative body, possessing not only the powers of an ordinary County Council, but also extensive powers of <i>town</i> management'.<a name=243:7></a> Under 'Sanitation' it further says, 'The County Council deals directly with matters where uniformity of administration is essential .<a name=243:8></a>.<a name=243:9></a>.<a name=243:10></a> it has certain powers of supervision and control <i>over</i> local authorities .<a name=243:11></a>.<a name=243:12></a>.<a name=243:13></a> outside the jurisdiction of local authorities'.<a name=243:14></a> As London (the great city) is the subject of the law thus dealt with and as its subdivisions are called 'Metropolitan Boroughs' it is perfectly evident that a County in the ordinary sense is not in view, but, as I said, a great city -- 'the metropolis of the Empire'.<a name=243:15></a> The word 'County' seems to be employed arbitrarily as applied to London, and so the word 'borough' -- they are out of proper setting; all was for convenience and obviously in nowise intended to render the metropolis of the empire as non-existent.<a name=243:16></a> I note that the <i>inner</i> city is said to be a <i>County of a City</i> (Britannica), so also the Corporation of Glasgow.<a name=243:17></a>

		As regards the word 'metropolis' it matters little who drew attention to 'Lord Halsbury's judgment;' a definition thus given cannot alter its primary and general meaning.<a name=243:18></a> Its generally accepted meaning is that which God would recognise, I am sure.<a name=243:19></a> The most elaborate dictionary I know of makes no allusion to the legal definition you mention.<a name=243:20></a> Of course, as other words, it may be used arbitrarily, as applies to the policy, for I understand the 'City' has its own police, and of course they too belong really to the metropolis -- the word used in its ordinary sense.<a name=243:21></a> As to Auckland in the quotation you give -- the words 'the same city' should be left out.<a name=243:22></a> What I stressed at the Conference of brothers there was that if there was any

		With you, I am sorry that there should be any disagreement between us and I earnestly trust it will not be for long duration.<a name=244:13></a> The best way to ensure this is to be frank, reserving nothing; each being assured that personal motives do not govern him and that while he is concerned for what is right and true, he is not overlooking the value of his brother.<a name=244:14></a> As you rightly say, we have been generally agreed in regard of the truth since we first met, 38 years ago, and I am sure we both wish this agreement to continue.<a name=244:15></a> You may be assured, therefore, that I am not disposed to take a biased view of your paper.<a name=244:16></a> But as it was to me new both in form and substance, I was bound to write freely, especially as you had desired me to do so.<a name=244:17></a> I shall now refer to the features of the subject seriatim as they appear in your letters.<a name=244:18></a>

		The powers that be, -- I have no doubt that you respect them, but your paper reiterated that the saints had nothing to do with them in regard of city boundaries and the like.<a name=245:1></a> This not only produces a bad impression on the mind, but it is obviously incorrect.<a name=245:2></a> If I own a house I must recognise the powers that be in the <i>name</i> of the place (city, town or village), the name of the street and the number of the house.<a name=245:3></a> If you write me a letter it will not reach me unless you comply with the ordering of the civil powers.<a name=245:4></a> The same applies to a room or hall in which the saints meet.<a name=245:5></a> I need not enlarge on this feature for it is quite evident that what I have said covers the limits or boundaries of places.<a name=245:6></a> I am to pay tribute to whom tribute is due, and so I must determine to whom my taxes are to be paid and this is by finding out that I am within the area of the authority to whom the tax is to be paid.<a name=245:7></a> In New York the obligation is on the property holder to find out the person to whom his taxes are to be paid; if he fails to pay he will be fined.<a name=245:8></a> Unless therefore you recognise the ordering of the civil powers, a communication mailed by you to the saints in New York will not reach them.<a name=245:9></a> The Lord Himself designates a street in Damascus and we are bound to accept that "Straight" was its name as given by the civil powers.<a name=245:10></a> And so when he told Saul to "<i>enter into</i> the city" he alluded not only to people, but to houses, walls, etc.<a name=245:11></a> The ethnarch kept the city of the Damascenes shut up to take Saul: the city and the people are distinct.<a name=245:12></a> Thus the assembly in Damascus would be the saints within the limits indicated in the word <i>enter</i> used by the Lord.<a name=245:13></a> To assume that the saints would not recognise those limits, is wholly inadmissible.<a name=245:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You mention the assembly in Philemon's house as showing that the conception of an assembly is not confined to the political boundaries of a city.<a name=245:15></a> I never thought it was, nor have I ever heard anyone say it was.<a name=245:16></a> The enquiry is not that but what is involved in the expression "The assembly of God .<a name=245:17></a>.<a name=245:18></a>.<a name=245:19></a> <i>in Corinth</i>" -- must not <i>Corinth</i> be determined?<a name=245:20></a> As you say, 'the assemblies in households would be embraced in the larger thought of the assembly in a city'.<a name=245:21></a>

		As regards the application of the term Son, or Son of God, to our Lord as "in the form of God", I have long hesitated about it, while not entertaining any anxiety as to those who had no difficulty as to such application, who indeed, like yourself, held it as a cardinal truth.<a name=260:6></a> They held, thus, His eternal personality and so there was nothing to fear on this head.<a name=260:7></a>

		First, as to <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#5">1 Thessalonians  5</a>, the article in Believers' Friend.<a name=262:19></a> I had not seen in MSS.<a name=262:20></a> R.<a name=262:21></a>B.<a name=262:22></a> must have revised it.<a name=262:23></a> But I always considered "sleep" in verse 10 to be death, as in chapter 4.<a name=262:24></a> I find J.<a name=262:25></a>N.<a name=262:26></a>D.<a name=262:27></a> so regards it -- Synopsis.<a name=262:28></a> No doubt your information is correct as to <i>kathendo</i>, although I note LXX has it in <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#2">Daniel  2</a>; but this is hardly an exception.<a name=262:29></a> At any rate, like our own word sleep, this and <i>koimaomai</i> strictly are used only in a figurative way of death.<a name=262:30></a> The context, it seems to me, of <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#5:10">1 Thessalonians  5:10</a> shows that death is meant, for I do not see how the apostle could use sleep in the sense in which the state or conduct of unbelievers is described earlier in the chapter.<a name=262:31></a> "Whether we may be watching or sleep, we may live together with him", seems, as it stands, to mean, whether we are watching -- as alive in the body -- or asleep in Jesus.<a name=262:32></a> Otherwise it would be 'whether we be watching or, like those of the night, in a state of insensibility to Christ and His things, we should live together with him'.<a name=262:33></a> This would treat lightly the very bad state alluded to.<a name=262:34></a> As I said, I cannot see that the apostle would thus speak.<a name=262:35></a> Mr.<a name=262:36></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But, of course, what we must rely on is the Scripture itself and the more I weigh it on this great matter the more I am unable to see the justness of applying the designation Son to our Lord as in "the <i>form</i> of God" -- before incarnation, I mean.<a name=263:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Your remark (in the leaflet) that the relationship was not made by the revelation is just as far as it goes, but what should be noted is that the Lord's Sonship in <i>manhood</i> existed <i>before</i> the revelation.<a name=263:26></a> It was of course, there from His birth, and Luke and Matthew formally recognise this, but the <i>announcement</i> of it was at His baptism.<a name=263:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As was said at the meetings, the great and blessed fact is His eternal distinct personality and the infinite glory of it -- <i>He was God</i>.<a name=263:28></a> We are all agreed as to this and there can be no admission of compromise or doubt as to it.<a name=263:29></a> The language of Scripture (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:1">John  1:1</a> - 3) is wonderfully plain and concise.<a name=263:30></a> The question then is, Does Scripture apply sonship to Him as in the <i>form</i> of God, or before He became flesh?<a name=263:31></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What is usually said is that God could not send or give a Son unless He had one.<a name=263:32></a> This is obviously true, but what underlies the remark is that the act, so to speak, of giving or
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=264>[Page 264]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		sending must be <i>before</i> incarnation, or that the incarnation was the expression of it.<a name=264:1></a> I am not prepared to deny or aver anything as to time definitely, but the matter should be weighed in a spiritual way.<a name=264:2></a> We might also, on the same ground, say that God must have had "Jesus Christ" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>) in order to send Him.<a name=264:3></a> No one will say that that designation applied to Him before incarnation.<a name=264:4></a> We have also, "Whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world".<a name=264:5></a> As far as I understand, J.<a name=264:6></a>N.<a name=264:7></a>D.<a name=264:8></a> connects sanctification there (<a href="../bible/John.htm#10">John  10</a>) with Him as <i>Man</i>.<a name=264:9></a> Anyway I am assured it should be.<a name=264:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It helps, I think, to bear in mind that revelation is for <i>finite</i> minds -- no man can take in the form of God -- and so sonship, being owned in Christ by the Father, conveys what He is personally; our minds can take this in, we can apprehend (not comprehend) <i>Who</i> He is thus, always bearing in mind that no one knows the Son but the Father.<a name=264:11></a> But the truth of His Person -- Who He is -- is in the soul as a solid rock.<a name=264:12></a> It is a term (I am only submitting this, seeking to be subject and cautious as on such holy ground) therefore, which, while applied to Him as in manhood only, asserts His deity; the <i>Person</i> is before the adoring believer (<a href="../bible/John.htm#9">John  9</a>) and known.<a name=264:13></a> We cannot compass Him, but we apprehend <i>Who</i> He is; He loves me in a known personal way, and I love Him.<a name=264:14></a> But, as I said, my finite mind is met; I can apprehend Sonship in a Man, but I do not pretend to apprehend it in One in the form of God.<a name=264:15></a> This is beyond the finite mind, it seems to me.<a name=264:16></a> The relationship of Son, or Son of God, in a Man is enough to denote His Person (a Person I can know and love) but what He is <i>in the Deity</i> is beyond my range.<a name=264:17></a> He dwells in light unapproachable, whom no man has seen nor can see.<a name=264:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus in John's gospel, where the truth of our Lord's Person is formally treated, Sonship is not mentioned <i>until He is said to have become flesh;</i> and then it is given as the conclusion arrived at by those who contemplated Him; they saw His glory as of an only-begotten with a Father.<a name=264:19></a> John the baptist's testimony is also on the ground of what he saw, and that of Nathanael.<a name=264:20></a> In verse 18 we have the formal statement of the Lord's Sonship by the Spirit, but this obviously also contemplates Him as Man; He <i>is</i> in the bosom of the Father.<a name=264:21></a> The preposition "in" (<i>eis</i>) as you will know, points to His <i>coming to</i> the position.<a name=264:22></a> This probably implies His personal worth or attractiveness as Man.<a name=264:23></a>

		As to giving and sending, while these are generally in the past tense, the greatness of the person given or sent is in view.<a name=265:1></a> Such terms as the "Word" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>) and "Jesus Christ" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>) and "Christ Jesus" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#1">1 Timothy  1</a>) have to be borne in mind as well as "the Son".<a name=265:2></a> Designations known and used, having come out in Christ become Man, are used to indicate His Person whether before or after incarnation.<a name=265:3></a> As I said, I do not see how we, as finite, can apprehend His Person save as we see what He is to and with God.<a name=265:4></a> What was seen was intelligible to man -- an only one, with <i>a</i> father.<a name=265:5></a>

		Beloved Brother, -- I thank you for your letter of the 25th ult.<a name=270:17></a>, being most interested in your remarks as to the great and precious subject of our Lord's sonship.<a name=270:18></a> I am drawn to your suggestion that such a passage as <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:5">John  17:5</a> had incarnation in view.<a name=270:19></a> I am assured that this applies to <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#8">Proverbs  8</a>; but I have connected <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:5">John  17:5</a> with chapter 1: 1.<a name=270:20></a> His personal distinctness is seen there and chapter 17 shows that love existed between divine Persons before incarnation and that there was a glory that One had "along with" Another.<a name=270:21></a> This, of course, we should assume, as knowing Them, even if the fact were not stated.<a name=270:22></a> The glory of verse 5 is, I suppose, what is termed 'Godhead glory'.<a name=270:23></a> He demands it now as Man, as having glorified the Father on the earth.<a name=270:24></a> Thus, while He remains Man, Godhead glory is ever seen in Him.<a name=270:25></a> It is very wonderful that He should take up what is a personal right (for He "was God") on the ground of having finished the work given Him to do on earth.<a name=270:26></a> Then (verse 24) He speaks of <i>given glory</i>, connecting it with the Father's <i>love</i> for Him before the foundation of the world.<a name=270:27></a> There is thus a blending of what He was and what He shared before the world (i.<a name=270:28></a>e.<a name=270:29></a> as in the form of God) with what He is and has as Man.<a name=270:30></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>is specially marked by this.<a name=270:31></a> As spoken in our hearing, as it were, we have the expression of the intimacy and affection which exist between divine Persons brought within the range of our apprehension, and as entering into our own relations with Them and with each other.<a name=270:32></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But while we are in this way allowed an insight into the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=271>[Page 271]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		relations of divine Persons, it is necessarily limited to our finite conception.<a name=271:1></a> If we think of the Person loved or glorified it is One now in manhood; and if we think of the One who loved Him it is <i>His</i> Father -- that is, all hinges on incarnation.<a name=271:2></a> That they were ever distinct Persons is cardinal truth, but Their form, how They loved Each Other, communicated with each Other, what Their designations, if any -- all is beyond us, it seems to me.<a name=271:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to <a href="../bible/John.htm#16:28">John  16:28</a>, I understand it as in keeping with this gospel in a general way.<a name=271:4></a> Much is made of His coming or being sent from God or coming or being sent from the Father and going to Him, or of coming from heaven.<a name=271:5></a> The Persons are in view, but already known by the designations used.<a name=271:6></a> In chapter 16: 28 there is a double action in both cases -- coming out from ("from with") and coming into, and <i>leaving</i> and <i>going to</i>.<a name=271:7></a> The former would be incarnation and then taking up a position in public testimony -- at His baptism; the latter His giving up the public position (as indeed He had done in chapter 12), and His ascension.<a name=271:8></a> Coming from the Father cannot be said to imply that that <i>term of relationship</i> existed before the incarnation, any more than that "Jesus Christ" applied before.<a name=271:9></a> This, at least, is my understanding of the matter.<a name=271:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We shall be thinking of you in view of the cold weather coming.<a name=271:11></a> I can understand how <i>so many</i> visitors try you.<a name=271:12></a> Receiving <i>all</i> who come to you, preaching the kingdom of God and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ involves plenty of work!<a name=271:13></a> That the Lord may continue to help you in this great service is our continual prayer.<a name=271:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		of <i>my</i> spirit as something characterising me or a <i>feature</i> of myself, but Scripture also regards the spirit as the man himself; that is, his real self, what he is inwardly, eternally, what he is in relation to God.<a name=272:1></a> The spirit, in contrast to the material, returns to God who gave it.<a name=272:2></a> Thus the saint, while in falling asleep he commits his spirit to the Lord Jesus, or asks Him to receive it, departs to be with Him -- the person goes.<a name=272:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		All this bears on our Lord's incarnation.<a name=272:4></a> Becoming Man <i>He</i> was really Man.<a name=272:5></a> His <i>Person</i> was unchanged.<a name=272:6></a> His spirit was Himself.<a name=272:7></a> He commits it to His Father.<a name=272:8></a> He had become a Man and was in man's place and so committed Himself to His Father.<a name=272:9></a> He had just said to the thief, "To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#23:43">Luke  23:43</a>).<a name=272:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Scripture presents facts so that our finite minds can take them in and I am sure our wisdom is to take them simply as presented and the Holy Spirit gives us understanding or apprehension in keeping with our limitations.<a name=272:11></a> We thus see a blessed Man committing His spirit, as about to die, to His Father and we know He refers to Himself -- what He was inwardly; His body would be separate for a moment.<a name=272:12></a> We adore, bearing in mind <i>Who</i> was there, the <i>whole</i> truth being inscrutable.<a name=272:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Matthew and Luke give us the maternal side to establish the reality of His humanity -- He came of a woman, but John says "The Word became flesh" -- One who was God, taking human condition.<a name=272:14></a> It is thus Himself, whether He speaks of His spirit or His soul.<a name=272:15></a> F.<a name=272:16></a>E.<a name=272:17></a>R.<a name=272:18></a>'s opponents had in mind that there was a human <i>being</i>, spirit, soul and body, and <i>besides</i> a divine Being; that is, a dual personality (more accurately two Persons inwardly), one <i>merely</i> human and the other Divine.<a name=272:19></a> This is manifestly false.<a name=272:20></a>

		As regards names or titles of divine Persons, if I understood aright, you are correct in saying that they belong to the declaration or revelation of God -- Scripture does not warrant us in applying them as if borne by the Persons of the Godhead <i>before</i> the incarnation of our Lord.<a name=274:11></a> That the Persons ever existed as distinct, and that there were affections, etc.<a name=274:12></a>, proper to Them, is plainly stated and fundamental truth that cannot, must not, be beclouded.<a name=274:13></a> In revelation God has graciously come out to us in names and relationships that we can understand, all bearing on the incarnation of Christ.<a name=274:14></a> But when we think or speak of the relations of Divine Persons as in the Godhead I am sure we should hesitate, bowing our hearts in the presence of what we cannot comprehend.<a name=274:15></a> But the Infinite has come within the range of the finite in the Word becoming flesh.<a name=274:16></a> A lonely Man among men is known and loved and worshipped; and God in Him, so that he who has seen Him has seen the Father.<a name=274:17></a> Of course revelation <i>is</i> revelation -- it is of God as to His nature and attributes, but so as to be intelligible to His creatures, that is, in the Son as Man; but God as to

		Beloved Brother, -- I was very glad to receive your letter of December 17th and I should have replied earlier had I not been away from New York.<a name=276:17></a> Last week I returned from a somewhat extended trip, having gone as far as the Pacific Coast.<a name=276:18></a> The journeying caused much fatigue, but the seasons with the dear saints most refreshing.<a name=276:19></a> The meetings are few on the West Coast but the quality good.<a name=276:20></a> There were four days of meetings at Los Angeles and much help from the Lord.<a name=276:21></a> There is a very interesting work there.<a name=276:22></a> Los Angeles is now one of the 'famous cities' of the world and God is graciously placing a testimony there.<a name=276:23></a> The same may be said of San Francisco, of which Berkeley, where the meeting is, is a suburb.<a name=276:24></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not know that I can say anything to help you on the subject you mention beyond what you have read in the Notes you mention.<a name=277:24></a> I take the use of the word "world" to be <i>somewhat</i> abstract in <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:16">John  3:16</a>, that is, that it alludes to what God created formed and ornamented, man being set in it and over it, or as ordered later with Israel as its centre.<a name=277:25></a> The first mention of it in John's gospel (especially chapter 1: 10) includes the former -- it had its being through Christ.<a name=277:26></a> "The world knew him not:" this would allude to persons, but persons in and of the system, including the material order of things, that began to be through Christ.<a name=277:27></a> Literally what the Lord met was what existed in Israel, Jerusalem, Galilee, etc.<a name=277:28></a> -- but the whole created sphere in which men were was involved.<a name=277:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It seems to me that this has to be borne in mind in treating of <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:16">John  3:16</a>.<a name=277:30></a> I have no difficulty in admitting that it is 'the world that then was' from this point of view.<a name=277:31></a> Thus it would be the world of <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>- 2 or what was set up later in relation to Israel (<a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#32:8">Deuteronomy  32:8</a>).<a name=277:32></a> <a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#31:9">Ezekiel  31:9</a> has this latter in view.<a name=277:33></a>

		But while all this underlies <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:16">John  3:16</a>, and while it is somewhat abstract, as I said, what is emphasised is the <i>universal:</i> that <i>all</i> were in view and not the Jews only.<a name=278:1></a> "World" therefore is subordinate to "whosoever".<a name=278:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In presenting the Person of Christ the Holy Spirit begins with designations applying to Him <i>as Man</i>, such as the Son, the Word, Wisdom, etc.<a name=280:19></a>, but this is far from saying that these applied to Him as in the form of God.<a name=280:20></a> In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#9:5">Romans  9:5</a> "Christ" is said to exist God over all, but clearly we cannot say that that term always applied in that existence.<a name=280:21></a> It implies that He is anointed and so takes a place below proper Deity.<a name=280:22></a> The same remarks cover the designation Son.<a name=280:23></a> Although there is the clearest evidence that it indicates His personal deity, yet He says, "The Son can do nothing of Himself", and that no one knows that hour, "nor the Son" -- these statements do not convey Deity but rather that One who has, as to His Person, part in it has taken a relatively inferior position to carry out the will of God.<a name=280:24></a> This is as clear as anything in Scripture and so to make terms which convey this latter apply to or characterise the Person as in the form of God is unscriptural.<a name=280:25></a>

		I quite agree that the dealing with sin by the people of God should have a public <i>bearing;</i> all who might be interested should know that the great principle of judging evil is maintained.<a name=282:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In detail, however, this, the mode of procedure, would be regulated by wisdom.<a name=282:18></a> If a special meeting is called, as you mention, of course, only those in fellowship -- those breaking bread -- would be present.<a name=282:19></a> I cannot see how 'any professing Christian in the place could rightly claim to be there'.<a name=282:20></a> If such persons are disregarding Christian fellowship, expressed in the Lord's supper, how can they 'rightfully' claim to have part in discipline?<a name=282:21></a> If identified with current religious denominations, or otherwise worldly, they are under discipline themselves in principle, for those who are seeking to keep the commandments of the Lord, naming His Name, in the town or place have withdrawn from them (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2">2 Timothy  2</a>).<a name=282:22></a> "Ye and my spirit being gathered together, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5:4">1 Corinthians  5:4</a>) -- "Ye" corresponds with those

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If the meeting for discipline takes place after a prayer or reading meeting and interested or exercised persons are present at the latter, it would be right to let them remain <i>perhaps</i>, so that they might see that holiness is maintained, although unless they are clear themselves it is not right that they should have <i>part</i> in the discipline.<a name=283:2></a> As far as I know brethren are enabled of the Lord to act wisely in these matters.<a name=283:3></a> They are indeed the children of wisdom.<a name=283:4></a>

		Beloved Brother, -- I am very glad of a line from you and what you write as to the 'box' rather commends itself to me; it certainly should not be made to appear as <i>part</i> of the Lord's supper.<a name=287:35></a> Thus if, as you suggest, it is placed by itself on the table -- that is, at a distance considerably greater than that separating the bread and cup -- the Supper would retain its own distinctness and the box would be in <i>seemly</i> evidence, denoting our practical response to what is divinely presented in the 'emblems'.<a name=287:36></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards <a href="..\hymns\hymns1972.htm#172:3">Hymn 172</a>, verse 3, I quite follow your objection, but the lines you note are clearly based on <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3">Philippians  3</a>, and while the apostle mentions certain things which, on account of Christ, he counted loss, in verse 8 he says, "Surely I count
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=288>[Page 288]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		also all things to be loss".<a name=288:1></a> Of course "things" cannot be said to include 'persons' and therefore not one's wife and children.<a name=288:2></a> 'The dearest object of our love' would include persons and so is not literally right; that is, if we view the matter purely from the standpoint of the wilderness.<a name=288:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is another viewpoint -- that of new creation.<a name=288:4></a> "In Christ Jesus" there is no male or female.<a name=288:5></a> And has not <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#14:26">Luke  14:26</a> to be read in the light of this?<a name=288:6></a> Philippians 3 would be on the same line, the apostle having the <i>full</i> thought of God for him in view; and so elsewhere he says, "we henceforth know no one according to flesh".<a name=288:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What has to be owned therefore is that Philippians 3 implies a spiritual stature and energy far beyond most, if not all, today, and so we are shut up to the necessity of taking it up in an <i>abstract</i> way.<a name=288:8></a> This is warranted; indeed otherwise there is <i>much</i> which we should be obliged to avoid either singing or saying.<a name=288:9></a> While we cannot regard persons -- believing wives, etc.<a name=288:10></a> -- as loss or dross, natural relationships, in the sense of what they afford, may be so regarded as <i>compared with Christ</i>.<a name=288:11></a> It is a question of appraisement, Christ in glory being the standard.<a name=288:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		No doubt the writer of the hymn did not include persons (Christians) in 'dross', but literally they cannot be excluded as 'objects' of love, and so the line should be altered, as you say.<a name=288:13></a> As applying to things attaching to us in the flesh, in which we would live naturally, the line could be sung, however.<a name=288:14></a> Please God, I shall mention your remarks as the hymn is considered.<a name=288:15></a>

		conveys a principle governing such a position as Bexley Heath.<a name=289:1></a> It has been so used in several cases and the Lord has confirmed the application of the principle of proximity.<a name=289:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What has to be borne in mind is that fellowship is general as well as local, hence when a division occurs in a meeting, fellowship in the former sense is involved, and so <i>in principle</i> all have to say to it.<a name=289:3></a> "Thine elders and thy judges" (verse 2) implies this for those of Israel are in view.<a name=289:4></a> In agreement with this, saints generally today would wisely leave a matter such as Bexley Heath in the hands of the meeting or meetings nearest.<a name=289:5></a> The fact that <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#21">Deuteronomy  21</a>deals also with the establishment of guilt or innocency in the nearby city, does not invalidate the principle of proximity.<a name=289:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The most important feature in the chapter is the priests.<a name=289:7></a> These refer to spirituality (ability to judge), and if this does not exist in a meetings confidence by saints elsewhere could not wisely (believers characteristically are wisdom's children) be placed in it, and so its nearness to the scene of trouble would fail of importance; hence meetings further afield, in which there is spiritual ability to judge, would be responsible to take part in the matter.<a name=289:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus the procedure would be on a moral basis, the work of God in His people being taken into account.<a name=289:9></a> The position would be one of general fellowship, into which the adjustment of the saints necessarily enters.<a name=289:10></a> Thus wisdom would leave the adjustment of the case with the nearest meeting or meetings, being assured of sufficient priestly integrity and ability existing in it or them to form a godly judgment.<a name=289:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is exactly what marked the handling of the Bexley Heath case.<a name=289:12></a> There was general confidence in Sidcup, and this was strengthened by other nearby meetings confirming what Sidcup did.<a name=289:13></a>

		The first and chief fact to be noted in this Columbus matter is that it is occasioned by a request for fellowship in their breaking bread there, addressed to the nearest meetings, by a few saints resident in that city.<a name=293:18></a> Should this be granted or not?<a name=293:19></a> Who should immediately say?<a name=293:20></a> It is a matter which <i>in principle</i> concerns all, but <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#21">Deuteronomy  21</a>plainly indicates that it lies with the nearest meeting (or meetings, so as to assure confidence, if it does not appear there is sufficient priestly discernment and intelligence in the one), and this way has been universally recognised among the saints, and the Lord has very definitely owned it.<a name=293:21></a> Why should it be disregarded in the present case?<a name=293:22></a> The brethren who met at Chicago, as your letter states, 'Attached first importance to the Chicago meeting being free to commend the movement to the meetings nearest to Columbus -- they being responsible in the first part for the commendation of the brethren at Michigan City to the brethren generally'.<a name=293:23></a> There is no scriptural principle or precedent for a meeting or assembly commending another meeting to other meetings.<a name=293:24></a> The Lord's rights in the midst of "two or three" would be disregarded in such an action.<a name=293:25></a> To say that the few at Columbus cannot be regarded in this light would be very wrong.<a name=293:26></a> Severally they have been in happy fellowship with saints generally, and as loving the Lord He would own and help them in seeking to remember Him as He requested and to maintain His interests where they

		reside.<a name=294:1></a> Fellowship formally extended to them only recognises what is there.<a name=294:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But if it be said that Chicago should commend them as individuals (your letters says, 'the movement', which would be collective) this also would be unscriptural, for there was a recognised meeting at Michigan City before most of those who had resided there moved to Columbus, and any commendation should be by it.<a name=294:3></a> Besides, some of the few at Columbus never lived at Michigan City or near Chicago, and thus why should Chicago commend them?<a name=294:4></a> The company at Columbus is composed of some who resided there for years, as I said, others who had lived at Indianapolis, but more recently at Michigan City, and who moved to Columbus some time ago, others who lived regularly at Michigan City, but moved to Columbus also some time ago, and others who moved quite recently from Michigan City.<a name=294:5></a> That it should be made of first importance that a meeting much further away than three or four others should commend this company to the 'meeting nearest' is certainly a novelty.<a name=294:6></a> But it is far worse, it would involve the overthrow of the economy of the assembly, this being connected with companies in localities, each (while in one fellowship) being responsible to the Lord; the local principle widening out as necessity requires, as in the present case, but never leaping over those who should, as near, take up responsibility as neighbours.<a name=294:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The idea of a <i>meeting</i> moving from one city to another is inadmissible -- it would be a meeting on wheels for a time, which would negate the local feature which Scripture requires; besides, it could not be said of the company at Columbus, for, as I said, some of them never lived at Michigan City.<a name=294:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The brethren meeting at Chicago to consider this matter have no status warranting them to pronounce on conditions existing at Columbus.<a name=294:9></a> They could, of course, take counsel as to the truth or principles governing such a position, but judgment as to conduct of any at Columbus should be left with the company at Columbus.<a name=294:10></a> Or if it were evident that it could not be dealt with there it should lie with the nearest meeting, according to the principle of "his neighbour next unto his house" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#12:4">Exodus  12:4</a>), or the "city that is nearest", (<a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#21:3">Deuteronomy  21:3</a>).<a name=294:11></a> To attach any disciplinary authority to such a meeting as was held at Chicago would soon destroy the local principle established in Scripture and land the saints into metropolitanism

		<a name=295>[Page 295]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		or the principle of a general assembly.<a name=295:1></a> What you say happened at Chicago is of this kind; 'It was quite understood that the brethren at Chicago had expressed themselves that no encouragement should be given to them (the H------ s) to move about', etc.<a name=295:2></a> That brethren (who in this case hitherto enjoyed the fellowship in confidence of saints generally) should be thus disciplined by brethren representing several meetings and resident for the most part far away from their own locality, is a wrong done to them, and highly objectionable to any sensitive mind having a knowledge of the economy of the assembly.<a name=295:3></a> It is, as I said, metropolitanism.<a name=295:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The meeting which existed at Michigan City had an assembly status equal to that at Chicago or any other, and so while it continued, any leaving Michigan City for another place would of course be commended by it.<a name=295:5></a> For a brother or sister in these circumstances to ask for a letter of commendation from Chicago would be out of order; and then having moved to another place his or her local responsibility would be there, and not in the place vacated.<a name=295:6></a> Thus the local responsibility of all those now residing in Columbus is in Columbus.<a name=295:7></a> The Lord will support and bless them there as they are subject to Him, and He will order the extension of fellowship to them (through the neighbouring meeting, as it is subject to His will) in due course.<a name=295:8></a>

		As a matter of fact it is doubtful that the conduct of any of us would bear such an unscriptural and consequently unspiritual examination as Mr.<a name=296:13></a> H------'s was submitted to.<a name=296:14></a> The notice shows that the testimony of one witness was accepted, e.<a name=296:15></a>g.<a name=296:16></a> that of Mr.<a name=296:17></a> J------.<a name=296:18></a> If, for instance, your movement from Toronto to London, including your history and relations in the former city, was investigated in <i>this</i> way at that time you would object, I am sure.<a name=296:19></a> Suppose the investigation was by '40 brothers from 12 different meetings met together' at Hamilton, the brethren there having been adverse to you.<a name=296:20></a> It would be wrong (because of the composition of the enquiry meeting and the locality) even at Toronto.<a name=296:21></a> In the present case the error is worse, for Mr.<a name=296:22></a> H------ had not left Chicago, not having lived there, but in Michigan City.<a name=296:23></a>

		The Chicago letter states that 'the brethren from Indianapolis and Cincinnati desired the judgment of their brethren from other parts in regard to what is right in relation to Columbus; consequently 40 brothers from 12 meetings met together'.<a name=298:7></a> Thus, we have a meeting called in Chicago to judge of matters relative to saints in Columbus, a city hundreds of miles away, and this meeting composed of brothers from many gatherings, some of which are thousands of miles away from the place concerning which enquiry is to be made and judgment to be passed!<a name=298:8></a> The number of meetings is mentioned, as if this added weight, whereas in truth if all the meetings in the world were represented, this would only add to the error.<a name=298:9></a> It would be a 'general council' such as Rome would convene.<a name=298:10></a> This is not warranted by Scripture, on the contrary these councils from an early date obliterated the status of the local assembly as taught in <a href="../bible/1and.htm#2">1 and  2</a>Corinthians, which I have mentioned.<a name=298:11></a> It will be serious indeed if this heritage, which the Lord has restored to His people, should again become lost.<a name=298:12></a> His place and authority in the midst of two or three gathered to His name would thus cease.<a name=298:13></a>

		As I have already said in relation to <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>, counsel may rightly be sought where needed from any brother or brothers capable by wisdom or experience of giving it, but this is an entirely different matter from a lot of brothers from different localities 'met together' to arrive at a 'judgment' as to matters <i>local</i>, especially when local to another city.<a name=298:14></a> Besides, any counsel obtained from brothers supposed competent

		The meeting at Chicago is said to have reached 'a judgment' which according to the information I have in addition to the Chicago letter, is of a piece with the composition and assumed status of the meeting -- it has not scriptural support.<a name=299:2></a> Mr.<a name=299:3></a> D------ who attended the meetings held, writes me as follows 'The brethren representing several meetings at Chicago attached first importance to the Chicago meeting being free to commend the movement to the meetings nearest to Columbus, they being responsible in the first part for the commendation of the brethren at Michigan City to the brethren generally'.<a name=299:4></a> This is in keeping with Mr.<a name=299:5></a>------'s judgment conveyed in a letter to Mr.<a name=299:6></a> H------ before he went to Chicago.<a name=299:7></a> The Chicago letter does not go so far, but nevertheless records the unscriptural feature, that a meeting being near can recommend another meeting to other meetings or 'brethren generally' and that having done so it retains a certain sponsorship for it which the latter has to recognise.<a name=299:8></a> All this is a human way of viewing and dealing with the things of God, having no scriptural sanction; indeed Scripture is not appealed to in this letter.<a name=299:9></a> The idea entering into a company of saints beginning to break bread in a place, answering the Lord's request, is that brethren in the nearest meeting recognise that the features of the assembly are there (however small and feeble) and so extend fellowship.<a name=299:10></a> Normally, all other meetings accept this and so "keep the unity of the Spirit".<a name=299:11></a> One assembly assuming oversight or sponsorship over another, in however little a degree, to this extent disregards the Lord's place and rights in the latter.<a name=299:12></a>

		You will understand that I am not entering into the wisdom (according to records Chicago was notified of the intended move to Columbus) or unwisdom of what was done at Michigan City; these are matters which brethren at Cincinnati and Columbus will no doubt enquire into in due course; I am concerned about the divine principles that were disregarded at Chicago and that the brethren at Cincinnati may be helped as waiting on God in the responsibility as to Columbus that under Him has come to them.<a name=299:13></a> Our testimony largely lies in adhering to what is 'written', in being governed by the light intended by God for our guidance in any position or service to which we may be called.<a name=299:14></a>

		My Dear Brother, -- What I have seen in answer to the request for fellowship by the saints at Columbus fixes attention almost entirely on Mr.<a name=300:10></a> H------ and the evident idea of a company of saints seeking to walk together in Christian fellowship is overlooked.<a name=300:11></a> Even though the proposed time set for the breaking of bread did not afford as much time for consideration as some thought necessary, a brotherly word of counsel to wait with the assurance that inquiry would be at once made by those immediately responsible (those in the nearest meeting) would have shown a shepherd spirit.<a name=300:12></a> It may be said that this was done, but was it?<a name=300:13></a> I believe I have accurate information, and from it I learn that there has been no inquiry made yet <i>at Columbus</i>, where it should be made according to Scripture (see the emphasis on "<i>his</i> city" in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#21:18">Deuteronomy  21:18</a> - 21).<a name=300:14></a> The matter was surely important, involving something for Christ, and if it was inconvenient for brothers near to go to Columbus immediately, they could at least make clear that they <i>would go</i>.<a name=300:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Instead of this, inquiry was made <i>in Chicago</i>, where it should <i>not</i> be made, that city being farther away than four others where meetings are.<a name=300:16></a> This led to meetings being held in Chicago composed of '40 brothers from 12 different meetings' to form a judgment as to Columbus.<a name=300:17></a> The inquiry involved accusations made against a brother in Columbus and a 'judgment' reached, this 'judgment', being signed by four brothers as addressed to the brother in question (Mr.<a name=300:18></a> H------ ) and sent to him at Columbus.<a name=300:19></a> In this there was disregard of the principle clearly set out in the passage quoted; the "rebellious son" (which expression is somewhat in keeping with what some in Chicago said of Mr.<a name=300:20></a> H------ !<a name=300:21></a>) is brought "unto the elders of <i>his</i> city, and unto the gate of <i>his</i> place".<a name=300:22></a> Note, it is not their -- the parents' -- city.<a name=300:23></a> Those responsible for those

		My Dear Mr------, -- Last week the thought arose in my mind that I should call and see you as to matters relative to Chicago and Columbus and I took counsel as to this, but the way did not seem clear, your health entering into this; but I am pressed to send you a line and to enclose with it some papers to indicate to you my grave concern as to this matter, especially the proceedings at Chicago.<a name=302:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In view of the seriousness of it, your part in what has transpired, and in view of our long acquaintance and identification, in large measure, in the testimony and service of our Lord, I feel it would be unbrotherly not to communicate with you in an open, frank way; with the hope, too, that my doing so may tend to defeat the current purpose of the common enemy.<a name=302:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is no need for me to add much to this as the copies of letters I am sending will convey to you my mind on the salient features of the matter.<a name=302:6></a> But I do earnestly beg of you to weigh the scriptures the letters bring forward; perhaps having done so you may be able to take out of the enemy's hand the great advantage he has in the result of those meetings held in Chicago in relation to Columbus.<a name=302:7></a> These meetings, being contrary to the scriptural principles that should govern us in such circumstances, afford him means of damaging the Lord's interests -- His rights in the midst of two or three gathered to His name -- and any effort to defeat this will be pleasing to Him.<a name=302:8></a> What I write is not a question of <i>my</i> judgment as to an obscure case; what is involved is not obscure, the principle set out in the letters I enclose is as plainly and fully established and 'believed among us' as any truth I know of.<a name=302:9></a> The 'Glanton' conflict greatly helped to this end; God by His spirit made the rights of Christ in local gatherings clear then and He has been emphasising and confirming this feature ever since.<a name=302:10></a> The teaching of the Old Testament has greatly helped in this as amplifying the teaching of the Corinthian letters.<a name=302:11></a> There has been a constant effort to minimise the authority of the Old Testament, but the Lord says, "If ye do not believe his [Moses'] writings, how shall ye believe my words?<a name=302:12></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus if Mr.<a name=302:13></a> H------'s conduct be even as bad as anyone might wish to make it, <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#21:18">Deuteronomy  21:18</a> - 21 teaches that inquiry into it and a 'judgment' reached should not be in

		My Dear Brother, -- What pressed upon my mind in reading your letter of the 19th inst.<a name=305:10></a> was priesthood -- how essential it is to a right understanding and treatment of the request of our brethren at Columbus for the fellowship of their brethren in their breaking bread there.<a name=305:11></a> It is obviously dependent on the features of the assembly, however small, existing among them.<a name=305:12></a> This requires priestly or spiritual discernment, and for this diligent enquiry should be made <i>in the place</i>.<a name=305:13></a> See <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#14:33">Leviticus  14:33</a> - 48 for this principle of careful local enquiry.<a name=305:14></a> In <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#21">Deuteronomy  21</a>, where every controversy and stroke are to be at their word, the priests are said to be chosen of Jehovah to <i>bless</i> in His name.<a name=305:15></a> Malachi says, "The law of truth was in his mouth", and that the priest's lips should keep knowledge and the law should be sought at his mouth.<a name=305:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Your brethren who are concerned as to Columbus are enquiring whether these priestly features exist at Cincinnati.<a name=305:17></a> All are agreed as to proximity, but priesthood there is not clear, and this being lacking there can be no expectation of the mind of God coming through you.<a name=305:18></a> The wide detour to Chicago (I do not, of course, refer to the general fellowship meetings there) and the participation in a council of '40 brothers from 12 different meetings' met together there to judge of a matter at your doors was disregard of the law governing the position which true priests would insist on.<a name=305:19></a> The 'judgment' reached was not even sent to Columbus through you, but direct.<a name=305:20></a> You say the word 'judgment' should not have been used in the Chicago letter to Columbus, but those not present at the meetings are bound to accept what is formally stated by four

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You own that 'the number as gathered together (at Chicago) was quite large', but that this was evidently in accord with <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#11:14">Proverbs  11:14</a>, 15, etc.<a name=306:3></a> The same could be conveniently said for the different church councils, to which I referred in my previous letter, but it is making use of one scripture to overthrow another.<a name=306:4></a> There is indeed safety in a multitude of counsellors <i>as regulated by Scripture</i>, but the very opposite is the case where they are not, which has proved to be so in this instance, as ------'s full acknowledgement with other evidences shows.<a name=306:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is true that Chicago as the nearest meeting, had a certain responsibility as to Michigan City, while the meeting existed there, as Michigan City had as to Chicago, if anything compromising general fellowship arose; but the discontinuance of a meeting, in itself, is no breach of fellowship.<a name=306:6></a> I know of many instances of this, saints moving to other places, and I know of a meeting ceasing in a town, the same persons forming as a meeting in another town, and no one thought of transgression on the part of the persons involved.<a name=306:7></a> The information furnished to brethren generally, including Chicago, as to the movement from Michigan City, was fuller and wider than any I have ever seen of such a matter.<a name=306:8></a> This was a considerable time, too, before the final move, and yet no complaint (that I know of) was made until a request for fellowship was made at Columbus.<a name=306:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The responsibility of the nearest meeting to Columbus is now to determine whether conditions warranting Christian fellowship exist there, and if so to extend it; there is no option if the conditions exist.<a name=306:10></a> Making this recognition depend on Chicago being 'happy' will not carry a priestly conscience.<a name=306:11></a> Chicago should not take this ground; if brethren there know of conduct of any at Columbus involving fellowship they can prove it in a 'lawful assembly', that is, at Columbus (<a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#21:18">Deuteronomy  21:18</a> - 21).<a name=306:12></a> Their doing this cannot but be viewed in an unfavourable light by those who soberly weigh the facts of the relations between Chicago and Michigan City for some years past.<a name=306:13></a> Certain at Chicago had adverse feelings against certain at Michigan City, and last winter a meeting was held by brothers involved in both meetings, Mr.<a name=306:14></a> Gill being present.<a name=306:15></a> I saw a letter from him afterwards in which he stated that those from

		Chicago had no case, or words to this effect.<a name=307:1></a> I also saw a letter from my brother to Mr.<a name=307:2></a> H------ also written shortly after, in which, in the friendliest terms, he reported that he had said to the brothers who had attended the above meeting, as all were returning to Chicago, that it was time they should stop talking about their brethren at Michigan City and start visiting them.<a name=307:3></a> He followed this up by a very friendly visit for a Lord's Day, a good few others accompanying him.<a name=307:4></a> Thus the difficulty seemed settled, and now it has flared up again.<a name=307:5></a> I mention all this, not to show that Mr.<a name=307:6></a> H------ was entirely justified in regard of this old sore or that the others were wrong, but as necessarily entering into the 'unhappiness' of Chicago and of its value as weighed in the balances of the sanctuary.<a name=307:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		My letter is longer than intended, but I am very concerned before the Lord that the position of Columbus should be clarified -- that those immediately responsible to see to it may "see all things clearly".<a name=307:8></a> Their concern as priests, as I already said, will be not only to abide by the "law" but to make it effective and in this to minister to God and <i>bless</i> in His Name.<a name=307:9></a> That He may help you all in this will be my constant prayer.<a name=307:10></a>

		My Dear Brother.<a name=308:25></a> -- I am thankful you were free to answer my letter of the 15th ultimo, yours of the 3rd instant having come last evening.<a name=308:26></a> As you have kindly written in numbered sections, I can reply the more easily and I shall do so as nearly as possibly seriatim.<a name=308:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First: You say as to <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#21">Deuteronomy  21</a>and <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#12">Exodus  12</a>that you believe 'we' (the brethren who met at the enquiry meetings at Chicago as I understand) 'acted upon' them, in proof of this saying, 'we believe that we at Chicago were the neighbour to Michigan City'.<a name=308:28></a> The occasion of the meetings, as your letter of January 5th states, was a desire for the 'judgment' of brethren on the part of some from Indianapolis
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and Cincinnati regarding <i>Columbus</i>, your being neighbour to Michigan City was therefore irrelevant.<a name=309:1></a> That <i>some</i> now in Columbus <i>had</i> resided in Michigan City cannot be made to weaken this, however much may be said as to what these should or should not have done.<a name=309:2></a> Brethren are now obliged to judge of all these matters as before God, and must "judge righteous judgment" as the Lord enjoins.<a name=309:3></a> To this end what does not directly bear on any point must in faithfulness be ruled out.<a name=309:4></a> I am sure you will own this as right and fair.<a name=309:5></a> Thus Chicago was <i>not</i> observing the scriptures quoted in coming together to judge of matters belonging to a locality to which four meetings are nearer than it.<a name=309:6></a> Nor did my brother recognise the above scriptures when he telephoned to a brother in Columbus that Chicago 'was not happy' that the breaking of bread should begin there; that he did this without furnishing reasons was arbitrary and disregardful of local responsibility.<a name=309:7></a> If information such as should prevent the breaking of bread was in his possession, this should be placed in proper, that is, local hands, and the Lord trusted to look after His interests.<a name=309:8></a> Apparent modifying occurrences cannot be admitted for two wrongs cannot make one right.<a name=309:9></a> At the brother's meeting this with other 'actions' of Chicago were viewed approvingly as paragraph 3 of Chicago letter states, the unscripturalness of the one I mention being clearly disregarded.<a name=309:10></a> Incidentally this also shows that the principle of judging existed at the said meetings and not merely the furnishing of counsel.<a name=309:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Second: What you remark as to the word 'judgment' does not at all show that it was misused in your letter; the whole document is pervaded by the thought of it.<a name=309:12></a> You quote <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#7:40">1 Corinthians  7:40</a>, but <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#15">Acts  15</a>, which you appeal to in paragraph 3, is more fitting.<a name=309:13></a> The proceedings at Jerusalem were of the nature of an apostolic metropolitan council and could be permissible only under the then transitional circumstances; besides doctrine was considered and not local assembly matters.<a name=309:14></a> There are, of course, principles in the chapter which we may follow, such as brethren coming together locally to consider a matter and the assembly carrying a decision into effect, but the principle of a general or metropolitan assembly as applied since is false and destructive of <a href="../bible/1and.htm#2">1 and  2</a>Corinthians as shown in church history.<a name=309:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the word 'judgment', you will find in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#15">Acts  15</a>what corresponds with the proceedings at Chicago much more

		accurately than <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#7">1 Corinthians  7</a>.<a name=310:1></a> James says (verse 19), "I judge", etc.<a name=310:2></a>, then what he formulated was embodied in a letter by the apostles and elders with the whole assembly, "having arrived at a common judgment".<a name=310:3></a> Making due allowance for the great differences in persons, etc.<a name=310:4></a>, this is what happened at Chicago.<a name=310:5></a> Mr.<a name=310:6></a>------ indicated the judgment, reading his letter to Mr.<a name=310:7></a> H------ of December 24th in the final (I understand there were three meetings) meeting and this was embodied in the letter of January 5th and <i>sent to the saints at Columbus</i>.<a name=310:8></a> The evidence of all this is Chicago's letter, Mr.<a name=310:9></a> D------'s letters to me, and Mr.<a name=310:10></a>------'s personal account to me.<a name=310:11></a> As regards <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#7:40">1 Corinthians  7:40</a>, Paul's "judgment" <i>was</i> such and would be so regarded by a faithful heart.<a name=310:12></a> If applied to such a case as Columbus it would be brethren there or at Cincinnati taking the considered opinion or judgment of a brother or brothers capable of giving it, to the Lord and having it verified locally.<a name=310:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Third: You say, 'I have been in two such meetings with you'.<a name=310:14></a> Pardon me, I must deny this, for I have not attended such meetings as are indicated in the Chicago letter and other testimony.<a name=310:15></a> Such occasions have to be regarded in the light of what passes in them, and the full information available shows most plainly that while counsel was sought and given (some of which was good, but the main part withdrawn later by the giver as wrong) the Chicago meetings, composed of 'forty brothers from twelve different meetings', entered into conduct and relations of saints in a city far away, sending also a formal judgment directly to these saints.<a name=310:16></a> No, dear brother, you did not attend such meetings with me.<a name=310:17></a> You enquire if <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#11:14">Proverbs  11:14</a>, 15 does not apply.<a name=310:18></a> This scripture cannot be made to overthrow other scriptures, such as those already quoted.<a name=310:19></a> It could be conveniently used thus to support a general council, which would set aside <a href="../bible/1and.htm#2">1 and  2</a>Corinthians and many other scriptures.<a name=310:20></a> The scripture in Proverbs 11 is most valuable in local care meetings and often comforts us here.<a name=310:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Fifth: 'Our letter says nothing about representation as you say'.<a name=310:22></a> I do not find that I say it does.<a name=310:23></a> I remark, 'If all the meetings in the world were represented' -- an independent statement.<a name=310:24></a> But Mr.<a name=310:25></a> D------ says 'Brethren representing several meetings at Chicago', etc.<a name=310:26></a> And Mr.<a name=310:27></a>------ speaks of all the meetings in the belt from Minneapolis to Cincinnati and from the Missouri river to Detroit being of one mind as to
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=311>[Page 311]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Columbus.<a name=311:1></a> The number of meetings is also mentioned in the Chicago letter, so that there was clearly <i>some</i> idea of representation; but I did not say there was, nor could I say now that the mind of the twelve meetings was represented.<a name=311:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Seventh: You say, 'We never had such an absurd idea as that one meeting could commend another meeting to another meeting or brethren generally'.<a name=311:3></a> You ask, 'Where did you get that idea?<a name=311:4></a>' I saw it first in Mr.<a name=311:5></a>------'s letter of December 24th to Mr.<a name=311:6></a> H------ (now withdrawn).<a name=311:7></a>------ writes (referring to the company at Columbus), 'It appears to me that the first and vital link is that you should be commended in the love and fellowship of those nearest you from where you move, that is Chicago'.<a name=311:8></a> Chicago's commendation of the saints at Columbus would obviously not be to themselves, but to nearby meetings, as ------ says earlier in his letter 'Chicago .<a name=311:9></a>.<a name=311:10></a>.<a name=311:11></a> commanded Michigan City to your brethren elsewhere'.<a name=311:12></a> Then in your letter of January 5th, I read, 'Chicago .<a name=311:13></a>.<a name=311:14></a>.<a name=311:15></a> having been mainly responsible for recommending to brethren generally .<a name=311:16></a>.<a name=311:17></a>.<a name=311:18></a> the breaking of bread at Michigan City'.<a name=311:19></a> Mr.<a name=311:20></a> D------ cites substantially what ------ wrote as of 'first importance' in the mind of 'brethren representing several meetings in Chicago'.<a name=311:21></a> His words are 'to commend the movement to the nearest meeting to Columbus'.<a name=311:22></a>------ had read his letter at the Chicago meetings.<a name=311:23></a> You embody part of it in your letter of January 5th, as the 'judgment', while Mr.<a name=311:24></a> D------ gives it all.<a name=311:25></a> There is no suggestion from any source that ------'s thought of <i>commendation</i> by Chicago was to be replaced by the idea of Michigan City <i>consulting</i> Chicago.<a name=311:26></a> The above will show you how I obtained 'that idea'.<a name=311:27></a> It is indeed 'absurd', as you say.<a name=311:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Eighth: The records I referred to as to Chicago's knowledge of the movement from Michigan City are correspondence in November between Mr H------ and ------ that Mr H------'s letter was private, as you say, does not rob it of a prime importance as to the matter before us.<a name=311:29></a> It contained information as to the Lord's people in a town in which the brethren at Chicago profess to have had the greatest interest and this information indicated plainly the possible 'sorrow' of the discontinuance of the meeting there, nearly all of the saints having moved or were about to move away.<a name=311:30></a> It was addressed to the corresponding brother and most active one in Chicago, and so it could be rightly expected that through him it would
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=312>[Page 312]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		reach all.<a name=312:1></a> If not the said brother would have been neglectful in a most serious matter -- I am speaking from the point of view of the letter of January 5th.<a name=312:2></a> But you do not say that my brother failed to make the information known.<a name=312:3></a> Mr.<a name=312:4></a> H------ states in his letter to Chicago that my brother conveyed it in a letter to Columbus on November 24th.<a name=312:5></a> As a matter of fact the purposed movement from Michigan City was advertised more widely than I have known of any occurrence of the kind, and so the question may well be asked: Had Chicago not heard?<a name=312:6></a> The word had certainly "gone out" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#10">Romans  10</a>).<a name=312:7></a> Admitting that it was not addressed directly to you there, even a report should lead to inquiry, seeing you were so responsible, as the letter of January 5th states.<a name=312:8></a> A report reaching the ears of the assembly at Jerusalem led to earnest action (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#11">Acts  11</a>), and Paul was moved to act seriously by a report (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5">1 Corinthians  5</a>).<a name=312:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From the facts available it is clear that if the movement of the saints from Michigan City was fraught with such consequences as your letter of January 5th states, the brethren in Chicago (at least the one who received Mr.<a name=312:10></a> H------'s letter) were very remiss in not seeking to save their brethren.<a name=312:11></a> Neither the assembly at Jerusalem nor Paul (in the passages quoted) waited to be 'consulted' before acting.<a name=312:12></a> But on the other hand, if the brethren late of Michigan City moved to Columbus believing they were subject to the will of God in doing so, the meeting at Michigan City thus necessarily discontinuing, they having made known their purpose to their brethren, including Chicago, as said above, having thus violated no scriptural principle, the brethren in Chicago, by telephoning to Columbus to prevent the breaking of bread there and in the course that followed, have disregarded Scripture, having interfered with matters beyond their local responsibility.<a name=312:13></a> The remaining matters under section 8 I do not touch, having reference to local conduct and relations.<a name=312:14></a> These must be settled in a 'lawful assembly', that is Columbus.<a name=312:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ninth and Tenth: The same may be said of these sections, as we who have not been among the saints at Columbus cannot rightly judge of the state and spiritual ability among them.<a name=312:16></a> There seems to have been hesitancy in the nearby meetings as to the J------ brothers, but as I said, it is a local matter.<a name=312:17></a> I cannot see the force of the brothers asking for fellowship by themselves.<a name=312:18></a> There is no suggestion of special importance

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Eleventh: You enquire, 'To whom did those remaining at Michigan City commend those who moved to Columbus?<a name=313:6></a>' To the saints in Columbus, of course.<a name=313:7></a> Paul says, "To all that are in Rome, beloved of God, called saints", and he commended Phoebe to them.<a name=313:8></a> This would hold, however few or many, it is quite in order to commend a saint to another, the latter being alone in a place.<a name=313:9></a> There would then be "two of you".<a name=313:10></a> The divine nature operating in us makes us very simple and practical.<a name=313:11></a> In Columbus there are several ostensibly holding together in the light of the assembly.<a name=313:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Twelfth: 'Where did you get the idea of disciplinary authority you speak of?<a name=313:13></a>' I got it from Mr.<a name=313:14></a> D------.<a name=313:15></a> He says, 'It was quite understood that the brethren at Chicago had expressed themselves that no encouragement should be given to them (the H------ s) to move about'.<a name=313:16></a> Mr.<a name=313:17></a> D------ was instrumental in putting this into effect as to ------ and ------ at Hamilton on New Year's Day, causing much feeling and resentment among the saints.<a name=313:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thirteenth: I cannot enter on Mr.<a name=313:19></a> H------'s reasons for leaving Michigan City.<a name=313:20></a> What you say of Michigan City reminds me of a remark made lately that the Chicago brethren seemed to be more concerned about the town than about the saints who had resided there.<a name=313:21></a> These, however, are loved by Christ and are like the apple of His eye at Columbus.<a name=313:22></a> There are hundreds of towns in this country much less cared for in testimony than Michigan City -- Chicago perhaps relatively.<a name=313:23></a> In judging our brethren's legitimate movements we are disregarding that in this respect they stand to their own Master.<a name=313:24></a>

		My Dear Brother, -- Your letter of the 25th ultimo was received late as I was away from New York and did not return until last week.<a name=321:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am sorry you are so seriously troubled over what has been said recently about our Lord's sonship.<a name=321:9></a> I am assured you will find in time that there is no real cause for this.<a name=321:10></a> What was said at Barnet conveyed what had long been in the minds of many brethren, the expressions 'Eternal Son' and 'Eternal Word' being regarded as questionable as wanting of scriptural warrant.<a name=321:11></a> I have weighed the matter much before the Lord since, especially in regard of what has been advanced in support of the expressions, and I am confirmed in what I have held.<a name=321:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It has often been said that we should get thoughts <i>from</i> Scripture and not take any to it.<a name=321:13></a> In the latter case we are exposed to the danger of forcing Scripture to our view.<a name=321:14></a> You quote <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:14">John  1:14</a>, 18 as 'ample proof' of your view.<a name=321:15></a> Then you proceed: 'The Greek words for' who is 'in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:18">John  1:18</a> are equivalent to' I am 'or the Eternal One -- the One who is, and do not refer to time at all'.<a name=321:16></a> This statement illustrates what I said.<a name=321:17></a> The verse treats of <i>relationship and position</i>, not eternal existence as in chapter 8: 24, 58.<a name=321:18></a> Thus "who is in the bosom of the Father" is a <i>present</i> fact in regard of the matter to be spoken of -- the declaration of God.<a name=321:19></a> Earlier in the chapter references to the Lord's eternal existence are in the past tense and we damage the truth and ourselves if we do not pay attention to this.<a name=321:20></a> In considering a subject so profound, holy and delicate, it is of the utmost importance to observe
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=322>[Page 322]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		every word and all that attaches to it that the Holy Spirit uses.<a name=322:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so the preposition "in" in verse 18 must be noted.<a name=322:2></a> It denotes motion towards -- that thus the position was reached.<a name=322:3></a> Added to the tense of the verb governing it and the relationship of Christ to the Father, the preposition conveys that He is viewed as Man.<a name=322:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Of this preposition you say, 'It has recently come to light and I think has been thoroughly well established that in <i>New Testament</i> Greek' eis 'is used in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:18">John  1:18</a> without any idea of motion at all, but rather of proximity to'.<a name=322:5></a> This reminds me of the 'higher critic's' way of furnishing evidence -- 'It has recently come to light .<a name=322:6></a>.<a name=322:7></a>.<a name=322:8></a> thoroughly well established'.<a name=322:9></a> But by whom?<a name=322:10></a> How?<a name=322:11></a> 'Eis' is employed about 1,600 times in the New Testament and in the vast majority of instances, including passages similar in structure to <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:18">John  1:18</a>, it expresses motion towards (compare Englishman's Greek Concordance).<a name=322:12></a> How then does New Testament Greek show that in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:18">John  1:18</a> it is just proximity?<a name=322:13></a> If position <i>only</i> were meant, 'en' would be more intensive as proper to the relation of sonship and is indeed used in chapter 14 -- "I am in my Father".<a name=322:14></a> 'En' is also used in <a href="../bible/John.htm#13:23">John  13:23</a> to convey the beloved disciple's position; 'epi' in verse 25.<a name=322:15></a> If proximity were in view, 'para', as in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:14">John  1:14</a>, would be appropriate.<a name=322:16></a> 'Pros' is used in verse 1 as more intensive, implying association in equality, essential being, with God.<a name=322:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As I said, we must observe carefully the words the Holy Spirit uses and if, as in the present case, He uses a preposition implying motion towards when He could have used others, we are bound to own that He did so with a purpose; He knew that Greek readers would necessarily regard the word according to its ordinary or general meaning.<a name=322:18></a> Ellicott in his Commentary says, 'The' is in 'is probably to be explained by the return to, and presence with the Father after the ascension'.<a name=322:19></a> I believe they refer to the Lord as Man before and after the ascension, but I quote the commentator to show how a scholar regarded the verb and preposition here.<a name=322:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You say, 'The words "only begotten" in the same verse have no reference to being born at all .<a name=322:21></a>.<a name=322:22></a>.<a name=322:23></a> the words convey the thought of "darling" or "only one"'.<a name=322:24></a> Here again is a statement without adequate proof.<a name=322:25></a> I have not 'Greville Ewing's Lexicon' but I have Strong's 'Exhaustive', G.<a name=322:26></a>V.<a name=322:27></a>W.<a name=322:28></a>'s and Young's, and none of them indicates that the words "only

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=323>[Page 323]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		begotten" 'have no reference to being born at all'.<a name=323:1></a> On the contrary, they all give the words as including the idea of birth.<a name=323:2></a> Besides, according to G.<a name=323:3></a>V.<a name=323:4></a>W.<a name=323:5></a>, the word 'monogenees', other than the references to Christ, is only used in the New Testament in connection with children.<a name=323:6></a> Then the context helps.<a name=323:7></a> The only one of a <i>father</i> (and <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:14">John  1:14</a> is illustrative) would be a son or child.<a name=323:8></a> If a <i>husband</i> speaks thus (as in <a href="../bible/SongofSongs.htm#6:9">Song of Songs  6:9</a>) he would refer to his wife.<a name=323:9></a> Another thing to be noted is that we must not assume that the Holy Spirit is not loved of other Divine Persons, and this would be at least beclouded if we say that one of the Persons <i>viewed as in the Deity</i> is an only one to Another.<a name=323:10></a> Applying the term of endearment to Jesus as Man is intelligible, for He only became flesh; as Man He was contemplated in this blessed relationship.<a name=323:11></a> When this is made to apply to Christ as in the <i>form of God</i>, describing His relationship then with Him whom we know in revelation as the First Person of the Trinity, I cannot follow -- I feel forbidden by Scripture.<a name=323:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The chapter we are considering (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>) is expressly intended to instruct us -- in relation to others, of course -- on this great subject of our Lord's Person, and we must err unless we pay strict attention to the order in which it presents it, and, as I said, the words used.<a name=323:13></a> In verse 1 His essentially divine eternal Personal existence is stated; in verse 14 the condition He took or "became" -- He was a Man among men, and contemplated by some as an object of the intensest affection to the Father; verse 18 presents Him further as Man, the Holy Spirit formally designating (verse 14 is a description by others of what <i>they saw</i>) Him as 'The only begotten Son', and the position reached (redemption as well as incarnation included) in connection with the declaration of God.<a name=323:14></a> It is <i>present and abiding</i>.<a name=323:15></a> Except verse 18 all the references to the Lord's sonship in the chapter are to what <i>men saw</i>, verse 18 being a formal designation by the Holy Spirit, but in keeping with the others.<a name=323:16></a> To make what men saw descriptive of relations in essential Deity is, I am certain, going beyond Scripture, it being expressly stated that no one had seen God at any time, indeed that He cannot be seen by men.<a name=323:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The designation "Word" is characteristic, referring to the Lord as speaking or expressing the <i>mind</i> of God.<a name=323:18></a> It has an active and necessarily mediatorial significance, for in making known the mind of God He was acting for Him.<a name=323:19></a> John uses
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=324>[Page 324]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		it obviously not as a title revealed by his gospel but as one known amongst saints.<a name=324:1></a> The Lord was that practically and known as such.<a name=324:2></a> His Sonship was announced at His birth and later from heaven; then too Emmanuel, Jesus, Christ, Saviour, Lord, etc.<a name=324:3></a>, are divinely announced in the gospels but not the Word.<a name=324:4></a> In <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#19">Revelation  19</a>He has a name written which no one knows but Himself, but His name is <i>called</i> The Word of God.<a name=324:5></a> This is characteristic -- it is not said to be written -- and so known.<a name=324:6></a> It agrees with the use of the term "Word" by John and Luke.<a name=324:7></a> Therefore, to apply this designation to the Lord as in absolute Deity is unsupported by Scripture to say the very least.<a name=324:8></a> It seems to me that the word 'Logos' being so much used in the Lord's service and so characteristic of it, so commonly used, so to speak, and applied to Him, that the Spirit employed it instead of Son in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:1">John  1:1</a> to preclude the idea of it being applicable to essential Deity.<a name=324:9></a> When there was no speaking or revealing the mind of God (and there could not be the need of this as between divine Persons as such) the designation "Word" could have no place, but it had force when God began to operate.<a name=324:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And this leads me to another important consideration -- the mediatorial sphere, which existed before incarnation, but necessarily had the incarnation in view.<a name=324:11></a> All God's operations, as far as Scripture shows, were on the mediatorial principle, and the Son was the Mediator.<a name=324:12></a> Thus looking back we have to take account of absolute Deity outside the mediatorial sphere and beyond creature understanding; and then we have to consider "the beginning", which implies the mediatorial system which looked on to and centred in Christ as Man.<a name=324:13></a> He was no afterthought, Adam being but a figure of Him.<a name=324:14></a> Whatever the instrumentalities used, the Son was the Mediator.<a name=324:15></a> This relationship being in purpose, He was in the mind of God in this light, although it cannot be scripturally said that He was actually in it while in the form of God, for Scripture presents sonship as implying subjection and obedience.<a name=324:16></a> There was the promise -- to someone -- of life before the ages of time and a choosing in Christ before the foundation of the world.<a name=324:17></a> All centred in Christ become Man, the material creation itself being preliminarily essential to this.<a name=324:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having looked into the matter of 'eternal sonship' and 'eternal word', I am persuaded they originate in theology.<a name=324:19></a> As creed-making began, there was a felt need of definitions,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=325>[Page 325]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and theologians did not hesitate to attempt to define the relations existing among divine Persons as in absolute Deity.<a name=325:1></a> This resulted in much blasphemous error; but even orthodoxy is not free from this as is to be seen in the 'Creed of St.<a name=325:2></a> Athanasius'.<a name=325:3></a> Here it is stated that our Lord was begotten of the Father before the worlds and begotten of His mother in the world; 'one, not by confusion of substance, but by unity of Person'.<a name=325:4></a> He is 'of a reasonable soul and human flesh subsisting'.<a name=325:5></a> God and man (dual personality) is 'one Christ'.<a name=325:6></a> The thought conveyed is that the Lord was personally a man with 'reasonable soul', as we are, and <i>besides</i> this is another 'substance', God, <i>another</i> Person, the unity was not 'confusion of substance', but of Person.<a name=325:7></a> Thus Christ was a union of God and man, a dual Person, <i>not</i> a divine Person become flesh; the latter is the truth Scripture presents.<a name=325:8></a> There is no change in the Lord's Person, but in His condition.<a name=325:9></a> "The word became flesh".<a name=325:10></a> As in this condition He could say, "Before Abraham was I am" -- the Person is unchanged: "the same yesterday, and today and forever".<a name=325:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I mention all this because of the place the Creed has or had with some who have objected to certain features of the truth of our Lord's Person from time to time since 1890.<a name=325:12></a> Mr.<a name=325:13></a> J.<a name=325:14></a> A.<a name=325:15></a> Trench was one of the most able of those, and perhaps the most highly esteemed of those who led in the Glanton movement.<a name=325:16></a> The following will show the importance he attached to the Creed.<a name=325:17></a> The meeting room long used by the brethren in Sligo was his and leased in the usual way.<a name=325:18></a> The brothers who signed the lease did not read it, assuming its contents to be such as a brother would ordinarily require.<a name=325:19></a> A few days after the Glanton division occurred, however, Mr.<a name=325:20></a> James C.<a name=325:21></a> Trench, acting for his brother, served a notice of ejection on the brethren who signed the lease.<a name=325:22></a> When they remonstrated he directed them to read the lease and it was found that it required that the room was to be used for the breaking of bread, preaching the gospel, etc.<a name=325:23></a>, by brethren <i>who held the Athanasian Creed</i>.<a name=325:24></a> As it was judged the brethren did not now hold this Creed, the lease was cancelled.<a name=325:25></a> The brothers (now with the Lord) who signed the lease and who had directly to do with this transaction told me of it together, and I am sure it will be confirmed by brothers in Sligo.<a name=325:26></a>

		I agree with what you say as to <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3:25">Romans  3:25</a> -- the new punctuation seems forced.<a name=326:17></a> Faith is a principle in a person, and while Divine Persons are properly the objects of it, it includes all that is presented on their part.<a name=326:18></a> Thus as the blood of Christ is said to effect certain things I believe what is said and in this sense believe in it.<a name=326:19></a> Hence "The faith" -- what is believed.<a name=326:20></a> The blood (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#5">1 John  5</a>) is one of the "three" that bear witness and I believe <i>its</i> witness.<a name=326:21></a>

		As regards 'Eternal Sonship', I am assured the Lord is through the exercise asserting the authority of Scripture and that in due course its teaching as to His Person and revelation generally will be much more clearly understood.<a name=326:22></a> Hitherto much had to be <i>assumed</i> in treating certain passages, such as <a href="../bible/John.htm#5">John  5</a>.<a name=326:23></a> I cannot find that John 5 deals (save as accepting what was generally held) with the Lord's statements of Himself as Son in this and kindred scriptures.<a name=326:24></a> Nothing has exercised me more than this matter, but as waiting on the Lord I am confirmed that what was said at Barnet is in accord with the teaching of Scripture and makes for a clearer and truer apprehension of Deity and of revelation.<a name=326:25></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My Dear Brother, -- Yours of the 15th inst.<a name=332:7></a> is just received, for which I thank you.<a name=332:8></a> I am thankful for your statement, 'If anything I have said has seemed to convey a slight upon, or indifference to, the' powers that be 'it is not meant and I would regret it;' but the following from 'City Boundaries' will show that it does not meet the exercises of your brethren: 'I am clear that the saints in a given place .<a name=332:9></a>.<a name=332:10></a>.<a name=332:11></a> are clothed with responsibilities .<a name=332:12></a>.<a name=332:13></a>.<a name=332:14></a> peculiar to that locality .<a name=332:15></a>.<a name=332:16></a>.<a name=332:17></a> but one does question whether the import of this is made to depend on bounds and limits imposed by temporal powers.<a name=332:18></a> I think not, but that we are left in liberty to decide the question according to our own perception of what results from contact with our brethren and our community of interest with them; in short that the' powers that be 'are as much unrelated to this matter as they are, for instance, as to where we meet for the breaking of bread or for prayer'.<a name=332:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Whatever you may have had in your mind or overlooked when you wrote, these are your words, and they take definite issue with what we in New York have acted upon for years as a principle divinely obligatory and which saints generally recognise.<a name=332:20></a> What I have quoted disregards the plain fact that Scripture regards cities as having definite boundaries, measurements being taken from them to other places.<a name=332:21></a> There is not the slightest hint that these boundaries were other than those set by the authorities.<a name=332:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Saints, as far as I know, have no idea of the powers that be <i>controlling</i> them in an <i>active</i> way as to the spheres of their assembly responsibility, it is a question of God and what He orders; He addresses His assembly <i>in Corinth;</i> He did not build Corinth nor set its boundaries; He recognised the city
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=333>[Page 333]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>as it was</i> and His people in it.<a name=333:1></a> This is the whole matter; and the principle involved remains.<a name=333:2></a> There is no analogy between it and <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2">2 Timothy  2</a>, for the latter has to do with the ruin of the church, whereas the world is not in principle any more ruined now than it was in the apostle's days.<a name=333:3></a> Cities are, of course, larger generally and more irregular, but we cannot make this an excuse for disregarding a scriptural principle.<a name=333:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The application of it may be difficult in some places, and of course we must leave with our brethren in each locality the determination of the limits within which they are to maintain their local assembly responsibilities, but if they avow in doing this 'that the' powers that be 'are .<a name=333:5></a>.<a name=333:6></a>.<a name=333:7></a> unrelated to this matter', then a protest has to be entered, for issue is taken with God's way.<a name=333:8></a> They are making their own boundaries of 'Corinth' instead of accepting what exists.<a name=333:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From the outset I have felt it necessary to speak or write frankly as to this matter, and I would suggest now that the only way to meet effectually the consciences of the brethren as to 'City Boundaries' is to withdraw what remains -- you have already withdrawn some of it -- of the paper unequivocally.<a name=333:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What is particularly distressing is that what you are combating now as serious error was for a considerable time before your reception known to you to be held among the brethren whose fellowship you sought and obtained.<a name=333:20></a> You were present at the conference at Barnet where the statements you now refuse were openly and frankly made, and afterwards took your place in fellowship with those who made them.<a name=333:21></a> I had conversation with you during the meetings at Barnet and later in Scotland, and you made no adverse comment on what others and myself had said on the great subject of our Lord's sonship.<a name=333:22></a>

		The first intimation I had of your adverse attitude was in a long controversial letter from you which came early this year -- more than a year and a half after the Barnet meetings.<a name=334:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Added to above is the unseemliness of one who had been admittedly in an unrighteous association for twenty years, returning to the saints whom he had erroneously left, and then almost immediately taking a lead in controversy against them, and this in regard to a subject requiring the most mature spiritual judgment.<a name=334:3></a> Thus aside from the matter of contention, there is a moral incongruity in your position of which you seem entirely insensible.<a name=334:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I would suggest -- without any bitter feeling, I assure you -- that this is the outcome of the leaven of your recent association.<a name=334:5></a> I firmly believe this.<a name=334:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Reviewing your history from the time of our meeting at Barnet, I am convinced that you failed to judge as before God the evil principles and conduct of the system you had left, and correspondingly you did not face, so as to understand them, the truths and principles maintained amongst the brethren into whose fellowship you came.<a name=334:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not write to condemn you, dear brother, far otherwise -- I wish to help you, and to this end I must tell you the truth.<a name=334:8></a> I gather from your letter to Mr.<a name=334:9></a> Higgins of November 30th that you have not returned to those with Glanton and so I would fain hope that you may be saved even yet for the testimony.<a name=334:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not enter on the contents of your letters, save to observe that you do not allow in your conscience the full weight of what has been said by others and myself as to the subject in question.<a name=334:11></a> I should, of course, gladly review the truth of Christ's sonship with you in a brotherly way if opportunity offers.<a name=334:12></a> You may be interested to see a letter I wrote Mr.<a name=334:13></a> Allen Oliver on the subject which conveys the truth, as I understand it, fairly well; if so Mr.<a name=334:14></a> R.<a name=334:15></a> Besley would, I believe, supply you with a copy.<a name=334:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would also point out that you build too much on <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#7:3">Hebrews  7:3</a>, which, according to right exegetic principles, has to be considered in its context; otherwise it will be made to clash with other scriptures.<a name=334:17></a> This indeed is what your use of it does.<a name=334:18></a> Scripture abounds with references to God being Father to Christ.<a name=334:19></a> The designation "Son of God", employed in the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What is alluded to in the verse is clearly the parentage or genealogy needed by Aaronic priests (see Ezra and Nehemiah).<a name=335:5></a> Melchisedec had none as far as Scripture shows (and the facts, positive and negative, of <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#14">Genesis  14</a>are under review) and yet he was priest of the Most High God.<a name=335:6></a> His priesthood did not depend on his genealogy but on himself, hence the greatness of this person as compared with an Aaronic priest.<a name=335:7></a> But while the designation "Son of God" implies that God is Christ's Father, it also denotes the greatness of His Person -- who He is.<a name=335:8></a> He is derived from no one.<a name=335:9></a> He is "I AM".<a name=335:10></a> He has neither beginning of days nor end of life -- "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, and today, and to the ages to come".<a name=335:11></a> This statement, <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#13:8">Hebrews  13:8</a>, shows that names applying to our Lord in time may be employed to designate His Person as in the past eternity without intimating that they applied to Him <i>then</i>.<a name=335:12></a>

		It was good of you to write so fully as to Forest Hill.<a name=337:8></a> I valued the information much, as I was very concerned as to the meeting, which was pending at the time of our sailing for New York.<a name=337:9></a> It seemed clear from your letter that the trend of the meeting was in the right direction; but there has not been much to confirm this, as far as I have heard, since.<a name=337:10></a> But we must be patient, for God will certainly bring to a right result what He has begun.<a name=337:11></a> It was a good sign that ------ sent a message of love to the brethren coupled with a reference to <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:1">Ephesians  1:1</a>, 2.<a name=337:12></a> Disregard of this scripture has marked his whole course in this sorrow.<a name=337:13></a> He is peculiarly determined, and his brother,------, is like him.<a name=337:14></a> When the latter was here last he alleged to Mr.<a name=337:15></a> H------, the latter's two sons being present, that my influence prevented brethren in Great Britain forming judgments of their own -- or words to this effect.<a name=337:16></a> When I heard this I wrote him at once, but I cannot get an answer from him as to whether he made such a serious statement or not.<a name=337:17></a> He wrote me during my illness for an interview, but I was unable to meet him before sailing, and begged him to meet the matter in writing.<a name=337:18></a> He refuses -- charging that I had promised (of which I have no recollection) to meet him and failed to do so.<a name=337:19></a> A similar way marks Mr.<a name=337:20></a>------'s brother-in-law on this side of the Atlantic.<a name=337:21></a> During several recent years he has said and done things that are out of keeping with Scripture, and when they are -- one by one -- brought to his attention he will defend them to the last ditch.<a name=337:22></a> Happily, in some of the most serious cases he has surrendered.<a name=337:23></a> Would that his brothers-in-law would do the same!<a name=337:24></a> I mention ------ because his way, coupled with theirs, marks a family vein of opposition which is noticeable, and has been a source of deep concern to me, at least, for many years.<a name=337:25></a>

		Beloved Brother, -- Your letter is very interesting to me, and I desired to reply at once, as it was received, but my hands have been more than full.<a name=338:11></a> Even now I can write but briefly.<a name=338:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The distinct impression your letter makes, is that you do not allow full weight to the facts which Scripture presents as to our Lord's sonship.<a name=338:13></a> I refer particularly to John's gospel, which, as you say, 'presents Him as Son of God.<a name=338:14></a> He comes, as it were, out of eternity, touches the earth, and then goes back into eternity', you rightly say; but this is the <i>Person</i>.<a name=338:15></a> If it were intended to be conveyed that His relation in the Deity was that of Son, the Holy Spirit would surely say, 'The <i>Son</i> became flesh;' but He does not, but "The Word", etc.<a name=338:16></a> Not indeed, that if He did say "The Son", this would be conclusive, but the fact that He did not, indicates clearly that He is guarding against the thought of eternal sonship.<a name=338:17></a> What John says he and others contemplated is not a <i>formal</i> statement of our Lord's sonship, but that His glory was <i>as</i> the glory of "an only-begotten with a father" -- it is descriptive.<a name=338:18></a> With the exception of verse 18, the references to Christ's sonship in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>are records of what others saw or discerned in Him.<a name=338:19></a> In verse 18 the only-begotten Son <i>is</i> in the bosom of the Father -- not <i>was</i>.<a name=338:20></a> In verses 1 and 2 it is "was".<a name=338:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You write, 'So when He comes to speak of those divine relationships He still uses human terms and calls them Father and Son.<a name=338:22></a> This is not a new relationship'.<a name=338:23></a> How do you know
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=339>[Page 339]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that it is not?<a name=339:1></a> Your further remark (as to the relationship not being new) 'No more than in the Man Christ Jesus do I see a new God', does not help for we are definitely told in Scripture that there is but "one God" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:6">Ephesians  4:6</a>).<a name=339:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then you go on to say, 'It is the human expression that God has used to convey to me the wonderful relations of divine Persons, I cannot comprehend it, no more than I can comprehend God'.<a name=339:3></a> Here again Scripture is not allowed its force.<a name=339:4></a> We are told by it, that no one has seen God -- "Whom no man has seen, nor is able to see" (1 Timothy 6: 16) but of the Son it is said that His glory was contemplated by men as the glory of an only-begotten with a father -- they saw the relationship (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:14">John  1:14</a>).<a name=339:5></a> You urge that we must guard against materialism, but to what materialism do you refer?<a name=339:6></a> The disciples (some of them at least) saw the Word as become flesh as in the relation of an only-begotten with a father.<a name=339:7></a> They saw Him as become <i>flesh</i> not as in the form of God, this being beyond the creature's vision.<a name=339:8></a> Surely, 'all these terms', as you write, 'are used to convey spiritual ideas', but sonship in Christ is an actual reality brought within man's range in Him as Man, and so is more than a spiritual idea.<a name=339:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You write, 'If you say it was not till He reached earth that He became Son, it loses its lustre'.<a name=339:10></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>Jehovah says, "Thou art my Son; <i>I</i> this day have begotten thee".<a name=339:11></a> This is used in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:8">Hebrews  1:8</a> as expressing sonship in the fullest sense, e.<a name=339:12></a>g.<a name=339:13></a> "as to the Son, Thy throne, O God", etc.<a name=339:14></a>; you will not, I am sure, deny that Psalm 2 refers to what took place on earth, nor affirm that because it did take place in time and on earth the sonship of Christ has lost its lustre.<a name=339:15></a> If you say it is <i>another</i> sonship you are at variance with Scripture.<a name=339:16></a> All that our Lord's Person is, enters into the sonship according to the epistle to the Hebrews.<a name=339:17></a> <i>How</i> a divine Person, being thus God ("The Word was God"), could be born or 'come of' a woman is infinite mystery, but it is a fact and we bow in worship in the presence of it.<a name=339:18></a> It seems to me that this stupendous transaction has but little place in the minds of the saints.<a name=339:19></a> As here God says to Christ, "Thou art my Son, <i>I this day</i> have begotten thee".<a name=339:20></a> This clearly guards against the error of the 'Creed' that He was begotten of His Father before all worlds, but begotten in time by His mother.<a name=339:21></a> "<i>I</i> (emphatic) <i>this day</i>".<a name=339:22></a> One saying, because Scripture does not show it, that He was not in the relation of Son before, cannot weaken

	<div class="paragraph">
		The early part of paragraph 3, page 3 of your letter is a convenient way of settling a matter, the understanding of which requires the most profound spiritual thought, and weighing of one Scripture with another.<a name=340:8></a> According to your remarks here <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>is Messiah, <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:28">John  14:28</a> is Christ in manhood, and <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11:27">Matthew  11:27</a> as in Deity.<a name=340:9></a> The first as I have shown, is regarded in the New Testament (and the New Testament gives the full bearing of the Old Testament) as sonship in the fullest sense and so cannot be <i>limited</i> to the thought of the Messiah.<a name=340:10></a> Then while the Person of the Son is in view in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11:27">Matthew  11:27</a> and while He, of course, has part in the Deity, yet He is speaking of Himself as He then was -- He was inscrutable save to the Father.<a name=340:11></a> To say that this is Sonship before incarnation is simply to <i>add</i> to Scripture.<a name=340:12></a> You say, 'To infer from this verse (<a href="../bible/John.htm#14:28">John  14:28</a>) that the Son of God is inferior to God', etc.<a name=340:13></a> I certainly have no such thought that there is, or could be any <i>absolute</i> inferiority; but <i>relative</i> inferiority, involving subjection, is implied in the relationship of Son and constantly applied by the Lord to Himself in this relationship.<a name=340:14></a> This is undeniable and it is also undeniable that the thoughts, relations, etc.<a name=340:15></a>, thus involved and expressed cannot be applied to Him as in the form of God, i.<a name=340:16></a>e.<a name=340:17></a> before incarnation.<a name=340:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:2">Hebrews  1:2</a> (page 4), what you remark is just building on the title, or designation of relationship, rather than on the <i>Person</i>.<a name=340:19></a> "By whom" is the Person.<a name=340:20></a> But in saying this I am jealous not to weaken the great force of the passage,

		for while other designations are used to indicate the Lord's glorious Person, "Son" is usually employed by the Spirit to convey it fully; e.<a name=341:1></a>g.<a name=341:2></a> "unto the Son he says".<a name=341:3></a> What you say as to Wellington does not set aside M.<a name=341:4></a>W.<a name=341:5></a>B.<a name=341:6></a>'s thought.<a name=341:7></a> That he was the son of Wellesley at Eton and 'ever since he existed' is true, but to apply this to our Lord is just 'begging the question' and hence valueless.<a name=341:8></a> You say, 'Son expresses relationship and that cannot be made'.<a name=341:9></a> 'Made' is vague, but sonship is in Scripture, the result of begetting or adoption; in either case it is the result of a transaction.<a name=341:10></a> Christ is the only-begotten Son; we are adopted.<a name=341:11></a>

		The weakness of the writer's position appears at the outset (page 4), as he is compelled to put something into the quotation he gives from the 'prominent leader' so as to make it the subject of adverse criticism.<a name=341:18></a> The quotation in part is, 'The essence, or being, of God is not a subject of revelation;' the criticism in part is 'He .<a name=341:19></a>.<a name=341:20></a>.<a name=341:21></a> confuses the .<a name=341:22></a>.<a name=341:23></a>.<a name=341:24></a> essence of God and the relations between divine Persons in the Godhead'.<a name=341:25></a> The <i>quotation</i> says nothing about relations.<a name=341:26></a> Mr.<a name=341:27></a> W------ says the 'prominent leader' writes thus of sonship, but the quotation refers to 'essence or being' which is not relationship.<a name=341:28></a> The paper then goes on, 'To advance the thought that in the Godhead .<a name=341:29></a>.<a name=341:30></a>.<a name=341:31></a> such wonderful Persons have no relationship the one with the other'.<a name=341:32></a> Who has advanced such a thought?<a name=341:33></a> I certainly have not heard of it.<a name=341:34></a> Then follows, 'And .<a name=341:35></a>.<a name=341:36></a>.<a name=341:37></a> to deny to such Persons, if relationship does exist, the ability to reveal Themselves in that relationship is unconsciously to assume a knowledge that has placed a limit even upon God Himself'.<a name=341:38></a> Who has made such a denial?<a name=341:39></a> The writer adduces no evidence that anyone has done so.<a name=341:40></a> He is

		Returning to <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#7">Hebrews  7</a>, I suppose what is alluded to in the quotation given above from page 16 is what appeared in the Barnet notes as to the Lord's sonship, but the eternal <i>Personality</i> of our Lord is most emphatically stated in these notes and elsewhere, and this is fully admitted by Mr.<a name=346:17></a> W------ (page 1).<a name=346:18></a> How then can what is conveyed 'involve the error that the Son of God had beginning of days?<a name=346:19></a>' <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#7">Hebrews  7</a>treats of the Person of the Son of God, who is ever the same -- "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, and today and to the ages to come".<a name=346:20></a> In this section of Hebrews the Son is introduced from <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>.<a name=346:21></a> "Thou art my Son; <i>I</i> this day have begotten thee".<a name=346:22></a> Here His sonship begins in time, but this, of course, cannot affect His

		As to revelation (page 16), while the word is current amongst Christians, it is worthy of note that when the thought of God being made known is formally introduced (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>18) the word is "declared", not 'revealed'.<a name=347:3></a> No one has seen God at any time, but the Son has declared Him.<a name=347:4></a> Revelation is used as to the Father, but to <i>certain</i> persons, not general, as far as I can find.<a name=347:5></a> The Son, as to His Person, is not said to be revealed.<a name=347:6></a> He is known to the Father only.<a name=347:7></a> "To reveal his Son in me", does not, of course, weaken this, and cannot include the inscrutability of our Lord's Person referred to in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11:27">Matthew  11:27</a>.<a name=347:8></a> The rolling away of a veil from before an 'existing object' does not accurately describe what is said in Scripture of God (the Deity) being made known.<a name=347:9></a> It would imply, the veil being removed, that the Deity could be seen by the creature, which <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:18">John  1:18</a> denies.<a name=347:10></a> The Only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, has declared God.<a name=347:11></a> It is not the removing of a veil, but One telling of God, bringing Him out.<a name=347:12></a> He is thus through a Man (the Only-begotten Son) brought within the range of man's apprehension.<a name=347:13></a> It is a question of God's nature and attributes, not, of course, His essential being and form.<a name=347:14></a> While God is thus declared He, in His essential being and form, remains inscrutable -- "Whom no man has seen nor can see".<a name=347:15></a>

		As regards <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#7">Hebrews  7</a>(your notes), the chapter begins -- "For this Melchisedec" -- thus a personage is before us, concerning whom certain things are said, including the fact that he was priest of the Most High God.<a name=350:17></a> Although the <i>word</i> personage (verse 4) is not in the original, it is clearly implied, and this is confirmed by the personal pronoun "whom" immediately following.<a name=350:18></a> I do not see, therefore, how "this" can be made to refer to "the system of priesthood".<a name=350:19></a> What is in view is the person who is described in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#14">Genesis  14</a>as bearing the office of priest, so as to emphasise the force of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#110">Psalm  110</a>.<a name=350:20></a> The thought of Melchisedec's (Christ's) personal greatness runs through the chapter, culminating in verse 28 -- "the word of the swearing of the oath .<a name=350:21></a>.<a name=350:22></a>.<a name=350:23></a> a Son perfected for ever".<a name=350:24></a> We must distinguish between the Person and the office or offices He bears.<a name=350:25></a> Melchisedec had several, including priesthood, and all added to his greatness.<a name=350:26></a> Besides, he was without father, mother, genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life.<a name=350:27></a> All these features enter into his assimilation to the Son of God.<a name=350:28></a>

		What I have written as to <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#7">Hebrews  7</a>bears also on Mr.<a name=351:4></a> Higgins' thoughts.<a name=351:5></a> While, of course, priesthood is in view, the assimilating characteristics are personal.<a name=351:6></a> It is "this Melchisedec", not 'this priest'.<a name=351:7></a> "This Melchisedec" links with "abides a priest continually", what lies between is characteristic of the man, and shows that he was "likened to" the Son of God.<a name=351:8></a> I am afraid of the statement, 'He was not assimilated to Deity, but to the Son of God'.<a name=351:9></a> It exposes the one who makes it to the charge that he does not regard the Son of God as a Divine Person.<a name=351:10></a> Hebrews expressly attributes Deity to the Son (chapter 1: 8), and the fact that chapter 7 treats of priesthood does not make sonship in this chapter inferior.<a name=351:11></a> In both chapters, He is Man, but withal a Divine Person.<a name=351:12></a> If we keep the great fact of our Lord's unchanged Personality steadily before us, we shall be preserved from error in thinking or treating of Him in His forms, offices or positions.<a name=351:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is clear that the Spirit of God designed the description of Melchisedec in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#14">Genesis  14</a>so that it should convey the thought of a Divine Person on earth as Man.<a name=351:14></a> It is true that Christ's official priesthood required that He should die, rise and ascend to heaven, but His sonship existed from the outset of His incarnation.<a name=351:15></a> Hebrews stresses the Deity of the Son, and it is to the Son of God that Melchisedec is assimilated.<a name=351:16></a> In this connection it is important to note that John does not give the Lord's conception or birth, but a Divine Person becoming flesh.<a name=351:17></a> He owns His mother in John and so it is recognised that He came in through her, but still it is a Divine Person coming in and going out.<a name=351:18></a>

		The epistle starts with Paul referring to himself and Timotheus as <i>bondmen</i> of Jesus Christ.<a name=359:11></a> This is significant in view of what is before us in the verses read, indicating the kind of spirit necessary in approaching a subject so profound and holy.<a name=359:12></a> The supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#1:19">Philippians  1:19</a>) combined with that lowliness of mind referred to in chapter 2: 3, are both essential if we are to apprehend the truth the Lord is developing as to His Person at the present time.<a name=359:13></a> The merely natural mind and intelligence must be excluded and a state of soul found with us giving liberty to the Holy Spirit to impress us with His thoughts and to form us intelligently as to them.<a name=359:14></a> This state of soul was found amongst the saints at Philippi, giving the apostle perfect freedom to address them, not as apostle but as "<i>bondmen</i>".<a name=359:15></a>

		My Dear Brother, -- I duly received your letter of the 29th ult.<a name=364:15></a> and your 'observations' of the 12th inst.<a name=364:16></a> These are saddening reading, for they show unmistakably that you have not yet faced as in the presence of God your part in the sad condition that has existed in the meeting in Newcastle during recent years.<a name=364:17></a> I felt constrained as before the Lord, while at the meeting convened at Newcastle in May, to tell you in the presence of the brethren that I believed you were largely to blame for it; the letter and paper from you, referred to above, confirms me in this serious impression, and I proceed to explain.<a name=364:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You told me last year that the matter against Mr.<a name=364:19></a> M------ was settled, that he (M------ ) and others -- I cannot say whether one or more -- had been formally told that they were unrighteous persons and that God would not be with them.<a name=364:20></a> That is, as I said to you in the presence of the brethren, you were by your own showing going on in fellowship with unrighteous persons.<a name=364:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then when a local suggestion was made that a meeting should be held while I was in Newcastle, and when I wrote you as to this, you objected, saying in your letter to me there was no difficulty in Newcastle that could not be settled locally, and in the same letter asked me to meet some brothers at your house.<a name=364:22></a> Now before reaching Newcastle I had learned through conversations with several, including yourself, that a most deplorable state existed in the meeting, and on arrival this was confirmed, and the meeting of brothers which I attended disclosed such a state of feeling and cleavage that brought out the remarks made, that its assembly status was doubtful, and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=365>[Page 365]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that fellowship in a general sense was involved, this divided state having existed for more than two years and was growing worse rather than better.<a name=365:1></a> Thus your statement that there was no local difficulty that could not be settled locally was misleading as disregarding facts mentioned above.<a name=365:2></a> It was because of having confirmed on the spot the sorrowful information I had previously received that I felt I could not leave Newcastle without placing on the conscience of the brethren the serious exercises which burdened me -- that the state of the meeting involved general fellowship and that if it continued, the most serious consequences must ensue.<a name=365:3></a> How you could, as speaking before the Lord, refuse a meeting between some local and visiting brothers to take counsel as to this sorrow, saying it could be settled locally, and ask for a meeting in your house to talk over another matter, is quite inexplicable.<a name=365:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At the meeting of brothers referred to it was suggested that two or more competent brothers, acceptable to both sides in the financial dispute, should be asked to look into the purely business feature.<a name=365:5></a> This was not accepted then by Mr.<a name=365:6></a> W------, but it was by Mr.<a name=365:7></a> M------, but after a considerable time Mr.<a name=365:8></a> W------ cordially fell in with it, and the three brothers were invited to go to Newcastle with the knowledge and, as I understood, the concurrence of all.<a name=365:9></a> I cannot therefore accept your remark that the three brothers acted in the matter 'over the heads of local brethren'.<a name=365:10></a>

		In your observations you say, 'this report has no authority whatever except what our Lord may give it in the consciences of the saints'.<a name=365:11></a> The report is the testimony of three witnesses, admittedly competent to testify as to the matter in question, competent to determine the truth as to it.<a name=365:12></a> Scripture (Deuteronomy) enjoins that a matter be established at the mouth of one or two witnesses.<a name=365:13></a> The reports of our three brothers, reached on scriptural grounds, contains the truth, needed for the consciences of the saints, as to the matter of controversy and so in itself has authority -- truth involved in matters to be judged always has authority, must have, there can be no true judgment without it -- and a refusal of this is a refusal of what God orders through His word as an all-essential means of arriving at a righteous judgment by the assembly (compare <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18">Matthew  18</a>, <a href="../bible/John.htm#8:17">John  8:17</a> and other similar passages).<a name=365:14></a> Saying that the report has no authority save what the Lord gives it in the consciences of the saints is simply weakening the importance that He

		Dear Brother, -- Your letter of the 3rd inst.<a name=368:14></a> came today and its contents are so diverse from the spirit and letter of the truth that enters into the government and order of the assembly, I am compelled to send you a further line.<a name=368:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In my last I reminded you of your statement to me last year, that the matter of the charges against Mr.<a name=368:16></a> M------ was settled by a formal pronouncement that he was unrighteous and that God would not be with him, etc.<a name=368:17></a>, etc.<a name=368:18></a>; and that I pointed out to you at the brothers' meeting I attended at Newcastle that in formally pronouncing a man unrighteous and continuing in fellowship with him, you and those with you who did this constituted yourselves unrighteous (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:20">2 Timothy  2:20</a>, 21).<a name=368:19></a> You had also introduced a false principle among the saints; viz.<a name=368:20></a> that sin can be dealt with in the assembly by formally stating that it exists in a certain person.<a name=368:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You confirm all this in detail in your letter just received, and add that in the minds of the brethren the matter is thus 'closed'.<a name=368:22></a> That is, a man is formally and solemnly charged with unrighteousness (included in the list of sins in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#6:9">1 Corinthians  6:9</a>, 10) and nothing more done, the persons who so charged him continuing in fellowship with him, and thus the matter is regarded as closed!<a name=368:23></a> This is a temerity I have rarely met with in those having to do with holy things.<a name=368:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the above remarks the unrighteousness alleged as to Mr.<a name=368:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		M------ is assumed, but the report of Messrs.<a name=369:1></a> Davidson, Malpas and Biggs, and the facts appearing at the meeting I attended, show conclusively that it did not exist.<a name=369:2></a> Mr.<a name=369:3></a> M------ did acknowledge the debt to Mrs.<a name=369:4></a> D------ and paid the major part of it, and the report also says that under the circumstances the withholding of the balance sheet 'was not unreasonable'.<a name=369:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus the position is reversed: those who charged Mr.<a name=369:6></a> M------ with unrighteousness on the two counts mentioned (the non-acknowledgement of the debt and the withholding of the balance sheet) are themselves constituted unrighteous, if they refuse to own their wrong (<a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#19:16">Deuteronomy  19:16</a> - 19).<a name=369:7></a> Added to this was the false charge, as the report shows, that there had been improper dealings by Mr.<a name=369:8></a> M------ with the partnership funds and that there had been deliberate conspiracy by Mr.<a name=369:9></a> T------.<a name=369:10></a> All this places those who made these charges in a most serious position, out of which there is no escape save by unequivocal confession.<a name=369:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Besides all this, in your own case, the statement that the matter is regarded as <i>closed</i> -- underscoring yours -- after all these facts have been laid on your conscience, is a bit of effrontery to the Lord and the upright intelligence of those who know the facts of the case, to be matched only where the Lord's authority and the holy Scriptures are not regarded.<a name=369:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Your effort to place the case of Mr.<a name=369:13></a> M------ in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#6">1 Corinthians  6</a>and not chapter 5 fails of value, for the part of the former you refer to is to direct that adjudication between Christians is to be by the saints and not unbelievers, whereas the case at Newcastle is the pronouncement of unrighteousness in a brother, which according to verse 9, i.<a name=369:14></a>e.<a name=369:15></a>, would place the case in chapter 5.<a name=369:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards my suggestion that some qualified brothers might be asked to investigate the purely 'business side', this was not carried out over the heads of the brethren, as I also said in my last letter.<a name=369:17></a> It was put into effect at Mr.<a name=369:18></a> W------'s initiative some two months after I left Newcastle.<a name=369:19></a> If Mr.<a name=369:20></a> W------ did not acquaint the brethren with his purpose to act on the suggestion, the omission would be his; but I believe he did tell them of it.<a name=369:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You say the body of the brethren here '.<a name=369:22></a>.<a name=369:23></a>.<a name=369:24></a> are going on in peace:' if they are going on thus with the sin of false accusation unjudged among them, it is a false peace and so will not stand.<a name=369:25></a> But the remark sounds sinister to ears like mine, that have heard the sorrowful mutual recriminations that were

		Your statement that the examination by the three brothers 'completely set aside the nearest adjacent meeting, Wallsend', is extraordinary.<a name=370:2></a> Messrs.<a name=370:3></a> W------ and M------ requested the brothers to look into a cause of dispute between them, with the knowledge and consent, as I understand, of the Newcastle brethren, and which was carried out and a report rendered to the Newcastle brethren -- how does this completely set aside the Wallsend brethren?<a name=370:4></a> I feel morally certain that they do not think it does.<a name=370:5></a> I spoke to Messrs.<a name=370:6></a> Peart and Knight of Wallsend as to the brothers' meeting held at which I was present, suggesting that they might attend, but in the most sympathetic way they said they thought it wise not to.<a name=370:7></a>

		No, my dear brother, there was no bias in me in favour of any brother or brothers; I am perfectly clear as before the Lord that I was concerned for what was right and true, and if I <i>appeared</i> to have prejudged the matter it was because the facts which came to my attention from all sides, especially what I saw and heard at the brothers' meeting, showed unmistakably that righteousness was wanting.<a name=371:20></a> You speak of a 'boastful remark' that a matter such as the one before you at Newcastle would be settled in New York in twenty minutes.<a name=371:21></a> I had no thought of calling attention to New York, for we have our own troubles and there is nothing to boast of.<a name=371:22></a> I might have named many other meetings, only wishing to emphasise by a known form of speech that the 'business' matter (which was the one before us) could ordinarily be quickly disposed of, and why not in Newcastle?<a name=371:23></a> You go on to say that my remark

		viewed by itself.<a name=375:1></a> If a brother or sister is warned and in spite of this contracts marriage with an unconverted person, I have no hesitation in saying that she disqualifies herself for Christian fellowship and should be excluded from it.<a name=375:2></a> While "<i>unbelievers</i>" in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#6:14">2 Corinthians  6:14</a> refers immediately to persons who made no profession of Christianity, the force of the <i>word</i> within the sphere of profession would be the absence of faith and what accompanies this.<a name=375:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Marrying a person known to be a believer, but not recognising fellowship is different, of course, but under certain circumstances not very different.<a name=375:4></a> If the person has had the light presented to him and persistently refuses it, such a union could not be "in the Lord", and so would call for discipline.<a name=375:5></a> The discipline might bring out a state of rebellion which could be met only by withdrawal.<a name=375:6></a> There is always an underlying condition in such cases and the Lord will expose this if the saints are faithful in dealing with them.<a name=375:7></a> One faithful step after another, as seen in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18">Matthew  18</a>, leads to a result according to God.<a name=375:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to <a href="../bible/John.htm#18:16">John  18:16</a>, of course Scripture does not say "the other disciple" was John himself, nor does it say definitely that he wrote the gospel; but internal evidence in the gospel indicates both, especially the latter.<a name=375:9></a> If chapter 18: 16 said, 'the disciple whom Jesus loved', the evidence that it was John would be the same as chapter 21: 24 affords as to his authority of the gospel.<a name=375:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What is to be specially noted is that "the other disciple" <i>followed Jesus with Peter</i> (verse 15); besides the article ('the' ) points to a particular or known disciple and this is in view in John's references to himself throughout the gospel.<a name=375:11></a> Although Judas is mentioned in chapter 18 it is as betrayer, and it is utterly unlikely that the Spirit of God would call him <i>here</i> 'that other disciple' or say that he followed Jesus with Peter.<a name=375:12></a> The omission of the Lord's love for "the other disciple" in this passage corresponds somewhat with chapter 21: 2, where he is just one of Zebedee's sons.<a name=375:13></a> The connections in both instances did not admit of the mention of this love, whereas, it is mentioned in connection with John discerning the Lord (chapter 21: 7).<a name=375:14></a>

		I note in your letter: 'If I say three persons live in a certain road I should at once be asked, What persons do you mean?<a name=384:15></a> What are their names?<a name=384:16></a>' This, I understand, is intended to illustrate that the Divine Persons had names -- the names by which they are now known -- before incarnation.<a name=384:17></a> But there is no human analogy of this great matter, for we cannot say of any man that no one has seen him at any time.<a name=384:18></a> In coming into His creation God has taken names that are <i>relative to it</i>, and obviously we cannot assume that those names applied to Him before there was a creation.<a name=384:19></a> "I AM" is no exception, for it is to convey to the creature mind that God <i>is</i>, which would be unnecessary if no creature existed.<a name=384:20></a> Father and son are terms that in Scripture are first connected with creation.<a name=384:21></a> <i>As so known</i> they are applied to Divine Persons as One of Them became Man.<a name=384:22></a> This is God coming in in love -- taking relationship and names intelligible to the human mind.<a name=384:23></a> To say that they existed before without the thoughts that attach to them, as seen in Scripture -- generation, subjection, etc.<a name=384:24></a> -- is surely not right.<a name=384:25></a> Of course, if Scripture says they did, those who love God will gladly bow to it, but it does not.<a name=384:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards Mr.<a name=384:27></a> P------'s letter, I may say that he wrote me at length and I replied in detail, but he did not acknowledge my letter.<a name=384:28></a> His paper just received reveals a mind running contrary to the scriptural presentation of fatherhood and sonship.<a name=384:29></a> But while his effort is to show that a father and son are necessarily equal, he is obliged to say 'as nearly .<a name=384:30></a>.<a name=384:31></a>.<a name=384:32></a> as possible'.<a name=384:33></a> He says, 'When I call on Brown &amp; Son I would just as soon see the son as the father, other things being equal'.<a name=384:34></a> Thus the firm might as truthfully be called Brown &amp; Father!<a name=384:35></a> Whereas the title of the business implies that Brown is the

	<div class="paragraph">
		father and senior partner.<a name=385:1></a> This surely involves superiority.<a name=385:2></a> He further says, 'When the king cannot attend a function .<a name=385:3></a>.<a name=385:4></a>.<a name=385:5></a> he sends his son .<a name=385:6></a>.<a name=385:7></a>.<a name=385:8></a> his son is himself, only another person'.<a name=385:9></a> This is all contrary to fact.<a name=385:10></a> The king's son, as in his house, is subject to him as a father, and as in the realm he is a subject of the king.<a name=385:11></a> The king is 'supreme' as Peter says.<a name=385:12></a> 'Was Solomon inferior to David?<a name=385:13></a>' Mr.<a name=385:14></a> P------ asks.<a name=385:15></a> He certainly was, for he made him king.<a name=385:16></a> He was superior as his father, as king and by spiritual experience and dignity with God and in the testimony.<a name=385:17></a> That Solomon was king while David lived does not alter this; it involves other typical considerations.<a name=385:18></a> But <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#7:7">Hebrews  7:7</a> settles the matter conclusively.<a name=385:19></a> "Beyond all gainsaying, the inferior is blessed by the better".<a name=385:20></a> Noah, Isaac and Jacob as fathers blessed their sons.<a name=385:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But while our Lord's sonship is regarded in this sense in Scripture, as many well-known passages show, this does not touch His Divine Personality, for He is ever "The Same;" the position of inferiority is <i>taken</i> and not obligatory.<a name=385:22></a> It was morally necessary that He should take the position of subjection in the relation of Son, among other things, that man and his place as in the divine counsels should be fully set out.<a name=385:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mr.<a name=385:24></a> P------'s illustration as to sending serves him no better than the other: 'I send my solicitor' -- 'My' here implies a right of <i>some kind</i> over the solicitor.<a name=385:25></a> It is simply that Mr.<a name=385:26></a> P------ has hired the professional man and so as far as the matter on hand between them goes, he has the right of initiative and direction -- the solicitor is <i>serving</i> him.<a name=385:27></a> Indeed it seems clear that the idea of sending always involves a right or power in the sender over the one sent -- however attenuated or modified it may be or whatever the obligation or motive which induces one to take the position of being sent.<a name=385:28></a>

		Beloved Brother, -- I note your reference to a letter circulated by Mr.<a name=388:7></a> C------.<a name=388:8></a> A copy came from him this week.<a name=388:9></a> I had some correspondence with this brother about three years ago, and I then gathered that he was satisfied with my explanations relative to the statements to which he had objected.<a name=388:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		His letter reveals a mind moving in opposition, based mainly on orthodoxy, to a presentation of a certain feature of the truth.<a name=388:11></a> Almost the whole letter is taken up with what others have said, which shows that, like several that have taken part in the current controversy, his soul in regard of the truth in question is not buttressed in the word of God.<a name=388:12></a> In citing the 'fathers' he ignores that in asserting so-called eternal sonship, they also asserted (as the Creed shows) that our Lord was begotten by His Father before the worlds.<a name=388:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mr.<a name=388:14></a> Darby stands by himself; spiritual instinct is not evidenced in linking him, as this letter does, with Athanasius, Augustine and Luther.<a name=388:15></a> The plane on which Mr.<a name=388:16></a> Darby served, as having judged as contrary to the mind of God the whole clerical system beginning with the early so-called fathers and extending to the present time, was altogether above that of those who preceded him since the apostles went to be with the Lord.<a name=388:17></a> Those who keep the Lord's commandments as loving Him, regard J.<a name=388:18></a>N.<a name=388:19></a>D.<a name=388:20></a> in this way, valuing his ministry as marked by the energy and wisdom of the Spirit; being without an equal since apostolic times.<a name=388:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there have been efforts to make his writings, directly or indirectly, equal with Scripture and this is a most serious matter; the enemy has been in it.<a name=388:22></a> No one would admit that he so regards Mr.<a name=388:23></a> Darby's writings, but the use made of them by many, especially since 1890, conveys that they are final, and this false principle exists in several quarters.<a name=388:24></a> No one, I am sure, would refuse it more strenuously than the great servant himself.<a name=388:25></a> His writings abound with appeals to the Scriptures, as the sole divine test to all teaching.<a name=388:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In a sense nothing has concerned me more in presenting the truth than the plain statements in Mr.<a name=388:27></a> Darby's ministry in support of eternal sonship, especially because I knew how they could be used.<a name=388:28></a> I have constantly owned that it was in his mind in a general way, as an accepted truth.<a name=388:29></a> But it is clear he was not satisfied as to it.<a name=388:30></a> The statement in 'Notes and

		<a name=389>[Page 389]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Comments', Volume 7, page 7, is proof of this, in spite of the effort to neutralise it.<a name=389:1></a> Mr.<a name=389:2></a> Darby weighed it after writing it, fearing, as the 'note' shows, that it might be used to favour Sabellianism, but left it in the text notwithstanding.<a name=389:3></a> Without the note it would lose somewhat of its importance, for it could be said that it was a remark unpublished by the writer, but the note shows that it is his considered statement.<a name=389:4></a> It appears in his meditation on <a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>, as he reaches verse 14 (verse 18 being also in view, as later remarks show).<a name=389:5></a> It is: 'Nor do I see that in this character He is spoken of as Son save as known in the flesh.<a name=389:6></a> He is spoken of previously as the Word, etc.<a name=389:7></a>: now as Son'.<a name=389:8></a> Later (pages 8 and 9) we have what is in keeping with this: 'There is another thing: no man has seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son', the subject now in treatment, 'who is in the bosom of the Father', that is His place, 'He hath declared Him -- this then -- He is, as become flesh .<a name=389:9></a>.<a name=389:10></a>.<a name=389:11></a> the only-begotten Son'.<a name=389:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These remarks have not been brought forward as a basis of what was said at Barnet, for I had not noticed them till many years after I saw more clearly the truth of our Lord's sonship.<a name=389:13></a> I have thought it right to call attention to them because of the use made of J.<a name=389:14></a>N.<a name=389:15></a>D.<a name=389:16></a> on this point by others.<a name=389:17></a> But no unbiased person who carefully reads them will fail to see that Mr.<a name=389:18></a> Darby's mature thoughts bore in the same direction as current teaching amongst us.<a name=389:19></a> His letter as to our Lord being sent into the world (Volume 3, pages 468, 469) shows this also.<a name=389:20></a> It is dated 1881.<a name=389:21></a> Mr.<a name=389:22></a> Darby's remark in the 'note' on page 7, 'Notes and Comments', is not in <i>literal</i> agreement with the text, but obviously should not be used to discredit the latter.<a name=389:23></a> That the writer, after careful examination, allowed the statement to stand should deter us from weakening it.<a name=389:24></a> May we not fairly assume that in view of the clearer light He has afforded on the subject of His sonship, the Lord caused His servant to note down the thoughts I have quoted -- so that other statements of his could not be righteously used against it?<a name=389:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Referring to the details of the letter I am dealing with, I would notice the strange objection to my emphasis on <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10:22">Luke  10:22</a> (in the paper 'Inscrutability' ) because this scripture does not appear on the head of the tract.<a name=389:26></a> In ministry we must be ready to emphasise whatever the Spirit may press on our hearts.<a name=389:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a further strange objection to the remark I made in

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=390>[Page 390]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		this tract as to attaching names to Christ as in absolute Deity -- that 'multitudes of Christians do attach names to Divine Persons in absolute Deity'.<a name=390:1></a> The usage of the multitudes cannot settle anything.<a name=390:2></a> I was referring to Christ in His pre-incarnate form, as is perfectly evident, pointing out the error of applying certain names of Christ viewed as Man to Him viewed in absolute Deity.<a name=390:3></a> The distinction I made was between pre-incarnate Deity and manhood; and of course this distinction could not apply to the Father or the Spirit.<a name=390:4></a> The Father and the Spirit remain in the form of God, and while this is inscrutably absolute, it is also relative.<a name=390:5></a> The titles Father and Spirit ('wind' ) are relative.<a name=390:6></a> Indeed all the names taken by the Divine Persons are relative.<a name=390:7></a> The writer of this letter does not show by what he writes that he distinguishes between the absolute and the relative.<a name=390:8></a> To speak of the Deity apart from its relation to creation we must use the word absolute.<a name=390:9></a> The tract says, 'The truth is to be lifted out of the hands of men and maintained in the hearts of those who love Christ'.<a name=390:10></a> This is wholesome and needed truth; but not so to the writer of the letter, and he ignores what the context clearly shows, that 'men' in my remark referred to theological leaders.<a name=390:11></a> The truth is, alas, in their hands for many Christians even now.<a name=390:12></a> I have no hesitation in saying that one who can treat the teaching of page 8 of the tract, as the writer of the letter does, is not with God, but on the contrary is refusing practical and essential truth.<a name=390:13></a> He is trifling with divine things in asking (in large letters), 'Has the truth been in the hands of those who are not lovers of Christ until 1929'(Barnet Readings).<a name=390:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Those who took part in those readings recognise as much as the writer of this letter does, the revival of a hundred years ago, and there is not the slightest hint to the contrary in the readings.<a name=390:15></a> Besides, what he is objecting to is only a phase of 'the truth'.<a name=390:16></a> Also it is stated in the Barnet notes that what they contain as to Christ's sonship was learnt through Mr.<a name=390:17></a> Raven, who fell asleep through Jesus, many years before.<a name=390:18></a> We see in this question of his how the writer's mind runs in the current of false accusation.<a name=390:19></a> The whole letter is of a sinister character; not only is there opposition to the truth but an evident effort to influence others against it.<a name=390:20></a> The Lord will surely have to say to all this, especially in one nominally (as I understand) in fellowship with us.<a name=390:21></a> May he recover himself from the snare of the devil.<a name=390:22></a>

		The pamphlet from Ayr, which you sent, advances the principle that the ministry of a previous generation is the test of a current one.<a name=392:5></a> What has the stamp of a ministry of the Spirit at any time will, of course, agree <i>generally</i> with such ministry at other times, but to make the teaching of uninspired men a standard is false and pernicious, as placing it on the level of Scripture, the only true standard.<a name=392:6></a> No one would admit that he regards such teaching in this way, but while not formally stated, evil is implied in the manner in which the earlier ministry is used.<a name=392:7></a> Quotations from Scripture are meagre, whole pamphlets being almost made up of quotations from servants who ministered to a past generation.<a name=392:8></a> Were one inconversant with Christianity, to read most of the papers I am referring to, he could not but assume that its late teachers are regarded as more authoritative than those of the beginning.<a name=392:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As you will know, I am not questioning that the ministry of the servants mentioned in the main, was of the Spirit.<a name=392:10></a> I am writing of the use made of it.<a name=392:11></a> For instance, this pamphlet from Ayr has 22 pages, and in only three of them is there any attempt made to bring in the <i>direct</i> teaching of the Scriptures.<a name=392:12></a> I have no hesitation in saying that one who premises mainly on writings other than Scripture is disqualified to deal with divine things and has no moral right to address the people of God.<a name=392:13></a> He is not speaking "as oracles of God".<a name=392:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another feature marking some of the papers dealing with the Lord's sonship is the placing of Mr.<a name=392:15></a> Darby along with Mr.<a name=392:16></a> W.<a name=392:17></a> Kelly and Mr.<a name=392:18></a> F.<a name=392:19></a> W.<a name=392:20></a> Grant.<a name=392:21></a> It is well known that J.<a name=392:22></a>N.<a name=392:23></a>D.<a name=392:24></a> had serious conflict with the former and that he refused the views of the latter as to the Spirit and eternal life.<a name=392:25></a> There is a moral defect shown in grouping the servant whom God so honoured and who continued faithful to the end, with men who divided the saints in turning away from the truth.<a name=392:26></a> We also find Mr.<a name=392:27></a> Raven quoted as supporting 'eternal sonship' although the writers, as having read the Barnet Notes, must be aware that in his later ministry he refused it.<a name=392:28></a> Thus a moral defect in them appears here also.<a name=392:29></a>

		Those active in it, doubtless, do not mean to weaken Scripture; they assert that Scripture alone is authoritative, but the constant profuse citation of writings other than Scripture, overshadowing the latter, is, by <i>implication</i>, leaven which works in the minds of credulous readers, and the authority of the inspired word is weakened.<a name=393:1></a> The enemy is unmistakably in this.<a name=393:2></a> The statement (often given out of its contextual meaning) of an honoured servant is accepted as final and thus the soul is robbed of the gain of arriving at the truth, as seeking prayerfully the direct teaching of Scripture as to the subject in question.<a name=393:3></a> His soul would be tested by the word of God, which is sharper than any two-edged sword; he would not only acquire a clear view of the truth in question, but also an increased knowledge of God.<a name=393:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I need not say that I am far from discrediting the previous delivering and constructive ministry of the last century.<a name=393:5></a> I owe too much to it under God to do this.<a name=393:6></a> It marked a great movement of the Spirit; but this movement continues, and so the word is, "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies".<a name=393:7></a> Those working with God today will gladly own the distinction God gave Mr.<a name=393:8></a> Darby and others of an earlier day, but they will not, cannot, admit that the ministry of the last century was final, or that the Holy Spirit has ceased to speak.<a name=393:9></a> Indeed no one would refuse more vehemently than Mr.<a name=393:10></a> Darby any such suggestion.<a name=393:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards ministry, the most advanced and honoured of those who have part in it would never abandon the <i>learning</i> attitude; and so constant adjustment goes on.<a name=393:12></a> Thus a servant's later ministry may in <i>detail</i> vary from what he presented earlier.<a name=393:13></a> This may be seen in Mr.<a name=393:14></a> Darby's writings.<a name=393:15></a> That he held and urged the eternal sonship of Christ as an accepted truth is true, but that he was satisfied with it in his later years is more than questionable.<a name=393:16></a> 'Notes and Comments', Volume 7, page 7, affords undoubted proof of this.<a name=393:17></a> Great efforts have been made to neutralise it, but his statement, 'Nor do I see that in this character He is spoken of as Son save as known in the flesh' stands.<a name=393:18></a> The 'note' makes this statement specially important, for it shows that the writer <i>reconsidered</i> it fearing that it might be used to favour Sabellianism, as like statements today are alleged to do.<a name=393:19></a> The note indicates that Mr.<a name=393:20></a> Darby had not committed himself to the full significance of the text, but that he left the latter unaltered

		As to Mr.<a name=394:14></a> Raven -- whom the Ayr paper quotes in support of eternal sonship -- it is well known that his mind became altered as to it.<a name=394:15></a> Besides myself, there are many witnesses to his refusal of it, say from 1898 to the end of his service.<a name=394:16></a> It is also a fact that Mr.<a name=394:17></a> Reid in a magazine article in 1878 -- four years before Mr.<a name=394:18></a> Darby's death -- questioned the scripturalness of eternal sonship.<a name=394:19></a> There is no evidence that it was denounced as an error.<a name=394:20></a> These remarks are not made merely to support the truth as I understand it, but to show the misleading character of the current profuse reproduction of the writings of the Lord's servants no longer with us.<a name=394:21></a>

		As to myself, the excerpts furnished in page 5 of the Ayr pamphlet to show that I held earlier as to sonship the opposite of what I hold now fails of the object intended.<a name=394:27></a> In using the designation "Son" in the older ones I simply meant to convey the <i>Person</i>.<a name=394:28></a> In using a title or name applying to our Lord as Man to designate Him before He became Man I followed scriptural example: e.<a name=394:29></a>g.<a name=394:30></a>, "Christ Jesus; who, subsisting in the form of God".<a name=394:31></a> It is over thirty years since the Scriptural untenableness of the term 'eternal sonship' became fixed in my mind, and while the truth of the Lord's sonship is much clearer to me now than it was then, I cannot find that I have said or written anything inconsistent with what I held.<a name=394:32></a>

		As regards linking the ark with the Lord's supper, it has ever to be borne in mind that the latter is a <i>memorial</i>, also food, in a scene out of which Christ has been rejected and from which He is thus absent.<a name=396:14></a> These facts should ever be present and <i>dwelt</i> upon by us as gathered to eat the Lord's supper.<a name=396:15></a> It is thus properly in the wilderness.<a name=396:16></a> In the types <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#32">Exodus  32</a>- 34 answers to it -- these chapters are full of instruction.<a name=396:17></a> The ark is <i>not</i> there.<a name=396:18></a> At the end of Exodus, the tabernacle being set up, the ark thus in its place, the glory comes in and <i>Moses</i> cannot enter.<a name=396:19></a> <i>Movement</i> is immediately in view, but not by the ark going before but by the <i>cloud</i>.<a name=396:20></a> The thought of <i>authority</i> gives place to the general thought of the glory, movement and guidance being connected with the latter.<a name=396:21></a> But when actual movement begins, the ark, of itself, so to speak, takes the lead (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#10">Numbers  10</a>).<a name=396:22></a> This leads to Canaan; but note that the ark is connected with conflict, including death -- Jordan -- and that it is not mentioned after the people enter the land until Jericho is to be taken.<a name=396:23></a> In <a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#4:19">Joshua  4:19</a> and 5: 12 our resurrection with Christ is in view, and with this position <a href="../bible/1and.htm#2">1 and  2</a>Chronicles must be connected to get the full thought of the assembly.<a name=396:24></a> Thus as partaking of the Supper we are <i>here</i> and Christ is <i>there</i> -- in heaven.<a name=396:25></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is wise to consult nearby meetings, especially as circumstances are so unusual and general fellowship must be in view in arranging for special meetings.<a name=397:8></a> But while it is wise, as promoting confidence and unity, for you to take counsel with a nearby meeting, it will be equally wise for it to defer to the exercises of those immediately responsible.<a name=397:9></a> However sure I may be of the rightness of my judgment it is never right to impose it on those who are directly and immediately responsible.<a name=397:10></a> A father may be correct in his judgment of something pertaining to the house of his son or daughter, but wisdom will restrain him from insisting on it -- the separate institution is immediately responsible.<a name=397:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The main question now for you at Highland Park to decide is whether you have faith for the undertaking, and of course faith is not mere theoretic assumption but based upon the knowledge of God in the soul.<a name=397:12></a> In matters of the kind under consideration it is accompanied by experimental knowledge of God.<a name=397:13></a>

		As to <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11">1 Corinthians  11</a>and 14, it is to be noted that in the former the word 'whole' is omitted, but it appears in chapter 14: 23.<a name=397:19></a> Moreover, the article is rightly left out before "assembly" in chapter 11: 18.<a name=397:20></a> Thus chapter 11 is assembling <i>characteristically;</i> "one place" being, as you say, in contrast

		But I am afraid trouble will arise from the statement on page 8, paragraph 2 -- 'Never acted as on equality with God'.<a name=398:20></a> I doubt that it can be sustained.<a name=398:21></a> What our Lord says in <a href="../bible/John.htm#5">John  5</a>, quoted in the previous paragraph, <i>literally</i> supports the statement, but we must it seems to me, read this with <i>other</i> statements.<a name=398:22></a> He is still Man, but yet "over all God".<a name=398:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Also page 8, paragraph 3 -- 'Never departed from the place which is suitable to a Son with a Father'.<a name=398:24></a> I do not think we should say anything indicating that He had not the liberty of acting <i>as God</i>.<a name=398:25></a>

		Page 9 -- 'His eternal Person as in Deity is greater than anything which attaches to Him as viewed in the place and relationship of Son'.<a name=398:26></a> As said above, although Man He is said to be "God" -- "the true God".<a name=398:27></a>

		You could, perhaps, say something like this -- 'Although ever remaining, as to His Person, in the inscrutableness of Deity, and retaining liberty to act in it, He had taken a subordinate place as Son, for the effectuation of the Divine thoughts, and He maintained it throughout'.<a name=399:4></a> Here <a href="../bible/John.htm#5">John  5</a>could be brought in as setting forth equality in subjection; for while He says the Son can do nothing of Himself, etc.<a name=399:5></a>, He says, "That all may honour the Son even as they honour the Father".<a name=399:6></a> Also, "Whatever things <i>He</i> does, these things also the Son does <i>in like manner</i>".<a name=399:7></a> There is wonderful interweaving of His personal dignity and subjection to and dependence on the Father.<a name=399:8></a> As you remark, we must think as Scripture does, and this is nowhere more needed than in <a href="../bible/John.htm#5">John  5</a>and <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#13">Mark  13</a>.<a name=399:9></a>

		August 4th, 1933.<a name=400:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Beloved Brother, -- As promised, during our recent conversation, I now send you the following remarks on the tract entitled 'The Divine Sonship of the Lord Jesus Christ'.<a name=400:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The tract is based upon the statement that 'He is God in His eternal Nature.<a name=400:3></a> And His sonship, which subsists in that eternal Nature, must be itself eternal' (page 5).<a name=400:4></a> There is also the further statement on the same page, 'This sonship .<a name=400:5></a>.<a name=400:6></a>.<a name=400:7></a> must subsist in His own eternal Divine Nature'.<a name=400:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Note the phrase 'eternal Divine Nature' -- the last word written with a capital.<a name=400:9></a> Where is it obtained from?<a name=400:10></a> In the tract it appears (in several forms) something like 120 times applied to the Divine Persons as in absolute Deity.<a name=400:11></a> Scripture employs the expression "divine nature" but once (<a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#1:4">2 Peter  1:4</a>), to teach that believers partake of it.<a name=400:12></a> The tract uses the expression in a sense that is not scriptural, for otherwise it would make us partakers of Deity.<a name=400:13></a> Thus a scriptural expression used in the tract unscripturally is made the basis of its teaching!<a name=400:14></a> In this manifestly wrong way is the so-called eternal sonship of Christ sought to be maintained by the writer of this tract.<a name=400:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Of course the tract assumes to support its teaching by Scripture, and so, in part one, five passages are adduced from the gospel of John.<a name=400:16></a> The first is <a href="../bible/John.htm#5:21">John  5:21</a>.<a name=400:17></a> Much that is said of this verse could be accepted if presented apart unscriptural intent indicated above.<a name=400:18></a> But there is nothing here to show the pre-incarnate sonship of Christ.<a name=400:19></a> The chapter teaches the personal equality of the Son with the Father, but also that, in sonship, He has <i>taken a place</i> of inferiority in subjection to the Father.<a name=400:20></a> The writer of the tract vainly endeavours to shut this fact out of verse 21, by saying, 'Neither does the scripture say here that He receives this from the Father, as in verse 26'.<a name=400:21></a> Scripture need not always repeat itself; but on this matter of our Lord's sonship it teaches throughout that, while He is personally equal with the Father, He has in it taken a subject place -- the relationship of Son implying this.<a name=400:22></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#5:19">John  5:19</a>, 20, that is to say, immediately preceding the verse quoted in the tract, this truth is stated in the plainest manner, but while verse 21 indicates our Lord's deity, it cannot be used to deny the subject place He has taken as Son.<a name=400:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'He exercises His own will because He is Son' (page 6).<a name=400:24></a> Why '<i>because</i> He is Son'?<a name=400:25></a> The truth is that He exercises it
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=401>[Page 401]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		as a <i>Divine Person</i>.<a name=401:1></a> Then we have stated the truth (?<a name=401:2></a>) assumed to be arrived at: 'Here, then, is shown forth the sonship of Jesus as <i>that in which lies</i> the right and power in quickening of Divine Sovereignty'.<a name=401:3></a> Note, 'Sonship .<a name=401:4></a>.<a name=401:5></a>.<a name=401:6></a> <i>that in which lies</i> the right and power in quickening of Divine Sovereignty'.<a name=401:7></a> But the Father quickens, as the verse states, and sonship is not in Him.<a name=401:8></a> The Spirit quickens also.<a name=401:9></a> Scripture teaches that the right and power referred to lies in Divine Persons -- in God -- not necessarily in sonship.<a name=401:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next Scripture brought forward is <a href="../bible/John.htm#8:14">John  8:14</a>, the 'tremendous significance' of which, according to the tract, nothing could exceed.<a name=401:11></a> Like all statements of our Lord's deity, it is of course of great importance; but in it the Lord points out His competency to witness of Himself, as He knew whence He came and whither He was going.<a name=401:12></a> His adversaries did <i>not</i> know.<a name=401:13></a> He is a Divine Person, saying later on, "Before Abraham was, I am", and so knew whence He came.<a name=401:14></a> But the Lord's words are not enough for the tract, for we read (page 6), 'This marvellous conscious knowledge lies in His eternal Divine Nature'.<a name=401:15></a> The truth taught in the chapter is that the knowledge referred to speaks of His deity.<a name=401:16></a> Again (page 7), 'Thus, His knowledge of His own eternal place with the Father lay in the holy consciousness of His Divine Nature'.<a name=401:17></a> Note here the use of 'Divine Nature' where Person should be employed -- if indeed we are justified in speaking of Divine Persons in this way.<a name=401:18></a> To my mind the statement I quote is irreverent and presumptuous.<a name=401:19></a> How does the writer know that the infinite knowledge a Divine Person has lies in His 'Divine Nature'?<a name=401:20></a> What divine nature is he speaking of?<a name=401:21></a> It cannot be that of which Scripture speaks (<a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#1">2 Peter  1</a>-- enlarged on in <a href="../bible/1John.htm#4">1 John  4</a>) in which we have part.<a name=401:22></a> He must have in mind what God is essentially as in absoluteness.<a name=401:23></a> Does the writer know what this is?<a name=401:24></a> Certainly not; God's form and essential Being are altogether beyond us.<a name=401:25></a> Nature is not essential being or form.<a name=401:26></a> This is true, even when applied to a creature.<a name=401:27></a> We speak of God's nature being love, as seen in Christ, but this does not refer to His Form or essential Being; and we cannot say 'love is God'.<a name=401:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'For that Nature remained in His Incarnation .<a name=401:29></a>.<a name=401:30></a>.<a name=401:31></a> though having united to it His holy sinless Nature as Man, in His ONE eternal Person' (page 7).<a name=401:32></a> The reader will note the confusion of thought in this statement.<a name=401:33></a> <i>In</i> our Lord's 'ONE

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/John.htm#10:30">John  10:30</a> is the next scripture under review -- "I and the Father are one".<a name=402:3></a> The Lord is asserting the perfect unity between the Father and Himself, applying this fact to Their service, having said that His Father was greater than all.<a name=402:4></a> But the tract must, as usual, introduce 'Divine Nature'.<a name=402:5></a> The passage, like so many others, asserts the Lord's deity, as the Jews understood (verse 33), but why base this on the 'Divine Nature', a misused expression as already pointed out?<a name=402:6></a> Page 8 says, 'Thus, as the Son, He claims this oneness with the Father by virtue of that eternal Divine Nature which was His, even as it was the Father's'.<a name=402:7></a> Where does He claim oneness with the Father 'by virtue of that eternal Divine Nature which was His?<a name=402:8></a>' The statement is gratuitous, and obviously, is made to fortify the unscriptural basis -- 'eternal Divine Nature' -- on which the teaching of the tract rests.<a name=402:9></a> The Lord, in the passage, claims oneness with the Father being a Divine Person, the Jews understanding by it that He made Himself God.<a name=402:10></a> In the presence of the foregoing consideration of what the tract calls 'simple yet evident facts', you will know how to regard the question asked at the bottom of page 7.<a name=402:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Of <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:5">John  17:5</a>, the tract says (page 8), that the glory of which the Lord speaks is a <i>condition</i> proper to its (Godhead glory) manifestation on high.<a name=402:12></a> How does the writer know this?<a name=402:13></a> 'He had the right', the tract says (page 8), 'being the Divine Son, to ask to be glorified again with that glory'.<a name=402:14></a> Why not say, 'Being a Divine Person'?<a name=402:15></a> As a Divine Person He is God, which is manifestly greater than sonship.<a name=402:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'His Person is not complete without that (Divine) Nature', (page 9).<a name=402:17></a> Do not these constant references to the 'Divine Nature' indicate an obsession of spirit on the part of the writer?<a name=402:18></a> A Divine Person <i>must</i> be complete.<a name=402:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, 'In that eternal Nature lay those ineffable affections.<a name=402:20></a> They had their source in that Nature' (page 9).<a name=402:21></a> They had their source the <i>Persons</i>.<a name=402:22></a>

		We reached New York on Lord's Day and so did not have the privilege of the breaking of bread but we attended the gospel meeting.<a name=404:21></a> Nee had to remain on board until Monday morning as he had no U.<a name=404:22></a>S.<a name=404:23></a>A.<a name=404:24></a> visa.<a name=404:25></a> We had a good voyage, although two days were somewhat rough.<a name=404:26></a> My wife was poorly one of the days and she had a bad day from headache since our arrival, but she is quite well now, thank God.<a name=404:27></a> The voyage did us all good, especially myself.<a name=404:28></a> We found all well here and interest in the truth very good.<a name=404:29></a> There was a very large meeting on Tuesday at which Nee spoke.<a name=404:30></a> Considering everything, I thought the word good, although some things said had doubtful significance.<a name=404:31></a> On Wednesday there were fellowship meetings at Westfield -- an address in the evening by Nee.<a name=404:32></a> Many thought it <i>more</i> than wonderful, but the <i>doctrine</i> distressed me.<a name=404:33></a> It was on deliverance, and Nee showed that he has a system of

		teaching of his own, as I may say, on <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>, 7 and 8.<a name=405:1></a> As he was free on the steamer he made known many things as to his belief and conditions generally in the meetings in China.<a name=405:2></a> His understanding as to prophecy is quite unscriptural -- surprisingly so, as he has a general knowledge of what has been delivered to the saints by those who were taught of God.<a name=405:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus the whole position in China is most precarious, as Nee is by far the most influential among the brethren there.<a name=405:4></a> My comfort is that the Lord has heard His people during several years as to the movement in that land, and I am assured He will stand by them now.<a name=405:5></a> He will make a way for us.<a name=405:6></a> In the meantime it is for us to watch and pray more intently.<a name=405:7></a>

		Last week I heard from Mr.<a name=406:30></a> Percy Lyon that Nee had broken bread with an independent company of Christians in London, which he admits.<a name=406:31></a> Then he went to the country last Thursday, to spend a few days with Dr.<a name=406:32></a> S------ and his family.<a name=406:33></a> These are the people among others that Nee came to this country specially to see.<a name=406:34></a> I urged Nee to break bread in some of our meetings on the Lord's Day, but on his return yesterday, he
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=407>[Page 407]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		told me, as I enquired from him, that he broke bread with the S------ family, and some others.<a name=407:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Some of the brothers in New York, myself included, entered into this sad development with Nee.<a name=407:2></a> He said finally that he regretted what he had done, that he should have told the brethren beforehand, but he made no admission of violation of principles.<a name=407:3></a> He said the brothers who visited China last year had agreed that the Chinese brethren should be free to receive such Christians as Dr.<a name=407:4></a> S------, <i>as</i> Christians.<a name=407:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We, the brothers who met Nee yesterday, said we could understand this, but that we were assured that no such situation as his action in London, and New Haven, where he broke bread last Lord's Day, could have been contemplated.<a name=407:6></a> He admitted this.<a name=407:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		His view on prophecy came into our conversation.<a name=407:8></a> We had spoken much of this on the steamer.<a name=407:9></a> He thinks <i>some</i> of the saints will not be taken to Himself, by the Lord, at the rapture, that they will go through 'tribulation'.<a name=407:10></a> He also said on the steamer that the language of the book of Revelation was <i>literal</i>, not symbolical, for instance, the "gold" in the heavenly city is literal.<a name=407:11></a> The city thus has a corruptible element in it.<a name=407:12></a> I pointed this glaring error out to Nee, but he did not seem to take any note of it.<a name=407:13></a> What makes his erroneous prophetic views seem more serious is that the person through whom he was converted, a woman, taught him, as he told me yesterday, something on prophecy, according to what is generally accepted by the saints, so that he has given up truth for error.<a name=407:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You can understand my sorrow, because of what has come to light, especially as Nee and ourselves got on very well on the boat.<a name=407:15></a> He was free, and made much general inquiry.<a name=407:16></a> He was received here with the greatest affection.<a name=407:17></a> He addressed one of the largest meetings held here.<a name=407:18></a> Considering everything the address was good, but the next night at Westfield, an address on deliverance, disclosed much that was misleading in the way of doctrine.<a name=407:19></a> This, however, was not noticed by many.<a name=407:20></a> His personality and ability eclipsed all else.<a name=407:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The attitude we take up here, having talked matters over with Nee, is to assume that the whole Chinese position is still in the tentative or learning stage, and that it should be left for the moment entirely in the Lord's hands.<a name=407:22></a>

		Beloved Brother, -- I appreciate much the information you sent as to the special meetings at Vancouver.<a name=411:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, I wish to explain that your last telegram reached me in Detroit, as I had left for the meetings there before it arrived here -- my wife telephoned it to me on the Saturday evening, and I sent my answer at once.<a name=411:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am thankful you regard it as confirmatory of the decision you and others had reached before it arrived.<a name=411:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Your experience with Mr.<a name=411:14></a> Nee corresponds with ours and generally with what I saw and heard in Great Britain.<a name=411:15></a> It seems to me that the attitude brethren here and in Vancouver have taken is generally the only one the circumstances admitted of, and there can be no doubt that our brethren in Great Britain, Australia, and elsewhere will agree.<a name=411:16></a> Technically, so to speak, it should have been different, for no brother would ordinarily be allowed to break bread and minister among us who behaved himself as Nee did.<a name=411:17></a> But the large number of saints in China who as to fellowship do not know their right hand from their left, who hang on Nee's words, required that he should be handled tenderly -- that is, on the principle of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#14">Romans  14</a>and <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#11">Acts  11</a>and <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#1:19">Exodus  1:19</a>.<a name=411:18></a> A formal refusal of Nee would probably end in a breach with all now nominally in fellowship with us there.<a name=411:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the situation is serious in the extreme, for it is the case of a brother in fellowship -- nominally -- with us and hailed with delight because, no doubt, of his personality, ability and nationality -- by the many among us, and yet holding principles which are subversive of the ground we, through grace, occupy, and for which our late leaders suffered so as to recover and maintain them.<a name=411:20></a> The attitude therefore taken by yourselves

		and those in New York can only be regarded as of a tentative nature, for Mr.<a name=412:1></a> Nee's doing and principles, if endorsed by those in Shanghai and elsewhere in China, will render fellowship with them impossible.<a name=412:2></a> How great is the need of being cast on the Lord as to this unprecedented I may say, situation!<a name=412:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am most thankful that you, Dr.<a name=412:4></a> P.<a name=412:5></a> and others were enabled to speak so faithfully to our brother.<a name=412:6></a> You covered the same ground with him largely that we covered, and it is disappointing to note that his answers or comments are the same as he made here, especially as to 2 John -- showing that he is not accepting the plainest teaching as to fellowship.<a name=412:7></a> But the word of God is like a fire, like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces, and so during the long voyage our brother may think over with a conscience what has been presented to him by many witnesses with the greatly-wished-for result.<a name=412:8></a> He told us he would not say anything as to his judgment of what was urged on him here until he took counsel with his brethren in China.<a name=412:9></a>

		district, especially as I have already had part in a consideration of the matter.<a name=415:1></a> It is indeed complicated and requires wisdom from above in those who are affected by it, so that love and peace may prevail.<a name=415:2></a> In Joshua the boundaries of the tribes were irregular and this, no doubt, was with divine intent -- love would be tested and increased as exercised by the difficulties involved.<a name=415:3></a> But we are children of wisdom and should know when there should be mercy and not sacrifice.<a name=415:4></a> On the other hand, we are <i>priests</i> -- those who are, so to speak, to know and enforce 'the law'.<a name=415:5></a> If sacrifice is required from you it is not for you to demand mercy, but if mercy (as seen in God) makes the sacrifice unnecessary, then the demand for it (the sacrifice) should cease.<a name=415:6></a> The fact that your house is actually within the boundary line of Auckland cannot, as far as I see, justify your being required to walk two and a half miles past the nearest meeting-room to get to another.<a name=415:7></a>

		As regards administration, this hinges on your being of the assembly in the place -- Mount Eden.<a name=415:8></a> You are one of the assembly in a general sense, a member of Christ's body, and if (according to what I wrote above) you should be free to break bread at Woodside Road room you are eligible to have part in all assembly matters in Mount Eden.<a name=415:9></a> Added to the other facts, your business interests being in Mount Eden is of importance.<a name=415:10></a> Besides, the idea of the <i>neighbour</i> (other facts being as mentioned) confirms that Mount Eden is the place of your local responsibility.<a name=415:11></a> Thus the procedure you mention (as to the case of discipline) which assumed that the service of the four brothers who visited the brother in question was invalid can hardly be justified.<a name=415:12></a> On the ground of <i>general</i> fellowship (to which I alluded above) and on the ground that the four brothers broke bread in Mount Eden (as I understand) they were (being <i>personally</i> suitable) eligible for the service.<a name=415:13></a> To exclude a <i>visiting</i> brother (unless for some personal disqualification) from part in local assembly matters is not scriptural as far as I understand, on the other hand, a wise visiting brother would not interfere in local affairs save as his brethren made way for him.<a name=415:14></a> The procedure you mention which required the sisters (all being gathered for administrative action) to leave because you assumed technical discrepancy so that the brothers should depute two of their number to see the brother under discipline, seems to me unwarranted.<a name=415:15></a> The point the apostle makes in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5">1 Corinthians  5</a>in this respect is

		As to this I would say that as the breaking of bread in a locality involves the truth of the assembly there, we should look for someone corresponding with the "angel" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2:1">Revelation  2:1</a>).<a name=416:27></a> From what you write of Zangger, confirmed fully by the spirit and tone of his letter to me, I judge he is one of sufficient intelligence and integrity to be regarded as trustworthy as accepting responsibility before the Lord.<a name=416:28></a> If all there are assured in faith and free to break bread at Venice, it seems to me they should do so, and I am assured the Lord would be with them.<a name=416:29></a> Indeed they would thus afford peculiar joy to Him as owning Him and His assembly in that dark, Jezebel-ridden land.<a name=416:30></a> Of course, they would acquaint the brethren in Milan and elsewhere in Italy of their purpose before breaking bread so as to insure <i>general</i> fellowship.<a name=416:31></a>

		The case at Como would be necessarily governed by the state of the sisters there.<a name=417:4></a> If they are at all such as A------, who had a good report without, I think there might be the breaking of bread on the occasion of a brother, or brothers, visiting them.<a name=417:5></a> The principle of the 'angel' or the acceptance of local responsibility is there.<a name=417:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe the Lord is deeply interested in these dear ones, surrounded, as they are, by so much gross darkness, and would support them in a special way, as His addresses to the churches indicate.<a name=417:7></a> Where there is intelligence and integrity the sense of responsibility to the Lord steadies and helps believers.<a name=417:8></a> There is evidence of this on this side of the Atlantic, where there are many small and isolated meetings.<a name=417:9></a>

		Wisdom among us would localise a difficulty of this kind as much as possible, but one of such magnitude as that at Newcastle cannot be wisely left in the hands of one meeting, especially if there are natural or other personal links apt to cause bias.<a name=418:2></a> It is <i>in principle of general</i> import and hence an advantage is gained in brothers of wisdom and experience from all neighbouring meetings being free to take counsel together as before the Lord so that He might guide to a righteous solution of the sorrow.<a name=418:3></a>

		On the other hand, those who stood loyal to Christ and the principles governing the house of God, especially as to fellowship, refusing Bethesda's principles and conduct, have been steadily blessed of God in a gracious ministry of the Spirit given through and to them -- a steady stream through all the years which have elapsed, and it still goes on.<a name=429:3></a> The truth as to Christ and the assembly, eternal life, the gospel of the glory of God, the service of God in the assembly, fellowship, and more recently, of the absolute and relative features of the Persons of the Holy Trinity -- indeed the whole system of truth has been coming before the saints with a clearness and definiteness unknown since apostolic days.<a name=429:4></a> The evidence of this is, of course, more apparent through those whom the Holy Spirit used, but any one who has not had this privilege may readily verify it by examining the written ministry of the period mentioned.<a name=429:5></a> What I am writing is no question of boasting in men -- God forbid -- but of owning and showing what God has done in honouring His own truth and those who, having His commandments, keep them.<a name=429:6></a> I am not, of course, ignoring that sorrowful things have happened through human unfaithfulness, but I speak of what God has done in relation to the maintenance of His own principles.<a name=429:7></a>

		Latitude allowed to persons breaking bread to retain their links with human religious organisations, and others of a worldly nature, may give you larger numbers, as is witnessed among 'Open Brethren', but it involves the spirit of the world and material unsuited for assembly formation -- a state of things that the Lord cannot identify Himself with and in which the Holy Spirit will not have liberty to operate.<a name=429:9></a> 2 Timothy is <i>especially</i> the scripture for our day as regulating us in reference to Christendom as it is, and the "seal" there

		One important principle is that the assembly, or rather the saints, have authority to remit as they have to retain sins, <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:23">John  20:23</a>.<a name=431:3></a> Thus, your enquiry will be, is the sin thoroughly bottomed in true contrition as before God?<a name=431:4></a> Is there the sense that God has thus forgiven?<a name=431:5></a> To reach a safe conclusion as to this it will be necessary to determine whether the beginning of the sin was just what you mention, or was there anything of the kind earlier?<a name=431:6></a> Was the nervous breakdown because of this <i>one</i> offence?<a name=431:7></a> Was there anything like such a breakdown before; if so, was this last one coming on when the sin occurred?<a name=431:8></a> Was the confession wholly voluntary?<a name=431:9></a> or was the motive in confession partially or wholly because of the likelihood of the matter becoming known anyway?<a name=431:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		According to <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#13">Leviticus  13</a>, the saints, as priests, are qualified to reach a true conclusion, and if it is certain that the leprosy has ceased to act, being not the outcome of an old unjudged root, and that the offender is free from, or superior to, the state that led to it, being conscious of forgiveness by God, according to <a href="../bible/1John.htm#1">1 John  1</a>and 2, the saints may righteously have recourse to their prerogative of forgiveness, and hence there will be no need of public action.<a name=431:11></a> The saints are already sitting in judgment in the matter and the offender is voluntarily at their bar, as it were, and so what they do, as seeking to act for God, to maintain, on the one hand, the holiness of His house, and, on the other, to maintain the reign of grace -- as in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:34">Luke  24:34</a>, the appearing to Simon -- under these circumstances heaven will ratify what they do.<a name=431:12></a>

		The London brothers may point out to you that the Lord ministered the word to <i>all</i> that came to Him -- sometimes they blocked even the door -- although He addressed His own as "Little flock;" that while He appeared after He rose from the dead to Peter and James severally, He also "appeared to above 500 brethren at once" -- an important point, as referring to what is specially spiritual, which you would limit to twenty or so apparently; and you say, 'No note taking:' This does not seem fair.<a name=432:14></a> Notes of Edinburgh meetings circulate to the extent of 8,000 - 10,000 -- does this not indicate that they contain some food for the household, which the Lord values?<a name=432:15></a> What right has anyone to say nay to it?<a name=432:16></a> Also that Paul contemplates <i>all</i> the saints at Corinth coming together in one place for ministry: These latter two facts being specially important as appearing m an epistle that treats of outward order; then

		Beloved Brother, -- I omitted to allude to the report of what I said as to no sweet savour for God in a public announcement of judgment reached as to one convicted of sin; I hardly remember saying this, but no doubt I did and would have referred to <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#5:15">Numbers  5:15</a>; for <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5">1 Corinthians  5</a>should not be brought into chapter 11: 18; a special meeting should be called for this.<a name=438:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Since writing I thought it well to read your letter on discipline.<a name=438:7></a> It seems to me somewhat misleading.<a name=438:8></a> Certainly the following is: 'I believe mere separating from wicked persons is unrighteousness, for it is not maintaining in integrity the commandment laid down for us'.<a name=438:9></a> As it stands, that statement is a contradiction of <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2">2 Timothy  2</a>and <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#16:26">Numbers  16:26</a>, 27.<a name=438:10></a> You may say vessels to dishonour are not wicked persons; but they may hold and teach the worst kind of error and hence they (or at least some of them) are wicked.<a name=438:11></a> Certainly Korah and his band were wicked.<a name=438:12></a> Moses enjoins the assembly to depart from the tents of "these wicked men".<a name=438:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On a later page (pages are not numbered) you say: 'So that in the execution of the judgment arrived at we can only decide for ourselves that we separate from such, as departing from one identified with iniquity'.<a name=438:14></a> This and the other statement are opposed to each other.<a name=438:15></a> To your mind it may be the reference to an 'execution of a judgment arrived at' cancels the inconsistency but 'separating from wicked persons' (first statement) must be 'the execution of a judgment arrived at'.<a name=438:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before and after the first statement you elaborate the view that one must 'carry out' every commandment of Scripture -- that if we cannot carry out the commandment to put away a wicked person how can we carry out the other commandments of 1 Corinthians including the Lord's supper?<a name=438:17></a> Thus clearly in the first statement I quoted, you condemn separating from wicked persons as unrighteousness, being substituted for putting away, the latter being the commandment.<a name=438:18></a> Whereas later, as I pointed out, you say separation from wicked persons is the right ground to take.<a name=438:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It seems to me that generally, the second part of the letter cancels the first part, leaving your readers (if they can forget the early section) with what is in the main what brethren generally understand as the truth governing the matter considered.<a name=438:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=439>[Page 439]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But I do not think this is how the letter will be regarded by all who read it.<a name=439:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The letter fails to make due allowance for the great difference between original and remnant conditions.<a name=439:2></a> This is not only in 'modifications of language and of the scope of operations' but in direct divine disallowance to the remnant of normal assembly status -- <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2:24">Revelation  2:24</a> to end and chapter 3.<a name=439:3></a> Philadelphia has a little power and is generally owned because of an approved state (which could only be in comparatively a few) but the general position, beginning with the remnant in Thyatira, remains unchanged.<a name=439:4></a> The instructed can discern that the church is in the Lord's mind, but He is not <i>holding</i> the seven stars.<a name=439:5></a> <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:19">Matthew  18:19</a>, 20, is not on the same plane as verses 17, 18.<a name=439:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I gather that you are seeking to correct slackness in New Zealand.<a name=439:7></a> It would be distressing to find that any of the gatherings there in dealing with sinful persons fail to get together, and bring the facts to bear on those persons and on the consciences of all, so that the guilt is established before refusal to walk with the guilty is expressed.<a name=439:8></a> As far as I know, this is done generally.<a name=439:9></a>

		My Dear Brother, -- It is only since I came on board this boat that I find your letter of December 26th is still unanswered.<a name=440:46></a> I am very sorry.<a name=440:47></a>

		Shortly after it arrived I took ill and my correspondence became much behind.<a name=441:1></a> In the early part of the year many invitations come from Great Britain and I am compelled to leave replies of most until I am at sea.<a name=441:2></a> Your letter, I regret to say, was placed with these and it was overlooked that it contained a special enquiry.<a name=441:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I hardly know what to say as to the case you mention.<a name=441:4></a> Did I know the man in question and his history I should be the more able to furnish help.<a name=441:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is important to note that Matthew, being the assembly gospel, has "except" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#19:9">Matthew  19:9</a>) -- making a way out for one who may be <i>morally</i> clear in the circumstances of divorce.<a name=441:6></a> But is the person you mention of this class?<a name=441:7></a> Was the cause of his action that mentioned by the Lord?<a name=441:8></a> I do not mean that if the answers are in the negative the man's case is hopeless.<a name=441:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The government of God in the assembly is marked by grace, and hence, if the brethren are satisfied that the man is contrite, having judged as before God and his brethren his sinful conduct, I believe he may be restored to his privileges -- although certain governmental limitations will attach to him.<a name=441:10></a> His present marital relations must be regarded as binding before God, also those of his former wife -- neither can be righteously abrogated.<a name=441:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus the case is now dependent on the man's state, which, of course, must be determined by the brethren in I------.<a name=441:12></a> But in a matter involving such conduct, it is evident that the man's contrition should be without a cloud before he is restored to the fellowship of the saints.<a name=441:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Prophesying -- conveying the mind of God as from God -- although evidently in the province of women in the beginning is scarcely known now, but prayer is, of course, common.<a name=445:17></a> The instruction of the passage is thus very direct at the present time.<a name=445:18></a> A sister therefore should be covered, whether in private, family, or praying amongst the saints.<a name=445:19></a> It is a question of the order of God in creation, and its place in the epistle, as immediately preceding the instruction governing the order of the assembly, is significant.<a name=445:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think "power" in verse 10 refers to covering in verse 6.<a name=445:21></a> The former would refer to the covering as a sign of authority.<a name=445:22></a> On the whole it seems to me that the simple thing for a sister is, to have a covering on her head always -- that is, during the day, etc.<a name=445:23></a> -- she is then ready for prayer as the opportunity offers.<a name=445:24></a>

		My Dear Brother, -- Your letter has just come.<a name=449:4></a> I am thankful you have written.<a name=449:5></a> Not understanding the circumstances and bearing of the 'Reading' you refer to, you are at a certain disadvantage.<a name=449:6></a> It was at Sheringham, which is one of the well-known watering places of England, where there is a meeting and many brethren visit the place to get the benefit of the sea.<a name=449:7></a> A large number of such visitors were present at the reading and what was in mind was to fortify them against the leaven of the place.<a name=449:8></a> We are to admonish one another "in all wisdom" and if I were to tell the brethren present that they should not visit Sheringham, or any sea-side resort, I should defeat my purpose and indeed discredit the truth.<a name=449:9></a> The sea and the beach are God's creatures, and so "good", affording benefit to men and hence to be received with thanksgiving; (that they are abused by ungodly people does not set this fact aside); the intent of the reading was to help saints to do this.<a name=449:10></a> 'Doing things that others do' is simply bathing, sitting or walking by the sea for the sake of health, eating, etc.<a name=449:11></a> -- things right in themselves.<a name=449:12></a> These, as done in a way suitable to christians, as over against and in the presence of, the ways and spirit of the ungodly, are a testimony to God.<a name=449:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		'Sisters and brothers in the meeting disporting together three-quarters naked' is another matter -- it is abominable and should be rebuked.<a name=449:14></a> Apparently you were enabled to rebuke what you saw.<a name=449:15></a> I hope you will maintain that attitude.<a name=449:16></a> The remarks you quote from the magazine rebuke it.<a name=449:17></a> They make allowance for christians making use of beaches, but condemn such conduct as you mention for it is not different from what 'others are doing'.<a name=449:18></a> Brothers and sisters three-quarters naked (even at the beach) is a condition I abhor -- especially in sisters.<a name=449:19></a> If they cover themselves when out of the water, godly seemliness would be preserved, but in this country some do not and hence are deserving of rebuke; and if rebuke is unheeded severer measures should be taken.<a name=449:20></a>

		Beloved Brother, -- I duly received your letter of August 29th, 1934, and was glad to get it.<a name=455:12></a> I was also glad to get all the items of news you kindly sent.<a name=455:13></a> New Zealand is always much on our hearts, and we can pray all the more intelligently as we have knowledge of current happenings.<a name=455:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In regard to remarks in the London notes as to publicity of cases of discipline, I think what is said in the notes is scriptural.<a name=455:15></a> In a small community, of course, where something flagrant occurs and is known to the public, it is wise to make clear that the brethren are with God about it, and have dealt with it in accordance with His mind.<a name=455:16></a> One can understand how this would be applicable in New Zealand.<a name=455:17></a> Sorrowful cases of sin, alas, occur generally in those nominally walking with us, but there seems to have been an epidemic of this in New Zealand.<a name=455:18></a> It is likely that the Lord has allowed certain flagrant cases to bring the general state home to the brethren.<a name=455:19></a> As we "cry out", He pays attention to us and helps us.<a name=455:20></a> Compare <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#6:50">Mark  6:50</a>.<a name=455:21></a>

		As regards Mr.<a name=455:22></a> Joseph Dean, it seems that he is now definitely engaged in the Lord's work and has been moving about in the West somewhat freely during the past winter.<a name=455:23></a> An address of his delivered in Berkeley last spring was typed and circulated, and copies went to Great Britain.<a name=455:24></a> An attack was made upon it by J.<a name=455:25></a> McB------.<a name=455:26></a> The address itself was very defective, and Dean finally agreed to withdraw it, humbling himself because of it.<a name=455:27></a> This has commended him somewhat, but many are still concerned as to his tendency to exaggeration and inaccuracy.<a name=455:28></a> I hope, however, the Lord will help our brother, and that he may be generally acceptable and useful.<a name=455:29></a>

		Beloved Brother, -- I wish to thank you for calling me on the telephone.<a name=457:17></a> I understood you fairly well, especially as to the purpose to suggest a meeting of saints in the other neighbouring gatherings -- perhaps on Saturday of next week.<a name=457:18></a> Our prayers shall go up for this meeting.<a name=457:19></a> The matter is really of universal bearing but wisdom will leave it in nearby hands, trusting they will be governed by right principles and that love that never fails, otherwise brethren further afield will need to act, as also responsible.<a name=457:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In such circumstances we must act with heaven.<a name=457:21></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10">Acts  10</a>shows that it takes the lead in them, and that we must not be out of accord with it.<a name=457:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		General facts (especially those of the 'Report' ) show that those of Wesley Street are clear of the evil that has been shown to exist in Newcastle, that indeed they have stood against it.<a name=457:23></a> This marks them off as on quite a different footing from those from whom they have separated.<a name=457:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Whether our brethren in Wesley Street are in their spirits and general outlook equal to their outward position is what the brethren in the neighbouring meetings have to decide.<a name=457:25></a> In determining this, they will need to humbly consider themselves
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=458>[Page 458]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and not look for more in their brethren than marks them in their respective local settings.<a name=458:1></a> If there be disregard of this and a judgment reached contrary to the Lord's mind He will not fail to resent it.<a name=458:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Some reports are in circulation which indicate that our brethren in Wesley Street are not as to their state fit for fellowship, but they are not supported by accredited facts; having made careful enquiry I can find no foundation for them.<a name=458:3></a> My long interview with them, in company with Mr.<a name=458:4></a> Malpas and you, brought out nothing uncommendable.<a name=458:5></a> Of course, impressions of brethren more or less conversant with Newcastle demand respect and consideration, but they cannot be regarded as conclusive as to any point, except as accompanied by accredited facts.<a name=458:6></a> Then generalities as to the history of Newcastle are but of little importance.<a name=458:7></a> To judge according to God we must have authentic current conditions.<a name=458:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Our brethren who recently withdrew from Wesley Street must have a great place in our minds.<a name=458:9></a> All godly effort should be made to recover them, but in these efforts we must not make our brethren at Wesley Street suffer.<a name=458:10></a> We cannot ignore their rights as shown above.<a name=458:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Our brethren who have separated have had the opportunity to walk with their brethren and have failed to do so.<a name=458:12></a> I have examined nearly all their letters giving reasons for their withdrawal and I believe it will be owned by all who soberly weigh them that their writers do not furnish valid ground for withdrawing from their brethren.<a name=458:13></a> If this be so their course is (in principle at least) schismatic.<a name=458:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then it is admitted by those who know the facts attaching to them that even if all the brethren now separated wish to return to Wesley Street certain of them would not be regarded as clear of the evil that was the cause of the present sorrow.<a name=458:15></a> In considering the conditions at Wesley Street this fact will be in view, and the Lord may make it clear that in recognising our brethren there as morally clear and hence possessing the same rights as ourselves, the position may be more favourable for the recovery of those now separated, that is, they can be served respectively according to the holiness and discipline of God's house.<a name=458:16></a>
