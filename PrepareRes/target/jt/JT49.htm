		J.T.<a name=1:1></a> It is in mind to consider what is characteristically <i>within</i>, that is, in a spiritual sense.<a name=1:2></a> Genesis 7, the first scripture read, conveys this idea, and indicates that what is within in our dispensation involves limitations by God.<a name=1:3></a> It is said that Jehovah shut Noah in.<a name=1:4></a> Noah himself only being mentioned as shut in would suggest that he is viewed as operating, and that the sphere of his operations is determined by God.<a name=1:5></a> The Lord, in answering the enquiries of His disciples, after He rose and before going to heaven, as to whether it was at this time that He would restore the kingdom to Israel, said, "It is not yours to know times or seasons, which the Father has placed in his own authority" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:7">Acts  1:7</a>).<a name=1:6></a> He had been speaking about the Spirit as the promise of the Father, which they were to await; so that the Lord in Acts is evidently taking up the position of operating in an area allotted to Him by the Father.<a name=1:7></a> The Father had reserved in His own power the times and seasons, and Acts shows that the Lord was accepting that, and that His present operations are according to the divine determination.<a name=1:8></a> Hence in the type it would seem as if this is in mind in Jehovah shutting Noah in the ark until the cover was lifted off.<a name=1:9></a> Its having rested on the mountains of Ararat refers also in the type to the faith period dependent on the Spirit.<a name=1:10></a> The dove is sent out from Noah and returns to him.<a name=1:11></a> Later he sends her out and he now has the evidence from her in the olive leaf brought in at evening that the waters are low on the earth.<a name=1:12></a> Finally he sends her out and she returns no more.<a name=1:13></a> Then he takes off the

		<a href="../bible/John.htm#20:29">John  20:29</a> contemplates that we are in the period of faith, "blessed they who have not seen and have believed".<a name=2:2></a> In Acts 1, the cloud received the Lord out of the sight of the disciples.<a name=2:3></a> The faith period began.<a name=2:4></a> In this connection the ark represents life, having all the varieties of life, but they are inside.<a name=2:5></a> Noah is shut in, but with all the varieties of life, so it would seem as if we should consider first this thought of the gradations of life.<a name=2:6></a> The capacity of the ark is specified in chapter 6, as if it were large enough to include all the varieties of life.<a name=2:7></a> The suggestion is, therefore, that the Lord for the moment is occupied on those lines.<a name=2:8></a> When we come to John 20, we have the highest grade of life; it is by the breath of Christ.<a name=2:9></a> The status is seen in the disciples being regarded as His brethren: "Go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God" (verse 17).<a name=2:10></a> Breathing into them would be in keeping with these great relationships, and would imply the highest order of life.<a name=2:11></a> In Genesis 1 and in the gospels and epistles, we have life in a graded way, all seen, of course, in christians.<a name=2:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is the time of life, in that sense, through faith, as John says, "believing ye might have life in his name" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#20:31">John  20:31</a>).<a name=2:13></a> It would seem as if we are to be conversant with the various features of life.<a name=2:14></a> Noah shut in is typical of Christ engaged in this way; presently He will take on other things.<a name=2:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		N.L.<a name=2:16></a> In suggesting that they all went to Noah, does that imply that every phase or grade of life responds to Christ?<a name=2:17></a>

		J.T.<a name=2:18></a> That is what comes out.<a name=2:19></a> The references are striking, "every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them

		C.H.<a name=3:8></a>H.<a name=3:9></a> Is the thought that in the faith period divine operations take place in this living way?<a name=3:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:11></a> That is what I was thinking -- all in relation to life, animal life particularly, for vegetable life is not mentioned; it would be a millennial thought.<a name=3:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.W.<a name=3:13></a> Is the suggestion that all spiritual life is held in relation to Christ?<a name=3:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:15></a> Yes; all would die otherwise.<a name=3:16></a> John's gospel has in mind to stress that it is on the principle of faith -- life is on the principle of faith, and the Lord says, "Blessed they who have not seen and have believed".<a name=3:17></a> So John says that he wrote of the signs that Jesus did, "that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life in his name" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#20:31">John  20:31</a>).<a name=3:18></a> All outside of faith is in death.<a name=3:19></a> Paul says, "Having

	<div class="paragraph">
		F.W.<a name=4:4></a> Would the limited circumstances in which they were in the ark suggest typically that these conditions would promote faith and so help them?<a name=4:5></a> I am thinking now of those who would be intelligent -- Noah, his wife, his sons, and his sons' wives.<a name=4:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:7></a> They are represented in that way.<a name=4:8></a> "On the same day went Noah, and Shem and Ham and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark" (verse 3), as if the family of Noah, the persons specified, go in intelligently.<a name=4:9></a> The others are said to go <i>to</i> Noah, as if there is a lower grade of life contemplated, and it is important that it should have an object, that it should be governed by an object.<a name=4:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I.L.<a name=4:11></a> What is the force of verse 19 of the previous chapter, where Noah is instructed to <i>bring</i> them in?<a name=4:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:13></a> I just read that to show the different phases presented.<a name=4:14></a> Bringing in would be Noah's part, but finally <i>he is attractive</i> as in the family position inside; he is there in relation to his family.<a name=4:15></a> <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:7">Hebrews  11:7</a> says he "prepared an ark for the saving of his house", which is not as large a thought as the beasts and cattle and fowls.<a name=4:16></a> I suppose the idea of the house is abstract, referring to the saints viewed as of him, but the others need an object, to be put under control, that is, the lower forms of life; young

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:5></a> Yes.<a name=5:6></a> The more we look into it, the more striking are the variations.<a name=5:7></a> They appear to be repetitions, but they are variations to bring out every phase of the position, and one great phase is that Noah is an attractive object to life, to those who live, because they came to him into the ark.<a name=5:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.H.<a name=5:9></a>W.<a name=5:10></a> Is this seen in John's gospel where the disciples say, "Where abidest thou" and the Lord says, "Come and see"?<a name=5:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:12></a> That is the principle of John's gospel, "Come and see".<a name=5:13></a> It is a characteristic word in his gospel; and applied now, the question is, what is there to see?<a name=5:14></a> Luke does not stress that side, there it is more the approach of God to men in grace, whereas John contemplates the work of God in the saints, and implies what is attractive.<a name=5:15></a> Life is always attractive, even in physical things, so that "Come and see" is a characteristic word.<a name=5:16></a> Nathanael represents one who is moved by it.<a name=5:17></a> As he came, the Lord saw him.<a name=5:18></a> As one invited to come, he may have thought it optional whether he does or not, but it is not optional.<a name=5:19></a> If he remains unmoved he is spiritually dead.<a name=5:20></a> A subject of the work of God will come, and in coming he is under the surveillance of the Lord.<a name=5:21></a> Nathanael came, and as he moved towards Christ, as He saw him coming to Him, the Lord <i>names</i> him.<a name=5:22></a> Life is marked by movement; and it is named as it is in movement.<a name=5:23></a>

		are distinguished.<a name=6:1></a> Applying the thought generally to christians, it would allude to lower forms of life, what appeared in the early stages of the work of God, and then development.<a name=6:2></a> We have in the New Testament vegetable life introduced: "the fruit of the Spirit" is such an allusion.<a name=6:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		L.I.<a name=6:4></a> Would you say a little as to the varieties mentioned here, such as creeping things, fowl, beasts?<a name=6:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:6></a> Creeping things, I suppose, represent a phase in us, not to be despised, though certainly not so attractive as the highest orders of life; not of the same interest as a fowl that can fly in the heavens, nor beasts as seen in <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#30:30">Proverbs  30:30</a>.<a name=6:7></a> We read in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#40:31">Isaiah  40:31</a> of how they who wait on the Lord "shall mount up with wings as eagles".<a name=6:8></a> The creeping things cannot mount up, but still there is evidence of life there, there is in the designation the idea of number and getting together.<a name=6:9></a> It is just the great general thought of graduations of life, all of which are of God.<a name=6:10></a> The repetition here shows what interest God has in these forms of life.<a name=6:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.W.<a name=6:12></a>W.<a name=6:13></a> Do we get these various features put together by heaven in Peter's sheet?<a name=6:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:15></a> It is the counterpart of this, bringing out the idea of a <i>vessel</i> as we have had it, bringing the thought down to ourselves.<a name=6:16></a> Peter likened the vessel to a great sheet descending from heaven to earth, and drawn up again.<a name=6:17></a> So we have to consider that these creatures represent ideas, forms of life to be carried through in us.<a name=6:18></a> They take concrete form in christians.<a name=6:19></a> Vegetable life is not mentioned in the ark, because it is not the time for it, but still in the New Testament we have reference to Genesis 1 in that sense, because we have the different gradations of life in that chapter.<a name=6:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:4></a> That is the point to come to, and not to despise any evidence of God's work.<a name=7:5></a> Take Nicodemus -- he could not even understand new birth.<a name=7:6></a> His is certainly a low form, but the principle of life was there; he remains in the council, but as in it, he says a word for Christ.<a name=7:7></a> He neglects association with Christ while Christ is alive here on earth, he missed that great privilege, but identifies himself with Christ in death and brings a large quantity of myrrh and aloes for His burial.<a name=7:8></a> You can see he is not a person of Mary Magdalene's type.<a name=7:9></a> Mary Magdalene comes in immediately after him in John's gospel, and although she is not much ahead in regard to Christ's resurrection, she is far ahead of him as to affection, and comes into the full thought of the highest grade of life, whereas there is no evidence that Nicodemus did.<a name=7:10></a>

		A.M.<a name=7:11></a>H.<a name=7:12></a> Do these lower grades of life suggest persons in whom the mixed condition is particularly prominent, whereas the highest grades would indicate the work of God being more in evidence; but we have to take account of every grade?<a name=7:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:14></a> That is the way we may see the truth worked out in John, and in the ark here you will observe the small measure of the window on the top which would afford a view heavenward.<a name=7:15></a> There are storeys in the ark; I suppose the upper would refer to the highest grade of life, finished a cubit above.<a name=7:16></a>

		My thought is to speak on <i>youthfulness</i> in the saints.<a name=55:1></a> Any feature of humanity that is worth calling attention to is found in the saints; in the Lord Jesus, of course, all was in infinite perfection, but I do not bring Him in here.<a name=55:2></a> I refer to humanity in creatures.<a name=55:3></a> Jesus Himself looked upon a young man, and loved him, calling attention, I suppose, to what there was before the introduction dispensationally of the new generation; it was in the probationary period.<a name=55:4></a> If He looks upon a young man now to love him, he is one of the saints.<a name=55:5></a> How often the Lord must have looked on the apostle John in a personal way!<a name=55:6></a> John must have been conscious of the Lord's admiring look.<a name=55:7></a> The Spirit through him tells us that he was the disciple whom Jesus loved.<a name=55:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I venture to bring forward this subject, basing my thoughts and remarks on these passages in the Pentateuch -- Genesis, Exodus and Numbers.<a name=55:9></a> Many corroborating scriptures could be produced, but for convenience I thought it well to restrict myself to these passages from Moses about youth.<a name=55:10></a> The book of Genesis may indeed be regarded as an old man's book.<a name=55:11></a> With the exception of Joseph, little is made in the way of special reference to youth, but special reference is made to Joseph, such references as light up the whole book, directing the attention of faith to one young man.<a name=55:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first mention of him is at his birth, and the suggestion is that he was spiritual -- if not in any concrete way, certainly potentially -- for Jacob, we are told, as Joseph was born, would leave Padan-Aram,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=56>[Page 56]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		to which land he did not belong, and in which he had spent too much of his time.<a name=56:1></a> It was not the land of promise, and any other land must be foreign to faith, whatever its glory according to man.<a name=56:2></a> It was not the realm of faith, so Jacob significantly spoke of moving away as Rachel bore Joseph.<a name=56:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I refer to this as important, for youth, which is to develop to maturity and experience so as to be eligible for a crown, generally begins early to manifest the evidence of the divine work.<a name=56:4></a> In some sense God begins at the very earliest possible date in view of building up vessels such as I have mentioned.<a name=56:5></a> Even a Paul, although living a good period of his life in lawlessness, yet spoke about being separated from his infancy.<a name=56:6></a> God had done it.<a name=56:7></a> In Joseph the Spirit of God would direct our view to the spiritual side in him appearing in a dark scene; the darker the surroundings the more brilliant is the shining out of the work of God.<a name=56:8></a> Perhaps nobody but Jacob could discern what was there.<a name=56:9></a> Jacob certainly discerned something, and that something is enlarged upon as he proceeds with Joseph, for, as many of us know, Joseph is put before his mother in the display of Jacob's family before Esau.<a name=56:10></a> Esau is the brother who proved false, but had every opportunity of recovering himself by the spiritual element in his brother's family.<a name=56:11></a> If we have to do with Esau's counterpart now, we shall not testify much to them by mere doctrine, or learning, but by spiritual power.<a name=56:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the spiritual discerns all things, and he is discerned of no one.<a name=56:13></a> Did Esau take notice of Joseph's appearing before his mother?<a name=56:14></a> It is doubtful, but the testimony was there, and that is the irrefutable testimony, spirituality, which the natural man cannot compass.<a name=56:15></a> The history of Joseph is built up on

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then we have the record that his father loved Him above all his sons, Joseph being the son of his old age.<a name=57:14></a> He was loveable, and the sequel shows that he retained this affection throughout, it was not lost on him.<a name=57:15></a> Jacob made him a coat of many colours.<a name=57:16></a> All this distinction brought upon him persecution; his brethren hated him more and more.<a name=57:17></a> Such is the natural attitude as the spiritual shines.<a name=57:18></a> It is a very good test, for if we are free of persecution, we may well question our spirituality as to how much of it there is.<a name=57:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We are told in chapter 39 that Jehovah was with him; and I may say here, there is nothing more important to say to young men and women than what I am calling attention to now.<a name=58:8></a> We see beautiful progress here; Jehovah was with him, and not just occasionally.<a name=58:9></a> This always marks those whom God approves.<a name=58:10></a> The time comes in the history of a person when God is with him.<a name=58:11></a> Jehovah was with Joseph.<a name=58:12></a> He was now a slave, but Jehovah was with him, and that fact appears in whatever he is doing, even the most menial thing would bring it out.<a name=58:13></a> If he were to clean his master's boots, he would do it well, God was with him.<a name=58:14></a> Then, we are told, he was a prosperous man; that is increase.<a name=58:15></a> That is the divine way, for spirituality means increase more and more.<a name=58:16></a> Chapter 37 does not say

		I now come to Exodus to bring out another thing in regard to youth, in chapter 24, but shall comment very briefly on this passage.<a name=59:9></a> Having built up the foundation in Genesis for ministry in young men, we have youths here sent by Moses to do <i>priestly</i> work.<a name=59:10></a> I want to call attention to the fact that God, before naming a thing, would bring out that it exists, that it is functioning.<a name=59:11></a> That is one point I seek to make clear from this passage.<a name=59:12></a> Many of us in our youth have desired to be known as teachers or evangelists before the needed ability marked us, whereas, God's thought is, let the thing shine before naming it, let it be there unquestionably.<a name=59:13></a> Even Paul was not sent out formally for a considerable time; yet he was able to preach and to pray, he was a priest, for the Lord said to Ananias, "Behold, he is praying".<a name=59:14></a> A great feature in a young man is that he is marked by prayer; indeed it is the public testimony to priesthood.<a name=59:15></a> We are told to pray always.<a name=59:16></a> The Lord in Luke is seen about ten times

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I now go on to Joshua.<a name=60:7></a> He is not called a young man when first introduced to us in Exodus 17, but he is in the passage I read in Exodus 33.<a name=60:8></a> He is a military man as introduced to us, a trustworthy man too, who did well in breaking the power of Amalek by the edge of the sword, but now he is said to be a young man and not departing from the tabernacle; not simply that he is there, but he is not leaving the position -- that is the idea.<a name=60:9></a> You might be there and your mind elsewhere, but his mind is there.<a name=60:10></a> That is his determination, which is a very good thing in young people, that is determination in the things that are right, but not determination to carry out one's own will, which is often seen in young people to their ruin, but Joshua is in a position in connection with God's will, and he is not departing from it -- "from within the tent".<a name=60:11></a> Moses went into the camp, but this young man did not depart from within the tabernacle.<a name=60:12></a> It is a fine trait in a young person when you know that a certain attitude or position is right, that it is of God, to resolve to continue in it.<a name=60:13></a> We are told in Romans 7 of an almost unspeakable experience or analysis, but the Holy Spirit enabled the servant who went through it to write it down for us, so that <i>we</i> may understand how he comes out triumphantly with the power of

		In moving on to Numbers 11, we come to Joshua again, but now, alas, in a very different role.<a name=61:4></a> He is still a youth -- one of Moses' young men.<a name=61:5></a> In this connection there is one thing I cannot omit saying, that this young man, who became a great servant of God, at one time had bad hearing, not physical hearing, but spiritual hearing, which is a very dangerous thing in the house of God.<a name=61:6></a> It is a great disadvantage to people who are seeking to listen to what the Spirit of God is saying if they cannot hear physically, but it has to be accepted, or overcome as far as may be, but when there is poor hearing in a spiritual sense, that person is dangerous.<a name=61:7></a> He will misconstrue things that are said, he will report them wrongly, he will give out what he thinks is the sense instead of giving the words used.<a name=61:8></a> I am referring to Exodus 32.<a name=61:9></a> Moses and Joshua were coming down from the mountain, an old and a young brother together, and the young one says, "There is a shout of war in the camp".<a name=61:10></a> Moses says, "It is the noise of alternate singing I hear".<a name=61:11></a> Suppose Moses and Joshua have to give evidence as to what they heard, what would be the result?<a name=61:12></a> The young man says, 'The voice of war', which would be favourable to the idolaters and would seem to vindicate them.<a name=61:13></a> Moses says, 'The voice of mirth', which would not vindicate them, but indicate idolatry; you will thus see the position.<a name=61:14></a> Suppose one says, 'To whom are we to listen?<a name=61:15></a>' I should say the old man, the brother of <i>experience</i>.<a name=61:16></a> Joshua would bring in a false report that time if called upon, had he not been corrected by Moses.<a name=61:17></a> When spying out the land, he brought

		I wish to speak this evening about angelic ministry, although in Scripture much evidently is held back as to angels, and we are warned against the worship of angels, or as to them, enquiring into what we have not seen, angels themselves refusing expressly to be worshipped.<a name=65:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Still, Scripture has much to say about them.<a name=65:2></a> They existed before man, and evidently before the earth, for Jehovah tells Job that the sons of God -- obviously referring to angels -- shouted for joy as the foundation of the earth was laid.<a name=65:3></a> They are not to be regarded as being at a great distance from us and unknowable by us, for in the epistle to the Hebrews we are enjoined to use hospitality, and some, it is said, entertained angels unawares, implying that it was a great honour.<a name=65:4></a> We know that saints of old entertained them, Abraham, for instance, and Lot; Manoah and his wife, too, and others; so that they are capable of communicating with the saints, or christians, being sons of God themselves, they have some affinity with us as sons of God.<a name=65:5></a> Then we know that, as to the assemblies, Christ sent His angel to testify the book of Revelation to His bondman John.<a name=65:6></a> And later He says He sent His angel, without mentioning John: "I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify .<a name=65:7></a>.<a name=65:8></a>.<a name=65:9></a> these things", so we should understand something of angelic communication.<a name=65:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Moreover, they are said to be in the heavenly city in which we have part.<a name=65:11></a> The names of the twelve tribes of Israel are inscribed there, and twelve angels are at the gates.<a name=65:12></a> If we make a present application, they are not far away from us in an administrative

		sense, and then we are told in a very comprehensive manner that God has made His angels spirits and that they are sent out for ministry, sent out to minister to those who are heirs of salvation; so that we are attended by them.<a name=66:1></a> If we do not understand them, then we have scarcely appropriated much that God has provided for us.<a name=66:2></a> You will understand that I am not speaking of them abstractly, or as by themselves, but in the sense in which they are introduced in Scripture as having part in the service of God and in the testimony of God, and as I said, attending every day upon those who are heirs of salvation.<a name=66:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We see them first formally attending a rebellious person, Hagar, but she was of the household of faith, employed in it, and therefore came under the notice and service of angels.<a name=66:4></a> Any such as she, who may be rebellious, for she fled from her mistress, would do well to take note that angels may be attending them, for although we turn aside as chafed, or fretted, or in self-will, the ministrations of God follow us, specially by the hands of angels.<a name=66:5></a> They had a great deal to do in the Old Testament, even the law being given through the service of angels, and in that connection we are taught that they represent what is mysterious.<a name=66:6></a> Christians ought to be initiated in all mysteries, and we should learn that mysteries belong to us.<a name=66:7></a> We read of the mystery of the seven stars which the Lord revealed to John, the seven stars which He held in His right hand being the seven angels of the assemblies, but it was mysterious.<a name=66:8></a> If the truth be known, every christian had part in that mystery as representative of the whole, for these angels are in the Lord's hands, He holds them.<a name=66:9></a> First it says He holds them, and then that He <i>has</i> them.<a name=66:10></a> They are mysterious, inclusive of all that forms the assembly, for it is a question of

		responsibility, representation in responsibility, and anyone who elects himself out of that brings his christianity into discredit and doubt.<a name=67:1></a> I mention that, so that we may see how this thought of angelic ministry is interwoven with christianity as well as with the dispensation of law.<a name=67:2></a> And in that connection the thought is peculiarly mysterious; we have records of repeated angelic services, the persons serving speaking as God Himself in several instances, so that in various ways they represent divine attributes, and even the divine presence in a very concrete way.<a name=67:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Three men came to Abraham, two were angels; they visited Lot later, but as coming to Abraham they are mentioned as men.<a name=67:4></a> Indeed, it is doubtful whether men could be in communication with these beings intelligently, save as they appear in that way, that is, in some form intelligible and knowable by us, for we are limited.<a name=67:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This brings me to Gabriel who is called a man, "The man Gabriel".<a name=67:6></a> He represents what I have been saying in a very remarkable way.<a name=67:7></a> Again I would say, I am not seeking to bring the matter before you in any academic way, or treating it by itself, but it is a question of what the angels bring to us of God, the various attributes and features of the blessed God that are represented in them.<a name=67:8></a> As I said before, they are not far away, because they are attending us, and particularly in Gabriel's service.<a name=67:9></a> He and Michael are the only ones called by name.<a name=67:10></a> No doubt each angel is named, as each star is named, but we have these two, one of them is called an archangel, and Gabriel is mentioned by name, and he is evidently a being of rank, for he said to Zacharias, "<i>I</i> am Gabriel, who stand before God" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:19">Luke  1:19</a>).<a name=67:11></a>

		Now I want to dwell on Gabriel, and that is what I have in mind in making all these remarks.<a name=68:1></a> He it is that is spoken of in all the passages read, and he evidently represents the priestly side of angelic ministry.<a name=68:2></a> Their services most generally correspond with our own, all divine service being expressed in some way or other in the Lord Jesus.<a name=68:3></a> Of these two angels specified by name, the one represents military service, that is Michael, and the other priestly service, both seen perfectly in Christ, who is "head of all principality and authority", including angels.<a name=68:4></a> Every function and service from God is expressed in Christ, and we love to see it, whether it is expressed directly in Him personally, or in the saints here, or in the angels, it is the same thing.<a name=68:5></a> There is instruction in the variety of persons through whom the services come.<a name=68:6></a> God has pleasure in the services in whomsoever they may be.<a name=68:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In coming to Gabriel we see him here in the holy place, showing what latitude these beings have, and yet they are subordinated to man.<a name=68:8></a> We christians, it is said, shall judge angels.<a name=68:9></a> A wonderful thought.<a name=68:10></a> We are to judge the world, too.<a name=68:11></a> But it is very remarkable that we are to judge angels.<a name=68:12></a> We shall have to say to them, and that is another reason why we should be conversant with what Scripture teaches as to them.<a name=68:13></a> Angels as a whole, even those fallen, are subordinate to man, Christ being Head of all principality and power as Man.<a name=68:14></a> He was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, but He is crowned with glory and honour -- far beyond angels, indeed, He has gone far beyond all the heavens, showing His deity.<a name=68:15></a> He is above the angels, in fact He speaks of them as His own, which is another indication, by the way, of His deity.<a name=68:16></a> We could not think of Paul saying, "<i>I</i> .<a name=68:17></a>.<a name=68:18></a>.<a name=68:19></a> have sent mine angel", although he did send a representative in Timothy, in some sense like an angel, but Jesus

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I hope no one will think I am enlarging unduly on this point, because of what I have said, but they are not far from us, and they have to do with all that is current at the present time in a wonderful way.<a name=69:6></a> Everything is being regulated under God on account of the saints, "those who shall inherit salvation".<a name=69:7></a> Here we have a priestly angel, one who has liberty to appear at the right of the altar of incense, which is in the priestly sanctuary of the temple.<a name=69:8></a> I present him thus so that we may see how, in the most spiritual things, we need this angelic service, for our bodies may limit us in the most sacred relations with God.<a name=69:9></a> The Lord Jesus Himself had the ministration of angels at the most critical time, an angel ministering to Him in Gethsemane.<a name=69:10></a> They minister to us, too, and we constantly need them, for our very bodily limitations interfere with us in the most sacred and spiritual features of the service of God.<a name=69:11></a> Here we are on high ground, for the angel has in mind one who is to make way for Christ; he is concerned about him who is to thus serve the Lord Jesus, to make His paths straight.<a name=69:12></a> So Gabriel is here at the right hand of the altar of incense as if he were ready to make effective the whole position.<a name=69:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The position was that Zacharias was offering incense, doing it well, as far as the natural eye could see.<a name=69:14></a> The people outside were praying; things appeared to be in order, yet there is unbelief in the whole position, and Gabriel is going to bring it out, under God.<a name=69:15></a> How we may be engaged in the most orderly way in the service of God, both within and without, and yet unbelief mark the whole position!<a name=69:16></a> Gabriel's service here is to bring

	<div class="paragraph">
		that out, not that it is the stated service, but it brings it out in result; the true state of things is brought to light.<a name=70:1></a> That is to say, Zacharias, although serving as priest and offering incense, doing it in order externally, is not in the exercise of faith, -- for without faith it is impossible to please God, but the angel is here to help what is going on, not to set it aside.<a name=70:2></a> He stood at the right of the altar of incense.<a name=70:3></a> You can see therefore how these great beings excel in strength, and how they are entirely amenable to the will of God, and ready to do what is needed.<a name=70:4></a> Here he is at the right of the altar of incense ready to make effective what was apparent.<a name=70:5></a> The unbelief is brought out, Zacharias is exposed, and is caused to be dumb for a season; but his mouth is opened later, and he praises God, thus the angel's ministry is a perfect success.<a name=70:6></a> Zacharias is humbled, Elizabeth is humbled too, but at the end they are seen as two priests.<a name=70:7></a> Zacharias and Elizabeth at the end of the chapter are praising God in a truly spiritual way.<a name=70:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So Gabriel says, "<i>I</i> am Gabriel".<a name=70:9></a> Why did he say that?<a name=70:10></a> To bring out the service entrusted to him and the great place he had in the service of God, as if Zacharias were to understand that an immediate representative of God was there.<a name=70:11></a> He stood before God, as an active servant ready to do His behests.<a name=70:12></a> We have to attend to the success of everything -- it is the success of things that stimulates and encourages, and the success in the incoming of Gabriel is that Zacharias and Elizabeth become worshippers in the true sense, as they never had been before, as seen at the end of Luke 1.<a name=70:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		You will understand that we should make room for angelic service in whatever form it may appear.<a name=70:14></a> Some one may say he does not understand.<a name=70:15></a> Well, as we consider what Scripture says, the Lord gives us understanding.<a name=70:16></a> Every reference to angels in the

		In the next paragraph in this chapter, we have Gabriel formally called by his name, and going to Nazareth to visit Mary, and understanding the position.<a name=71:5></a> The greatest thing is in mind.<a name=71:6></a> It has often been remarked that if an angel were told to sweep a crossing, he would do it.<a name=71:7></a> Whatever is needed in the will of God, the angels will do as directed, and this is characteristic of them.<a name=71:8></a> Now Gabriel is entrusted with the greatest message -- informing Mary of the incarnation, that a divine Person is about to become a Man.<a name=71:9></a> We are to understand that all these mighty beings are available for us in the greatest of our transactions, and in drawing near, this priestly angel -- in fact he is called a man -- sympathetically explains.<a name=71:10></a> How sympathetic he is with Mary!<a name=71:11></a> "Hail, thou favoured one!<a name=71:12></a> the Lord is with thee".<a name=71:13></a> What a word that is!<a name=71:14></a> how assuring!<a name=71:15></a> The greatest transaction is in mind, a divine transaction, but still she has to do with it, for Isaiah says, "Behold, the virgin shall conceive and shall bring forth a son, and call his name Immanuel" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#7:14">Isaiah  7:14</a>).<a name=71:16></a> How accredited she is in that remarkable scripture!<a name=71:17></a> And now Gabriel is before her, he has come to her; he goes in and says, "Hail, thou favoured one!<a name=71:18></a> the Lord is with thee".<a name=71:19></a> We need such stimulating words from priestly lips, sympathetic lips, as great matters are before us.<a name=71:20></a> It is a poor thing for any of us if he has not had a great matter to attend to.<a name=71:21></a> Christians are called into the greatest matters, and God would have us to understand their greatness, and He would have us to understand how to deal with them, and serve in them.<a name=71:22></a>

		I am not going to occupy you with Michael by himself, but the facts recorded as to him bear on us, as to whether we understand that the great matters we are called into require angelic services.<a name=72:5></a> Of course, all services are under Christ: Michael's, and Gabriel's, and the services of every angel are under Christ.<a name=72:6></a> It is a question of what He is doing.<a name=72:7></a> The Spirit of God brings it home to us.<a name=72:8></a> I am not seeking to make ourselves great in our own minds in the flesh, we are unfit for any place at all before God as in the flesh, but think of what we are by the Spirit.<a name=72:9></a> In the chapter I have been calling attention to, Luke 1, it is said of the Lord: "He shall be great".<a name=72:10></a> It is not the greatness of a Simon, who gave out that he was great, but what enters into the incarnation is the greatness of Christ, the greatness of man in Christ.<a name=72:11></a> The greatness of man is involved, and as we understand that we have to do with great things, we become great persons in that sense.<a name=72:12></a> We are stimulated and encouraged by priestly service, as we see in Gabriel's communication to Mary.<a name=72:13></a> Mary would understand her great blessedness later when she was with the Lord.<a name=72:14></a> A certain woman said to the Lord, "Blessed is the womb that has borne thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked", but He said, "Yea rather, blessed are they who hear the word of God and keep it".<a name=72:15></a> That is what christians are characteristically, and the blessing lies in that, so that the Lord through Gabriel, through a priestly

		Now I come to Daniel to show how angelic service gives us understanding.<a name=73:7></a> It is not that angels are the teachers, but we see here how the principle of giving understanding is set out in Gabriel, who is called a man.<a name=73:8></a> It is said "the Lord will give thee understanding in all things" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:7">2 Timothy  2:7</a>).<a name=73:9></a> That is the point.<a name=73:10></a> Daniel is greatly concerned about the vision of the great empire before him.<a name=73:11></a> These matters are of great importance just now, and brethren should understand them as seen in the book of Daniel.<a name=73:12></a> He is particularly concerned about the little horn, which became so great, antichrist in character.<a name=73:13></a> And someone with a man's voice speaks and says, "Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision".<a name=73:14></a> You see how in answer to an inquiry of a soul as to these matters, understanding is given (<a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#8:15">Daniel  8:15</a> - 17).<a name=73:15></a> Gabriel is a great personage, but subservient to a human voice, which says, "Make this man to understand".<a name=73:16></a> In the verse read it says, "I Daniel had seen the vision".<a name=73:17></a> Let us take that in; we are prone to overlook important truths brought before us, and God is bringing things before us at the present time in view of the end.<a name=73:18></a> We have a word in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#13:18">Revelation  13:18</a>, "He that has understanding

		It is in mind to speak of guidance; such guidance as comes through righteous spiritual calculation.<a name=78:1></a> There is, of course, direct guidance for christians.<a name=78:2></a> The books of Exodus and Numbers teach us as to direct guidance from God through this dark world.<a name=78:3></a> It was never His thought to leave His people to find their own way through the world; so He came in for Israel, even in Egypt, and went before them in the cloud.<a name=78:4></a> Then, as the tabernacle was reared up, the cloud came down upon it, and the glory of Jehovah filled it.<a name=78:5></a> The people were to move.<a name=78:6></a> They had come out of Egypt by divine direction in the pillar, now they are to go through to Canaan, through the wilderness, in which there were no roads.<a name=78:7></a> And so they were to observe the pillar of cloud by day and the fire by night on the tabernacle.<a name=78:8></a> The tabernacle represented the testimony that God would render.<a name=78:9></a> It is indeed called the tabernacle of testimony, so that, whilst the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night were to guide, they were to guide in relation to the tent of testimony, which means for us that as we, believers in Christ, are concerned about God's testimony.<a name=78:10></a> As we recognise the assembly, disallowing all that is contrary to it, we shall find direct guidance from God.<a name=78:11></a>

		That is the general position.<a name=78:12></a> Any Israelite taking it into his mind to separate himself from the system of things set up by Moses under God, and seeking to find his own way, would fall in that wilderness.<a name=78:13></a> His guidance depended on maintaining his position, the position divinely assigned to him, in relation to the tabernacle.<a name=78:14></a> Israel was divided into four camps of three tribes each, and they were to encamp around the tabernacle; one on the east, one on the south,

		As I said, this is the great general position, for what I am speaking of from Exodus and Numbers is just a type of our own times.<a name=79:12></a> Some have chosen individual paths, many have grouped together and set up systems of religion of their own, but the only means of guidance is in relation to the assembly, for it is in relation to it that the cloud stands.<a name=79:13></a> If anyone thinks that I am referring to those who are designated 'brethren' as over against the others with a religious designation, it is an entire mistake.<a name=79:14></a> When I speak about the assembly, I speak about all christians.<a name=79:15></a> But when one speaks about the assembly in a concrete way, one is forced to think of those who recognise it, who move as of it, and who disallow all else in thought and practice.<a name=79:16></a> Such are certain to have divine guidance through this dark world.<a name=79:17></a> Darkness which may be felt is settling

		I have selected first of all these four leprous men at the gate of Samaria, often used in gospel testimony and rightly so; but that is not what is in mind now.<a name=80:4></a> They represent persons who calculate righteously and, I may say, spiritually.<a name=80:5></a> They weigh thoughtfully the circumstances in which they are.<a name=80:6></a> They are able to say that if they do not do anything, they will die.<a name=80:7></a> Something, therefore, has to be done.<a name=80:8></a> Many come to that, not knowing what to do, but that something has to be done.<a name=80:9></a> It is a point of importance to determine that something has to be done.<a name=80:10></a> The next thing is, What is to be done?<a name=80:11></a> I must tax my intelligence, my discernment, my spirituality.<a name=80:12></a> I must tax my love too.<a name=80:13></a> I must calculate as to whether I am governed by love in facing my circumstances, whether I am thinking selfishly or in love.<a name=80:14></a>

		Well now, I want to show from Acts 16 how the apostle Paul and those who laboured with him moved.<a name=85:4></a> As I have been saying, the Lord could easily have told Paul that the preaching was to be in Europe; but He did not do so.<a name=85:5></a> The Spirit, we are told, would not allow him to preach the word in Asia, verse 6, and verse 7 says, "having come down to Mysia, they attempted to go to Bithynia, and the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them".<a name=85:6></a> All that is searching.<a name=85:7></a> Is there something wrong with Paul?<a name=85:8></a> Could another serve better than he in those fields?<a name=85:9></a> That would be the way it would come to him.<a name=85:10></a> Twice over he is hindered.<a name=85:11></a> Do not go there, the Spirit says, and yet He does not tell Paul where to go.<a name=85:12></a> These are remarkable things.<a name=85:13></a> The point is, Can I transfer this to myself?<a name=85:14></a> Can each of us enquire as to himself, why these happenings, why these circumstances?<a name=85:15></a> Well, the apostle Paul does not seem to be overwhelmed by uncertainty.<a name=85:16></a> A vision appears in the night to him (verse 9).<a name=85:17></a> The night suggests that there was some darkness, but there was a vision, and it appeared to him.<a name=85:18></a> Let us be looking out for this.<a name=85:19></a> If the circumstances are extraordinary, there may be other such circumstances which will be light to me.<a name=85:20></a> Let me wait for these, for if God brings in one extraordinary circumstance, He can bring in another, and this other may be what I need.<a name=85:21></a> So then let me tax my mind; my resolve being to do the will of God.<a name=85:22></a> I have begun with that in mind.<a name=85:23></a> I have resolved to do nothing else but the will of God.<a name=85:24></a> Let me begin with that.<a name=85:25></a> Next, Am I selfish in my service?<a name=85:26></a> Do I seek a name in it?<a name=85:27></a> Do I seek any material gain in it?<a name=85:28></a> Let me challenge

		In what I have to say at this time, David will be prominent.<a name=107:1></a> He is mentioned in the verse read in Psalm 72: "The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended".<a name=107:2></a> Were they all written down we would have had a large book of prayer.<a name=107:3></a> No doubt allusion is made in this verse to the fact that he was characterised by prayer.<a name=107:4></a> Why should his prayers be ended?<a name=107:5></a> We have to enquire into this matter.<a name=107:6></a> David is clearly honoured by the Spirit of God calling attention to his prayers; as indeed all who pray characteristically are honoured.<a name=107:7></a> Solomon's prayer, recorded in <a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#8">1 Kings  8</a>, is the longest in Scripture, and God said to him, "I have heard thy prayer;" not only did God hear it, but as it was finished, He signalised it by filling with glory the house that Solomon had built.<a name=107:8></a> God so valued that prayer.<a name=107:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I mention these facts for our encouragement, that we may be marked by prayer.<a name=107:10></a> The Lord, the true Solomon and the true David, speaking to men said that "they should always pray and not faint".<a name=107:11></a> He is Himself seen praying, as you will remember, some ten times in Luke, mentioned there, no doubt, because priesthood is in mind.<a name=107:12></a> Priests are marked by prayer; we are a holy priesthood and should be marked by prayer.<a name=107:13></a> God honours us as praying; even the Lord Jesus Himself, as He was praying, was acknowledged from heaven, according to Luke, as the Father's beloved Son; and indeed it was "as he prayed", Luke says, that He was transfigured before His disciples; God thus honours prayer.<a name=107:14></a> Luke further tells us that one of His disciples asked Him to teach them to pray.<a name=107:15></a> Just after the narrative of His visit to Martha's house, he says, "And it came to pass as he was in a certain place praying,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I proceed now to show by the Lord's help, how these Psalms, 72 and 73, fit into the present moment -- the former referring to David's prayers ending, and the latter introducing his great musician and singer, Asaph.<a name=108:4></a> My remarks in the main will refer to these two great servants of God, having the service of God in the sanctuary in mind.<a name=108:5></a> Great stress has been laid upon it of recent years, and it will continue, for God is looking for the very best from His people at the present time.<a name=108:6></a> David and Asaph represent this; they represent in type the best that the Holy Spirit produces in the saints for God.<a name=108:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have other allusions of this kind to David, not in regard to his prayers but in regard to his words.<a name=108:8></a> The second book of Samuel records "the last words" of David -- a very formal statement (chapter 23).<a name=108:9></a> They allude to kingship.<a name=108:10></a> It is important that we should have the light of kingship at the present time.<a name=108:11></a> We are living in times foreseen in the book of Daniel, the time of the iron and clay, which do not mix.<a name=108:12></a> It is important, therefore, that we should have the light of kingship, which really hinges on sonship.<a name=108:13></a> The glory and lustre of royalty depend on sonship, so that <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2:6">Psalm  2:6</a>, 7 tells us of the Son and at the same time of God's King.<a name=108:14></a> "<i>I</i> have anointed my king upon Zion, the hill of my holiness".<a name=108:15></a> And then to the Son it is, "Thou art my Son; <i>I</i> this day have begotten thee".<a name=108:16></a> So that sonship and kingship go together.<a name=108:17></a> The Son is King, and hence the description that David gives us of kingship refers to Christ.<a name=108:18></a> David does not say that he was all that he says a king should be; he was not, nor could any mortal be all that a king should be.<a name=108:19></a>

		David's description is abstract, but it has a full concrete expression in Christ.<a name=109:1></a> He is all that could be desired in kingship.<a name=109:2></a> "The ruler among men shall be just, Ruling in the fear of God; And he shall be as the light of the morning, like the rising of the sun, A morning without clouds; When from the sunshine after rain, The green grass springeth from the earth" (<a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#23:3">2 Samuel  23:3</a>, 4).<a name=109:3></a> He is, in a word, a divine provision, <i>par excellence</i>, for man.<a name=109:4></a> It is what David says in his last words.<a name=109:5></a> If we have not David himself, we have his last words brought down to us by inspiration, and the Holy Spirit within us giving fulness to them, so that we should have kingship in our hearts and be able like the psalmist in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#45:1">Psalm  45:1</a> to say, "My heart is welling forth with a good matter: I say what I have composed touching the king.<a name=109:6></a> My tongue is the pen of a ready writer".<a name=109:7></a> It is a feature of moment in these modern times as they become more and more accentuated and every godly man is concerned.<a name=109:8></a> David's last words are intended to have a great place in our hearts that there is such a King, not simply a desire for Him, but the very King Himself in all His infinite greatness, the King of kings, sitting at the right hand of God.<a name=109:9></a> David's last words are to be honoured in our souls in the power of the Spirit, so that we might go through the maze of current political principles as they become more and more oppressive, and that we might be subject to the powers that be, whatever their character.<a name=109:10></a> At the same time, we should have the sense of victory in our souls in the apprehension of the King as described by David.<a name=109:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing that comes out in David's last words refers to young people.<a name=109:12></a> By the last words of David, the Levites were numbered from twenty years and upwards instead of twenty-five or thirty.<a name=109:13></a> In a typical sense young people are thus authorised to take part in assembly service five years earlier

		than was usual.<a name=110:1></a> That David should have thought of this in his last words is of great significance, especially as the statement is found in relation to the service of God.<a name=110:2></a> Let us read these scriptures as applying to ourselves.<a name=110:3></a> That is how we get the force of them.<a name=110:4></a> Let young people here read <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#23">1 Chronicles  23</a>, with the thought that it is written for <i>them</i>, that they have a right from God to take part in the assembly at an early age.<a name=110:5></a> It is as if the Spirit of God was thinking of you young people, even centuries ago, so that you should be free to take part as regulated by other scriptures in the divine service, beginning at twenty years of age.<a name=110:6></a> You will understand it is not literal, that it is a question of spiritual stature, and that the service of God in the land -- in the assembly viewed thus -- is less onerous than it is in the wilderness.<a name=110:7></a> That is the point that David makes.<a name=110:8></a> Young people, as believing in the Lord Jesus Christ, are sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise.<a name=110:9></a> Thus they are qualified to have part in the assembly, "in whom <i>ye</i> also have trusted, .<a name=110:10></a>.<a name=110:11></a>.<a name=110:12></a> having believed, ye have been sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, who is the earnest of our inheritance to the redemption of the acquires possession" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:13">Ephesians  1:13</a>, 14).<a name=110:13></a> Hence we are made sensible that we are the property of God.<a name=110:14></a> We are anointed, sealed, and have the earnest of the Spirit.<a name=110:15></a> These three things together make us rich in whatever part we have in the divine service.<a name=110:16></a> In type, all this is by the last words of David.<a name=110:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we come to his last prayer.<a name=110:18></a> This Psalm 72 presents Solomon to us.<a name=110:19></a> It is an extension of David's last words in which he describes what a king should be.<a name=110:20></a> Now he is praying about him, and so the psalm begins, "O God, give the king thy judgments, and thy righteousness unto the king's son".<a name=110:21></a> The king's son is in mind; it is as if David and Solomon sat together on the throne.<a name=110:22></a>

		They did sit together on the throne, as the Lord Jesus sits on His Father's throne.<a name=111:1></a> And so we are told that David made Solomon king.<a name=111:2></a> The chapter does not say he sat <i>actively</i> on the throne with his father, but he sat on it and we may be sure, graced it.<a name=111:3></a> He is the son, and it is as if in our psalm, David prayed for him at that time.<a name=111:4></a> He prayed for the king, but the king's son is in mind throughout the psalm.<a name=111:5></a> David says, "He will judge thy people with righteousness, and thine afflicted with judgment.<a name=111:6></a> The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the hills, by righteousness.<a name=111:7></a> He will do justice to the afflicted of the people; he will save the children of the needy, and will break in pieces the oppressor".<a name=111:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The whole psalm is about the king.<a name=111:9></a> Among many other things, we are told (verses 10 - 17), "The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall render presents .<a name=111:10></a>.<a name=111:11></a>.<a name=111:12></a> prayer shall be made for him continually; all the day shall he be blessed .<a name=111:13></a>.<a name=111:14></a>.<a name=111:15></a> His name shall endure for ever .<a name=111:16></a>.<a name=111:17></a>.<a name=111:18></a> all nations shall call him blessed".<a name=111:19></a> You see an enlargement of David's last words, but this is a prayer -- but a prayer of certainty.<a name=111:20></a> I bring it into the present moment because it really refers to Christ as He is now; it is the Solomonic character of Christ in view of the millennium, and that, I believe, is why we are told that the prayers of David are ended.<a name=111:21></a> Everything is now secured from the standpoint of kingship and is "Yea" and "Amen" in Christ.<a name=111:22></a> It is as sure as the foundations of the earth that every matter referring to government is finally reached in Christ.<a name=111:23></a> We may have to endure much, as the next psalm, the exercise of Asaph, shows, which I hope to enlarge on a little as applicable to us; but Psalm 72 is Christ as He is above in His Solomonic character.<a name=111:24></a> Every divine thought as to kingship, as to rule, is there infallibly.<a name=111:25></a> <i>We have nothing to ask for in that respect</i>.<a name=111:26></a> There is nothing to be added to what

		In looking at these scriptures, it is in view of considering divine dealings and operations, whatever form they may take, as having the assembly before us, particularly as in the plural sense -- that is <i>assemblies</i>, what we have been accustomed to name local assemblies.<a name=136:1></a> At the outset the thought was in the singular, that is, God operating in relation to what was at Jerusalem, and the Lord, in speaking of the assembly, viewed it that way.<a name=136:2></a> He spoke of it as <i>His</i>, and spoke of it as having administrative authority including the exercise of discipline.<a name=136:3></a> The singular idea prevailed in the early history of apostolic services.<a name=136:4></a> In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:47">Acts  2:47</a> the Lord is said to have "added to the assembly", and while it is doubtful if the word is in the original, the idea, however is there.<a name=136:5></a> The assembly is more than a number of christians: it involves building by the hand of the Lord, for He said, "I will build my assembly".<a name=136:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Spirit seems to have left the use of the word until something of this kind appeared in the apostolic service.<a name=136:7></a> The service of the twelve was generally foundational, for their names are in the foundations of the heavenly city, not in the general structure.<a name=136:8></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:31">Acts  9:31</a> uses the word in the plural, and although it is disputed by some authorities, it is maintained by others that the word <i>assemblies</i> should be there, and the New Translation has it.<a name=136:9></a> Clearly from the context, the plural thought is conveyed in the references to localities.<a name=136:10></a> It is not one assembly in so many places, but assemblies in these districts.<a name=136:11></a> In relation to Paul's ministry the word 'assemblies' is prominently used, as seen in the passages read, and in the revival in which we have part it has its full place.<a name=136:12></a> Thus we have the idea of local assemblies

	<div class="paragraph">
		In Acts 9 the time had come for it, the gospel having spread abroad, as we are told here, throughout all Judaea, Galilee and Samaria.<a name=137:2></a> The saints at Jerusalem were scattered, too, and about to enter on heathen territory, and assemblies were about to be established there also, as the sequel shows.<a name=137:3></a> Saul of Tarsus was ravaging the assembly, meaning the assembly at Jerusalem, but he had set out for other lands, to Damascus and Syria, armed with power to seize members of the assembly there as at Jerusalem.<a name=137:4></a> The Lord Jesus was watching all this intently; His lordship is stressed in this chapter.<a name=137:5></a> Saul was going too far, as agents of the devil usually do.<a name=137:6></a> It never fails that an agent of the devil discredits himself by want of wisdom.<a name=137:7></a> How can he have wisdom?<a name=137:8></a> Whatever he has is usually turned into foolishness, like that of Ahithophel.<a name=137:9></a> Saul went out from Jerusalem, "breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:1">Acts  9:1</a>): so that he was now in direct issue with the Lord.<a name=137:10></a> Was he stronger than the Lord?<a name=137:11></a> He asked that question later as an apostle -- are we stronger than He?<a name=137:12></a> (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10:22">1 Corinthians  10:22</a>).<a name=137:13></a> He discovered, perhaps more than anyone, how utterly impotent the creature is as having to do with the Lord.<a name=137:14></a> In grace He may allow us to prevail, as He allowed Jacob of old, so that Jacob could be ennobled, but Saul was not on that line.<a name=137:15></a> Heaven will not ennoble a man who is on the line of breathing out slaughter against the disciples of the Lord.<a name=137:16></a> So Saul was brought down, not destroyed, but brought down in grace, for he was to be imbued with the sense of grace.<a name=137:17></a> Perhaps he realised as no one else did, how that he was to carry it right through his preaching and his teaching and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have the word <i>vessel</i> in this and the next chapters, very significantly.<a name=138:3></a> In this chapter it refers to Saul, and in the next to the assembly; both are vessels, the assembly, of course, being the great abiding vessel for God.<a name=138:4></a> Saul is a vessel in the Lord's hands, as He says, "This man is an elect vessel to me" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:15">Acts  9:15</a>).<a name=138:5></a> He was thoroughly secured, and "increased the more in power, and confounded the Jews who dwelt in Damascus, proving that this is the Christ" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:22">Acts  9:22</a>).<a name=138:6></a> As a vessel, the apostle's heart was full of Christ.<a name=138:7></a> He preached Him as the Son of God at once.<a name=138:8></a> He escaped the enemy in the attempt to slay him at Damascus and arrives at Jerusalem, where he is introduced to the apostles by Barnabas, a man with great sympathy in the work of God.<a name=138:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Saul is sent away to Tarsus because the Jews in Jerusalem would have killed him as they tried to do at Damascus.<a name=138:10></a> He escaped their hands in both places, the brethren protecting him.<a name=138:11></a> He was there under the divine eye, and heaven was greatly occupied with that man, although not yet formally entrusted with a commission.<a name=138:12></a> He received his commission in relation to the assembly; not that the assembly gave it to him, but the Spirit of God in the assembly at Antioch commissioned him.<a name=138:13></a> The assembly is brought into it very significantly so that he and the assembly are bound up in a peculiar way henceforth.<a name=138:14></a> He is secured from the hands of Satan -- a wonderful triumph -- and the Lord is making it to operate in view of the assemblies, that they should be helped.<a name=138:15></a> So we have this verse: "The assemblies then throughout the whole of Judaea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being edified and walking in the

		The next thing in this chapter is that what heaven does brings about ministry confirming it, and carrying

	<div class="paragraph">
		it forward.<a name=140:1></a> It is important therefore that those who minister should be on the alert for what the Lord is doing from His side, to carry it forward and enhance it.<a name=140:2></a> And so we find Peter, who represents the ministry here, going "through all quarters".<a name=140:3></a> He sensed evidently that this was now the order of the day, so he goes through all quarters, knowing that the testimony is no longer to be confined to Jerusalem.<a name=140:4></a> No minister ought to be confined to any one place, not that he should not have a local setting, but he is not to be confined.<a name=140:5></a> He is to be universal as set in the assembly; his outlook and field of service are to be universal.<a name=140:6></a> Peter sensed this, so that he went to all quarters, indicating that there are no restrictions with God, for God is limiting Himself to no boundaries.<a name=140:7></a> Peter in his service goes to Lydda and he finds Aeneas lying on a bed where he had been for eight years.<a name=140:8></a> The ministry is now working out the idea of the assemblies, the thought is current, it is in the Spirit, the divine movements are universal, the outlook is universal.<a name=140:9></a> The great vessel, Paul, prepared specially for the service, is already in the field, but for the moment in abeyance, although soon to be sought out by Barnabas and brought to Antioch.<a name=140:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Peter for the moment is the leading minister, and my point in reading these verses to the end of chapter 9 is to show how the minister, without any formal directions, works out what was already in evidence.<a name=140:11></a> Peter has some sense of the truth now developing, and hence says to Aeneas, "rise up, and make thy couch for thyself".<a name=140:12></a> It is to bring out suitable local conditions.<a name=140:13></a> If local assemblies are to be useful to heaven, the conditions which Peter effected in these two towns must exist.<a name=140:14></a> The first is that those who are local must understand that they must do things for themselves.<a name=140:15></a> They may look further afield for help if necessary, because there is

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second feature is that the thing to be done must be done in a <i>living</i> way, not merely in a legal way as a matter of light, right doctrine, and principles; in the doing of things we want to have a living touch.<a name=141:8></a> Dorcas made garments, and no doubt made them well, but you cannot get life in garments, nor was it necessary for her to be converted to make garments -- I do not say she was not, but an unconverted person can make them.<a name=141:9></a> The women who were weeping, and showing Peter the garments Dorcas had made, cannot be said to have been assembly material, because Peter put them all out.<a name=141:10></a> But Peter was greatly concerned about Dorcas, and there can be no doubt that the Spirit of God records the facts as to her as containing instruction for the local assembly.<a name=141:11></a> The point is that these things should be living, and if things are living, that means love is there.<a name=141:12></a> Love is life, as <a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:14">1 John  3:14</a>, "<i>We</i> know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren".<a name=141:13></a> Spiritually, life is love in activity.<a name=141:14></a> Peter presented her living, that is the thought, there is now in Joppa a <i>living woman</i>.<a name=141:15></a> It is the feminine side, the subjective side of the assembly, whilst the objective side is seen in Aeneas -- such as would attend meetings for care, and do the necessary ruling or governing part.<a name=141:16></a> They are the people specially who ought to understand that they must do things for themselves, they must learn the mind of God for themselves, and know what to do in

		The next chapter, which we did not read, brings out the heavenly side of this matter in the assembly; the time had come for it.<a name=142:7></a> It lifts us out of time, for in truth this vessel, as it is called, is drawn up into heaven in a final sense.<a name=142:8></a> It is definitely said to come to the earth in this chapter.<a name=142:9></a> Peter says "it came even to me", because he had to understand it, and at the end it goes up again into heaven.<a name=142:10></a> Cornelius is a gentile, belonging to a band called Italic.<a name=142:11></a> How remarkable that the Spirit of God should bring this man forward at this juncture to set out in him the great heavenly thought!<a name=142:12></a> One feels the smallness of one's understanding as to the heavenly side of things.<a name=142:13></a> Cornelius in his own account says, "A man stood before me in bright clothing" (verse 30).<a name=142:14></a> The Spirit says that Cornelius saw "an angel of God coming unto him;" and Peter saw "the heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending, as a great sheet, bound by the four corners and let down to the earth".<a name=142:15></a> These visions point to what is heavenly and belongs to heaven: a vessel coming down and definitely returning to heaven, and remaining there.<a name=142:16></a> And what thoughts are in it -- "all the quadrupeds

		The passage in Genesis is to show how the assembly is to be reached as the bride of Christ; not here as the mother.<a name=155:2></a> It is one of the most interesting sections in Scripture, that is, as presenting the assembly, typically, as the object of Christ's affections.<a name=155:3></a> I read that one verse because it shows how the servant of Abraham brings in the idea of the way.<a name=155:4></a> "I being in the way, Jehovah has led me to the house of my master's brethren" (verse 27).<a name=155:5></a> "I being in the way".<a name=155:6></a> If we refer back in the chapter, we shall see what an exalted man he was.<a name=155:7></a> He is under oath to his master Abraham for one thing, to secure a wife for his son, from Abraham's family, and that he was not to take Isaac out of the land.<a name=155:8></a> It is a <i>heavenly</i> matter, one of the most exalted subjects you can treat of.<a name=155:9></a> The servant is thoroughly with his master, and I may say that if we are to reach the thought of the bride of Christ -- what the assembly is to Christ as the object of His affections -- we do well to look into the way of this servant.<a name=155:10></a> He takes ten camels of his master's.<a name=155:11></a> The servant is over everything that Abraham had, suggestive of the resources available to us in a spiritual sense as on this line.<a name=155:12></a> The resources are abundant, ten camels of his master's were enough.<a name=155:13></a> I want to show that the way is the way of prayer; how beautifully he prayed to God about this great matter.<a name=155:14></a>

		J.T.<a name=159:11></a> Well, the angel, and the facts relative to him, plainly indicate authority.<a name=159:12></a> It is, I suppose, because an angel is a known instrument in which God sets out His authority.<a name=159:13></a> "His angels mighty in strength .<a name=159:14></a>.<a name=159:15></a>.<a name=159:16></a> that do his will" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#103:20">Psalm  103:20</a>, 21).<a name=159:17></a> Characteristically they do the will of God.<a name=159:18></a> Here the facts are that "an angel of the Lord, descending out of heaven, came and rolled away the stone and sat upon it.<a name=159:19></a> And his look was as lightning, and his clothing white as snow.<a name=159:20></a> And for fear of him the guards trembled and became as dead men".<a name=159:21></a> It seems to me that those facts, mentioned as they are, unmistakably stress the idea of authority.<a name=159:22></a> Then the angel says, after speaking to the women (verse 7), "Behold, I have told you".<a name=159:23></a> He speaks with authority.<a name=159:24></a>

		Now as regards Luke, I believe his account would help us as to the great subject that is being so stressed amongst us, namely, the service of God in the assembly.<a name=173:12></a> In chapter 24: 3 we have, "And when they had entered they found not the body of the Lord Jesus.<a name=173:13></a> And it came to pass as they were in perplexity about it, that behold, two men suddenly stood by them in shining raiment".<a name=173:14></a> We are often in perplexity about things, and constantly, of course, questions are being asked which should be answered, but I believe this scripture would help us to find the truth, each finding it for himself.<a name=173:15></a> "As they were in perplexity about it, that behold, two men suddenly stood by them in shining raiment".<a name=173:16></a> That is, the answer is not going to be deferred.<a name=173:17></a> The two men are there suddenly, but it is as we are in perplexity about things, as we are really concerned, because these women were persons of reality.<a name=173:18></a> Verse 1 says, "on the morrow of the sabbath, very early indeed in the morning".<a name=173:19></a> This shows that they are people of sacrifice, sacrificing ease and comfort for the great things before them, and now being in perplexity, they have not to wait long before their perplexity is dispersed.<a name=173:20></a> Clarification is a feature in Luke.<a name=173:21></a> "Two men suddenly stood by them in shining raiment".<a name=173:22></a> The same thing is seen in chapter

		S.McC.<a name=244:12></a> What do you understand by the change in the way of speaking here?<a name=244:13></a> Firstly God sends His servant Isaiah, saying to him, "Go out now to meet Ahaz .<a name=244:14></a>.<a name=244:15></a>.<a name=244:16></a> and thou shalt say unto him".<a name=244:17></a> In verse 10 Jehovah spoke again to Ahaz; also in verse 13.<a name=244:18></a> "Hear then, house of David".<a name=244:19></a>

		J.T.<a name=244:20></a> Well, it is God speaking Himself.<a name=244:21></a> No doubt all was through a prophet, but still, God speaks Himself directly.<a name=244:22></a> The Holy Spirit says at Antioch, "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul", but through whom He spoke we are not told; but it was the Spirit Himself.<a name=244:23></a> So Paul says, "The Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city, saying that bonds and tribulations await me".<a name=244:24></a> Through whom did He witness?<a name=244:25></a> No doubt a brother would be employed in each city, as at Caesarea.<a name=244:26></a> Of course, to one who has the Spirit, God can speak directly, but prophetic messages, as in the case of Ahaz, are usually through others.<a name=244:27></a> But the great point is that God is speaking; it is the voice of God, and it makes it all the more serious for Ahaz.<a name=244:28></a> It is God speaking directly to him.<a name=244:29></a>

		The first thing, I think, is <i>how</i> we go through the pressure; and how God will make use of it for us.<a name=276:9></a> It is a question of how we go through it; whether we seek to shirk it, minimise it, or ignore it altogether.<a name=276:10></a> Do we face it as a possible ordering of God to bring out what there is of Himself?<a name=276:11></a> The work of God is to stand.<a name=276:12></a> We have had much light, enjoyed much ministry in meetings like this, but what is the result, the actual product?<a name=276:13></a> God would bring that out; so that one would be free to pray for the enlargement that enters into the pressure, and also for relief, if it please God.<a name=276:14></a> Hezekiah obtained both the enlargement and the relief.<a name=276:15></a> The tidings of the attack of Rabshakeh caused Hezekiah to rend his garments and cover himself with sackcloth.<a name=276:16></a> He did not at first go to the Lord directly; he sent a message to Isaiah, the messengers themselves being covered with sackcloth, asking Isaiah, among other things, to "lift up a prayer for the remnant that is left" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#37:4">Isaiah  37:4</a>).<a name=276:17></a> He gets an immediate answer, though brief.<a name=276:18></a> Isaiah answers, "Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.<a name=276:19></a> Behold, I will put a spirit into him, and he shall hear tidings, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land" (verses 6, 7).<a name=276:20></a> That is the immediate answer to the first request for a prayer.<a name=276:21></a> Then the Assyrian sends another message to Hezekiah

		(verse 10); and in verse 14 we are told that "Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it; and Hezekiah went up into the house of Jehovah, and spread it before Jehovah.<a name=277:1></a> And Hezekiah prayed to Jehovah, saying, Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, who sittest between the cherubim, thou, the Same", (that title "the Same" is not in the authorised version; it is an abiding name of God) "thou alone art the God of all the kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made the heavens and the earth.<a name=277:2></a> Incline thine ear, O Jehovah, and hear; open, Jehovah, thine eyes, and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib, who hath sent to reproach the living God".<a name=277:3></a> And then, having gone over what the Assyrians would do, he says, "And now, Jehovah our God, save us out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art Jehovah, thou only" (verse 20).<a name=277:4></a>

		Now, we see clearly here that the pressure has its own effect.<a name=277:5></a> Hezekiah does not pray in the first instance; he asks the prophet to pray, which he did; and Isaiah gives an immediate answer, which would bring immediate relief for his spirit, and assurance as to God's ways in the matter.<a name=277:6></a> The second message by the letter of the king of Assyria brings out enlargement in Hezekiah.<a name=277:7></a> He has moved on in his soul, and been enlarged under pressure, for he now enters, himself, into the house of God and he lays the matter before Jehovah.<a name=277:8></a> Indeed, he speaks and acts almost as his father David did after Nathan's message came to him.<a name=277:9></a> He went in and spoke to God.<a name=277:10></a> That indicates great increase in spirituality.<a name=277:11></a> That is what is before us.<a name=277:12></a> The pressure continuing results in enlargement, if we face it.<a name=277:13></a> So that we advance from sackcloth; there is no sackcloth as he enters the house of Jehovah the second time (verse 14); we advance from that in the service of God.<a name=277:14></a> Thus

		ENDINGS OF THE GOSPELS (1)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Matthew 28: 1 - 20
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=294:1></a> The thought for these readings is to take up the endings of the four gospels; Matthew speaking of <i>authority</i>, Mark of <i>faith</i>, Luke of <i>grace</i> and John of <i>spirituality</i>.<a name=294:2></a> The leading thought in Matthew is delegated authority; the authority of God in Christ, and then by the Spirit in the assembly.<a name=294:3></a> We have kingship stressed in this gospel.<a name=294:4></a> Christ is presented from the outset as the Son of David, and David is called "the king".<a name=294:5></a> David's kingship is thus stressed; and even such as Herod is called the king several times; however unfaithfully he ruled, he was called king.<a name=294:6></a> We have also the <i>Great King</i> mentioned in this gospel, and on the holy mount "his face shone as the sun".<a name=294:7></a> Other like expressions are to be found in Matthew, for Christ is seen exercising kingship or authority by the Spirit; also delegating it to the assembly, according to chapter 18.<a name=294:8></a> It is thought that this final chapter will serve to show how authority is also in Christ risen and exalted.<a name=294:9></a> His ascension is not spoken of here, but He <i>commands</i> the disciples.<a name=294:10></a> The angel is seen descending out of heaven and rolling away the stone and sitting on it.<a name=294:11></a> The authority of heaven is thus in evidence at the sepulchre -- for the moment vested in this angel, who instructs the disciples as to the resurrection of Christ.<a name=294:12></a> The ascension is omitted, for it is a question, in this gospel, of authority based on moral grounds, rather than what is conferred.<a name=294:13></a> The latter, however, is stated in chapter 28: 18, but not as in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:33">Acts  2:33</a> -- He "having therefore been exalted by the right hand of God .<a name=294:14></a>.<a name=294:15></a>.<a name=294:16></a>" "All power .<a name=294:17></a>.<a name=294:18></a>.<a name=294:19></a> in heaven and upon earth" is given to Him in a personal sense.<a name=294:20></a> The angel says, "I have told you" (verse 7), as if the authority is imperative.<a name=294:21></a> And finally the Lord says, "All power has been

		given me in heaven and upon earth".<a name=295:1></a> And He says further, "Behold, <i>I</i> am with you all the days;" hence our position here this afternoon.<a name=295:2></a> We are entitled to regard that the Lord is with us as moving in obedience and in the light of the commandments.<a name=295:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		L.E.<a name=295:4></a>S.<a name=295:5></a> Is your thought that the position occupied by the assembly according to Matthew is to be held in authority and power here, so that there is an answer to the chaotic conditions that are all around?<a name=295:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=295:7></a> Yes; the conditions are certainly chaotic, although God is mercifully maintaining government.<a name=295:8></a> In some instances it is in the hands of men who are misusing it, but still God is maintaining government.<a name=295:9></a> The feature of the great image of <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#2">Daniel  2</a>in the last days is the iron and clay, which do not mix, and God is concerned that in the assembly, in the few who are walking in the light of it, there should be a testimony to government and order.<a name=295:10></a> Matthew, I think, is intended to teach us and enlighten us as to this, and to show that the Lord is with us, and with us always, until the end.<a name=295:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.R.<a name=295:12></a>T.<a name=295:13></a> Is this authority represented in the angel, the authority out of heaven -- in contrast to the authority that Pilate assumed, and which the Jews recognised?<a name=295:14></a> The previous chapter says, "Pilate commanded the body to be given up" at the request of Joseph; and the Jews say, "Command therefore that the sepulchre be secured;" there was certain authority with Pilate.<a name=295:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=296:15></a> Authority was there, and the Lord recognised it, even as against Himself.<a name=296:16></a> It was not given to Pilate to be used against Christ, but the fact that he was in the place of authority is owned by the Lord.<a name=296:17></a> Abstractly Pilate was right, for he would have released the Lord; as uninfluenced by the Jews he would have set Him free, but through the influence of the Jews he handed Him over to be crucified.<a name=296:18></a> He surrendered his trust, yet he did not lose the authority, and the Lord owned that he had it.<a name=296:19></a>

		J.T.<a name=338:1></a> It has already been remarked that this gospel sets out grace, particularly this chapter.<a name=338:2></a> Because of this, priesthood has great prominence, not so much in word, but in fact.<a name=338:3></a> The features of the priest run through this gospel, and are particularly seen here in the way the Lord instructs and blesses.<a name=338:4></a> While we have read only part of it, the thought is to look at the whole chapter.<a name=338:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two men at the tomb.<a name=338:6></a> "Behold, two men suddenly stood by them in shining raiment" (verse 4).<a name=338:7></a> The priestly service is seen in this, so as to meet the perplexity in which the women were found.<a name=338:8></a> That is, the women are in mind.<a name=338:9></a> It is said at the end of verse 4, that two men "stood by them", showing that <i>they</i> are in mind; hence, as we shall see throughout the chapter, the need of the saints is met by priestly grace.<a name=338:10></a> The state is not viewed as so marked by unbelief as in Mark.<a name=338:11></a> The work of God is seen, although it is somewhat beclouded.<a name=338:12></a> Verse 5 says, "And as they were filled with fear and bowed their faces to the ground, they said to them, Why seek ye the living one among the dead?<a name=338:13></a> He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spoke to you, being yet in Galilee, saying, The Son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinners, and be crucified, and rise the third day.<a name=338:14></a> And they remembered his words".<a name=338:15></a> That is, their case is quite hopeful.<a name=338:16></a> They are ready to take in instruction immediately.<a name=338:17></a> They remembered the Lord's word, and "returning from the sepulchre, related all these things to the eleven and to all the rest".<a name=338:18></a> Luke presents a hopeful side, and so in like circumstances we ought to look on the hopeful side, and not be too gloomy about difficulties.<a name=338:19></a> There is always a solution.<a name=338:20></a>

		Then another thing that comes out, confirming what has been said, is that, although it is said, "their words appeared in their eyes as an idle tale, and they disbelieved them", yet "Peter, rising up, ran to the sepulchre".<a name=339:1></a> That shows that the more hopeful side is seen here.<a name=339:2></a> Peter is concerned about the state of the sepulchre, and "stooping down he sees the linen clothes lying there alone, and went away home, wondering at what had happened".<a name=339:3></a> It is hopeful when one is taking account of things that are intended to indicate the work of God.<a name=339:4></a> John will tell us more about this matter of the state of the sepulchre.<a name=339:5></a> Luke agrees more with John in this respect, as Mark agrees more with Matthew.<a name=339:6></a>

		This matter of the preposition, I think we ought to bear in mind, because in Matthew 28 the Lord is telling the disciples to <i>make</i> disciples; a very remarkable feature that runs through Matthew; for christianity carries authority with it, not only the authority of commission, but power to effect things.<a name=431:5></a> So that the Lord says, "All power has been given me in heaven and upon earth.<a name=431:6></a> Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations".<a name=431:7></a> Christ <i>was</i> what God intended men to become, and the apostles were themselves to be what the nations were to become, that is, <i>disciples</i>.<a name=431:8></a> In preaching the gospel or serving the saints, I must be the thing I intend them to be.<a name=431:9></a> If I have taken on the character of Christ, I want them to take on the character of Christ.<a name=431:10></a> So Paul says, "Be my imitators, even as I also am of Christ" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:1">1 Corinthians  11:1</a>).<a name=431:11></a> He was what he intended them to be.<a name=431:12></a> We can see at once that christendom is not that, it is not a reproduction of Christ, or the apostles; it is spurious.<a name=431:13></a> So the word <i>make</i> here is to be noticed.<a name=431:14></a> With what power He invested the apostles, so that they should make disciples of all nations!<a name=431:15></a>

		J.T.<a name=489:4></a> Quite so.<a name=489:5></a> The earlier account is by the prophet John himself, "I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands; and cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb".<a name=489:6></a> That is a formal statement by John; the white robes and the palm branches indicate their moral state; the palm branches alluding to victory.<a name=489:7></a>

		J.T.<a name=489:10></a> The blood of Christ has cleansing power: it cleanses us from all sin (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#1:7">1 John  1:7</a>).<a name=489:11></a> As I said, it is not merely an historical statement -- it <i>is</i> historical -- but it has a moral bearing.<a name=489:12></a> "These are they who come out of the great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and have made them white in the blood of the Lamb".<a name=489:13></a> The tense would show that the thing is done, it is completed.<a name=489:14></a> In the first chapter the Lamb, the Lord Himself, does it for us, He "has washed us from our sins in his blood".<a name=489:15></a> The last chapter of the book speaks of those who wash their robes, without mentioning the blood, they wash them, they do it, but here the blood is used by this great multitude.<a name=489:16></a> It is said in chapter 7 that "These are they who come out of the great tribulation, and have washed".<a name=489:17></a> The word <i>come</i> is characteristic showing that they are of that class -- <i>the comers out</i> of the great tribulation.<a name=489:18></a> They have not succumbed.<a name=489:19></a> They are continuously characterised as having come out of it: they are not overwhelmed in it.<a name=489:20></a> The washing is mentioned as in keeping with all this.<a name=489:21></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=490:11></a> Believers happily ascribe their redemption to Christ, the washing of course having its own force, and primarily He does it; but in this case, I think the stress is on their intelligent use of the testimony of the death of Christ, because the use of the blood is a question of accepting the testimony to the death of Christ.<a name=490:12></a> There is the Spirit, the water and the blood -- "they that bear witness are three".<a name=490:13></a> The Spirit is the witness, and the water, and the blood.<a name=490:14></a> "It is the Spirit that beareth witness", and in our case He brings to bear upon us the testimony of the death of Christ which is the water and the blood; the cleansing by the blood of Christ being judicial, and the water being moral, dealing with our <i>state;</i> so that it is an intelligent appropriation of the blood of Christ, the death of Christ, for cleansing.<a name=490:15></a> I think it denotes an advance on chapter 1, in the understanding of these persons, although chapter 1 covers this as to the value of the blood.<a name=490:16></a> The believer readily ascribes praise to Christ for everything, only the Spirit would stress what we do in intelligence, as feeling the need of the blood.<a name=490:17></a>

		I go on to Joshua briefly.<a name=517:5></a> He was near Jericho, the seat of the enemy's power, and "he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, there stood a man before him with his sword drawn in his hand.<a name=517:6></a> And Joshua went to him, and said to him: Art thou for us, or for our enemies?<a name=517:7></a>" The use of the words 'us' and 'our enemies' indicated that Joshua was in a somewhat low condition.<a name=517:8></a> We quickly look around for supporters if we are in an issue.<a name=517:9></a> Do not support any side in a matter.<a name=517:10></a> This man with the drawn sword is not going to support a side.<a name=517:11></a> He says, "No; for as captain of the army of Jehovah am I now come".<a name=517:12></a> In principle we do not make the Lord's people our adversaries: I have no issue but Christ, no one else.<a name=517:13></a> Then it says, "Joshua fell upon his face to the earth, and worshipped, and said to him, What saith my lord unto his servant?<a name=517:14></a>" All impressions from God are to return to Him: if a reaction is right it will be toward God.<a name=517:15></a> God is to be enriched as a result of His gracious ministry, and thus Joshua is changed to a worshipper.<a name=517:16></a> This Man is Christ Himself as Captain of the army of Jehovah.<a name=517:17></a> He came to test them, to see where they were, whether they were thinking of God or of their own side.<a name=517:18></a> Now is the time for the Captain to take charge; we have to learn that everything is in His hands, and that

		Finally I would call attention to Solomon's reaction in 1 Kings 3.<a name=518:6></a> The account in Chronicles does not give so much credit to Solomon as this does.<a name=518:7></a> Here it says, "Solomon awoke, and behold, it was a dream.<a name=518:8></a> And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah".<a name=518:9></a> It does not say that in Chronicles; there it is: "Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen .<a name=518:10></a>.<a name=518:11></a>.<a name=518:12></a> And the king made silver and gold in Jerusalem as stones" (<a href="../bible/2Chronicles.htm#1:14">2 Chronicles  1:14</a>, 15).<a name=518:13></a> You might go back to your good business, but that is not a good reaction.<a name=518:14></a> God is pleased with Solomon's answer to "Ask what I shall give thee", and He says in effect, 'I will do more for you'.<a name=518:15></a> The reaction to this is that Solomon is so impressed that he stood before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah and offered.<a name=518:16></a> He stands before the ark which typifies Christ come down in love.<a name=518:17></a> Christ is to dwell in our hearts by faith; it is a question of the love of Christ and the operation of faith: "being rooted and founded in love" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:17">Ephesians  3:17</a>).<a name=518:18></a> Solomon is there and the ark of the covenant is there.<a name=518:19></a> As the angel said to Mary, "<i>He</i> shall be great, and shall be called Son of the Highest" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:32">Luke  1:32</a>).<a name=518:20></a> Solomon offered up burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, suggestive of fellowship.<a name=518:21></a> If we retain what we get now we shall be equal to the next occasion,

		I have in mind to speak about limitation.<a name=520:1></a> I began with the book of Job, a book that is intended to help saints and sinners, and amongst the things employed of God are several features of creation that are mentioned in this chapter; the verse read alludes to ice.<a name=520:2></a> It comes in under the head of Elihu's discourse.<a name=520:3></a> There had been the discourse of Job himself, and the discourses of his three friends.<a name=520:4></a> Job's discourse was always self-commendatory; there was not another like him, he thought, in the world.<a name=520:5></a> And the speeches of his friends were condemnatory of him, balancing his own eloquent speeches of self-commendation and self-praise.<a name=520:6></a> Then we have Elihu's speeches, calling attention to God in His works; and finally, we have Jehovah's own direct speeches or discourses to Job; the great Creator and Upholder of all things graciously spoke to call attention to some of the things He had created so as to bring one man to conviction of his own state and to show the interest of God in every one of us.<a name=520:7></a> He succeeded with Job, and Job wisely in the course of his experience stopped talking.<a name=520:8></a> It says, "The words of Job are ended;" and so room is made for the evangelist, the representative of God, to say something.<a name=520:9></a> He did not join in with the three friends; it would have made a fourth.<a name=520:10></a> He waited for all of them to finish; then he had a clear field.<a name=520:11></a> And that is exactly how God has set the gospel so that He has room to speak to men, shutting up every mouth.<a name=520:12></a> God waited long and allowed men to speak.<a name=520:13></a> In the days of our Lord Jesus Christ, who served on earth here as a Man, He allowed men to speak, to say anything to Him and He answered them, sometimes not saying anything.<a name=520:14></a> But He was ready to answer

		Now Elihu, as I said, comes in as having a clear field to speak to Job, and he uses hundreds of created things, as it were, as texts; and he uses the idea of frost.<a name=521:13></a> He points out that God has in the creation wonderful instruments for dealing with men.<a name=521:14></a> Thank God, for the present time is a time of good, not evil!<a name=521:15></a> And He has these great things.<a name=521:16></a> He has the thunder that startles you when you hear it; and not only the noise, but the flashes come, stirring up your feelings and calling you to attention.<a name=521:17></a> You cannot but be called to attention as the thunder roars and the lightning flashes.<a name=521:18></a> Elihu does not fail to call attention to these things.<a name=521:19></a> And then he uses remarkably the snow, for instance, in verse 6.<a name=521:20></a> "Fall on the earth", God said to the snow.<a name=521:21></a> You say, It is simply snowing.<a name=521:22></a> What is the 'it'?<a name=521:23></a> Who is doing it?<a name=521:24></a> God says to the snow, "Fall on the earth".<a name=521:25></a> It is
