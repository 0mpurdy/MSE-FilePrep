		I have the scriptures in Corinthians especially in mind, and have read in the Old Testament to amplify, and perhaps clarify, what is said there by the apostle.<a name=17:1></a> The scriptures taken together treat of the idea of a field, that is a portion of the earth which is set apart as profitable, which may be sown in and reaped with a view to a crop.<a name=17:2></a> The thought of a field has a wide and varied meaning in Scripture.<a name=17:3></a> In <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13:38">Matthew  13:38</a>, for instance, it is said to be the world, so that it is very wide, the world viewed as capable of cultivation, capable of receiving seed and producing a crop.<a name=17:4></a> Then we find it also as containing treasure secured by purchase, so that rights are acquired over it.<a name=17:5></a> Then we find it in many other connections, that is as characteristic of what is convertible, the beasts of the field.<a name=17:6></a> We find, as already alluded to today, the field of Ephron, a field that commands peculiar interest as, whilst it is a burying-place, it points to resurrection.<a name=17:7></a> A wide area is secured, at least an area called a field, called that several times, and the trees in it, all that was in it secured with care, money paid out for it, a testimony as we have already had today to the power of God, whilst it has the grave too, in the light of the death and resurrection of Christ, who as it is said, annulled death and brought life and incorruptibility to light through the gospel.<a name=17:8></a> That is the field, whether it be where the saints as together bury a loved one, or whether it be whence the saints who are buried come forth at the quickening word of Christ to resurrection, to life.<a name=17:9></a> The Lord through redemption has rights, which He now uses in respect of the burial of loved ones, for they are all His, His dead, but as "the section of the bush" proves, as He called it Himself,

		it is the life realm, all live to Him, He says.<a name=18:1></a> God is not the God of the dead but of the living, so they are all as good as raised.<a name=18:2></a> Faith understands that and that field will glow in life and glory as the Lord Jesus descends from heaven and awakes the sleeping saints and changes the living.<a name=18:3></a> No one will see anything, the whole scene will be dominated by the power of God; no power can cope with that and we shall go up without any molestation or hindrance.<a name=18:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there is the field of Hanameel which Jeremiah bought, pointing to the future when fields and vineyards shall be bought and sold and the title-deeds secured.<a name=18:5></a> There are no title-deeds mentioned in regard to the purchase of the field of Ephron, but it is a public matter.<a name=18:6></a> We are told the price secured; it is a public matter secured to Abraham, secured to faith; in other words it cannot be infringed upon or interfered with, a matter that should be in our hearts as we bury our dead.<a name=18:7></a> The field of Hanameel, on the other hand, is sealed by writing, part sealed and part open.<a name=18:8></a> The deeds, as I may call them, are lodged in an earthen vessel, no doubt alluding to the living saints today who have the treasure in earthen vessels, keeping every thought of God in their hearts; whether for themselves or for Israel all the promises are yea and amen in Christ, cherished in the hearts of the saints now, so that the title deeds of the field are always secure.<a name=18:9></a> Everything thus is viewed, dear brethren, for us; victory is in all these things, but it is all a matter of faith, faith sustained in life by the power of the Spirit of God.<a name=18:10></a>

		These two fields, as I said, present certain features, but the verses I have read refer to the saints, the saints viewed as a field, or husbandry.<a name=18:11></a> Husbandry is a similar thought, an area cultivated by God, and in which He is operating.<a name=18:12></a> Even in a debauched worldly city like Corinth God would have what He regards as His husbandry treasured.<a name=18:13></a> No one can infringe upon

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, I want to comment on the verses in the Old Testament so as to lead up to this point, so that the brethren may see, whether it be in Cambridge or any other city or town or village where the saints are, that God has His husbandry.<a name=19:4></a> As the Lord Himself says in another setting, "My Father is the husbandman", a very solemn fact and yet very comforting, for a father suggests, grace, and yet severity.<a name=19:5></a> Love indeed must be severe where there is that which damages; it is not love to treat lightly that which may be in the child or the saint and which damages the vineyard or the husbandry.<a name=19:6></a> It is not love at all.<a name=19:7></a> There must be skill in the way love acts, but love will act with the utmost severity, as the apostle says, "I would that they would even cut themselves off who throw you into confusion".<a name=19:8></a> So the Lord announces to Paul, "I have much people in this city".<a name=19:9></a> That is what He alluded to, He had them, not yet actually, but potentially; that is to say, it was like a field, as I hope to show in a moment, a field prepared of the Lord.<a name=19:10></a> There is the smell of it, not yet a crop, but the smell, known to God, of a field that was to be fruitful.<a name=19:11></a> Now these remarks bring me to <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#27">Genesis  27</a>, a well-known scripture and one which fits peculiarly in what I have in my mind; one may touch, in dealing with it, on the individual believer, in the manner in which Isaac regards his son.<a name=19:12></a> The affection conveyed in Isaac's invitation to his son is touching, and I need not remark that it is not a mere historical matter, but one to be used at any time, bearing indeed directly on us, for these two men so prominent in the chapter are,

		as the sequel shows, the true or real brother and the false brother.<a name=20:1></a> This thought runs down the Scriptures from Genesis to Malachi, and indeed from Matthew to the Revelation, the thought of the genuine brother and the false brother.<a name=20:2></a> A comparison of the blessing will help us; the scripture says that Isaac blessed them both by faith, but a comparison of the blessing will show how the one is the real brother and the other the false, although Esau had every opportunity as every normal brother does.<a name=20:3></a> Heaven spares nothing that would help him, to make him real, so that Esau is blessed but he is not kissed, he is not said to be kissed, nor is he called near, and his blessing is just what he should have without any thought of giving, whereas Jacob's blessing is all a question of gift.<a name=20:4></a> Esau shares in great advantages in the fatness of the earth and the dew of heaven, but says Isaac, "It shall come to pass when thou rovest about, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck", that is Jacob's yoke.<a name=20:5></a> "When thou rovest about" meaning what we call loose or independent brothers.<a name=20:6></a> I am not saying they are not christians; I am only speaking of the character of roving about, no submission to heaven, or ordering by heaven; none takes his place by divine appointment, thus each becomes independent; he breaks off the appointed yoke, which is very common in our days, a thing to be avoided.<a name=20:7></a> Is anyone here on the line of roving about?<a name=20:8></a> It is a warning; you may think you have got liberty but it is simply independence.<a name=20:9></a> On the other hand Jacob is called near by faith, for now Isaac is in the full position of faith and blesses, as representative of God.<a name=20:10></a> He draws near, how touching for young people, how God would call you near.<a name=20:11></a> "Come near .<a name=20:12></a>.<a name=20:13></a>.<a name=20:14></a> my son".<a name=20:15></a> Then he says, "See, the smell of my son", a word that has to be quoted because smell is a matter of great sense and helps as to decisions, the smell you find.<a name=20:16></a> Here it is the smell of a field which the Lord has blessed, that

		is to say it is a christian, it is a christian acting in the divine nature, not yet perhaps having the crop in view, but potentially the thing is there.<a name=21:1></a> "The smell of my son is as the smell of a field which Jehovah hath blessed", pointing to a future crop, and what a crop!<a name=21:2></a>-the crop is sure to come.<a name=21:3></a> And in the end we have the solemn fact that Esau is hated; there is no crop.<a name=21:4></a> Jacob is loved.<a name=21:5></a> "I loved Jacob", alluding to what came out in his history, whereas Esau is hated, alluding to what came out in him.<a name=21:6></a> He had every opportunity to bear a crop, for God is wonderfully gracious to Esau making provision for him, as in the book of Deuteronomy he was not to be touched, but later the prophetic history denounces him.<a name=21:7></a> No nation is more denounced; we see God's hatred of falsity among brethren.<a name=21:8></a> So there is urgency that young brothers and sisters should see to it that there is the evidence initially, in our faith, of the blessing of God, that is to say that kind of blessing which ensures a crop and makes you worth while for the virtuous woman to add you to her territory.<a name=21:9></a> It says, "A woman of worth" in Proverbs; she considers a field, she does not take on any field.<a name=21:10></a> Esau was a man of the field but he is not said to be a field which the Lord has blessed; a common man, he is not himself a field.<a name=21:11></a> The point is today whether the person himself is a field, that is what Jacob was.<a name=21:12></a> Faith makes the person himself a field, something that God can cultivate with a view to the crop.<a name=21:13></a> There is always seed-time, and seed-time is utterly worthless unless there is harvest time, seed-time and harvest.<a name=21:14></a> Sowing seed, except we get a harvest, is futile, and there is no harvest except the field is blessed of the Lord.<a name=21:15></a> There must be the latent power and activity in the field and that can only be by the work of God; so the virtuous woman considers the field.<a name=21:16></a> That is, the brethren enquire about anyone who seems to be blessed of the Lord; she considers a field and then acquires it, not joining

		These remarks I think you will see, dear brethren, connect with the verses I have read in Corinthians, which verses contemplate the idea that I am speaking of, husbandry, or a farm, or a field, as collective, the saints collectively, not an individual but the saints as a whole in that town, and what brings the subject up in the apostle's mind is that there were partisan conditions in Corinth; such are wholly inimical to the idea of a crop.<a name=23:10></a> What can you have with such conditions?<a name=23:11></a> Where partisan conditions exist the door is open for the enemy; there were wicked persons in that meeting; it was in a vile state, so that the apostle is led on to speak about this matter of husbandry by the fact that some in the place were saying that they were of Paul, and others of Apollos, or perhaps other names which he does not use.<a name=23:12></a> Now Paul planted, that was all he did in this respect, a great work, of course.<a name=23:13></a> The Lord had told him that He had much people in that city, that is He had husbandry in His mind and Paul was to sow the seed which would bring in the crop, and the crop would come.<a name=23:14></a> It was a very fine work and took eighteen months, I suppose; the idea was to

	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish to speak about the idea of a name as it is seen in the Scriptures, and of how, as regards God and as regards ourselves as believers, it enters into God's house.<a name=62:1></a> The idea of a name is, as it were, stamped on the house.<a name=62:2></a> I hope to show how it applies to every believer from the divine standpoint.<a name=62:3></a> The name of each is called as he is baptised; he is baptised "to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit".<a name=62:4></a> The great thought of name is before him as seen in a divine Person in revelation.<a name=62:5></a> His own name is mentioned, but only in a potential way, for before baptism there can be little worth naming in the believer.<a name=62:6></a> What is in the divine mind, which is to be developed always, corresponds with the great thought of the name as presented-"the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit".<a name=62:7></a> The thought of the name connects powerfully: the nations are to be baptised unto it.<a name=62:8></a> The nations have each their men worthy of distinction and renown, and their names have a great place in the nation as unregenerate, but baptism implies that they are now regarded in their true light; that is of no value morally.<a name=62:9></a> The believer would never seek a place nationally.<a name=62:10></a> The idea in baptism is another world.<a name=62:11></a> God always had the idea of a world in His mind, it has taken form already in Christ, involving renown, and a name according to God.<a name=62:12></a> So all our thoughts as to name are henceforth, as baptised, to be in that relation.<a name=62:13></a> God's world takes form now in the house of God, which is a provisional thought, and belongs to circumstances relating to us; it affords present enjoyment of what we go on to finally.<a name=62:14></a> All the features of that world are to be known now in the house.<a name=62:15></a> I may say here, that

	<div class="paragraph">
		baptism does not of itself introduce into the house, but it introduces into the realm in which that name is prominent, the divine name, for there is only one name, that of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit; it does not say names (see <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28:19">Matthew  28:19</a>).<a name=63:1></a> Baptism introduces into that, and it sets the believer up in that relation; he finds what the name means for his own soul.<a name=63:2></a> The Lord says, "I have made known to them thy name, and will make it known", it is one thing to be baptised unto the name, and another that it should be made known by the One who alone can make it known, that is the Son.<a name=63:3></a> "I have made known to them thy name, and will make it known"; that is, there should be absolute certainty that it is made known in us; and then He adds, "That the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them", <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:26">John  17:26</a>.<a name=63:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The believer is thus brought into that which is the highest order of love, namely, the love the Father has for the Son; <i>that</i> kind of love is to be in them, "the love with which thou hast loved me", and correspondingly He adds and "I in them".<a name=63:5></a> The Lord is in us, in our affections as thus known, in such an exalted love as that, that which the Father has for the Son.<a name=63:6></a> We are able to love the Son in some measure as the Father loves Him: it is that kind of love.<a name=63:7></a> Therefore, dear brethren, that is the way the name comes out, it stands in relation to love; everything must work back to that, to what God is.<a name=63:8></a> Each of us acquires a name of distinction in that way, and what a variety there would be, each having his own distinction; I want you to take that in to begin with.<a name=63:9></a> Christianity began with the assertion that there were a certain number in the upper room in Jerusalem, "The crowd of names who were together", not a number of believers, or saints, or brethren, but of <i>names</i>.<a name=63:10></a> Everyone had a distinction, and that is what is meant in the salutations in the epistles, as bringing out the distinctions in the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=64>[Page 64]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		brethren in each locality, that distinction being the outcome of love shown in some particular way.<a name=64:1></a> If I do not love I am nothing; if I do love, it is noted in heaven.<a name=64:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to show you how all that worked out in Genesis, so that we may see how we come into the realm of love, which is the house, where these great thoughts have their fulness.<a name=64:3></a> You will remember how the thought of name arose with Cain.<a name=64:4></a> We have the thought of the giving of names from the very beginning of creation: "the darkness he called Night" and so forth, but when we come to man, He "called their name Adam", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#5">Genesis  5</a>a.<a name=64:5></a> That is said of the man and the woman: He "called their name Adam".<a name=64:6></a> But as yet there are not exploits or distinctions acquired through exploits; Cain begins that; he built a city and the idea of name comes into evidence, for he called it after the name of his son.<a name=64:7></a> There you get the germ of the word, in the idea of a man calling a city after the name of his son, and that thought runs on to Babel, where men said, "Let us make ourselves a name".<a name=64:8></a> Over that God writes <i>confusion</i> "Therefore was its name called Babel"-confusion.<a name=64:9></a> Men give titles but there is nothing moral, nothing that deserves the recognition of heaven in them.<a name=64:10></a> Christians aspiring to them just add to the confusion.<a name=64:11></a> If a christian aspires to something to which a man who has no regard for God aspires, see the company he is in!<a name=64:12></a> Confusion is written over it, whether it applies to a christian or an unregenerate man.<a name=64:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So you get the idea first with Cain, then with the progeny of angels and the daughters of men; these were the men of renown, the heroes of ancient times.<a name=64:14></a> Men have searched into these things, and have spent their lives to establish facts in regard to these matters, but the further to the root of them we get, the more objectionable they are found to be, the less fit to be named in the mouths of holy men and women.<a name=64:15></a> "These

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=65>[Page 65]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		were the heroes, who of old were men of renown", men whose names were revered and even worshipped down the ages, but whose origin is enough to show anybody how unfit they are to be regarded by those who love Christ.<a name=65:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we find the thought carried through to Babel, the idea showing that collectively what is seen in every nation in the way of patriotism and nationalism has to be discounted, along with the other names of which I have spoken; baptism requires it.<a name=65:2></a> "Let us build ourselves a city and a tower, the top of which may reach to the heavens; and let us make ourselves a name".<a name=65:3></a> There was no thought of going through into heaven, it was simply for conspicuousness; and God has written Babel, confusion, over it.<a name=65:4></a> That is enough for the christian.<a name=65:5></a> He comes to see negatively that divine distinction is not confusion.<a name=65:6></a> You leave all that which is marked by Babel behind, and enter upon that which is marked by divine order.<a name=65:7></a> Although the word 'crowd' is used by the Spirit in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>, in connection with names, it is no discredit to the hundred and twenty; heaven has put honour on every one of them, that is how it will be in eternity; each will be marked off by the evidence of love, and the work of God in them.<a name=65:8></a> However great the number, and it will be great, there will be no confusion.<a name=65:9></a> Everyone will be like Christ, but everyone will have his own distinction and be recognisable, so there will be no confusion there.<a name=65:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Commencing with the name given to the city we have the use of names according to God on moral grounds; there are names given creationally, and there are names that come out in a moral sense.<a name=65:11></a> Seth calls his son's name Enosh, that is no distinction, he is just a frail, mortal man; there is no distinction.<a name=65:12></a> What intelligence that implies!<a name=65:13></a> That is where baptism fits in; he would claim no distinction.<a name=65:14></a> Graveyards show that death is very callous and makes nothing of men.<a name=65:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Enosh is a landmark, dear brethren, and each of us has to understand what it means: mortal man, dying man.<a name=66:1></a> There is no distinction.<a name=66:2></a> And the scripture adds, "Then people began to call on the name of Jehovah", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#4:26">Genesis  4:26</a>.<a name=66:3></a> It is a matter of no distinction, <i>people</i> began to call on the name of Jehovah.<a name=66:4></a> The name of Jehovah is set over against a name that means nothing as regards distinction!<a name=66:5></a> That is an epoch, you begin there: "Then people began"; it is on the divine calendar.<a name=66:6></a> That particular time was the beginning of a great era, when man, hitherto dark, had begun to call on the name of Jehovah.<a name=66:7></a> I hope everyone here understands that we have to call on that name, for that is where we begin to get distinction, and a distinction that runs on into eternity.<a name=66:8></a> It is implied in baptism.<a name=66:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then as you come down the line you come to Shem, who was contemporary with the men of renown spoken of in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#6">Genesis  6</a>.<a name=66:10></a> His name means 'name or renown', it is something; and his father's name was something, for Noah means 'rest'.<a name=66:11></a> Shem means renown but not as we have been speaking of it in connection with Cain and Babel.<a name=66:12></a> Shem was the second son of Noah, he was said to be the brother of Japheth the elder, and Ham was the youngest.<a name=66:13></a> I want you to notice that, dear brethren, because the line of Shem includes all the names of glory in relation to Abraham's line; so that the name given to him was substantial; there was something there.<a name=66:14></a> Shem led in the hiding of his father's nakedness, an important matter in this thought of name.<a name=66:15></a> Anyone given to exposing, or criticising, or making little of the brethren, or doing or saying anything that discredits the brethren is unworthy of a name; that name shall perish.<a name=66:16></a> Shem was the opposite of that, and so we find that when the genealogies are given with Japheth and Ham, Shem's is given last in chapter 10, but then it is given by itself in chapter 11.<a name=66:17></a> That is to say, the true idea of

		name is brought in by the Spirit of God as Babel is written on all else.<a name=67:1></a> We want to get on to that line, dear brethren, and remain in it, there is renown and increase in it: "Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Shem", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#9:26">Genesis  9:26</a>.<a name=67:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to dwell upon how it works out in Jacob, that is the manner in which it is worked out in each believer.<a name=67:3></a> Jacob is the believer viewed as difficult to manage; every true believer says, 'That is I, difficult to manage'.<a name=67:4></a> You must never say a brother is beyond managing; he may be difficult, but he is not too difficult for God.<a name=67:5></a> Alas!<a name=67:6></a> for him if he is especially difficult.<a name=67:7></a> Jacob was a difficult man and his family was a difficult family, yet you get the house of God in connection with him.<a name=67:8></a> It is as if God would say, 'Difficult as he is, I will make him a trophy to shine in My house'.<a name=67:9></a> But then he has got to come to it that he is a difficult man.<a name=67:10></a> The most difficult man is the man who has not come to it; but Jacob did come to it.<a name=67:11></a> There is no time to go into details, but he came to it that he was a very difficult man, a man making a name for himself by riches, a man who went into business to build a name for himself.<a name=67:12></a> Jacob did that for twenty years; he went into business and was successful in business.<a name=67:13></a> But then success in business will never give you a name in the house of God; it will only detract from any little spirituality you may have.<a name=67:14></a> So when Jacob came back from Padan-aram, he sent a message to his brother and gave him an inventory of his wealth.<a name=67:15></a> The messengers returned to Jacob and told him that Esau was coming to meet him with four hundred men, which did not bode any good for Jacob!<a name=67:16></a> The great wealth of Jacob could be of no avail when Esau met him with four hundred men.<a name=67:17></a> So God meets Jacob, and He cripples him.<a name=67:18></a> That is what I want to speak of, dear brethren; a man may spend twenty years and make great wealth, and come back with it with the thought that it will add something to

		J.T.<a name=79:9></a> That is what this book does-it discerns between a brother marked by appreciation for what is of God and by lovableness, and a brother who is governed by natural propensities, which Esau represents.<a name=79:10></a> God has given us an extended public history of Edom, and He finishes up with this terrible word, "I hated Esau"!<a name=79:11></a> It is not arbitrary, because he was hateful, whereas Jacob was lovable and God loved him.<a name=79:12></a> It is a question of lovableness in the true brethren, and hatefulness in the false brethren.<a name=79:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=79:16></a> Yes, that is the point.<a name=79:17></a> The Lord takes the matter up in Matthew; He takes it up immediately on the mount, and says, "If therefore thou shouldest offer thy gift at the altar, and there shouldest remember that thy brother has something against thee, leave there thy gift before the altar, and first go, be reconciled to thy brother", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#5:23">Matthew  5:23</a>, 24.<a name=79:18></a> The Lord takes up the subject immediately, showing how Matthew links on with the Old Testament.<a name=79:19></a> It is a question of giving a brother every opportunity if he has something against you; you are to try your utmost to secure him: "Be reconciled to thy brother".<a name=79:20></a>

		In regard to the remaining features of this book, the Spirit of God calls attention to the gross negligence, you might say profanity, in the way the things of God were dealt with in Israel; but in spite of this God calls attention to His love for them and His preference for them.<a name=82:12></a> There is the love of preference as well as the love of sovereignty.<a name=82:13></a> God preferred Jacob, and He regards this little remnant at the end of the Old Testament as worthy, He treats them with the greatest respect, and not merely the remnant but the nation itself, although they were marked by the grossest disregard of the rights of God in their service to Him.<a name=82:14></a> Chapters 2 and 3 deal with that, the priests especially being taken up in chapter 2.<a name=82:15></a> In the presence of that God says, "From the rising of the sun even unto its setting my name shall be great among the nations; and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure oblation: for my name shall be great among the nations, saith Jehovah of hosts".<a name=82:16></a> That is very comforting, God will have His rights answered to, and it is our privilege now to answer to them.<a name=82:17></a>

		facts to us in Scripture to elucidate a certain thought.<a name=95:1></a> There is a thought conveyed here in the message sent to David which inspired in his heart the sense of liberty with God.<a name=95:2></a> God tells him, "Thy seed .<a name=95:3></a>.<a name=95:4></a>.<a name=95:5></a> it is he who shall build a house for my name"; if David's seed was to be a son, there was some encouragement for him in that.<a name=95:6></a> The Holy Spirit tells us in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#89">Psalm  89</a>that David was a son.<a name=95:7></a> God says, "<i>He</i> shall call unto me, Thou art my father, .<a name=95:8></a>.<a name=95:9></a>.<a name=95:10></a> I will make him firstborn", of course the allusion is to Christ, but nevertheless in principle it referred also to David.<a name=95:11></a> So he gathered up the promise; it is a great principle in the things of God to be able to gather up things, to get impressions and move in them.<a name=95:12></a> A divine impression is calculated to move me, what I do immediately after receiving it proves where I have got.<a name=95:13></a> So it tells us that David went in and sat before the Lord.<a name=95:14></a> It is the only place where we are told that he did this.<a name=95:15></a> Speaking is stressed here, and I call attention to it as the first feature of sonship characteristically.<a name=95:16></a> As the light of it comes into my soul by the Spirit I am adjusted, and the next thing is liberty; I have liberty with God.<a name=95:17></a> Many of us are bound in our souls, unable to speak to God in the assembly.<a name=95:18></a> I do not mean we are ashamed, but we are unable to speak to God as He should be spoken to, in the power of the Spirit.<a name=95:19></a> The Holy Spirit is down here in order to serve us in every possible way, and one way is that we might learn to speak to God, to cry "Abba, Father".<a name=95:20></a> That is in principle what comes out in David.<a name=95:21></a> He "went in and sat before Jehovah".<a name=95:22></a> It does not say that Jehovah sent for him; that would be another matter; if Jehovah had sent for him as His servant, he would go in and stand and await orders, that is what properly belongs to the servant: he awaits orders standing.<a name=95:23></a> We are not told what David entered into here, the point is he went in; it is the inwardness of the thing.<a name=95:24></a> That is to say, dear brethren, we have got to learn to

		The next feature I would dwell upon is in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:14">Romans  8:14</a>.<a name=96:9></a> If I get the light of sonship in the period in which I am, the next thing is that I move in it in the spirit of adoption, and then I am to be led.<a name=96:10></a> The movements of David are not suggestive of the movements of the Spirit, they are his own movements; he moves of himself.<a name=96:11></a> But then there is such a thing exemplified in Scripture as a person moving by the Spirit.<a name=96:12></a> We have it in the Lord Jesus Himself, He was "led by the Spirit in the wilderness", according to <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4">Luke  4</a>.<a name=96:13></a> It concurs exactly with what comes out in the types; according to <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21">Numbers  21</a>when Israel recognised the well, they sang, "Rise up, well!<a name=96:14></a> sing unto it", and after that they moved.<a name=96:15></a> The type answering to what I am speaking of is divinely fulfilled by the Lord Himself, and now by ourselves, in the measure in which we understand being led of the Spirit.<a name=96:16></a> So Israel went from point to point, pursuing a straight course until they reached mount Pisgah.<a name=96:17></a> There is nothing said about the ark, or the tabernacle, or the cloud; they had reached new ground, that is to say, the ground of inward acknowledgment of the presence of the Spirit of God.<a name=96:18></a> They moved on until they reached the top of Pisgah, which as it says, "looks over the surface of the waste", <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21:20">Numbers  21:20</a>.<a name=96:19></a> On the other hand, it looks outward on the land,

		Colossian saints.<a name=182:1></a> They were a very remarkable company, like Laodicea, which place Paul had apparently never visited, but he had agonised about the saints there.<a name=182:2></a> What is needed is that sort of thing, dear brethren, to get the saints into life by placing them where the Lord lay, so to speak.<a name=182:3></a> And so I would point out that this remarkable woman is equal to this experience.<a name=182:4></a> She was promised this boy, and she had him presented as the prophet says, "Thou shalt embrace a son"; he knew what that would mean to her heart, not simply 'You will have him', but, You will "embrace a son".<a name=182:5></a> A son is worth embracing; a woman is not worthy of the name of a mother if she does not embrace a child; it is the affections that are proper, and especially in a spiritual sense; to embrace is the expression of affection.<a name=182:6></a> "And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.<a name=182:7></a> And he said unto his father, My head, my head".<a name=182:8></a> This boy is in a serious condition, it is a head condition.<a name=182:9></a> Young men and women should take notice of this, because our heads are very often much in advance of our feet; I know that well; each of us knows it.<a name=182:10></a> And the father's side could do nothing; he knew enough, however, to send the child back to the mother; he was promised to the mother, not to the father.<a name=182:11></a> What is to be done is to be done by her; it is all a question of the development of the truth.<a name=182:12></a> Here is a great woman, she is devoted to the testimony, what is to be done for her?<a name=182:13></a> Give her a son, she is to embrace a son; that is spiritually, dear brethren, the assembly; you can see the force of it, the supreme object of affection.<a name=182:14></a> But there is this trouble, and the father sends him to his mother by the hand of a lad-it is a youthful state of things-and the mother takes him on her knees and he dies at noon; when he should be in vigour, he dies; when we should hope, death comes in-these are sorrowful considerations!<a name=182:15></a> What exercises the people of God

		<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#108:1">Psalm  108:1</a> - 9
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This psalm, as possibly some may be aware, is partly taken from the earlier <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#57">Psalm  57</a>and <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#60">Psalm  60</a>, which are in the second book.<a name=187:1></a> They are historical psalms, in the sense that they bring into view certain circumstances in David's history in regard to his sufferings, lending great interest to them; for the sufferings of David thus foreshadowed the sufferings of Christ in which we are privileged to have part.<a name=187:2></a> The repetition of certain passages in the psalms would remind us of the resetting of precious stones; they shine, they retain their lustre in every setting, but especially in their final setting as in this last book of Psalms.<a name=187:3></a> They refer to fineness of thought, which should not be foreign to us as christians; indeed, as partaking of the heavenly calling, we are to "judge of and approve the things that are more excellent", to compare and define what is excellent and what is more excellent.<a name=187:4></a> The more excellent a thing is, the more it can be employed in testimony, whether it is by a christian, or in the Word itself.<a name=187:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The same excellence and variety seen here is found throughout the Scriptures, so that we may have the same thought in Romans or Colossians or Ephesians, but the setting is different in each epistle.<a name=187:6></a> Timothy was sent to Corinth to represent what was spiritual amongst persons who were far otherwise, and hence he is selected for a mission to Corinth, under circumstances of peculiar difficulty, not only for what he could say, but for what he was.<a name=187:7></a> Were we to see that man sitting in Corinth at the reading meeting, we should be affected by his whole deportment, how he would sit and how he would speak.<a name=187:8></a> And in the Lord's own service in the synagogue at Nazareth, the

	<div class="paragraph">
		Spirit dwells on His movements, His personal movements, then on His words, then on His mouth; the words He speaks are "gracious words".<a name=188:1></a> The same words, of course, would be gracious on the lips of the saints, but they are particularly so in connection with the lips of Christ: no setting could be greater than that.<a name=188:2></a> "His mouth is most sweet"; there is no mouth like it; the setting of the quotation from <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#61">Isaiah  61</a>in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4">Luke  4</a>, is therefore unique.<a name=188:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So these sections of the Psalms set together here are to be considered as to what the setting signifies.<a name=188:4></a> It is the last book of the Psalms; a book full of jubilance, which, though having its own place in the testimony, is arrived at by the way of David's sufferings and rejection.<a name=188:5></a> This fifth book is full of buoyancy, spiritual buoyancy, ending up with Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah!<a name=188:6></a> So that praise is the leading thought of this book, and I believe what was included in the praise which accompanied the institution of the passover, and the inauguration of the Supper by the Lord, was taken out of this book.<a name=188:7></a> So while these earlier psalms have to be understood in their setting in relation to the sufferings of Christ, that is, the sufferings of David entering into them, it is not so here in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#108">Psalm  108</a>.<a name=188:8></a> The point is not suffering here, but the outcome of suffering; and so though the setting in the first place is in relation to the suffering, the jewel of praise retains its radiance and beauty in other settings.<a name=188:9></a> The outcome of sufferings, beloved brethren, will appear in eternity, not necessarily as connected with the sufferings, but as the product of the suffering.<a name=188:10></a> The lustre and value of the psalms is thus secured eternally.<a name=188:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the psalmist here begins with the statement, "My heart is fixed, O God".<a name=188:12></a> We are often very vacillating, and in a sense nothing is more required than fixity with us, but when everything comes clearly into view as in relation to Christ, then you fix your
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=189>[Page 189]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		heart and say, "My heart is fixed, O God; I will sing, yea, I will sing psalms, even with my glory".<a name=189:1></a> This is, I think, what God is doing at the present time among many other things, He is bringing about fixity, steadfastness and stability in us.<a name=189:2></a> Aside from this the testimony in our hands must lose lustre at times, for we are liable to become discouraged, and dejection is a discredit to the position, but as we see all things clearly established in Christ, we are fixed.<a name=189:3></a> Clarity of view is one of the greatest things needed.<a name=189:4></a> Part of the Lord's great service in Matthew is to give His disciples clear perspective; He took them on high for that.<a name=189:5></a> On the level things were exceedingly weak, but He took them up and the perspective is clear, and <i>He</i> is the centre of the picture.<a name=189:6></a> You see Him impressing the principles of His kingdom in chapters 5, 6 and 7, the Lord standing out in great majesty, so that the disciples understood; and as they descend there is a certain fixity in their affections and in their minds, which is what the Lord intends.<a name=189:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So in this <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#108">Psalm  108</a>, there is this fixity, as you will observe, not as in the earlier psalms where great need existed, but the heart being fixed, he says, "I will sing psalms, even with my glory.<a name=189:8></a> Awake lute and harp: I will wake the dawn".<a name=189:9></a> There is a great suggestion there of what can be brought about in great persons as the outcome of sufferings.<a name=189:10></a> It seems as if the psalmist had in mind that whatever the darkness of the night, he would be there in His praise with the awakening of the morning.<a name=189:11></a> That is pre-eminently seen in the Lord Jesus on the morning of the resurrection, and He will yet come out with healing in His wings in a coming day; but I refer to what is here, to show the great thought of His securing this praise for God; and surely great thoughts belong to us: no other family of any of the families of God should be more capable of great thoughts than the saints today!<a name=189:12></a> John would press that, the greatness of the saints, that

		<a name=190>[Page 190]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		it needed the great persons to bring in the great thoughts of God.<a name=190:1></a> So here these thoughts are Godward, as if he would wake the dawn, the glorious morning with songs of jubilee; like the birds in nature who awake the dawn with their songs.<a name=190:2></a> How beautiful is this suggestion of life showing itself in this variety in the praises of the believer in the dawn of the morning!<a name=190:3></a> How suggestive all this is!<a name=190:4></a> How stimulating to our hearts!<a name=190:5></a> Lest we should be looking to the west and the setting sun, instead of to the east and the sunrising.<a name=190:6></a> When the church comes into view we look towards the east!<a name=190:7></a> The tabernacle looked toward the east.<a name=190:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have suggestions in some of the psalms of David as to what he would do.<a name=190:9></a> His influence extends, as the influence of the christian is extending, but his thought is not to exalt himself, but to exalt God.<a name=190:10></a> God gave him victory among the nations by which he secured right of way for his brethren, but in it all his desire was not to make himself great, though it did make him great, but to exalt God.<a name=190:11></a> God does widen our influence if we are faithful, but the thought here is to celebrate God in the saints.<a name=190:12></a> So he says, "I will give thee thanks among the peoples, O Jehovah; of thee will I sing psalms among the nations: for thy lovingkindness is great above the heavens, and thy truth is unto the clouds.<a name=190:13></a> Be thou exalted above the heavens, O God, and thy glory above all the earth.<a name=190:14></a> That thy beloved ones may be delivered".<a name=190:15></a> Now, dear brethren, this is a very important matter, for there are so many needing deliverance; the enemy is attacking in various places amongst us, holding people in bondage, hence the need of deliverance for hundreds of our brethren.<a name=190:16></a> How can we deliver them except in buoyancy, spiritual buoyancy?<a name=190:17></a> As it says, "That thy beloved ones may be delivered: save with thy right hand, and answer me".<a name=190:18></a> We see the exalted feelings of the psalmist, dear brethren, "Be thou exalted above the heavens".<a name=190:19></a> God
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=191>[Page 191]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		loves that thought!<a name=191:1></a> Jesus has gone beyond all that, "ascended up above all the heavens", but faith loves to see Him there, exalted above the heavens, for the service of man.<a name=191:2></a> So that there are results from the glory on high for the deliverance of the brethren.<a name=191:3></a> They are all dear to Christ, "the Lord knows those that are his".<a name=191:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the following verses from verse 7, are what God says: "God hath spoken in his holiness".<a name=191:5></a> The point is to emphasise that the speaking is in holiness; I speak now of what is unfolded in these verses, that is, God coming in and asserting His rights.<a name=191:6></a> There are different international settings among men which are always difficult, because it is all a question of man's selfish will.<a name=191:7></a> The believer learns that they have to surmount their selfish interests, that there is such a thing as superiority to international considerations; but that is "not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith Jehovah of hosts".<a name=191:8></a> The mountain may seem insuperable; it may indeed be called "great", but God says, "Who art thou, O great mountain?<a name=191:9></a> before Zerubbabel thou dost become a plain".<a name=191:10></a> That is, nothing is impossible as we recognise the rights of God in Christ; everything gives way before the power of the Spirit.<a name=191:11></a> So that in our service we can look north, south, east and west, and the Lord has right of way everywhere.<a name=191:12></a> That is, dear brethren, the testimony is secured; the affections of the saints are widening and becoming universal instead of national.<a name=191:13></a> "The eyes of Jehovah run to and fro through the whole earth"; He is Lord of all the earth, and He asserts His rights; He has right of way there-a very great fact.<a name=191:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So here we find God speaking in His holiness and saying, "I will exult, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth" (verse 7).<a name=191:15></a> It is the blessed God full of holy buoyancy in what He is doing.<a name=191:16></a> He has got the right to man, and He exerts that right with joy; He rejoices over His saints with joy: as it says

		elsewhere, "He will rest in his love; he will exult over thee with singing".<a name=192:1></a> He is full of exuberance, and we, as it were, enter into His enjoyment.<a name=192:2></a> What He says is, "Gilead is mine, Manasseh is mine".<a name=192:3></a> That is God speaking, that is what He says in His holiness; He is in perfect consonance with the psalmist.<a name=192:4></a> It shows how God comes in and identifies Himself with us, that is victory indeed for those who serve, to see that God is working.<a name=192:5></a> So He says, "I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth", no one can stand in My way!<a name=192:6></a> Can anyone say to Him, This is my territory?<a name=192:7></a> Presently the Lord Jesus will come down from heaven, as a mighty angel, and will set His foot upon the sea, and His left foot on the earth, and who can say Him nay?<a name=192:8></a> Shechem and Succoth?<a name=192:9></a> He has rights there.<a name=192:10></a> However difficult the position, He has got rights there: "Gilead is mine, Manasseh is mine, and Ephraim is the strength of my head"; it is as if God would allude to the wisdom of His people, they are "the strength of my head".<a name=192:11></a> He has got that; He has got something here, and we want to be in that to which He alludes here, whether it be Gilead or Manasseh or Ephraim.<a name=192:12></a> They all belong to God who is exalted above the heavens; that is elevation, and He speaks in holiness.<a name=192:13></a> Then He says also that He has got a lawgiver, that is Judah.<a name=192:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then finally, He has a "wash-pot" in a place of reproach, that is Moab, but it is useful.<a name=192:15></a> It is not what we might call a refined thought, but it is very necessary.<a name=192:16></a> We all know what Moab stands for: "We have heard of the arrogance of Moab-he is very proud", but God may use even an abominable element like pride for our purification; He can turn it into a wash-pot, a means of purification.<a name=192:17></a> And then, "Upon Edom will I cast my sandal", as if He could do anything with that.<a name=192:18></a> Edom is the haughty brother, but who can say nay to what God does?<a name=192:19></a> And so, "Over Philistia will I shout aloud"; that speaks of the great

		Now I wish to make Zion plain especially for our younger brothers and sisters here and indeed for all the children, for the more one looks into Scripture the more one sees that the children, however young, are intended to have part in the greatest things along with the elders.<a name=237:4></a> They learn to appreciate the great things as they are represented by the older ones and as it is seen how they are valued.<a name=237:5></a> We learn in school best; I may say a classroom is the best place of instruction, learning together.<a name=237:6></a> Also as regards eating and drinking, it is much better to eat and drink with others than by ourselves, not that it is not necessary at times to eat and drink by ourselves, but the Lord intimates clearly enough that what He means in christianity is eating and drinking collectively.<a name=237:7></a> That is what the Lord's supper means.<a name=237:8></a> No one could take part of it by himself-it is a collective thought and we eat and drink constitutionally, as also in the way of enjoyment.<a name=237:9></a> I always, I may say simply, partake of a meal with much more relish and profit in the company of the brethren whether at my own table or at others'.<a name=237:10></a> And so, as I said, the little ones are to share the greatest things of God with the older ones.<a name=237:11></a> So that the Scriptures say constantly, referring to the greatest things in the Scriptures, that your children will ask you about these things.<a name=237:12></a> They will ask you about them.<a name=237:13></a> The segregation of children in instruction is very questionable; the instruction that is best for them is in relation to the older ones.<a name=237:14></a> The children of

		<i>Notes of a Care Meeting with Mr.<a name=277:1></a> James Taylor arising out of a matter in which a sister living in 'A' married one not walking with us, although known to be a believer, and absented herself from the meeting at 'A' for a period of some twelve months</i>.<a name=277:2></a>
	</div>

		Enquiries were made as to her whereabouts and she was subsequently found to be living in 'B'.<a name=277:3></a> Individual brethren at 'A' endeavoured to get into touch with the sister but their letters were ignored.<a name=277:4></a>
	</div>

		The brothers in care at 'A' decided to announce to the saints that having absented herself from the breaking of bread before leaving 'A' and being apparently unapproachable by any of the brethren, she could no longer be considered in fellowship.<a name=277:5></a> It was considered unnecessary to have an assembly meeting, as this was regarded, not as the case of a "wicked person", but rather that of a weak soul, not having faith to go on in a path in which she was never established.<a name=277:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The brothers at 'B' felt that the Lord would lay on <i>them</i> the responsibility of dealing with the case in accord with the principle laid down in <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#20">2 Samuel  20</a>.<a name=277:7></a> Having finally left 'A' and settled in 'B', the sister was now within their gates, like Sheba the son of Bichri in going to Abel, where the people of that city dealt with him effectively.<a name=277:8></a> This was duly communicated to the brothers at 'A'.<a name=277:9></a>

		Then we come to this same Abraham in bereavement, and bereavement is sure to overtake each of us, and what comes out into view here is another section of the inhabitants of the land, the sons of Heth; the Philistine, the big man of this world religiously, had already spoken to him, had recognised the heavenly man as great; that is, he recognised that God was with him.<a name=287:12></a> Now the sons of Heth had a burying place to sell, and we see the bereaved heavenly man who calls Sarah, "my dead".<a name=287:13></a> You may be sure he felt bereavement more than any of the sons of Heth would feel it.<a name=287:14></a> It is the heavenly man alone that feels bereavement aright.<a name=287:15></a> Jesus supremely felt it; He wept.<a name=287:16></a> It is the reflection of the heavenly, feeling things aright in a seemly way.<a name=287:17></a> Abraham makes no show here, but he feels he lost Sarah.<a name=287:18></a> He calls her, "my dead"

		Then in chapter 26 we have Christ.<a name=288:4></a> Isaac is a type of Christ, and a type of the christian too, but he is a type of Christ.<a name=288:5></a> We say he is a type of Christ as the heavenly man, but that is not enough; Abraham is characteristically, distinctively the heavenly man; Isaac is the heavenly man, but he is the heavenly man officially, as if God would say, 'You must have the heavenly man before you can have the official, before you can have witnesses here in the testimony'.<a name=288:6></a> That is what comes out in Genesis.<a name=288:7></a> It is the heavenly side; christianity inaugurated by Paul; "Such as the heavenly one, such also the heavenly ones"; but then the sheet comes down from heaven, knit at the four corners.<a name=288:8></a> It is the heavenly crisis: Peter on the house top became in a trance, and saw this wonderful vision; it was Christ, the true Isaac, operating officially now to bring the heavenly into the vision of the minister down here.<a name=288:9></a> That is what is in mind, and there is going to be true greatness, great things in this man.<a name=288:10></a> So we have first of all that he sowed in that land (chapter 26: 12).<a name=288:11></a> The heavenly man is going to produce something from his own sowing.<a name=288:12></a> It is to be a heavenly crop, as it were; God is so particular about this.<a name=288:13></a> He fills these chapters with this heavenly thought, so that it is the Christ; it is the Christ that took out Paul, and sent down the sheet; it is Christ in His official capacity in heaven, and the assembly here in the tent of Sarah.<a name=288:14></a> It is not the assembly in heaven; we have the suggestion that the assembly is of heaven, but here in testimony; it is heavenly in

		So that as Joshua begins to operate in bringing the people into Canaan, Jehovah says, "This day will I begin to magnify thee", and in this verse he has done it.<a name=292:3></a> He magnifies Joshua, we are told, in the sight of all Israel.<a name=292:4></a> Abraham was magnified in the sight of the Philistines, and so was Isaac, but now it is in the sight of all Israel; it is a question of Christ as the Head spiritually; it is in the sight of all Israel.<a name=292:5></a> The people look on spiritually; Christ is to be magnified.<a name=292:6></a> I do urge this; it will be the solution of many difficulties, if Christ comes into your vision in this way, if you are able to take your stand in relation to all Israel, and see that Christ is operating to get your feet on the solid ground of resurrection, as Paul says, "If any way I arrive at the resurrection from among the dead", <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3:11">Philippians  3:11</a>.<a name=292:7></a> He was aiming at that, that he might get his feet on the solid ground of divine purpose in the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=292:8></a> So that as Joshua operates on these lines, it says, "On that day Jehovah magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they had feared Moses, all the days of his life".<a name=292:9></a> He acquires a place in the soul; and it is a great steadying power when Christ acquires a place from this point of view; that is, the point of view of Joshua, so that we feel we are moving, maybe like a glacier, slowly on to the side of divine purpose, and the sure ground of the resurrection of Christ.<a name=292:10></a> That is the only solid ground there is, Christ in resurrection.<a name=292:11></a> There is the ascension too, but the power of Jordan, the waters of Jordan are driven miles away up stream, so that the people went over on dry ground.<a name=292:12></a> It is a question of the power of God, that the waters are cut off, and all Israel passes over.<a name=292:13></a> I commend this part, because I believe it is less understood

		Beginning with Abel and right down through the types, one person is outstanding in each epoch and such affords an object for faith, as typical of Christ.<a name=297:1></a> So faith is tested in an object, one object for undivided attention; that is what is in the mind of God; He would draw that out in us.<a name=297:2></a> One could cite many instances, even in hostile instances, when it was said of Christ, that the eyes of all were fixed on Him.<a name=297:3></a> And what has been said suggests all this.<a name=297:4></a> Moses became an object, even for the many persons who did not go with him, but specially for those who sought the Lord.<a name=297:5></a> Others stood in the doors of their tents, and looked after him, but that leaves us in our tents, where we may be surrounded with idolatrous or other influences.<a name=297:6></a> They stood in their tent doors and looked after him, for one who is representing God here below is capable of affecting even such people; and yet it adds nothing to them at all, save that it makes them more responsible.<a name=297:7></a>

		And so this section begins with the idea of the business of a certain man, the fishing business.<a name=298:3></a> It is one of the fishing scenes of the Scriptures, and the Lord is seen entering into it in the beginning of the chapter.<a name=298:4></a> It says, "And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret, and saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nets.<a name=298:5></a> And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's".<a name=298:6></a> Now this is a remarkable scene, for the Lord is engaged in His own fine that He came here for.<a name=298:7></a> He is "The Word" Himself, and is engaged with the word of God, we are told.<a name=298:8></a> He was never deflected in the least from His own proper service by any incident.<a name=298:9></a> The Lord was always engaged with what should engage Him, the word of God here.<a name=298:10></a> Many were present to hear; it was evidently an interesting time, and the Lord takes advantage of two empty boats, boats that had been used well, used profitably.<a name=298:11></a> Their owners, or the fishermen, were gone out of them, it says, and were washing their nets; that is, they were clean business-men, as we might say, for as in a business centre like this unless this cleanness affects us, we shall not be available for what the Lord is engaged in.<a name=298:12></a> We may turn aside in the evening several times a week, or perhaps not more than once a week -- business would hold us otherwise perhaps.<a name=298:13></a> But here, although Simon was evidently one of those washing the nets, well employed, he was not far away.<a name=298:14></a> The boat was under his eye, and as the Lord entered to use it, he was ready to take part in what the Lord was

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I speak of all that, dear brethren, so that it might come to us in our setting here, because whatever the business may be, it is to be washed; it is sure to affect the brethren unless it is washed; so that the proof of superiority to it is that I am ready to join with the Lord in what He is doing.<a name=299:16></a> It is not what you are doing, you are washing your nets, and doing well, but it is what the Lord is doing.<a name=299:17></a> He is setting forth the word of God, and that is what I am to do.<a name=299:18></a> I am to leave my end of all my matters; whatever I have, and allow the Lord liberty there, and He will have liberty there, and what an honour it is that He should wish, dear brethren, that there is nothing to repel Him in my business circumstances.<a name=299:19></a> Peter is ready.<a name=299:20></a>

		Now I just mention all these things briefly to suggest all this, and the result of the Lord's coming into one's circumstances in this way, really, as I might say, on the Monday, in the height of business pressure.<a name=300:1></a> I turn aside and lend myself to the Lord, and He accepts it in effect; He seeks it, and is it not so, that He is ready?<a name=300:2></a> He will always seek it from the most occupied person; the Lord will say, 'I would like your attention; I am going on with something; I am not ignoring what you are doing, but I am going on with something, the greatest possible thing; that is, the word of God'.<a name=300:3></a> The word of God is brought in where man's mind is so full, and though one's mind is so occupied and full, one is really delivered in the midst of that, from the height and the pressure of business; one is free to be with the Lord.<a name=300:4></a>

		Now that is the setting, and you all know the story of how Peter is reached here.<a name=300:5></a> Luke gives us a peculiar history of Peter, not like that given by Matthew and Mark.<a name=300:6></a> This is how he is reached, not to enlarge upon it but only to show that in this setting there were partners.<a name=300:7></a> Partners are testing to each other, and if we have partners in business, that experience ought only to qualify us to be partners in spiritual things, and that suggests that spiritual things are a partnership.<a name=300:8></a> There are two words used; the first word is that the partner is available; he could beckon to him; that is, I can call on the brethren; normally, I can call on the brethren; I can beckon.<a name=300:9></a> He beckons to his partner.<a name=300:10></a> The Lord had given him great prosperity.<a name=300:11></a> Peter did not lose anything in these matters, nor shall we ever lose anything in turning aside and saying, 'Lord, Your matters are greater than mine; You are dealing with eternal matters; I am dealing with temporal'.<a name=300:12></a> The Lord will see that you do not suffer, nor did Peter suffer.<a name=300:13></a> He had a great catch, and the partners were near.<a name=300:14></a> Would to God that we might just get this little thought of the partners!<a name=300:15></a> There are

		two words, as I said, the one is that they were each moving along, each having his own part, but that they were at the beck and call of the brethren; they were ready; they came, and this matter was suggested.<a name=301:1></a> The Lord did not help them to fill the ships; it is for you to do that.<a name=301:2></a> You say, The Lord will do it, but it is for you to do, and in matters that are needing adjustment amongst us, it is for us to settle amongst us.<a name=301:3></a> The Lord did not do anything in regard to the sinking of the ships.<a name=301:4></a> They did; they were partners.<a name=301:5></a> And then in verse 10, they shared together in astonishment, and that is what I call the real responsibility of partnership; that we shall share together in some work of God.<a name=301:6></a> They were astonished, we are told.<a name=301:7></a> It is a different word used for partners, because it means sharing good things.<a name=301:8></a> It is not like simply getting things, and having friends to help adjust matters, but to share the good things of God, as common partners, as in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>.<a name=301:9></a> It says in verses 9, 10, "He was astonished, and all that were with him .<a name=301:10></a>.<a name=301:11></a>.<a name=301:12></a> And so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon".<a name=301:13></a> You see they were partners.<a name=301:14></a> It is another word there, not simply what we had here tonight; not simply that we beckon to one another, but that we are sharing, sharing here in the things of God.<a name=301:15></a> It is for all; we share alike.<a name=301:16></a> "He was astonished, and all that were with him .<a name=301:17></a>.<a name=301:18></a>.<a name=301:19></a> also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon".<a name=301:20></a> That is the state that is brought in, the happy result of the work of God; the great miracle of the fishes, equally enjoyed.<a name=301:21></a> And what does this astonishment lead to?<a name=301:22></a> A greater appreciation of Christ, that He is the undivided Object of their attention.<a name=301:23></a> That is the idea; that we become one in contemplation of the Lord.<a name=301:24></a> And so it says, "Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men".<a name=301:25></a> That is, it is not a question of grabbing after what this great city affords; it does

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Luke brings that out: "Good will toward men", not wealth, material belongings, but men.<a name=302:3></a> "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:14">Luke  2:14</a>.<a name=302:4></a> This is what the Lord seeks, and the word of the Lord affects men; it brings the word of God into men and changes them completely about, and makes them more like a race after all.<a name=302:5></a>

		It seems appropriate that we might have a word, dear brethren, at the end of our meeting, perhaps referring to what we have had, and bearing on what is sorrowfully before us after this meeting, namely, the idea of odour, which appears in these scriptures.<a name=303:1></a> The thought of it appears early in the Scriptures, for it would seem that the bdellium mentioned as early as <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2">Genesis  2</a>alludes to a certain fragrant article or product such as a resin coming out in relation to gold and precious stones.<a name=303:2></a> We were speaking of gold and precious stones in referring to the refinement of adornment and bdellium would suggest odour which is in keeping with such refinement.<a name=303:3></a> So that in the tabernacle, we have these things: gold, as we have said, alluding to what is wrought out by God in us, and we have also the precious stones, particularly in the breastplate worn by the high priest and enclosing, by skill divinely given, the names of the saints.<a name=303:4></a> How precious they are in the divine sight!<a name=303:5></a> And then the whole scene of the tabernacle, fragrant with odour, divinely compounded, particularly as the priest dressed the lamps, that is, as discipline came in, or correction or removal of defilement, accumulated snuff; the scent was to be fragrant with the incense as the process went on.<a name=303:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And it occurred to me, dear brethren, that it is a matter to have before us, and in view of that, what a city this is, of obnoxious odours beyond description morally.<a name=303:7></a> We have to encounter these; they call forth what is in ourselves of a like kind, and work out, too, in feelings that are merely of the flesh, unwholesomely odorous.<a name=303:8></a> So that as answering in a little way to the tabernacle, there is the necessity for these typical things.<a name=303:9></a> What they mean is urgent; that is, that these

	<div class="paragraph">
		obnoxious odours should be overpowered with thoughts of Christ brought in; as the fire from the altar of God is applied the incense comes up and fills the scene; the high priest enters the holiest in a cloud, even the high priest, so that in having to say to the things of God, having to say to God in His ministry, in the sanctuary, these odours, these fragrant precious traits of Christ worked out in us, alongside the gold, are essential, or the divine nostrils are offended, so to speak.<a name=304:1></a> There is what God sees, what He hears, and what He smells, and these fragrant spices, so much touched on in Exodus, carried on from Genesis, are seen as essential to the service of God in His sanctuary; indeed, this is not a thought to be put away from us, for we are said to be God's house: "Whose house are we", a great fact, answering to the tabernacle; the true tabernacle, indeed, which the Lord has pitched, so that all the scent is to be fragrant.<a name=304:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I selected these three scriptures to show how it worked out in a typical way.<a name=304:3></a> The first one alludes to service manward.<a name=304:4></a> The apostle is saying, "But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in the Christ, and makes manifest the odour of his knowledge through us in every place", a savour of His knowledge!<a name=304:5></a> What the knowledge of God is as over against what is current, for example, knowledge that is taught in the universities and schools!<a name=304:6></a> Most of it is a knowledge falsely so-called, as Scripture says; much of it, in fact all of it, is tinged with falsity, and what an odour that is, I might say, to the spiritual nostrils!<a name=304:7></a> Whereas the apostle as coming into a town would bring fragrance of divine knowledge through the gospel.<a name=304:8></a> That is one thing, the service manward, and then, "For we are a sweet odour of Christ to God, in the saved and in those that perish; to the one an odour from death unto death, but to the others an odour from life unto life".<a name=304:9></a> That was what marked him in all his service, the fragrance that was there for any that had nostrils

		And then, applying to a weekly meeting that is now observed, namely, the meeting for prayer: we have in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#5">Revelation  5</a>that the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders "fell before the Lamb, having each a harp and golden bowls full of incenses, which are the prayers of the saints".<a name=305:3></a> It is a verse that covers peculiarly our meeting for prayer.<a name=305:4></a> It is not the prayers being prayed here, but kept in vials, golden bowls, from every possible taint or corruption like the box of spikenard.<a name=305:5></a> Spiritual prayers last; they do not evaporate, nor do they become affected by exposure, as one might say.<a name=305:6></a> Here they are kept in golden bowls, a most remarkable thing, as if these servants of God, the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures, are so intelligent in the mind of God as to this great service of prayer, that the Spirit of God would convey to us that these prayers last; they are before God.<a name=305:7></a> Is it too much to say that the prayers of Abraham have not ceased to exist?<a name=305:8></a> I think not.<a name=305:9></a> I think they last; they are before God.<a name=305:10></a> All that speaks of Christ in all His fragrance to God in this way, right from the outset down, are preserved; everything is preserved.<a name=305:11></a> Things do not evaporate spiritually, as physical things do, but here they are kept, and so we are reminded of the need of the absence of mixed motives or words in our expressions to God, that they are such as can, as it were, be preserved.<a name=305:12></a> They last.<a name=305:13></a> If they are not answered today, they may be answered one hundred years hence.<a name=305:14></a> Think of <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>being answered now.<a name=305:15></a> It lasts.<a name=305:16></a> The Lord prayed for us, not only for those that heard Him and believed on Him at that time but for all that believed on Him through them.<a name=305:17></a> The prayers are essential, kept in gold vials, full of odours, which are the prayers of the saints.<a name=305:18></a> What treasure-keepers these twenty-four elders and the four living creatures are!<a name=305:19></a> The twenty-four elders are the men of

		And then finally in chapter 8, to fulfil the righteous requirement of the law; that is another thing; that is the application, not exactly that it is to be that way, but it is actually so, "that the righteous requirement of the law should be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh but according to Spirit".<a name=335:8></a> It is not simply in newness of life, but according to Spirit; that is, we have come to see that the Spirit is here in power; so that we walk no longer in the spirit of error, or merely by rule or precept, but in new power and in a spiritual way, by the Spirit.<a name=335:9></a> We walk after the Spirit, and every righteous requirement of the law is fulfilled in us.<a name=335:10></a> It was never fulfilled in Israel in this way; it never could be, as is said in Deuteronomy.<a name=335:11></a> It is only in the power of the Spirit that it can be fulfilled.<a name=335:12></a> But it is a great triumph that God, in christians, has a real Israel of God for the moment, fulfilling the righteous requirement of the law.<a name=335:13></a> It goes further in other scriptures, but it means that what Israel should have supplied for God is now supplied in the Romans, who had had their heel on Israel after the flesh, but who have now been converted by a Jew, an instrument of

		Someone is saying under his breath, He is not preaching the gospel; but what I am saying comes in under the discriminating character of the gospel.<a name=338:3></a> It is the working out of a great scheme and, through distinction, the great sorrowful and plain fact comes out, that some are not to be saved.<a name=338:4></a> The apostle Paul says, "If also our gospel is veiled, it is veiled in those that are lost"; there is that class of people.<a name=338:5></a> What is the history of those people?<a name=338:6></a> They are people that lend themselves to the devil.<a name=338:7></a> You can easily detect who they are characteristically.<a name=338:8></a> The God of this world blinds their eyes; they are unbelieving, and as unbelieving, they are exposed to the devil and he makes use of his advantage in blinding their eyes, "so that the radiancy of the glad tidings of the glory of the Christ, who is the image of God, should not shine forth for them", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:4">2 Corinthians  4:4</a>.<a name=338:9></a> That is a terrible thought.<a name=338:10></a> I hope nobody is in the state of an unsaved person here, but the fact that there may not be one such here will not hinder me in preaching at all, because the people of God are the best listeners to the gospel.<a name=338:11></a>

		I wish to speak at this time about spirituality and I have selected Jacob as illustrative of a believer's progress in this great matter.<a name=350:1></a> I believe I have made right selection and the fact that it is said that God loved Jacob hundreds of years after he died confirms the selection.<a name=350:2></a> God is a Spirit.<a name=350:3></a> Spirituality flows out of what God is, and it is necessitated by what God is.<a name=350:4></a> First it is that which is natural, and afterwards that which is spiritual (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:46">1 Corinthians  15:46</a>).<a name=350:5></a> The spiritual is final, and corresponds with what God is.<a name=350:6></a> Unspirituality renders us unsuitable for God, untrustworthy too.<a name=350:7></a> Nothing is much more objectionable than untrustworthiness.<a name=350:8></a> So we read of certain who believed on the Lord Jesus on account of the signs which He manifested, but the Lord did not commit Himself to them; it is a very humiliating thing if the Lord has to retire because unspirituality comes into evidence in those who would make profession of Him.<a name=350:9></a> He did not commit Himself to them, it says, and immediately the Spirit of God introduces the subject of new birth as if the Spirit would say that aside from this and the development of it there can be nothing for God; He must remain alone, whereas His thought is to surround Himself with myriads in the relation of sons, that relation involving spirituality.<a name=350:10></a>

		It is a remarkable statement in the Song of Songs, "Thy teeth are like a flock of shorn sheep which go up from the washing; which have all borne twins, and none is barren among them".<a name=442:1></a> There is no suggestion of straying in this flock.<a name=442:2></a> They are going up from the washing.<a name=442:3></a> Heaven looks down upon us as moving up from the washing.<a name=442:4></a> And what are we like?<a name=442:5></a> "None is barren among them".<a name=442:6></a> We have had a wonderful time here, indeed it has been "the washing".<a name=442:7></a> Heaven is watching to see what we are like.<a name=442:8></a> As we walk down the street, or go in cars to our homes, what are we like?<a name=442:9></a> Do we love one another?<a name=442:10></a> See the loveliness of the saints as presented in this setting, as a flock of sheep; the Lord Jesus loves that.<a name=442:11></a> He loves that picture in <a href="../bible/John.htm#10">John  10</a>, His sheep.<a name=442:12></a> "I lay down my life for the sheep .<a name=442:13></a>.<a name=442:14></a>.<a name=442:15></a> .<a name=442:16></a> My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me .<a name=442:17></a>.<a name=442:18></a>.<a name=442:19></a> and they shall never perish", <a href="../bible/John.htm#10:15">John  10:15</a> - 28.<a name=442:20></a> These are beautiful things.<a name=442:21></a> The Lord Jesus will never perish and His sheep will never perish.<a name=442:22></a> "They shall never perish, and no one shall seize them out of my hand.<a name=442:23></a> My Father who has given them to me is greater than all, and no one can seize out of the hand of my Father", <a href="../bible/John.htm#10:28">John  10:28</a>, 29.<a name=442:24></a> These are precious words; they are foundational words as over against certain christians' talk of being saved today and lost tomorrow.<a name=442:25></a> "For by one offering he has perfected in perpetuity the sanctified", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:14">Hebrews  10:14</a>.<a name=442:26></a> That is the perfect sacrifice, the one offering, of Christ.<a name=442:27></a>

		These verses represent a certain group of circumstances into which Christ and the assembly enter.<a name=443:1></a> As loving Christ we are ever ready to make way for Him and His bride.<a name=443:2></a> The great lover of Christ wrote, "I speak as to Christ, and as to the assembly", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:32">Ephesians  5:32</a>.<a name=443:3></a> No doubt Paul would always wax warm and eloquent in dealing with this great theme.<a name=443:4></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is said as to John, "He who is a little one in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11:11">Matthew  11:11</a>.<a name=443:9></a> Paul was not the least in the kingdom, although he spoke of himself as "less than the least of all saints".<a name=443:10></a> That he could say that is remarkable, but heaven would say he is the greatest.<a name=443:11></a> He would, we may be sure, stimulate his hearers as speaking of Christ and the assembly.<a name=443:12></a>

		Now these verses treat of a group of circumstances, and as loving God and His truth we are ready to align ourselves with circumstances in which God would place us.<a name=443:13></a> The book of Revelation extends beyond the assembly, and it has a certain way of grouping circumstances.<a name=443:14></a> We are living in the midst of extraordinary developments, and we must group them in our minds so that we may have a clear perspective.<a name=443:15></a> We are to see how that which is of God enters into them.<a name=443:16></a> Luke has a way of grouping persons.<a name=443:17></a> It is peculiarly pleasing to see persons who

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In regard to our dear young couple here, we cannot honour them more than to fink them with Christ and the assembly, and the Lord is willing to be linked with them.<a name=444:3></a> As they are worthy, He would be the first amongst us to lay His hands on them and identify Himself with them.<a name=444:4></a> Engagements and marriages "in the Lord" are of first-rate importance in heaven, as they enter into the present testimony.<a name=444:5></a> At the present time the Spirit is stressing the household.<a name=444:6></a> The devil regards it importantly, too; he wishes to destroy the very thought of it.<a name=444:7></a> One of his chief successes is the destruction of households, whereas the Spirit of God would fortify and consolidate these holy matrimonial relations, stabilise them, and make them what God intends them to be, adjuncts to the testimony.<a name=444:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And so the Lord would lay His hands on a newly married pair as they are worthy, and of course, worthiness is historical, not theoretic.<a name=444:9></a> And no doubt those of us who know our sister would give testimony, as to her historical worthiness, and those who know our brother are ready too, if necessary, to give testimony to his historical worthiness; for the Lord has given him a place among his local brethren.<a name=444:10></a> So that we may be sure that the Lord is with us in that in which we are engaged.<a name=444:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the passage read, Christ and the assembly are linked with a set of circumstances, and it is in our minds that we may link very definitely Christ and the assembly with the circumstances we are in today, that is the union in marital bonds of our brother and sister.<a name=444:12></a> On an occasion like this we can bring forward Christ and the assembly in a peculiar way.<a name=444:13></a> It need

	<div class="paragraph">
		He graced such an occasion at Cana, but not with the same fink of feelings in which He graces an occasion that pertains to those of the assembly.<a name=445:2></a> We cannot name those who were married on that day at Cana, but we do know the pair that are here: we know them, and heaven knows them.<a name=445:3></a> If the Spirit of God were recording this occasion, He would mention their names; their names are written in heaven, and they are worthy of being recorded at such a time.<a name=445:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This meeting has in view that Christ and the assembly should have a greater place in their hearts, and in all our hearts, than hitherto.<a name=445:5></a> The Spirit would so impress them at this moment that Christ and the assembly should never be lost sight of in their hearts and in their house.<a name=445:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As you will observe, the first circumstance in the scripture before us is the destruction of the great corruptress of the earth.<a name=445:7></a> It is a great matter at such a time as this that the idea of corruption should be thoroughly judged in our hearts.<a name=445:8></a> This institution, for that is what it is, a great system viewed in a feminine way, had had the historically terrible reputation of being the corruptress of the earth.<a name=445:9></a> It is of first-rate importance that we should have in mind that all corrupting elements, especially those liable to affect the household, should be dealt with unsparingly.<a name=445:10></a> The devil is corrupting households: the youth in them are being corrupted.<a name=445:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What is celebrated here first of all is that God has judged the great harlot which corrupted the earth, and the note of praise is, "Hallelujah".<a name=445:12></a> "After these things I heard as a loud voice of a great multitude in the heaven, saying, Hallelujah".<a name=445:13></a> How refreshing this is as regards what is going on currently!<a name=445:14></a> In public means of information there is nothing about heaven, but here much people in heaven are engaged with the

		And the next thing is, what they are praising Him about.<a name=446:2></a> "True and righteous are his judgments; for he has judged the great harlot which corrupted the earth with her fornication, and has avenged the blood of his bondmen at her hand".<a name=446:3></a> As already noted, the thought of corruption has to be dealt with, and destroyed so far as we have power to do it.<a name=446:4></a> The Spirit of God enables us to do it, to destroy elements of corruption in our households.<a name=446:5></a> Here it is a celebration, and we are told that God has "avenged the blood of his bondmen at her hand".<a name=446:6></a> What blood has been shed by that awful system during many centuries!<a name=446:7></a>

		"And I heard as a voice of a great crowd, and as a voice of many waters, and as a voice of strong thunders, saying, Hallelujah, for the Lord our God the Almighty has taken to himself kingly power".<a name=446:13></a> This must be the sequel of everything: God must <i>reign</i>!<a name=446:14></a> And surely it must enter into the household now being formed: that, as it is formed, God must reign there, and our young couple would surely have in mind that He will reign in their household.<a name=446:15></a> As He reigns in a household, the saints will not fail to join in with their "Hallelujah"!<a name=446:16></a> Let us learn to use the

		I Have been thinking, dear brethren, of the use of the word 'leap' in the Scriptures, and what the Spirit had in mind in using this word.<a name=448:1></a> It is an athletic term, which is not foreign to Scripture.<a name=448:2></a> Perhaps we wonder at Scripture alluding to the arena and the racecourse, but Scripture was indited by the Holy Spirit, and the power of holiness is never affected by any detrimental element in the sphere of inspiration; indeed, the word in this respect is "To the pure all things are pure".<a name=448:3></a> And yet one would warn young minds of things that are in themselves impure-not to play with them.<a name=448:4></a> We may safely follow the Spirit of God in His use of language.<a name=448:5></a> Even the word 'dancing' has a great place in the Scriptures.<a name=448:6></a> It applies to physical ability in itself; the members of the body, the framework, are taxed by the exercise.<a name=448:7></a> God Himself, in the parable of the prodigal son, inaugurates the thought of dancing-"music and dancing".<a name=448:8></a> The psalmist alludes to it, "As well the singers as the dancers shall say, All my springs are in thee", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#87:7">Psalm  87:7</a>.<a name=448:9></a> That is in Zion-not in the arena or field, but in Zion.<a name=448:10></a> That is where we are just now, to be simple.<a name=448:11></a> All our springs are drawn from Zion, and I think it wise to begin with an example.<a name=448:12></a>
