		J.T.<a name=1:2></a> It may help us at this time to look into the features of the assembly in its <i>public</i> character, as it appeared at the beginning.<a name=1:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What comes out in Chronicles -- corresponding, I believe, with Luke -- is that there were some who came to David at Ziklag, and some who separated unto him to the stronghold in the wilderness, and a large number from each tribe are also mentioned as coming to him at Hebron; their object, in the latter case, being to transfer the kingdom from Saul to him.<a name=1:4></a> The Lord may show us in our consideration of this subject what it is to come to Himself as at Ziklag, when David kept close, as it says, because of Saul; what it is to come to Him in the stronghold in the wilderness, separated to Him; and what it is to come as to Hebron.<a name=1:5></a> You will notice that while we have only two distinct names mentioned in the latter case, namely, Jehoiada and Zadok, in the other sections a great many names and exploits are recorded.<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Luke, I think, presents the subject of gathering from the standpoint of Paul's ministry; so that it covers our own time.<a name=1:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=1:8></a> In what way do you connect Chronicles with Luke?<a name=1:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:10></a> Chronicles traces the testimony from the beginning -- from Adam.<a name=1:11></a> Luke goes back to Adam.<a name=1:12></a> He presents the public assembly in its component parts; if we take his gospel and the Acts, he presents the public body.<a name=1:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:1></a> Do you mean by the 'public body' what is seen existing outwardly now?<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:3></a> What existed at the beginning, when every member of the body was actuated, or influenced, by Christ.<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=2:5></a> As we have it in the end of Luke's gospel -- the disciples were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God.<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:7></a> Chapter 24 shows that the Lord was <i>gathering</i>.<a name=2:8></a> Two of them were straying, and that chapter shows how they were gathered; returning to Jerusalem they found the eleven and those that were with them -- the fruit of Christ's earlier work.<a name=2:9></a> And the fact that they found the eleven gathered together, and were able to take part immediately in what was proceeding, goes to show that those two were truly gathered.<a name=2:10></a> They had thought that all was lost.<a name=2:11></a> Ziklag, I think, stands for that principle.<a name=2:12></a> It had been burned with fire, and all that was of David had been carried away.<a name=2:13></a> But then Ziklag also stands for recovery.<a name=2:14></a> Where defeat had been, recovery and victory are seen.<a name=2:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:16></a> What does Hebron stand for?<a name=2:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:18></a> Colossians and Ephesians; Colossians particularly.<a name=2:19></a> There are very few who stand out distinguished there.<a name=2:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.L.<a name=2:21></a> Would Ziklag suggest Romans; and the separation to David in the stronghold in the wilderness, Corinthians; and Hebron, Colossians and Ephesians?<a name=2:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:23></a> Yes; Romans shows that where the defeat occurred victory is brought in; and in Corinthians separation is called for (the Gadites separated themselves to David in the stronghold in the wilderness); but in Hebron you may count a large number, but practically no distinguished names are mentioned -- there are only two.<a name=2:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:25></a> Why are so many names recorded at Ziklag?<a name=2:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=3>[Page 3]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:1></a> I think it is like Romans, where you have a long list of worthies at the end.<a name=3:2></a> It was a great matter that there were so many at Rome who were personally distinguished.<a name=3:3></a> The assembly at Rome was not Paul's building.<a name=3:4></a> It is a notable fact that he was there as a prisoner.<a name=3:5></a> He was not the founder of the assembly at Rome; there were very notable persons there before he arrived, who had held the ground in the midst of the greatest opposition; because, I suppose, Rome would be regarded in that light.<a name=3:6></a> So we are encouraged to individual efforts in the absence of the apostle.<a name=3:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think that all these names mentioned in the earlier part of the chapter have reference to those who are distinguished in the presence of fierce opposition; because David was still kept close on account of Saul.<a name=3:8></a> Their exploits all come out in that connection.<a name=3:9></a> At Hebron Saul is dead.<a name=3:10></a> There the power of God is evident.<a name=3:11></a> It is a question of resurrection -- the operation of God that wrought in Christ, and not a question of individual exploits.<a name=3:12></a> Two priests are named -- Jehoiada and Zadok.<a name=3:13></a> That is to say, there is prayer; that which brings in the power of God, which is now known.<a name=3:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=3:15></a> So while there may have been notable individuals present, when it comes to what was taking place at Hebron, as such they disappear.<a name=3:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:17></a> When it is a question of God's world, and the resurrection, what is priestly is in evidence; the priest brings in God's power -- he prays.<a name=3:18></a> You need that to be maintained in the new order of things.<a name=3:19></a> Hebron is looking into a new world altogether.<a name=3:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=3:21></a> God's work is carried on on the principles of death and resurrection.<a name=3:22></a> God is gathering on those principles.<a name=3:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:24></a> That is what you come to at Hebron particularly.<a name=3:25></a> But we have to begin at Ziklag, where there was public defeat.<a name=3:26></a> It is no small matter to join the Lord when things outwardly are against Him -- public

		defeat -- but then it is defeat changed into victory, and you come to the light of that; David recovered everything!<a name=4:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=4:2></a> Do you think that Ziklag suggests the kingdom side of things?<a name=4:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:4></a> Yes; as has been remarked, it corresponds with the epistle to the Romans; where defeat occurred, victory occurred.<a name=4:5></a> But Saul is still reigning.<a name=4:6></a> In the first verse of chapter 12 they go to David to Ziklag, while he kept still close because of Saul the son of Kish.<a name=4:7></a> Then, in verse 8, you have the strong-hold in the wilderness; that is to say, there is protection there.<a name=4:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=4:9></a> Our brother connected that with Corinthians.<a name=4:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:11></a> I think that is right; the assembly is treated of in 1 Corinthians.<a name=4:12></a> It runs parallel with Romans.<a name=4:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=4:14></a> Where does Matthew come in?<a name=4:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:16></a> <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18">Matthew  18</a>is the kingdom, and the assembly is brought in as a support of the kingdom; it is that to which appeal may be made.<a name=4:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=4:18></a> Why are Saul's brethren brought in?<a name=4:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:20></a> To show that those who came to David had overcome natural feelings and preferences.<a name=4:21></a> Where natural preferences are allowed to exist you cannot have the assembly.<a name=4:22></a> The Colossians were separated in their affections, and so were the Ephesians.<a name=4:23></a> In <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#12">1 Chronicles  12</a>there is a list of mighty men, and the first mentioned are the Benjamites, Saul's brethren.<a name=4:24></a> They are put at the top, I think, to show that they had overcome natural family affections.<a name=4:25></a> Later we are told most of them followed Saul; but there were those who did not, and they are specially distinguished.<a name=4:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=4:27></a> Hebron suggests Colossians; what does Ephesians suggest?<a name=4:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:29></a> Colossians is a crucial epistle, and it is a great test.<a name=4:30></a>

		purpose of God, which would be portrayed in Ephesians.<a name=5:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:2></a> David's history extends to Ephesians.<a name=5:3></a> He reigned seven years in Hebron and thirty-three in Jerusalem.<a name=5:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=5:5></a> Of course Jerusalem had to be taken.<a name=5:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:7></a> That is so, but it is really a detail; the battle was already won.<a name=5:8></a> All the tribes of Israel, it says, came to Hebron to transfer the kingdom from Saul to David.<a name=5:9></a> That is to say, at Hebron Saul is left for ever.<a name=5:10></a> He is no longer administering.<a name=5:11></a> Whilst Saul is administering, you cannot have the assembly functioning.<a name=5:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=5:13></a> You would attribute importance to the fact that those who came to David to Ziklag, while he yet kept himself close because of Saul, were armed with bows and arrows and could hurl stones with both the right hand and the left, and could handle the shield and buckler; it would suggest a greater form of offensive and defensive equipment than those who were armed with staves and spears?<a name=5:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:15></a> I think so; and when you come to Hebron, you see, they know now what is needed in the way of weapons and armour; they were ready "armed for war".<a name=5:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=5:17></a> What would answer to Saul today?<a name=5:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:19></a> The will of the flesh in persons who are in office, and are influential.<a name=5:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=5:21></a> The bows and stones would indicate that the conflict is carried on by combatants at a distance from each other.<a name=5:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:23></a> It is artillery warfare.<a name=5:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in verse 16 we have a combination of Benjamites and men of Judah; these came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the hold unto David.<a name=5:25></a> This is a remarkable combination, because one section of it would be affiliated with Saul in their <i>natural</i> feelings, and the other with David.<a name=5:26></a> So it is very

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		interesting to see that these are the only ones that David challenges.<a name=6:1></a> Persons who are in outward relation with Christ through their parents, or other natural influence, are ever liable to be unreal; moreover they are liable to be influenced by externals.<a name=6:2></a> Children of the Lord's people are already in relation with Christ; they are of His brethren, in this sense, and He challenges them, for they are likely to be unreal, governed by externals, and so untrustworthy if admitted on these grounds.<a name=6:3></a> So David challenges them, Why did they come?<a name=6:4></a> "Then the Spirit came upon Amasai, who was chief of the captains, and he said, Thine are we, David, and on thy side, thou son of Jesse: peace, peace be unto thee, and peace be to thine helpers; for thy God helpeth thee".<a name=6:5></a> (verse 18).<a name=6:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=6:7></a> Amasai first came to David, and then the Spirit came upon him.<a name=6:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:9></a> Yes; the Spirit shows Himself in the children of the Lord's people on such occasions.<a name=6:10></a> Amasai is distinguished here as the leader of this group, and the Spirit comes upon him, and he speaks to David.<a name=6:11></a> That is the answer to any doubt we might have about anybody -- the presence of the Spirit.<a name=6:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=6:13></a> I suppose anyone who can truly confess Jesus as Lord would have the Spirit.<a name=6:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:15></a> That is right.<a name=6:16></a> That is what comes out in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>, where the proof, or test, is, whether one can confess Jesus as Lord.<a name=6:17></a> It would be by the Spirit he could do it.<a name=6:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=6:19></a> It is encouraging that these people proved to be real.<a name=6:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:21></a> It is delightful!<a name=6:22></a> How pleasing it must have been to David when Amasai came forward and said, "Thine are we, David, and on thy side, thou son of Jesse: peace, peace be unto thee, and peace be to thine helpers".<a name=6:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=6:24></a> Would not that be practically confessing David as Lord?<a name=6:25></a>

		<a name=7>[Page 7]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:1></a> Yes; and you do that by the Spirit.<a name=7:2></a> It is not simply a form of speech, parrot-like.<a name=7:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=7:4></a> Not only were their hearts completely won over to David, but they also went to those who helped him.<a name=7:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:6></a> Quite so.<a name=7:7></a> They were not going to claim anything on natural lines from David; they recognised those who were there before them.<a name=7:8></a> But David was not slow to recognise what they were fit for; he made them captains of the band.<a name=7:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.J.<a name=7:10></a>B.<a name=7:11></a>C.<a name=7:12></a> And while all may not be like David's mighty men, we can all be helpers of the Lord.<a name=7:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:14></a> Quite so, they would be sons of peace, and an immense accession to the ranks of David.<a name=7:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.L.<a name=7:16></a> If we are in a spirit that is foreign to peace, we might betray Him to His enemies.<a name=7:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:18></a> Yes; I think that is pretty sure to happen if we come in under any natural influence; we shall be tested, and will give way.<a name=7:19></a> If one cannot say by the Spirit, Jesus is Lord (and of course it is for the saints to discern that it is by the Spirit), he is not qualified for the assembly.<a name=7:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then you have others coming to David.<a name=7:21></a> In verse 19 we read, "There fell some of Manasseh to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them not; for the lords of the Philistines upon deliberation sent him away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul at the peril of our heads".<a name=7:22></a> These would typify people coming into fellowship when things were not clear.<a name=7:23></a> Though David was going to battle with the Philistines, yet he had accessions.<a name=7:24></a> It shows what an attraction David was.<a name=7:25></a> Outwardly there was not much to attract, but still they came.<a name=7:26></a> One has often heard of undesirable local conditions, and yet gathering went on; showing what an attraction the Lord is.<a name=7:27></a> Where God is working all difficulties are overcome.<a name=7:28></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		Ques.<a name=8:5></a> What might we look for in a person who has the Spirit?<a name=8:6></a> How can we know?<a name=8:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:8></a> Well, you see they have confessed Jesus as Lord; and you hear how they speak to God.<a name=8:9></a> It is a wise thing to have people pray when you go to see them on such an errand.<a name=8:10></a> There may be a number of things which would indicate they had the Spirit; for example, you get a list in <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#5">Galatians  5</a>.<a name=8:11></a> You would look for these things.<a name=8:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:15></a> The Spirit would lead one to Him.<a name=8:16></a> It is for the priest to discern whether one has the Spirit.<a name=8:17></a>

		S.J.<a name=8:23></a>B.<a name=8:24></a>C.<a name=8:25></a> What you say is true; the great test is prayer.<a name=8:26></a> When a man opens his lips in prayer he usually shows his spiritual whereabouts.<a name=8:27></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:30></a> Yes; I think that <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24">Luke  24</a>shows that though the Lord had said much to the two on the road to Emmaus in the way of expounding Scripture, and their hearts burned in them as He spoke to them, the definite spiritual touch is that they recognised Him in the breaking of bread; that was what moved them, and showed that they were a spiritual element.<a name=8:31></a> And when they went back to Jerusalem it was of that they spoke, not the exposition of the Scriptures, although of course this helped them also.<a name=8:32></a> At Jerusalem they found the eleven and those with them gathered together and that brings in what I had in mind in regard to chapter 22.<a name=8:33></a> The Lord having

		received a cup at the passover, when He had given thanks said, "Take this, and divide it among yourselves" -- that cup, I apprehend, was, so to say, the essence of what God was to Israel.<a name=9:1></a> Now when those two came back to the eleven and those that were with them, they were in possession, as we may say, of the thoughts of God in the Old Testament.<a name=9:2></a> It was all there in principle; every divine thought was there, as I may say, livingly.<a name=9:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=9:4></a> And would you say then that every thought of God in connection with Israel has been handed over to the assembly?<a name=9:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=9:6></a> Well, I think that is what is meant.<a name=9:7></a> The Lord took the cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, "Take this, and divide it among yourselves".<a name=9:8></a> All that God was to Israel was brought near to them in Christ, and it was for them to enjoy it.<a name=9:9></a> The cup was there, and the Lord received it.<a name=9:10></a> It was a convenient means for Him to express all that was of God for Israel; and He gave it to them and said, "Take this, and divide it among yourselves: For I say unto you, that I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come".<a name=9:11></a> It was passed on to them.<a name=9:12></a>

		S.J.<a name=9:13></a>B.<a name=9:14></a>C.<a name=9:15></a> In Matthew and Mark He does not say of the passover cup, Take this and divide it among yourselves.<a name=9:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=28:1></a> In undertaking to consider this book, the thought was that we might see how a man according to God is developed; and then, when difficulties arise, to see how man according to man is developed.<a name=28:2></a> The first is seen in Samuel; the second in Saul.<a name=28:3></a> Our inquiry this morning led us to the beginning of chapter 4, where Samuel is seen as matured, and recognised from Dan to Beersheba.<a name=28:4></a> Chapter 1 shows the conditions obtaining in Israel which led to this development that we see in Samuel.<a name=28:5></a> It was pointed out that God always begins with what is mature, or full grown.<a name=28:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		J.T.<a name=28:9></a> That is what appears here.<a name=28:10></a> It says in <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#3:19">1 Samuel  3:19</a>, "Samuel grew, and Jehovah was with him, and let none of his words fall to the ground".<a name=28:11></a> We have no more reference to his growth, so that evidently he had reached maturity there.<a name=28:12></a> Already he was in possession of the mind of God in regard to Eli, and Eli's house; and now the Lord is with him, and lets none of his words fall to the ground.<a name=28:13></a> His service is beginning, and God is helping him so that he should acquire recognition amongst those whom he served; hence it says, "All Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, knew that Samuel was established a prophet of Jehovah" (verse 20).<a name=28:14></a>

		J.T.<a name=31:2></a> Well, you see in chapter 5 the history of the overthrow of Dagon, and the governmental act of God in smiting the Philistines with hemorrhoids.<a name=31:3></a> The god of this world was dealt with by the testimony, but the persons who were supporting idolatry are attacked governmentally.<a name=31:4></a> These are extended thoughts, but they are necessary for every one who serves, and indeed every Christian, to have before him, that he may know how God deals with the darkness of this world to make a way for the testimony.<a name=31:5></a> How far-reaching and how powerful His way is!<a name=31:6></a> And yet here there is neither Levite, priest, nor prophet in evidence.<a name=31:7></a> It is God dealing with the situation Himself, God and the ark, and then in the governmental act, the hemorrhoids attacked everybody.<a name=31:8></a> He is dealing with men severally in relation to His testimony; and this leads to a serious taking into account of things.<a name=31:9></a> The ark is sent from city to city, from place to place, only to bring out this governmental act of God.<a name=31:10></a> "And it came to pass, when the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to kill us and our people.<a name=31:11></a> And they sent and gathered all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark .<a name=31:12></a>.<a name=31:13></a>.<a name=31:14></a> For there was deadly alarm throughout the city: the hand of God was very heavy there; and the men that died not were smitten with the hemorrhoids; and the cry of the city went up to heaven" (<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#5:10">1 Samuel  5:10</a> - 12).<a name=31:15></a>

		I am impressed at this time with the grace of the present dispensation; the grace in which God, through the Lord Jesus Christ, presents the testimony in this our era; and it is my desire that you all may be impressed with it.<a name=43:1></a> Luke is specially intended to convey this grace to us.<a name=43:2></a> It is he who tells us (quoting the Lord), that the glad tidings should be preached to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem; and in that statement is wrapt up the grace to which I have alluded.<a name=43:3></a> Further, he tells us that the apostles who should present the gospel, were to tarry in the city of Jerusalem until they would be clothed with power from on high.<a name=43:4></a> I need not say they were equal to the clothing that would descend upon them; they were not babes; heaven knew their measure; and as having grown up under the influence and culture of the Lord, they were equal in their constitution and growth to the heavenly clothing.<a name=43:5></a>

		You will remember how the mantle of Elijah fell from him as he ascended into heaven; and Elisha, the vessel through whom the testimony was to be set forth, took it up, and, rending his own garment, appropriated it.<a name=43:6></a> He had been under Elijah's tutorship, and he recognised that the clothes which he had worn while at school would not be suitable when he faced the sphere of his testimony here; so he takes up Elijah's mantle, and appropriates it.<a name=43:7></a> The disciples had been, so to speak, at school.<a name=43:8></a> I think it is well for young people to consider this matter.<a name=43:9></a> Young Levites were permitted to enter upon a sort of apprenticeship at the age of twenty-five years, but they were not to take up their levitical work strictly

		So, correspondingly, His disciples whom He had taught were to tarry in the city of Jerusalem until clothed with power from on high.<a name=44:3></a> They were not morally inferior to the clothes.<a name=44:4></a> You will remember, when Peter stood up, how beautifully they sat upon him.<a name=44:5></a> On the day of Pentecost the Holy Spirit came down in the form of cloven tongues as of fire, and sat upon each of them.<a name=44:6></a> Each one would therefore be conscious of what had come down.<a name=44:7></a> And if the Holy Spirit sat on each there would be that deliberation, that restfulness, which is befitting levitical work.<a name=44:8></a> Peter stands up with the eleven, and in his heavenly clothing he presents the glad tidings.<a name=44:9></a> It is the only clothing becoming to a servant of Christ.<a name=44:10></a> We may see around us people wearing religious habiliments, but they are not in keeping with the heavenly garments.<a name=44:11></a> Heavenly garments alone befit the message that is to be presented.<a name=44:12></a> And so, reverting to our Lord as having received the Holy Spirit, Luke tells us that He descended in a bodily form upon Him pointing to the fact that the Spirit did not come in part, but in entirety.<a name=44:13></a> Think of the grace and power wrapt up in the presence of the Holy Spirit in that bodily way!<a name=44:14></a>

		So John brings out that there is a Man who <i>knows;</i> and if you are exercised and make inquiry, make sure you find that Man.<a name=101:13></a> The apostle Paul brought this forward when writing to the Ephesians; he says, "ye can understand my intelligence in the mystery;" and the whole of the epistle to the Colossians is to guard the saints from man's teaching -- philosophy and vain deceit.<a name=101:14></a>

		I want to go on to the epistle of John, to show you how the young believer has, in principle, by the possession of the Spirit, a means of being independent of man.<a name=101:15></a> He says, "Ye have an unction".<a name=101:16></a> He is

		speaking to "little children;" and I desire to be as simple and as pointed as the beloved apostle, for he certainly did not aim over anybody's head; he included the little ones in his epistle.<a name=102:1></a> He addresses believers in their varied stages of growth, and in this section he addresses the "little children".<a name=102:2></a> He says to them, "Ye have the unction from the holy one, and ye know all things" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:20">1 John  2:20</a>).<a name=102:3></a> That refers to the believer as having the Spirit, the unction referring to the Spirit; it dignifies the believer.<a name=102:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I see a christian recently converted, and he is reading the Bible, and I see him turning to God as he reads, and discarding the pernicious books that he read before he was converted.<a name=102:5></a> I see him, like the Ephesians when they were converted, burning the books, although they were costly, and I say, Although that young christian thinks very little of himself, in the eyes of heaven he is dignified.<a name=102:6></a> It is in a very little thing that you show you are taking on the heavenly dignity; for the olive tree (which is a type of the Spirit) in refusing to rule over the trees would not leave his function, for by him God was honoured and man was honoured.<a name=102:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If I accept the Bible and reject man's productions, I am honouring God.<a name=102:8></a> What leads me to do that?<a name=102:9></a> the Spirit.<a name=102:10></a> The very instincts of the Spirit lead me to reject what is of man and to accept what is of God.<a name=102:11></a> Nicodemus had those instincts, although not yet having the Spirit; he says, "We know that thou art come a teacher from God" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:2">John  3:2</a>).<a name=102:12></a> He did not know very much, but that was of paramount importance and he was dignified to that extent.<a name=102:13></a> He traced the miracles to their source, attributing them to God; and the One through whom they came had Himself come from God.<a name=102:14></a> So Nicodemus is on the line of learning, when he says, "we know that thou art come a teacher from God".<a name=102:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, the apostle says to the little ones, "Ye have

	<div class="paragraph">
		the unction from the holy one, and ye know all things".<a name=103:1></a> That is what I might call potential.<a name=103:2></a> Although the young believer does not know things in detail, he does in principle, he has got the means of knowing them; whereas the most learned man, if unconverted, has not.<a name=103:3></a> The youngest believer has the unction from the Holy One to know all things.<a name=103:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle says further, "the unction which ye have received" (verse 27).<a name=103:5></a> That word "received" means that there has been an action by the believer.<a name=103:6></a> The gift of the Spirit is from the divine side, but the reception is from my side.<a name=103:7></a> I have committed myself; so He says that "the unction which ye have received from him abides in you".<a name=103:8></a> You may rely upon it, the Holy Spirit will not leave you; He is here to teach you.<a name=103:9></a> You are precious in the eyes of heaven, and the Holy Spirit has taken charge of you, and He will work to preclude all that is of man, "Ye have not need that any one should teach you" -- that is not a man like the apostle John -- all the gifts are men.<a name=103:10></a> What is referred to is the man that the Lord knew, and refused to trust, a man that is not born again, and one who has not got the Spirit; you do not need him.<a name=103:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus the believer is set up in the understanding of the Spirit in independency; he is dignified by the anointing.<a name=103:12></a> But one's dignity is sustained so that one is in dependence.<a name=103:13></a> The word 'independent' is a good one for christians, but if you apply it in your relations with God, or with your brethren, it expresses what is bad.<a name=103:14></a> But it is a very important word as expressive of what we have in the Holy Spirit, so that I am independent of the men of this world to teach me I do not need them.<a name=103:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to show you from the book of Samuel how God brings forward the elements of help.<a name=103:16></a> In Christ you have a Man that knows; being ascended on high as a Man, He has received gifts in relation to men, and He has given them here, so that these things

		may be known; it says, "with a view to the work of the ministry, with a view to the edifying of the body of Christ; until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at the full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:12">Ephesians  4:12</a>, 13).<a name=104:1></a> So there is that here which corresponds with Christ above; things are known, and what is known thus is available to every believer.<a name=104:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have in Samuel the things whereby we are helped on this line of acquiring spiritual understanding and spiritual fitness for the representation of God.<a name=104:3></a> I do not dwell on the poor man who is alluded to here -- Saul; he was a man after the flesh, and what applies to the man after the flesh applies to him.<a name=104:4></a> I refer to this chapter as setting forth what is available to the believer; what was available to Saul is available to every believer.<a name=104:5></a> These things were not recorded as mere history; they are available to us.<a name=104:6></a> So what we see is, Saul was anointed, and kissed -- a very beautiful touch; a touch, indeed, which every young believer should experience.<a name=104:7></a> Then he was to have a position in relation to the inheritance of the Lord; he was to be captain of the inheritance.<a name=104:8></a> Think of being introduced to this!<a name=104:9></a> Think of having part in the inheritance!<a name=104:10></a> whatever your part may be in it.<a name=104:11></a> The apostle prayed for the Ephesians, that they might know what is "the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:18">Ephesians  1:18</a>).<a name=104:12></a> Think of having part in that!<a name=104:13></a> Saul is anointed and kissed, and then he departs.<a name=104:14></a> He is on his own responsibility now.<a name=104:15></a> A believer has to learn to walk; he has to start out on his own account, but fully furnished.<a name=104:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But then you are a <i>son</i> too!<a name=105:13></a> Benjamin was the son of his father's right hand.<a name=105:14></a> Saul, too, had a father and the father was sorrowing: "What shall I do for my son?<a name=105:15></a>" You are impressed at the outset that the Father is interested in you.<a name=105:16></a> It is a great comfort and a great source of strength to the young believer to know that God is interested in him as a son.<a name=105:17></a> Then the causes of any anxiety you may have will surely be removed for you: "The asses are found".<a name=105:18></a>

		J.T.<a name=122:1></a> The subject before us is to touch a little on the recovery of <i>brethren;</i> and, as has been previously remarked in regard to Enoch, Noah, and Jacob, I believe we shall see that in the recovery of Joseph's brethren there was what was for God's pleasure.<a name=122:2></a> What comes out in the last book of the Old Testament, is that God loved Jacob and hated Esau.<a name=122:3></a> Now Esau was Jacob's brother, and notwithstanding the fact that he had been shown great consideration throughout his history, he never manifested the spirit of a brother towards Jacob.<a name=122:4></a> We have also in Cain a brother who, although standing in that relationship with Abel, was a murderer; indeed, Esau was little better, for he maintained an implacable hatred of Jacob, in whose family the spirit of a brother was developed.<a name=122:5></a> So that the book of Malachi is very solemn, coming in at the end, and pointing out one who, in the relation of a brother, failed in the spirit and affection that belong to it, and came in for divine disapproval; the word in regard to him is, "I hated Esau" (<a href="../bible/Malachi.htm#1:3">Malachi  1:3</a>).<a name=122:6></a> That is in view of his history, the history having been completed.<a name=122:7></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=178:3></a> Our subject in all four meetings is one, that is, it embraces the features of christianity that are spoken of as <i>new</i> under four distinct heads: the new cruse, which we considered yesterday morning; the new bottles, which we considered yesterday afternoon; the new man, which we propose to consider on this occasion; and then the new Jerusalem, which it is thought should be considered this afternoon.<a name=178:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At our first reading we dealt with the new cruse, reading from <a href="../bible/2Kings.htm#2">2 Kings  2</a>, part of <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>, and the closing verses of Mark 9, to bring out a little the preservative element in what was left here by the Lord as formed by Him.<a name=178:5></a> The vessel, or cruse, it was thought, was seen in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>, and the new features were noted.<a name=178:6></a> Then the salt put into it was particularly enlarged on in a practical way, as showing how divine things are preserved in freshness amongst the people of God.<a name=178:7></a> Then, in the afternoon, the closing verses of <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#5">Luke  5</a>were read, which speak of the parable of the new cloth and the old garment, the new wine and the new bottles, in conjunction with the opening and closing verses of <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>, to point out the strength of the vessels into which the Spirit came; how the assembly at the beginning was great enough, or rather those who formed the assembly, were great enough to receive the Spirit.<a name=178:8></a> There was no evidence of any incongruity in the away they behaved.<a name=178:9></a> With the presence of the Holy Spirit in them they were equal to the further increase, as it were, from heaven through the apostles' ministry -- the vessels were great

		enough for it -- and great enough also for the influx of converts through the gospel.<a name=179:1></a> So in that way it was a question in the bottles rather of moral greatness and strength.<a name=179:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.J.<a name=179:3></a>McB.<a name=179:4></a> The general impression in my own mind in the morning, was that we reached the thought of what was preservative, and the feeling in relation to peace among ourselves; and in the afternoon we saw the importance of there being a vessel here that would answer to any outpouring that God might give in relation to it, so that whether it was a question of increase of spiritual capacity it would stand it, or an increase of numbers in the saints it would stand that too.<a name=179:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=179:6></a> Our subject on this occasion, as has been remarked, is the new man, which obviously presents a different line of thought, and I think what may be borne in mind to begin with is that the new man is what is for God in the midst of what is old and corrupt; first, as in Colossians in the way of freshness in the energy of life, and then secondly in Ephesians, as a creation, a positive creation marked by what stands in the midst of the corruption, and holds for God in that freshness.<a name=179:7></a> It is "created in truthful righteousness and holiness", and the renewing in the spirit of the mind involves that that is maintained in freshness.<a name=179:8></a> The word, "being renewed", would indicate that what is created does not grow old; it remains fresh.<a name=179:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=180:8></a> Kept fresh.<a name=180:9></a> The "being renewed in the spirit of your mind" is the youthful thought in Ephesians, whereas in Colossians "renewed into full knowledge" is the thought of a different kind of knowledge.<a name=180:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=180:14></a> That is what I thought.<a name=180:15></a> There the word 'new' means it is different, whereas the renewal of the spirit of the mind is, it is kept youthful.<a name=180:16></a> There are two words used in the original in Colossians, the new man is youthful and the knowledge is different; "renewed" there is not the idea of youthfulness, because it is to the image of Him who created him.<a name=180:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=204:13></a> I think so.<a name=204:14></a> You can discern that in your own experience; whilst in a general way those with whom you walk are going on with God, yet you yourself have to overcome.<a name=204:15></a> In fact, it is in your overcoming and in the overcoming of others that the thing is maintained.<a name=204:16></a> The idea of overcoming relates to what is evil and opposed in a <i>general</i> way, not simply to the state of any given church.<a name=204:17></a>

		The need of overcoming is present always, and one qualifies as in Philadelphia for a position in the temple.<a name=205:1></a> The temple is that in which the mind of God is preserved, and this is the first thing mentioned, "him will I make a pillar in the temple of my God", showing that an overcomer is concerned primarily about what the mind of God is, and the thoughts of God being preserved and maintained here.<a name=205:2></a> That is the first idea you get, and the next is "the name of my God", which includes <i>revelation</i>.<a name=205:3></a> I apprehend an overcomer now holds to the complete revelation of God.<a name=205:4></a> He sees that the world as an organisation is set against that.<a name=205:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Organised opposition is the most powerful opposition there is, and the book of Revelation shows that there is that character of opposition in the world to the love of God flowing out.<a name=205:6></a> Then there is the great city Babylon, the most powerful of all organisations against God, against the revelation of God.<a name=205:7></a> Well, the overcomer in Philadelphia stands against all that, so that he has the name of His God written upon him, and then the name of the city of His God.<a name=205:8></a> He holds to divine administration, and that it must be complete, as the heavenly city suggests.<a name=205:9></a> In other words, the overcomer stands for everything that has come out in the dispensation.<a name=205:10></a> He stands over against Sardis, whose works are incomplete.<a name=205:11></a> The overcomer in Philadelphia goes on to completeness.<a name=205:12></a> He will have that feature, and I think that is what the city would suggest -- "the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven, from my God".<a name=205:13></a> Then he understands the Lord's new name.<a name=205:14></a> He sees the Lord, I apprehend, operating, but all that has come out in Him is in relation to what is new.<a name=205:15></a>

		I wish to speak on this occasion about divine love and particularly to point out what hinders its outflow and activities.<a name=223:1></a> I read the passages in Revelation in order to show you what hinders the outflow of divine love, first in its bearing towards the world, and, secondly, in its bearing towards the assembly.<a name=223:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		John points out, or asserts by the Spirit, in the passage read in his gospel, the bearing of the love of God towards the world; and in his first epistle he asserts its bearing towards the saints.<a name=223:3></a> In each connection he speaks of the Lord Jesus as the only-begotten Son of God.<a name=223:4></a> In the epistle he says: "Herein as to us has been manifested the love of God, that God has sent his only-begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:9">1 John  4:9</a>).<a name=223:5></a> Thus he formally distinguishes between the love of God in its bearing towards the world and in its bearing towards the saints, and I hope to show from the passages read in Revelation what hinders its outflow towards the world, and what hinders its outflow towards the saints, so that we may be able to determine severally whether these hindrances have any place with us, and if so, that we may, as discerning them, judge them and abandon them, for we cannot, beloved, afford to be without the present outflow and service of divine love.<a name=223:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in speaking of this, I am quite conscious that I am speaking of perhaps the greatest thing; indeed, I am speaking, or hope to speak, about God Himself -- an undertaking of which one is conscious, for there is a sense of one's meagreness and littleness in regard

		of God.<a name=224:1></a> But notwithstanding that one is conscious of one's smallness, one is also conscious of God's greatness, and His greatness is seen in measure in His ability to use what is small; for we are in a day of small things and, one may say, in a day of small vessels.<a name=224:2></a> One is therefore encouraged to approach such a great theme, and in approaching it I would refer for a moment to the revelation of God, or, as the more correct word is in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>, the declaration of God.<a name=224:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What you will observe in this passage, which is so brief and yet so full, is that there are two different tenses employed by the Spirit: "the only-begotten Son, who <i>is</i> in the bosom of the Father, <i>he hath</i> declared him" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:18">John  1:18</a>).<a name=224:4></a> The declaration is viewed as in the past.<a name=224:5></a> The mind is directed to the records of the gospels.<a name=224:6></a> This gospel was written long after the death, and resurrection, and ascension of our Lord Jesus Christ into heaven, and the writer directs our minds to the present position of the only-begotten Son as being, in the bosom of the Father; as it says, "who is in the bosom of the Father".<a name=224:7></a> Our minds are therefore directed to the source of love, and to the channel of love -- the holy, divine channel of love, and in using that expression as I do with reverence and holy regard for the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ, I would suggest to you the importance of understanding His mediatorial position.<a name=224:8></a> Everything emanates from God, "for of him, and through him, and for him are all things" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11:36">Romans  11:36</a>).<a name=224:9></a> Everything that emanates from Him must return in its results to Him, and in between lies the great mediatorial position and service of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=224:10></a> Unless we lay hold of that we shall be beclouded in regard of many portions of scripture, and the wonderful passage which I have cited, "the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father", is a mediatorial reference.<a name=224:11></a> You may say, it is a family reference.<a name=224:12></a> Be it so,

		The Son is where the love is, and being there, He is competent to make it known, and to give it freshness of application; and the Holy Spirit is here corresponding to that.<a name=225:8></a> The position is marvellous -- the present position -- the Son seen mediatorially as the only-begotten Son where love is.<a name=225:9></a> It is all in His hand, and in order to make the thing effective He is seen as the Spirit of the covenant -- not as the Son, but as the Lord: "Now the Lord is the Spirit" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#3:17">2 Corinthians  3:17</a>).<a name=225:10></a> He is pleased to assert His divinely given authority to make the love effective, for what is before God, is not only that His love should be commended, but that His love should be effective and, as regards ourselves, that it should be in our hearts.<a name=225:11></a> The Son is in the place of the love -- the bosom of the Father -- but He asserts His authority so as to enforce it, and as we know what He is doing, we are perfectly restful in according to Him full rights as the Spirit of the covenant.<a name=225:12></a> "The Lord is the Spirit", it says, "but where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty".<a name=225:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think it advisable that attention should be called to this, because at the present time we are faced with this organised opposition to God.<a name=227:6></a> I do not charge all those who are in it with knowledge of it, or intent, nevertheless the thing is there.<a name=227:7></a> I am not for the moment speaking of religious organisation (I hope to speak of that later), but of organisation among men.<a name=227:8></a> John says that men loved darkness rather than light -- a terrible indictment against our race!<a name=227:9></a> Much is made of man as a race at the present time; there is much effort to exalt him, but here is the solemn statement of Scripture -- of God -- that men loved darkness rather than light, and hence, in order to effectively shut out the light, they have resorted to organisation.<a name=227:10></a> You will find in the gospel of Matthew opposition to God in pairs of men; for instance, in the two possessed with devils; <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#8:28">Matthew  8:28</a>.<a name=227:11></a> The revelation of God in the gospel is met by organised opposition.<a name=227:12></a>

		And so, in closing, may I make appeal to the young people here, "Be not diversely yoked with unbelievers".<a name=233:3></a> That is what marks many, I fear, consequently there is a narrowing up, a straitening, so that the ministry of the love of Christ is not circulating in your hearts.<a name=233:4></a> Hence the apostle says, "Be not diversely yoked with unbelievers".<a name=233:5></a> And lest there should be any doubt as to what he means, he speaks of righteousness and lawlessness; these two are diverse and must never be put together.<a name=233:6></a> Then he says, there are light and darkness -- and what fellowship has the one with the other?<a name=233:7></a> There are Christ and Beliar -- you cannot put these two together.<a name=233:8></a> The passage leaves no doubt at all as to what is meant.<a name=233:9></a> There is the believer and the unbeliever.<a name=233:10></a> Am I associating with an unbeliever?<a name=233:11></a> He may not be an open idolater or blasphemer, but is he an unbeliever?<a name=233:12></a> Then there is the temple of God of which I have spoken; if we have any knowledge of access to God, we know what that means; it is over against idols.<a name=233:13></a> The Lord leaves no doubt as to what He means.<a name=233:14></a> And it goes on to say, "<i>Ye</i> are the living God's temple".<a name=233:15></a> What a marvellous word!<a name=233:16></a> Then he says, "I will dwell among them, and walk among them; and I will be their God, and they shall be to me a people".<a name=233:17></a> You see what God proposes; He would not only dwell among us, He would walk among us -- would move about amongst us in His love.<a name=233:18></a> He loves us when together; He loves us in our homes; He loves us in our businesses; He would make His love known to us in every relation.<a name=233:19></a> But He shows there must be the avoidance of the unequal yoke.<a name=233:20></a> Then is added, "Wherefore come out from the midst of them, and be separated .<a name=233:21></a>.<a name=233:22></a>.<a name=233:23></a> and I will receive you; and I will be to you for a Father, and ye shall be to me for sons and

		It is laid on my mind, dear friends, on this occasion, to speak of fruitfulness.<a name=247:1></a> The idea, as you will all be aware appears early in Scripture; it appears on the third day of what we call the creation.<a name=247:2></a> There can be no doubt that the submerged condition of the earth occasioned its fruitfulness -- layer upon layer being laid on into which God in time would give the impulse of life, so that the earth, as the Lord says in the gospels, should bear fruit of itself.<a name=247:3></a> There was the latent power of fruitfulness there, placed there divinely; it was placed there of God.<a name=247:4></a> It was not simply the outcome of natural causes, as men speak, for the actual life or fruitfulness that issues therefrom is directly from God.<a name=247:5></a> The creation was not some-thing let go from the divine hand to operate itself -- such is not the divine way.<a name=247:6></a> God ever holds His hand over, and under, and about what He creates, so that as we read of a bare grain sown, "it may be of wheat, or some one of the rest: and God gives to it a body as he has pleased" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:37">1 Corinthians  15:37</a>, 38.<a name=247:7></a>

		The third day in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>was marked by the earth emerging from its submerged condition -- the dry land appeared; it came out fertile, it came out with latent life from God, so that it was to bring forth, as God said, "Let the earth cause grass to spring up, herb producing seed, fruit-trees yielding fruit after their kind, the seed of which is in them" <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:11">Genesis  1:11</a>.<a name=247:8></a> The botanist may trace it to what he calls nature, or natural development or evolution; but Scripture connects it with God; as I remarked, the grain is placed in the earth, the power of life is in the earth, but <i>God</i> gives it a body.<a name=247:9></a> We see, therefore, that God is behind everything -- even the

		J.T.<a name=261:5></a> Yes.<a name=261:6></a> I think the truth stands in Leviticus thus: God is in the tabernacle and He speaks out of it, that is the position; then He invites the people to draw near according to their measure.<a name=261:7></a> It is the worshipper -- the man himself -- who draws near; he comes with an offering, a burnt-offering, a meat-offering, a peace-offering, a sin-offering, or a trespass-offering; it is his doing, and according to his own measure.<a name=261:8></a> These chapters therefore bring out the moral qualities of the saints, as built up for the divine pleasure; the worshippers show, by their voluntary action Godward, the measure in which they correspond with Christ, and how far they see what He was, as represented in these various offerings, in going into death.<a name=261:9></a> Their appreciation of Christ is measured by their offerings on whatever line they may approach.<a name=261:10></a> Then the law governing all these offerings was given to the <i>priests</i>, so that the standard might be maintained amongst the people of God.<a name=261:11></a> In chapter 8 God reverts to His own thought; so the high priest is anointed apart from death, and the tabernacle is anointed with him, setting forth the position of Christ as the inaugurator and maintainer of the divine system.<a name=261:12></a> Christ was anointed in manhood apart from any thought of death; the Spirit came down and identified Himself with Him at the outset of His service here for God.<a name=261:13></a> His death comes in on <i>our</i> account, so when we have learned the epistles, and they have had their place with us, we go back to the gospels to see the divine thought set forth perfectly in Christ -- it is seen in absolute perfection in Him -- His personal dignity and immunity from death.<a name=261:14></a> Then the saints -- typified in Aaron's sons -- are brought in through death in connection with Him.<a name=261:15></a>

		J.T.<a name=277:2></a> That is what I thought.<a name=277:3></a> If the service of God be taken up apart from the family relationship, we shall have a hard legal system, more or less perhaps governed by the word of God, but without the substance, without the affections underlying it, that suggest what God is.<a name=277:4></a> Christendom, I think, presents that -- a service, ostensibly the service of God -- without any idea of the family: men are not developed to be ministers apart from the family relationship.<a name=277:5></a> In Exodus we find that the great family development of Genesis is carried over under the paternal care of Joseph; he cherishes in a paternal way the thought of the family.<a name=277:6></a> So Exodus opens with the attempt of the enemy, seeing evidently what God had in His mind, to destroy that family in the males; but they were kept alive in the sovereignty of God.<a name=277:7></a> In <a href="../bible/chapter.htm#6">chapter  6</a>the Spirit of God chronicles the family of Jacob as far as Levi; they are all given earlier (<a href="../bible/chapter.htm#1">chapter  1</a>), but the Holy Spirit returns to the family in chapter 6 and gives us the list until we come to Levi, then He stops there because, as is evident, He has in mind the ministerial side of priesthood, which is developed from the house of Levi; the ministers, the priests spring from the house of Levi.<a name=277:8></a> The family thought, therefore, ends up with Levi -- with the priests in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#6">Exodus  6</a>, so the passage closes with, "This is that Moses and Aaron" (verse 27), and you get no more, for that is what God has in His mind in these books.<a name=277:9></a> God had previously said to Moses, "this shall be the sign to thee that I have sent thee: when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#3:12">Exodus  3:12</a>) -- -that is, at Horeb; it was there that the service of God was opened up and developed, and where He established the priesthood.<a name=277:10></a> But you will observe that before the thought of priesthood is developed, the Spirit of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I conceive that in this first letter to the Corinthians the apostle had in mind that there should be in Corinth a vessel in which God would set out His service, in which He would set forth His testimony; indeed, I believe, the creation as we know it -- the physical creation -- was intended for this very purpose.<a name=295:3></a> It was to be a sphere in which God would make Himself known.<a name=295:4></a> I suppose also that the angelic creation or order was intended for the same thing, as a vehicle through which God could display Himself.<a name=295:5></a> Very little indeed is revealed to us as to the angelic hosts, but enough to show that it was a creation marked by order -- divine order, and that the idea of rank entered into it; we read of Michael the archangel.<a name=295:6></a> There can be no doubt that the Spirit of God in Ezekiel alludes to that order, when He speaks of the king of Tyre as "the anointed covering cherub" (<a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#28:14">Ezekiel  28:14</a>).<a name=295:7></a> He is presented as one distinguished in rank and in service, for he is spoken of as "the anointed covering cherub".<a name=295:8></a>

		Then again, he was adorned with every precious stone, for the idea of adornment necessarily enters into all that which God would use as a means by which to display Himself.<a name=295:9></a> A list of nine precious stones which appear in his covering is enumerated, but the number was short of the divine thought, it

		Now when we come down to Moses and Aaron we have a pattern shown on the mount -- the mount of God -- as to that in which He would display Himself, that in which He would be served, that in which He would set forth His testimony.<a name=297:10></a> I connect all that with 1 Corinthians, and I hope to be able to make it clear so that all may follow, because the divine thread runs right through.<a name=297:11></a> Corinthians contemplates the tabernacle in the wilderness, that is to say, it contemplates an order -- a system of things set up here in the presence of evil, and in spite of evil, in which God is to be served, in which His testimony is to be set out, and in which His testimony is to be enhanced, so that an unbeliever coming in is so impressed with the presence of God, and by His glory, that he falls down upon his face declaring, "God is indeed amongst you".<a name=297:12></a> Wonderful conception!<a name=297:13></a> There is that, as I said, set up in the presence of the evil, and in spite of the evil, in which God will set forth His glory -- that

		So the epistle to Corinthians is intended to build up step by step, inch by inch, as I may say, the material of this structure, so that each part will be in its place in the divine organisation; "that there be no divisions among you", that there should be an organism "fitted together;" as he says, "so also is the Christ.<a name=298:3></a> For also in the power of one Spirit we have all been baptised into one body, .<a name=298:4></a>.<a name=298:5></a>.<a name=298:6></a> and have all been given to drink of one Spirit" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:12">1 Corinthians  12:12</a>, 13).<a name=298:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The vessel is there; now such is the divine thought.<a name=298:8></a> When the apostle says "so also is the Christ" the allusion is to the saints, that is, to the assembly, as set up, bit by bit, part by part, and anointed by the Spirit in a public way and designated as "the Christ" -- a vessel in which God would act and display His glory, in which He would present His service and His testimony in such wise that an unbeliever entering into that company would fall down as convicted of God, and acknowledge that God was there.<a name=298:9></a> It is not only that the light was there, not only that the Spirit was there, but that <i>God</i> was there.<a name=298:10></a> The Spirit <i>is</i>  God, to be sure, but God Himself was there and there to be blessing to men.<a name=298:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that will shows itself in the order of first, secondly, thirdly.<a name=300:3></a> It is no question of accident here, it is a question of the will of God; "<i>God</i> has <i>set</i> certain in the assembly" -- <i>He</i> has set them there for His will.<a name=300:4></a> In Ephesians it is a question of gift; Christ has gone far above all heavens as Man and He has received gifts as Man for men, and He gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists and some shepherds and teachers -- it is a question of endowment.<a name=300:5></a> The church was wonderfully endowed by Christ; there it is a question of gift.<a name=300:6></a> But in Corinthians it is not exactly gift that is prominent, but the will of God.<a name=300:7></a> It is not that He <i>gave</i> the assembly apostles and prophets, but He <i>set</i> them there: just as He set the stars in the firmament of the heavens, so He has set certain in the assembly, as it has pleased Him -- according to His sovereign choice.<a name=300:8></a> I do not suppose that there is anything that man quarrels with more than the sovereignty of God, and yet the sovereignty of God provides for the love of God, for His love is sovereign, so in quarrelling with the sovereignty of God we quarrel with His love.<a name=300:9></a>

		It provides, too, for the power of God, and the wisdom of God, so if we find fault with His sovereignty, we find fault with His power and with His wisdom.<a name=300:10></a> So in accordance with His sovereign will He has set certain in the assembly.<a name=300:11></a>

		There is no such thought in Scripture as gifts being set in localities; bishops and elders are set in localities, but gifts are for the assembly -- the whole church of God.<a name=300:12></a> If there are too many gifts in a locality, the question is raised at once whether the will of God is allowed its full course, its full sway.<a name=300:13></a>

		Well, gifts, as I said, are set in the assembly, for the good of the assembly; where they may be geographically is another matter.<a name=301:12></a> My geographical position is a question of the government of God; the government of God is concurrent with the service of God, and it is intended to support the service of God, but one's gift is not a question of the government of God, but of His will.<a name=301:13></a> One is set definitely in the assembly and one's position is fixed by the sovereign will of God, and each one should know it.<a name=301:14></a> God intends that it should be known; He intends that each gift should be known, and that its position should be known, so it is set in the assembly, not in any locality; its domain of service is the assembly.<a name=301:15></a> But then I want to show that the order is one, two, three; "first, apostles; secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers".<a name=301:16></a> According to this passage, the evangelist

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Anyone who is to be the first in the service of God must be prepared for the severest discipline.<a name=302:11></a> Paul says, "I think that God has set us the apostles for the last, as appointed to death" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#4:9">1 Corinthians  4:9</a>.<a name=302:12></a> He has set them that way, "first apostles".<a name=302:13></a> And why?<a name=302:14></a> Because they were first in suffering; they were the first morally, but they were the last outwardly in the sense of reproach and in the sense of suffering -- they were appointed to death.<a name=302:15></a> And so Peter presents the one man, I suppose, in the New Testament who underwent the greatest and most humiliating discipline, that he might be fitted for his place as first among the apostles.<a name=302:16></a> His discipline was extremely humiliating, but it was necessary if he were really to be conformed to the sovereign will of God for him; that is to say, that he was the first, as Matthew presents it.<a name=302:17></a> Matthew presents the apostles in pairs, and the first is Peter; Mark presents them singly.<a name=302:18></a> I suppose Matthew has in mind the service of God in the form it took in the early days; he had in mind that God intended to present His best to men in His service; and so I have read that passage in the Acts because I understand that

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what you will find in the Acts is not so much what <i>God</i> told the apostles to do as what <i>they</i> did.<a name=303:2></a> I am not denying that they were told to do the things, far from it; I am perfectly certain that Peter was constantly in prayer to God about every movement of his in His service, but the Holy Spirit does not tell us about that in the early chapters of the Acts, He presents to us Peter with John going up to the temple to pray; it was a public thing.<a name=303:3></a> What Peter was publicly was undoubtedly the result of what he was with God privately, but in the Acts, God is presenting the <i>public</i> side of the testimony; and that is what I am seeking to present to you tonight -- that what God is looking for in every locality in which the people of God are found is correspondence with the anointed vessel: that there should be that publicly to which God can commit Himself and which He can employ as dignified for the setting forth publicly of His service and of His testimony.<a name=303:4></a>

		So in each locality He will have His way, and He will make His selection, and He will use whom He will.<a name=303:5></a> He works privately in their souls, He disciplines them and fits them by His work in them, and when they move publicly, their movements justify God in His selection.<a name=303:6></a>

		J.T.<a name=316:8></a> Take the first chapter.<a name=316:9></a> The names are given, there were a hundred and twenty names; and the Holy Spirit had not come, and there was a missing apostle.<a name=316:10></a> So Peter stands up among the brethren, it says -- a very suggestive thing -- and calls attention to the fact that Judas, having delivered up the Lord, had come to his bitter end, and there had to be another one appointed to take part of the ministry and apostleship; and he immediately quotes the Psalm that covers that position.<a name=316:11></a> He uses the Scriptures with spiritual intelligence even before the Holy Spirit came, showing that he was the product of the Lord's personal instruction.<a name=316:12></a> He had selected him, as it says, "he goes up into the mountain, and calls whom he himself would, .<a name=316:13></a>.<a name=316:14></a>.<a name=316:15></a> that they might be with him, and that he might send them to preach" (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#3:13">Mark  3:13</a>, 14).<a name=316:16></a> <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#10:2">Matthew  10:2</a> tells us that Peter was the first, and the Acts shows that he was first -- morally first -- that he was qualified to be it.<a name=316:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the second chapter he stands up with the eleven.<a name=317:4></a> It does not say the eleven stood up with him.<a name=317:5></a> The point is to show what Peter is doing; he stands up with the eleven, and preaches, and quotes the Psalms again; he quotes them to cover the position of the Spirit being here sent down from heaven.<a name=317:6></a> Then it says, "Those then that had accepted his word" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:41">Acts  2:41</a>), the Holy Spirit thus emphasising Peter's ministry -- not 'the word' but "<i>his</i> word".<a name=317:7></a> We have been given a divinely inspired account of "his word", and it is a wonderful address.<a name=317:8></a> "Those then who had accepted word were baptised; and there were added in that day about three thousand souls".<a name=317:9></a> The point is to show the result of Peter's ministry.<a name=317:10></a> At the end of the chapter, the Lord added every day -- "daily", but that particular day there were added three thousand souls.<a name=317:11></a> That shows what a minister Peter was.<a name=317:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then he advances on that in the next chapter.<a name=317:13></a> It says, "And Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, which is the ninth hour".<a name=317:14></a> There is a lame man at the Beautiful gate; he looked on Peter and John and asked for alms, but Peter says, "Silver and gold I have not", but "looking stedfastly on him with John, said, Look on us".<a name=317:15></a> The Holy Spirit mentions all this; Peter does not write the Acts, it is the Holy Spirit who records it all.<a name=317:16></a> He is calling attention to Peter.<a name=317:17></a> Peter and John were to be looked at.<a name=317:18></a> You preach the gospel here every Sunday night; suppose investigation is made as to those who preach, what would be found?<a name=317:19></a> Look on us, Peter could say.<a name=317:20></a> How solemn a consideration

		Matthew 23: 8 - 12; Psalm 133
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I wanted to speak in referring to these scriptures about our place and relation as brethren -- a designation that is familiar, not only amongst the saints of God, but amongst men generally.<a name=324:1></a> I wish to speak of it as it applies to the people of God, and to seek to show how this great relation is to be maintained amongst us as divinely designed and intended.<a name=324:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is worked out in the gospels; in the synoptic gospels, as we speak of them, on moral grounds, and in John's gospel on the ground of purpose; for it was a matter of purpose with God that He should have a family, and that that family should take the form of sons to Him, and of brethren to Christ.<a name=324:3></a> That is the standpoint from which this great matter is dealt with in John's gospel, whereas the other evangelists deal with it in moral grounds, and it can only be maintained whilst we are down here on moral grounds.<a name=324:4></a> The moral element will necessarily be dropped as we enter on the eternal thought for us; we shall then know and realise that what we enjoy is a matter of counsel, and is the outcome of the necessity of love, for love has its necessities, and the counsels of God are to meet those necessities.<a name=324:5></a> He has predestinated us unto sonship, by Jesus Christ to Himself.<a name=324:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then, further, Christ is to be the Firstborn among many brethren.<a name=324:7></a> Thus the matter is treated from the standpoint of counsel; and as we enter on our eternal portion, dear brethren, we shall know, we shall be conscious of this great fact, that we are there for the satisfaction of love, to meet the necessities of love.<a name=324:8></a> The position that God has wrought for the necessity of His own love could not be greater, nor could it be more sure.<a name=324:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=325>[Page 325]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then we are still here in the body, having to do with elements within ourselves and outside of ourselves, that tend to defile us; and so the great necessity for the synoptic gospels, for they deal with matters more on moral lines.<a name=325:1></a> John assures us of the permanency of the relation; he places it on the highest possible platform.<a name=325:2></a> The Lord said, as He was about to ascend into heaven, "go to my brethren", without the least reference to anything moral.<a name=325:3></a> "Go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God, and your God" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#20:17">John  20:17</a>) -- no qualifications, no reference to state, it is a question of counsel, it is the highest possible platform, and the surest, so that we start with that.<a name=325:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then, as I said, the synoptic gospels deal with the subject on moral grounds, so that Matthew and Mark bring the brethren of Christ into view on the ground of doing the will of God, not as a question of counsel.<a name=325:5></a> They are brought to light here on earth in everyday circumstances where evil is, by doing the will of God.<a name=325:6></a> It is one of the greatest things morally there can be, that there should be those in this world who do the will of God.<a name=325:7></a> The Lord Jesus brought in that thought; He set it out perfectly.<a name=325:8></a> "Lo, I come .<a name=325:9></a>.<a name=325:10></a>.<a name=325:11></a> to do O God, thy will" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:7">Hebrews  10:7</a>), He said.<a name=325:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The will of God runs into the future, I need not say.<a name=325:13></a> Ephesians perhaps brings that out as much as any epistle.<a name=325:14></a> We read there of the good pleasure of His will in relation to purpose; we read of the mystery of His will, and of the counsel of His will.<a name=325:15></a> He carries His will through, and will establish a world here where evil has been and is, in spite of that evil.<a name=325:16></a> There are no forces that can stand in the way of the will of God.<a name=325:17></a> That is Ephesians.<a name=325:18></a> Things are placed on that basis, but it works out in every believer, and he is marked off as one of the brethren of Christ by doing the will of God.<a name=325:19></a>
	</div>

		<a name=326>[Page 326]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is what Matthew states.<a name=326:1></a> Mark adds a thought which is suggestive of our own time.<a name=326:2></a> He adds the thought of a circle.<a name=326:3></a> As the mother and brethren of the Lord come to Him and desire to see Him, it says, "And looking around in a circuit at those that were sitting around him" (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#3:34">Mark  3:34</a>); there were those who were sitting around Christ and hearing what He said.<a name=326:4></a> They were not listening to what was going on in the world.<a name=326:5></a> They had none of those modern things in their houses through which the things of this world reach men's ears.<a name=326:6></a> They were sitting around Christ, that was what marked them.<a name=326:7></a> They were those marked off as sitting around Christ and listening to what He was saying, and He looked around on them in a circuit and said, "Behold my mother and my brethren".<a name=326:8></a> His brethren were those who did the will of God.<a name=326:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Luke adds a further thought, "my brethren are those who hear the word of God and do it" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#8:21">Luke  8:21</a>).<a name=326:10></a> That is not only the will, the divine authority, but the expression of the mind of God; God has a mind about things.<a name=326:11></a> He has things in His mind that He discloses by His word, and the brethren not only hear these things, but do them.<a name=326:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now these three evangelists, as you will see, connect the subject with what is moral, and it is from that point of view I wish to speak of brethren, because there are forces against us to nullify the relationship, and the affections that belong to the relationship.<a name=326:13></a> Satan is against the idea, because it is a divine idea; it is one of the most exalted thoughts connected with us.<a name=326:14></a> It is a primary thought with God, and what is primary is eternal.<a name=326:15></a> Satan is against it, and there are elements in every one of us which can be employed against the divine thought, and elements outside of us, too.<a name=326:16></a> So that we have to take account of these moral features if we are to be preserved in the blessed relation and affections of it.<a name=326:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=327>[Page 327]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have selected this passage from Matthew because this gospel has the assembly particularly in view, and the thought of brethren necessarily underlies the thought of the assembly.<a name=327:1></a> So in this remarkable chapter, in which the Lord denounces, in the most scathing terms, the scribes and Pharisees -- the leading educationalists and religionists of the day -- He says to His disciples, "be not ye called Rabbi;" and "call not any one your father upon the earth", and "Neither be called instructors, for one is your instructor, the Christ".<a name=327:2></a> "One is your instructor, and all <i>ye</i> are brethren".<a name=327:3></a> Peter was there doubtless, he who earlier in the gospel is said to be first in the apostolic list.<a name=327:4></a> He is to be one of the brethren.<a name=327:5></a> Were he not one of the brethren he could not be truly an apostle.<a name=327:6></a> Judas indeed was an apostle, but was not a brother, so his apostleship came to an end, and he fell by transgression.<a name=327:7></a> To be an apostle according to God, representing the authority of the Lord in the grace of the Lord, and in the love of the Lord, one has to be a brother first.<a name=327:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I refer for a moment, dear brethren, to the book of Genesis, because there we have worked out in type, and, to some extent in substance, the great thought of the family.<a name=327:9></a> No one who has read Genesis can fail to see that God is working out in one great stock, which He took up sovereignly, the thought of the family.<a name=327:10></a> It was all with design; the whole dispensation that He had in mind to set up in Israel was before Him in the book of Genesis, for God works according to plan always, and goes far back in order to prepare for what He brings out in service and in testimony.<a name=327:11></a> So you find Genesis full of reference to the family: children, fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, grandsons and granddaughters, and great-grandchildren; the great-grandfather nursing the great-grandchild.<a name=327:12></a> Is it there for nothing?<a name=327:13></a> Is it not written for our learning, that we
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=328>[Page 328]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		should know how to be in the family of God?<a name=328:1></a> The family of Jacob, which was broken up, is re-united and set up in Joseph, and there Jacob leaves the scene; he represents God in this connection.<a name=328:2></a> He was not an ordinary parent; the divine thought of a patriarch was seen in him, for he could bless Pharaoh, and he could bless the twelve tribes.<a name=328:3></a> He called Joseph and said to him, "I have given to thee one tract of land above thy brethren" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#48:22">Genesis  48:22</a>).<a name=328:4></a> You have the principle in that of one set up in pre-eminence, which is the case with ourselves.<a name=328:5></a> "I have given to thee one tract of land above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow".<a name=328:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have to understand that spiritually.<a name=328:7></a> He sets Joseph above his brethren; he was morally above them, as the previous chapters show, but now he is formally set above them by his father.<a name=328:8></a> Then Jacob calls his sons to him, the twelve sons, and he blesses them.<a name=328:9></a> "Listen", he says, "to Israel your father" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#49:2">Genesis  49:2</a>).<a name=328:10></a> It is on spiritual lines he is blessing them, and he blesses them all.<a name=328:11></a> Every tribe is blessed; however much there was to reprove, and rebuke, and condemn, every tribe was blessed.<a name=328:12></a> They were set on a sure footing, for the gifts and calling of God are without repentance, and the tribes are set up in blessing.<a name=328:13></a> Then they are carried over under the supervision of Joseph; they are in Egypt under his care.<a name=328:14></a> Thus you see how the family thread is maintained throughout Genesis, and Exodus is on that basis.<a name=328:15></a>

		So the great deliverer, Moses, typical of Christ, moved by instinct, as I may say, went out to see his <i>brethren</i>.<a name=328:16></a> It is a question of the family.<a name=328:17></a> It is well to note how the Spirit of God maintains the link in Exodus, and so the great superstructure of Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers is built upon the thought of the family; the priesthood, the levitical service, and the tabernacle system hinge on that.<a name=328:18></a> So that Moses

		The passage in Matthew furnishes us with very practical instructions, by which we may be saved from any family derangements, and by which we may maintain the blessed relation of brethren.<a name=330:9></a> He says, "one is your instructor".<a name=330:10></a> Neither be called instructors, or masters; it is not that a brother is not to be an instructor, nor a brother not to be a father, surely; the point is, am I <i>called</i> that?<a name=330:11></a> Have I acquired that designation?<a name=330:12></a> Christendom is full of it, from the Pope downwards.<a name=330:13></a> It is not that they are fathers, the point is that they are <i>called</i> fathers; they are known by that designation.<a name=330:14></a> Why should a brother not be a father?<a name=330:15></a> John writes to the fathers; he does not write to those who are called fathers, in an official way, but to all brethren who have grown and become matured; brethren who have known Him that is from the beginning; those are fathers, and there is a great need of them.<a name=330:16></a> The father is rare, because he represents mature experience with God; he represents mature knowledge of Christ as from the beginning.<a name=330:17></a> A father will hold to what is from the beginning, he will test everything by what is from the beginning, and hold fast to what is of God.<a name=330:18></a> He will not reject a thing because he has not known it before, he will test it and see if it conforms to what is from

		Now I just wanted to touch for a moment on the Psalm.<a name=332:2></a> There is hardly a psalm, perhaps, so well-known.<a name=332:3></a> The Holy Spirit dwells on the theme of it; it is the last but one of the Songs of Degrees.<a name=332:4></a> It conveys most beautiful thoughts.<a name=332:5></a> It is as if He said to us, I want to show you what it is for brethren to dwell together in unity; it is a lovely sight, a most exalted, a most precious thing.<a name=332:6></a> And so in describing it He goes back to the priestly system of which I have spoken; He goes back to that for an example to illustrate what He has in His mind; it is "Like the precious oil upon the head", He says, "that ran down upon the beard, upon Aaron's beard, that ran down to the hem of his garments;" that is to say, He likens it spiritually to Christ in His great personal distinction among the priests.<a name=332:7></a> It is not in the first instance a question of His exaltation to heaven, but of His great personal distinction.<a name=332:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From one point of view exaltation to heaven does not add to Christ -- nor can His glory be added to; that is from the personal point of view.<a name=332:9></a> The High Priest is the Son, consecrated for evermore; He is a divine Person; and He is elevated above us in that regard, so that He is the Head; it is the dignity of Christ, the great dignity of Christ personally as the priest that is spoken of.<a name=332:10></a> The anointing that ran down upon His beard denotes His beauty.<a name=332:11></a> You remember how the leper had to shave off all his hair, his head, his beard, and his eyebrows; all that in which I shine in any sense has to go.<a name=332:12></a> I am ashamed of it, I am an object of shame; the Lord alone is adorned; the believer has to be brought to that measure of growth.<a name=332:13></a> The leper had to be shaved completely and then he is brought to the door of the tabernacle, and set up afresh in the personal excellency of Christ, through the sacrifices.<a name=332:14></a> The allusion in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#133">Psalm  133</a>is to the

		In the second reference we have an allusion to the exaltation of the Lord into heaven; that is Ephesians.<a name=333:4></a> Colossians is the Person of the Lord; you cannot, as I said, add anything to Him by any office, He is personally great; that is Colossians.<a name=333:5></a> But Ephesians is the exalted Man; He has gone far above all heavens, so that the dew comes down from the top of Hermon, and descends to the mountains of Zion -- to the saints, viewed as taken up sovereignly.<a name=333:6></a> They love as brethren, they are together as brethren -- the brethren of John's gospel really.<a name=333:7></a> They are seen in relation to purpose, and they love, they are united and God takes account of it.<a name=333:8></a> The dew comes down upon the mountains of Zion -- the brethren are refreshed constantly; the blessing is commanded there -- life for evermore.<a name=333:9></a>

		I hope to dwell this evening, dear brethren, on these scriptures as presenting to us something of the depths of divine feelings, for that which came out in our Lord Jesus Christ in this respect conveyed the feelings of God -- an expression that bears consideration, so that there should be corresponding feelings in His people.<a name=334:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is said, "Jehovah repented that he had made Man on the earth, and it grieved him in his heart" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#6:6">Genesis  6:6</a>) -- a brief remark by the Spirit in early times, but which became amplified later, when it found its full expression in Jesus.<a name=334:2></a> In the Son of God as become Man God had the means of expressing His feelings.<a name=334:3></a> Of course His love underlies all, but I would confine myself on this occasion to His feelings, so that there may be concern as to corresponding feelings with us, for one is conscious in oneself, and one observes it, too, in others, how extremely shallow our spiritual feelings are.<a name=334:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so I wish to show how divine feelings express themselves, first in relation to man, generally, then in relation to God's chief interest on earth, and finally in relation to a brother.<a name=334:5></a> I think under these three heads we may hope to acquire some perception of divine feelings and compassions.<a name=334:6></a> There is particular aptness in the manner in which the gospel of John alludes to man.<a name=334:7></a> I refer to this because the gospel of John has such a direct bearing upon us.<a name=334:8></a> We owe to it, indeed, under God, the recovery of family affections and brotherly relations in life which we enjoy, and so, lest we should be unduly occupied with the family to the exclusion of the race as a whole, the gospel of John introduces man as primarily in the mind of God

		in the incoming of His beloved Son, for immediately after we have the statement of His Person it is said: "In him was life, and the life was the light of men" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:4">John  1:4</a>).<a name=335:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are thus notified at once that men were in the mind of God, and, as this gospel applies peculiarly to the last days, we see that God has not overlooked or forgotten men; the race is before Him today, as it was when Jesus was born.<a name=335:2></a> Hence, you find men introduced almost immediately and throughout "There was a man sent from God, his name John" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:6">John  1:6</a>), and again: "The true light was that which, coming into the world, lightens every man" (verse 9); "But there was a man from among the Pharisees .<a name=335:3></a>.<a name=335:4></a>.<a name=335:5></a> he came to him by night" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:1">John  3:1</a>, 2); and so you find throughout in that gospel the prominence of men.<a name=335:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Co-relatively with that is the prominence given to the Son of man -- the title Son of man.<a name=335:7></a> Then the Samaritan woman is a further illustration, for she went into the city, and spoke to the men.<a name=335:8></a> The Lord Himself speaks of a woman when she gives birth to a child remembering no more the anguish, for joy that a <i>man</i> is born into the world -- not a child or a babe, but a man (chapter 16: 21); and then again, in chapter 17: 6, "the men whom thou gavest me out of the world".<a name=335:9></a> All these references remind us of the place that men, as such, have in the mind of God.<a name=335:10></a>

		I have read from Samuel, because I apprehend that the passage alludes to what the Lord Jesus found in this world as coming into it.<a name=335:11></a> All was lost.<a name=335:12></a> It is not a question of man's responsibility, it is a question of the triumph, for the moment, of the enemy, as in another connection it is said, "A man that is an enemy has done this" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13:28">Matthew  13:28</a>).<a name=335:13></a> What devastation met His eye!<a name=335:14></a> Not indeed that it was new to Him, but now, being in manhood, the Lord Jesus could weep, He could feel, and express divine feelings.<a name=335:15></a> What awful desolation

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But as I have said, the passage in Samuel contemplates the immediate triumph of the enemy; it seemed to be complete.<a name=336:4></a> It is only in a little measure that we are in the presence of such circumstances -- that which seems to be a complete triumph of the enemy, something irretrievably lost, and that the thing which is dearest to us, the thing which we most cherished wrested from us, and on which all our thoughts and counsels depended, and on which all our desires centred.<a name=336:5></a> But think of the infinite knowledge of Christ as become Man in regard of all these things!<a name=336:6></a> What man was to God, how He had come into the garden to walk with him, as it were, calling for him, what His thoughts were, what He intended to set out in that being, how He intended that His glory should shine there.<a name=336:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Everything was perfectly in the mind of Jesus; He saw everything as it was in the mind of God; He was in every respect the expression of the mind of God and the feelings of God; He understood everything, as Man, as it was in the mind of God, and thus He took account of the scene as coming into it, and now He could weep.<a name=336:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I need not say there is nothing said about weeping in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#6">Genesis  6</a>, but it is said that "Jehovah repented that he had made Man .<a name=336:9></a>.<a name=336:10></a>.<a name=336:11></a> and it grieved him in his heart".<a name=336:12></a> But now we have, not only the grief, but the expression of the grief, not in words only, but in tears.<a name=336:13></a> And so here we have this remarkable statement that they "wept, until they had no more power to weep".<a name=336:14></a> Can we doubt for a moment that the very greatest disaster from the divine point of view is before us?<a name=336:15></a> Can we doubt that the picture represents something more than a mere city or a few hundred

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Although we have others with David, yet the Holy Spirit singles him out as peculiarly distressed, for added to the awful grief of the captivity of these people and the burning of the city, the men who were with him spoke of stoning him.<a name=337:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us dwell, for a little, on the feelings of our Lord Jesus Christ, when here upon earth, as He took a survey of things, as He alone could -- in going on to Gethsemane and the cross.<a name=337:4></a> We have to follow His footsteps; we have to follow Him into the garden and on to the cross to realise the depths of feeling in His mind -- those infinite depths of feeling in regard of the disaster; and in the picture in the chapter in Samuel we see that the people speak of stoning Him.<a name=337:5></a> It is only thus, I apprehend, that Gethsemane can be understood.<a name=337:6></a> There was there combined what words can never express -- His sense of the disaster, His sense of what it meant to God, and then what was before Him -- the awful desolation of the cross when all forsook Him and fled -- He alone, left to weep, as it were, left to express His feelings in regard of the general position, for He never was diverted for one moment from all that, He was with God in it -- infinitely so.<a name=337:7></a> He felt it as He alone could feel it; He felt is as a Man -- divine feelings expressed perfectly through a Man.<a name=337:8></a> He looked for comforters but found none.<a name=337:9></a> One would seek to direct the brethren to the narrative of His holy sufferings in Gethsemane and on the cross, so as to understand the depths of feeling that were there and how perfectly they were expressed.<a name=337:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And so with David, he strengthened himself in Jehovah his God; he had recourse to prayer and made enquiry, and the answer was that he would recover all.<a name=338:7></a> Now I would dwell on this particular feature although it is elementary; it is really the truth in Romans worked out in our souls.<a name=338:8></a> What you find in the chapter is that, having the mind of God, David proceeds, and a vessel is secured.<a name=338:9></a> One great feature of Romans is that it secures the body of the believer -- it secures him in newness of life, in newness of spirit, and with the renewal of his mind, so that he presents his body a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is his intelligent service, and in which he proves that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.<a name=338:10></a> And now what you find in this chapter is what corresponds with that -- a vessel who had not only been taken captive, but who had been employed by the enemy, and I may say that is what refers to every one of us.<a name=338:11></a> Our bodies have been instruments of our own wills, of sin, but they are now to be yielded up as instruments of righteousness to God.<a name=338:12></a>

		It is very beautiful to see in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#6">Genesis  6</a>, where it is said that Jehovah repented that He had made man and that it grieved Him in His heart, that it is immediately said, "But Noah found favour in the eyes of Jehovah".<a name=339:4></a> One man had found favour with God, and in that one man finding favour with God we have the gospel; we have a Head for men.<a name=339:5></a> And so the woman of Samaria, who represents what the truth in the epistle to the Romans can produce, as I understand it, understood that her body was to be a vessel for living water.<a name=339:6></a> She left her water-pot; she might have taken it back full and nothing been said about it, but the Holy Spirit says she left it, for He would call our attention to the fact that she understood the Lord's teaching -- that her body that had been so corrupt is now to be a vessel of living water, and so she speaks of Christ -- the Head.<a name=339:7></a> She says to the men, "Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done: is not he the Christ?<a name=339:8></a>" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#4:29">John  4:29</a>).<a name=339:9></a> She presents a Man for God; she has found Him -- the Man in whom God could reveal His mind and through whom He will accomplish everything, and she presents Him to men.<a name=339:10></a>

		THE ACCEPTANCE OF DEATH
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mark 16: 15, 16; Jeremiah 13: 1 - 11
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We see in this passage in Mark, which is particularly the preachers' gospel, the mandate that the eleven had from Christ to preach the gospel to every creature, or to all the creation, and that he that believed and was baptised should be saved.<a name=358:1></a> I wish to show from this latter statement that the Lord intended that those who believed the gospel should believe it in all its parts, and particularly that they should accept the necessity for death, of which baptism is a symbol.<a name=358:2></a> Baptism signifies that the believer accepts death; first that he accepts it as a penalty upon himself, and secondly, that he accepts the death of Jesus as bearing that penalty.<a name=358:3></a> There is therefore, in baptism, a definite acceptance of death, and I believe that the secret of the feeble realisation of salvation which many have, and consequently the small realisation of joy is due to the non-acceptance of death.<a name=358:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It may appear from these remarks as if I were emphasising baptism unduly, especially as Paul says that Christ sent him not to baptise but to preach the gospel, but we must not misconstrue the apostle's remark; he conveyed by it that he was not one like John the baptist -- sent to baptise; he was not a baptist in that sense.<a name=358:5></a> In saying that he was not sent to baptise but to preach the gospel, he did not mean that he did not preach baptism, for he did.<a name=358:6></a> It is true that in answering the enquiry of the Philippian jailer he said nothing about it; he said, "Believe on the Lord Jesus and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16:32">Acts  16:32</a>).<a name=358:7></a> That is what he said; it was one of the most remarkable answers that a sinner could get, especially a sinner who had a household, but

		then it adds "they spoke to him the word of the Lord", and the word of the Lord included what I have read, it included that men were to believe and to be baptised; and so the scripture says that the jailer was baptised, he and all his.<a name=359:1></a> It is quite obvious that he would not have suggested baptism as left to himself, but he learned from the apostle the significance of it, and he acted on it, and so it says he was baptised and all his straightway; that is to say, the word of the Lord spoken to him by the apostle conveyed to him the necessity of baptism, it conveyed to him the necessity of a definite acceptance, in a public way, of the death of Christ, and he acted upon it.<a name=359:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what I have said is in keeping with God's ways from the beginning, and wherever faith existed in man, death was accepted, and no one can come into salvation unless he accepts death -- unless he accepts it first as the penalty from God on account of sin, and secondly in the death of Christ as that which God recognises as meeting the penalty which lay upon him.<a name=359:3></a> So you find that the first believer in Scripture -- the first taken account of as a believer -- is Abel.<a name=359:4></a> I have no doubt that Adam believed, but Scripture begins with Abel as heading the list of faith, and it says his faith was evidenced in offering to God a more acceptable sacrifice than Cain.<a name=359:5></a> He brought a sacrifice which involved the recognition that death lay upon himself, and I would appeal to every one here at this time as to whether you have accepted death, whether you have realised that a direct penalty from God lies upon you, as it says, "In the day that thou eatest of it thou shalt certainly die" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:17">Genesis  2:17</a>).<a name=359:6></a> That was the penalty, and the first believer in Scripture accepted that, he said virtually, 'If I have to say to God I must accept that death is upon me and, in accepting that, I bring a sacrifice, I bring a creature that never sinned', and we see

		God accepted it, and that he was accepted.<a name=360:1></a> He was the first on that line; his death was not that of penalty, it was that of martyrdom, he was honoured; nor will the death of a believer be a penalty, for the penalty, beloved friends, has been executed for the believer.<a name=360:2></a> So that whilst Abel was the first to die a literal death, he did not suffer death as a penalty from God, he suffered it as a martyr; he stood for the testimony of God, he stood for the testimony as it was then, and acted upon it, and he died on that line.<a name=360:3></a> His was a wonderful death, his blood cried to God from the ground; it was precious, it was the blood, beloved friends, of a believer, one who had been accepted through an offering, through a sacrifice.<a name=360:4></a> He had accepted death and right down in the history of faith, you find that wherever faith existed, it was marked by the acceptance of death.<a name=360:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now you come to Seth; he was to take Abel's place; he was to be "instead of Abel".<a name=360:6></a> What you find in him is that when his son is born he calls his name "Enosh", meaning that the child was born to die; Enosh means man as <i>mortal</i>.<a name=360:7></a> What light there is in that for parents!<a name=360:8></a> Seth is the first parent who furnished light as to one's children; the first ray of light comes to the household through the farther of Enosh; he recognised that the child was born to die, so he called his name Enosh; in that name there was light, and so men then began to call on the name of the Lord.<a name=360:9></a> There was the acceptance of death, and right down the line of Enosh the Holy Spirit justifies Seth in so naming his son by telling us formally that each one of them died; not only Enosh, but Enosh's sons right down to the sixth generation from Adam died, the Holy Spirit thus confirming Seth's acceptance of death.<a name=360:10></a> No matter however long a man might have lived, eventually he died.<a name=360:11></a> We thus see how Scripture emphasises what I am speaking of in those who had faith.<a name=360:12></a>

		PRIESTHOOD IN ROMANS AND CORINTHIANS

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=370:1></a> I have in mind in suggesting these verses of Scripture that we may consider them in the light of priesthood.<a name=370:2></a> We take up the term priesthood from the epistles written to the Jewish believers, and from the types, but we ought to understand what it signifies in our own language, that is, in the language applicable to gentile, believers; and I believe the thing itself which is designated by the word 'priest' is found in all the epistles.<a name=370:3></a> It refers to those who have the Spirit; all who have the Spirit of God are priests, and I thought perhaps we might be helped in looking at it in Romans and Corinthians; the first dealing with the individual believer from the outset of his history, his spiritual history; and then the second, in relation to the place he has in the assembly.<a name=370:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Young believers particularly ought to understand that they are priests as having the Spirit, and that the normal experience of the believer from the outset involves what is priestly -- particularly in the Roman epistle, when he, in the process of the early experience in his soul, comes to discern that the law is spiritual.<a name=370:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It will be observed that the speaker in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>says he delights in the law of God after the inward man.<a name=370:6></a> It is there, I think, the foundation of priesthood is laid, for the priest is concerned with the law.<a name=370:7></a> He learns to value the law of God in its spiritual significance in his early experience, and thus becomes qualified to take up the law in the sense in which it is applicable to the assembly.<a name=370:8></a> So in the verse in Corinthians the man is tested as to whether he is spiritual by his recognising that the epistle is the commandment of the Lord intended to govern the assembly.<a name=370:9></a>

		I wish to speak this evening on educational lines, and I have selected these passages because they present to us incidents in Peter's education, so that he should be qualified to have part in the assembly, and in the administration of the kingdom of the heavens.<a name=389:1></a> These incidents are recorded in regard of Peter, because he is a model, or I should say, he represents a pupil believer.<a name=389:2></a> Everything in Scripture is written with design and forethought, and, I need not add, in wisdom, so that Peter is distinctly brought forward in this gospel -- in the others also, but particularly in this gospel -- in relation to divine administration.<a name=389:3></a> We are all to have part in that administration, and so it is well to go to school, so to speak, so as to qualify by divine education, by divine instruction, and discipline to come out in this administrative service.<a name=389:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, as I was remarking, we are put to school, for although one may educate oneself, speaking from an ordinary standpoint, as many do, yet the most effective way is to learn with others.<a name=389:5></a> We profit by their mistakes, for alas!<a name=389:6></a> as in ordinary, so in spiritual education, we all err; and then, too, we profit by the excellencies of the other pupils or learners.<a name=389:7></a> Great ability tends to quicken ability in others who possess it in a much less degree.<a name=389:8></a> Those who might not pass, so to speak, are at any rate stimulated by those who do; and so Peter is taken up by the Spirit, and set before us, particularly in this gospel, both in regard of that in which he excelled, and also of that in which he erred or failed.<a name=389:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there are scriptures that refer to Peter earlier in the gospel which I did not read, not wishing to

		<a name=390>[Page 390]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		occupy too much time in reading, but I may refer to them so that you may see how his education began and how it developed.<a name=390:1></a> What is to be noted is that Peter, in company with many others of those who served with distinction, was called out of <i>his business</i>.<a name=390:2></a> We are reminded in this fact of what might not have been observed by some of us, that God takes account of our business occupation.<a name=390:3></a> It is not a matter of accident that Peter is first introduced to us in this gospel, not only as a man engaged in the fishing industry, but engaged in it actively (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#4:18">Matthew  4:18</a>); as if the Holy Spirit would remind us that God looks for that, He looks for our best in that in which we may be legitimately engaged.<a name=390:4></a> And then another thing, mentioned by Luke, is that Peter and those engaged in the industry with him were washing their nets.<a name=390:5></a> In Matthew he is seen casting a net into the sea in company with his brother Andrew; that is to say, in his business relations he was evidently co-operating with his brother.<a name=390:6></a> If we are to go and qualify later for spiritual administration, we have to learn to co-operate with our brother or brethren.<a name=390:7></a> They were casting the net into the sea, the two were doing one thing: they were engaged in their work industriously, they were occupied in it.<a name=390:8></a> It was not merely their profession; but they were in the act of casting a net into the sea, for they could never secure a fish, if they did not do that.<a name=390:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, I only just touch on that, and pass on to the next mention we have of Peter, but I would especially call attention to the business; for many assume that the things of God are one thing, as it were, and business another, whereas God would indicate in this way, that the men whom He used, and who were distinguished by intelligence and faithfulness, and by results in His work, were men who were marked by care, by cleanliness, by attention to their secular calling and particularly in the washing;
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=391>[Page 391]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		for in no relation are we more exposed to defilement than in our business relations.<a name=391:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We come in contact with the world in the transaction of these, and therefore we are peculiarly exposed to what is unclean, and we come under the influence of what is unclean in our spirits, so Luke emphasises that they were washing their nets.<a name=391:2></a> So the instrumentalities of our business, the ramifications of our business, must come under the washing, or we shall presently become unclean, and so unfit for divine partnership, and disqualified for divine administration.<a name=391:3></a> They are called from this in Luke, called from their most successful business: they left all and followed the Lord.<a name=391:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, the next reference to Peter is in regard of his house (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#8:14">Matthew  8:14</a>); not that he himself required any particular service from the Lord in the incident recorded, when the Lord entered into his house.<a name=391:5></a> It was a relative by marriage, a mother-in-law; and the state of things in his house, which disqualified that house as a place of congeniality for the Lord was that it was a feverish house.<a name=391:6></a> We have had already today the thought of the house of Chloe, and that it was from her house -- whatever their relation to the meeting had been -- that the person came, who brought the tidings to Paul as to what existed at Corinth contrary to God.<a name=391:7></a> You see, therefore, how a man's relationships, the relatives in the house, may become useful even in the conveyance of important information.<a name=391:8></a> The second reference to Peter is in that connection, so that the Lord enters his house, and takes the hand of his mother-in-law, and the fever leaves her; that is to say, Peter had experience of the Lord not only in his business relations, but he had experience of the Lord also in his household relations.<a name=391:9></a> We must be right in both, and the Lord would put us right in both, if we are to be effective in the assembly, in the kingdom.<a name=391:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the next thing I will allude to is in <a href="../bible/chapter.htm#10:2">chapter  10:2</a>, where we see Peter designated the first of the apostles: "The first, Simon, who is called Peter".<a name=392:1></a> We see how he is selected sovereignly; the names are given, and it is said, "first, Simon".<a name=392:2></a> At this point in our histories we are reminded of divine selection, and one may then become the occasion of rivalry.<a name=392:3></a> If in my locality, God is pleased in His sovereign ways to put me forward, or to put you forward, to distinguish you, it is a test.<a name=392:4></a> I need grace in my business, and in my house, but now if I am signalised in relation to the ministry, and what God has given as distinguishing me locally or generally, I am tested in that.<a name=392:5></a> The sequel shows that Peter was equal to the position given him: he was morally qualified for it through divine education.<a name=392:6></a> But it is a supreme test to any one of us to be put forward in the sovereignty of God, and distinguished in His service.<a name=392:7></a> You will be exposed to rivalry.<a name=392:8></a> I need not enlarge on that.<a name=392:9></a> He that is first is to be last of all: that is how you get out of it, you will never get out of it otherwise.<a name=392:10></a> "If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of all", for no one in his senses will quarrel with me if I am serving him.<a name=392:11></a> He is not only to be last of all, but servant of all.<a name=392:12></a> That is the third point.<a name=392:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want now to show you in the first passage I read how Peter with the others was amenable to divine influence.<a name=392:14></a> If I am first, I am apt to assume that my will must rule, that my judgment must be right, and I have therefore to learn with others how to come under divine constraint.<a name=392:15></a> It says, "And immediately he compelled the disciples to go on board ship;" He compelled them.<a name=392:16></a> Were they not constrainable they would have missed this experience.<a name=392:17></a> Now this, dear brethren, is an important lesson for every one of us in the school of God -- the lesson of being constrainable; for after all you may just err a little, assuming

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What a fine picture that is morally!<a name=393:10></a> It is what the assembly is, a number of men and women who are brought into subjection to Christ, who have obeyed from the heart the form of teaching delivered them, who are amenable to divine restraint, to divine correction.<a name=393:11></a> That may work out through advice from one and another.<a name=393:12></a> We are to be subject one to another in the fear of Christ.<a name=393:13></a> I am not always right: it is quite possible I may err a little bit; why not think it over, and see the wisdom of divine compulsion?<a name=393:14></a> It is a remarkable picture, a number of men getting into a boat under divine compulsion.<a name=393:15></a>

		If I were in the boat by Peter, and saw him go out, and walk on the sea, I would say to myself, Why did I not do that?<a name=394:17></a> I am not learning as fast as Peter; and for that reason I am missing the privilege, otherwise why should I not have that great privilege of stepping out at the word of Christ, and walking on the water?<a name=394:18></a> So this man that progresses rapidly, as Peter did, has an experience that the others never had; nor shall we have it till we come up to the other.<a name=394:19></a> He is at school, but presently you see him sink; he is just a learner, a wonderful pupil, but nevertheless he has not graduated.<a name=394:20></a> Remarkable as

		Now I want to go on to the next passage I read, because I think you will see how Peter is progressing: he is learning to be <i>spiritual</i>.<a name=395:7></a> It is only when I am subject that I can ever hope to know the realisation of the support of the Lord, and to taste the laws that govern the spiritual universe.<a name=395:8></a> In chapter 16 I come to <i>revelation</i>, and here again you see how wisely Peter is put forward as a model pupil in the school of God.<a name=395:9></a> The Lord says, "Who do ye say that I am?<a name=395:10></a>" He questions them <i>all</i>.<a name=395:11></a> It is the school, and the education is for all in it, and the questioning brings out the intelligence of those who answer.<a name=395:12></a> Many will not answer, because they are ashamed to be exposed; but it is better to be exposed than to be ignorant.<a name=395:13></a> "My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge".<a name=395:14></a> Why then not go in for the knowledge that is available?<a name=395:15></a> You are at school, wonderful things are being taught; the Lord Himself is the teacher.<a name=395:16></a> He puts the question; they were all able to tell what <i>others</i> said.<a name=395:17></a>

		Current religious books tell what people are saying about Christ.<a name=395:18></a> I need not say, terrible things are being said about Him at the present time, and we do not want to be in any doubt about Christ; we must be clear about the Person of Christ above all things; we must have our hearts and minds fully

	<div class="paragraph">
		I cannot enlarge on this, but it is a wonderful subject: I only wanted to call attention to this particular stage in the believer's education; he has arrived at the point of revelation.<a name=396:7></a> You say, Are there revelations now?<a name=396:8></a> There are no revelations in the ordinary sense of the word, but there is the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him, and in a sense that is greater than revelation, greater than spiritual communications, for it involves having the spirit of them; I am in the realm of revelation, as Paul speaks of being caught up into paradise, where there were revelations of the Lord, and where he "heard unspeakable things said which it is not allowed to man to utter" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#12:4">2 Corinthians  12:4</a>).<a name=396:9></a> I only allude to that for the principle.<a name=396:10></a> At this stage of the believer's education he understands revelation, he is in the realm of revelation; he has the spirit of it.<a name=396:11></a> So the Lord says, "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona, for flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens".<a name=396:12></a> Thus you are outside the realm of flesh and blood, if you are in the realm of revelation, and if you understand what it is to be in that realm, where the Son of man is known to be the Christ, the Son of the living God, it will give character to you in every other relation.<a name=396:13></a>

		Now I must refer to the incident that follows, which
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=397>[Page 397]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		is a sad one, as showing that Peter was still learning, that he was not yet perfect.<a name=397:1></a> The Lord speaks about suffering, about going to Jerusalem to suffer and to die.<a name=397:2></a> Peter says to Him, as it were, 'Pity thyself', spare thyself, do not go that length; he is not equal to the light he has, for he has wonderful light.<a name=397:3></a> What God would effect in us as His pupils is regularity of education: not only that I have light, but that I am in accord with the light -- that my whole moral being is in accord with it.<a name=397:4></a> That a man who is in the light of the revelation should be saying to the Lord, that He should pity Himself, spare Himself, shows that he is not in accord with it.<a name=397:5></a> If he is saying that to the Lord, what would he say to himself?<a name=397:6></a> Why, he would say, 'Peter, you cannot undertake that, it involves too much cost, it involves too much suffering, too much deprivation; you must spare yourself, let others do it'.<a name=397:7></a> If you let others do it, it will not be done.<a name=397:8></a> If you see things are to be done, see to it that <i>you</i> do them; the principle of sacrifice comes in with the believer.<a name=397:9></a> Have I learnt to sacrifice?<a name=397:10></a> The Lord Jesus sets out in the fullest way that He is going to sacrifice; He leads the way, He goes to the limit of sacrifice for the will of God.<a name=397:11></a> What comes out in Romans?<a name=397:12></a> I yield everything I have.<a name=397:13></a> There is the sacrifice of my body.<a name=397:14></a> That is what the compassion of God works out in my soul; He has spared nothing.<a name=397:15></a> "He who, yea, has not spared his own Son, but delivered him up for us all" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:32">Romans  8:32</a>).<a name=397:16></a> God went to the full limit of sacrifice: what am I doing?<a name=397:17></a> Peter would have dissuaded the Lord from the way of sacrifice, and if he would have dissuaded the Lord from it, what would he have done himself?<a name=397:18></a> If the will of God is to be done in this world, it must be on the principle of sacrifice; so the Lord says to him, "Get away behind me, Satan".<a name=397:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the next two references are in chapter 17.<a name=398:13></a> Peter is now greatly honoured in being taken up to a high mountain by the Lord with James and John; it was a great opportunity.<a name=398:14></a> We have a great deal said about what we speak of as the 'morning meeting;' it is where we enter into privilege.<a name=398:15></a> Here are three men selected; I have no doubt they are the ones who had progressed most at school.<a name=398:16></a> The Lord takes them up into a high mountain, and it says, He "was transfigured before them".<a name=398:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I am tested on the high mountain, in the place of privilege.<a name=398:18></a> I have had revelation, and I have shown I am unequal to the light I have had, but the education goes on.<a name=398:19></a> Peter is rebuked.<a name=398:20></a> We may all thank the Lord for His faithfulness in rebuking the intrusion of the flesh, in giving place to Satan.<a name=398:21></a> No doubt Peter profited by the severe rebuke he had had, otherwise the Lord would not have taken him up to the mount; but he is taken up, and he is in presence of the transfiguration on high.<a name=398:22></a> The Lord is pleased to accord to us such privileges,

	<div class="paragraph">
		but how am I in the presence of them?<a name=399:1></a> As we are in the presence of the Lord together, we are put to the test as to how we regard Him, whether we can distinguish a divine Person.<a name=399:2></a> His face shines as the sun, and His clothing is white as the light, and presently we have Moses and Elijah speaking with Him.<a name=399:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, Peter, what about this education you have had?<a name=399:4></a> What about the revelation you had the other day?<a name=399:5></a> What about that confession you made?<a name=399:6></a> Where is it now?<a name=399:7></a> "Let us make here three tabernacles: for thee one, and for Moses one, and one for Elias".<a name=399:8></a> Ah!<a name=399:9></a> he had missed it; he will have to learn it all over again.<a name=399:10></a> That is how the thing goes: it shows up his conduct in the supreme place of privilege.<a name=399:11></a> He has not learnt the lessons of the last few days, he has missed them.<a name=399:12></a> "Three tabernacles" -- one for Moses, and one for Elijah, and one for Christ.<a name=399:13></a> Did you confess that Moses was the Son of the living God?<a name=399:14></a> Was Elijah the Son of the living God?<a name=399:15></a> You see how inconsistent he is.<a name=399:16></a> As the apostle says, "Each of you says, <i>I</i> am of Paul, and <i>I</i> of Apollos; and <i>I</i> of Cephas and <i>I</i> of Christ" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:12">1 Corinthians  1:12</a>).<a name=399:17></a> "Has Paul been crucified for you?<a name=399:18></a>" he says.<a name=399:19></a> How utterly illogical we are, placing men on the same footing as God, as the Son of the living God.<a name=399:20></a> Now Peter is rebuked by heaven; but nevertheless the rebuke is for his education: he is to remember for ever that no one can be put on the same platform as Christ.<a name=399:21></a> You must never, Peter, have it in your mind again, that the Son of God is on the same footing as the others; and so this voice from heaven comes, "<i>This</i> is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight: hear him".<a name=399:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, now, dear brethren, it must be assumed that this lesson would be learnt by Peter, once for all, that he would never again err on this line; and I call attention to this point, because one is conscious

	<div class="paragraph">
		in oneself how we have to learn the same lesson over and over again; and in the patience of God, it is often taught us.<a name=400:1></a> If I do not learn it today, God will teach it to me tomorrow; so the Father's voice from heaven had rebuked Peter by proclaiming that He had found His delight in one Person alone, His beloved Son.<a name=400:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Peter is in Capernaum, and someone says, "Does your teacher not pay the didrachmas?<a name=400:3></a>" The thing is sprung on him suddenly, as we may experience: we may be challenged in this way.<a name=400:4></a> I believe if Peter's soul had been full of what he had seen on the mount, of the revelation he had had, he would have said, My Master, my Master, why He is the Son of God.<a name=400:5></a> I have had a revelation in regard of Him; I have made a confession myself in regard of Him; I have heard a voice from heaven announcing Him as the Son of God.<a name=400:6></a> The Son of God does not pay tribute; He is not an ordinary man.<a name=400:7></a> Peter had not learnt these lessons; have we all learnt them?<a name=400:8></a> Are we in accord with the light that God has vouchsafed to us?<a name=400:9></a> If our hearts are full of the Son of God, if the question is put to us suddenly, we shall not be at a loss to answer.<a name=400:10></a> We certainly shall not say anything dishonouring to that Person.<a name=400:11></a> So Peter, forgetful of what had been said to him, says, "Yes".<a name=400:12></a> His confession to these men made manifest that his soul was not in the truth of the Person of Christ; he did not mean to deny it, but he was not equal to the light he had; it was not in his heart in any power, it was not in his soul.<a name=400:13></a> Whilst he did not answer to the test, the Lord says, Peter, you have to learn the lesson again; you have to know who I am, and moreover in learning this third time who I am, you will learn, too, that you also are a son.<a name=400:14></a> So it says, the Lord anticipated Peter; He knew what had happened.<a name=400:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Sometimes we dishonour Him, because we answer

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=401>[Page 401]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		according to what is in our heart.<a name=401:1></a> If Christ is in your heart, you will not say anything that would dishonour Him, you will guard His Person.<a name=401:2></a> So "when he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, What dost thou think, Simon?<a name=401:3></a> the kings of the earth, from whom do they receive custom or tribute?<a name=401:4></a> from their own sons or from strangers?<a name=401:5></a> Peter says to him, From strangers".<a name=401:6></a> He could answer that quickly enough, he knew what the kings of the earth did.<a name=401:7></a> That is it; you know what they do, but you do not know what God does.<a name=401:8></a> The assembly belongs to God: why should the sons have to pay tribute?<a name=401:9></a> The kings of the nations do not exact it from their sons; why should you say that God exacts it from His Son?<a name=401:10></a> You have not been learning.<a name=401:11></a> How we miss it through not learning what we are taught!<a name=401:12></a> So the narrative goes on, I cannot go into it further; but the point was, the sons are free.<a name=401:13></a> Take the piece of money, "and give unto them for me and thee".<a name=401:14></a> Now you see Peter lifted up in the school of God in his education to the platform of sonship, to the knowledge of the Son of God, whose face shone as the sun.<a name=401:15></a> Moses' face did not shine as the sun, nor did Elijah's, only the face of Jesus.<a name=401:16></a> The infinite goodness of God, rising above the wickedness of this world was expressed in that Person, and Peter now knows it.<a name=401:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now another point: the kingdom was composed of little children, so at the beginning of chapter 18 the Lord calls a little child unto Him, and sets him in the midst of them; setting forth that we are great enough to be small as we are divinely taught, we are great enough to be little.<a name=401:18></a> He called a little child; one would love to be within His call.<a name=401:19></a> Whenever troubles arise, the Lord would call, and point out one who is not pretentious.<a name=401:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Just one other thing: Peter did not know grace.<a name=401:21></a> The Lord had been wonderfully patient in teaching

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The book of the Acts gives us the finished product from the divine school; so in chapter 3 Peter says, "Look on us;" Peter and John are there as the product of the work of God.<a name=402:8></a> You want to look at perfection, and if you have not arrived at that, keep on.<a name=402:9></a> It is seen in Christ.<a name=402:10></a> Peter has some idea of grace, but not a perfect one -- "until seven times".<a name=402:11></a> The Lord says in effect, 'I never said that'.<a name=402:12></a> "I say not to thee until seven times, but until seventy times seven;" that is really that the grace is to be without a limit.<a name=402:13></a> If we are to be in the kingdom, our countenances must be like the sun.<a name=402:14></a> His countenance was like the sun, supreme goodness rising above the wickedness of this world.<a name=402:15></a> So as like God, you maintain the spirit of grace under all circumstances, and you are never overcome.<a name=402:16></a> "Be not overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12:21">Romans  12:21</a>).<a name=402:17></a> That is a great triumph; that is where Peter erred at the last point.<a name=402:18></a>

		I bring before you this thought of divine education, so that we may be exercised to learn our lessons, and thus know how to be in the assembly locally, and to administer in it, and also to be in the kingdom according to God.<a name=402:19></a>
