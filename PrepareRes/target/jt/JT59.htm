		I wish to speak of several things that, according to the passage of scripture I read, are to be <i>laid hold of</i>: if any have not laid hold of them, that they may do so; and those of us who have, that we may continue to hold them and explore them.<a name=1:1></a> The first is fellowship, the second is eternal life and the third is the calling on high of God.<a name=1:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Fellowship is involved in the passage I read from Acts.<a name=1:3></a> It has a distinctive place in that book and we read that the early converts <i>persevered</i> in it.<a name=1:4></a> The second chapter shows that there was a large number of converts; it was the firstfruits of the Spirit through apostolic preaching, Peter being the first to preach.<a name=1:5></a> According to Matthew he has the first place, "First, Simon".<a name=1:6></a> He had well nigh forfeited it, from outward appearances at least; but the Lord had laid hold of him when he was a fisherman and said He would make him a fisher of men, which he did.<a name=1:7></a> Peter as a disciple of Christ failed most seriously, but before he failed the Lord said "I have besought for thee".<a name=1:8></a> That is a very comforting thing.<a name=1:9></a> A failure is never to be excused, but if the Lord prays for us His prayer is heard, and He is said to be a great High Priest over the house of God, and we <i>have</i> Him: "having a great priest over the house of God, let us approach with a true heart", (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:21">Hebrews  10:21</a>.<a name=1:10></a>) Of course, He has us, but we have Him, and He is available as a Priest.<a name=1:11></a> He is a High Priest above and intercedes for us as Scripture says, "Who also intercedes for us", (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:34">Romans  8:34</a>.<a name=1:12></a>) The Holy Spirit also intercedes for us, and we are to intercede for one another.<a name=1:13></a> So that we can thank God for the wonderful

		system of intercession we have, first what is in Christ, then in the Spirit and then in the saints.<a name=2:1></a> We are all thus wonderfully well off.<a name=2:2></a> But we are to avail ourselves of what there is, and having a great High Priest let us draw near; we can ask Him to help us, and He is ready to help us.<a name=2:3></a> He helped Peter; He said, "<i>I</i> have besought for thee that thy faith fail not", (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22:32">Luke  22:32</a>.<a name=2:4></a>) So that Peter was secured for the service of God.<a name=2:5></a> The Lord had laid hold of him for it, and He would not let Him go; He secured Him.<a name=2:6></a> So that he stands up after the Holy Spirit came down from heaven and preached the first gospel recorded after the advent of the Spirit, with the greatest results of any that we know-three thousand persons They were genuinely affected, and we are told that they persevered in the leading Christian characteristics; they were real believers, convicted people who wanted to be saved, and Peter told them how to be saved.<a name=2:7></a> It is interesting to note the answer that he gave them as compared with the answer that Paul and Silas gave to the jailer.<a name=2:8></a> But Peter's converts, we are told, persevered in the apostles' teaching and fellowship and breaking of bread and prayers.<a name=2:9></a> That is the point I am thinking of in chapter 2.<a name=2:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this chapter it is not three thousand, it is just one convert.<a name=2:11></a> If as much were made of each of the three thousand in chapter 2 as of this one, we should have, I may say, a whole Bible full of facts about them.<a name=2:12></a> But this single convert in chapter 3 has a great place.<a name=2:13></a> We do not get his name, but we do get what implies his name, that he was a persevering man.<a name=2:14></a> Peter and John were used of God for his conversion.<a name=2:15></a> God used the two greatest men on earth at that time to convert a man of no consequence whatever to the great men of the world of that day.<a name=2:16></a> He was a liability on the community; he sat at the gate of the temple asking alms.<a name=2:17></a> He was a liability and not a producer, and yet, as I said, heaven employed the two greatest men on earth at that time to convert this man, to secure him

		for God.<a name=3:1></a> Peter says to him, 'I cannot help you on your own line'.<a name=3:2></a> There are those who want to come into christianity on their own terms, and to come into fellowship is under the Lord's control; the heavenly city has gates, and there are porters at the gates, and hence divine requirements must be met.<a name=3:3></a> Nor did this man get in on his own terms, on his own line.<a name=3:4></a> What was his line?<a name=3:5></a> Begging.<a name=3:6></a> Lameness marked him; begging marked him, his very look would imply the word 'beg'.<a name=3:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Peter says to him, "Look on us".<a name=3:8></a> They did not say what they might have said: We represent what is greatest in the universe; we represent God and Christ and the Spirit: salvation, eternal life, and the gift of the Spirit are available to all.<a name=3:9></a> They did not say these things to him.<a name=3:10></a> When the Lord Jesus began to preach He did not say these things.<a name=3:11></a> He said to His hearers, "The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God has drawn nigh; repent and believe in the glad tidings", (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#1:15">Mark  1:15</a>) as much as to say, You will find out what is in it if you look into it.<a name=3:12></a> "Believe <i>in</i> the glad tidings", the Lord says: accept them as a whole and explore them.<a name=3:13></a> Peter and John did not tell this man everything; he is to deliver the message.<a name=3:14></a> Peter says, "Look on us.<a name=3:15></a>.<a name=3:16></a>.<a name=3:17></a>.<a name=3:18></a> Silver and gold I have not"; that is to say, 'I cannot deal with you on your own terms; I have no money and you are looking for money'.<a name=3:19></a> "Silver and gold I have not; but what I have, I give to thee", (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#3:6">Acts  3:6</a>).<a name=3:20></a>

		A christian is not worth the name of christian if he has not something spiritual.<a name=3:21></a> Peter says 'Such as I have', not simply what God has or what Christ has, but what <i>I</i> have; he had something.<a name=3:22></a> He says, "In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene rise up and walk.<a name=3:23></a> And having taken hold of him by the right hand .<a name=3:24></a>.<a name=3:25></a>.<a name=3:26></a>" He knew which hand to take; Peter uses his hand often; he was a fisherman.<a name=3:27></a> Now he takes hold of this man's hand, and the man

		rose up and leaped and stood and walked and praised God.<a name=4:1></a> That is how this chapter presents the truth to us, and the verse I read is to show that this man was holding the persons whom God had used to bless him; he was <i>holding</i> them.<a name=4:2></a> You remember the man in the porch of Bethesda whom the Lord Jesus raised up: He said to him, "Take up thy couch and walk".<a name=4:3></a> The man went away with his couch and did not even know the Lord Jesus; he did not know where the Lord went, he could say very little about him.<a name=4:4></a> This man was different; he held Peter and John.<a name=4:5></a> You might say, perhaps John held him.<a name=4:6></a> He would if it were necessary, but it was not necessary; he represents an ardent convert, one who was genuinely converted, who is prepared to go in for all there is in the gospel and the consequences thereof.<a name=4:7></a> He was standing up holding these two men, and they were under fierce persecution.<a name=4:8></a> As the stormy blast of persecution struck them he stood by them, but in this verse it says he held them.<a name=4:9></a> He wanted to be identified with them in the fullest possible way.<a name=4:10></a> He was no mere nominal professor in fellowship; he was really in it and a contributor to the fellowship; he laid hold of it.<a name=4:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is my first point.<a name=4:12></a> We are not worthy of the name of christian if we are not real christians.<a name=4:13></a> Think of this man after he arose and leaped and walked, with his ankle bones made strong, going off to a football match!<a name=4:14></a> It is impossible to think of him so inconsistent.<a name=4:15></a> Peter and John are my companions, he would say; the heavenly representatives, the servants of God.<a name=4:16></a> None of these other things are good enough for me, I belong to heaven; I want fellowship, I want the meetings and the Bible readings and the ministry.<a name=4:17></a> I belong to Christ, I am no earth-dweller.<a name=4:18></a> This man would not understand these things yet he would say, in effect, I am a genuine christian, I am thoroughly with these two men; I am holding Peter with my right hand and John with my left hand, as it were.<a name=4:19></a> He was a real testimony; he was the

		cause of the persecution, but the religious authorities could not deny the power that raised that man.<a name=5:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us face these things as to what christianity is to us, as to whether or not we are shams.<a name=5:2></a> This man held the apostles.<a name=5:3></a> Think of the space the Spirit of God gives to one man!<a name=5:4></a> There were three thousand converts in the previous chapter but as we have said, the space given to them is very small indeed.<a name=5:5></a> As John says of the Lord, "There are also many other things which Jesus did, the which if they were written one by one .<a name=5:6></a>.<a name=5:7></a>.<a name=5:8></a> not even the world itself would contain the books written".<a name=5:9></a> So that there is very little said comparatively, of the three thousand, but this is said of them, that they "persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers".<a name=5:10></a> What a contrast that is to those who give up the breaking of bread, to those who tell their brethren, I am withdrawing!<a name=5:11></a> Withdrawing from what?<a name=5:12></a> Withdrawing from God and heaven.<a name=5:13></a> They might as well say, I am turning my back on God, because that is what they are doing.<a name=5:14></a> But this man's face is towards heaven.<a name=5:15></a> In a sense there was not a more interesting man in the whole city of Jerusalem than this man at that time.<a name=5:16></a> All the people saw him; what a testimony he was!<a name=5:17></a> He had been well known before; but the idea of the truth and the fellowship is that whereas he had been the subject of sin, now he is the subject of the work of God.<a name=5:18></a> He was true to the position locally and to the responsibility attaching to it; he held Peter and held John, meaning that he was thoroughly in fellowship; as Ruth said to Naomi, "Thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God; where thou diest will I die, and there will I be buried".<a name=5:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These two men represented Jesus Christ, the despised, the rejected One, and this man says, They are my companions.<a name=5:20></a> The point now is whether <i>we</i> are availing ourselves of this fellowship, holding to it.<a name=5:21></a> What kind of a fellowship is it?<a name=5:22></a> The first letter to the Corinthians gives

		us its characteristics, as also John's first epistle.<a name=6:1></a> It is the fellowship of God's Son.<a name=6:2></a> Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=6:3></a> Are you going to leave that fellowship?<a name=6:4></a> There is no greater folly than that.<a name=6:5></a> It is the fellowship of God's Son and God has called you into it.<a name=6:6></a> Think of the privilege and protection of it, the joy and the life of it; the fellowship of God's Son and the fellowship of the brethren!<a name=6:7></a> Can I afford to be without the brethren?<a name=6:8></a> Can I afford to make little of them if I am professedly one of them?<a name=6:9></a> If I do, the Lord is stronger than I; and He is jealous if I am making little of His fellowship, that into which I am called.<a name=6:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next thing is eternal life as spoken of in <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#6">1 Timothy  6</a>.<a name=6:11></a> Now the subject of eternal life is one of the most important in the Scriptures.<a name=6:12></a> It is spoken of very early- the tree of life is an allusion to it.<a name=6:13></a> The tree of life was not guarded at the outset, nor was the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; but after Adam and Eve transgressed they were driven out of the garden and the Cherubim and a flaming sword were set towards the east of the garden of Eden to guard the way to the tree of life, lest they should return and eat of the tree of life and live forever in their sins.<a name=6:14></a> It would be a disaster.<a name=6:15></a> God says, It must not be.<a name=6:16></a> Let no-one think he can have eternal life on those lines.<a name=6:17></a> Adam and Eve were driven out from the garden and from the tree of life; they could never get back as they were.<a name=6:18></a> Man can only be recovered by death, and the Lord Jesus has come into this works to resolve the great question of good and evil; He dies and brought life and incorruptibility to light through the gospel.<a name=6:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		John makes much of that in saying that God so loved the world.<a name=6:20></a> It seems as though when John got to that theme in the chapter, he said I will stop here; I must stop here and dwell on this wonderful theme of love.<a name=6:21></a> Verse 14 of chapter 3 is a wonderful text: "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, thus must the Son

		of man be lifted up, that every one who believes on him may not perish, but have life eternal".<a name=7:1></a> That is the first thing-"as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness".<a name=7:2></a> In the wilderness people were dying all around; their carcasses were strewn there because of man's will; they had refused the pleasant land.<a name=7:3></a> The gospel of heaven was preached to them, the gospel of the land, and their hearts became hardened.<a name=7:4></a> They hardened them.<a name=7:5></a> Let no one here be on that line of hardening his heart; "Harden not your hearts", it says in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#4">Hebrews  4</a>It is within your range to harden your heart; the devil helps by worldliness, by earthly mindedness, so that the heart becomes stony; the meetings of the brethren thus become affected if attended in a perfunctory way.<a name=7:6></a> You are responsible for it if your heart becomes hardened.<a name=7:7></a> That was how it stood with the children of Israel, and so God says to them, 'Not one of those persons who have seen My signs in Egypt shall enter into My land except two men, Caleb and Joshua'.<a name=7:8></a> Two men out of six hundred thousand!<a name=7:9></a> Those who died in the wilderness did not get the dignified name of 'bodies'; it says "their carcasses" were strewn there.<a name=7:10></a> That is the impression of heaven, the reproach of the name of carcasses for those who fell in their lawlessness, in disregard of the gospel of God in the Wilderness.<a name=7:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now God says, I will make a way of life; they are not all to die in the wilderness, the children are going in.<a name=7:12></a> One generation passes away and another comes; "These shall go away", says the Lord, "into eternal punishment, and the righteous into eternal life", (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#25:46">Matthew  25:46</a>.<a name=7:13></a>) Which way will you go?<a name=7:14></a> As to the generation that follows, God says in mercy, the children shall go in; there is a promise to the children.<a name=7:15></a> And God says, I will lift up this brazen serpent; the word 'serpent' meaning that God is dealing with the evil at its source.<a name=7:16></a> So with the city whose situation was good but its water bad, Elisha deals with the source.<a name=7:17></a> He says, "Bring me a new cruse, and put salt in

		it", (<a href="../bible/2Kings.htm#2:20">2 Kings  2:20</a> - 22) and he casts it in at the source of the waters, and they were healed.<a name=8:1></a> God says, I must judge sin at its source; so He told Moses to make a serpent of brass and put it on a pole.<a name=8:2></a> Everyone could see that serpent of brass from the uttermost limits of the camp; it was on a pole, "lifted up", as Jesus was.<a name=8:3></a> Three times the Lord says in John that He would be lifted up -- what for?<a name=8:4></a> He was lifted up as Jesus to bear sins.<a name=8:5></a> "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, thus must the Son of man be lifted up, that every one who believes on him may not perish, but have life eternal.<a name=8:6></a> For God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believes on him may not perish, but have life eternal" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:14">John  3:14</a> - 16).<a name=8:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This matter of eternal life as set out in Timothy is not simply an objective matter that you believe and have it objectively; but it is within your range.<a name=8:8></a> As Paul wrote to Timothy, "Lay hold of eternal life", (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#6:12">1 Timothy  6:12</a>) John says eternal life is in Christ Jesus, it is in the Son; that is to say, it is in a sure position, but it is not so put here.<a name=8:9></a> In this setting you may, as it were, put your hand out and take it.<a name=8:10></a> Of course this is a spiritual transaction.<a name=8:11></a> Why should I be spiritually dead when eternal life is within reach?<a name=8:12></a> In verse 19 of the same chapter the apostle says, "Lay hold of what is really life".<a name=8:13></a> These are most important matters, dear brethren that I am bringing before you, as to fellowship, and as to eternal life, and the purposes of God.<a name=8:14></a> Let us be real, let us be transparent.<a name=8:15></a> We read in Revelation of those that had gained the victory over the beast standing on a sea of glass, having harps of God.<a name=8:16></a> Why did they have harps and sing?<a name=8:17></a> Because they had overcome; they had overcome the beast and his image and the number of his name.<a name=8:18></a> They were men of energy, and they have harps and sing the song of Moses and the song of the Lamb, <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#15:2">Revelation  15:2</a>, 3.<a name=8:19></a> They are standing on the sea of glass triumphantly, they are victorious.<a name=8:20></a> God is pressing upon His people the

		reality of the present moment: we are coming to the very limit of the dispensation, we are going to heaven in a moment, and He wants to take us up as those that please Him.<a name=9:1></a> Enoch had the testimony that he pleased God, and we all need to find out whether we are walking according to God and for his pleasure as we are about to be translated.<a name=9:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, there is the third point in mind, "the calling on high of God".<a name=9:3></a> In (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3:11">Philippians  3:11</a> - 14) the apostle says: "if any way I arrive at the resurrection from among the dead.<a name=9:4></a> Not that I have already obtained the prize, or am already perfected; but I pursue, if also I may get possession of it, seeing that also I have been taken possession of by Christ Jesus.<a name=9:5></a> Brethren <i>I</i> do not count to have got possession myself; but one thing -- forgetting the things behind, and stretching out to the things before, I pursue, looking towards the goal, for the prize of the calling on high of God in Christ Jesus".<a name=9:6></a> This requires the greatest effort of all -- that is the idea, it is energy exercised with a definite purpose.<a name=9:7></a> It is something before me that I see and earnestly want to reach.<a name=9:8></a> That is the language of this passage.<a name=9:9></a> The point to be attained is the resurrection from among the dead.<a name=9:10></a> You say I can hardly take in how a man can reach or attain to the resurrection from among the dead; one must die before he can reach that; but Paul is speaking of what is attainable while he was still alive in his body.<a name=9:11></a> If we do not understand it, let us ask the Lord who gives understanding in all things.<a name=9:12></a> What did Paul have in his mind when he tells us that he died daily?<a name=9:13></a> "Daily I die", he says, "by your boasting which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord", (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:31">1 Corinthians  15:31</a>.<a name=9:14></a>) And again he says that in their tribulation in Asia, "We were excessively pressed beyond our power, so as to despair even of living.<a name=9:15></a> But we ourselves had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not have our trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead; who has delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver; in

		whom we confide that he will also deliver", (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#1:8">2 Corinthians  1:8</a> - 10.<a name=10:1></a>) Think of the man who is speaking to us.<a name=10:2></a> He tells us, "I know a man in Christ".<a name=10:3></a> I wonder if we all know a man in Christ?<a name=10:4></a> Do I know a man in Christ?<a name=10:5></a> I just put that question simply.<a name=10:6></a> It is not in the second or third person, it must be myself.<a name=10:7></a> There is no other way of knowing a man in Christ but by knowing him to be yourself; it is <i>conscious</i> knowledge, see note on <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#12:2">2 Corinthians  12:2</a>.<a name=10:8></a> It is a subjective condition, and you can only be understood subjectively.<a name=10:9></a> He said, "I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I know not, or out of the body I know not, God knows;) such a one caught up to the third heaven .<a name=10:10></a>.<a name=10:11></a>.<a name=10:12></a> caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable things said which it is not allowed to man to utter".<a name=10:13></a> (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#12:2">2 Corinthians  12:2</a> - 4.<a name=10:14></a>) It was indeed an extraordinary experience, but Paul for God's wise purpose was privileged to be the man to have it.<a name=10:15></a> And he says, I know that man.<a name=10:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then he speaks in the passage before us here of laying hold of the resurrection, attaining to it, "if any way I arrive at the resurrection from among the dead".<a name=10:17></a> He means laying hold of it.<a name=10:18></a> The early christians understood what ecstasy meant.<a name=10:19></a> They set before us conditions that are possible, that is on the principle of laying hold of them, and it is what you get there; "if any way I arrive at the resurrection from among the dead;" that I might sense, even if but for a moment, what passing out of death into life is.<a name=10:20></a> I cannot define it to you, nor can anybody define it to you; in the same sense, you cannot define love, you have to realise it yourself and show it.<a name=10:21></a> It implies definiteness of purpose -- of laying oneself out for something to be supremely desired.<a name=10:22></a> So the apostle goes on, "Not that I have already obtained the prize .<a name=10:23></a>.<a name=10:24></a>.<a name=10:25></a> but I pursue, if also I may get possession of it, seeing that also I have been taken possession of by Christ Jesus".<a name=10:26></a> The apostle's thought was to lay hold "of the calling on high

		of God in Christ Jesus" not as a matter of light simply, but the apprehension and realisation of it in a spiritual way.<a name=11:1></a> The athletic figure expressed in stretching out, pursuing, looking towards the goal speaks strikingly of the reality of the apostle's experience.<a name=11:2></a> The goal when reached involved the prize of the calling on high of God in Christ Jesus.<a name=11:3></a> He saw Christ as He is now.<a name=11:4></a> He saw the Lord Jesus as He is in heaven.<a name=11:5></a> He says If I have known Christ after the flesh, I do not know him thus anymore; this is Christ up there, and we are to see Him up there now, apprehend Him as there.<a name=11:6></a> John says, "What we shall be has not yet been manifested; we know that if it is manifested we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is".<a name=11:7></a> John comes near to Paul in this statement.<a name=11:8></a>

		J.T.<a name=15:1></a> It is thought well to look into the subject of the kingdom of God.<a name=15:2></a> It may seem odd that in connection with the kingdom of God we should read from a book that mentions it formally only once -- in chapter 14.<a name=15:3></a> References to the kingdom in the epistles as compared with the gospels are very few, but this apparent difficulty is because the epistles treat directly of the kingdom of God as it is in its present form, and that the thing <i>exists</i>, whereas the gospels contemplate it as in the future; that is yet to come.<a name=15:4></a> The Lord taught the disciples to pray, saying ".<a name=15:5></a>.<a name=15:6></a>.<a name=15:7></a> thy kingdom come", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#11:3">Luke  11:3</a>; and He preached that the kingdom of the heavens was at hand, <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#4:17">Matthew  4:17</a> Later however, He told the Jews that the kingdom of God was in the midst of them, <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#17:21">Luke  17:21</a>; but this alluded to His own presence there.<a name=15:8></a> But the epistles, as was remarked, contemplate it as existent in the saints, Christ being in heaven and the Holy Spirit being on earth.<a name=15:9></a> That is the reason, it is thought, for the paucity of the mention of the kingdom in the epistles: that it actually exists, not only in Christ but also in the saints; not in name only but in substance and character, Christ being in heaven and the Holy Spirit being on earth.<a name=15:10></a> In no scripture is it more treated of than in Romans, and that is why these three scriptures in that epistle were read.<a name=15:11></a> Chapter 1 brings in the King Himself; that is, from the standpoint of His relations with David.<a name=15:12></a> In this sense it corresponds with Matthew, for Matthew begins with Him in this relation: "Book of the generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham".<a name=15:13></a> (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#1:1">Matthew  1:1</a>).<a name=15:14></a> And when we come to the genealogy David is mentioned as "the king".<a name=15:15></a> Romans speaks of Christ's identification with David: ".<a name=15:16></a>.<a name=15:17></a>.<a name=15:18></a> come of David's seed according to flesh, marked out Son of God in power, according to the

		J.T.<a name=100:1></a> The brethren are aware that our subject at these readings this season is the kingdom of God.<a name=100:2></a> We have looked through Romans with the quest of understanding as to it, and at our last reading we had 1 Corinthians to see how the kingdom relates to the assembly.<a name=100:3></a> We looked at the earlier chapters, and it is suggested, as has been spoken of amongst us, that we should look at the second epistle to the Corinthians at this time.<a name=100:4></a> We can only be very cursory, for many books have yet to be looked into.<a name=100:5></a> At our last reading, as already remarked, we looked at the first letter to Corinth, and we were led to consider the matter of evidence in relation to assembly administrations-first, the evidence of the house of Chloe which reported that there was division among the saints in Corinth, chapter 1:11; and then in regard of chapter 5, the incestuous man whom Paul would have put away from among them.<a name=100:6></a> These two scriptures occupied most of our time, particularly because they had reference to current things amongst us.<a name=100:7></a> It was thought that the assembly was losing its place in administrative matters.<a name=100:8></a> The Lord helped at Corinth and the judicial action was carried out according to the apostle's direction, that in the power of our Lord Jesus Christ with Paul's spirit, and the Corinthians themselves in assembly, they should deliver the guilty man to Satan for the destruction of the flesh.<a name=100:9></a> Our present epistle shows that that judgment was carried out.<a name=100:10></a> Chapter 7, in the passage we read, shows how it was carried out.<a name=100:11></a> Verse 11 says, "For, behold, this same thing, your being grieved according to God, how much diligence it wrought in you, but what excusing of yourselves", meaning that they were ashamed of themselves because of the tolerance of evil amongst them, which now had been dealt with.<a name=100:12></a> Then

		the apostle goes on, "But what indignation, but what fear, but what ardent desire, but what zeal, but what vengeance: in every way ye have proved yourselves to be pure in the matter".<a name=101:1></a> This shows, as was remarked, that the matter of judgment which was ordered by the apostle was carried out, and it would seem, with righteous severity.<a name=101:2></a> Now, what appears in our first scripture read, chapter 2:1 - 11, is that whilst they carried out the judgment rightly, they were failing in recognising the work of God in the man when it began to take effect.<a name=101:3></a> It is said in chapter 2:6, "Sufficient to such a one is this rebuke which has been inflicted by the many; so that on the contrary ye should rather shew grace and encourage, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with excessive grief".<a name=101:4></a> It seems that there are important lessons for us in this, first, as to tolerance of evil; how serious it is, and yet at the same time the saints were puffed up while allowing it, according to what the apostle says in chapter 5 of the first letter; and then, after the discipline had become effective in bringing about repentance, the evidence of the work of God, the Corinthians were tardy in recognizing what God had effected.<a name=101:5></a> This is a matter of extreme importance for us; that we should not be slow in recognising the work of grace in whomsoever it may be.<a name=101:6></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=103:20></a> That came up at our last reading, and it reminds us of what was spoken of at that time, that the assembly has ears.<a name=103:21></a> The ears of the assembly are spoken of in (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#11:22">Acts  11:22</a>) and, of course, these ears are of those who form the assembly, and they take in things that are interesting to God and further His work.<a name=103:22></a> Therefore Paul was informed as to the evil at Corinth; in fact what was evident at Corinth as regards the incestuous man was a matter of common report.<a name=103:23></a> We are not told who

		J.T.<a name=189:1></a> It is proposed that we look again at the gospel of Matthew in pursuing our subject.<a name=189:2></a> We have previously considered certain parts from chapter 1 to the end of chapter 5.<a name=189:3></a> The kingdom of the heavens is peculiarly marked out in this gospel.<a name=189:4></a> We have, for instance, in the last paragraph of chapter 4, an allusion to the work of the Lord, involving the kingdom.<a name=189:5></a> It says, "And Jesus went round the whole of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the glad tidings of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every bodily weakness among the people.<a name=189:6></a> And his fame went out into the whole of Syria, and they brought to him all that were ill, suffering under various diseases and pains, and those possessed by demons, and lunatics, and paralytics; and he healed them", verses 23 - 25.<a name=189:7></a> And in chapter 9, which we have just read, there is a similar thought in the closing verses, only that there are certain variations, the Spirit of God calling attention to the extraordinary works of power of the Lord Jesus.<a name=189:8></a> All this enters into the idea of the kingdom, which is before us.<a name=189:9></a> And in chapter 12, the verses read, "But if by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then indeed the kingdom of God is come upon you.<a name=189:10></a> Or how can any one enter into the house of the strong man and plunder his goods, unless first he bind the strong man?<a name=189:11></a> and then he will plunder his house", verses 28, 29.<a name=189:12></a> And then, attached to these verses is another point of great importance, namely, a judicial or punitive feature which enters into this matter, because of a word or saying against the Spirit.<a name=189:13></a> In chapter 9 it says, "But the Pharisees said.<a name=189:14></a> He casts out the demons through the prince of the demons", verse 34.<a name=189:15></a> Another passage in chapter 12:24 is almost identical and alludes to the judgment of God upon any one speaking against the Spirit of God.<a name=189:16></a> The presence of the Spirit of God is the leading

		J.T.<a name=210:1></a> The brethren will all be aware that we have been considering the kingdom of God, and we have now come to our last session on this subject.<a name=210:2></a> We have been engaged with the kingdom of God generally, in its abstract character, but it is thought that we should review this chapter because it treats of the kingdom in a somewhat mixed character; so that we have the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens.<a name=210:3></a> Perhaps, if we keep our minds on this term, we may have a clearer view than we have had.<a name=210:4></a> The chapter furnishes instruction as to the present form of the kingdom; not the abstract form that we have been engaged with.<a name=210:5></a> The mixed condition that has arisen is presented in this chapter in seven parables.<a name=210:6></a> The closing section, verses 51 and 52, show how the truth in the chapter works out in believers who are regarded by the Lord as discipled into the kingdom of the heavens.<a name=210:7></a> One such is like a householder who brings out of his treasure things new and old.<a name=210:8></a> So that believers are thus furnished, as to the kingdom, with what is new first; namely.<a name=210:9></a> New Testament scriptures, or truth; and then, with what is old, namely.<a name=210:10></a> Old Testament scriptures.<a name=210:11></a> This is a matter of first importance for us because of the complicated conditions that have arisen in Christendom.<a name=210:12></a> We need to be discipled into the kingdom of the heavens; taught as pupils, so as to learn things as they are, with care and attention and with accuracy.<a name=210:13></a>

		A point of importance to notice is that in 1 Samuel, in approaching the truth as to David, the history of king Saul is recorded first to show how successful he was, although the spiritual eye can see that he failed, even at the outset, in not finding the asses.<a name=363:6></a> He failed in other incidents also, but particularly in the charge given to him to overthrow the Amalekites.<a name=363:7></a> He did overthrow them, but in doing so he disobeyed the word of Jehovah and failed in the most manifest way.<a name=363:8></a> He was told to destroy the Amalekites and all that they had, but instead of that he saved the best of the cattle and king Agag himself.<a name=363:9></a> He spared them because it was a question of the best, and it refers to nature's best being spared.<a name=363:10></a> And so a solemn word has to be said as to him by Samuel in chapter 15:10, "And the word of Jehovah came to Samuel, saying.<a name=363:11></a> It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king; for he is turned away from following me, and hath not fulfilled my words.<a name=363:12></a> And Samuel was much grieved; and he cried to Jehovah all night".<a name=363:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=382:1></a> We have read from the first chapter of 2 Chronicles and it is proposed that we should proceed further in our consideration of the history of Solomon, particularly as it is recorded in 1 Kings.<a name=382:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am sure the reading of the Scriptures has been heard with pleasure, and I hope, instruction, too, but it seemed impossible to avoid the reading of this number of passages, considering the nature and extent of Solomon's reign.<a name=382:3></a> It was thought that the last scripture read, which records the visit of the queen of Sheba, was needful so that we might have in our minds the effect of Solomon's administration on the gentiles, the queen being representative of them.<a name=382:4></a> We have Solomon's request for wisdom at the beginning of 2 Chronicles, and there is also the recording of his multiplication of horses, silver and wives, all of which were forbidden in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#17:16">Deuteronomy  17:16</a>,17.<a name=382:5></a> These forbidden things were the seeds of Solomon's downfall, and therefore they are intended to affect us now, that in the service of God we should see to it that we avoid what would become seeds of trouble and damage.<a name=382:6></a> The book of Kings especially mentions that there were forty thousand stalls of horses.<a name=382:7></a> Then there was a great quantity of silver, and besides this he multiplied wives, as remarked, all of which were forbidden, and proved peculiarly damaging to the king and his rule.<a name=382:8></a> On the other hand, the account in Chronicles is peculiarly attractive, because it has a certain touch that may be regarded as derived from the fact that Ezra had to do with writing the books of Chronicles.<a name=382:9></a> He was a man of peculiar interest in the testimony of God.<a name=382:10></a> We have the allusion to the house immediately, in chapter 2, where Solomon purposed to build a house for the name of Jehovah.<a name=382:11></a> "And Solomon purposed to build a house

		J.T.<a name=383:6></a> Well, I think he was a servant whom God used to link up the testimony from the outset.<a name=383:7></a> Chronicles begins with the name <i>Adam</i>; and then at the end, there is a link between 2 Chronicles and the book of Ezra.<a name=383:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=383:12></a> That is what I was thinking and it is important to take note of this.<a name=383:13></a> It is intended that we should be intelligent as to these things, and the links that bind Scripture together as one whole.<a name=383:14></a> Chronicles, Luke's gospel and the book of Acts form a great continuance of thought throughout the Scriptures in a historical way ending in Paul's position in Rome.<a name=383:15></a> You feel that it is fitting that there should be a link between Ezra and Paul; and accordingly, between the books of Chronicles and the book of Acts.<a name=383:16></a> Luke, who is the author of the Acts and the gospel that bears his name, was a man who carried the thought of thorough sympathy with the testimony in what he wrote.<a name=383:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=383:22></a> Yes; it is a very fine thought that Paul "received all who came to him".<a name=383:23></a> It must have entailed great labour to see people as they came to him, he having so much to do, because he must have written a large proportion of the epistles in the prison at Rome.<a name=383:24></a> We

	<div class="paragraph">
		I thought that before we entered on the positive side, which is presented in Kings, we would do well to note the failure; the king's transgression of <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#17">Deuteronomy  17</a>.<a name=384:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=384:9></a> There are special things mentioned through Moses, by the Spirit of God, that are prohibited to the king, and he should pay attention to them, whereas, they are the very things that Solomon ignored.<a name=384:10></a>

		J.T.<a name=384:13></a> Well, we must make allowance for the war horse, because he is a useful horse.<a name=384:14></a> You need to take up the battles of the testimony even in a care meeting.<a name=384:15></a> He smells the battle afar off, we are told -- "the thunder of the captains, and the shouting".<a name=384:16></a> I mean to say, he represents that side in a person who does not shirk the responsibility of war if needed.<a name=384:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=384:22></a> Apparently.<a name=384:23></a> It would be disregard of what the Scripture prohibits in a servant's way and relations.<a name=384:24></a> Surely it is taken notice of in heaven, for it is so manifest that these things were forbidden.<a name=384:25></a> But then we are immediately ushered into the glory that marked Solomon's reign and the great results, in the sense of building; because building is the great feature of his reign.<a name=384:26></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=385:10></a> But if we go to <a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#4">1 Kings  4</a>we see the public side of Solomon's reign in the sense of benefit for the people, and what order marked his reign.<a name=385:11></a> He was king over all Israel; and then his princes and their names are given, verses 2 - 6.<a name=385:12></a> And Solomon "had twelve superintendents over all Israel; and they provided food for the king and his household: each man his month in the year had to make provision", verse 7.<a name=385:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then, "Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking and making merry.<a name=385:14></a> And Solomon ruled over all kingdoms from the river to the land of the Philistines, and as far as the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.<a name=385:15></a> And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and sixty measures of meal, ten fatted oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and a hundred sheep, besides harts, and gazelles, and fallow deer, and fatted fowl.<a name=385:16></a> For he had dominion over all on this side the river, from Tiphsah as far as Gazah, over all the kings on this side the river; and he had peace on all sides round about.<a name=385:17></a> And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon", verses 20 - 25.<a name=385:18></a> There seems to be a remarkable link between him and his people and he has favour with God, so that he affords a foreshadowing of Christ in a very peculiar and special way.<a name=385:19></a> At the same time he prefigures what should be seen in our own services.<a name=385:20></a> Those who serve should be moving in happy relations with each other and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=386:9></a> One has often thought of "the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, in each month yielding its fruit".<a name=386:10></a> The leaves are for the healing of the nations, but the fruit of the tree of life is for the heavenly saints, showing how we rise in the New Testament to the celestial side of things.<a name=386:11></a> I think Solomon, in Chronicles, is a figure of the earthly side of assembly conditions; but 1 Kings would treat of his administration more in relation to heaven, typically.<a name=386:12></a> He built the house of God and his own house, and the other houses that are so great and varied, including the house of the forest of Lebanon.<a name=386:13></a> These would all point to the magnificence of the present time as seen in the assembly in its heavenly relations, but Chronicles would, I believe, point to the service of God maintained on earth, because we have the veil instead of folding doors.<a name=386:14></a> Solomon as a type also refers to the millennial glory of Christ in the future.<a name=386:15></a>

		J.T.<a name=387:13></a> Well, it is; of course there is hardly time to touch on it because the subject is so large.<a name=387:14></a> The intent today is that we each may take it on ourselves, and look into it as we have time for it.<a name=387:15></a> We can only touch on things in the merest way, now.<a name=387:16></a>

		And so these thoughts link up peculiarly with the passage in Genesis, for Jacob is seen as directly under orders from above; that is, from his father, who is representative of God.<a name=400:3></a> He is under orders to procure a wife.<a name=400:4></a> That is the principle.<a name=400:5></a> In this case he is to go to find her.<a name=400:6></a> The servant of Abraham was to go and find a wife for Isaac.<a name=400:7></a> He, too, was under orders -- explicit orders from Abraham as to the wife he was to procure.<a name=400:8></a> But here Jacob is to go himself.<a name=400:9></a> It is said, in Hosea: "Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep".<a name=400:10></a> The names used there are: <i>Jacob fled</i>, and <i>Israel served</i>.<a name=400:11></a> Jacob fled!<a name=400:12></a> That is a state of things that is not to be overlooked, for he was in danger of his life from his brother.<a name=400:13></a> Jacob is the responsible man.<a name=400:14></a> But the name is changed.<a name=400:15></a> Israel is the man who has become spiritual, "for thou hast wrestled with God, and with men, and hast prevailed".<a name=400:16></a> So it says, "Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep".<a name=400:17></a> So that there is nothing unseemly or unmanly in keeping sheep for a wife.<a name=400:18></a> It was Israel; he who had triumphed, acquiring power with God and men.<a name=400:19></a> He could well afford to humble himself in order to find a wife.<a name=400:20></a> In truth he hired himself to obtain her; but he was under orders.<a name=400:21></a> And that is just the point.<a name=400:22></a> We are not to exercise our own wills.<a name=400:23></a> If we do there will be trouble.<a name=400:24></a> Thus we have in the New Testament the word governing marriage, that it is only in the Lord (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#7:39">1 Corinthians  7:39</a>).<a name=400:25></a> That means that all is under His orders and that the exercise of our wills is shut out.<a name=400:26></a>

		This chapter contains the basic facts relative to the times of the gentiles.<a name=404:5></a> What is before us now is that we might understand and learn the facts relative to the transfer of government from Israel to the gentiles.<a name=404:6></a> It is obvious that the great kingdom of Israel had degenerated, and that its rulers had failed.<a name=404:7></a> Hence God was obliged to hide His face from the house of Israel, so to speak, and to transfer the authority of rule in the world to the gentile nations.<a name=404:8></a> The Spirit of God would impress us with the sorrow that necessarily entered into these circumstances, especially as felt by Daniel and his companions.<a name=404:9></a> And so Jerusalem ceased to be the centre of government.<a name=404:10></a> It was transferred to Babylon, and later to the Persians, and later still to the Greeks, and then finally to the Romans where it is now.<a name=404:11></a> There could be nothing in a way more important than that we should understand these facts and see what part we have in them.<a name=404:12></a> Daniel and his companions afford the idea of a remnant of those who would adhere to the mind of God and carry the testimony through in a humble and almost secret way, such as exists at the present time and in which we have part.<a name=404:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=427:1></a> The subject of administration has been pursued in the Old Testament for several months and it is thought that we should consider it now in the New Testament.<a name=427:2></a> It is thought that Paul's epistle to the Ephesians should be considered.<a name=427:3></a> It may be thought that the level of Ephesians is somewhat high for the first reading in the New Testament, but the principle governing it requires that we should begin at the top, for administration refers to what is at the top.<a name=427:4></a> It is therefore a question of Christ in heaven, being "head over all things to the assembly, which is his body, the fulness of him who fills all in all", chapter 1:22,23.<a name=427:5></a> Earlier in the chapter we have the exact word which has entered into all these meetings: ".<a name=427:6></a>.<a name=427:7></a>.<a name=427:8></a> having made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in himself for the <i>administration</i> of the fulness of times, to head up all, things in the Christ, the things in the heavens and the I things upon the earth", verses 9, 10.<a name=427:9></a> The word is also used twice in chapter 3.<a name=427:10></a> The subject, therefore, has a prominent place in this epistle.<a name=427:11></a> It should be noted that Paul, to whom was committed the great subject of the mystery of the gospel, as well as other leading subjects of the truth, resided and ministered three years in Ephesus and unfolded the truth in its fulness.<a name=427:12></a> He said he had not "shrunk from announcing to them all the counsel of God", (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20:27">Acts  20:27</a>).<a name=427:13></a> He spent three years at Ephesus and eighteen months at Corinth, which is the fundamental side of the position, but added to these he spent a good many years in prison.<a name=427:14></a> He was about two years in prison in Caesarea and probably more in Rome.<a name=427:15></a> It is thought that these years of imprisonment were ordered of the Lord to give the apostle an opportunity to be in quietness and in freedom from his ordinary active

		It is morally right that we should bear all these things in mind in considering the subject of administration.<a name=428:6></a> We read of the Lord having gone beyond all the heavens, but in the subject before us He is at the right hand of God, as we are told in verse 20: ".<a name=428:7></a>.<a name=428:8></a>.<a name=428:9></a> and he set him down at his right hand in the heavenlies, above every principality, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name named".<a name=428:10></a> He is actually administering now in the whole realm of the testimony.<a name=428:11></a> So that we have the Lord before us functioning as the great Administrator of the whole realm of the truth.<a name=428:12></a> It was thought, therefore, that we should direct our view to this epistle as well as to the verses we have read from <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#19">Acts  19</a>, which give the historical facts of the apostle's ministry in Ephesus.<a name=428:13></a> Chapter 20 is engaged with other features, but particularly calls attention to the apostle's work and how he summoned the elders of Ephesus to him to review the whole matter of his service amongst them and to exhort them to shepherd the assembly of God.<a name=428:14></a> We now get the benefit of all that.<a name=428:15></a> Administration extended all through the past centuries and will go on through Christianity, but it will also extend through the millennium and beyond it, for the assembly will be engaged in the service of administration throughout the eternal day.<a name=428:16></a> The assembly is made to grow into a holy temple
