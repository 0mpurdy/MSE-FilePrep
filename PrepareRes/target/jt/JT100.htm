		LIVING WITH CHRIST

		<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#20:4">Revelation  20:4</a>; <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:11">2 Timothy  2:11</a>, 12
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:1></a> The thought is to consider living with Christ.<a name=1:2></a> It says, "They lived and reigned with the Christ", living and reigning.<a name=1:3></a> In the passage in 2 Timothy we have how the living is reached, "For if we have died together with him, we shall also live together"; and how the reigning is reached: "If we endure, we shall also reign together".<a name=1:4></a> The dying is in view of living, and the enduring in view of reigning.<a name=1:5></a> The word 'endure' points to experience of a peculiar kind, and we are told in the note that it has a double sense in English, 'to last', and 'to go through suffering patiently'; it is the latter here.<a name=1:6></a> Reigning will thus apply to those who have endured down here.<a name=1:7></a> The hope is that while these passages have a prophetic bearing they may also have a practical, experimental bearing for us as we realise that if we are to administer in a governing sense, we must first learn how to live, to live with Christ, and then how to reign, to reign in the sense of influence and government in the assembly.<a name=1:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.R.<a name=1:9></a> Are the things set out in these scriptures a reward for being faithful here?<a name=1:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:11></a> Well, it is put that way: "They lived and reigned with the Christ".<a name=1:12></a> But what precedes that is, "And I saw thrones; and they sat upon them, and judgment was given to them; and the souls of those beheaded on account of the testimony of Jesus, and on account of the word of God; and those who had not done homage to the beast nor to his image, and had not received the mark on their forehead and hand; and they lived and reigned with the Christ a thousand years", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#20:4">Revelation  20:4</a>.<a name=1:13></a> It is clearly put in the sense of reward, that they are worthy of this honour.<a name=1:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.R.<a name=1:15></a> The overcomer in Smyrna is given a crown of life.<a name=1:16></a> Would that be a reward?<a name=1:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:1></a> The word is, "Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give to thee the crown of life" (chapter 2: 10).<a name=2:2></a> The lesson to us would be that what we go on with now in time in a moral way fits us to enter on official dignity; that is viewed or conferred as a reward.<a name=2:3></a> The apostle says, "Henceforth the crown of righteousness is laid up for me, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will render to me in that day; but not only to me, but also to all who love his appearing" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#4:8">2 Timothy  4:8</a>); so we are not coming into anything in this respect that is not already known in some sense.<a name=2:4></a> There may be, and doubtless will be, some surprises to us, but what we are coming into is already known normally.<a name=2:5></a> Living and reigning are already known.<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:7></a> Would the mighty men of David's reign who were given places in the kingdom of Solomon correspond with this?<a name=2:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:9></a> I would think so.<a name=2:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=2:11></a> It says of one that he was afflicted in all that in which David was afflicted.<a name=2:12></a> That would be like suffering with Christ.<a name=2:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:14></a> Quite so; they had already experienced things with David that perhaps they could not have experienced fully with Solomon, but with Solomon they would be confirmed; and in the antitype, at least, we are in glory with Christ, glorified together with Him.<a name=2:15></a> There is a certain peacefulness with Solomon that the mighty men could not have had with David.<a name=2:16></a> The Lord says, "But ye are they who have persevered with me in my temptations", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22:28">Luke  22:28</a>.<a name=2:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=2:18></a>M.<a name=2:19></a> The second clause in verse 4 says, "They sat upon them, and judgment was given to them"; that is one sentence, and then the next sentence speaks of "the souls of those beheaded on account of the testimony".<a name=2:20></a> Would it be right to apply that first sentence to the saints in the present dispensation, and the second to those beheaded after we are gone?<a name=2:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:22></a> I think so; it is a classified position.<a name=2:23></a> "And

		I saw thrones"; that is a general position; "and they sat upon them, and judgment was given to them", that is a certain class; then "the souls of those beheaded .<a name=3:1></a>.<a name=3:2></a>.<a name=3:3></a>", that is another set or class but linked up with the former; then another group, "and those who had not done homage to the beast nor to his image, and had not received the mark on their fore head and hand".<a name=3:4></a> It looks as if the Spirit has put them down here in a classified way, but all as one whole on the thrones.<a name=3:5></a> Some come in later.<a name=3:6></a> The first set would include, I understand, this present time.<a name=3:7></a> But it is the living and the reigning that is in mind to be stressed, how we are to learn to live so that we are not surprised, having already known something of it, when we come into the fulness of living and reigning with Christ.<a name=3:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.A.<a name=3:9></a>T.<a name=3:10></a> Are these the same ones that are mentioned in the end of verse 6, "they shall be priests of God and of the Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years"?<a name=3:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:12></a> It goes on to say in verse 5, "The rest of the dead did not live till the thousand years had been completed.<a name=3:13></a> This is the first resurrection".<a name=3:14></a> That all fits in with what we have just read.<a name=3:15></a> And then, "Blessed and holy he who has part in the first resurrection: over these the second death has no power; but they shall be priests of God and of the Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years".<a name=3:16></a> This is a further statement governing the previous passage, that is verses 4 and 5.<a name=3:17></a> I would say they are the same general class only they are said to be priests, priests of God and of the Christ; not simply priests unto God but of God, as if it is a sort of office they have, not simply a priestly service Godward, but priests of God and of the Christ as a general position of service.<a name=3:18></a> It may extend in help to others in the millennium.<a name=3:19></a> In chapter 1 it is that He has "made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father".<a name=3:20></a>

		F.S.<a name=4:1></a>C.<a name=4:2></a> Would it show here that not all those in the first resurrection are raised simultaneously?<a name=4:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:4></a> Well, that is a wonderful thing.<a name=4:5></a> It is all classed as one thing, indeed it is all one thing, but it is clear from the facts stated that it begins with ourselves according to 1 Thessalonians, although according to Matthew it had already begun as a testimony after the Lord rose from the dead.<a name=4:6></a> "Many bodies of the saints fallen asleep arose, and going out of the tombs after his arising, entered into the holy city and appeared unto many", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#27:52">Matthew  27:52</a>, 53.<a name=4:7></a> They had part in the first resurrection although they had part in it hundreds of years before ourselves.<a name=4:8></a> Then there are those who are raised according to <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#4">1 Thessalonians  4</a>, including, I suppose, all the sleeping saints up to that time.<a name=4:9></a> But then others will die through persecutions, as we learn here; they will be beheaded: "The souls of those beheaded on account of the testimony of Jesus, and on account of the word of God; and those who had not done homage to the beast nor to his image, and had not received the mark on their forehead and hand".<a name=4:10></a> These come in literally later, however short the time, but it is all one thing, nevertheless.<a name=4:11></a> The first resurrection covers them all.<a name=4:12></a> The rest of the dead are held in abeyance for one thousand years; they do not come into the liberty and glory of resurrection.<a name=4:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.R.<a name=4:14></a> Will those that die be greater than those that go through the persecution?<a name=4:15></a> They will be reigning with Christ in that sense.<a name=4:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:17></a> They have all part in the first resurrection.<a name=4:18></a> Of course there are those who are quickened; they do not die at all.<a name=4:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.R.<a name=4:20></a> Would quickening in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2">Ephesians  2</a>help us to know how to live?<a name=4:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:22></a> We will refer to that scripture: "You, being dead in your offences and sins .<a name=4:23></a>.<a name=4:24></a>.<a name=4:25></a> God, being rich in

		mercy, .<a name=5:1></a>.<a name=5:2></a>.<a name=5:3></a> (we too being dead in offences,) has quickened us with the Christ, (ye are saved by grace,) and has raised us up together, and has made us sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus".<a name=5:4></a> Your thought is that the quickening here and the raising enter into the idea of living with Christ?<a name=5:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.R.<a name=5:6></a> Yes; living now.<a name=5:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:8></a> Just so.<a name=5:9></a> We have also a passage in 1 Thessalonians: "Our Lord Jesus Christ, who has died for us, that whether we may be watching or sleep, we may live together with him" (chapter 5:9, 10).<a name=5:10></a> So that it is a strong thought in the Scriptures.<a name=5:11></a> Colossians has it too: "You .<a name=5:12></a>.<a name=5:13></a>.<a name=5:14></a> he has quickened together with him"; and then there is this side of the position in 2 Timothy, that dying precedes the idea of living; I think the passage really amplifies that in Revelation, "The word is faithful; for if we have died together with him, we shall also live together"; it is not only that we are "dead in trespasses and sins", as in Ephesians, but we do it as an act of our own, dying with Him having a moral force to it.<a name=5:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.W.<a name=5:16></a>M.<a name=5:17></a> Is that the meaning in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>"For if we are become identified with him in the likeness of his death, so also we shall be of His resurrection"?<a name=5:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:19></a> That is the same thought.<a name=5:20></a> We have the word 'if' in these various scriptures.<a name=5:21></a> "Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him".<a name=5:22></a> "If", so that it is a sort of hypothesis for us to face.<a name=5:23></a> It is open to us to die and the question is whether we have taken it up.<a name=5:24></a> "The word is faithful; for if we have died together with him .<a name=5:25></a>.<a name=5:26></a>.<a name=5:27></a>".<a name=5:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a state reached.<a name=5:29></a> We have reached that.<a name=5:30></a> "If we have died"-that is our side; it is our action.<a name=5:31></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=5:32></a>M.<a name=5:33></a> It would not be merely the solution of the moral question, but that we are going to enter into life because Christ has died, and that we pass through

	<div class="paragraph">
		death to do it.<a name=6:1></a> It is a sort of moral necessity, but there is also the idea of affection for Christ.<a name=6:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:3></a> Quite so, "Where thou diest, will I die".<a name=6:4></a> It is your action.<a name=6:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.N.<a name=6:6></a> Would it be right to say that life is involved in the idea of being beheaded on account of the testimony of Jesus, and in not doing homage to the beast, and so on?<a name=6:7></a> Would the kind of life they lived necessitate these things?<a name=6:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:9></a> Yes; they are honoured because in time they have stood out against the evil even unto death, because beheading is a very positive idea of death.<a name=6:10></a> The allusion would be, I suppose, to antichrist or the man of sin, getting rid of them, getting rid of persons like that who had such intelligence.<a name=6:11></a> Beheading is to remove the intelligence that would be in the enemy's way.<a name=6:12></a> We know that Goliath was beheaded.<a name=6:13></a> It alludes to Satan's resentment of any whom God has used in intelligence in the testimony.<a name=6:14></a> Such a man knows what he is doing and he is, dying for it.<a name=6:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.W.<a name=6:16></a>M.<a name=6:17></a> It is important to see that the 'if' is connected with identification with Him in the likeness of His death, but it says, "So also we shall be of his resurrection".<a name=6:18></a> There is no 'if' about the latter statement.<a name=6:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:20></a> The 'if' is what you have taken on, whether you have died with Him deliberately, because the idea of dying of yourself is very strongly pronounced in the Scriptures.<a name=6:21></a> We have learned to lay down our lives.<a name=6:22></a> We lay down our lives for the brethren as He has laid down His life for us.<a name=6:23></a> But here it is, "If we have died together with him".<a name=6:24></a> The "together", I suppose, would allude to us and Christ.<a name=6:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.R.<a name=6:26></a> Paul says, "I die daily".<a name=6:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:28></a> That shows how he used the commodity of death.<a name=6:29></a> He tells us elsewhere that death is ours.<a name=6:30></a> But what good is it if we do not use it?<a name=6:31></a> So that David says of Goliath's sword, "There is none like that".<a name=6:32></a>

		It is the kind of sword to use; that is, it is real death; but it is not to be wrapped up behind the ephod, it is to be used.<a name=7:1></a> David said he could use it, and in the government of God he was forced to use it, but he knew what its value was.<a name=7:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.W.<a name=7:3></a>S.<a name=7:4></a> Do the 'if' here and the several 'ifs' in Colossians suggest that there may not be many who are prepared to go this way?<a name=7:5></a> "Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:8">Romans  6:8</a>.<a name=7:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:7></a> It is open to us.<a name=7:8></a> It would have no force at all unless the opportunity of dying is open to us.<a name=7:9></a> In that scripture in Colossians it is already done, "If ye have died".<a name=7:10></a> That is already done, so that we are in that status, that class of people who have reached a point through dying.<a name=7:11></a> And then we go on into living with Christ, so that it is not a new thing; it will be no surprise that we have such distinction, because we have already gone through the process.<a name=7:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.H.<a name=7:13></a>L.<a name=7:14></a> Is the practical working out of it seen in "Always bearing about in the body the dying of Jesus", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:10">2 Corinthians  4:10</a>?<a name=7:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:16></a> Quite so; it would be that kind of thing, the dying of Jesus.<a name=7:17></a> It is not simply to see Him as dead, as in <a href="../bible/John.htm#6">John  6</a>, as food, but He is dying.<a name=7:18></a> It is the dying of Jesus, "that the life also of Jesus may be manifested".<a name=7:19></a> That is the way it works out.<a name=7:20></a>

		J.T.<a name=7:24></a> I think it is; that is, putting to death the body of sin.<a name=7:25></a> It is something that is deserving of that at your hands; is that what you mean?<a name=7:26></a> It deserves it at your hands because you know the thing you are dealing with, how provocative it is and how obnoxious to God.<a name=7:27></a> It ought to be dealt with by your hands.<a name=7:28></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:7></a> They are very deserving of it!<a name=8:8></a> The word 'therefore' shows it is a sequential thing, the chapter begins with it: "If therefore ye have been raised with the Christ" (that refers to chapter 2), "seek the things which are above, where the Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God .<a name=8:9></a>.<a name=8:10></a>.<a name=8:11></a> .<a name=8:12></a> Put to death therefore your members which are upon the earth", that is, the moral features of the natural in us that we are well aware of in their character and offensiveness to God, and in the damage they do.<a name=8:13></a> There ought to be no hesitation about it; there is even a certain amount of happiness in doing it according to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#137">Psalm  137</a>; even the little ones of Babylon are put to death.<a name=8:14></a> It is a sort of pleasure, if one may use the word, to terminate the thing that is so awful, that is so disturbing, so objectionable to God.<a name=8:15></a>

		C.A.<a name=9:12></a>M.<a name=9:13></a> I was thinking of Jacob somewhat in that connection.<a name=9:14></a> It says in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#49:28">Genesis  49:28</a>, 29, "Every one according to his blessing he blessed them.<a name=9:15></a> And he charged them, and said to them, I am gathered to my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave".<a name=9:16></a> He must have faced an immensity in that as he thought of all those sons.<a name=9:17></a> Was he not stressing to them the necessity of burial, the great meaning there was in it?<a name=9:18></a> There was a history really that went into burial.<a name=9:19></a>

		J.T.<a name=9:20></a> He wanted to be buried himself and to be buried in a certain place, where resurrection would take place; so that we can well afford to accept burial in view of resurrection, "For if we are become identified with him in the likeness of his death, so also we shall be of his resurrection".<a name=9:21></a> I am not sure that I would connect Jacob's instructions as to his burial with any evil-doing.<a name=9:22></a> What we are speaking of now in Colossians, the putting to death and the putting off, is dealing with evil-doing.<a name=9:23></a> But then there is such a thing as dying by the will of God in the light of resurrection, and there is nothing attached to that,

		The link one had in mind in reading these scriptures is the great thought of time.<a name=23:1></a> Abroad in the world, there is a great shortage of manpower, but this is governed by shortage of time; and shortage of time is evident in our gatherings, so that we are enjoined to redeem the time.<a name=23:2></a> One feels that considerable time is lost in our gatherings for want of readiness, for want of preparation.<a name=23:3></a> The first scripture contemplates that the Lord, when the hour was come, placed Himself at table, the twelve apostles with Him.<a name=23:4></a> "And when the hour was come, he placed himself at table, and the twelve apostles with him" (verse 14)- It is clear enough that there was no time lost.<a name=23:5></a> The Lord being on time, those who might join with Him administratively were also there.<a name=23:6></a> They are with Him.<a name=23:7></a> We are together with each other, and each is to function as opportunity affords, but the time is not to wait for us.<a name=23:8></a> So the hour was come, and what an hour it was!<a name=23:9></a> It could not but be the beginning of the hour, clearly.<a name=23:10></a> The scripture implies this, that the hour was there and that this is the very beginning of it.<a name=23:11></a> They did not have to remain idle.<a name=23:12></a> The Lord placed Himself, we are told.<a name=23:13></a> That was an action entering into the service.<a name=23:14></a>

		Himself at table.<a name=24:1></a> It was the passover, but it was a great matter involving these points which enter into what has come down to us, what belongs to assembly activity or service; so, dear brethren, what I am remarking cannot fail to have some effect upon us in regard to lateness and irregularity in assembly matters.<a name=24:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The assembly is the greatest thing in the universe outside of divine Persons.<a name=24:3></a> They are, of course, Persons, but the assembly is the greatest thing and has the first place in the universe; so that it is to be observed by those who are of it, and they will not fail to observe what belongs to it; so it should not be interfered with, for each person in it, included in it, is to function, and if we are absent or late, we fail; so, dear brethren, I need not enlarge on what I have said.<a name=24:4></a> These remarks have no hidden meaning, but they bear on us here particularly in this great city where there is considerable want of observation of what is proper to assembly order in service.<a name=24:5></a> So the Lord is in His place, and the twelve apostles are with Him.<a name=24:6></a> He selected them, and they were selected by Him in view of this very position, as were other disciples like them, in view of the greatest position in the whole universe.<a name=24:7></a> They were selected in view of that, and it is said they, the twelve apostles, were with Him.<a name=24:8></a> It is just the apostles, in the original, and the twelve are implied evidently, because even Judas is said to be there.<a name=24:9></a> They were with Him, and the hour, the functioning time had arrived; it arrived here some minutes ago, a good few minutes ago, and they wait for us.<a name=24:10></a> Others who were here on time had to wait, too, and maybe, I may say, the Lord had to wait, for we are not exactly in assembly as when we are assembled at the Supper, for He then comes to us as the bread is broken.<a name=24:11></a> Here we are more conscious that He is with us on the principle of where "two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them".<a name=24:12></a> So that an assembly position

		But now returning to our subject as to Matthew and John, we get John in this first chapter of Revelation in a peculiar and special way.<a name=44:1></a> We are told, "Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to shew to his bondmen what must shortly take place; and he signified it, sending by his angel, to his bondman John, who testified the word of God, and the testimony of Jesus Christ".<a name=44:2></a> John is here called a "bondman", and the angel is sent to him, and then we are told what he did: he "testified the word of God"; the word 'testified' here would mean the way in which he brought the word of God to bear in this book, "The testimony of Jesus Christ, all things that he saw".<a name=44:3></a> The Lord signified what He received from His Father, "sending by his angel, to his bondman John".<a name=44:4></a> That is, certain signs had been used to indicate the revelation to John who testified the word of God.<a name=44:5></a> It continues, "John to the seven assemblies which are in Asia: Grace to you and peace from him who is, and who was, and who is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne; and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth".<a name=44:6></a> This is John's address to the seven assemblies.<a name=44:7></a> Then he says, "To him who loves us, and has washed us from our sins in his blood, and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father: to him be the glory and the might to the ages of ages.<a name=44:8></a> Amen".<a name=44:9></a> That is what John says to the seven assemblies, what the Spirit of God is now saying.<a name=44:10></a> This introduction indicates what a servant he was, and the moral power he has to address the seven assemblies.<a name=44:11></a> Had he been in each of them?<a name=44:12></a> It would appear so.<a name=44:13></a> It would look as though he had some knowledge of them.<a name=44:14></a> He had not been used to form the assemblies; apparently that was Paul's work.<a name=44:15></a> But he evidently knew them and knew what to say; and what he says involves the peculiar character of this book, that the Lord "loves

		us, and has washed us from our sins in his blood, and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father".<a name=45:1></a> Then in verse 9 he tells us, "I John, your brother and fellow-partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and patience, in Jesus".<a name=45:2></a> What an experience he had had!<a name=45:3></a> a "fellow-partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and patience, in Jesus".<a name=45:4></a> These features, as the note tells us, 'are intimately connected, being brought together under one head by one article in the Greek'.<a name=45:5></a> John was a thoroughly balanced brother in his experience.<a name=45:6></a> The brethren will have noticed, no doubt, that these qualities, "tribulation", "kingdom" and "patience", are intimately connected; that is, the brother John is presented to us as marked by partaking in the tribulation and kingdom and patience in Jesus.<a name=45:7></a> The preposition used indicates being in these things in power, that is, he was affected by them.<a name=45:8></a> Then he goes on to say that he "was in the island called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus".<a name=45:9></a> He then says, "I became in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet".<a name=45:10></a> What he heard was about the assembly under seven heads.<a name=45:11></a> Then he says, "And I turned back to see the voice which spoke with me; and having turned, I saw seven golden lamps"; that is, he speaks of seeing the assembly before he saw Christ; "And in the midst of the seven lamps one like the Son of man".<a name=45:12></a> It is well to note what he sees, because it brings out the character of the work of the brother or minister; and then he is able to describe the Lord, not as by Himself, but in the midst of the seven golden lamps; that is to say, it is the Lord in relation to the assembly and it is an assembly man speaking about it with feeling.<a name=45:13></a> We can see the Lord is setting out the situation fully about the assemblies, and He is seen in their midst.<a name=45:14></a>

		THE ASSEMBLY AS SEEN IN THE REVELATION (2)

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=48:1></a> To complete the introduction to our subject a few remarks are required on verses 17 to 20 of the first chapter of Revelation.<a name=48:2></a> John says, "And when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead; and he laid his right hand upon me, saying, Fear not; I am the first and the last, and the living one: and I became dead, and behold, I am living to the ages of ages, and have the keys of death and of hades", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:17">Revelation  1:17</a>, 18.<a name=48:3></a> And then the Lord says, "Write therefore what thou hast seen, and the things that are, and the things that are about to be after these.<a name=48:4></a> The mystery of the seven stars which thou hast seen on my right hand, and the seven golden lamps.<a name=48:5></a> -- The seven stars are angels of the seven assemblies; and the seven lamps are seven assemblies".<a name=48:6></a> The adjustment that the servant needed is indicated here, an important matter as to service and those who are bondmen.<a name=48:7></a> John is affected by what he saw.<a name=48:8></a> The Lord brings certain facts before him with a view to his complete adjustment for the service.<a name=48:9></a> So He says, "Fear not; I am the first and the last, and the living one: and I became dead, and behold, I am living to the ages of ages, and have the keys of death and of hades".<a name=48:10></a> So that the Lord sets him up in view of the service He was committing to him and tells him the order in which he is to write, which is applicable in principle to what we say as well as to what we write, that is, the order in which we set out our subject matter.<a name=48:11></a> First, He says, "What thou hast seen", then "The things that are", and then "The things that are about to be after these".<a name=48:12></a> The order of the writing is made plain, as if the Spirit of God would have the truth ministered in a certain order

	<div class="paragraph">
		the order of one, two, three.<a name=49:1></a> And then there is this matter of the mystery (verse 20); if one is to be initiated into that, it would be number one.<a name=49:2></a> The seven stars are the angels of the assemblies, and the seven lamps are the seven assemblies, so that the servant is now set up in view of his service.<a name=49:3></a> The book bears in mind too, that as servants we are just creatures and liable to error or failure, even though commissioned.<a name=49:4></a> A very solemn thing!<a name=49:5></a> At the end of what he saw in chapter 22: 8, John says, "And when I heard and saw, I fell down to do homage before the feet of the angel who shewed me these things", showing how one may be mistaken in one's understanding and outlook even although commissioned and in actual service; therefore we are reminded that we are to be in constant dependence.<a name=49:6></a> Even in the exercise of our service we may begin well and get through well and yet finish ill.<a name=49:7></a> The book contemplates the perfect Servant, which Mark also presents, but it warns us of our creature limitations and creature liabilities, so at the end of chapter 1 John is set out on his service to write messages to the seven assemblies severally.<a name=49:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.H.<a name=49:9></a>H.<a name=49:10></a> Would this dependence be secured in the knowledge that the Lord holds the seven stars in His right hand?<a name=49:11></a> Would that be our security?<a name=49:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=49:13></a> That is a good suggestion.<a name=49:14></a> In the danger attaching to us it is establishing to know that we are held in the Lord's right hand.<a name=49:15></a> It says, "These things says he that holds the seven stars in his right hand"; it is not simply that they are under control, though He has them under control, but that He maintains them, too.<a name=49:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.H.<a name=49:17></a> How would the thought of His having the stars in His right hand fit in with decline in the assemblies?<a name=49:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=49:19></a> In the general position of man if the servant were upheld absolutely it would mean almost complete disregard of responsibility, that is, if he were held in

		immaculateness.<a name=50:1></a> The Pope, for instance, is held to be infallible under certain circumstances; that is, if he takes a certain attitude.<a name=50:2></a> He does not assume to be infallible absolutely; it is only under certain circumstances.<a name=50:3></a> But that is going beyond creature liabilities, because a creature is liable to fail at any time; although there is the side, for instance, of the inspiration of the Scriptures which is infallible.<a name=50:4></a> Then too in the ministry of certain persons like the apostles, servants have been preserved; yet there is in all of them the evidence of liability to fail, for "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#1:8">1 John  1:8</a>.<a name=50:5></a> We shall be in a state of perfection ultimately, and that is what God has in mind, that abstractly the saints are in a state of perfection now because Scripture says, "We know that every one begotten of God does not sin", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:18">1 John  5:18</a>.<a name=50:6></a> But that is abstract, assuming what will be, and what can be in a certain relation even now; but whilst we are in a state of flesh and blood there is no guarantee against failure, even though it be only in a small sense.<a name=50:7></a> Yet the holding of the seven stars implies that that is the general position of the dispensation; the Lord has taken up this attitude of holding.<a name=50:8></a> Later, in chapter 3, He says that He has the seven stars "These things saith he that has the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars" (verse 1).<a name=50:9></a> The word 'has' there is not 'holds'.<a name=50:10></a> Holding them is more active and definite.<a name=50:11></a> Having them is just the fact of possession, and I suppose when we come to the conditions of Sardis there will even be the suggestion that ministry is not being preserved and supported.<a name=50:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.J.<a name=50:13></a>H.<a name=50:14></a> Is it a good indication that at the start, having seen the Lord in this way, John falls at His feet as dead?<a name=50:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=50:16></a> The Lord does not reprove it, but He says to John, "Fear not".<a name=50:17></a> You could hardly think of John in his ordinary service as taking up this attitude.<a name=50:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think while it is not reproved exactly, yet it is a little out of accord with the position of the servant as set up in the Spirit.<a name=51:1></a> In fact he says he was "in the Spirit", "I became in the Spirit on the Lord's day".<a name=51:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.J.<a name=51:3></a>H.<a name=51:4></a> I wondered if it was in the presence of what is judicial.<a name=51:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=51:6></a> Quite; I would not like to say much, but the Lord says, "Fear not", which might be interpreted that he might be justified in fearing; but really I think the Lord meant there was nothing to fear.<a name=51:7></a> He intended that John should know Him.<a name=51:8></a> John's own gospel shows how the truth of life works out, as the Lord says to Martha, "I am the resurrection and the life: he that believes on me, though he have died, shall live; and every one who lives and believes on me shall never die", <a href="../bible/John.htm#11:25">John  11:25</a>, 26.<a name=51:9></a> I mean to say, the truth of life in Christ implies that there is really nothing to fear; the full apprehension of the truth would lead to that.<a name=51:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.H.<a name=51:11></a>H.<a name=51:12></a> Is it an essential thing in the servant to feel his weakness in the presence of this?<a name=51:13></a> David says in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#39:4">Psalm  39:4</a>, "Make me to know, Jehovah, mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is: I shall know how frail I am".<a name=51:14></a> Would that be a wholesome exercise?<a name=51:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=51:16></a> Well, you get illustrations of commendable lowly attitudes.<a name=51:17></a> Daniel, for instance, was very weak in the presence of the angel or minister from God; he describes his gradual recovery and finally he is made to stand by the angel, who says, "Fear not, Daniel".<a name=51:18></a> Later he says, "Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me", <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#10:19">Daniel  10:19</a>.<a name=51:19></a> But christianity certainly supposes a perfect condition, that is, that on the principle of life in Christ one is made perfect.<a name=51:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.J.<a name=51:21></a>H.<a name=51:22></a> And the knowledge that "perfect love casts out fear", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:18">1 John  4:18</a>.<a name=51:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=51:24></a> Quite so, and chapter 1:7 of the same epistle says, "But if we walk in the light as he is in

		the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from all sin".<a name=52:1></a> It is admitted that we are weak, but we know the priesthood of Christ preserves us.<a name=52:2></a> At the same time christianity involves what is perfect, abstractly anyway.<a name=52:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.A.<a name=52:4></a>T.<a name=52:5></a> Would you make a distinction in your mind between John's failure and that of Barnabas and Mark, in that the two latter acted in self-will?<a name=52:6></a> They did not go on with Paul in the service.<a name=52:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=52:8></a> At the juncture you refer to Barnabas and Mark were morally wrong.<a name=52:9></a> They were acting somewhat on partisan lines.<a name=52:10></a> But that is not the same as a brother like John in the presence of such a vision.<a name=52:11></a> You may say you cannot wonder at his being affected.<a name=52:12></a> It is true you cannot attach any wrong moral element to John here; at the same time the question is whether he is in the full sense of what christianity implies.<a name=52:13></a> Abraham had a vision and he was not in this state, and others too had visions.<a name=52:14></a> But John is recording what happened to him and the Lord said, "Fear not".<a name=52:15></a> It is therefore for us to judge, and I would say that the full thought of christianity should have supported him.<a name=52:16></a> The Lord intended to support him in the presence of the vision.<a name=52:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.H.<a name=52:18></a>H.<a name=52:19></a> Would Mary's attitude in the presence of the angel be a good example?<a name=52:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=52:21></a> Quite so; she was not abashed at all.<a name=52:22></a> That is a good illustration.<a name=52:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.H.<a name=52:24></a> John had never seen the Lord in this attitude before.<a name=52:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=52:26></a> Did he not see Him when He took a whip of small cords and drove the sheep-dealers out of the temple?<a name=52:27></a> What would he have seen in the Lord then?<a name=52:28></a> He would have been in similar garb then, would He not?<a name=52:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		<a name=53>[Page 53]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=53:1></a> Quite so; at the same time christianity is involved, it implies a perfect state.<a name=53:2></a> John knew what it was to be in the power that is available to the believer; he says, "I became in the Spirit on the Lord's day".<a name=53:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.H.<a name=53:4></a>H.<a name=53:5></a> So he would have seen the Lord in both aspects: on the mount of transfiguration he would have seen Him as glorified, and then as acting judicially in the temple.<a name=53:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=53:7></a> Just so; the Lord would have been seen by the apostles in many ways, so that in some sense this garb would have been seen in His dealing with evil, and with good too.<a name=53:8></a> It is very beautiful, as if the Lord would say to John, There is nothing to cause you fear.<a name=53:9></a> There was much to cause others to fear in their delinquencies that He was about to speak of; He spoke only to make them fear, but I think the Lord meant that for John there was nothing to fear.<a name=53:10></a> Surely christianity implies that!<a name=53:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.B.<a name=53:12></a> Is there a suggestion of all that in Daniel, where it is one like to the appearance of a man who touches him and says, "Fear not"?<a name=53:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=53:14></a> Just so, Daniel had a similar experience, as we have already noted.<a name=53:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.H.<a name=53:16></a>H.<a name=53:17></a> It would link on with the angel's words, "Fear not ye, for I know that ye seek Jesus the crucified one", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28:5">Matthew  28:5</a>.<a name=53:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.H.<a name=53:19></a> Is the thought in your mind that we need not fear in seeking to go on with the testimony in these days?<a name=53:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=53:21></a> That is what we should gather.<a name=53:22></a> The Lord knows how to approve and He knows how to disapprove.<a name=53:23></a> If a person is not going on well and comes into the Lord's presence, the Lord would not say to him, There is nothing to fear!<a name=53:24></a> But with John it was different, he was going on well.<a name=53:25></a> In fact the description he gives of himself would show he was fully in accord with the truth.<a name=53:26></a>

		M.W.<a name=54:1></a>A.<a name=54:2></a> John himself says in his epistle that "perfect love casts out fear; for fear has torment, and he that fears has not been made perfect in love".<a name=54:3></a> Does that have a bearing?<a name=54:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=54:5></a> It does indeed.<a name=54:6></a> I think God would perfect the apostle in all that christianity means.<a name=54:7></a> Christianity is absolutely perfect in the abstract; when we can eliminate all else we have an absolutely perfect thing; and the Holy Spirit is capable of maintaining us now in that abstract state.<a name=54:8></a>

		R.H.<a name=54:9></a> Is there a link between the emphatic "I" here and the "I" in the end of Matthew?<a name=54:10></a> "And behold, I am with you all the days, until the completion of the age", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28:20">Matthew  28:20</a>.<a name=54:11></a> Would the perfection of the position you are speaking of be linked with that?<a name=54:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=54:13></a> You have the emphatic "I" here, you mean, in verse 17.<a name=54:14></a> Quite so; "I am the first and the last, and the living one: and I became dead, and behold, I am living to the ages of ages, and have the keys of death and of hades".<a name=54:15></a> That comes in after He says, "Fear not".<a name=54:16></a> All that is really to emphasise the idea that there is nothing to fear at all in John's case.<a name=54:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.J.<a name=54:18></a>H.<a name=54:19></a> Is there a suggestion that if any one will take up these issues which the Lord is taking up with the seven assemblies, the Lord will hold him in His right hand and support him?<a name=54:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=54:21></a> I think that is His attitude, the attitude of holding the seven stars, and any one under commission should be strengthened by it.<a name=54:22></a> John is actually under commission and the Lord is saying to him, There is nothing in this position to fear.<a name=54:23></a> It will not do if I am capable of cowering before anything; if I am under commission I must be strong, as was said to Joshua, "Only be strong and very courageous", <a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#1:7">Joshua  1:7</a>.<a name=54:24></a> So when the man with the drawn sword appeared to him he did not cower, but he said, "Art thou for us, or for our enemies?<a name=54:25></a>", <a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#5:13">Joshua  5:13</a>.<a name=54:26></a> He carried on the partisan idea in the presence of the Lord and the

		J.T.<a name=76:1></a> The address to the assembly at Thyatira must be included in what comes before us at this time, beginning with verse 18 of chapter 2.<a name=76:2></a> That address was read yesterday afternoon but not touched in our remarks, so that we have four assemblies to consider now.<a name=76:3></a> We shall have to be more or less brief in our remarks so that all may be covered.<a name=76:4></a> The assemblies especially before us now are Thyatira and Philadelphia.<a name=76:5></a> The errors in Thyatira may be counteracted by the virtues indicated in Philadelphia, for the two assemblies run together; they are prophetically contemporary.<a name=76:6></a> There is a peculiar kind of responsibility attached to angels in Thyatira, as indicated in what is said to the angel there.<a name=76:7></a> The Lord says, "But I have against thee that thou permittest the woman Jezebel, she who calls herself prophetess, and she teaches and leads astray my servants", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2:20">Revelation  2:20</a>.<a name=76:8></a> The brethren no doubt have noticed that the word 'woman' may be translated 'wife', so that we are reminded of a household situation in Thyatira, in which there is the wife and the one who is responsible in regard of her.<a name=76:9></a> Her conduct is terrible, but still it is a household situation that is in mind.<a name=76:10></a> It shows what christendom has become, a sort of administration contemplating a household, and the responsible element, that is, the angel, is neglectful.<a name=76:11></a> The Lord says, "Thou permittest the woman Jezebel", as if her husband were ignoring the officious conduct of his wife.<a name=76:12></a> He knew it, he was there and responsible, but he failed to check it, to have it corrected.<a name=76:13></a> He permitted it, the allusion being, as the teaching shows, to the situation in the reign of Ahab in which Elijah ministered.<a name=76:14></a> It was a

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=78:21></a> It is well to bring that up.<a name=78:22></a> It is said, "She teaches and leads astray my servants"; and then we are told in verse 24, "But to you I say, the rest" (that is, the remnant) "who are in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine .<a name=78:23></a>.<a name=78:24></a>.<a name=78:25></a>".<a name=78:26></a> The allusion is to what she teaches, so that we have to watch the feminine power rising, attempting to teach in the profession and acquiring pre-eminence above the masculine feature.<a name=78:27></a> That is what has developed in Rome, because this paragraph in chapter 2 is early in the history of

		"What thou hast seen, and the things that are, and the things that are about to be after these".<a name=104:3></a> The assembly is, of course, the same, whether in the early or the closing chapters of the book, only that it is the heavenly side in these latter chapters.<a name=104:4></a> The first passage read involves more the moral side of the assembly; it records what has been, that is, the righteousnesses of the saints.<a name=104:5></a> These are in mind as seen here: the clothing in which the Lamb's wife is arrayed.<a name=104:6></a> But in order to have a clear view we should perhaps look a little at the earlier part of the chapter which tells of the judgment of the corrupted professing system.<a name=104:7></a> We noted earlier that, in chapter 2, "the woman Jezebel" may be rendered, 'the wife Jezebel', involving a household situation; whereas the view we get of her in the end of the book, in chapters 17, 18 and the early verses of 19, involves more what is political, the idea of her relation with the responsible element.<a name=104:8></a> It is said in chapter 16: "And the great city was divided into three parts; and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon was remembered before God to give her the cup of the wine of the fury of his wrath".<a name=104:9></a>

		Then verses 15 to 18 say, "And he says to me, The waters which thou sawest, where the harlot sits, are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues.<a name=106:1></a> And the ten horns which thou sawest, and the beast, these shall hate the harlot, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and shall burn her with fire; for God has given to their hearts to do his mind, and to act with one mind, and to give their kingdom to the beast until the words of God shall be fulfilled.<a name=106:2></a> And the woman which thou sawest is the great city, which has kingship over the kings of the earth".<a name=106:3></a> Then chapter 18 is her destruction and the beginning of chapter 19 is the celebration of the event "After these things I heard as a loud voice of a great multitude in the heaven, saying, Hallelujah: the salvation and the glory and the power of our God for true and righteous are his judgments; for he has judged the great harlot which corrupted the earth with her fornication, and has avenged the blood of his bondmen at her hand.<a name=106:4></a> And a second time they said, Hallelujah.<a name=106:5></a> And her smoke goes up to the ages of ages.<a name=106:6></a> And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and did homage to God who sits upon the throne, saying, Amen, Hallelujah.<a name=106:7></a> And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his bondmen, and ye that fear him, small and great".<a name=106:8></a> I thought we should have these facts before us, dear brethren, in considering the assembly in its heavenly relations, and how the wisdom of God and the righteousness of God require that the false assembly or church should be destroyed, and destroyed in such a way that the bearing of her destruction is eternal; it goes on for ever and ever.<a name=106:9></a>

		The twenty-four elders refer to what He has in experience, companionship with Himself; so the precedence of the living creatures would mean that they are properly subordinate to the elders but the elders wait until they make a move.<a name=110:1></a> In chapter 4 it says, "And the four living creatures, each one of them having respectively six wings; round and within they are full of eyes; and they cease not day and night saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is to come.<a name=110:2></a> And when the living creatures shall give glory and honour and thanksgiving to him that sits upon the throne, who lives to the ages of ages, the twenty-four elders shall fall before him that sits upon the throne, and do homage to him that lives to the ages of ages; and shall cast their crowns before the throne, saying, Thou art worthy, O our Lord and our God, to receive glory and honour and power; for thou hast created all things, and for thy will they were, and they have been created".<a name=110:3></a> That is, the elders have precedence because they have intelligence as being with God and coming down, as it were, through David; representing the best of the old dispensation.<a name=110:4></a> They include this dispensation too.<a name=110:5></a> So that when the living creatures give glory and thanksgiving, it is said the twenty-four elders shall fall before Him.<a name=110:6></a> They act consequent upon the action of the living creatures, as if to give fulness to what they do.<a name=110:7></a> There is, therefore, in the ways of God the principle of grade throughout, and the twenty-four elders represent the most exalted grade in the sense of intelligence in the government of God.<a name=110:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=111:7></a> That seems to be the position in the introduction here in this remarkable way in chapter 4.<a name=111:8></a> The matter comes down through David, because the reference really is to David's regime in the great stress on the number twenty-four and the different offices and functions mentioned.<a name=111:9></a> It would seem as if David's part in this last book of the Bible, as we call it, is to stress excellence and grade.<a name=111:10></a> The word 'grade' is a good one, I think, in the government and ways of God, and the elders represent the highest grade.<a name=111:11></a> The book of Psalms should be connected with the Pentateuch, which is the historical working out of the creation, and of the position of Israel in the government of God.<a name=111:12></a> The nations were all arranged in relation to Israel; they were bound to stand in relation to Israel; and David comes in in that setting in the book of Psalms, which expresses the highest order of intelligence and feeling and spirituality in the Old Testament.<a name=111:13></a> The highest order of intelligence in all the dispensations is represented there, of course involving experience

		with God, because the Psalms are expressions of experience with God.<a name=112:1></a> Hence I would think that David's part in this book is to convey supreme excellence and special experience with God; as though the wealth that He has coming down with Him through the ages is now enthroned and crowned in relation to Him-because it is God's throne; that is in mind in chapter 4, and it is God that is celebrated here.<a name=112:2></a> Then again we have in verse 6 of the passage we read, "I heard as a voice .<a name=112:3></a>.<a name=112:4></a>.<a name=112:5></a> saying, Hallelujah"; so that God is in view here and then the Lamb.<a name=112:6></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=127:2></a> Of course it is only spoken of negatively; that is, it involves the positive.<a name=127:3></a> There is no sin there, which is a comforting thing.<a name=127:4></a> In fact it almost fits with certain things that are said here: "He shall wipe away every tear from their eyes"; well, that suggests that there has been sin which caused the tears.<a name=127:5></a> "And death shall not exist any more", that is another negative, but it is only a negative to assert a positive.<a name=127:6></a> "For the former things have passed away".<a name=127:7></a> I think that hymn is quite in order; it is precious anyway, as confirming us, because we do not forget that we are still in the body.<a name=127:8></a> We are in the body in all our service, we can never assume that we are out of it.<a name=127:9></a> Paul says he did not know whether he was in the body or out of it, but we can never say we are out of the body.<a name=127:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=127:17></a> Yes; the whole passage is of that character.<a name=127:18></a> God says, "He that overcomes shall inherit these things, and I will be to him God, and he shall be to me son.<a name=127:19></a> But to the fearful and unbelieving, and sinners, and those who make themselves abominable, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, their part is in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone; which is the second death".<a name=127:20></a> So that it seems that these verses are for us at the present time as confirmatory, and comforting us in a negative way.<a name=127:21></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=128:10></a> Yes.<a name=128:11></a> So what comes in between chapter 19 and this passage involves the complete clearance of the universe from sin.<a name=128:12></a> The whole matter of sin is dealt with and settled in the lake of fire.<a name=128:13></a> The very thought of the lake of fire is admitted: they shall have their part in the lake which burns.<a name=128:14></a> It is the eternal judgment of sin which enters into this matter, the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is "the second death".<a name=128:15></a> That hymn is quite in keeping with the language we use in the divine service, because we are still here and we value the thought of eternal judgment, that is, the final settlement of things which are causing so many tears and so much sorrow.<a name=128:16></a>

		The need of purification is especially in mind in the epistle to Titus, for his ministry tells us in chapter 3 what we might call the modus operandi of salvation "But when the kindness and love to man of our Saviour God appeared, not on the principle of works which have been done in righteousness which we had done, but according to his own mercy he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, which he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Saviour"; for the gospel is in mind in the epistle, the whole thoughts of the gospel.<a name=191:1></a> Full thoughts are in mind.<a name=191:2></a> No question now of new birth but of what is needed for salvation.<a name=191:3></a> So what lies alongside the truth of salvation which is in mind, is the idea of eternal life, as an adjunct to what we are saved by.<a name=191:4></a> It involves eternal life, not that eternal life is presented here in the epistle as we hope to look into in the next reading, in what it is in itself essentially, but as part of the gospel.<a name=191:5></a> And it is therefore the elements of the glad tidings which are in mind in Titus.<a name=191:6></a> So it is said, "But when the kindness and love to man of our Saviour God appeared, not on the principle of works which have been done in righteousness which we had done, but according to his own mercy he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, which he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Saviour; that, having been justified by his grace, we should become heirs according to the hope of eternal life".<a name=191:7></a> So that in reading these sections the hope is that we may learn, in what may come before us, the truth of the gospel involving the need of purification and purity.<a name=191:8></a>

		We have been speaking today, dear brethren, of the movement characteristic of christianity beginning with the idea of entering the kingdom of God and what I have in mind in these four scriptures is those who have entered and are moving with God, each knowing that he is a part of the kingdom: "Made us a kingdom", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:6">Revelation  1:6</a>.<a name=282:1></a> It really synchronises with the kingdom of God, but it has its own distinctiveness and implies that each is not only known in the kingdom and under protection, but is part of it, part of the great system of government and movement and activity in which God has part as well as ourselves, a living system, a system of persons; the Lord spoke of one who was evidently moving apart not far from the kingdom.<a name=282:2></a> When one comes nigh movement is there, but in that well-known case the movement was not allowed to become effective.<a name=282:3></a> But to come to the personnel of these scriptures, the first is Rachel, one who is deserving of being regarded as a mother in Israel, and it is because of this that she is under review now.<a name=282:4></a> She had asked for a child, a son evidently, for it is said, "And God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her", showing that she had acquired a place in God's mind.<a name=282:5></a> Now in saying all this I had thought of opening up a little a family matter, a household matter: my thought is to be very simple and practical; this matter of a family and all that enters into it has a great place with God.<a name=282:6></a> We see here a mother, or one who would be one, and becomes one, not a foster-mother, she was a foster-mother already, but she was to become a real mother with a real son.<a name=282:7></a> And she had acquired a place in God's mind, not in any great

		Now in order to qualify further what I have said, I quote what the writer in the previous chapter says, "This also have I seen as wisdom under the sun, and it was great unto me.<a name=308:9></a> There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and encompassed it, and built great bulwarks against it: and there was found in it a poor wise man, who by his wisdom delivered the city; but no man remembered that poor man".<a name=308:10></a> Well now, this is the city, and in it the Lord Jesus was found, because the Lord Jesus is really depicted here as the "poor wise man".<a name=308:11></a> He built the city, but it takes a long story to show that He delivers the city.<a name=308:12></a> I am not going to tell that story, but simply to say that the Lord Jesus is in mind here, and most of us remember Him in the Supper, but many do not.<a name=308:13></a> It says in verse 15, "But

		Now as I said it is a moral thought, and has to be apprehended in a moral sense, and if you want to get into it, it involves judgment of this world that you have fallen into, and maybe that you have been damaged by its influence.<a name=309:11></a> You may like it because of what it gives to young people, to make them, as they think, wise, but this wonderful system that the Lord Jesus has is for your deliverance.<a name=309:12></a> He has built it, and He has it for the moment for you.<a name=309:13></a> Presently He will have it for Himself eternally.<a name=309:14></a> He has it for Himself now, but it is also a vessel of deliverance for every person who wants it.<a name=309:15></a> Perhaps you are a believer in the Lord Jesus, but the question of the world is not settled in your soul.<a name=309:16></a> You do not know the way into "the city".<a name=309:17></a> You weary yourself.<a name=309:18></a> You say, I would like to be back with the people of God, but somehow I cannot find the way, as this verse says, "The labour of fools wearieth them, because they know not how to go to the city".<a name=309:19></a> You would have no difficulty if you wanted

		Now, as I was saying, the poor man, who typifies the Lord Jesus, has delivered the city, and if He is not in your mind, the Holy Spirit intends that He should be in your mind, if you are a christian; and if you are not, He should still be in your mind, because you may be among those who <i>are to be saved</i>, "those that were to be saved", meaning that God has you in His purpose, and you choose to stay out, to remain in the world, or at times you want to come back to your place with the lovers of Jesus in the things that relate to salvation.<a name=310:11></a> Now I am speaking very plainly, I hope, to every young person here.<a name=310:12></a> It is a great opportunity for you to lend your ear carefully to what has been said, and see if you cannot find your feet in the way.<a name=310:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=318:1></a> What is in mind particularly is that we might all see that the assembly is the custodian of the interests of Christ.<a name=318:2></a> We see in chapter 18 how it has a final word as to differences among the brethren.<a name=318:3></a> The interests of the Lord are not at the disposal of any nation or accumulation of nations, nor dominated by any person on earth.<a name=318:4></a> The assembly is constituted to take charge.<a name=318:5></a> Matthew has this in mind, the Lord saying in Matthew's gospel that He is with us always even to the end of the age, not exactly to do things for us but that we should do them ourselves according to the light and ability He gives us, but He is with us, and so if any acute situation arises He is with the two or three gathered unto His name.<a name=318:6></a> I think the point that is important is, that drawing near to this section of this gospel of Matthew, dealing with the assembly and with the revelation made as to it and as to the Lord Jesus, we have stressed the idea of faith.<a name=318:7></a> That is, what we are dealing with is a faith matter, not simply a visible matter such as would appear in relation to any human matter or organisation.<a name=318:8></a> It is a faith matter, and so we have such statements as the Lord's remark to Peter as having attempted to walk on the water, "O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?<a name=318:9></a>".<a name=318:10></a> His faith was little.<a name=318:11></a> Then again we have the Syrophenician woman of whom the Lord says, "Great is thy faith", and there are such statements which bear upon the passage in the gospel.<a name=318:12></a> Thus we are dealing with a faith situation, a faith system.<a name=318:13></a> Christ is above, He is not visible to the natural eye.<a name=318:14></a> It is said, "Whom heaven indeed must receive till the times of the restoring of all things"

		from the provinces came: "There came Jews from Antioch and Iconium, and having persuaded the crowds and stoned Paul, drew him out of the city, supposing him to have died".<a name=356:1></a> Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up and came to the city, and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.<a name=356:2></a> That is to say the Lord, in effect, said, 'My service must go on, be the wickedness of the nations what it may, its violence what it may, the measures taken to murder him what they may, the service must go on'; and it went on the next day.<a name=356:3></a> And so we do well, dear brethren, to learn to have the servants in our hearts, in our affections, understanding what they suffer; if they do not suffer, there is something amiss, something awry, because suffering is the order of the day, according to the Lord's own words, "I will shew to him how much he must suffer for my name", and it worked out, according to the epistle of the Colossians.<a name=356:4></a> It is a peculiar epistle in this sense, because it says so much about Paul's service, about his suffering and about the kind of service too, what functions he filled in the service of Christ, as if each one of us is to go to school, as it were to him.<a name=356:5></a> I mentioned the word 'school' because it was he that separated the saints into the school of Tyrannus.<a name=356:6></a> There was no uncertain meaning, for the Lord would teach us, would impress upon us the necessity of learning, and learning well, not simply as it suits us, but learning well, and so he directed the disciples to the school of Tyrannus, in which school he kept on teaching.<a name=356:7></a> Both he and Barnabas had been teaching in another school at Antioch, where the disciples were first called christians, as if they earned the name in that school.<a name=356:8></a> They taught, we are told, in the assembly, a large crowd.<a name=356:9></a> These words are to be noted; they were there for a whole year, showing the length of time the servants were there in certain circumstances.<a name=356:10></a> They began with the crowd, that is

		raw material; the material was woven, as it were, and fitted until it became an assembly, so that you can visualise what had happened at Antioch, when the building was first formed of raw material, uneducated spiritually, but gradually the crowd itself and the name became the assembly, as if I was speaking to five hundred people here.<a name=357:1></a> First we begin with raw material, indeed, the term is quite applicable, because so many are uneducated (spiritually I mean).<a name=357:2></a> We may be highly educated otherwise and not spiritually educated.<a name=357:3></a> The fact is, the more highly educated we are the less likely we are to be spiritually educated.<a name=357:4></a> Not that I make little of it, but it is not necessary to make much of ourselves as individuals in this world, because we are being fitted for heaven, another world, for that world and the resurrection, and we want to see that we are fitted for it now.<a name=357:5></a> And so individuals cease to be one of the crowd, and begin to be one of the assembly, and that is what I am aiming at, that the brethren may understand that Paul was a great assembly man, and that he laboured to that end, as he says, "Until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at the full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ".<a name=357:6></a> Then he says that we should no longer be babes, that is no longer raw material but finished material, finished for the assembly.<a name=357:7></a> Hence Paul says again, "That we may present every man perfect in Christ".<a name=357:8></a> That is not impossible for women.<a name=357:9></a> The divine idea is that we should be perfect.<a name=357:10></a> 'Perfect' has its own meaning, and we have to understand that, for every man is to be presented perfect in Christ.<a name=357:11></a> Not simply perfect in the ordinary sense, but in Christ Jesus, and Paul laboured to that end; he suffered for it, and was carried out as dead.<a name=357:12></a> Think of the suffering the brethren had to go through.<a name=357:13></a>

		and fellow-partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and patience, in Jesus, was in the island called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus".<a name=358:1></a> Now this is John, and he testified the great theme of the book of Revelation.<a name=358:2></a> The book of Revelation is said to be given to Christ: "which God gave to him".<a name=358:3></a> The "Revelation of Jesus Christ", and it says that it was sent to His bondman "to shew .<a name=358:4></a>.<a name=358:5></a>.<a name=358:6></a> what must shortly take place; and he signified it, sending by his angel, to his bondman John, who testified the word of God, and the testimony of Jesus Christ, all things that he saw".<a name=358:7></a> I should add the next verse, "Blessed is he that reads, and they that hear the words of the prophecy, and keep the things written in it; for the time is near".<a name=358:8></a> That is to say keep, not only read, but keep the things that are written therein.<a name=358:9></a> Not only to know the things that are written therein, but to keep them.<a name=358:10></a> Now John says here, addressing himself to them, "I John", he says, "your brother and fellow-partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and patience, in Jesus".<a name=358:11></a> That is to say he is calling upon us, assuming that we are in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ.<a name=358:12></a> He is in that kingdom; the Lord is considering for him.<a name=358:13></a> He is one of the twelve, and apparently intended to be one of the last to go to heaven, as far as we can see.<a name=358:14></a> The Lord said to Peter, "If I will that he abide until I come, what is that to thee?<a name=358:15></a>".<a name=358:16></a> And so it would appear from that that he lived to be a very old brother; apparently his service was not impaired by his age, and so we are not to assume that because a brother is getting old (he is apt to be called old too often), his ministry is on the wane and apt to be weakened; and that he is about to be superannuated.<a name=358:17></a> There is no such word in the divine vocabulary as that.<a name=358:18></a> There is very much of it found among official circles of the world, but certainly not in the divine vocabulary.<a name=358:19></a> A brother is to go on and on to his last breath, and the Lord may say, 'I will make that one longer than the

		J.T.<a name=432:1></a> It is hoped that something may come before us for profit as to John, especially the family of God, as calling for concern for each other; all is in mind in the assembly, which God has designed to work out His thoughts of love; that is, in effect, that we should seek each other's good and promote love amongst ourselves, and promote what would be a means under God's hand for working out His thoughts.<a name=432:2></a> That is the order of the assembly, because God has not given up any thought of His since Pentecost, and the assembly was designed to afford Him a means to work out His thoughts.<a name=432:3></a> His thoughts have a wide bearing leading up to eternity.<a name=432:4></a> John has this in mind peculiarly; he speaks of the work of Christ and the things which He did.<a name=432:5></a> "If they were written one by one, I suppose that not even the world itself would contain the books written", <a href="../bible/John.htm#21:25">John  21:25</a>.<a name=432:6></a>

		Despite these facts there were certain conditions that the enemy could use, and was using, conditions of ease, and the neglect of the things of God (verse 2).<a name=445:5></a> There was neglect of the rights of God in His house, what belongs to Him, as the assembly is His.<a name=445:6></a> It is God's assembly, and the Holy Spirit is here in it, but He can be hindered by conditions.<a name=445:7></a> We shall see as we proceed how God was ready to come in there, and is ready to do so now.<a name=445:8></a> Indeed, not only will God come in, but He has come in.<a name=445:9></a> We have proved it week after week for years, but we want more, more spiritual power.<a name=445:10></a>

		We get, for instance, in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#6">Isaiah  6</a>, the term 'seraphim' and in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#3">Genesis  3</a>we get reference to the 'cherubim'.<a name=452:9></a> Now I would ask the brethren to consider whether or not these are creatures.<a name=452:10></a> My own impression is that they are not.<a name=452:11></a> And to this end the inquiry comes up at once whether there are unnamed divine Persons.<a name=452:12></a> I am speaking soberly and I believe the brethren will listen and think of what I am saying.<a name=452:13></a> Are there any unnamed divine Persons?<a name=452:14></a> I am sure that there are none and, as far as I can see from Scripture, there are none.<a name=452:15></a>

		Now the question comes up as to these terms that are mentioned.<a name=453:2></a> The word 'cherubim' is in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#3">Genesis  3</a>.<a name=453:3></a> The cherubim were set to protect the tree of life, "to guard the way to the tree of life".<a name=453:4></a> The tree of life in the garden was a tree, it is not a person.<a name=453:5></a> Eternal life is not a person itself.<a name=453:6></a> Some have thought that it is.<a name=453:7></a> It is a term, a term of blessing that we have come into, one of the greatest blessings that we have, but it is not as great as what is to be reached in the assembly.<a name=453:8></a> The assembly is the greatest of all divine concepts.<a name=453:9></a> The assembly is not a divine Person, it is a creature, however much we may regard it and however great the statements that are made as to it, and I give one citation.<a name=453:10></a> The assembly is said to be "the pillar and base of the truth", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3:15">1 Timothy  3:15</a>.<a name=453:11></a> Now it might be assumed that a vessel of which that is stated must be divine, but it is not divine; it is a creature.<a name=453:12></a> The fact is that eternal life is the name of a thing; "the eternal life, which was with the Father" is a thing.<a name=453:13></a> The Lord Jesus was with the Father, but He is a divine Person.<a name=453:14></a> But the thing itself is a thing; eternal life is a thing; but I do not continue to speak about eternal life, because that issue has been settled.<a name=453:15></a> But fifty years or so ago there were those who assumed and asserted definitely that eternal life was a person, and those who did not believe it were regarded as erroneous, but that is a thing of the past, thank God!<a name=453:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I come back to these symbolic names, for they are just symbols; that is to say, cherubim and seraphim are both symbolic names.<a name=453:17></a> The seraphim are mentioned in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#6">Isaiah  6</a>.<a name=453:18></a> The cherubim are first spoken of in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#3:24">Genesis  3:24</a>.<a name=453:19></a> It is remarkable that they are spoken of early.<a name=453:20></a> But no one can prove from Scripture that the word 'cherubim' speaks of a kind of person-not rightly.<a name=453:21></a> Scripture does not afford

		light that the word is other than a symbolic thing.<a name=454:1></a> It is used as a symbol, something that conveys a certain impression to the mind; it is a symbol.<a name=454:2></a> On the other hand angels are creatures, "Are they not all ministering spirits", it says, "sent out for service on account of those who shall inherit salvation?<a name=454:3></a>", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:14">Hebrews  1:14</a>.<a name=454:4></a> That is said about angels.<a name=454:5></a> Angels are not put over the age to come.<a name=454:6></a> The Son, the Lord Jesus is put over the age to come, the world to come of which we speak.<a name=454:7></a> That is a phrase from Scripture that F.<a name=454:8></a>E.<a name=454:9></a>R.<a name=454:10></a> used frequently and helped the brethren as to it.<a name=454:11></a> But angels were created long before man was created.<a name=454:12></a> Man's creation is recorded in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:26">Genesis  1:26</a>.<a name=454:13></a> In <a href="../bible/Job.htm#38:7">Job  38:7</a> we are told that the sons of God shouted for joy at the founding of the earth.<a name=454:14></a> They are capable of joy.<a name=454:15></a> There may be a good many young people here tonight who probably have never thought of these things and I am hoping that they will get help to think over them and weigh the facts of Scripture.<a name=454:16></a>

		Now we might leave the subject of angels and seraphim and cherubim and come down to Abraham.<a name=454:17></a> What I have in mind is that Abraham is a good sample of a creature to be considered in comparison with divine Persons.<a name=454:18></a> The way divine Persons speak of Abraham is very remarkable.<a name=454:19></a> We have it clearly here in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#12">Genesis  12</a>.<a name=454:20></a> He was a most distinguished man, perhaps the most distinguished of any.<a name=454:21></a> Moses may have been equally distinguished, but I think that Abraham has peculiar distinction.<a name=454:22></a> He is the father of us all, it says-a remarkable thing that could be said of a creature.<a name=454:23></a>

		And so I come to Paul, and what he says in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#11:5">2 Corinthians  11:5</a>, is "I reckon that in nothing I am behind those who are in surpassing degree apostles".<a name=456:1></a> Now I suggest to the brethren that what Paul says there indicates that he is the most superior of all the apostles.<a name=456:2></a> There was none like him; and yet he failed; yet he is a creature.<a name=456:3></a> I think it is well that we should all have these facts in our minds so that we will be able to converse about them and speak about them and serve God in them.<a name=456:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I might have spoken about John who speaks of himself as the disciple whom Jesus loved.<a name=456:5></a> The Lord said to Peter, about John, "If I will that he abide until I come, what is that to thee?<a name=456:6></a>", <a href="../bible/John.htm#21:22">John  21:22</a>.<a name=456:7></a> The inference would be that the Lord would leave him here until He came, which would include the present moment.<a name=456:8></a> But the Lord did not say that.<a name=456:9></a> He said, "If I will that he abide until I come .<a name=456:10></a>.<a name=456:11></a>".<a name=456:12></a> Therefore John, the apostle, has gone to be with the Lord long since, the disciple whom Jesus loved.<a name=456:13></a> Yet he was not a divine Person.<a name=456:14></a> The Lord loved him, and implied, in a certain sense, that He might keep him as a reserve man, but He has not done so.<a name=456:15></a> The Lord is getting on with what He has here on earth today.<a name=456:16></a> Some of us are kept here for that purpose and we can thank God that we are here today to edify one another.<a name=456:17></a> And we can say that the Lord loves us, too.<a name=456:18></a> It is a great privilege to be loved by the Lord.<a name=456:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But further as to Paul: he says, "I reckon that in nothing I am behind those who are in surpassing degree apostles".<a name=456:20></a> The footnote in some of our Bibles says that this is an ironical allusion to those who were false apostles.<a name=456:21></a> But I think that is a mistake.<a name=456:22></a> The editor made a mistake there.<a name=456:23></a> The passage implies clearly that Paul was superior to any of the other apostles.<a name=456:24></a> He says in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:9">1 Corinthians  15:9</a> that he was not fit to be called an apostle because he persecuted the assembly, and he felt it.<a name=456:25></a>

		J.T.<a name=457:1></a> The sufferings of Christ are in mind.<a name=457:2></a> What especially is to be noted is the abandonment of the Lord Jesus, which is beyond words to describe by human mouth.<a name=457:3></a> There is no passage to be more thought of really, than the one we have read.<a name=457:4></a> "And when the sixth hour was come, there came darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour; and at the ninth hour, Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?<a name=457:5></a> which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?<a name=457:6></a> And some of those who stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calls for Elias.<a name=457:7></a> And one, running and filling a sponge with vinegar, fixed it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone, let us see if Elias comes to take him down.<a name=457:8></a> And Jesus, having uttered a loud cry, expired.<a name=457:9></a> And the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom".<a name=457:10></a> The immensity of the sufferings of Christ are seen here.<a name=457:11></a> We should think of it, perhaps, more than we ever have done before, for indeed they cannot be measured in human words.<a name=457:12></a> Only a divine Person could fully measure them.<a name=457:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=457:14></a> Would the fact that in the type the day of atonement is linked with the crown of the spiritual year, the seventh month, show that it is intended to have an effect on that side of the position as the saints come to the crown of the spiritual year?<a name=457:15></a> The seventh month was the climax of the festive months; the tenth day of the seventh month was the day of atonement.<a name=457:16></a> I thought it would show that the saints in the full joy of the climax of the spiritual year are to be affected by the sufferings of Christ from this viewpoint.<a name=457:17></a>

		directly from the Father or the Spirit; it is complete abandonment.<a name=458:1></a> "Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?<a name=458:2></a> which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why has thou forsaken me?<a name=458:3></a>".<a name=458:4></a> Notice the interpretation; it is not simply the ordinary language of the human race, but what is especially used in this matter.<a name=458:5></a> So, I repeat again this thought of abandonment, that God abandoned His beloved Son.<a name=458:6></a> "Some of those who stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calls for Elias".<a name=458:7></a> This is a mistake; it is wrong to say that He called for Elias.<a name=458:8></a> How erroneous, with the best of intentions, we may be as to the things of God.<a name=458:9></a> It is just as well that we have this before us because it is most important that we should be as accurate as we can be in dealing with the holy things of God.<a name=458:10></a>

		Ques.<a name=458:11></a> Would there be any time in the service of God where we would give expression to the sufferings in these verses?<a name=458:12></a> It has been said that we should not bring the atoning sufferings into the service.<a name=458:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=458:14></a> I would repeat what I said this morning, that I would hesitate to say that the sufferings of Christ should not be brought into the service.<a name=458:15></a>

		J.T.<a name=458:18></a> It was complete abandonment.<a name=458:19></a> The Lord Jesus went through it as Man.<a name=458:20></a> We are not able to convey what it was, it is only by the Spirit of God that we can consider it properly.<a name=458:21></a>

		J.T.<a name=460:15></a> That is quite so, but Paul was not abandoned.<a name=460:16></a>

		J.T.<a name=460:26></a> I think so, fully.<a name=460:27></a> All these things that we now are thinking of and stressing so much ought to be in our minds so that we can gain by this conversation.<a name=460:28></a>

		Ques.<a name=460:29></a> In connection with the sufferings, is there any thought as to the cry being in a loud voice?<a name=460:30></a>

		J.T.<a name=460:31></a> That is to give emphasis to it.<a name=460:32></a> The Lord was entitled to do that; He is a divine Person.<a name=460:33></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=461:7></a> That is exactly what I have in mind.<a name=461:8></a> Mark is very accurate and more explanatory in certain details than any of the other gospels, as far as I can see.<a name=461:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=461:10></a> Would the answer to this question, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?<a name=461:11></a>" be seen in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5">2 Corinthians  5</a>, "Him who knew not sin he has made sin for us"?<a name=461:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=461:16></a> When it is said, in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9">Hebrews  9</a>, that He offered Himself by the eternal Spirit, would that perhaps have a limited sense, up to this point, before the abandonment?<a name=461:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=461:18></a> I would not use the word 'limited'.<a name=461:19></a> I would be afraid of that.<a name=461:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=462:5></a> I would think, by comparison, that the allusion is to His death.<a name=462:6></a>

		Ques.<a name=462:7></a> What did you have in mind when you referred to "Behold, he calls for Elias"?<a name=462:8></a> Then it says, "Let alone, let us see if Elias comes to take him down".<a name=462:9></a> You referred to that as inaccuracy.<a name=462:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=462:27></a> All I would enlarge on in the last chapter is this tendency to unbelief.<a name=462:28></a> Let us read from verse 9 "Now when he had risen very early, the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary of Magdala, out of whom he had cast seven demons.<a name=462:29></a> She went and brought word to those that had been with him, who were grieving and weeping.<a name=462:30></a> And when these- heard
