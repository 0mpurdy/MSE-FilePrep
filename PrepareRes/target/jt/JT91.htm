		I wish to dwell a little on what is commonly called missionary service, which signifies the idea of one being sent.<a name=1:2></a> All Paul's missionary journeys imply that he was divinely sent.<a name=1:3></a> Persons may be sent by men, but we are concerned with work growing out of a divine commission; as Scripture says, "how shall they preach unless they have been sent?<a name=1:4></a>" <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#10:15">Romans  10:15</a>.<a name=1:5></a> Thus the inquiry, "Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?<a name=1:6></a>" <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#6:8">Isaiah  6:8</a>.<a name=1:7></a>

		Gifts, we read in Corinthians, are 'set' in the assembly.<a name=1:8></a> This, I apprehend, involves the right and means in God's hand of the control of His servants, which sometimes means restriction.<a name=1:9></a> God, in setting gifts in the assembly, has them under His hand, and no one who is with God in His service would wish it otherwise.<a name=1:10></a> To be set in the assembly is to be in that in which divine order is seen and where divine authority is recognised and asserted.<a name=1:11></a> This is an important matter, for the servant is given a commission with a definite end in view, and the saints, as we see in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13">Acts  13</a>, have part in this.<a name=1:12></a> There must be an objective, both as to where the potential results of the mission are to be found, and the results themselves as fully secured.<a name=1:13></a> For instance, if Solomon is to have gold the mariners are not to go to sea whither they will (<a href="../bible/2Chronicles.htm#8:17">2 Chronicles  8:17</a>,18), there is no such thought as that.<a name=1:14></a> They had a knowledge of the sea, but were necessarily under royal control.<a name=1:15></a> All the expenses would be borne by the king, whose right was obvious.<a name=1:16></a> And so it is, dear brethren, in the service of God; the field is His and He knows where the results He

		seeks are to be found.<a name=2:1></a> It is a matter of God's knowledge and direction.<a name=2:2></a> Going back into the history of the testimony we see that the government of God enters into everything.<a name=2:3></a> He has a perfect knowledge of the field in which He operates.<a name=2:4></a> He said of Corinth, "I have much people in this city".<a name=2:5></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#18:10">Acts  18:10</a>.<a name=2:6></a> The Lord bade the disciples to "cast their net on the right side of the ship" <a href="../bible/John.htm#21:6">John  21:6</a> -- that was where the fish were and the Lord knew it.<a name=2:7></a> Had they cast the net on the left side probably they would have caught no fish.<a name=2:8></a> So you see that the area for the desired result is known to the Lord; He knows where they are to be found.<a name=2:9></a> Divine movements in testimony in Paul's day were in a westerly direction; He seeks the assembly now; by and by He will seek for something else and will probably go east.<a name=2:10></a> What we see here is a movement westward and that by one who has prospered in the work and who is concerned about the assemblies already existing, that they should be confirmed; <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#15:41">Acts  15:41</a>; <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16:5">Acts  16:5</a>.<a name=2:11></a> Thus the assemblies were established in the faith and increased in number every day.<a name=2:12></a> This is surely an important side of the ministry.<a name=2:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish now to point out that in this happy service under the blessing of God, Paul and those with him not only came under the authority of the Lord, but the guidance of the Spirit.<a name=2:14></a> He speaks twice here in a forbidding way and I think it implies that a gift moving in the dignity of his commission is given to understand that the Holy Spirit is here in that connection.<a name=2:15></a> As set in the assembly the servant may come under the criticism of his brethren.<a name=2:16></a> In the epistles we get the principle of the saints judging, and that is an important matter.<a name=2:17></a> A servant has to expect the faithful counsel and criticism of his brethren.<a name=2:18></a> It is his salvation to do so; if he is not amenable to his brethren, he is in independency.<a name=2:19></a> Here, according to <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4">Ephesians  4</a>, Paul is in the liberty of one sent by an ascended Christ as provision for the assembly

		rather than one set in it.<a name=3:1></a> He is thus under the direct control of the Spirit.<a name=3:2></a> To respond to the Spirit requires a state of spiritual sensitiveness, so that one quickly <i>feels</i> His touch.<a name=3:3></a> Paul's motive was right and he was so sensitive that the Holy Spirit could denote that the regions he proposed to visit were not to be his sphere of labour at that time.<a name=3:4></a> He wrought in these places later and had great results, but for the moment the Spirit does not suffer him to go there.<a name=3:5></a> Still the Spirit does not tell the apostle and those with him where they are to go, but Paul has a vision.<a name=3:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"A vision appeared to Paul" (verse 9), and who was in the vision?<a name=3:7></a> A <i>man</i> of Macedonia.<a name=3:8></a> This man signifies the <i>potential</i> result.<a name=3:9></a> God is not occupying the apostle with man in the sense in which the Greeks represented man.<a name=3:10></a> The Greek world stood for human development.<a name=3:11></a> You have that man in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#2">Romans  2</a>in the instructed Greek.<a name=3:12></a> <i>That</i> man is not asking a despised disciple of Jesus to help him, he is resourceful on his own account.<a name=3:13></a> Paul says there, "O man"!<a name=3:14></a> and the Athenians say of him, "What would this chatterer say?<a name=3:15></a>" they mocked Paul.<a name=3:16></a> It is not that man which is in view here -- it is potentially a man according to God.<a name=3:17></a> Why should we go to Jamaica, or anywhere else, unless we had that man before us?<a name=3:18></a> There is "one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#2:5">1 Timothy  2:5</a> and the testimony is to bring about other men after His order.<a name=3:19></a> That is what we should have in view in our service.<a name=3:20></a> Paul heard a man's voice.<a name=3:21></a> There is suggested one in the intelligent sense of responsibility, but in felt need.<a name=3:22></a> It was intended to impress the minister as to need in the west, and it did impress him, for he proceeds to Macedonia, "assuredly gathering", Luke says, "that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them".<a name=3:23></a> Paul, as a true servant, takes a "straight course" (verse 11).<a name=3:24></a> There were no second thoughts, no selfish motives.<a name=3:25></a> It is a question of "assuredly gathering" that the Lord is calling him,

	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and answering immediately and definitely to that call.<a name=4:1></a> Then Luke comes in for the first time.<a name=4:2></a> On this line we may look for <i>divinely given companionship</i>.<a name=4:3></a> So we have "they" in verse 6 and "we" in verse 10.<a name=4:4></a> What an acquisition Luke must have been!<a name=4:5></a> He is in the company now.<a name=4:6></a> May we not hope that our dear brethren going forth from us will have some sort of companionship to encourage them in their service -- companionship in the spirit of service?<a name=4:7></a> The Lord Himself valued it, and Paul also valued it.<a name=4:8></a> From the manner of the apostle's reference to him later it is evident that Luke was sympathetic, and sympathy is a great thing in the service of God.<a name=4:9></a> Luke was a "beloved physician".<a name=4:10></a> <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#4:14">Colossians  4:14</a>.<a name=4:11></a> He was a dear man, being heartily with the apostle.<a name=4:12></a> How he would minister to Paul and Silas in their physical sufferings!<a name=4:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then what follows is that the apostle and his companions, having arrived at Philippi, "were in that city abiding certain days".<a name=4:14></a> That is another thing.<a name=4:15></a> To arrive in a place is one thing, to <i>remain</i> there is another.<a name=4:16></a> They found something of God there.<a name=4:17></a> "And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted thither".<a name=4:18></a> A fine position!<a name=4:19></a> They were only women, but they were <i>praying</i> women.<a name=4:20></a> "Where prayer was wont to be made".<a name=4:21></a> The servants of Christ identified themselves with what was of God there.<a name=4:22></a> It is a fine thing, as finding something of God in a place, to ally ourselves with it.<a name=4:23></a> We honour God as thus recognising His work, however small it may seem.<a name=4:24></a> Nothing is inaugurated as yet at Philippi.<a name=4:25></a> And now the enemy attacks through a woman.<a name=4:26></a> It is a sorrowful matter that the enemy has a foothold there.<a name=4:27></a> He does not limit his attack to Paul -- "followed Paul and <i>us</i>".<a name=4:28></a> Luke puts Paul forward as the special object of attack, but he and the others with Paul were not excluded, for the enemy attacks as

		widely as possible.<a name=5:1></a> She says, "These men are the servants of the most high God".<a name=5:2></a> It was an attempt at flattery, and diversion from the present character of the testimony, which if accepted means ruin.<a name=5:3></a> Many a servant of God has been damaged, if not ruined, through this kind of opposition.<a name=5:4></a> The Scriptures put us on our guard against it.<a name=5:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would dwell briefly on the manner of meeting this attack.<a name=5:6></a> Paul was "grieved" -- if we do not <i>feel</i> such things as before God, He may allow them to continue.<a name=5:7></a> Here the attack was for "many days, But Paul being <i>grieved</i> .<a name=5:8></a>.<a name=5:9></a>.<a name=5:10></a>".<a name=5:11></a> 'What is there in me that this thing should continue?<a name=5:12></a>' he would perhaps say.<a name=5:13></a> It was most harassing, as from a female slave possessed with a spirit of Python.<a name=5:14></a> Why does God allow these dear men to be followed day by day?<a name=5:15></a> Do you not think Paul challenged his own heart as to this effort of Satan?<a name=5:16></a> I am sure he did.<a name=5:17></a> It is as we <i>feel</i> things that God comes in.<a name=5:18></a> All the consequences have to be accepted and anything upon which God may wish to put His finger owned.<a name=5:19></a> Paul's deep feelings about this matter brought in divine help.<a name=5:20></a> By the power of the Spirit he says to the demon, "I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.<a name=5:21></a> And he came out the same hour".<a name=5:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I trust these remarks will be comforting to our dear brethren as they set out on their service.<a name=5:23></a> Paul was confirmed in his course by the results at Philippi.<a name=5:24></a> The 'man' was there; the Philippian epistle denotes from the divine viewpoint the man whom God had in His mind.<a name=5:25></a> The mind that is in Christ Jesus was reflected in the Philippian saints, and Paul wrote to perfect them in Him.<a name=5:26></a> Paul met with most severe suffering and imprisonment at Philippi, but in the prison he found a man -- the jailer -- who, as believing on the Lord Jesus, showed by the treatment he accorded to His servants that he had drunk into His Spirit.<a name=5:27></a>

		THE REMNANT
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#51:18">Isaiah  51:18</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am thinking, dear brethren, of the remnant.<a name=6:1></a> It is a leading subject in this book.<a name=6:2></a> You will all remember how that in chapter 7 the prophet is directed to meet Ahaz with his son Shear-jashub at the aqueduct on the highway of the fuller's field.<a name=6:3></a> Shear-jashub signifies, "A remnant shall return".<a name=6:4></a> In a large measure this is the key to this book.<a name=6:5></a> So that, applying it to our own times, and it <i>does</i> apply, the question is, Am I of that remnant?<a name=6:6></a> The remnant may be very small and despised, but when Sennacherib attacked it under Hezekiah, the virgin daughter of Zion is alluded to as 'unconquered', <a href="../bible/2Kings.htm#19:21">2 Kings  19:21</a>, (see note).<a name=6:7></a> So that it is a great honour to be in that remnant, and no believer in Christ can afford to be apart from it.<a name=6:8></a> It is unconquerable -- corresponding in large measure to the first epistle of John, in which we are told that, "This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith" <a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:4">1 John  5:4</a> -- that which true, devoted followers of Christ hold on the principle of faith.<a name=6:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In speaking of the remnant, I wish to bring in what is in this chapter prominently -- the idea of father and mother.<a name=6:10></a> You will observe that as following righteousness and seeking the Lord the saints are reminded of the 'rock' whence they were hewn, and of the 'pit' whence they were digged.<a name=6:11></a> The reference to hewing and digging is remarkable, the one not involving anything less honourable than the other, for they both allude to the great parents of the household of faith.<a name=6:12></a> I am not alluding to the fatherhood of God, but the fatherly element that is so essential to the promotion of faith proper to the remnant; for, as I hope to show, today it comes in for divine recognition as of the assembly, that which has the greatest place

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		in relation to Christ.<a name=7:1></a> Where the assembly is left out in ministry, a great void is apparent and a great lack of power, too, for in the ministry of the Holy Spirit Christ in relation to the assembly has a great place.<a name=7:2></a> It is said of Him, "gave him to be head over all things to the assembly, which is his body, the fulness of him who fills all in all".<a name=7:3></a> <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:22">Ephesians  1:22</a>,23.<a name=7:4></a>

		To make the subject simple, the idea of father in Abraham may be connected with Corinthians; the idea of the mother belongs to Galatians.<a name=7:5></a> We shall not be in the remnant nor of it, according to God, save as we understand these epistles and they affect us.<a name=7:6></a> One leading idea of the father in the family is authority.<a name=7:7></a> Authority, of course, is vested in Christ in heaven, but then He has revested it down here.<a name=7:8></a> We are told that He gave His servants the authority; <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#13:34">Mark  13:34</a>.<a name=7:9></a> It works out in the way of authority in a family sense.<a name=7:10></a> Authority in a father is where it is least irksome; and nowhere is authority less irksome, normally, than in the assembly.<a name=7:11></a> It is not harsh, it is not arbitrary.<a name=7:12></a> What it is in Christ, it is in the assembly.<a name=7:13></a> It is there so much that it says that if a refractory one does not hear the assembly he is to be regarded as a heathen man and a publican; <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:17">Matthew  18:17</a>.<a name=7:14></a>

		Refusing to listen to two brothers is serious, but refusing to hear the assembly is most grave.<a name=7:15></a> The assembly neither teaches nor preaches, but authority is exercised there.<a name=7:16></a> Teaching and preaching are by persons who have gift, but authority is vested in the assembly.<a name=7:17></a> So that one refusing to hear the assembly, or indeed those who are walking humbly in the light of it, is regarded as outside the pale, practically, of christian fellowship.<a name=7:18></a> The apostle Paul, in writing to the Corinthians, asserts the paternal principle as to himself.<a name=7:19></a> He says, "What will ye?<a name=7:20></a> Shall I come unto you with a rod?<a name=7:21></a>" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#4:21">1 Corinthians  4:21</a>.<a name=7:22></a> That is a father's prerogative.<a name=7:23></a> And in verse 15 he says, "For though ye have ten thousand instructors, in Christ .<a name=7:24></a>.<a name=7:25></a>.<a name=7:26></a> I have begotten you through the gospel".<a name=7:27></a>

		You will understand I am not referring to the fatherhood of God.<a name=8:2></a> It is a question of fatherly authority down here in the saints.<a name=8:3></a> Who had a better right with the Corinthians to take that attitude than the one through whom they had been converted, through whom they had been begotten in Christ Jesus through the gospel?<a name=8:4></a> "As my beloved sons", he says, "I admonish you".<a name=8:5></a> <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#4:14">1 Corinthians  4:14</a>.<a name=8:6></a> No one can fully take that ground today, but; it will not do to assume that there is no such authority.<a name=8:7></a> I am afraid some young people do.<a name=8:8></a> The drift of things, even in a natural way, is to set aside authority altogether.<a name=8:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in the second epistle he intimates confidence in them.<a name=8:10></a> His first letter of fatherly authority had been effective.<a name=8:11></a> It had brought about mourning, etc.<a name=8:12></a>, on account of the wickedness that had existed among them.<a name=8:13></a> And he says, "for an answering recompense, (I speak as to children,) let <i>your</i> heart also expand itself".<a name=8:14></a> <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#6:13">2 Corinthians  6:13</a>.<a name=8:15></a> Do you ever think of that, "Let your heart also expand itself", as answering to the injunction of a father?<a name=8:16></a> As I said, no one could take that place exactly today, but let no one assume that there is no such thing as the fatherly element among the people of God.<a name=8:17></a> John says, "I write unto you, fathers".<a name=8:18></a> <a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:13">1 John  2:13</a>.<a name=8:19></a> They would, because of their experience, have moral authority and would use it against evil among the people of God.<a name=8:20></a> God will not tolerate evil.<a name=8:21></a> It pains Him more in the christian than in any; it is more sorrowful there than elsewhere, and He "is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints".<a name=8:22></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#89:7">Psalm  89:7</a>.<a name=8:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So that we do well to take account of those in whom God has vested authority.<a name=8:24></a> It is not a question of officialism but of moral power and fatherly affection in those who, by experience, have come to love the saints, and correspondingly to hate what is of the world in them.<a name=8:25></a> "What fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness?<a name=8:26></a> and what communion hath light with darkness?<a name=8:27></a> And what concord hath Christ with Belial?<a name=8:28></a>" <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#6:14">2 Corinthians  6:14</a>,15.<a name=8:29></a>

		The world is an abhorrent thing in the saints, and God has vested authority in certain here to rebuke it.<a name=9:2></a> Abraham represents the thought of father.<a name=9:3></a> His name signifies 'father of a multitude'.<a name=9:4></a> Names in Scripture mean something, the idea of father of the household of faith was represented in this man.<a name=9:5></a> Think of belonging to that household!<a name=9:6></a> Two belonging to it outwardly had to be cast out of it.<a name=9:7></a> A solemn thing!<a name=9:8></a> Hagar and Ishmael were cast out.<a name=9:9></a>

		You will observe the occurrence of the word 'precious' in these scriptures, and I have that word in mind as denoting, in these settings, what is peculiarly valuable as attached to Christ's Person, and the things that come to Him as Man; The first scripture from the apostle Peter is characteristic of one who led in the way of appraisement of Christ, giving us a lead in this connection.<a name=50:1></a> The apostles are intended to lead us in regard to valuation or appraisement of what is more excellent.<a name=50:2></a> There are the great general foundational truths, the knowledge of which is required for the deliverance, peace and blessing of our souls.<a name=50:3></a> These truths acquired in their true relations, both in regard of God and ourselves, set us free for exploration and appraisement of what is more excellent.<a name=50:4></a> As we progress on this line we become ranged in regard of quality, for there are persons and persons.<a name=50:5></a> The heavenly city contains only one street according to the Scriptures, suggesting equality in dignity of all of us, yet there are gradations of quality and development.<a name=50:6></a> These gradations are reached now, but remain and mark us for ever.<a name=50:7></a>

		J.T.<a name=80:1></a> I was thinking of general fellowship and local fellowship, and the responsibility that attaches to each.<a name=80:2></a> I thought this subject would be one that would yield something for us at this meeting -- that is, the subject of fellowship in a general and local sense and particularly the responsibility attaching to each respectively, for we at times are unduly local and unduly general.<a name=80:3></a> So that a right balance is what the Lord would always lead to, and it occurred to me that the first scripture read links the two ideas together, or rather makes them one; for whilst the address is to the assembly of God which is at Corinth we read it is to the "sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, with all that in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both theirs and ours".<a name=80:4></a> It is not, of course, that the apostle would imply that his directions as to administration should be taken part in by all at one time, but certainly any act of administration at Corinth should not be of an independent nature, it should be such as would take account of "all that in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both theirs and ours".<a name=80:5></a> So that any question raised at Rome or in Jerusalem or in Africa as to an act in Corinth would be answered and would not be regarded as a matter belonging to Corinth exclusively, for the obvious teaching is that the same Lord is "both theirs and ours".<a name=80:6></a> It is His matter and the principle of universality would be maintained while wisdom would recognise "put away from among yourselves that wicked person" <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5:13">1 Corinthians  5:13</a> alluded to Corinth, but as put away in Corinth he would be put away everywhere.<a name=80:7></a> It would be regarded as an act binding on the assembly

		I have in mind to present from these scriptures some thoughts as to guidance -- guidance by what is in the heavens, what I might designate as entirely objective, and then guidance by what is on the earth -- that is, the light of heaven and the light of life.<a name=94:1></a> These two means of guidance are collateral; that is, they run together and should not be separated.<a name=94:2></a> We find them early, the first is in the record of the fourth day in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>, and the second is in the fifth and sixth days.<a name=94:3></a> The principle of life precedes this -- in the third day of Genesis l -- and that is not accidental, it is designed, the divine thought obviously being that the principle of life exists; otherwise guidance, or the means of guidance, would have no force, for inanimate things need no guidance.<a name=94:4></a> Nor would there be anything answering at all to God in the universe aside from life, for God is the living God.<a name=94:5></a> So the principle of life is seen in the third day.<a name=94:6></a> It is but the principle, as I said, the law of life; that is, vegetable life, a kind of figure much used in Scripture as to life -- that is life according to God -- and is only capable in persons.<a name=94:7></a> The figure is applied to persons, even as to the Lord Himself as "the grain of wheat falling into the ground".<a name=94:8></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#12:24">John  12:24</a>.<a name=94:9></a> And so the principle of life being there, we have the luminaries set up in the heavens which divide between the night and the day, to be for signs, for years, for seasons.<a name=94:10></a> And they stand, they are in a way fixed and so may be likened in some sense to principles.<a name=94:11></a> Principles are fixed and unvarying, whereas life is pliable and so the full thought of it awaited the incarnation of the Lord Jesus.<a name=94:12></a> Hence we have,

		He comes in and shows Moses wood; that is, He calls the minister's attention to Christ.<a name=125:1></a> The point is first to get in our minds the thought of the minister God provides.<a name=125:2></a> He calls the attention of the minister to the wood; it says, "Jehovah shewed him wood, and he cast it into the waters, and the waters became sweet" <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15:25">Exodus  15:25</a>.<a name=125:3></a> That is the minister's move; it is left to him.<a name=125:4></a> God, having instructed, educated and explained things to his servants, helps them and calls their attention to some feature of Christ, and they know how to use it, and use it effectively.<a name=125:5></a> What you find with regard to Moses throughout this book is that, whilst we constantly get the expression, "As Jehovah said unto Moses", or "As the Lord commanded Moses", yet Moses acts of himself; as, for instance, with regard to the instruction relative to the passover in chapter 12, you find it is a lengthy instruction, but Moses, when speaking to the people about it, epitomises it, and his epitome -- or his presentation of what Jehovah gave to him -- brings about worship in the people.<a name=125:6></a> That means that you know how to present impressions you receive from God so that they become effective in the saints.<a name=125:7></a>

		I had in mind, dear brethren, to speak about perfection; the idea would become simple if the Lord helped me to dwell upon the things that belong to it.<a name=145:1></a> That is, I believe, the meaning of the clause I read in verse 1, "Let us go on to what belongs to full growth", or perfection.<a name=145:2></a> As these things are detailed in any measure, I believe the youngest here will understand what is in my mind -- the idea of perfection, of full growth.<a name=145:3></a> The suggestion of it must always be of interest and importance; for conditions generally among the saints of God are not just characterised by perfection -- the babe state, indeed, may be said to mark the people of God generally, whereas the divine mind is full growth, or perfection, and for that there must be some standard, which is also evident.<a name=145:4></a> And God has brought in that -- indeed He began with it; whether we go back to His eternal counsels, or whether we go back to the detailed work of <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>and 2, we see that God began with the full thought.<a name=145:5></a> For instance, He made birds and fishes and cattle; there is no idea of His creating an egg or a lamb; when He came to man, there is no idea of a babe -- He made a man, He made a woman.<a name=145:6></a> Nor had Eve any other thought when Cain was born, she caned him a man -- "I have acquired a man with Jehovah".<a name=145:7></a> <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#4:1">Genesis  4:1</a>.<a name=145:8></a> The babe idea had not yet taken form in her mind; and so the Lord, in comforting His disciples, speaks of the joy at the birth of a child that a man is born into the world.<a name=145:9></a> And so in the types, in the Israelite's house, however many children there may have been, they were all to have an omer of manna, the father

		This passage in Hebrews has that in mind; it is a passage of scripture calculated to stem the tide of retrogression which had set in.<a name=146:3></a> There is always, I may say, a tendency with the people of God to retrograde.<a name=146:4></a> If a little bit of growth has been attained, the tendency to retrograde is always present; the ministry, the general service graciously provided by the Lord, is to meet that condition amongst us and to maintain steadiness where God has begun; there should be a steadiness with us to His thought.<a name=146:5></a> So the word is, Let us go on to the <i>things</i> that belong to full growth.<a name=146:6></a> Young christians may say, There is Mr.<a name=146:7></a> So-and-so, he has been a long way in the path, I cannot hope to attain to his measure.<a name=146:8></a> But then, let us begin with the <i>things</i>.<a name=146:9></a> What marked that brother in his earlier days?<a name=146:10></a> He had to begin young, too; and his progress was marked by certain things.<a name=146:11></a> The writer of this epistle alludes to what he would regard, as the opposite to progress at that particular time; he refers, for instance (but not with any thought of discrediting them) to "a foundation of repentance from dead works and faith in God, of the doctrine of washings, and of imposition of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment".<a name=146:12></a> <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#6:1">Hebrews  6:1</a>,2.<a name=146:13></a> A christian in the Establishment might be familiar with such a category of things, right perhaps in themselves; but he must take other ground, he is not in the Establishment now.<a name=146:14></a> You will see what I mean.<a name=146:15></a> Were he there, there might be a certain consistency in his occupation with such things; but he is not there now.<a name=146:16></a> Those things belonged to Israel before Christ was born, or died.<a name=146:17></a> The Jewish believer in Christ had moved professedly, and occupation with

		Now I go on to the older ones, and I have selected Abraham, as you will see, to illustrate the idea of perfection; he is brought in by the writer to the Hebrews as one who inherits the promises, and we are to imitate him.<a name=150:9></a> You will notice, first, that he is to walk before God and be perfect.<a name=150:10></a> He was an old man, so that he certainly fits as an example for those of us who are older, Jehovah appears to him and says, "Walk before me" -- a word that comes to one's own heart, because in service we are apt to walk before the brethren.<a name=150:11></a> That is right, surely, to commend oneself to them; but then the word is, "Walk before <i>me</i>".<a name=150:12></a> What eyes those were that would look down on Abraham every day in his walk!<a name=150:13></a> And then, "Be perfect".<a name=150:14></a> One wishes to show as briefly as possible from these scriptures how this great thought was worked out in the patriarch.<a name=150:15></a> First, he is to walk

		Then there is the son of Abraham, of whom we read in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#19">Luke  19</a>, and I want especially to speak about him, that is Zacchaeus.<a name=180:2></a> The Lord takes special interest in this man.<a name=180:3></a> One loves to notice any particular movement of the Lord.<a name=180:4></a> He called the woman to Him, and He said, "Thou art loosed from thine infirmity".<a name=180:5></a> <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#13:12">Luke  13:12</a>.<a name=180:6></a> That was a matter of words.<a name=180:7></a> In the case of this "son of Abraham", the Lord takes great pains with him.<a name=180:8></a> It may be that there is someone here like that.<a name=180:9></a> The Lord has taken much trouble with you, and there has been no definite result so far.<a name=180:10></a> In this gospel we find that the first mention of Simon Peter is that the Lord entered into his house; <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4:38">Luke  4:38</a>.<a name=180:11></a> His wife's mother was sick of a fever, and the Lord stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her, but it did not appear to have any effect upon Peter.<a name=180:12></a> The Lord had come very near to him.<a name=180:13></a> He had come into Peter's house, and performed this wonderful cure on his mother-in-law, changing the whole atmosphere in that house.<a name=180:14></a> It must have been an uncomfortable house.<a name=180:15></a> There are today, alas, great domestic disturbances, even among the people of God, and the service of God is hindered by these disturbances.<a name=180:16></a> The Lord took great pains with Peter's mother-in-law.<a name=180:17></a> He went into the house and, standing over her, healed her, and she arose and served, causing great change in the house, and yet apparently Peter was not affected.<a name=180:18></a> Is your case like that?<a name=180:19></a>

		As regards ministry for the young, it seems to me that Scripture warrants it.<a name=185:2></a> But it is not seen as a separate department, so to speak.<a name=185:3></a> He who made God known took little children in His arms, and Paul fed the Corinthians with milk as unable for meat, and John writes to little children as distinct from fathers and young men.<a name=185:4></a> Peter urges that those he addressed should desire the pure mental milk of the word so as to grow by it.<a name=185:5></a> Thus the same person ministers to old and young.<a name=185:6></a> It is a question therefore of discerning <i>what is needed</i>, and hence <i>spirituality</i> is essential if young people are to be properly served.<a name=185:7></a>

		As you say, 'young people are especially exposed to the wicked doctrines and views of modernism'; and this should be borne in mind in what is set before them, that is, 'meal' is to be put into the pot to counteract the poison.<a name=185:8></a> What they are to be fed with is Christ, and, of course, He is the food for old christians also, so that all eat the same spiritual food; but there is the 'milk' and the 'meat', and those who serve must know how to differentiate both as to the state of those he serves, and the food he has to present.<a name=185:9></a> The "household" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#24:45">Matthew  24:45</a>, including all grades, has to be provided for, and it is obvious that the "prudent bondman" will not set before the babes the same food (although all may use milk) that he sets before the full-grown.<a name=185:10></a> The <i>same</i> bondman provides for all, and this agrees with what I said above.<a name=185:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus it is clear that the great thought of the house, or household, should always be in view in ministry, and if young ones are to be fed, what they <i>can</i> eat and assimilate must be given them, and not what is beyond their digestive capacity.<a name=185:12></a>

		Ministry -- or meetings specially for young people -- is really a matter of levitical wisdom, and the true levite will not fail to keep the household of God, the assembly, in view in all he does; he will impress on his hearers that they belong to it, or that it is in view for them, and that he is seeking to get down to their range of understanding (an important matter) in what he is saying, so as to lead them into "greater things".<a name=186:1></a> Thus they will hear and ask questions and have <i>understanding and answers;</i> <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2">Luke  2</a>.<a name=186:2></a>

		These scriptures speak of the richness of that into which we are brought, namely, the land, the word 'land' being used seven times in those verses in chapter 8 to call attention to the richness, the wealth, of that into which we are brought, not that into which we shall be brought merely, but that into which we are brought, for the land typifies our present portion.<a name=191:1></a> It is not exactly a type of heaven literally, that into which we shall be brought when the Lord descends from heaven, as we are told, and raises the saints from the dead, from sleeping, and changes us who are alive and remain; the land of promise is rather what we are brought into now, something to be understood, a place of great richness, a land which requires no imports.<a name=191:2></a> No nation in the world can be spoken of in this way, scarcely any nation, if any, is independent of the products of other nations.<a name=191:3></a> Our land is, as I hope to show in detail; there is no need of importations of commodities.<a name=191:4></a>

		J.T.<a name=202:1></a> If we compare the last verse of Luke with this chapter, we shall observe a striking difference in the bearing which is there towards the Jewish remnant, as left here with jubilant spirit "praising and blessing God" in the temple <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:53">Luke  24:53</a>; while in this chapter the bearing is toward the assembly, We have allusions to it which indicate this.<a name=202:2></a> In verse 4 it says, "being assembled with them"; then in verse 21, "the men who have assembled with us"; and further, we have allusions to ascension, "Having said these things he was taken up, they beholding him" (verse 9); then, in verse 10, "as they were gazing into heaven, as he was going, behold, also two men stood by them in white clothing, who also said, Men of Galilee, why do ye stand looking into heaven?<a name=202:3></a>" "Then", it says, "they returned to Jerusalem .<a name=202:4></a>.<a name=202:5></a>.<a name=202:6></a> .<a name=202:7></a> And when they were come into the city, they went up to the upper chamber" (verse 13).<a name=202:8></a> These are two lines of thought running through the chapter.<a name=202:9></a> Then there is the statement in verse 3, that "he presented himself living, after he had suffered".<a name=202:10></a> I thought we might look at these scriptures under those heads: first, as indicating that the assembly was to be marked as living; then, that there is the understanding of how to assemble in the Lord having assembled with them; then thirdly, there is the thought of ascension and moral elevation in going <i>up</i> to the upper room; then the manner of Christ's own ascension in that "he was taken up, they beholding him", and in the two men saying, "This Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven, shall thus come in the manner in which ye have beheld him going into heaven" (verse 11).<a name=202:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=204:3></a> It is suggestive of a living state of things, I think, after He had suffered; of course He was living before, but now it is "after he had suffered" -- the "being seen by them during forty days" alludes to a spiritual state of things, that brings them into it as witnesses of the forty days, a known thing by persons like ourselves, that He was seen <i>by them</i> for forty days -- to bring in that there is such a thing as seeing Him in resurrection in the experience of the assembly.<a name=204:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=204:7></a> Yes, I think so, that He has gone into heaven; they are here, so all this is to qualify them for this service, to be His witnesses.<a name=204:8></a> I find in moving about that certain gatherings are somewhat confused as to assembly service, through the want of apprehending that the Minister is in heaven; and whilst He joins us here, in a spiritual sense, the service is carried on now in relation to heaven, and as the Lord is apprehended as indicated here in this chapter, He carries on the service in relation to God the Father.<a name=204:9></a> He is rightly enough an Object of worship, as the Father is, all are to honour Him, as they honour the Father, but if He takes a subordinate place, you see why that is so and join Him in that place, so that the service is carried on according to divine purpose, according to what it will be eternally.<a name=204:10></a>

		J.T.<a name=232:1></a> This chapter contains peculiar instruction for those who serve.<a name=232:2></a> All the Lord's people, of course, should serve in some sense; but there are skilled labourers and unskilled labourers, and this chapter is for those who are, or who should be, skilled -- indeed it is so that we should be skilled.<a name=232:3></a> It occurred to me that it would be helpful for all, as well as those who serve in this way, to look into it, especially as the Lord's attention to those who serve brings out results in His being better known.<a name=232:4></a> Indeed He is, as it were, everything.<a name=232:5></a> He has His own way of distinguishing His servants, putting them forward as He may need them in the front, but the more the servant is with Him, the more Jesus is everything; what is done is done by Him; and what is to be observed here is that, at the beginning of the chapter, that is in verses 1 - 6, He is thought but little of, despised indeed; and then in verses 7 - 13 we have the sending out of the servants, the apostles; and in verse 30, the account which they give of their service; but inserted is the solemn martyrdom of, up to that time, the greatest servant among men, that is, John the baptist.<a name=232:6></a> So that, in serving, this stands out, that martyrdom is to be expected; the more faithful the service, the more likely the martyrdom.<a name=232:7></a> What is in mind particularly is the Lord's care for us, and what becomes incidental, the care of others, the feeding of the multitude, and how He becomes increasingly known through His care for His servants; they will be prominent as they are faithful, but the point is <i>His</i> prominence.<a name=232:8></a>

		J.T.<a name=240:3></a> I think so.<a name=240:4></a> It is fifties and hundreds here; Luke confines us to fifties, and I think the Spirit of God there indicates the Lord's mind imperatively; here the matter is more elastic.<a name=240:5></a>

		J.T.<a name=240:13></a> Yes, the large numbers arouse the Lord's compassion; "they were as sheep", it says, "not having a shepherd" -- that is, they were not housed and cared for generally; and I think this implies that the servant is to see to that.<a name=240:14></a> The shepherd's business is to see to the sheep, not only as to their food, but as to their general welfare and comfort.<a name=240:15></a> Therefore, enquiry as to the meetings and their size is a matter of great importance in the service, and that the saints should be helped in a general way, for it is a question of the general state of things, that they may get with greater effect what there is for them.<a name=240:16></a>

		J.T.<a name=274:1></a> It will be known to most of us that this psalm begins the last book of Psalms, looking to the recovery and the reinstatement of Israel in nearness to God, carrying on the service of praise; and we have this thought of leadership introduced at the outset as it takes form in the last days, and what the object of it is, that is, a city of habitation, and it results in those who share in the leadership establishing a city of habitation marked by prosperity.<a name=274:2></a> Then in the prophet we have leadership of old, leadership at the outset, which is to be compared with leadership in the last days, a gathering involved in it, and what is noticeable is the place the Holy Spirit has in the leadership in the beginning in the prophets -- because "his holy Spirit within him" applied to the leadership -- and then it says, "his glorious arm leading them by the right hand of Moses, dividing the waters before them, to make himself an everlasting name, -- who led them through the depths, like a horse in the wilderness, and they stumbled not!<a name=274:3></a> As cattle go down into the valley, the Spirit of Jehovah gave them rest; so didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious name".<a name=274:4></a> I thought the comparison of these scriptures would help us as to the results of divine leadership and how we are to learn from it all as to how we are to lead in a <i>right way</i> amongst the brethren.<a name=274:5></a> There is leadership and leadership; but these scriptures show us what leadership in a right way is, to the end that men might go to a city of habitation, that is, a place of order, light and rule, and yet a place suitable to dwell in.<a name=274:6></a> That is what I was thinking of.<a name=274:7></a>

		J.T.<a name=275:9></a> Well, the psalm, of course, opens up the plight in which men find themselves through want of this very thing; one circumstance after another involving distress amongst men.<a name=275:10></a> God in His wisdom allows us to go to a point, and then comes in for us -- men are to praise Him for His goodness and for His wonderful works to the children of men.<a name=275:11></a> The psalm contemplates all that; and where the saints were -- they wandered in the wilderness, He gathered them; they found no city of habitation -- "Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses, and he led them forth by a right way, that they might go to a city of habitation".<a name=275:12></a> I think anyone can see that the conditions in verse 7, what is in the mind of God for them, must have been a very great contrast to their circumstances.<a name=275:13></a> It is not the deliverance out of Egypt that is in mind, it is a subsequent deliverance.<a name=275:14></a> Then He goes back to the deliverance out of Egypt in the prophet to show what a place the Spirit has in it.<a name=275:15></a> So that, whilst we accept the kind of leadership that belongs to the last days, we do not forget the great leadership at the beginning; the Holy Spirit had a great deal to do with it, it is a spiritual state of things.<a name=275:16></a>

		These scriptures taken together, or even severally, convey the suggestion of which I have in mind to speak, namely, the impartation of spiritual knowledge.<a name=308:1></a> I read from John with the object of setting out the general bearing of the subject in these days of ours, for we have often remarked to one another, and no doubt all recognise it, that John's writings have the last days in mind, and it is noticeable that teaching has a distinguished place with him, especially in his gospel.<a name=308:2></a> It will be remembered that even "the teacher of Israel" <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:10">John  3:10</a> addressed the Lord as "Rabbi", and added, "we know that thou art come a teacher from God" <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:2">John  3:2</a>.<a name=308:3></a> That is a word that enters into the present time, and, indeed, has marked divine activities for a hundred years or more, but particularly for the last hundred years -- the idea of teaching from God.<a name=308:4></a> The idea of teaching acquired a place in the early history of the assembly.<a name=308:5></a> Spiritually it had a great place in the apostles with the Lord, but it acquired a place later as arising from the felt need of the religious leaders to keep abreast of the teaching of the world, so that philosophy and vain deceit were allowed a place.<a name=308:6></a> John would shut them out, and Paul would shut them out, as we learn in his letter to Colosse; but they found an entrance, and have retained a hold on the leaders of christendom ever since, and never more than at the present time.<a name=308:7></a> So that the thought of "a teacher from God" as you can see, has great significance in John's gospel, especially as spoken of by the one whom the Lord speaks to as "<i>the</i> teacher of Israel".<a name=308:8></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:10">John  3:10</a>.<a name=308:9></a>

		Him as "Teacher" or "Rabbi", and the Spirit of God is careful to tell us in a very formal way that the word signifies "Teacher", being thus interpreted so that there should be no mistake.<a name=309:1></a> Hence the Lord acquired amongst men the title spiritually -- as, indeed, is general with divine titles -- as the outcome of human experience.<a name=309:2></a> Divine titles are without exception set in that way; they arise from human experience -- human experience, of course, in which God has part; for any other experience is of no value, nor does God respect it.<a name=309:3></a> Experience with God has always an outcome which God respects, and from the very earliest days, according to the Scriptures, this feature appears; as, for instance, the name 'Jehovah' when first mentioned by Eve arises from her experience; she says, "I have acquired a man with Jehovah" <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#4:1">Genesis  4:1</a>, as if she experienced His help.<a name=309:4></a> So in John's gospel the principle of naming what we experience spiritually is in evidence; in fact, if one experiences a thing rightly, if one has to do with a thing intelligently, one ought to be able to name the thing.<a name=309:5></a> It is when one names it that one shows one has profited by it.<a name=309:6></a> The hearts of these two disciples were touched by the beautiful words of John the baptist as he looked on Jesus as He walked.<a name=309:7></a> It is a beautiful illustration of the influence that we may exert, as we have spoken of today.<a name=309:8></a> John influenced his own disciples, not only by his words, but by the tone of them.<a name=309:9></a> He was affected himself, and his disciples left him and followed Jesus.<a name=309:10></a> Jesus saw them following, and He says, "<i>What"</i>, not 'whom', but "What seek ye?<a name=309:11></a>" And they said, "Teacher, where abidest thou?<a name=309:12></a>" The meaning of the word <i>they</i> used is then explained to us carefully, meaning that in their souls they wanted to be taught; although touched in their affections, they needed teaching, and they felt it, and they said, 'Lord, where do You dwell, or abide?<a name=309:13></a>' That is the first thing they enquire.<a name=309:14></a>

		I mention all this, dear brethren, that we may understand that divine education involves not only from whom, but <i>where</i> we learn.<a name=310:1></a> Even although it may be the very best teaching, it may be affected adversely by the whereabouts, by the surroundings; so that the enquiry of these disciples is instinctively right, and it should be reflected in every young disciple today, everyone whose heart is drawn to Jesus: "where abidest thou?<a name=310:2></a>" The Lord says, "Come and see".<a name=310:3></a> That is another mark of John which is to be observed, that he expects us to move.<a name=310:4></a> Stationary christians are discredited in his eyes, for armchair christianity is abhorrent to John, and indeed, to the Scriptures.<a name=310:5></a> He contemplates that if you are affected you will move.<a name=310:6></a> Hence the Lord says, "Come and see" -- one of the finest words you get.<a name=310:7></a> Elsewhere we are told that certain who were affected by the testimony of Christ came to Jesus, but they found a man, the man out of whom the demons had gone, sitting, clothed, and in his right mind.<a name=310:8></a> He was at the feet of Jesus.<a name=310:9></a> He is an example, and example is a great matter.<a name=310:10></a> These who came to Jesus found the man, and his attitude and clothing are spoken of.<a name=310:11></a> The obvious suggestion is that you would sit down by him, sitting, clothed, at the feet of Jesus.<a name=310:12></a> That is the place to learn, and you learn in company with others.<a name=310:13></a> But here the Lord says, "Come and see"; He invited them, and they came: "They went therefore, and saw where he abode; and they abode with him that day.<a name=310:14></a> It was about the tenth hour".<a name=310:15></a> John gives us these details.<a name=310:16></a> No doubt the idea of instruction is there; that is what is in their minds, and the Lord will never disappoint anything which is in our minds if it is according to Him; He will always gratify it.<a name=310:17></a> That was in their minds, and we may well infer, dear brethren, that there was something in the way of teaching; but the point that I would make is the surroundings, where it was, where He abode.<a name=310:18></a> He

		In pursuing a little further what comes out through John in regard of this matter, I would call attention of the sisters to this question of teaching; and, without being critical, I would say here, dear brethren, that our sisters would do well to notice what John records about this subject in his gospel; because many are apt to leave the teaching, say, to brothers, taking in a little, perhaps, here and there; but to sit down and learn divine things systematically is not very common with our sisters; perhaps not with any of us, but certainly not with our sisters.<a name=311:2></a> They are not allowed to speak in the assembly or teach, but that is no reason why they should not sit down and learn systematically.<a name=311:3></a> That is what Mary of Bethany did; she learnt systematically, even in the presence of opposition and severe criticism; she sat at the feet of Jesus and listened to His word.<a name=311:4></a> It is not a matter of asking the Lord some particular question: sisters are very apt to do that; they want a particular question settled; but the point with Mary of Bethany was that she listened to what the Lord was saying; whatever it was that He was saying was of moment to her.<a name=311:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		John does not record that, but he records another incident which is very creditable to her as an example.<a name=311:6></a> Her sister Martha who complained so bitterly about her, according to Luke's gospel, was intelligent as to the fact of the Lord's coming to Bethany; she says to Mary, "The teacher is come and calls thee", <a href="../bible/John.htm#11:28">John  11:28</a>.<a name=311:7></a> How becoming that the Teacher should call for one who had been accustomed to sit down and take in and appropriate what He said.<a name=311:8></a> "The teacher is come", says Martha, "and calls thee".<a name=311:9></a> Martha had heard the most wonderful things from His lips

		just then, and she broke off the conversation by a wonderful confession, "Yea, Lord; I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, who should come into the world" <a href="../bible/John.htm#11:27">John  11:27</a> -- a fine confession -- and then she went off in haste to Mary secretly, and says, "The teacher is come" -- what a wonderful fact it was -- "and calls thee".<a name=312:1></a> Is there a christian on earth whom He does not call?<a name=312:2></a> I do not think so.<a name=312:3></a> He is knocking at the doors of christians in the world in order that He might come in and sup with them, and they with Him.<a name=312:4></a> "The teacher is come and calls thee": <a href="../bible/John.htm#11:28">John  11:28</a> there is not one here to whom that does not apply.<a name=312:5></a> The Lord has an interest in every one of us in regard to this matter.<a name=312:6></a>

		So with another Mary, Mary of Magdala, out of whom seven demons had gone, she also, according to <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>, calls the Lord in Hebrew (as is probably the original rendering), "Rabboni", <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:16">John  20:16</a> as if she would appropriate it to herself, and there again we are told what the word means, although without the same formality or stress as in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>; it is simply said here that it means "Teacher".<a name=312:7></a> The Lord is risen from the dead, and is speaking to her, and she says, "Rabboni".<a name=312:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		You see that what I am speaking of at the moment, I am saying to the sisters.<a name=312:9></a> These are remarkable examples of christians in the early days who learned systematically, and expressed their appreciation of what they learned by the titles they gave the Lord -- though Mary of Magdala changes the word somewhat, she does so, not by accident, but with some purpose -- but it is left in a general way as meaning, "Teacher".<a name=312:10></a> The Lord would speak to our beloved sisters here and everywhere as to this great matter, that we might become instructed in the whole system of truth, the truth of the gospel, and of the assembly, too, the truth of the heavenly calling.<a name=312:11></a> We must not be content with anything less than the whole range of truth.<a name=312:12></a>

		Now I want to go to the book of Acts because it deals with the early days.<a name=313:1></a> John deals with the last days, and he has a beautiful way of presenting things informally and affectingly with the intent that we should get these things into our souls; without our knowing it, they are there; but in Acts we get the beginning, and, of course, the word always remains in its freshness, however late in the dispensation.<a name=313:2></a> John indeed tells us that Jesus went back to the Jordan after the Jews had surrounded Him and their efforts to take Him were prevented, He went back to the place where John baptised at the first, meaning that He went back to first principles, not to begin over again on another line; and "many believed on him there" <a href="../bible/John.htm#10:42">John  10:42</a>, showing that He had material to go on with.<a name=313:3></a> "Many believed on him <i>there</i>"; that is the best place in which to believe on Him, where He began, where the heavens opened on Him, and the Holy Spirit was seen coming down, and the Father's voice was heard saying, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased".<a name=313:4></a> <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#3:17">Matthew  3:17</a>.<a name=313:5></a> That is the place to which the Lord went, and "many believed on him there".<a name=313:6></a> John asserts that; the book of Acts has that also in mind, so that the writer begins by speaking of "all things which Jesus began both to do and to teach" <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:1">Acts  1:1</a>; what He did comes first, and then the teaching, the idea being that you have the things presented concretely in some person or persons, and then you have the teaching.<a name=313:7></a> The teaching is to open up what the things mean.<a name=313:8></a> Abstract christianity does not pay any attention to what is done, but only to what is in the creed, but you want what is done first.<a name=313:9></a> If the creed-maker is able to do the thing, then let him teach.<a name=313:10></a> True christianity is in the doing, and the teaching opens up to you what is meant, what things are.<a name=313:11></a>

		So in Ephesus, where, under God, the apostle's greatest success was, he entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews three months: but they

		Now you may say, that is not a great number; nor is it, but the chapter does give a great number, indeed, it speaks in such a way as to satisfy every one who has any idea of numbers.<a name=329:1></a> What the number is that God will have is such as to exceed the mind to compass -- the number of the redeemed; so that this 144,000 is not a great number in that sense, but it is a very great number morally, it is the number that <i>God wishes</i>.<a name=329:2></a> You may enquire, Is it a question with Him how many?<a name=329:3></a> It is a great question with Him, and it is a solemn thing for you if <i>you</i> are not included in His number.<a name=329:4></a> The idea of number is a very important matter with Him.<a name=329:5></a> How could He make a universe except on the principle of measure?<a name=329:6></a> He is "the God of measure", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#10:13">2 Corinthians  10:13</a> and so all must be measured on that principle with Him, even to a hairbreadth; there must be no discrepancy or loose ends in God's measures or weights, and so here He has 144,000.<a name=329:7></a> This is, I might say, an arbitrary number.<a name=329:8></a> No intelligent christian would assume that this is the actual number of those who will be saved out of the tribes of Israel; it is a <i>symbolical</i> number, a number that conveys the idea of manipulation, that is, it is <i>usable</i>, a number that can be easily divided and sub-divided, so that God can carry out His thoughts.<a name=329:9></a> In this sense divisibility implies that <i>love</i> exists in the persons numbered -- that they are entirely at God's disposal.<a name=329:10></a> Thus 144,000 is God's number, and it is taken out of the tribes of Israel, 12,000 out of each tribe -- <i>taken out of</i>.<a name=329:11></a>

		I have in mind, as perhaps you will divine, to speak about the youth amongst the people of God.<a name=344:1></a> I am actuated in the thought by the circumstances in this district, in this town, and in view of the trend of the work of God at the present time generally.<a name=344:2></a> God would have the youth kept in view, that they may not lack anything in coming into the position in the testimony occupied by their elders; indeed, that they may not fail to gain what is to be gained from their elders and at the same time be in direct touch with God, so that they may take on their own distinctive testimony; for something distinctive attaches to the testimony in each generation.<a name=344:3></a> Hence the principle of Scripture, applying to old and young, "they shall be all taught of God", <a href="../bible/John.htm#6:45">John  6:45</a>.<a name=344:4></a> So that we carry forward the distinctive features of the current and passing generation -- losing nothing -- that all may be cumulative; for all is pure gold, whether old or new.<a name=344:5></a> They may have what is distinctive to themselves, as I said, and that could only be as they are taught of God; which means they have it through direct relations with God.<a name=344:6></a> As the Lord says, "enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#6:6">Matthew  6:6</a>.<a name=344:7></a> That reward will take the form of something distinctive, some glory that you gather up there to be enhanced later in public testimony.<a name=344:8></a> The Lord would impress that on His disciples.<a name=344:9></a> He, as become Man, is the great public Teacher, as He says, "one is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#23:8">Matthew  23:8</a>.<a name=344:10></a> But whilst that is so, and remains so,

		He would impress on His disciples to have recourse to God; He is God, Jesus is God -- God manifest in the flesh.<a name=345:1></a> But still God maintains His own distinctive place on high, speaking to Jesus on earth from heaven and the Holy Spirit is maintaining His distinctiveness, coming down on Jesus in the form of a dove, so that God is to be apprehended whilst Jesus is here publicly and undertaking everything for God, representing God to man and representing man before God.<a name=345:2></a> Yet God retains His own invisibility and believers are to understand that God is invisible, that no one has seen Him or can see Him, and yet He is accessible.<a name=345:3></a> The Lord would impress this on His disciples that their relations should be maintained with God, whilst maintaining their relations with Him as representative of God in this world.<a name=345:4></a> Hence He had enjoined that they should enter into their closets and shut the door and pray to the Father in secret.<a name=345:5></a> He had already taught them how to pray.<a name=345:6></a> He did not say that that should be the <i>only</i> prayer.<a name=345:7></a> They should in secret with God learn to open their hearts to Him.<a name=345:8></a> He reads our hearts and the Spirit makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered -- so that we know that He hears us, we know that we have the petitions we desire.<a name=345:9></a> Now all this is most important for youth, so that there may be spiritual contact with God and formation according to God who is invisible, and who is said to be a Spirit.<a name=345:10></a> God is a Spirit; <a href="../bible/John.htm#4:24">John  4:24</a>.<a name=345:11></a> It is thus that we take on -- as the coming generation, as the generation which is to occupy the ground -- our own distinctiveness, whilst carrying on all that has preceded us; nothing is to be lost that marks what God graciously furnished to other generations.<a name=345:12></a>

		the Old Testament appears first in the patriarchal setting, that is in the book of Genesis where God is typified as the Father.<a name=346:1></a> Then in Joshua in Exodus youth is seen in relation to mediatorship -- the great system that God has inaugurated here to set forth the excellence of His glory and the maintenance of His testimony publicly; and then in Samuel how youth is seen in relation to the prophetic ministry, carrying on indeed the system inaugurated for the house of God as it was in Shiloh; it is a question of the prophetic ministry.<a name=346:2></a> Then finally in Solomon youth in relation to royalty.<a name=346:3></a>

		My subject in seeking to present the gospel tonight is hearts: what people say in their hearts first, and then what God says in His heart.<a name=357:1></a> The phrase "heart of God" is not so frequent in the Scriptures literally as might be imagined, although the Scriptures are full of the thought of the love of God; but the heart of God is stressed somewhat in the early chapters of the Bible -- a very interesting matter -- and set down alongside the human heart, the heart of man.<a name=357:2></a> Both are spoken of in the same passages.<a name=357:3></a> I wish to speak of God's heart particularly, but in order to arouse interest and conscience to work, I would allude to the word in Romans, which enjoins what is not to be said.<a name=357:4></a> What is <i>not</i> to be said.<a name=357:5></a> Quoting from the book of Deuteronomy the apostle conveniently cites "the righteousness which is of faith" and regards it as the speaker.<a name=357:6></a> The Spirit of God uses such methods regarding impersonal dealings to speak.<a name=357:7></a> He says, 'The Scriptures preach the gospel'.<a name=357:8></a> In the very early days before there was anything said about the evangelist, it is said, "And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham", <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3:8">Galatians  3:8</a>.<a name=357:9></a> It is an important word in regard to the Bible, and a word which encourages the circulation of the Bible; for the Scriptures preach the gospel according to that passage; and so the apostle Paul in writing to the Romans, cites a section of the book of Deuteronomy as saying to the people what they should <i>not</i> say in their hearts.<a name=357:10></a> He goes on to say a good deal about the heart afterwards, but the righteousness which is of faith begins by preaching certain things as said in

		John wants people who are christians, not theorists, and he sees it like this -- he is so impressed in his mind that he has Christ and God in the one pronoun, and it is only those who pay attention to things that get into this and see the true God in Jesus, the two ideas in one Person; that God is in Christ, brought down to us, then what man is in Christ in eternal life.<a name=380:18></a> The epistle is to bring that out, "That .<a name=380:19></a>.<a name=380:20></a>.<a name=380:21></a> which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life; (for the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us.<a name=380:22></a>)" <a href="../bible/1John.htm#1:1">1 John  1:1</a>,2.<a name=380:23></a>

		Following on what has been voiced in prayer, I feel free to read these scriptures as they convey what should occupy us, as I believe, on this occasion; firstly that, as has been remarked in prayer, the marriage of the Lamb should come into our minds.<a name=382:1></a> It is the one marriage indeed that Scripture presents to us, as I may say, bearing a public character, carrying with it the idea of celebration.<a name=382:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The idea of marriage, of course, is from the very outset of the human race, but little is made of the celebration of marriages in the Scriptures.<a name=382:3></a> When we come to the New Testament we have the parable of a king making a marriage for his son, alluding to this very thing.<a name=382:4></a> The wife is not in evidence, the bride is not in evidence, in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#22">Matthew  22</a>, but it is a parable presenting a great affair, to which certain were invited, and it confirms what has been remarked, that the marriage of the Lamb, that is, Christ's marriage to the assembly, is the great thought that is in mind, and all other unions or marriages, as we speak, are in view of Christ's marriage.<a name=382:5></a> It is the one kind of marital union that abides, all others are temporary and provisional; the institution being of God, of course, but as belonging to what Scripture calls the first order, it comes to an end.<a name=382:6></a>

		"He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second" <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:9">Hebrews  10:9</a> -- that passage applies to many things -- it applies to marriage.<a name=382:7></a> The "second" is a great spiritual and abiding thought, and, as I said, it is what should arise in our minds particularly just now, especially in the minds of our dear brother and sister, as lifting them out of the first, as I may say, so as to establish the second in their minds.<a name=382:8></a> For unless the

		second is established in their minds, they will not grace the first.<a name=383:1></a> The first continues on outwardly, but it has become degraded among men; christianity and the teaching of our Lord have lifted it up to its proper setting.<a name=383:2></a> It is to be retained in that setting amongst those who love Him and keep His commandments; and indeed the retaining of it according to His thought is a part of the testimony at the present time, for the idea has become degraded among the heathen, especially in the east -- it has a greater place in the west.<a name=383:3></a> No doubt God intended governmentally to preserve it in the western countries (of which these dominions are an outgrowth) in view of the testimony.<a name=383:4></a> Indeed the idea of marriage was to prepare material for the assembly, for that is what God had in mind from the very beginning, but degradation has come into the western countries dreadfully and it is a feature of the testimony that the institution of marriage should be preserved, even as the Lord lifted it up in His teaching to its own setting.<a name=383:5></a> He said in relation to divorce, "From the beginning it was not so".<a name=383:6></a> <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#19:8">Matthew  19:8</a>.<a name=383:7></a> The Lord lifts the institution of marriage into its own divine setting, and it is only in spiritual hands that it can be carried through and maintained there.<a name=383:8></a> Hence the importance of the matter before us, and we have this idea presented in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#19">Revelation  19</a>, that is what has been in the mind of God for all time which came in with Adam and Eve.<a name=383:9></a> God had it in mind; it was to take on spiritual character; marriage was to take on a spiritual character, and unless we understand that we are not equal to the relation as it is now.<a name=383:10></a> Indeed, unless we are married to Christ, we are not equal to marriage, we shall not be able to maintain it in its integrity, in its lustre.<a name=383:11></a> So the wife is to be a sister.<a name=383:12></a> Paul speaks about leading about a sister as wife, that means a sister in the Lord, and that marriage is to be in the Lord, not simply that the persons are to be christians, but there is to be active

		So that the idea of husband and wife is to continue, according to Revelation, but only in a spiritual sense, and it is the apprehension of that that enables us to take up the material thing as it is known now and maintain it in its integrity and lustre as a divine institution.<a name=384:7></a> What has to be noted, if we are to learn from this passage anticipatively, is that His wife, that is the Lamb's wife, is a sufferer; that is in mind -- Christ is the suffering one there.<a name=384:8></a> It is not the Lamb's <i>bride</i>, it is the Lamb's <i>wife</i>, showing that the relation of wife already exists between Christ and the assembly -- only the public celebrations are still future, but it reflects always on every marriage celebrated amongst those that are spiritual.<a name=384:9></a> What is to be noticed also is that "His wife hath made herself ready;" and what her attire is, is a matter of what is granted to her, not what she will, and in principle it is what she has got.<a name=384:10></a> "And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints".<a name=384:11></a> But she is not wearing these habiliments simply because they are hers, but because it is granted to her, showing that the idea of subjection and obedience is proper to the wife and continues on in eternity, for indeed we

		John speaks of the city -- the Lamb's wife -- and says, it is "pure gold", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21:18">Revelation  21:18</a> that is, it is wholly according to God's thought, and what flows out from that pure gold, as representing the saints, is not simply what I may yield abstractly, but what flows out from my mind as I accept God's thoughts and His working according to it.<a name=385:5></a> So that it is what is granted to her to be arrayed in what had been wrought out as accepting the position of suffering and subjection.<a name=385:6></a>

		As to the verses in Corinthians, Paul would call our attention to the fact that marriage really takes a secondary place.<a name=385:7></a> The virgins are spiritual persons, such persons as are capable of rendering undivided attention to the things of Christ, and marriage tends to detract from that.<a name=385:8></a> That is a very humbling consideration for married people, for it places them in a somewhat inferior position to those not married.<a name=385:9></a> This may not have been noticed.<a name=385:10></a> There may be assumption of superior advantage in union, whereas spiritually there is no advantage, but rather disadvantage.<a name=385:11></a> I am not saying the discipline may not yield spiritually, but we have to speak of these things as they are.<a name=385:12></a> Marriage is not productive of spirituality, it is the opposite of that; and Paul says, "The unmarried cares for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and spirit; but she that has married cares for the things of the world, how she shall please her husband".<a name=385:13></a>

		Here it is not the natural persons, it is spiritual persons, and the more spiritual we are the less we shall think of marriage as productive of spirituality.<a name=386:1></a> It may yield discipline, it does, but spirituality is one thing and discipline is another.<a name=386:2></a> So that the unmarried has the advantage, if spirituality be there.<a name=386:3></a> The marital relation does not add to it, but rather detracts from it.<a name=386:4></a> The more we understand that, the more we set our faces against the distracting element.<a name=386:5></a> It belongs to the "first" and it is against spirituality.<a name=386:6></a> It will have to be watched or it will interfere with spirituality.<a name=386:7></a> If it be watched and understood and accepted, then the discipline that goes with it helps us, but in itself discipline is not spirituality.<a name=386:8></a> It is not that I want to discourage our dear young brother and sister, but it is well for them to understand these things -- the relative value of the married state as compared with the unmarried state.<a name=386:9></a> Spiritually the unmarried has the advantage, and to see these things everything has to be understood in the abstract; if we see their abstract relation and value, then we learn how to behave and how to regard things, and we are not deceived.<a name=386:10></a>

		So the verses, you will observe, say, "But I would have you without carefulness.<a name=386:11></a> He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord".<a name=386:12></a> That does not mean obviously that every unmarried brother and sister is caring for the things of the Lord <i>because</i> they are unmarried.<a name=386:13></a> We have to look at it in its spiritual setting.<a name=386:14></a> There is Paul; he is an unmarried man.<a name=386:15></a> His idea is that he has got the advantage spiritually.<a name=386:16></a> And then it goes on to say, "He that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife".<a name=386:17></a> A wife may say, 'My husband is not governed by pleasing me',
