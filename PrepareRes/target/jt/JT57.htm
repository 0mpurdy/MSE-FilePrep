		What is to be noted first is the conversation between the Lord and Pilate, which we may say is peculiar to John, and it is thought it would bear particularly on the last days.<a name=1:13></a> The government as appointed by God has been greatly accentuated by events that have arisen during recent times, extending back about thirty years, and it has come into contact with the Spirit of Christ in His people.<a name=1:14></a> The Lord has been helping the saints to say what is right to them, as He Himself did, and to act accordingly in other things.<a name=1:15></a> At the outset of the origination of the gentile monarchies great events occurred.<a name=1:16></a> The history of Nebuchadnezzar is outstanding.<a name=1:17></a> God gave him to be "king of kings", and great wars were carried on by him.<a name=1:18></a> Nebuchadnezzar and his successors came into contact with God's people in Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego these

		J.T.<a name=4:8></a> That is what comes out.<a name=4:9></a> Satan had selected his instruments, it was a satanic matter; Judas had come under his power and the devil was doing his utmost, but his emissaries were powerless.<a name=4:10></a> He himself was powerless.<a name=4:11></a> Then the Lord says, "If therefore ye seek me, let these go away".<a name=4:12></a> He <i>could</i> retain His liberty, but He is going to allow them to take Him.<a name=4:13></a> He provides however for the disciples, they are to be let go.<a name=4:14></a>

		FEATURES OF THE TRUTH BEARING ON THE LAST DAYS (2)

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=11:1></a> We scarcely touched on the passages read this morning, but what was said as to the prophetic utterances of the Lord is of importance, because prophetic ministry has acquired a place amongst the brethren, and it helps us to have understanding of the times.<a name=11:2></a> What Caiaphas said in <a href="../bible/John.htm#18:14">John  18:14</a> is on the same line; he "counselled the Jews that it was better that one man should perish for the people".<a name=11:3></a> That was a prophetic word from him.<a name=11:4></a> We also noted Peter's negation of the light that came out by using a sword, and we should keep that point before us because it really enters into all that is before us at these meetings.<a name=11:5></a> The Lord told him to "put the sword into the sheath", adding, "the cup which the Father has given me, shall I not drink it?<a name=11:6></a>" (verse 11).<a name=11:7></a> There are many who correspond with Peter, notwithstanding that much light has come down from the previous war; there are those who advocate joining in with the claims of the government to the fullest extent.<a name=11:8></a> The effect of Peter's use of the sword was not remedied.<a name=11:9></a> According to John; and then he went to further extremes in denying the Lord, so that where we give way on one point we are likely to go further.<a name=11:10></a> Thus things in our day are going on to the end unremedied, and we are reminded of the danger of leading in error to an error to any extent, not knowing how far it may go.<a name=11:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.W.<a name=11:12></a>D.<a name=11:13></a> Do you think we can apply the thought of the cup, which the Father gave Him to drink, in any crisis that might be linked on with governmental difficulties?<a name=11:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=11:15></a> Quite so; the Father's will is the immediate issue.<a name=11:16></a> It is "the cup which <i>the Father</i> has given"

	<div class="paragraph">
		R.W.<a name=12:3></a>S.<a name=12:4></a> Will you enlarge on that suggestion about the ear not being healed according to John, and Peter's case being left?<a name=12:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=12:6></a> I think it is a solemn matter that the Lord just left these facts.<a name=12:7></a> At least, the Spirit of God does not record through John that the ear was healed, and Peter's denial is not pursued to its full sequel as in Luke.<a name=12:8></a> I think it is to remind us of the seriousness of any overt acts of sin, however spiritual we may have been.<a name=12:9></a> In the government of God they may be left and they may extend beyond anything we might have intended.<a name=12:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.N.<a name=12:11></a>W.<a name=12:12></a> The probing at the end of the gospel has some reference to these matters: "Lovest thou me?<a name=12:13></a>" three times repeated.<a name=12:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=12:15></a> That comes into our enquiry.<a name=12:16></a> What shall I be when I am old?<a name=12:17></a> The Lord says to Peter, "When thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and bring thee where thou dost not desire", <a href="../bible/John.htm#21:18">John  21:18</a>.<a name=12:18></a> He referred to the death he should die, that he should be a real martyr.<a name=12:19></a>

		S.J.<a name=12:20></a>H.<a name=12:21></a> Would you say a word as to why, in John, it is the kinsman of the one whose ear he cut off that raises the issue with Peter in the palace court?<a name=12:22></a> "One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?<a name=12:23></a>" -- as if he had become prominent in that way.<a name=12:24></a>

		J.T.<a name=12:25></a> Quite so.<a name=12:26></a> It would indicate that, as we have said, wrong things done may stand, and spread too.<a name=12:27></a> There is the spreading of the thought in the fact that this kinsman would notice him.<a name=12:28></a> The confessions that have been made today in regard to the truth are spreading, people are hearing things they never

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=13:9></a> It is in its sheath.<a name=13:10></a> Peter <i>had</i> it.<a name=13:11></a> The point would be that it will be used again, but the extraordinary circumstances now preclude its use.<a name=13:12></a> What Jesus calls His kingdom is a new thing come in as different from other kingdoms, and the sword is precluded from that kingdom.<a name=13:13></a> He says "My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom; if my kingdom were of this world my servants had fought that I might not be delivered up to the Jews; but now my kingdom not from hence".<a name=13:14></a> I would call it a provisional kingdom, not in keeping with the wars that were waged before Christ, and with wars that will ensue after His second coming.<a name=13:15></a> When He comes out to deal with the nations the sword will be used again: but not now.<a name=13:16></a> It is a provisional state of things, and the fact that it is such and not accredited as David's kingdom was for instance, makes it difficult for those who confess this kingdom at the present time.<a name=13:17></a> It is difficult because men do not understand it.<a name=13:18></a> I think that is why John is used of the Spirit of God to record these conversations between the Lord and Pilate.<a name=13:19></a> They have an inwardness and a depth that do not appear in the other gospels; and I believe the allusion is to

		J.T.<a name=14:5></a> I think he must have taken up literally the Lord's words in regard to the sword as spoken in Luke, and therefore used the sword.<a name=14:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.N.<a name=14:7></a>W.<a name=14:8></a> Regarding the inability to explain to men the difference between David's kingdom and the Lord's kingdom, would the best explanation be to be prepared to go to the wall?<a name=14:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=14:10></a> That is what we have to do, because our statements are highly objectionable to some; and others who would be more or less favourable cannot see the point that is made, which the Lord brings out here.<a name=14:11></a> And that is why spirituality is so essential to this matter.<a name=14:12></a> The Spirit of Christ is always a testimony.<a name=14:13></a> The Spirit of Christ is seen especially in this section of John's gospel.<a name=14:14></a> When the Lord speaks about "My kingdom" and says that His servants would fight if it were of this world, Pilate enquires, "Thou art then a king?<a name=14:15></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=14:19></a> That is another matter, and it makes a real difficulty.<a name=14:20></a> It beclouds the real issue, because these persons are not spiritual and hence do not commend the truth.<a name=14:21></a> Quakers -- Friends, as they are called in the United States and England -- have great influence in this matter.<a name=14:22></a> Governmentally they have helped, but as to the inwardness and spirituality of the truth involved, they do not understand.<a name=14:23></a>

		J.T.<a name=31:1></a> I thought we could look at the scripture before us in relation to Paul.<a name=31:2></a> It is clear that, after the Lord, he stands first in the dispensation, especially in its universal bearing, and this chapter affords opportunity to consider him in this respect in the presence of the representatives of the gentile rulers.<a name=31:3></a> The Lord said that He had taken him up in relation to them.<a name=31:4></a> He said to Ananias, "Go, for this man is an elect vessel to me, to bear my name before both nations and kings and the sons of Israel", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:15">Acts  9:15</a>.<a name=31:5></a> It mentions nations first, and then kings.<a name=31:6></a> This is in accord with Simeon's prophetic word: "a light for revelation of the Gentiles" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:32">Luke  2:32</a>), meaning that they were brought into evidence for blessing.<a name=31:7></a> The original word 'revelation' means 'unveiling'; there had been a veil over them, but now they are brought into distinct evidence, being unveiled through Christ.<a name=31:8></a> And Paul is the servant to be used particularly in this, so that he certainly has the first place after the Lord in our consideration.<a name=31:9></a> He is an example for us of service and conduct before gentiles and their rulers.<a name=31:10></a> He is a model.<a name=31:11></a> But then it should be also noted that this chapter contemplates that the apostle had been wanting in recent movements, insisting on going to Jerusalem, whereas his ministry was to be towards the gentiles.<a name=31:12></a> So that the position fits with our own times which are marked by the Lord coming in to take matters in hand Himself, the ministry in the hands of others having generally failed.<a name=31:13></a> Mark has this in mind, recording in his last chapter want of faith in the disciples, the leading ones particularly, so that the Lord had to take the matter in hand Himself and readjust the

		J.T.<a name=54:7></a> Yes.<a name=54:8></a> He takes the lead in relation to the eleven, what the Lord left here, His handiwork.<a name=54:9></a> But Peter links on with Paul in chapter 10; that is, not formally, but in his ministry; although it is remarkable that Paul went up to see Peter after he was converted and remained a certain time with him, as if there was at once a spiritual link between them.<a name=54:10></a> But Paul as in relation to Barnabas takes the lead, not by formal appointment but by power and efficiency.<a name=54:11></a> Saul in chapter 13 is identified with Paul, and it is now "Paul and his company"; a similar comment is never made of Peter or of any of the other apostles.<a name=54:12></a> And so Paul is already in the lead in chapter 13, and in chapter 15 he is pre-eminently in the lead, that is, not by appointment, but by fact, linking on with receiving the right hands of fellowship of Peter, James and John.<a name=54:13></a> Finally in his epistle Peter formally commits himself to Paul in the ministry, and as a Scripture writer, too.<a name=54:14></a> So that I think these facts make the matter clear that Paul is outstanding, a universal minister, a person who has received ministry from the Lord personally more than once.<a name=54:15></a> Peter is stressed by the Lord as put in administration in the kingdom -- not in the assembly, but in the kingdom.<a name=54:16></a> But our point is to see the link between him and this main subject, that is, how the rulers of the world came in contact with the ministers

		J.T.<a name=73:10></a> There would be a punitive element in it, I think; however, it is to bring out certain conditions in view of the final conflict.<a name=73:11></a> It is preliminary; that is, God is not openly punitive, because it is still the period of the Spirit and of the gospel and of the assembly, so that I think there is a certain modification; but at the same time these terrible throes that we are in and have been in more or less for a quarter of a century, point to what is final.<a name=73:12></a> I think John's ministry is being used to help us in these circumstances in bringing about the brotherly side in the ministry.<a name=73:13></a> In the history of the assembly the ministry took on the lordly attitude in the earlier Episcopalian systems, including Rome; and to some extent in other systems it has taken on a lordly attitude; whereas John's ministry brings in the <i>brethren</i>, and the ministers express brotherly feelings in suffering with all the saints.<a name=73:14></a> I think here it is preliminary.<a name=73:15></a> We shall not be here in the actual

		to this matter, as to whether the brethren can take on this thought of John the beloved, the disciple whom Jesus loved.<a name=90:1></a> Here he is in the isle of Patmos, and he is speaking of being "in the Spirit on the Lord's day".<a name=90:2></a> The Spirit of God is making much of that, keeping that before us; this expression is used only here.<a name=90:3></a> The same is true of the expression, "the Lord's supper"; it is the same idea as to the Lord.<a name=90:4></a> The apostle has that in mind and surely the Lord has blessed it to us.<a name=90:5></a> Then he is "fellow-partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and patience, in Jesus"; this is the brother that we are going to learn from in this book.<a name=90:6></a> The Lord tells him in the end of the first chapter the order in which he is to write the book.<a name=90:7></a> We are to follow that and to see where chapter 10 belongs and how far we have the idea of it already.<a name=90:8></a> But certainly this matter of the sea, to which the Lord asserts His rights, ought to enter into our prayers so that we might again visit our brethren overseas.<a name=90:9></a> The sea tends to isolation.<a name=90:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish to speak of a well-known subject, that is, the believer's household, and for this I have selected this scripture in 1 Chronicles, which is largely a book of believer's households.<a name=95:1></a> It is rightly named Chronicles, and was undoubtedly written by one who was a householder.<a name=95:2></a> At any rate he was used by the Spirit to write about households; not as if he were to take up a directory in a city and pick out the names alphabetically, Scripture never moves on that principle; it takes account of the children of God, and any scriptural chroniclers have them in view.<a name=95:3></a> Hence many must be omitted in any such chronicle or census that may be made.<a name=95:4></a> God works on the principle of sovereign selection.<a name=95:5></a> We are regarded thus as the elect of God, which is not merely that we profess Christianity, but that we belong to the elect of God chosen before the foundation of the world; as if God looked down the ages and picked out the elect and named them, and then writes about them, speaks about their distinctiveness.<a name=95:6></a> Chronicles is a book of that kind, a book of families.<a name=95:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not written even on the principle of the firstborn; it is written on the principle of election.<a name=95:8></a> It is true, indeed, that the first man, Adam, heads the list, which would mean that although he was the first male sinner -- not the first sinner, but the first male sinner -- he is regarded by God as one of us, worthy of mention, worthy of heading the list.<a name=95:9></a> And so on the principle of election we have David coming in early.<a name=95:10></a> God has a right to select David, to write about him before He does about others who chronologically would come first, and He does so.<a name=95:11></a> But He also writes about Joseph, and I have read verses that speak about Joseph's family, that is, that part of it which comes under the head of Ephraim.<a name=95:12></a> I

		want to make some remarks that I do not think will be wholly new, but I do think they will be practical.<a name=96:1></a> If we have not got families we belong to families; and if we do not belong to the divine family, God would desire to put us into it, because the matter is still open, the book is not yet closed.<a name=96:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So I have some remarks to make on the divine selection here of Ephraim, who had calamity in his house.<a name=96:3></a> The word "evil" here is "calamity".<a name=96:4></a> It says of his son that "he called his name Beriah, for he was born when calamity was in his house", <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#7:23">1 Chronicles  7:23</a>.<a name=96:5></a> This was the son Ephraim's wife bore after the others were slain (verse 21).<a name=96:6></a> There are very few houses among us that have not experienced calamity, and these verses I hope will show that this matter in each of our houses, whether great or small, as taken to heart and taken up with God is going to result in enlargement.<a name=96:7></a> That is what is recorded for us in these verses down to the last son mentioned, namely, Joshua.<a name=96:8></a> They show that this house which had calamity in it took the matter up with God and found God and became enlarged, not in the sense of money or of man's learning, but in the sense of families.<a name=96:9></a> Race suicide is not according to God; any endeavour toward race suicide is foreign to God.<a name=96:10></a> God's thought is, "Be fruitful and multiply: swarm on the earth, and multiply on it", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#9:7">Genesis  9:7</a>.<a name=96:11></a> That was said to the first man and wife.<a name=96:12></a> And so the increase here is in families.<a name=96:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God is thinking of persons, not of the area of the globe.<a name=96:14></a> It is a small planet, a small part of the system, one of the smallest I understand, so that God is not thinking of that.<a name=96:15></a> He is not thinking of land or of the seas or the mountains or the lakes, or even of the number of the stars, although they afford great variety which God takes notice of.<a name=96:16></a> "Star differs from star in glory"; that is a remarkable thing, God surely has some meaning in that.<a name=96:17></a> The stars refer to persons

		typically.<a name=97:1></a> But He is not thinking of the heavenly bodies, save as part of His creation; they will come to an end really, the heavens and the earth will disappear; that is, those that now are.<a name=97:2></a> There will be new heavens and a new earth presently.<a name=97:3></a> But these bodies are there evidently to symbolize persons, those persons whom God had in mind before the creation of the stars or the heavens.<a name=97:4></a> So that the things that are made are not made of the things that do appear.<a name=97:5></a> We cannot tell just what they are made of; scientists cannot succeed in finding out all these things.<a name=97:6></a> But we know that God framed the worlds by His word; it does not say in that connection by His power, but by His word, meaning that His mind was in it.<a name=97:7></a> He is not telling us everything; indeed we do not need to know everything, especially when we know that they are going to disappear.<a name=97:8></a> We are concerned about persons, those that are to remain, those that are eternal.<a name=97:9></a> They are to remain in the sense of families, for we read of "every family"; God is the Father of every family.<a name=97:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So I am now speaking of Joseph's family, that is, Ephraim's branch of it.<a name=97:11></a> As I said, there is calamity in his house.<a name=97:12></a> It is a calamitous time; the world is full of calamities and they are not existent without God; not one of them has happened without God.<a name=97:13></a> Not a sparrow falls without Him; that is very comforting.<a name=97:14></a> So the calamities, if they fall on a Christian's household, do not happen accidentally at all, they happen by God, or at least by His knowledge.<a name=97:15></a> There are very grave ones, very sorrowful ones in houses, and that is why I have taken up Ephraim's house.<a name=97:16></a> We are told that he had been specially selected by God; he was put before his brother.<a name=97:17></a> Joseph did not wish it, another than Joseph wished it, and God used another, namely his father, to make the preference and to elevate Ephraim above Manasseh.<a name=97:18></a> Jacob was the one who did it.<a name=97:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		That brings up much as to this family of which Joseph was the immediate head.<a name=98:1></a> In this book of Chronicles the families are subdivided, usually with heads.<a name=98:2></a> As you go over these names that I have read, you cannot think of them as all the sons of one man; they are his posterity, and in that sense his sons.<a name=98:3></a> Joseph had a great family history, a persecuted history; from the time he was seventeen years of age he was persecuted by his brothers.<a name=98:4></a> I do not believe any brother or sister, any man or woman who faithfully serves Christ evades persecution from his relatives; and no one experienced it more than Joseph.<a name=98:5></a> It continued for a long time too.<a name=98:6></a> His story is most interesting and profitable, because he is a type of Christ, the true Joseph.<a name=98:7></a> But eventually he was raised to the supreme place in Egypt, next to Pharaoh, so that he had a most exalted history, as well as, for a short time, a most outwardly degraded one.<a name=98:8></a> Ultimately he was raised to the position of second in the kingdom, and in that position he got a wife who bore him two children.<a name=98:9></a> One of these was Ephraim.<a name=98:10></a> He was born in Egypt and brought up there, as also his brother Manasseh, for Joseph remained in Egypt.<a name=98:11></a> He died there, and his generations, possibly most of those that I read of here, were also in Egypt.<a name=98:12></a> But they were, at least typically, of the family of God in Egypt, preserved there so that not a hair of their heads perished; showing that although we are in the world, we are not of it, and we are preserved in it as Christians.<a name=98:13></a> And so immediately Ephraim is born we are told his name, and that it means 'fruitfulness'.<a name=98:14></a> It really means 'double fruitfulness'.<a name=98:15></a> Of course it was prophetic.<a name=98:16></a> It is not like the ordinary names of men; the names given to God's people in Old Testament times were usually prophetic.<a name=98:17></a> It is simple to understand that a person who is foreknown of God before the foundation of the world is going to get some

		prophetic reference as he is born.<a name=99:1></a> God has a name for him, and the name discloses the circumstances of his birth; but then, it is also prophetic.<a name=99:2></a> So Ephraim means 'double fruitfulness'.<a name=99:3></a> Well, that child must be watched and nurtured; God wills that that boy shall be elevated.<a name=99:4></a> And so in due time he was; he was put before Manasseh in spite of his father, showing how God over-rules fathers sometimes.<a name=99:5></a> We may claim rights in our children, but God says, I have rights in your children as well.<a name=99:6></a> So that we cannot regard them as we wish, we must regard them as God wishes.<a name=99:7></a> God put Ephraim before Manasseh, and all this must enter into the future history running down; it runs down to one of the greatest men in the Old Testament: that is Joshua.<a name=99:8></a> He is the last one mentioned here, Joshua the son of Nun.<a name=99:9></a> These are things of importance about Ephraim, and also about Joseph, although he was not without failure, which God did not allow to pass.<a name=99:10></a> He made a great failure in this matter of Ephraim, much greater than the surface would disclose.<a name=99:11></a> But though -he lived and died in Egypt, there is no evidence that he ever lost ground there, but rather the opposite; he gained there.<a name=99:12></a> He died in Egypt and was put into a coffin there; an ark it was really.<a name=99:13></a> He was a family man; he lived one hundred and ten years, and the grandchildren of Manasseh were born on his knees -- a very remarkable thing.<a name=99:14></a> He must have been a man of great affections to have time to lend his knees for that purpose.<a name=99:15></a> You may say, A grandfather would be likely to have affection; but Joseph had children born on his knees; and it is said in the last chapter of Genesis that he saw Ephraim's children of the third generation.<a name=99:16></a> He saw them and valued them, not exactly because of their number but because of their quality.<a name=99:17></a> Now Ephraim was elevated by God in this family, but at the time of which we are speaking there was

		I wish to speak about <i>liberty</i>, liberty wherewith Christ sets His people free.<a name=106:1></a> We may possess it and yet be hindered in it by external circumstances.<a name=106:2></a> If the enemy cannot rob us of the liberty in principle, he may rob us of the enjoyment of it.<a name=106:3></a> I wish to speak of the enjoyment of it, continuing even although there may be external pressure that the enemy would use to hinder us in it.<a name=106:4></a> It has cost the Lord much that we should have it.<a name=106:5></a> He died in order that we should have it.<a name=106:6></a> Many were in bondage because of fear of death, and it may be so now.<a name=106:7></a> All their lifetime, we read, they were subject to bondage through the fear of death, but Christ abolished death.<a name=106:8></a> It cost Him His life to do that, that through death He might destroy him who had the might of death to deliver those who all their lifetime were subject to bondage through fear of death.<a name=106:9></a> I just touch on that; doubtless most of us have had the experience of it, but not, surely, through the whole of our lives until now; that would not be characteristic of a Christian.<a name=106:10></a> It was characteristic of those who belonged to God before Christ died, but certainly not since; nor should any true believer in Christ have the fear of death nor any bondage connected with that fear.<a name=106:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As I said, it cost the Lord His life to liberate us from the fear of death, and it has cost the Spirit, too, something to liberate us; for our liberty is in the Spirit and we are to stand fast in it.<a name=106:12></a> It is only by the Spirit we can do so.<a name=106:13></a> We are to stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ has set us free; He has set us free in freedom, a most precious designation of the great fact of our liberty.<a name=106:14></a> But as I was saying, it has cost Christ His life; and it has cost the Spirit

	<div class="paragraph">
		something too to maintain us in liberty.<a name=107:1></a> Then it has cost us ourselves something, for there must be some correspondence in us, dear brethren, to what it cost divine Persons to secure any given thing for us; and that correspondence comes about through light as to the thing itself that causes fear, whatever it may be, whether death or bondage to the world or any other matter.<a name=107:2></a> Light comes to us and the Spirit operates in us in relation to that light.<a name=107:3></a> Without the Spirit light would fade.<a name=107:4></a> With the possession of the Spirit, light normally does not fade; it shines brighter and brighter until the day be fully come.<a name=107:5></a> That is through the Spirit operating in the believer.<a name=107:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so I have undertaken tonight in the scriptures read to speak of liberty, preservation in liberty from any external circumstances; chiefly governmental ones, but also persecutional.<a name=107:7></a> The first scripture read, that is, <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#12">2 Corinthians  12</a>, treats of governmental circumstances which cause bondage in those who should be in liberty.<a name=107:8></a> The apostle Paul serves us well in many respects, but in this respect especially, that he is a model for Christians.<a name=107:9></a> He is a model of Christianity in its varied forms.<a name=107:10></a> He became affected by governmental circumstances though he was an apostle, and these scriptures show that the circumstances would tend to rob him of his liberty, the liberty which he had in Christ and which he valued, and of which he has taught us much.<a name=107:11></a> In speaking of models, the Lord Jesus is, of course, the Model of everything that is of God in the Christian.<a name=107:12></a> It is so as to liberty.<a name=107:13></a> Thus we read in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#12">Matthew  12</a>that He went on the Sabbath day through the cornfields.<a name=107:14></a> We are not told just why He did it, but He did it.<a name=107:15></a> We know now why He did it: He wished to set an example to His disciples of liberty from legality, from worthless legality.<a name=107:16></a> He wished them to be free to use the creation of God as needed.<a name=107:17></a> He created everything; He made the

		corn to grow, and there was the field of corn growing; it was usable, and the Lord went into the field and walked through it.<a name=108:1></a> He did not eat the corn; He did not pluck it; He intended to liberate the disciples.<a name=108:2></a> They were hungry, and they were not to suffer from hunger because it was the Sabbath.<a name=108:3></a> The Lord tells us in that connection that the Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath; therefore it is not intended to deprive those who are of faith; to rob them of the creation, of the blessing, of the fulness of the earth.<a name=108:4></a> The earth is the Lord's, we are told, and the fulness thereof.<a name=108:5></a> So the Lord walked through the cornfield; He did not pluck the corn, but His disciples did.<a name=108:6></a> He did not tell them to do it; He did not tell them to walk through the cornfield, but He intended them to do it.<a name=108:7></a> Though He did not tell them to pluck the corn, they took the liberty of doing it and so did more than He did; they plucked the ears of corn and rubbed them in their hands and ate them.<a name=108:8></a> That is what the Lord intended.<a name=108:9></a> He intended that they should be in liberty to that extent; that is, He intended to indicate that the fruit of the earth may be availed of without legal restriction.<a name=108:10></a> There are those that do not eat meat on Friday; that is a legal restriction in which there is no value whatever; it robs a creature of God of what God has provided to support his life.<a name=108:11></a> There are many other illustrations of damaging legal bondage, but the Lord illustrates the liberty He would have us to enjoy.<a name=108:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so Paul enjoyed that liberty, as well as many other Christians.<a name=108:13></a> The Lord used Paul to unfold this matter in the epistle to the Galatians.<a name=108:14></a> But when we come to this governmental matter that I have read of in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#12">2 Corinthians  12</a>the apostle is in danger of being inflated.<a name=108:15></a> He was, after all, a man like ourselves, as is said of Elijah, "a man of like passions to us", <a href="../bible/James.htm#5:17">James  5:17</a>.<a name=108:16></a> The Lord never was.<a name=108:17></a> He never

		That is the point I had in mind in reading this whole section: "And that I might not be exalted".<a name=110:6></a> You will notice, as I have already pointed out, the stress he lays on truth.<a name=110:7></a> What he said was the truth; he calls God to witness that it was the truth.<a name=110:8></a> Let no one quibble or question the verity of the statements here as to Paul's exaltation; it was as high as the third heaven, and it was in paradise.<a name=110:9></a> Whether in the body or out of it he did not know, but it was so; personally he was there.<a name=110:10></a> So that now I come to my point: "And that I might not be exalted".<a name=110:11></a> This is a governmental matter, and it is a most solemn matter, that such a man as Paul -- the great apostle Paul -- should be subject or made subject to governmental suffering: to a thorn for the flesh, a messenger of Satan, he calls it, an emissary of the devil.<a name=110:12></a> As one might say, God took this emissary out of Satan's hand to use it against Paul for the moment, so that he might be saved from talking about himself or his exceptionalness in the service of God; about the fact that he, and only he, was caught up so high, caught up to the third heaven and into paradise.<a name=110:13></a> There are the two things: one is as far as the third heaven, and the other is into paradise.<a name=110:14></a> He was actually in the place called paradise.<a name=110:15></a>

		So in the third epistle of John we have this same word, "prosper".<a name=128:10></a> It is written to the special brother, Gaius, "whom", says the apostle, "I love in truth".<a name=128:11></a> You can see how authoritative persons such as I have been speaking of single out persons who are lovable, lovable as in the truth.<a name=128:12></a> The apostle goes on to say immediately about this brother, that he desires his prosperity in all things.<a name=128:13></a> The Darby Translation says, "Beloved, I desire that in all things thou shouldest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospers".<a name=128:14></a> Now here it is not simply a matter of making money, making a bigger salary, but that in all things I may prosper and be in health as my soul prospers.<a name=128:15></a> So that we have another point of view, as to a brother who loves the truth and is

		These verses contain the thought of "going forth" in keeping with the teaching of the epistle to the Hebrews, from which I have read, in which Christians are largely regarded as having settled down in earthly circumstances -- in general, religious ones, but still earthly; that is, settling down short of the heavenly calling.<a name=133:1></a> The Lord is said to be seated in heaven, although at the same time ready to serve; Stephen saw Him as "the Son of man standing at the right hand of God", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7:56">Acts  7:56</a>.<a name=133:2></a> The heavens were opened to him, and according to this epistle they were opened to the Jewish believers of that time.<a name=133:3></a> Hebrews has been called 'The book of the opened heavens', so that the writer tells us in chapter 2: 9 that "we see Jesus .<a name=133:4></a>.<a name=133:5></a>.<a name=133:6></a> crowned with glory and honour".<a name=133:7></a> The Jewish believers at that time had the greatest opportunities in such ministry as the twelve afforded, men with apostolic authority and apostolic ability, the Spirit coming in and leading them on, so that they ministered in such power that even the Spirit Himself depicts the result, not only in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>but later.<a name=133:8></a> The ministry was maintained, and these Hebrew believers are enjoined to remember their leaders who had at that time spoken to them the word of God.<a name=133:9></a> Then there were others still continuing the same holy service, whom they were to obey.<a name=133:10></a> So we have these significant words in chapter 11 as to Joseph: "By faith Joseph when dying called to mind the going forth of the sons of Israel".<a name=133:11></a> "The going forth" -- the phrase is to be noted as characteristic of Hebrews, which is spiritual enlargement, illustrated in many phrases such as, "Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling" (chapter 3: 1).<a name=133:12></a> So that faith is addressed in this book,

		J.T.<a name=184:1></a> No doubt the brethren will bear in mind the remarks made in our previous reading with regard to chapters 5 and 6, and how the idea of a system is confirmed and seen operating effectively.<a name=184:2></a> We finished yesterday by reading chapter 7, verse 1, "And Jehovah said to Moses, See, I have made thee God to Pharaoh; and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet".<a name=184:3></a> This passage is a striking confirmation of what has been said about the system that God had inaugurated in type in Egypt, the antitype being His present operations through the gospel for the deliverance of His people out of the world.<a name=184:4></a> He keeps Himself before us representatively here in the type.<a name=184:5></a> He said to Moses, "I have made thee God to Pharaoh; and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet".<a name=184:6></a> Moses would thus be representative of God, not made 'a god', but made "God to Pharaoh".<a name=184:7></a> Thus God can be represented.<a name=184:8></a> The evidence of this in the antitype refers to Christ being God, being a divine Person, being Deity in Himself, not merely by appointment (Moses' place is by appointment), but in actual fact; He is a divine Person who has part in the Godhead, but is known as Man down here.<a name=184:9></a> In Colossians it is said, "For in him all the fulness of the Godhead was pleased to dwell" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:19">Colossians  1:19</a>).<a name=184:10></a> Then in chapter 2 it says, "For in him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:9">Colossians  2:9</a>).<a name=184:11></a> So that what was in type in Egypt gives a complete representation of God, and this is seen operatively in the verses read: "And Jehovah said to Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened: he refuseth to let the people go.<a name=184:12></a> Go unto Pharaoh in the morning -- behold, he will go out unto the water -- and take thy stand by the bank of the river in front of him; and take in thy hand the staff

		J.T.<a name=185:10></a> Well, I suppose Moses' position in chapter 4 is typical, being representative of Jehovah.<a name=185:11></a> "And he shall speak for thee unto the people; and it shall come to pass that he shall be to thee for a mouth, and thou shalt be to him for God".<a name=185:12></a> There it would be 'instead of' or 'for', more qualifying the God set out in Moses; but in chapter 7 it is, "I have made thee God", not simply 'for' or 'instead of', but God Himself.<a name=185:13></a> The full thought would be there, and what Moses would do would be, as it were, final.<a name=185:14></a> It would be God operating.<a name=185:15></a> The former is somewhat modified and yet the same idea runs through both.<a name=185:16></a> Colossians is the antitype, the full idea that Christ is God.<a name=185:17></a> He said, "He that has seen me has seen the Father", <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:9">John  14:9</a>.<a name=185:18></a> That did not mean that the Father was there, save as one divine Person seen representatively in Another, and therefore the Son's position would be mediatorial.<a name=185:19></a> But in Colossians it is "all the fulness of the Godhead bodily"; that is not mediatorial, it is really Deity in Christ.<a name=185:20></a> In the first chapter it is "the fulness" without saying

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=208:1></a> Our subject is the divine system as set out typically in the book of Exodus, operating there for the deliverance of Israel out of Egypt, and operating today for the deliverance of God's people out of the world.<a name=208:2></a> We noted particularly in our previous readings the component parts of the system -- Moses and Aaron in chapter 4, and in chapter 6 the personnel or elements enlarged on in the increase in the priestly family.<a name=208:3></a> Love was noted as entering into the system, seen in Moses and Aaron being brothers, and particularly in Aaron as being a man of affection.<a name=208:4></a> Aaron had the second place although he was older than Moses by three years; he was therefore at a certain disadvantage, which love would enable him to overcome; and in general it did overcome, although there was a certain rivalry seen later, not only between him and Moses but between him and Miriam and Moses.<a name=208:5></a> That is to say, Aaron and Miriam took issue with Moses in the spirit of rivalry, but love prevailed so that the service proceeded.<a name=208:6></a> We noted how the combined services of Moses and Aaron led to worship in the people in chapter 4.<a name=208:7></a> We see it here again in verse 27 of chapter 12, as Moses outlined the passover: "Ye shall say, It is a sacrifice of passover to Jehovah, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt when he smote the Egyptians and delivered our houses.<a name=208:8></a> And the people bowed their heads and worshipped".<a name=208:9></a>

		the divine side.<a name=215:1></a> Verse 10 begins an exhortation.<a name=215:2></a> Paul comes down to actual facts involving division among them, "Now I exhort you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all say the same thing, and that there be not among you divisions" Where all the members have each its own place they make a whole, and those who have broken away are to be restored to the one complete whole by his word.<a name=215:3></a> And so the apostle proceeds, "But that ye be perfectly united in the same mind and in the same opinion.<a name=215:4></a> For it has been shown to me concerning you, my brethren, by those of the house of Chloe, that there are strifes among you.<a name=215:5></a> But I speak of this, that each of you says, <i>I</i> am of Paul, and <i>I</i> of Apollos, and <i>I</i> of Cephas, and <i>I</i> of Christ.<a name=215:6></a> Is the Christ divided?<a name=215:7></a> has Paul been crucified for you?<a name=215:8></a> or have ye been baptised unto the name of Paul?<a name=215:9></a> I thank God that I have baptised none of you, unless Crispus and Gaius, that no one may say that I have baptised unto my own name.<a name=215:10></a> Yes, I baptised also the house of Stephanas; for the rest I know not if I have baptised any other.<a name=215:11></a> For Christ has not sent me to baptise, but to preach glad tidings".<a name=215:12></a> Now this passage confirms what we have said, that divisions existed in the meeting and Paul brings in the matter of baptism.<a name=215:13></a> In relation to that, he says that he has baptised certain brethren and also the house of Stephanas.<a name=215:14></a> In his ministry baptism had a place, but in it Paul had the assembly in mind; the households of the saints are intended to contribute to the assembly; and this typical chapter that we have before us in Exodus is constitutional, to build them up in the truth and last throughout the dispensation in view of the children.<a name=215:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=338:1></a> I was thinking of the idea of man, and I thought John's gospel would be the feature that we might look into now.<a name=338:2></a> The truth as to man is introduced in John in the passages read.<a name=338:3></a> The subject of man is brought in early, as most of us know, in the Scriptures, but perhaps we have not observed that no other beings are specifically mentioned at the outset; that is, in the first chapter of Genesis.<a name=338:4></a> The mind is impressed with the fact that so much is made of man at such a late date, because evidently the greater part of <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>is late, relative to the first verse of the chapter: "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth".<a name=338:5></a> What follows throughout the chapter is comparatively recent, and it is surely a matter to strike the mind that it is so, that so much is made of man, not, indeed, in that chapter, but in view of all that follows.<a name=338:6></a> Verse 26 says that "God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion".<a name=338:7></a> Surely God meant to impress us with the importance of this feature, and John takes the subject up in his own peculiar way, and tells us that in the Lord Jesus, the Word, was life and that the life was the light of men; and then tells us a little about the light.<a name=338:8></a> It is a great theme throughout John, and how man alone was in mind in the thought of the light.<a name=338:9></a> The Lord takes the matter up peculiarly in chapter 17 in His prayer, saying, "Those that thou gayest me I have kept", and, "I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gayest me out of the world.<a name=338:10></a> Thine they were, and thou gayest them me; and they have kept thy word".<a name=338:11></a> He had kept them; but I am thinking now of the fact that they

		were given -- a special set of men -- men viewed by the Lord in a peculiar way as given to Him by the Father.<a name=339:1></a> So the question is why the subject should be specialised in John, why that being -- man -- is given by the Father to the Lord Jesus.<a name=339:2></a> How he is regarded throughout Scripture of course is an immense thing; the Spirit of God is engaged with it, making all other beings, except the divine Persons, subservient.<a name=339:3></a> At such a time as the present, in which man is regarded so cheaply and used merely for the will of man himself, as aspiring and violent, we should be impressed that he is so introduced and treated of in John's gospel, and we should learn what there is for us as to him in the abstract -- for that is the way it has to be looked at; and then how the truth is worked out as to him.<a name=339:4></a> The Lord speaks in a prayerful sense to the Father and stresses the thought of man, that the Father has given certain men to Him.<a name=339:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=340:8></a> Yes.<a name=340:9></a> He says, "I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gayest me"; that is, the Lord comes to that point that the Father had given Him men.<a name=340:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=340:14></a> Well, the idea of usability runs through from the first time it is mentioned that man is to have dominion, and the being is contemplated in a dual sense; that is, male and female.<a name=340:15></a> That must have a great place with us as to usability and what the Lord would have in mind as to the men the Father had given Him.<a name=340:16></a> It really is the issue abroad, and the question is whether it is obtaining amongst the brethren and whether what is obtaining amongst us will bear fruit, will be a testimony.<a name=340:17></a>

		W.C.<a name=340:18></a> You used the expression, "a special set of men"; that was exclusive of Judas but inclusive of Peter.<a name=340:19></a> Is there anything in that as to what is happening in those who are apparently taken up?<a name=340:20></a> There were eleven and they had had that experience.<a name=340:21></a> A special sense of mercy would be found with them as retained by the Lord and definitely named as those given to Him.<a name=340:22></a>

		J.T.<a name=345:10></a> That is a good scripture to help us in what we are saying; "to present every man perfect in Christ".<a name=345:11></a> It would help us as to Paul's work, the administration that God had put into his hands.<a name=345:12></a> He makes much of it himself, that the saints might know what it was, and it is that every man should be presented perfect in Christ.<a name=345:13></a> Ephesians brings out that the gifts are given from above the heavens, to work out the truth of the assembly and man, for the assembly is formed of men.<a name=345:14></a> Hence the position the assembly has in Revelation, the ultimate position it has enters into all this, what man is capable of, what material he is in the hands of God in working out what is to His pleasure.<a name=345:15></a> Then there is the idea of the man and the woman, the male and female thought, what possibilities there were at the outset and seen now in Christ and the assembly.<a name=345:16></a> The apostle says, "<i>I</i> speak as to Christ, and as to the assembly"; that seems to be the theme that God is stressing, Christ and the assembly; that is, it is a question of man, what God has made out of him.<a name=345:17></a>

		Rem.<a name=346:6></a> We have connected somewhat the thought of what is feminine as for the heart of Christ; you are thinking of the saints as composed of men and women as for the pleasure of God.<a name=346:7></a> So the assembly viewed femininely provides an answer for the heart of Christ, but Christ and the assembly viewed together is what you have in mind to stress in the thought of man.<a name=346:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=346:9></a> The full divine thought.<a name=346:10></a> We get the female side for instance in John in Mary herself; she missed it at the first but she was subject afterwards.<a name=346:11></a> We have also the woman of Samaria; she says, "Sir, I see that thou art a prophet".<a name=346:12></a> The Lord calls her "Woman".<a name=346:13></a> So the subject runs through in John, and when we come to chapter 20 we are touching the divine thought, the Father and the Son.<a name=346:14></a> So the Lord is seen in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>as waiting till a certain thing developed.<a name=346:15></a> Certain things developed in Peter and John, but they went to their own home.<a name=346:16></a> But the woman was there, Mary Magdalene, and we are told certain things about her.<a name=346:17></a> But the Lord calls her "Mary", she had that name, and now she, turning round, says to Him, "Rabboni", which means Teacher.<a name=346:18></a> I think that is where the matter stands, the feminine thing in John -- belonging to man, but the feminine idea fully expressed, for the word Mary implies something in the way of suffering or bitterness which develops something that is suitable for the assembly, and she calls the Lord "Rabboni".<a name=346:19></a> Why is that?<a name=346:20></a> It is clear that she valued

		J.T.<a name=371:1></a> I have in mind the Lord maintaining direct links with the brethren in the assembly during the period of His absence.<a name=371:2></a> Christianity, or the assembly, is not simply, as it were, set up alone, and left to itself, or even left to the Holy Spirit, but the Lord Jesus, the Son, comes and maintains connections with it.<a name=371:3></a> The same thing is seen in the universe.<a name=371:4></a> It was not simply drawn up, and left to work itself out, to maintain itself.<a name=371:5></a> God keeps on with it and maintains it.<a name=371:6></a> The Father is "over all, and through all, and in us all".<a name=371:7></a> So these scriptures are read to call attention to the fact that this is in accord with the Lord's way when He was here in the flesh.<a name=371:8></a> It is said in the same scripture we have already read that He came in and went out amongst them, from the baptism of John until the day in which He was taken up.<a name=371:9></a> The disciples were not left to themselves at all, for the Lord maintained constant links with them, coming in and going out amongst them from the baptism of John; that is, from the time He was anointed, until He went up to heaven, and so He continues coming in and going out of the assembly now in a spiritual way, involving much as to ministry and growth and freshness.<a name=371:10></a> John's gospel bears particularly on this side.<a name=371:11></a> It is seen in the verse read in chapter 14: "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you".<a name=371:12></a>

		J.T.<a name=402:1></a> These scriptures speak of encouragement and establishment.<a name=402:2></a> Nine or ten times in the first chapter of 2 Corinthians the word "encouragement" is used, which is a matter of very great importance to us.<a name=402:3></a> The Lord has us in mind for encouragement.<a name=402:4></a> There is much discouragement, and much occasion for it, but this chapter is full of encouragement.<a name=402:5></a> Then establishment goes with it.<a name=402:6></a> Hence in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#22">Genesis  22</a>, where we have in type the resurrection of Christ, we have Abraham and his young men going to Beer-sheba, which typically implies the faithfulness of God, the well of the oath, and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.<a name=402:7></a> That is to say, God has already wrought in raising Christ from the dead, typically, when He swears to Abraham.<a name=402:8></a> It says in the New Testament "because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself, saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#6:13">Hebrews  6:13</a>, 14.<a name=402:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=413:5></a> That is what I thought.<a name=413:6></a> It is a remarkable thing that God deigns to swear, and I think it is largely to confirm young Christians, as indeed the new covenant is to confirm young Christians.<a name=413:7></a> All Christians do not need an oath from God; they believe God, as Paul did.<a name=413:8></a> All true Christians believe God, but young ones are not quite so sure, and no doubt the young element was questioning Paul here.<a name=413:9></a> So the thought is that he is in keeping with the oath of God, on which our position stands in the covenant.<a name=413:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is in my mind to speak of leadership, and to speak of it as it is seen in this book.<a name=432:4></a><a name=432:1></a> Each book of the Bible has its own significance, this book specially so.<a name=432:5></a><a name=432:2></a> It was written without a name; the name we have here is not exactly its name.<a name=432:6></a><a name=432:3></a> The significance of the book really is "in the wilderness", suggesting that the wilderness is of divine appointment, not yet blossoming "as a rose", but -- 'With thorns and briars overspread, Where foes and snares abound' (<a href=".<a name=432:7></a>.<a name=432:8></a>\hymns\hymns1972.<a name=432:9></a>htm#151:2">Hymn 151</a>).<a name=432:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The book, whilst indicating this, also indicates that it is a place of divine growth and development; that is to say, that these actual things have happened.<a name=432:11></a> The truth of manhood is in mind, the age for military service denoting that of manhood, affording a great field for promotion.<a name=432:12></a> Numbers is a book of this kind, and hence the Spirit of God in the prophets indicates that God had appeared and that the people had been brought through, for the prophets always afford light, sidelights as I might say, on the Pentateuch.<a name=432:13></a> The people were found in the wilderness, but they were taken under God's wing, borne upon it, indeed, as He says, "I have borne you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself".<a name=432:14></a> So these words were spoken in the wilderness, that is to say, after the Red Sea had been crossed.<a name=432:15></a> God was, as it were, rejoicing inwardly, for He said things in His heart; He knows the way to speak things in His heart without saying them aloud.<a name=432:16></a> In this case He spoke things aloud: "I have borne you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself".<a name=432:17></a> They settled down in the wilderness before Mount Sinai, and here God would bring out the manhood, at least in type, that had been developed.<a name=432:18></a> They had gone out by fives, meaning that there was an element of

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=433>[Page 433]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		smallness.<a name=433:1></a> The allusion is to the five senses, what we prove in ourselves.<a name=433:2></a> They had gone out by fives in military array, as an army in that sense; they had gone through the Red Sea and were brought into the very wilderness and encamped before the mount.<a name=433:3></a> Now my thought is to speak of them in type and attempt to make an application of the position.<a name=433:4></a> God had brought them through, and not simply that, but He had brought them to Himself.<a name=433:5></a> He was pleased with them.<a name=433:6></a> It was an exploit of His own, and now He would show that they were men.<a name=433:7></a> We all remember the word in the epistle to the Corinthians, an epistle in which it needed to be said, for it was hardly obvious; "Quit yourselves like men; be strong".<a name=433:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then another thing that comes out is the lesson that had to be learned; how to walk; "how ye ought to walk and to please God" (<a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#4:1">1 Thessalonians  4:1</a>); and learning to be borne; to be carried.<a name=433:9></a> We are brought together, dear brethren, and we are given to each other.<a name=433:10></a> It is a great matter that God has given Christ and the Spirit to us, but He has given the saints to us too.<a name=433:11></a> They are worthy.<a name=433:12></a> One has had considerable experience of the saints, and can say that one thinks more of them than ever; they are more lovely than ever they have been in his eyes, and I believe the same was true as to the eyes of God at Mount Sinai.<a name=433:13></a> What comes out further is that in learning to walk we are princely.<a name=433:14></a> That is why I read these passages, because they speak of princes, of persons who have that ennoblement.<a name=433:15></a> I wish to speak of the saints in their princeliness and their ennoblement, and I can say without any sentiment or natural feeling that the dear brethren have proved that they are worthy of promotion.<a name=433:16></a> I am not speaking partially of those here, but generally.<a name=433:17></a> I believe God always speaks generally of His people.<a name=433:18></a> Of course He does speak partially and speaks of them

		locally and so on, but generally the principle is what is universal and that is what is presented at Mount Sinai.<a name=434:1></a> God's people have come through, God has brought them through, and He has given us to understand that <i>He</i> has brought us through.<a name=434:2></a> I put myself amongst those who have been brought through.<a name=434:3></a> It has been one whole matter, and God would have it so.<a name=434:4></a> Presently we are all going up together and I do not believe any one of us would wish to go up otherwise.<a name=434:5></a> You might think the Lord would come and take us one by one, but He is coming to take us up together to finish the matter.<a name=434:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This all comes out at Sinai and the whole truth of the book of Numbers comes into mind.<a name=434:7></a> It involves princeliness in the brethren; that is to say, what is based on credit, what is based on what is due, for God is dealing on that principle with us.<a name=434:8></a> We are already brought, as it were, before the judgment seat of God, for surely it is due to God that we should keep and hold ourselves in the light of His presence, in the light of the presence of each other too, in the light of His operations and the promotions that are due to the people of God.<a name=434:9></a> The book of Numbers is full of the idea of promotion, promotion from the ranks, so to speak.<a name=434:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having made those remarks, I begin with the first scripture read, which involves princeliness.<a name=434:11></a> The word is, "These were the renowned of the congregation, princes of the tribes of their fathers, heads of thousands in Israel".<a name=434:12></a> These are the ones, and these have been chosen for the purpose of nominating in the ranks, of setting forward before God what there was in a military sense; that is to say, the six hundred thousand that God has.<a name=434:13></a> I refer to that because it is a question of what God has now.<a name=434:14></a> Many of us here can look back a considerable number of years and recall what there was, but I am speaking now of what there is.<a name=434:15></a> One generation passes away and

		I have in mind to speak about eternal things, having read from Paul and from Peter.<a name=455:1></a> Paul treats, as usual, of inward, heavenly things, while Peter, although not overlooking the heavenly, yet speaks of physical things, as we may say mundane things.<a name=455:2></a> He reminds us that of old the world was, as he says, overflowed with water: "by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water: whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished: but the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men".<a name=455:3></a> He deals with the physical world, particularly linking it with Noah, but careful to connect the word of God with all that happens -- an important matter.<a name=455:4></a> Even things that have recently happened, unparalleled of their kind, were not without the word.<a name=455:5></a> The word of God had -- and has -- to do with the matter.<a name=455:6></a> We may take refuge in that.<a name=455:7></a> The present heavens and the present earth are by the same word reserved unto fire.<a name=455:8></a> The word of God is governing all that is happening in physical matters; He can control them and has controlled them.<a name=455:9></a> He brought the earth out of the waters and then again engulfed it and brought it out again, all according to His word.<a name=455:10></a> So the present heavens and the present earth, whatever may be prognosticated of them, are under the hand of God.<a name=455:11></a>

		The family of Jacob is now in the test, and this question is asked: "What is your occupation?<a name=483:2></a>" How often such questions have been asked lately, both of sisters and brothers, as an agent of the government claims them, and even now governments are claiming them; how often this question comes up, "What is your occupation?<a name=483:3></a>" What I would say, dear brethren, is that we are living in a mediatorial time; the Lord Jesus is pleased to serve us as our Joseph.<a name=483:4></a> The whole matter of his brethren is set under the influence of Joseph; and our Joseph is in a mediatorial position, but particularly so in this matter of which we are speaking.<a name=483:5></a> So Joseph goes before and instructs his five brothers, whom he had chosen, as to what they should say to Pharaoh.<a name=483:6></a> How sweet it is to be chosen by the Lord in this sense!<a name=483:7></a> Joseph chose five out of the whole number, and of course he knew them, he knew their histories, he knew their proclivities, he knew what they would be as presented and left to themselves, left to answer for themselves before the great potentate.<a name=483:8></a> Many of our young people may be called before the tribunals, and how glad they are to find they have one like Joseph with them, standing by them, having a sympathetic look to support them in a time of pressure.<a name=483:9></a> How sweet it is when the brethren join in with their sympathy, when a young brother or sister is faced with the question, "What is your occupation?<a name=483:10></a>" He may say, I did not cause the war.<a name=483:11></a> Of course not, but are you wholly immune from any charges as to it?<a name=483:12></a> Each one has to challenge himself as to what the calamity means.<a name=483:13></a>

		The passage goes on to show that Jacob was brought in under Pharaoh, and the whole position in Egypt is clarified, and the people of God are there now; they have the advantage of the favour of Pharaoh, and God can bring like conditions about for <i>us</i>.<a name=488:11></a> It is a question of <i>God</i>, what He can do, and what we are <i>occupied with</i>, what our occupation is, whether we love the brethren, whether we are going on with the brethren, whether all our interests are there, whether we dwell amongst our own people and refuse worldly associations and the like.<a name=488:12></a> We are to dwell among our own people, and God is with <i>them</i>; and we learn that God is with them of a truth.<a name=488:13></a> God is true and the victory is ours on these lines, as I said.<a name=488:14></a> It is for the young persons especially now to take to heart these things.<a name=488:15></a> The measure of the favourableness in which we stand under the government of God in this country and the western countries generally is to be carefully observed.<a name=488:16></a> God has come in for His people, at least in measure.<a name=488:17></a> But how long the advantage will remain is with Him, and if we fail Him we may have to own like Jonah the "cause" lies with <i>us</i>.<a name=488:18></a> Thus the need of "having denied impiety and worldly lusts, we should live soberly and justly and piously in the present course of things", <a href="../bible/Titus.htm#2:12">Titus  2:12</a>.<a name=488:19></a>

		These scriptures afford us intelligence as to how the prophetic word made known before a catastrophe, that is the deluge, appears in its application afterwards.<a name=489:1></a> In these two days we have spent together we have reminded each other of how God brings His people through disasters, always leading to triumph, as Paul says in the verses read in 2 Corinthians -- "Who always leads us in triumph in the Christ, and makes manifest the odour of his knowledge through us in every place", that is to say, God being God, is "over all, and through all, and in us all", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:7">Ephesians  4:7</a>.<a name=489:2></a> He has right of way everywhere; at all times and in all places.<a name=489:3></a> His thought is to make Himself known, to make His love known, always bringing in Christ.<a name=489:4></a> So it is in this present moment in this hall, to speak simply; we are reminded of how God can make a way through the, greatest difficulties for His people, setting us down in a convenient place to reveal His thoughts to us, imparting His knowledge to us, but always through Christ.<a name=489:5></a> We are in a mediatorial system -- the Father, the Son and the Spirit.<a name=489:6></a> They are all active, love being behind every action.<a name=489:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		word was befitting.<a name=490:1></a> At the time of the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ messages were conveyed through Gabriel, a great angel, a priestly angel, suitable for the moment, for it was the birth, not of Zacharias, but of the Messiah, the High Priest of God.<a name=490:2></a> He was foreshadowed by Melchisedec, but He was <i>born</i>.<a name=490:3></a> A priestly angel announces the coming birth, and in due course other angels announce the actual birth; they are all full of instruction and encouragement for us.<a name=490:4></a> So Lamech had his part, Enoch had his part too, and Noah also, coming after; thus there was at least a prophetic ministry at that time, immediate and pointing on to the great future.<a name=490:5></a>

		In moving on to chapter 8 I desire to bring in the positive side, how Noah carried through what had been said at his birth, and it is an important matter to carry things through, however long, until the application of the prophecy concerning them can be made.<a name=491:1></a> Noah had gone through six hundred years but he carried things through, even as in the days of Samuel, nothing fell to the ground that Samuel had said.<a name=491:2></a> So this prophecy did not fall to the ground, as far as Noah was concerned; there were many who cared nothing for it, for the world had gone astray from God, but God was about to deal with it, and He did; He made an end of things as they were.<a name=491:3></a>

		Now I want to bring out the subject of the prophecy; that is, Noah, and how Noah carried it down and how he acted in the spirit of it.<a name=491:4></a> Scripture brings out the spirit of things as well as the actual things, and Noah brought in the spirit of the thing; that is to say, he offered up burnt offerings; he built an altar and offered up burnt offerings on it, of every clean creature, and Jehovah smelled a sweet savour, 'an odour of rest'.<a name=491:5></a> All the offerings are to God, as the angel said to Manoah, If you bring a burnt offering, offer it to God.<a name=491:6></a> We are to learn things by the way in our experiences, that God must come first at all times and in all places.<a name=491:7></a> Now the time has come for the fulfilment of the thought in Noah, for the sweet savour, a savour of rest,, and God smelled it.<a name=491:8></a> That is, you might say, the renewed earth is now clear, sin has been dealt with, and the earth is filled with an odour of rest.<a name=491:9></a> I am not saying that the word filled is there, but I am thinking of the house in which Mary of Bethany offered.<a name=491:10></a> The Lord said, she had performed a good work on Him.<a name=491:11></a> She anointed Him and the house was filled; not the earth nor the world, but the <i>house</i> was filled with the odour of the ointment.<a name=491:12></a> This has always been

		So, as I said, God was saying things in His heart, and these things referred to a provisional state of things on the earth, and that provisional state of things remains now and will remain to the end of the millennium -- "while the earth remaineth".<a name=495:4></a> It is not a question of heaven or of heavenly things, but of what God does and what He does provisionally, and how merciful He is in the provision that He affords to us and to men, all men being involved in God's mercy, what He makes available to us to carry on, otherwise we can scarcely have anything.<a name=495:5></a> See how God is preserving the whole race.<a name=495:6></a> I should not think the number has been greatly diminished in modern times, the births have been greatly increased, and God is thus speaking to men as to His mercy, for He is not willing that any should perish.<a name=495:7></a> It is a question of what God would do in His mercy provisionally so as to keep things going and carry out His ways in men as they are.<a name=495:8></a> In the millennial day He will show what He can do even in a positive sense with men as they are, men and women in flesh and blood.<a name=495:9></a> But we are now dealing with the world as it is, and that is what God was saying in His heart at the time of which I am speaking.<a name=495:10></a>

		Now I am speaking in a certain way to encourage our hearts and at the same time to bring in a measure of light as to this matter of provisional conditions which God is affording now to the human race, as indicated in the scripture read in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#8">Genesis  8</a>.<a name=498:13></a> It is a question of mercy, that God is merciful to all His creatures, not willing that any should perish.<a name=498:14></a> The provision of the government of God is a testimony to it.<a name=498:15></a> The general government of God is a testimony to God and bears on the gospel.<a name=498:16></a> What He has done in certain nations in recent times to ease off the opposition of the enemy is certainly a matter of thanksgiving to God.<a name=498:17></a> But it may stop; in the hardness of our hearts we may forget and cease to pray, and it may be stopped, because He is the <i>living</i> God.<a name=498:18></a> It is well to bring these things forward so that we may be real in the whole position and know how to approach God and to serve and to

		As to the provisional conditions, of which I have spoken, much could be added as to what may happen in the seed-time and in the harvest-time in the way of loss or damage to crops of which God said nothing to Noah; but He sometimes speaks in <i>facts</i> and such facts are in part the wonderful provision in the western continent, and of course the British Empire.<a name=499:3></a> <i>God</i> is doing it every day, and He is doing it for the whole race.<a name=499:4></a> He wills that all men should be saved; that is His attitude.<a name=499:5></a> So the saints are to be in accord with God in all they are and do in relation to the provisional situation and outlook.<a name=499:6></a> It may be well to say here that the provisional position which is contemplated in what I am saying is in contrast to the <i>final</i> state of things expressed in the new heaven and the new earth.<a name=499:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I go on to the passage in 2 Corinthians for a moment, so that we may see more clearly how God can go on with men provisionally.<a name=499:8></a> He is doing it for a purpose; He had something at least from the Corinthians, a great deal from Paul, therefore He was not carrying on for nothing.<a name=499:9></a> God has His rewards in what He is doing provisionally.<a name=499:10></a> The providence of God is a wonderful matter, and we are gaining from it as well as other men, but we are gaining much more.<a name=499:11></a> But I especially want to show how God has His portion, and as to whether we can shine in any giving to God, affording God some reward.<a name=499:12></a> So Paul says here, "I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother".<a name=499:13></a> He had a great regard for his brother Titus.<a name=499:14></a> It is no small matter to speak of a brother like that; those who minister characteristically value a brother, one who is sympathetic with the truth.<a name=499:15></a> "But taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia".<a name=499:16></a> Thus the question comes up as to sufficiency in

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I go on to the last passage in the book of Revelation, a book intended to enlighten us especially as to Europe in regard to the present situation.<a name=500:4></a> Wars have been current all these years, from which many have suffered, but God has His little book as we see in the book of Revelation.<a name=500:5></a> It is not a big book; it says the very opposite, it is a little book, but it contains light, and that afforded support to the prophet John.<a name=500:6></a> I am speaking about John as a prophet; it is a prophetic book.<a name=500:7></a> John is, we may say, the prophet; and what a prophet!<a name=500:8></a> The beloved disciple, the beloved apostle, now faithful as a prophet, faithfully making known what God had in His mind as to the seven assemblies, and then as to Europe.<a name=500:9></a> I am speaking simply; the little book refers to Europe; that is to say, God's ways in regard to Europe.<a name=500:10></a> In all these terrible wars Europe has been the centre, and Gods gives us understanding as to it all.<a name=500:11></a> John had to eat the little book, it was given to him that he should eat it, and at the same time the Angel, representing the Lord Jesus, puts His right foot on the sea and His left foot on the land, as if to say, I am <i>coming</i>.<a name=500:12></a> I am taking charge!<a name=500:13></a> This is the situation.<a name=500:14></a> He puts His right foot on the sea, and His left foot on the land; He is asserting in testimony that the sea and the land belong to Him, and that He uses them as He pleases.<a name=500:15></a> So He directs John what and how to eat, and he

		So the book of Revelation is a finished matter, and completes this wonderful final disclosure, the secret of God, what He has embodied in the assembly.<a name=501:11></a> That is what I want to finish with tonight.<a name=501:12></a> Although Paul had completed the word of God, the whole range of the truth, yet John had this special revelation of the Lord Jesus signified to him.<a name=501:13></a> Paul has told us everything about the assembly; as I said, he completed the word of God.<a name=501:14></a> Paul spoke to the Corinthians in the most touching way as to the assembly; he said, "I have espoused you unto one man", and I appeal to the young people who are not espoused to Him, that Christ should be <i>in the heart</i>, the hidden Man of the heart.<a name=501:15></a> Learn to keep things hidden.<a name=501:16></a> We are not to cast our pearls before swine, we are to learn to be mysterious, for the mystery of God <i>is</i> a mystery to those who are not Christ's; and we have to be mysterious in order to hold to it, and that it may work out in our ways and walk and enjoyment.<a name=501:17></a> So we have this wonderful scene, and John writes his name down to show he is a competent witness of it.<a name=501:18></a> He understands what he is saying: "I John saw the holy city,

	<div class="paragraph">
		The last word from God is through Paul, because it says he completed the word of God, and that "by revelation the mystery has been made known to me", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:3">Ephesians  3:3</a>.<a name=502:9></a> It is not that other things were not stated, but as to the general range of truth, what is in the mind of God is all disclosed through Paul.<a name=502:10></a> As has been urged by a great servant when departing to be with Christ: 'Do not forget John, but cleave to Paul'.<a name=502:11></a> He is the minister of the assembly.<a name=502:12></a> So now John <i>knows</i>, the Revelation confirming Paul.<a name=502:13></a> A great point in this book is that it is made known to the <i>bondmen</i>, not to the apostles, from heaven; but to the bondmen, those who are bond-servants of Christ.<a name=502:14></a> In form and character it is a new thing; "Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to show to his bondmen what must shortly take place".<a name=502:15></a> You can see therefore what a place John has in this book; he is the writer of it, and the Lord tells him how to divide it, how it should be

		Now the great final thought is this: "I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea".<a name=503:7></a> A great change from mere provisional conditions, rain and snow and sunshine and heat, changing all the time, but here things are fixed, they are settled.<a name=503:8></a> It is a question of what comes out of heaven from God "I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea".<a name=503:9></a> Then he says, "I John, saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband".<a name=503:10></a>

		So here we have in John's record, "For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives not the Spirit by measure".<a name=549:4></a> Now that applies to Christ and the same principle is found with the assembly.<a name=549:5></a> The Spirit is on earth as when Christ was here.<a name=549:6></a> He is here personally.<a name=549:7></a> And think of the delight of the assembly sharing the Father's thoughts of the Son.<a name=549:8></a> And so it goes on, "He that believes on the Son has life eternal, and he that is not subject to the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides upon him".<a name=549:9></a> Not 'will abide' -- but <i>abides</i>.<a name=549:10></a> God is saying, I have an Object supreme for My affections, and He is also saying there are persons not subject to that Person and My wrath abides on them.<a name=549:11></a> Paul speaks of the wrath of God revealed from heaven but does not say it is executed -- John is saying that, it is being executed.<a name=549:12></a> Persons who are not subject to the Son -- the wrath of God abides on them.<a name=549:13></a> One of the most solemn things I can say, but it is true.<a name=549:14></a> The point is, you see, to listen to the words that are coming, that are being spoken.<a name=549:15></a> God is speaking by His Spirit in His assembly, the oracles of God, and they are final.<a name=549:16></a> God is speaking, and we are listening and these words are to be effective so that we set to our seal that God is true.<a name=549:17></a> We are dealing with true things, and we ourselves are true.<a name=549:18></a> So the matter is settled either way.<a name=549:19></a> The point is that here there are subject persons who know the love of the Father for the Son, the infinitely satisfactory Object of His affections.<a name=549:20></a> And then there are those upon whom the wrath of God abides.<a name=549:21></a> There is hardly a more solemn statement than that.<a name=549:22></a> And there are such people on this earth now.<a name=549:23></a> It behoves us that none of us may be found leaning to the ways

		Well now coming to James, I just wish to confirm what John testifies to us.<a name=550:3></a> James like Hebrews deals with the state of things in which there are persons who are called brethren and are not Christians, and persons called brethren that are Christians, who are presumably considered heavenly and who are to represent heaven and they will represent heaven and James is showing how it comes about.<a name=550:4></a> In chapter 1: 17 "Every good gift and every perfect gift comes down from above, from the Father of lights, with whom is no variation nor shadow of turning".<a name=550:5></a> The first word is that the gifts are good, the second they are perfect.<a name=550:6></a> That is the Holy Spirit, the most perfect gift ever given to the saints, comes down from <i>above</i>.<a name=550:7></a> Then in chapter 3 he comes to the point of a person who has wisdom.<a name=550:8></a> "Who is wise and understanding among you; let him shew out of a good conversation his works in meekness of wisdom".<a name=550:9></a> James is considering that there are such.<a name=550:10></a> He goes on to say, "But if ye have bitter emulation and strife in your hearts, do not boast and lie against the truth.<a name=550:11></a> This is not the wisdom which comes down from above, but earthly, natural, devilish.<a name=550:12></a> For where emulation and strife are, there is disorder and every evil thing".<a name=550:13></a> Now that is Christendom of these days; it was Jewish then.<a name=550:14></a> James writes to the twelve tribes, not leaving any out.<a name=550:15></a> Then it goes on, "But the wisdom from above first is pure, then peaceful, gentle, yielding, full of mercy and good fruits, unquestioning, unfeigned.<a name=550:16></a> But the fruit of righteousness in peace is sown for them that make peace".<a name=550:17></a> That is, heaven is going to be represented.<a name=550:18></a> These are not the persons he has in mind in the next chapter.<a name=550:19></a> He speaks there about persons who fight.<a name=550:20></a> "Whence come wars and whence fightings among you?<a name=550:21></a> Is it not thence, from your pleasures,

		Well now just a final word as to David.<a name=553:13></a> How this is seen in the beautiful metaphors of David, which have such a great place in the testimony of God.<a name=553:14></a> David is speaking of Aaron here.<a name=553:15></a> He is alluding to <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#29">Exodus  29</a>which tells us how Aaron and his sons were anointed.<a name=553:16></a> David is speaking of Christ's anointing and is mentioning the things that are beautiful.<a name=553:17></a> "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!<a name=553:18></a>" He likens them to Aaron as he is shown in the Pentateuch.<a name=553:19></a> We have already alluded to the Pentateuch as from Moses and containing <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#29">Exodus  29</a>and <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#8">Leviticus  8</a>which tell of the anointing of Aaron.<a name=553:20></a> David is bringing you by the Spirit through all that.<a name=553:21></a> He is going down over the Person.<a name=553:22></a> He speaks of Hermon -- Hermon is the thought of what is above.<a name=553:23></a> He is occupied with what is above.<a name=553:24></a> In <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#29">Exodus  29</a>Aaron is anointed with his sons, but it is Aaron by himself that David is speaking of here.<a name=553:25></a> It is the personal beauty of Christ.<a name=553:26></a>

		What a lover of Christ David was!<a name=554:1></a> You can sense it in some measure as he goes over the person of Aaron.<a name=554:2></a> "Like the precious oil upon the head, that ran down upon the beard".<a name=554:3></a> Now you say, What is in that?<a name=554:4></a> Well this would enhance the beauty that belongs to Aaron.<a name=554:5></a> David had a vision of what Aaron must have been.<a name=554:6></a> He is speaking of this anointing oil upon his beard that reaches to the hem of his garment.<a name=554:7></a> David can see all that.<a name=554:8></a> Can we?<a name=554:9></a> It is written by the Spirit of God as to how Christ was anointed from above and how it came down, the Spirit coming down upon His Person even to the skirts of His garment.<a name=554:10></a> And David says this is the picture the Spirit of God has caused him to see.<a name=554:11></a> Shall we ever see Him thus?<a name=554:12></a> Shall I ever see Him?<a name=554:13></a> Yes, we shall see Him.<a name=554:14></a> A spiritual man sees Him thus without rebuking gaze.<a name=554:15></a> He can rebuke many, but He loves to look at each of us without rebuking gaze.<a name=554:16></a> He loves to be amongst the saints thus.<a name=554:17></a> It is said of one that he was the disciple whom Jesus loved.<a name=554:18></a> He never mentions his own name, but just designates himself the disciple whom Jesus loved.<a name=554:19></a> It is beautiful that he could speak of himself in that way.<a name=554:20></a> God rebukes us at times -- as many as I love I rebuke and discipline.<a name=554:21></a> But that is not in a final way.<a name=554:22></a> He can always say to the saints, I rebuke you because I love you, because I want to look at you without rebuking gaze.<a name=554:23></a> And He can and will do so.<a name=554:24></a> He will make us like Himself.<a name=554:25></a> What a time that will be!<a name=554:26></a> Divine Persons enjoying life eternal not only in one another but in the saints.<a name=554:27></a> God has been working for this all these centuries to look at His people without rebuking gaze and with perfect complacency.<a name=554:28></a> He rebukes and disciplines to this end that He may look at us the more restfully and joyously.<a name=554:29></a> Think of the Lord looking at that disciple, the one whom Jesus loved.<a name=554:30></a> How I would like the Lord to look at me in that way.<a name=554:31></a> Let us each challenge our
