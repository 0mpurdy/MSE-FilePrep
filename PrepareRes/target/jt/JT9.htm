		J.T.<a name=1:2></a> The exercise has been that we might see how God comes in to assert His sovereign rights.<a name=1:3></a> Elijah, who is introduced abruptly here, represents this thought.<a name=1:4></a> The statement he makes in the first verse seems to be the key to his whole history and ministry.<a name=1:5></a> It says: "As Jehovah the God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, except by my word".<a name=1:6></a> Whatever other authorities or powers may have existed, Ahab or anyone else, dew and rain were made to depend on the word of this man, and I thought that he in that way foreshadows the Lord Jesus.<a name=1:7></a> God has introduced a Man whose word is to determine things, and we know that all that has come out in connection with the gospel is on that basis.<a name=1:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.L.<a name=1:9></a> At the end of the previous chapter we read that Ahab did more to provoke the anger of the Lord God than any other king; and then the rebuilding of Jericho was a greater expression of defiance of the rights and authority of God than in any other act.<a name=1:10></a> It is significant that Elijah comes abruptly on the scene after the record of those two things.<a name=1:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.L.<a name=1:12></a>P.<a name=1:13></a> It is remarkable that Elijah says this seemingly of his own accord.<a name=1:14></a> This suggests that he realised that he had a very great place here.<a name=1:15></a> You were speaking of him as being a type of Christ.<a name=1:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:17></a> There had undoubtedly been serious exercise in his soul preceding this.<a name=1:18></a> He is not said to be a man of any special note.<a name=1:19></a> He was simply "of the inhabitants of Gilead".<a name=1:20></a> He had no special distinction

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.H.<a name=2:2></a>P.<a name=2:3></a> The meaning of his name "Jehovah is God" is striking in view of the idolatry that Ahab had set up.<a name=2:4></a> He was true to his name in all his ministry.<a name=2:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.B.<a name=2:6></a> The authority referred to here is vested in Christ, and we need to have our attention called to it.<a name=2:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.F.<a name=2:8></a>M.<a name=2:9></a> Would this be parallel with Mark's gospel where you have the prophetic word of Christ?<a name=2:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:11></a> I think Elijah represents Christ as embodying the prophetic ministry.<a name=2:12></a> It is said in Romans that the righteousness of God had been witnessed to by the law and the prophets.<a name=2:13></a> Now Christ came in on that line.<a name=2:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.L.<a name=2:15></a> It is remarkable that the introduction of Elijah is as a "man of God"; as you were saying, the man of exercise.<a name=2:16></a> It seems to be very significant that there is no genealogy or anything of the sort, but he comes on the scene abruptly and is recognised as a "man of God".<a name=2:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:18></a> So he says: "As Jehovah the God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand", That was his attitude, and at the end of the chapter it is said to him by the woman: "I know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of Jehovah in thy mouth is truth".<a name=2:19></a> So in that way his word is confirmed.<a name=2:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		B.T.<a name=2:21></a>F.<a name=2:22></a> Would you say Elijah referred more to the ministry of the Lord while here on earth?<a name=2:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:24></a> Yes.<a name=2:25></a> It has been remarked that the gospel of Mark would correspond with it, in that Mark presents the Lord as the Servant-Prophet.<a name=2:26></a> The book opens thus: "Beginning of the glad tidings of Jesus Christ, Son of God", <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#1:1">Mark  1:1</a>.<a name=2:27></a> We have no record of the Lord's previous life.<a name=2:28></a> It is simply that He is there and God has Him there.<a name=2:29></a> It is not the beginning of His life, but of His ministry.<a name=2:30></a> So with Elijah, save

		what we hear from James in the New Testament, we know nothing of his previous history; but it is enough to know that he stood before Jehovah, that the signs that mark his ministry brought about the confession: "The word of Jehovah in thy mouth is truth".<a name=3:1></a> It seems as if Mark's presentation of the ministry of Christ carries special conviction with it.<a name=3:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.L.<a name=3:3></a> It is also significant to see how the Lord at the outset of His ministry takes up this seventeenth chapter of Kings.<a name=3:4></a> "There were many widows in Israel in the days of Elias .<a name=3:5></a>.<a name=3:6></a>.<a name=3:7></a> to none of them was Elias sent"; and then he continued of Elisha, "there were many lepers in Israel .<a name=3:8></a>.<a name=3:9></a>.<a name=3:10></a> and none of them was cleansed but Naaman the Syrian", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4:25">Luke  4:25</a> - 27.<a name=3:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.B-w.<a name=3:12></a> He comes upon the scene because there was a moral necessity for it.<a name=3:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:14></a> The end of the previous chapter, as was remarked, emphasises the necessity, so that in this chapter it seems to me the ministry presented is one of restoration, not the introduction of something new exactly, as under Elisha, but restoration; as the Lord said of John, when he is come he will "restore all things" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#17:11">Matthew  17:11</a>) so that the child here is <i>brought back</i>.<a name=3:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		B.T.<a name=3:16></a>F.<a name=3:17></a> Elijah is a witness for God here, He came from Gilead, which means 'Hill of witness'.<a name=3:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=3:19></a>M.<a name=3:20></a> Would the conditions in which Elijah was sustained in the beginning of the chapter suggest the Lord here upon earth?<a name=3:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:22></a> I think so.<a name=3:23></a> If we compare the chapter with <a href="../bible/2Kings.htm#4">2 Kings  4</a>, what we see is that there is no over plus here, no idea of living 'on the rest'.<a name=3:24></a> It is simply that "The meal in the barrel shall not waste, neither shall the oil in the cruse fail", There should be enough, but no abundance, no idea of paying "thy debt", nor of living on the rest, nor of a 'great woman' spiritually.<a name=3:25></a> It is simply that there should be sufficient and in that way I think it denotes the state of things before the coming of the Spirit.<a name=3:26></a>

		F.L.<a name=4:1></a> "I am come that they might have life, and might have [it] abundantly", <a href="../bible/John.htm#10:10">John  10:10</a>.<a name=4:2></a> I suppose in the days of the Lord on earth it was more the expression of life; in the day of the Spirit it is more abundantly.<a name=4:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That point you brought out about recovery is uncommonly interesting; it is said that Elijah took the child to an upper chamber and there he nourished it into life.<a name=4:4></a> It suggests the Lord in the upper chamber unfolding all that which nourished the little company of the remnant into life.<a name=4:5></a> He took them up into the upper chamber, and it was there the Lord really nourished them.<a name=4:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:7></a> You will notice in Elijah's history that the idea of <i>elevation</i> gives character to it.<a name=4:8></a> Now what is said of the child here is, that "he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into the upper chamber where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed".<a name=4:9></a> That is a great point, I think.<a name=4:10></a> Naturally the mother's bosom was the place for the child, but there was no life-giving power there, no hope of recovery or restoration on that line.<a name=4:11></a> The great principle of restoration was there in Christ; but, as you said, it was the upper loft or chamber.<a name=4:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=4:13></a>M.<a name=4:14></a> What would the barrel of meal and the cruse of oil suggest?<a name=4:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:16></a> The woman says: "I have not a cake but a handful of meal .<a name=4:17></a>.<a name=4:18></a>.<a name=4:19></a> and a little oil in a cruse".<a name=4:20></a> That is her estimation.<a name=4:21></a> Then he says, "The meal in the barrel shall not waste, neither shall the oil in the cruse fail until the day that Jehovah sendeth rain upon the face of the earth!<a name=4:22></a>" He drops the diminutive words "handful" and "little".<a name=4:23></a> That is, I suppose, from the divine side it was not a handful.<a name=4:24></a> It was infinite.<a name=4:25></a> As John says, "I suppose that not even the world itself would contain the books written" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#21:25">John  21:25</a>); but it would <i>continue</i> at any rate, that is the point.<a name=4:26></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=5:3></a>M.<a name=5:4></a> Here it is what she had.<a name=5:5></a> In the first part of the chapter Elijah is standing independent of anybody.<a name=5:6></a> That is, the ravens brought him food and he drank of the brook, but I was wondering in this part whether what she had was acquired of Lord.<a name=5:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:8></a> Of course it is on the line of sovereignty all the way through here; as was remarked, "to none of them was Elias sent, but to Sarepta of Sidonia", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4:26">Luke  4:26</a>.<a name=5:9></a> It was God acting sovereignly, but at the same time there was a certain measure of faith there, although it was feeble and wanting in intelligence.<a name=5:10></a> She was going to eat to die, which is really, you might say, a contradiction of terms.<a name=5:11></a> You do not eat to die: you eat to live.<a name=5:12></a> But at the same time, there was a measure of light, seen in the fact that she had the meal and the oil.<a name=5:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		P.H.<a name=5:14></a>P.<a name=5:15></a> That was a reflection on Israel, because not even as much was found in them.<a name=5:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:17></a> That is the point.<a name=5:18></a> In <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4">Luke  4</a>they would have the Lord on the line of nature.<a name=5:19></a> "Whatsoever we have heard has taken place in Capernaum do here also in <i>thine own country</i>", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4:23">Luke  4:23</a>.<a name=5:20></a> They would be accredited on that line, so He immediately brings in these passages because it was a question of the <i>truth</i> and the sovereign rights of God.<a name=5:21></a>

		J.T.<a name=6:7></a> In <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4">Luke  4</a>, the Lord says, "Today this scripture is fulfilled in your ears" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4:21">Luke  4:21</a>) and that scripture was, as we know, <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#61:1">Isaiah  61:1</a> - 2.<a name=6:8></a> It speaks not of judgment, but of God intervening in grace.<a name=6:9></a> Romans enlarges on this great theme.<a name=6:10></a> The apostle says, "I am not ashamed of the glad tidings; for it is God's power to salvation, to every one that believes .<a name=6:11></a>.<a name=6:12></a>.<a name=6:13></a> for righteousness of God is revealed therein, on the principle of faith to faith", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#1:16">Romans  1:16</a> - 17.<a name=6:14></a> Now that may be connected with the word "ears" in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4">Luke  4</a>.<a name=6:15></a> The scripture was fulfilled in their ears, but if there was not faith it would have gone no further, and we know they had no faith because they "led him up to the brow of the mountain upon which their city was built, so that they might throw him down the precipice", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4:29">Luke  4:29</a>.<a name=6:16></a> The faith was not there.<a name=6:17></a> The righteousness of God was there and presented to them; Romans teaches that the righteousness of God is presented to faith; otherwise it is wholly ineffective; so it is on the principle of "faith to faith".<a name=6:18></a>

		J.T.<a name=14:1></a> There are two thoughts especially in view in this chapter.<a name=14:2></a> One is God taking up His rights in raising up Elijah, as we had it this morning; raising him up amongst His people as one whose word should determine certain things; and then in this chapter setting him in heaven: "The Lord would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind".<a name=14:3></a> These were the two thoughts that were especially in my mind, and I suggested this chapter on that account; not that I wish to overlook that which comes in between, but only to seek to bring out the great principles which mark the introduction of Christianity.<a name=14:4></a> God would have a Man by whom everything should be regulated, and then He would have that Man where He would; namely, in heaven.<a name=14:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.L.<a name=14:6></a> So that this chapter involves more than resurrection: there is the thought of exaltation in it.<a name=14:7></a> Resurrection does not go beyond being brought out from amongst the dead: this is another thought.<a name=14:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=14:9></a> It would suggest a good deal as to translation, as to the setting in which it is found in the Word, and I think that one feature is prominent here; namely, that God would take Elijah up into the heavens and <i>how</i> He would do it, by a whirlwind.<a name=14:10></a> We know that the thought of translation appeared earlier, in Enoch.<a name=14:11></a> In Enoch it is not exactly that He would take him into the heavens, but that <i>He would take him</i>.<a name=14:12></a> "He was not, for God took him", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#5:24">Genesis  5:24</a>.<a name=14:13></a> That was not a question of God's sovereign rights exactly, His creatorial rights to the heavens and earth, but that He would have such an one as that.<a name=14:14></a> He would have him, for he pleased Him.<a name=14:15></a>

		J.T.<a name=44:3></a> It is a great subject surely.<a name=44:4></a> I was thinking of the word in John, "In him was life, and the life was the light of men", <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:4">John  1:4</a>.<a name=44:5></a> Now, I think, in that statement we have suggested what was presented objectively for all eyes to see while the Lord was here; that is, it is a Man that is in view, and the life was there in Him as light.<a name=44:6></a> It was the privilege of those that were with the Lord to see how He lived.<a name=44:7></a> He did not live by bread alone, by what He ate and drank.<a name=44:8></a> That was merely incidental to His flesh and blood condition.<a name=44:9></a> His life was not in that.<a name=44:10></a> His life was with God, and, as a Man here, He was entirely free from the pressure of death, wholly immune from it; in His mind and affections He was taken up with God and God's counsels; there was also the love He had for the disciples.<a name=44:11></a> I think it is in that way you get an apprehension of it.<a name=44:12></a>

		F.L.<a name=44:13></a> I quite go with that.<a name=44:14></a> I was thinking, that, if it is the life of a butterfly, the life of a fish, or the life of a saint, it involves environment and the scope opened to intelligence.<a name=44:15></a> So if you take the highest example in the blessed Lord, there were forty days in which He fasted (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4:2">Luke  4:2</a>), but yet in those forty days He lived.<a name=44:16></a> He lived to God.<a name=44:17></a> We are introduced into the life of Christ and it is a question of appreciation and enjoyment and feeding our souls on the things discovered in Christ.<a name=44:18></a> That makes life.<a name=44:19></a>

		J.T.<a name=61:2></a> There is progress as we come to the Shunammite, but there is a good deal in the verses that follow the first verse as to how the believer comes into the benefit of the Spirit.<a name=61:3></a> Elisha here represents the light, the mind of God, and he says to her: "Go, borrow for thyself vessels abroad from all thy neighbours, empty vessels; let it not be few; and go in, and shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and pour out into all those vessels, and set aside what is full".<a name=61:4></a> Now that is the light.<a name=61:5></a> That is what the prophet says, and it is well to observe it because it is the way to arrive at the benefit.<a name=61:6></a> We have to be regulated by the light.<a name=61:7></a> Then it says: "She went from him", (now we have the believer's side) "and shut the door upon her and upon her sons: they brought the vessels to her, and she poured out.<a name=61:8></a> And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said to her son, Bring me yet a vessel".<a name=61:9></a> That is, she was not content with what she had.<a name=61:10></a> She was prepared for more, but he says, "there is not a vessel more"; and then it says, "the oil stayed".<a name=61:11></a> That is the position here.<a name=61:12></a> What the widow was told to do is what every believer should do, shut the door in view of this precious element, and be alone, as it were, with God about it.<a name=61:13></a> I think that is how you get the enlargement.<a name=61:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In reading this passage from the Psalms what I had in mind was to call attention particularly to the twenty-fourth verse: "This is the day that Jehovah hath made".<a name=88:1></a> I wish to call attention to that day, a day of divine design and making; and in speaking about the day that the Lord hath made one is reminded of the first piece of workmanship in the creation as we know it.<a name=88:2></a> It was a day: "There was evening, and there was morning -- the first day", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:5">Genesis  1:5</a>.<a name=88:3></a> God in that way began His work with one day.<a name=88:4></a> I am not ignoring what He had done before, for much preceded that day, both in regard to time and in regard to work.<a name=88:5></a> God speaks to Job of a day, antecedent to this, a period in which God had laid the foundations of the earth.<a name=88:6></a> He wrought by weight and measure, having in mind the <i>top stone</i>, as it were, so that all should be perfectly poised.<a name=88:7></a> He wrought with design, and it is said that "the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy", <a href="../bible/Job.htm#38:7">Job  38:7</a>.<a name=88:8></a> They took account of what He was doing and they sympathised with Him in it.<a name=88:9></a> They were "glad in it".<a name=88:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>the measure of time that we find, covered by the word "day", involves, as I said, a piece of workmanship.<a name=88:11></a> God had commanded that there should be light.<a name=88:12></a> He commanded that.<a name=88:13></a> It was imperative; anything that God commands is imperative.<a name=88:14></a> It was imperative on account of the darkness; it says, "there was light", and, the light appearing at His word, He names it.<a name=88:15></a> "God called the light Day" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:5">Genesis  1:5</a>) and it "was good".<a name=88:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I mention all this so that you may at the outset have before you what I have in mind, namely, that a day is a measure of time, and that it is equivalent to light.<a name=88:17></a> "He called the light Day" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:5">Genesis  1:5</a>) then, as

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now God makes each day for us, as I was saying.<a name=89:5></a> I never look at my days as simply the product of the revolution of the sun; that is mechanical.<a name=89:6></a> They were all seen in the distance by God, and I never curse any of them.<a name=89:7></a> A Christian never curses any of his days.<a name=89:8></a> Do you ever regret the days?<a name=89:9></a> Jacob's were six score years and ten multiplied by three hundred and sixty-five.<a name=89:10></a> They were evil days, according to his own judgment of them.<a name=89:11></a> "The days of the years of my sojourning", he says, "are a hundred and thirty years.<a name=89:12></a> Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#47:9">Genesis  47:9</a>.<a name=89:13></a> Now that should not be a Christian's experience.<a name=89:14></a> Job cursed his day, the day on which he was born.<a name=89:15></a> Think of that!<a name=89:16></a> A day on which the sun arose, a day in which, as we might say, the moon and the stars with all their benign influence appeared.<a name=89:17></a> A puny man lifts up his voice to curse a day on which he was born!<a name=89:18></a> Were there no others born on that day?<a name=89:19></a> Such is man left to himself.<a name=89:20></a> He cursed his day in eloquent language, too.<a name=89:21></a>

		I am making these remarks in a very practical way to raise concern with us as to how we look at our days, and <i>how we spend them</i>.<a name=89:22></a> It is happy for us if we can take a retrospective view, and see that there has been something for God in each day that is past; and thus as day is added to day, and week to week, and month to month, and year to year, there is woven out in my history that which God can take up, and this is in view of the great moral system of things that He has in His mind for the

		F.L.<a name=106:2></a> To understand the point of view in this book I suppose we should refer back to <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#40:25">Exodus  40:25</a>.<a name=106:3></a> In that chapter things are seen in suitability to God; hence He came to dwell in the tabernacle.<a name=106:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=106:5></a> I think it is well to keep that in view, because the book of Leviticus depends on the teaching of Exodus.<a name=106:6></a> Exodus shows how the tabernacle was introduced and reared up; how that in every part it was according to the divine pattern, and anointed with oil; so God was complacent in it and came in to dwell there.<a name=106:7></a> "The glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#40:35">Exodus  40:35</a>.<a name=106:8></a> It is from this position that God speaks to Moses.<a name=106:9></a> It will be observed here that God called unto Moses, "and spoke to him out of the tent of meeting".<a name=106:10></a> He is now in a position to be approached.<a name=106:11></a>

		A.A.<a name=106:14></a>T.<a name=106:15></a> Would you say that Exodus is God's approach to man, and Leviticus man's approach to God?<a name=106:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=106:17></a> Yes.<a name=106:18></a> God came down to dwell.<a name=106:19></a> He delivered His people out of Egypt, brought them into the wilderness, and desired them to build a tabernacle that He might dwell among them.<a name=106:20></a> Therefore Exodus typifies the Lord Jesus as become Man and effecting redemption, and on the ground of this the Christian system has been established, and the way is now opened for man to approach God through Christ.<a name=106:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		J.T.<a name=181:1></a> The description of leprosy and the working of it, is lengthy.<a name=181:2></a> We can well understand the necessity for this, for it is a type of sin.<a name=181:3></a> It might be worth while to point out the divisions of this chapter.<a name=181:4></a> Verses 1 and 2 read "When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising or a scab, or bright spot", verse 9, "When a sore as of leprosy is in a man", verse 18, "when in the skin thereof cometh a boil", verse 24, "a burning inflammation", verse 29, "a sore on the head or on the beard", verse 38, "white bright spots", These are typical of the different appearances of the working of sin in a person.<a name=181:5></a> Then in verse 47 we have sin in one's circumstances; that is, garments.<a name=181:6></a>

		J.T.<a name=248:3></a> I would like to show how the spirit of the previous dispensation takes precedence of the one under Solomon.<a name=248:4></a> Whilst David remained alive judgment was not executed; he had a judgment of things but it was not executed.<a name=248:5></a> It was held in abeyance.<a name=248:6></a> I wish particularly that we might dwell on the spirit of this dispensation, and how current events are to be taken account of; that God is not now dealing in a retributive way.<a name=248:7></a> Things are held over.<a name=248:8></a> It is still the day of His grace and patience, and David has to be regarded in a different light in the beginning of chapter 2, from the light in which he is seen in chapter 1.<a name=248:9></a> Here it is simply that the days of David drew nigh that he should die, and he charged Solomon his son.<a name=248:10></a> He is now in the sense of his position and in the vigour suited to it.<a name=248:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=248:14></a> It <i>was</i> against him, but the judgment was deferred; it was not executed, which I think we should take account of.<a name=248:15></a> The present is not the time of vengeance.<a name=248:16></a> We are not the executors of vengeance.<a name=248:17></a>

		What I have before me is to say a word about the principle of inspection and appraisement in the things of God.<a name=334:1></a> The scriptures I have read will suffice to show that it exists, and, inasmuch as it exists, it necessarily becomes a question of responsibility on our side, and we are reminded that the whole of our life comes under the eye of the Lord.<a name=334:2></a>

		Now the principle of inspection goes far back.<a name=334:3></a> We are told in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:2">Hebrews  1:2</a>, that the worlds were made by the Son; "by whom also he made the worlds".<a name=334:4></a> He wrought by weight and measure in that service, there was wonderful accuracy, so that we have perfect poise in the different bodies.<a name=334:5></a> "Where wast thou", says Jehovah to Job, "when I founded the earth?<a name=334:6></a>", <a href="../bible/Job.htm#38:4">Job  38:4</a>.<a name=334:7></a> It is well to have our attention called to the wonderful handiwork of Christ seen in these stupendous bodies that are visible to us, and others that are not visible.<a name=334:8></a> And more than that, to see that what He made He upholds; as it is said, "upholding all things by the word of his power", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:3">Hebrews  1:3</a>.<a name=334:9></a>

		Then we are brought down, in the Scriptures, to the things with which we are more conversant, the earth and its immediate environment.<a name=334:10></a> In these, His handiwork is nearer to us.<a name=334:11></a> Whilst there is no time given for the creation of the worlds, yet the creation of what we are more immediately interested in, is divided into time, six days: and the principle of inspection is introduced, as if God in making things, in creating and making, would have no flaws.<a name=334:12></a> "God saw everything that he had made, and behold it was very good", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:31">Genesis  1:31</a>.<a name=334:13></a> God looks upon His own work and He says that it is good.<a name=334:14></a> He passes upon it.<a name=334:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Does it not fill your hearts that the Spirit of God can employ such language of the Lord Jesus?<a name=449:18></a> "<i>He set himself down</i>" as it reads, "on the right hand of the Majesty on high".<a name=449:19></a> "The Majesty!<a name=449:20></a>" That word "Majesty" conveys to us all that God is in dignity and glory; and this lowly Man, whom you have come

		to love, has "sat down on the right hand of the Majesty".<a name=450:1></a> There is really no other majesty.<a name=450:2></a> Jesus has seated Himself down by the right hand of that; Jesus, as I have said, whom we have come to love and revere!<a name=450:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the writer says here in chapter 8, "We have such a one High Priest who has sat down on [the] right hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens".<a name=450:4></a> He is more explicit in this chapter; it is "in heaven" instead of "on high", for he is coming to deal now with the new system, with the official system I might say, in which Christ administers What is it?<a name=450:5></a> Where is the centre of it?<a name=450:6></a> it is in heaven.<a name=450:7></a> That is where it is.<a name=450:8></a> Where is your centre?<a name=450:9></a> Where is your centre religiously?<a name=450:10></a> I do not ask you where it is politically, because this is not a political scene we are dealing with.<a name=450:11></a> It is a religious centre of which I am speaking.<a name=450:12></a> On earth men have their religious centres and their political centres; I am speaking of the religious.<a name=450:13></a> The Christian's centre is heaven, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God.<a name=450:14></a> The house of God on earth corresponds with this.<a name=450:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And then the apostle goes on to say, "Minister of the holy places and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord has pitched, [and] not man".<a name=450:16></a> It is not pitched by man.<a name=450:17></a> Are you connected with a religious organisation which is set up of men?<a name=450:18></a> Where is its centre?<a name=450:19></a> Whence is it administered?<a name=450:20></a> Test your religious connections with this passage.<a name=450:21></a> See if they measure with it.<a name=450:22></a> He says "We have such a one".<a name=450:23></a> <i>We</i> have.<a name=450:24></a> Who are the "we"?<a name=450:25></a> If there is one thing about the epistle to the Hebrews more than another, it is the <i>mutuality</i> suggested in the terms employed by the writer.<a name=450:26></a> The writer is simply a Christian.<a name=450:27></a> He does not write to them as an apostle.<a name=450:28></a> He is a Christian.<a name=450:29></a> Hence he says, "<i>We</i> have such a one".<a name=450:30></a> Can you place yourself in that company?<a name=450:31></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=451>[Page 451]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As I said, the words he employs denote mutuality.<a name=451:1></a> You will find constantly throughout the epistle "we" and "us"; that is, the writer is one of a company, and if something is to be done he joins in it; if something is to be enjoyed, he is to have part in it.<a name=451:2></a> Hebrews is characterised in this way.<a name=451:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, it says, "We have such a one High Priest, .<a name=451:4></a>.<a name=451:5></a>.<a name=451:6></a> minister of the holy places and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord has pitched, [and] not man".<a name=451:7></a> It is not pitched by man.<a name=451:8></a> It is a great deliverance for his soul when the believer sees that what is merely of man has to pass away.<a name=451:9></a> However ancient, however fortified by learning, repute and prestige it is to pass away.<a name=451:10></a> All religious systems set up by men, then, are contrary to God's mind and so pass away.<a name=451:11></a> It is serious to be connected with any of them.<a name=451:12></a> As believers, our only connection spiritually should be the tabernacle which the Lord pitched.<a name=451:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, Jesus, with all His glorious dignity in heaven, is the Minister of that; so that the dispensation of God in that way works out, as one might say, <i>housewise</i>.<a name=451:14></a> Indeed one is bold to suggest that the term "dispensation of God" involves the house.<a name=451:15></a> The teaching of 1 Timothy is quite plain as showing that what God has to dispense now is in connection with His house.<a name=451:16></a> The apostle says to Timothy that he had begged him to remain in Ephesus to look after the doctrine, to maintain the order and holiness of the house of God.<a name=451:17></a> The dispensation of God would be furthered in this way.<a name=451:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I was saying that the dispensation begins with the Lord Jesus Christ in a sitting posture.<a name=451:19></a> You may wonder why I call attention to this.<a name=451:20></a> I mention as one reason this, that it denotes restfulness and deliberation.<a name=451:21></a> We have arrived at a juncture which is very far from those two thoughts.<a name=451:22></a> The poor world is in terrible turmoil, there is very little restfulness seen even among the people of God; very little assurance

		as to things, and I might add to that, very little deliberation or meditation in regard of divine things.<a name=452:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So I venture to turn to Mark.<a name=452:2></a> Although he speaks of the Lord's activities in His service when here, yet he gives us these very remarkable instances in which He is found sitting.<a name=452:3></a> I take them in the reverse order to that in which they are found in the gospel.<a name=452:4></a> The first is: "The Lord therefore, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sat at the right hand of God".<a name=452:5></a> He sat there.<a name=452:6></a> I want you to ponder that, and I want you to ponder it in connection with what I have said; that the administration of the things of God is in the hands of Jesus; and it is carried on in perfect restfulness and in perfect deliberation.<a name=452:7></a> The administration of the gospel, for that is before us here, is therefore carried on in perfect order and effectiveness.<a name=452:8></a> It says in Hebrews that He sat down, and in Mark it says, He sat down.<a name=452:9></a> I want you to ponder the position of Christ; the posture of Christ; how the affairs of the assembly are administered; how watched over and administered in perfect restfulness and in perfect deliberation.<a name=452:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In saying that I wish to draw you into line with Him, I want to deliver you, if I can, from the restlessness of spirit, and the anxiety that mark the people of God.<a name=452:11></a> Satan would overwhelm us with anxiety, but all the storms that have arisen, all the satanic movements, have not touched the Lord in the least degree.<a name=452:12></a> He is perfectly at rest beyond it all, sitting at the right hand of the Majesty; and there in repose, having completed the work which He undertook from the Father, He is carrying on with perfect wisdom, with perfect design, the administration of the things of God, through the house, at the present time.<a name=452:13></a> It is a wonderful contemplation.<a name=452:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It says the disciples <i>went everywhere</i>.<a name=452:15></a> I want to call attention to that, because you may assume that <i>we</i>, as here seen in this world, are to sit down.<a name=452:16></a> Far

	<div class="paragraph">
		In proceeding I want to show you how the sitting posture is taken up by the Lord with regard to the <i>religion of the world</i>.<a name=453:7></a> It is a very solemn thing to me that the Lord sits down over against the temple, <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#13:3">Mark  13:3</a>.<a name=453:8></a> The temple at that time <i>had been left by Him</i>.<a name=453:9></a> As you will notice, it says, "he went out of the temple".<a name=453:10></a> The temple stood for accredited religion in the world.<a name=453:11></a> It was an imposing structure.<a name=453:12></a> There is much in Christendom today that answers to it.<a name=453:13></a> It stood up proudly on mount Zion, visible, I suppose, from a great distance.<a name=453:14></a> The Lord went across the ravine from it and sat over against it.<a name=453:15></a> The Lord has taken up a position of vantage, whence He surveys the religion which is accredited in this world.<a name=453:16></a> "He sat" it says, "opposite the temple" If found in a religion accredited in this world a believer's position is most serious.<a name=453:17></a> The Lord is not there; on the contrary He is sitting over against it.<a name=453:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Only recently I was speaking about "high places".<a name=453:19></a> The prophet Habakkuk says he would walk upon his high places, <a href="../bible/Habakkuk.htm#3:19">Habakkuk  3:19</a>.<a name=453:20></a> He speaks of what is the privilege of Christians, to walk upon their high places.<a name=453:21></a> But I want to say to you that <i>our</i> high places are not the high places spoken of in the books of Kings and Chronicles.<a name=453:22></a> There we read of high places in which incense was offered and sacrifices which the Lord had not commanded.<a name=453:23></a> What about these high places?<a name=453:24></a> These imposing structures, (let me speak plainly), which men regard as theirs, are not built by divine direction.<a name=453:25></a> They are not reared up by divine

	<div class="paragraph">
		I am not saying the house of God is in heaven, for it is not; but I do say with Jacob, that it is "the gate of heaven".<a name=454:16></a> With him this was a conclusion arrived at.<a name=454:17></a> I do not know whether you have reached the blessedness of heavenly influence and associations, but I do know that if you reach the house of God you will reach this.<a name=454:18></a> It is a "high place" such as Habakkuk speaks of.<a name=454:19></a> He says "he will make me to walk upon <i>my</i> high places".<a name=454:20></a> But I mention this in passing, so that you may have before you that, in the abandonment of the high places of man, God affords you a high place, a place that is far higher than theirs; for it is "the gate of heaven", as Jacob calls it.<a name=454:21></a> I might add to that, that the gate is the

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, I come to the third passage in Mark.<a name=455:3></a> It says: "Jesus sat over against the treasury".<a name=455:4></a> <i>He sat</i>.<a name=455:5></a> I take it, that the sitting posture in each instance is to denote restfulness and deliberation.<a name=455:6></a> Think of the scrutinising eye of Christ as He sits down over against your pocketbook!<a name=455:7></a> I want to be very simple.<a name=455:8></a> I mean to say, He takes account of the Christian's belongings in regard to God, as the treasury of God.<a name=455:9></a> God has a treasury, but I speak for a moment of what is material.<a name=455:10></a> It says, "Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury".<a name=455:11></a> It is searching with regard to our belongings.<a name=455:12></a> It is a dispensing time.<a name=455:13></a> It is a poor Christian that has not something to dispense.<a name=455:14></a> It is much greater to have the spiritual than the material; but, suppose I have the material; how about that?<a name=455:15></a> There is the treasury of God.<a name=455:16></a> The Lord Jesus sits over against it, and He sits over against it, not to watch what is in it, not as the custodian of it.<a name=455:17></a> No.<a name=455:18></a> He sits over against it to see how each one casts into it.<a name=455:19></a> That is what He is there for.<a name=455:20></a> These are serious considerations.<a name=455:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The writer to the Hebrews says: "of doing good and communicating [of your substance] be not forgetful".<a name=455:22></a> We are apt to forget it.<a name=455:23></a> We are apt to forget that while the spiritual is ministered, the material is also necessary.<a name=455:24></a> "be not forgetful", he says; and then he says further, "with such sacrifices <i>God</i> is well pleased".<a name=455:25></a> Think of being able to render pleasure to God by what you have in your pocketbook!<a name=455:26></a> Such is the dispensation in which we are.<a name=455:27></a> The Lord sits over against the treasury.<a name=455:28></a> As I said, He is not there to watch what is in the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		While, as I said, He was not taking account of what was in the treasury, yet He can make use of it.<a name=456:9></a> As of old, the Levites who carried the more cumbrous things of the tabernacle, required wagons, so today the administration of the house, the dispensation of God, requires that we should not forget to communicate of our substance.<a name=456:10></a> I am not of course making as much of it as of spiritual sacrifices.<a name=456:11></a> I would say a word about them.<a name=456:12></a> Peter speaks of our privilege "to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ", <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:5">1 Peter  2:5</a>.<a name=456:13></a> That is another thing.<a name=456:14></a> It is a much greater thing to be able to offer a spiritual sacrifice than a sacrifice of my material substance.<a name=456:15></a> A spiritual sacrifice is "by Jesus Christ".<a name=456:16></a> I require the High Priest for that, but I do not require the High Priest exactly to communicate of my substance.<a name=456:17></a> It does not say that I am to do that "by Jesus Christ", but it does say that I am not to forget it, for if I do it I minister pleasure to God.<a name=456:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, now I am coming to another point, and that is, that the administration of the house requires <i>priests</i>.<a name=456:19></a> And so in Hebrews the Lord is said to be "such a one High Priest".<a name=456:20></a> In the old economy, as you will be aware, there were no <i>seats</i> in the tabernacle.<a name=456:21></a> The high priest even had no chair there.<a name=456:22></a> Indeed Hebrews says "every priest <i>standeth</i>" They carried on their labours in a standing posture.<a name=456:23></a> That meant there was nothing finished, that things were always in a waiting, unfinished, incomplete condition,

		In referring to Haggai and to Zechariah, one is encouraged in that way as seeing the bearing of these scriptures directly towards ourselves; supporting, I need not add, and confirming that which we find in the New Testament.<a name=460:7></a> The epistles directly addressed to Christians are amplified I believe in these Old Testament prophets.<a name=460:8></a> In turning to Haggai, a prophet evidently used of God to stir up the consciences of the people, in order that they might resume the work they had allowed to lapse, one is greatly interested in this remark, "The word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, and my Spirit, remain among you" The <i>word remained</i>, and also the <i>Spirit remained</i>.<a name=460:9></a> It is quite simple to make application of this to ourselves now, and I dwell upon it in order to make room for what I have to say in regard of construction.<a name=460:10></a>

		Many of us will be aware that there were two covenants made with Israel after they came out of the land of Egypt.<a name=461:4></a> The first was made at Sinai, or Horeb, and I may remark here that there is a distinction to be made in regard of the two mounts.<a name=461:5></a> The second covenant was made in the plains of Moab, forty years later, as you will find in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#29:1">Deuteronomy  29:1</a>.<a name=461:6></a> I do not know which is referred to here, but I suppose the reference is <i>general</i>; it is not the <i>demand</i> of the law that is in view here, although I am not ignoring the fact that everything must be fulfilled, but, beloved friends, it is what lay behind the thought of the covenant, namely, God's love.<a name=461:7></a> Compare <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#33:3">Deuteronomy  33:3</a>.<a name=461:8></a> This is included in what I do not doubt is alluded to here, that is, that what God was to them when He took them out of Egypt centuries before remained, and the power amongst them which corresponded with the Spirit remained also.<a name=461:9></a> Now, as I have said, the application of that to us is very obvious and I wish to bring it before you so that we may be assured as to the conditions under which we find ourselves, that there is no change as to the blessed Holy Spirit, who remains in each of us as believers, and in the assembly collectively.<a name=461:10></a>

		I have no doubt that the first covenant made with Israel had reference, typically, to the lordship of Christ -- His authority; it was a question mainly of meeting the conditions which arose on account of the state of the people; and for us the lordship of Christ involves our wills being subdued and the love of God being brought into our hearts.<a name=461:11></a> Christ has witnessed to the love of God in His death on the cross, and in going into heaven He received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, and shed

		The second covenant spoken of in Deuteronomy, I believe, involves headship.<a name=462:4></a> Let us, dear brethren, take account of headship.<a name=462:5></a> The lordship of Christ involves, as I have said, that my will is broken, that my heart is filled with the love of God and that I am protected from all enemies; in a word that I am saved.<a name=462:6></a> One can lift up one's head, as it were, in the presence of enemies in the sense of the power that is in the hand of Christ.<a name=462:7></a> But further, this world is a labyrinth of evil, more so now than ever, and how are we to wend our way through it?<a name=462:8></a> How are we to find our place in relation to what God has set up in Christ?<a name=462:9></a> That is another side of the truth, and we need that side.<a name=462:10></a> If we are to move intelligently according to God, in relation to Him and to Christ, and to one another, we need to apprehend headship.<a name=462:11></a>

		Now, I would point out that in Deuteronomy it is not, speaking generally, what Moses was <i>commanded</i> to say, though that is spoken of, but it is in the main what <i>Moses himself said</i> to the people, for he had affection for them.<a name=462:12></a> God loved the people and Moses loved them too.<a name=462:13></a> The covenant spoken of was consummated on the plains of Moab forty years or so after the first one, and after being written in a book it was placed in the ark of the covenant alongside the "tables" See <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#31:24">Deuteronomy  31:24</a> - 26.<a name=462:14></a> We need, at this present time, to take account of what Christ can be to us in the way of counsel and guidance.<a name=462:15></a> It is a remarkable thing that in His address to Laodicea in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3">Revelation  3</a>, He offers counsel.<a name=462:16></a> He says, "I counsel thee to buy of me gold purified by fire" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:18">Revelation  3:18</a>) and so the Lord is prepared to accord counsel to

		The book of Deuteronomy in that way instructs the people, not how to walk in the wilderness, but how they should comport themselves in the land of Canaan, a most important part of their education; and we have to be taught how we are to comport ourselves in regard of the new place into which we are brought, which involves our relationship with the Father and the Son and with the brethren.<a name=463:3></a> All this is bound up in the great principle of headship.<a name=463:4></a> It is quite obvious that the people did not pass over into Canaan from Sinai, although it is said there were only eleven days' journey from there to Kadesh-Barnea, but they went by the way of mount Seir, which I have no doubt has reference typically to the brethren.<a name=463:5></a> The actual way, on account of the crookedness of the people, as we all know, was much longer and took a period of well-nigh forty years; but now all that is over, and the second covenant is made with the people, not as having to go through the wilderness but as having gone through it, and as having come to the confines of Canaan and about to pass over into it.<a name=463:6></a> I commend that covenant to you, for it is wonderful in the <i>spirit</i> of it.<a name=463:7></a> It is in this book that you have that remarkable expression, "All his saints are in thy hand, And they sit down at thy feet; Each receiveth of thy words", and also "Moses commanded us a law, The inheritance of the congregation of Jacob", <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#33:3">Deuteronomy  33:3</a>.<a name=463:8></a> No other people in all the world had direct communications from God save themselves.<a name=463:9></a>

		Well now, all that remained with them, and the Holy Spirit as well, so that, as I said, potentially they had everything, and so have we; and when I say potentially, I mean the thing has to be developed in us; the Holy Spirit would lay it upon us to work out what we have.<a name=463:10></a> We have everything in that

		Having thus laid the basis of what I have to say, I go on to the passage in Zechariah.<a name=464:3></a> The ministries of Haggai and Zechariah were contemporary.<a name=464:4></a> The former aroused the conscience, thus setting the people in movement; the latter brought in the purpose of God in Christ, and hence the great principle of construction which appears throughout the book.<a name=464:5></a> I would call attention to the second chapter of this prophet in connection with the latter thought, and also to the word <i>carpenters</i>.<a name=464:6></a> You will observe that this is how God meets the horns of the Gentiles; the great Gentile powers that scattered Judah are met, not by warriors, but by <i>carpenters</i>.<a name=464:7></a> Nothing in a way could be more interesting to us than building.<a name=464:8></a> God Himself is, in a sense, the great Architect of every superstructure.<a name=464:9></a> It is said in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#3:4">Hebrews  3:4</a>, "But he who has built all things [is] God", and again, "Of which [referring to the city which has foundations] God is [the] artificer and constructor", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:10">Hebrews  11:10</a>.<a name=464:10></a> I think we are entitled to distinguish in regard of what He builds, and one is quite justified in saying that the first building of God was Eve.<a name=464:11></a> I mean it is in relation to her that we have the first direct statement in Scripture of His actually building.<a name=464:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I quite recognise, as I remarked, that God builds all things, and that in laying the foundation of the earth He necessarily had in view the thought of a building, but it is remarkable that in connection with the creation of the worlds it is the word <i>framed</i> that is used.<a name=464:13></a> "By faith we apprehend that the worlds were <i>framed</i> by [the] word of God" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:3">Hebrews  11:3</a>) and "<i>he</i> spoke and it was [done], <i>he</i> commanded, and it stood fast", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#33:9">Psalm  33:9</a>.<a name=464:14></a> Things were done in that way, but when you come to the woman, how different!<a name=464:15></a> It is the rib of Adam in the hands of God.<a name=464:16></a> What will He make

		One delights in the number, as the Lord said to Paul, "I have <i>much</i> people in this city" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#18:10">Acts  18:10</a>) but then, amid that much people, the apostle begins to clear the ground for the building.<a name=466:13></a> Building is for God, and so Paul says, "I did not judge [it well] to know anything among you save Jesus Christ, and <i>him</i> crucified", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:2">1 Corinthians  2:2</a>.<a name=466:14></a> Away with all else, whatever it is, whether wealth, learning, or birth, as affording prominence in the things of God; the ground has to be cleared and the true foundation laid if things are to stand; so he says, "other foundation can no man lay besides that which [is] laid, which is Jesus Christ", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3:11">1 Corinthians  3:11</a>.<a name=466:15></a> The foundation he had laid was Jesus Christ, and no one can lay another.<a name=466:16></a> He had laid it in view of the great divine structure, and it stands.<a name=466:17></a> Now he says, "let each see how he builds upon it", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3:10">1 Corinthians  3:10</a>.<a name=466:18></a> I take that word to myself, I am to take heed <i>how</i> I build, and <i>what</i> I build.<a name=466:19></a> I have to know <i>how</i>, and I have to know <i>what</i>; that is, what material.<a name=466:20></a> So it is to be noted in Zechariah, that instead of armed warriors being used to meet these four horns of the

		I apprehend that Paul's ministry and Paul's building sent terror into the leaders of the world; what could they do against these?<a name=467:4></a> If you follow the course of the testimony in Acts, it is astonishing to see how in principle everything came down before it; as another has said, Judaism fell before it, heathenism was overthrown, and philosophy had to give way.<a name=467:5></a> I do not say that Caesar gave up his throne, but in principle Paul brought down every high thing, and in place of that he set up what was for God, namely, an invulnerable structure which stands, and will stand, when all else will have passed away, and all human workmanship shall have passed away when this noble structure will appear, as the holy city, <i>having</i> the glory of God.<a name=467:6></a>
