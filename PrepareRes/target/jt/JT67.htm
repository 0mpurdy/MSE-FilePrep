		J.T.<a name=1:2></a> The brethren will be aware that it has been decided, under God, as we trust, to look into the gospel of Matthew in this series of readings.<a name=1:3></a> What underlies this proposal is largely, that the heavenly position of the assembly has been much stressed, and rightly, for it is heavenly, it is the thought now to balance this by considering the assembly as here on earth.<a name=1:4></a> The vessel that was seen by Peter in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10">Acts  10</a>, came down from heaven as a great sheet bound by the four corners.<a name=1:5></a> It was let down to earth, but was received up again into heaven and remained there.<a name=1:6></a> The sheet being bound by the four corners would mean that it was <i>secure</i>; what was in the sheet was also secure, and the creatures were cleansed, as the second voice declared.<a name=1:7></a> Whilst the assembly is heavenly yet its members are historically earthly.<a name=1:8></a> All have been born upon earth, and further, they have been <i>born of God</i> on earth, and Matthew has in mind that these things have an important bearing on us.<a name=1:9></a>

		Pentecost contemplates a large number of persons being converted.<a name=1:10></a> We have no such numbers later, and although, it is said, that the number of the men had become five thousand, the Scripture tells us, that the result of one day's work was three thousand converts.<a name=1:11></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:41">Acts  2:41</a>.<a name=1:12></a> It is believed that Matthew has all this in mind.<a name=1:13></a> The stability and reliability of what is of God in christianity is in mind and also the distinction attached to it, even as to the personnel and their ancestry; whence they came and how they were here for God, running on through the generations under the

		It is thought that the Lord will help us to look into things from this standpoint, but especially to see the character of the persons that are in mind and mentioned with such evident accuracy under the formal heads of three fourteens.<a name=2:5></a> So that we may well repeat Solomon's word: "Thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people", <a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#3:8">1 Kings  3:8</a>.<a name=2:6></a> They are not great in the human or outward sense, but they are according to God; not only because they are going to be in heaven, but because of their present stability and reliability.<a name=2:7></a> These generations were stable.<a name=2:8></a> Men who are mentioned in the list were of the highest character whom God honoured and used.<a name=2:9></a> The genealogy therefore runs down through them to the Christ.<a name=2:10></a> So that the Lord's own genealogy is honourable in that sense, especially in Joseph the husband of Mary being so distinguished.<a name=2:11></a> We have here, "Book of the generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham".<a name=2:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:13></a> He is not great enough.<a name=3:14></a> He is discredited almost at the outset.<a name=3:15></a> In Genesis, however, we have, "This is the book of Adam's generations", but clearly God must <i>directly</i> choose Christ's generation.<a name=3:16></a> There were persons of great distinction prior to Abraham but God is not thinking of them here.<a name=3:17></a> In Matthew, certain ones are rejected from the line of the kings because their parents were not suitable; although they were in the line of David they are left out as unsuitable.<a name=3:18></a> God did not see that it would honour the line to leave them in.<a name=3:19></a> I think, if we see that God is making a careful selection of these generations, and that He has His own mind in making up the list, then we shall see that the persons are great and suitable from His point of view.<a name=3:20></a>

		J.T.<a name=3:24></a> They are great by reason of the work of God in them even though there may be discrediting things about them, as there are about all of us.<a name=3:25></a> The discrediting things that have happened in our lives do not set aside the greatness that we have from God's point of view.<a name=3:26></a> I believe that John supports Matthew in that sense, showing that we are children of God, the right having been given to us to take that place as believing on His name, "who have been born, not of blood, nor of flesh's will, nor of man's will, but of God".<a name=3:27></a> It is a question of family distinction or glory which is granted

		J.T.<a name=4:17></a> Very good!<a name=4:18></a> Solomon was a son unto his father and Isaac went up to mount Moriah doing the will of his father.<a name=4:19></a> These two sons bring out, typically, the unique character of our Lord's sonship.<a name=4:20></a>

		J.T.<a name=6:4></a> Well, it is a question of the Christ.<a name=6:5></a> The Samaritan woman said, "Is not He the Christ?<a name=6:6></a>" as if she were a person who would find out.<a name=6:7></a> She asked a question, but the Lord had told her who He was: "I who speak to thee am he".<a name=6:8></a> So that there are those who find things out by inquiry in the temple of God as it says, ".<a name=6:9></a>.<a name=6:10></a>.<a name=6:11></a> and to inquire of him in his temple", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#27:4">Psalm  27:4</a>.<a name=6:12></a> We find things out by inquiry in the temple of God.<a name=6:13></a>

		A.B.<a name=6:14></a>P.<a name=6:15></a> Does the name Jesus involve mystery?<a name=6:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:17></a> Well, that is a proper question to bring up, because the word in verse 21 is, "Thou shalt call his name Jesus".<a name=6:18></a> We have already been speaking about the brethren and what we are called, that is, "children of God"!<a name=6:19></a> But here it says, "And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus".<a name=6:20></a> Joseph is to give the name.<a name=6:21></a> And then it goes on to say, ".<a name=6:22></a>.<a name=6:23></a>.<a name=6:24></a> for <i>he</i> shall save his people from their sins".<a name=6:25></a> Thus the idea of saviour is involved in the name Jesus.<a name=6:26></a> Then the last verse says, that Joseph "knew her not until she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name Jesus".<a name=6:27></a> And then there is another word which is to be noted, in verse 23: "Behold the virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which is, bring interpreted, 'God with us'".<a name=6:28></a> So that what is said under the heading of name is remarkable, both as to Emmanuel and as to Jesus.<a name=6:29></a> There is a footnote, referring to the name Joshua, in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#17:9">Exodus  17:9</a>, which reads, 'Jah the Saviour, called Jesus in Greek: see <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#4:8">Hebrews  4:8</a>'.<a name=6:30></a> So that I think we may say that there is mystery in the name.<a name=6:31></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:3></a> Just so; <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:3">John  1:3</a> and <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:16">Colossians  1:16</a> show that He is the <i>active</i> One in the Godhead.<a name=7:4></a> As to what was said of Matthew at the beginning of the meeting, it is not simply that we are to be with Him in heaven, but He is with us here; in Matthew it is "God with us".<a name=7:5></a> God is here tonight with us.<a name=7:6></a>

		J.T.<a name=8:26></a> I suppose it would be symbolical in that chapter.<a name=8:27></a> It is the great conflict called the battle of Rephidim.<a name=8:28></a> It is said, "For the hand is on the throne of Jah; Jehovah will have war with Amalek from generation to generation!<a name=8:29></a>" The word generation is not to be overlooked because we are dealing with generations here and the war is going on.<a name=8:30></a> It would be Amalek in the spiritual meaning, as alluding to the devil acting through the flesh.<a name=8:31></a> It is what the flesh is as representing Satan and the combat goes on.<a name=8:32></a> Hence it says in Ephesians, "Our struggle is not against blood and flesh, but against principalities, against authorities, against the universal lords of this darkness, against spiritual power of wickedness in the heavenlies", chapter 6: 12.<a name=8:33></a> I think the passage in Exodus serves us well, not only as to the Lord's name, but as to His

	<div class="paragraph">
		This chapter brings before us the discipline which the assembly is called upon to exercise in regard to persons who have been identified with a wicked course.<a name=38:1></a> An extreme case of sin is before us in this chapter.<a name=38:2></a> At the same time the principles which apply in dealing with matters of evil, and light governing the assembly in such matters come out also.<a name=38:3></a> While we do not act in the formal way of delivering to Satan, or removing from ourselves the wicked person, yet we act in the light of that in withdrawing from evil.<a name=38:4></a> We are to "withdraw from iniquity".<a name=38:5></a> The assembly enters into that.<a name=38:6></a> "Let every one who names the name of the Lord withdraw from iniquity", <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:19">2 Timothy  2:19</a>.<a name=38:7></a> Whilst that is an individual thought, yet we move into it together.<a name=38:8></a> We have here, as also in 2 Timothy, the name of the Lord.<a name=38:9></a> As having to separate from wicked persons the assembly acts, and associated with that act is the power which the Lord's name brings in.<a name=38:10></a> It is not merely that persons do it; it is the assembly that does it.<a name=38:11></a> So that it is the entirety of the saints who "call upon the Lord", moving together as in the city, and arriving at the necessity of separating from a certain person.<a name=38:12></a> As divine principles govern us, one mind as to the matter is reached through the light afforded and through the affections of the saints for Christ and for one another being in action.<a name=38:13></a>

		Then the apostle immediately refers to two feasts; that is, the passover and the feast of unleavened bread.<a name=38:14></a> These are both rituals from the old economy brought forward to show how they apply to ourselves.<a name=38:15></a> The Old Testament is made serviceable to us in these matters.<a name=38:16></a> So that when we exercise discipline, which, alas, we have to do at times, these two feasts should come immediately into our minds.<a name=38:17></a> It is as if the saints need to be reminded of what has been effected by Christ,

		and that, perhaps, it has lost its force with some of our number and therefore evil has occurred.<a name=39:1></a> The consideration of these feasts would take us back to Exodus.<a name=39:2></a> As we know, the passover especially refers to the initial deliverance of the Israelites; how they were saved from the destroying angel, who, when he saw the blood of the lamb on the doorposts and on the lintels of their houses, passed over them.<a name=39:3></a> Here, you will notice, Satan is used for the destruction of the flesh.<a name=39:4></a> Evil having come in, Satan is used for the destruction of the flesh in the person who has sinned, that his spirit might be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.<a name=39:5></a> So that the passover would come into the apostle's mind and he would enforce the meaning of this feast -- also that of unleavened bread.<a name=39:6></a> This side of things was, perhaps, lacking at Corinth, and it should come up in our minds also, as we are exercised, to bring about a better state with us.<a name=39:7></a> As necessary discipline is exercised, it should bring about better conditions in our localities.<a name=39:8></a> The passover is not linked with the Supper in this chapter, as has been pointed out to us recently.<a name=39:9></a> It is linked up with the Supper in the gospels, but not here; meaning, I think, that right moral conditions are to be established before the truth of the Supper is brought forward in chapter 11.<a name=39:10></a> The intervening chapters have that in mind -- that a better condition of things might be brought about at Corinth.<a name=39:11></a> And the Lord is aiming at that amongst us; that is, to bring about better conditions.<a name=39:12></a> So that, in going back to the institution of the passover, we would read <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#12">Exodus  12</a>and 13.<a name=39:13></a> It is good that we should know these chapters; how the Israelites were protected and what was effected, typically -- especially considering the suffering side that is connected with the passover, for the passover lamb was roast with fire.<a name=39:14></a> "For also our passover, Christ, has been sacrificed".<a name=39:15></a> The allusion is to suffering; the suffering was not mitigated; the action of the fire was direct and powerful,

		and it refers to the way Christ suffered.<a name=40:1></a> All this is brought up in this chapter because of the allowance of sin in us, in whatever form it may take, and is intended to take us back to these things so that we may get right in what is initial -- the beginning of our histories in relation to Christ.<a name=40:2></a> The great beginning for us is the cross, from the standpoint of sacrifice, and it is important to understand that "Christ indeed has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God", <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#3:8">1 Peter  3:8</a>.<a name=40:3></a> And again, as we have in Hebrews: "Wherefore also Jesus, that he might sanctify the people by his own blood, suffered without the gate: therefore let us go forth to him without the camp", chapter 13: 12, 13.<a name=40:4></a> These references to the sufferings of Christ should lead us to right thoughts as to ourselves.<a name=40:5></a> And then, coupled with that is the feast of unleavened bread, which refers to our state being in keeping with the death of Christ.<a name=40:6></a> All this is intended to affect us so that we might move on in intelligent conformity to these things and be ready for the light of the Supper, for we hardly know what we are doing unless we pass this way.<a name=40:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The allusion to the leaven here is most instructive for us, for it is possible that the matter for which a person must be dealt with may spread.<a name=40:8></a> The leaven would allude to the way evil has its effect in persons who may be immediately connected with the person involved, or who is under his influence, or is sympathetic with such, and therefore the need of being rigid as to this; each one of us dealing with the leaven that might be in his heart -- and often is there.<a name=40:9></a> So the apostle uses this strong word: "Purge out the old leaven".<a name=40:10></a> Purge it out!<a name=40:11></a> It is the old leaven!<a name=40:12></a> ".<a name=40:13></a>.<a name=40:14></a>.<a name=40:15></a> that ye may be a new lump".<a name=40:16></a> That is the idea of a new position, involving better conditions.<a name=40:17></a> It is not that we do not sorrow over those who are dealt with, because the point in mind here, in regard to such a person, is that he might be saved: ".<a name=40:18></a>.<a name=40:19></a>.<a name=40:20></a> that the spirit may be saved in the day of the

		Lord Jesus".<a name=41:1></a> We never lose sight of that in regard to persons with whom we must deal in discipline.<a name=41:2></a> There have been many cases of sorrow in this city.<a name=41:3></a> We should think of all such in that way; but at the same time, the Lord is looking at our state, as of the assembly, and we must purge out the old leaven.<a name=41:4></a> And so the word is, "So that let us celebrate the feast".<a name=41:5></a> The children of Israel were to keep it seven days, which refers to the whole of the believer's time down here.<a name=41:6></a> It is, "not with old leaven, nor with leaven of malice and wickedness".<a name=41:7></a> The apostle, in alluding to these things, had in mind that the state of the Corinthians might change for the better, and so he goes on to say, ".<a name=41:8></a>.<a name=41:9></a>.<a name=41:10></a> but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth".<a name=41:11></a> May every one of us move in sincerity, which involves that we are not double-minded, but that we are free and clear from all personal feeling: and then, that the truth may govern us in our feasts!<a name=41:12></a>

		READINGS IN MATTHEW'S GOSPEL (4)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#5:1">Matthew  5:1</a> - 26; <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#7:24">Matthew  7:24</a> - 29
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=65:1></a> We are all aware that this series of readings is in the gospel of Matthew.<a name=65:2></a> At the opening reading attention was called to the fact that the ascension of Christ is not mentioned in this gospel.<a name=65:3></a> On the other hand, it was pointed out that the Lord speaks of Himself, in the gospel, as with the disciples all the days, until the completion of the age; so that stability is suggested, not from the standpoint of what is in heaven or of our heavenly relations, but because of what is here on earth.<a name=65:4></a> The Lord Himself promised that He would be with the disciples throughout the dispensation, and then the Spirit would be here, although that is not stressed so much, but clearly it is in mind, to be apprehended throughout the gospel.<a name=65:5></a> And then another feature is the mountains which come into evidence, which goes with the idea of stability, as has been remarked.<a name=65:6></a> They involve stability and conspicuousness, not as heavenly bodies or what is in heaven, but what is present on earth in the sense of stability.<a name=65:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=65:8></a> What is conspicuous <i>here</i>?<a name=65:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=65:10></a> Yes; what is here is just the point.<a name=65:11></a> It says, "But seeing the crowds, he went up into the mountain".<a name=65:12></a> It is over against the plain or valley.<a name=65:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=65:14></a> Why is it called <i>the</i> mountain?<a name=65:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=65:16></a> The article points to the characteristics of the mountain.<a name=65:17></a> It is over against the idea of the plain or the valley and is a well-known expression in countries which have mountains.<a name=65:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=65:21></a> That is the idea of it, I think.<a name=65:22></a> The reference is in the Songs of degrees, or ascent, which would carry with it just what we have been saying.<a name=65:23></a> The mountains are round about Jerusalem; so that the idea

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.F.<a name=66:2></a>K.<a name=66:3></a> Is this teaching in the mount only for disciples?<a name=66:4></a> It says that His disciples came to Him there.<a name=66:5></a> Is that a higher spiritual elevation?<a name=66:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=66:7></a> Just so; the idea of the mountain runs right through.<a name=66:8></a> Chapter 4 has one but it is hardly in keeping with what we are saying now.<a name=66:9></a> It is the one to which the devil took the Lord.<a name=66:10></a> It is said, "Again the devil takes him to a very high mountain, and shows him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory", verse 8.<a name=66:11></a> It is a similar thought, only the enemy is taking advantage of it to attempt to mislead the Lord.<a name=66:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.A.<a name=66:13></a>T.<a name=66:14></a> It says, in chapter 8, that when He came down from the mountain He met a leper.<a name=66:15></a> Is that in the plain?<a name=66:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=66:17></a> Exactly.<a name=66:18></a> It points to what is in the plain.<a name=66:19></a> We shall see more later in this inquiry, perhaps, as to chapter 8 and also chapter 17 where we have a similar allusion to what the Lord found after He came down from the mount of transfiguration.<a name=66:20></a> In chapter 14: 23 the Lord went up into a mountain apart to pray; a mountain is also referred to in chapter 15: 29, where it says that He sat down; then in chapter 17: 1 we have "a high mountain", which we often refer to as the mount of transfiguration; then in chapter 24 we are told that Jesus "was sitting upon the mount of Olives"; and in chapter 28 the disciples went to Galilee to the mountain which Jesus had appointed.<a name=66:21></a> So that the idea runs right through the book and may be well regarded as denoting what is available, in the sense of mountains, for protection.<a name=66:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.I.<a name=66:23></a> Would the disciples be in keeping with what the Lord was doing?<a name=66:24></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=68:8></a> It would be the strength that goes with authority when it is of God.<a name=68:9></a> And, of course, this was of God.<a name=68:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=68:14></a> Just so.<a name=68:15></a> What we have already remarked as to stability is that it belongs to the assembly, really.<a name=68:16></a> In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#15">Acts  15</a>we have the idea of what is stable set out in certain who were pillars; who were a source of strength in the assembly.<a name=68:17></a> Peter would be one, as <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:9">Galatians  2:9</a> shows.<a name=68:18></a> He would be a source of strength through divinely given stability.<a name=68:19></a> Stability is implied in this gospel.<a name=68:20></a> It is not exactly support from the heavenly side, by what comes down from heaven.<a name=68:21></a> That is found in the Acts.<a name=68:22></a> It is what arises in view of the Spirit being here; and of course, the Spirit being here involves a way for Christ being here.<a name=68:23></a> It is a way for the Lord being here.<a name=68:24></a> So that we have men who are truly pillars alluded to in that chapter, and they are actually called that in Galatians.<a name=68:25></a> And these meetings, which we have from time to time, are intended to be occasions of strength.<a name=68:26></a> The brethren are sustained in this way by instruction, and by example, and by fellowship.<a name=68:27></a> Where should we be without such meetings?<a name=68:28></a> Where should we be without the assembly and all that it involves?<a name=68:29></a> We come together and acquire strength mutually by coming together; but then the Lord adds to that, saying, "Where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:20">Matthew  18:20</a>.<a name=68:30></a> He is there for support; so that Matthew stresses the feature of strength, but

		J.T.<a name=89:1></a> Mention has been made of the references to <i>mountains</i> in this gospel.<a name=89:2></a> We noted at the last meeting that in chapter 5 it is said: "But seeing the crowds, he went up into the mountain, and having sat down, his disciples came to him; and, having opened his mouth, he taught them", verses 1, 2.<a name=89:3></a> That chapter begins the subject of mountains; although chapter 4 mentions one, but it hardly fits in with the subject, because it is one that the devil used in connection with one of the temptations.<a name=89:4></a> Chapter 5, therefore, properly begins the subject of mountains, as we were saying, which would direct our minds to the word in the Psalms that Jerusalem is encompassed with mountains in the sense of protection.<a name=89:5></a> "Jerusalem!<a name=89:6></a> -- mountains are round about her, and Jehovah is round about his people, from henceforth and for evermore", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#125:2">Psalm  125:2</a>.<a name=89:7></a> The teaching on the mountain runs on to the end of chapter 7, where it is said, "And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these words, the crowds were astonished at his doctrine, for he taught them as having authority".<a name=89:8></a> Then in verse 1 of chapter 8, it says, "And when he had come down from the mountain, great crowds followed him".<a name=89:9></a> So that now He has come down from the mountain to the plain; and therefore we have to consider chapter 8 with this in mind.<a name=89:10></a> It affords us much instruction as to what happened on the plain, because it refers to the Lord's work, not so much in the sense of teaching, but <i>healing</i>.<a name=89:11></a> The subject runs on to the end of chapter 9, where we are told, "And Jesus went round all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the glad tidings of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every bodily weakness".<a name=89:12></a> And then it says further, "But when he saw the crowds he was moved with compassion

		for them, because they were harassed, and cast away as sheep not having a shepherd.<a name=90:1></a> Then saith he to his disciples, The harvest is great and the workmen are few; supplicate therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he send forth workmen unto his harvest".<a name=90:2></a> So that we have in these two chapters the Lord's immediate work, not so much in teaching, as in preaching and in healing.<a name=90:3></a> And the first case is the leper.<a name=90:4></a> Then we have, in verse 5, a centurion coming to Him and seeking help for his servant who was paralysed.<a name=90:5></a> And then, verse 14: "When Jesus had come to Peter's house, he saw his mother-in-law laid down and in a fever".<a name=90:6></a> Verse 16 says, "And when the evening was come, they brought to him many possessed by demons".<a name=90:7></a> Thus we have one instance after another in the sense of healing.<a name=90:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=90:11></a> Yes; that is just what I think.<a name=90:12></a> First, the mountain, or mountains, for there are six of them engaged in this sense, contemplate the administrative service of the Lord, but the plain would be the meeting of the need in humanity to bring about what corresponds to the teaching.<a name=90:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=90:17></a> Well, I think so.<a name=90:18></a> The subject of leprosy is defined in Leviticus, and clearly the allusion is to persons who have a place amongst God's people.<a name=90:19></a> And if one such is a leper, of course, he has to be dealt with as such.<a name=90:20></a> That is what is in mind.<a name=90:21></a> But I should say that the subject of leprosy in itself refers to sin in its working in unconverted persons.<a name=90:22></a> <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#5">Luke  5</a>illustrates this, for the man in verse 12, is said to be "full of leprosy", and this

		J.T.<a name=91:15></a> I think to make provision for the old economy, seeing that it was not yet abandoned.<a name=91:16></a> We were noticing at the last reading that in Matthew the Lord takes up whatever can be used.<a name=91:17></a> He says, in chapter 5, "Think not that I am come to make void the law or the prophets; I am not come to make void, but to fulfil".<a name=91:18></a> So Matthew would say, Whatever is usable should be used; hence the priest is still usable.<a name=91:19></a>

		J.T.<a name=110:1></a> According to chapters 8 and 9, the Lord has been doing much.<a name=110:2></a> We have an earlier record at the end of chapter 4, but these two chapters bear on it peculiarly, so that there is abundant evidence in them of how the Lord did things, and of the results in certain persons.<a name=110:3></a> Now it is thought that chapter 10 affords us instruction as to the special character of divine work as seen in the service of the apostles.<a name=110:4></a> They were to do greater works than He, because He would go to the Father, but the chapter indicates how the work is to be done, what is needed in the sense of strength of fibre, and what were the vicissitudes that would have to be entered upon.<a name=110:5></a> The closing verses bring in the idea of the reception of the ministers: "He that receives you receives me, and he that receives me receives him that sent me.<a name=110:6></a> He that receives a prophet in the name of a prophet, shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, shall receive a righteous man's reward.<a name=110:7></a> And whosoever shall give to drink to one of these little ones a cup of cold water only, in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward".<a name=110:8></a>

		J.T.<a name=134:1></a> So as to make clear the links which are in mind in the chapter, we may look first at the beginning of chapter 11.<a name=134:2></a> It says, "And it came to pass when Jesus had finished commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and preach in their cities".<a name=134:3></a> The Lord, according to chapter 10, has appointed His twelve disciples.<a name=134:4></a> He named them apostles showing that their position was authoritative.<a name=134:5></a> Then, in chapter 11 the Lord Himself resumes His teaching.<a name=134:6></a> So that, as we have noted, it says, "when Jesus had finished commanding his twelve disciples".<a name=134:7></a> Such finishing thoughts are characteristic of Matthew and are important as pointing out certain sections of the book, and particularly here as relating to apostolic service.<a name=134:8></a> The instruction was finished.<a name=134:9></a> After that we have the allusion to John's mission, which, alas, is discreditable to John.<a name=134:10></a> He sent his disciples to ask the Lord, "Art thou the coming one?<a name=134:11></a> or are we to wait for another?<a name=134:12></a>" verse 3.<a name=134:13></a> The principle of finishing matters is important to bear in mind in the instruction, and it is clear that this was needed in John's case.<a name=134:14></a>

		J.T.<a name=165:1></a> I see what you mean.<a name=165:2></a> Verse 32 says, "And when they had gone up into the ship, the wind fell"; that is to say, the Lord came into the ship, which corresponds with what we are saying as to <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>.<a name=165:3></a> The Lord had led them out as far as to Bethany, and He went up from Bethany.<a name=165:4></a> It does not say that He went up from the mount of Olives.<a name=165:5></a> He went up from Bethany; that is to suggest that He still remains in relation to Judaism in Luke.<a name=165:6></a> He went up from Bethany.<a name=165:7></a> But in chapter 1 of the Acts, which would probably allude to the same position, the inference is that He went up from the mount of Olives, which would mean that in our minds we have to move on from Bethany.<a name=165:8></a> Even from Bethany we have to move on.<a name=165:9></a> We have to move to the position that leads up to the assembly, and going up from the mount of Olives would be nearer to the truth of the assembly than going up from Bethany.<a name=165:10></a> Bethany was a place of love, but in Israel.<a name=165:11></a> It is particularly a type of the position in Israel, but the mount of Olives was more than that.<a name=165:12></a> It was a heavenly relation.<a name=165:13></a>

		the Lord's supper.<a name=225:1></a> The Lord's supper, as seen in Matthew, has become more prominent historically than in any other of the gospels, although Luke gives a clearer view of it than Matthew does; but the reformers and others selected Matthew to teach us as to the Lord's supper.<a name=225:2></a> And what took place in the house of Simon the leper would be especially in our minds, because it is a question of the Lord as Head, thus linking us on with <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11">1 Corinthians  11</a>.<a name=225:3></a> The Lord said of the woman who anointed Him, that "wheresoever these glad tidings may be preached in the whole world, that also which this woman has done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her", verse 13.<a name=225:4></a> So that what she did is carried down in regard of the gospel, wherever the gospel is preached.<a name=225:5></a> We are reminded that in preaching the gospel we must pay attention to what this woman did and see that there is accuracy and that no worldly principles are allowed in the preaching of the gospel.<a name=225:6></a> What she did involves the Lord's supper and the order of it.<a name=225:7></a>

		J.T.<a name=226:4></a> It says in verse 20, "And when the evening was come he lay down at table with the twelve".<a name=226:5></a> They are mentioned in Mark and Luke also, but Matthew especially mentions that "when the evening was come he lay down at table with the twelve".<a name=226:6></a> The Lord's supper is in mind, but administration is in mind also, so that He sees to it that the twelve are there, that the administrative number is there, so that things are done in order.<a name=226:7></a> I believe, therefore, that we should keep in mind that order enters into the matter of the Lord's supper in Matthew's gospel.<a name=226:8></a> It is very important that it should be in mind; that things should be in order because the subject is enlarged on in 1 Corinthians.<a name=226:9></a>

		COMMENTS ON THE IDENTITY OF THE BEASTS OF REVELATION 13 AND THE MAN OF SIN OF 2 THESSALONIANS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The man of sin, as described in <a href="../bible/2Thessalonians.htm#2">2 Thessalonians  2</a>, is referred to as somewhat covering both beasts of <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#13">Revelation  13</a>.<a name=247:1></a> The man of sin embraces more than is stated of the second beast.<a name=247:2></a> He opposes and exalts himself on high against all called God, or object of veneration; so that he himself sits down in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God, verse 4.<a name=247:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second beast, in a general way, is engaged in making the first beast all this.<a name=247:4></a> He exercises all the authority of the first beast before it, and causes the earth and those who dwell in it to do homage to the first beast.<a name=247:5></a> The first beast is more anti-God than anti-Christ, and this marks the man of sin as seen in <a href="../bible/2Thessalonians.htm#2">2 Thessalonians  2</a>.<a name=247:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The idea of beast in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#13">Revelation  13</a>includes a system or empire, and no doubt the second beast, comparing what is said of him in Daniel, is the head of a kingdom in the East, subordinate to the emperor of the West, but each system is clearly identified with its head -- both <i>men</i>, as Revelation clearly shows, for both are cast into the lake of fire.<a name=247:7></a> The first beast is clearly the revived Roman Empire; but still, he opens his mouth in blasphemies against God, in keeping with what is said of the man of sin in <a href="../bible/2Thessalonians.htm#2">2 Thessalonians  2</a>.<a name=247:8></a> He is said to be the object of worship before the second beast is introduced, and then the latter is seen as operating to bring all to worship the first beast -- not himself.<a name=247:9></a>

		J.T.<a name=402:1></a> We were reminded on the last occasion that chapter 1 has a certain distinguishing character; that is, the truth is presented abstractly; hence the statements beginning with verse 4: "I thank my God always about you, in respect of the grace of God given to you in Christ Jesus; that in everything ye have been enriched in him, in all word of doctrine, and all knowledge (according as the testimony of the Christ has been confirmed in you), so that ye come short in no gift, awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ".<a name=402:2></a> It was remarked, as already said, that there is an abstract character to this passage, making it really objective truth, but so stated in order to lay the basis of what the apostle had in his mind to bring forth in regard to local conditions.<a name=402:3></a> Therefore it might be wondered that the beginning of this chapter 3 says, "<i>I</i>, brethren, have not been able to speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly; as to babes in Christ.<a name=402:4></a> I have given you milk to drink, not meat, for ye have not yet been able, nor indeed are ye yet able; for ye are yet carnal".<a name=402:5></a> Now these statements may cause some inquiry as compared with what we have read from the first chapter, but what has been said is important to bear in mind, that the first chapter deals with the truth in the abstract, and this chapter deals with the actual state of things in Corinth.<a name=402:6></a>

		A.B.<a name=402:7></a>P.<a name=402:8></a> Is it possible that the condition or state of some may be used as representative of the company, so that the apostle may rightly speak of a higher state than existed in the main, having the few in mind?<a name=402:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=402:10></a> I think that is possible, especially when we take notice of such a person as Chloe (chapter 1: 11), "For it has been shewn to me concerning you, my brethren, by those of the house of Chloe, that there are

		strifes among you".<a name=403:1></a> Apparently she would be one that lived there who was reliable, and of course there may have been many others; we would trust so.<a name=403:2></a> But at the same time what has been remarked about the first chapter as compared with this is to be noted, that there was generally a very low state amongst them.<a name=403:3></a> And the second epistle brings out that there was a very serious condition, in a way one of the worst conditions imaginable; so that you wonder at it.<a name=403:4></a> Paul says, he had the readiness to avenge all disobedience (a very strong word) when their obedience was fulfilled; that is, when the mass of the brethren got right.<a name=403:5></a> So that we have to look at what is actually said here and seek to bring the truth home to ourselves according to what is said.<a name=403:6></a> There may be those here who are fleshly.<a name=403:7></a> We would not imply that, only we have to face the actual facts that there were a large number of such in Corinth.<a name=403:8></a> And, of course, there are a goodly number of brethren here in this city, so that the question is as to what their state is.<a name=403:9></a> The thought is not to drag the brethren down to occupation with a low state of things, but to elevate them out of it as much as possible.<a name=403:10></a> Still, we have to face the facts.<a name=403:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.R.<a name=403:12></a> It says in verse 3, "there are among you emulation and strife".<a name=403:13></a> That does not include everybody, does it?<a name=403:14></a> I suppose that would make allowance for such as the house of Chloe?<a name=403:15></a>

		J.T.<a name=403:16></a> Yet the word was for everybody.<a name=403:17></a> She would have to listen to it if she were there; but undoubtedly she felt everything, and of course that is a great matter.<a name=403:18></a> We can confidently count that in every gathering of the saints there are those who are reliable.<a name=403:19></a> On the other hand there may be those who are not, and we have to bear them in mind.<a name=403:20></a>

		J.T.<a name=404:8></a> Just so.<a name=404:9></a> The word <i>fleshly</i> in verse 1, according to the footnote in the New Translation, is said to mean 'properly the material -- the composition of a thing'.<a name=404:10></a> That is important.<a name=404:11></a> The word <i>carnal</i> occurs twice in verse 3 and, as the footnote says, is 'used, in some places, to express either material or physical or moral ideas'.<a name=404:12></a> So that the words <i>carnal</i> and <i>natural</i> run together.<a name=404:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=446:1></a> The suggestion is to briefly refer to headship in the first part of the chapter so as to link it on with our present thought of the Lord's supper.<a name=446:2></a> The subject begins in verse 2, "Now I praise you, that in all things ye are mindful of me; and that as I have directed you, ye keep the directions.<a name=446:3></a> But I wish you to know that the Christ is the head of every man, but woman's head is the man, and the Christ's head God".<a name=446:4></a> It is thought that the subject of headship fits in peculiarly as introductory to the Lord's supper in the service of God.<a name=446:5></a> The tendency with us is to have our own thoughts about things, and hence the subject of headship would tend to regulate us and keep us subject.<a name=446:6></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=446:10></a> I would think so, especially because of the reference to the hair, and that it is given to the woman for a covering.<a name=446:11></a> Many take that to mean that it settles the whole matter, that the hair as a covering is enough, but it is not so; because the apostle says if a woman have not long hair she should be shaved, which is very drastic, and it shows how much the matter is in the mind of the Spirit of God, as to the public appearance and order of the assembly.<a name=446:12></a>

		I mention all this in relation to the first scripture read because the Lord Jesus shines before us in it, transfigured before the disciples on the mount.<a name=464:7></a> Peter was affected by it and he speaks later about it, saying, "For we have not made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, following cleverly imagined fables, but having been eyewitnesses of <i>his</i> majesty", <a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#1:16">2 Peter  1:16</a>.<a name=464:8></a> Think of what their eyes had seen!<a name=464:9></a> We need to see things, too.<a name=464:10></a> We need to get into the position where we can see things.<a name=464:11></a> It may be in the presence of other distinguished disciples, it may be in meetings such as these.<a name=464:12></a> We want to have our eyes open to see what is taking place as we are together.<a name=464:13></a> The Lord took these three disciples up in the mountain apart, and He was transfigured before them.<a name=464:14></a> And so the Lord takes us on that He might show us things; that we might see things and be developed in order that we might hear the wonderful acclamation from heaven about Christ, "<i>This</i> is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight".<a name=464:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The inward side of the truth is so necessary at the present time, it is that God finds delight in us -- in persons.<a name=464:16></a> In our scripture it is not exactly what Christ has been doing that is referred to, but the Person in whom God has found His delight.<a name=464:17></a> What there was in Him!<a name=464:18></a> And so, in regard to the offerings in Leviticus, we are told that they were divided and the inwards were washed with water, meaning that they were made types of Christ by the washing of the water.<a name=464:19></a> He needed no washing, as we well know!<a name=464:20></a> The more we think of that the more we grow in our souls.<a name=464:21></a> "Him who knew

	<div class="paragraph">
		So in a corresponding way God is now looking to find His delight in men; first of all in His servants and then in all those who are of the assembly, we may say.<a name=465:6></a> He looked for delight in Peter, and in James and John, and He found it, too.<a name=465:7></a> He found it in the twelve when they stood up at Pentecost.<a name=465:8></a> There were twelve, and what a delight for heaven!<a name=465:9></a> Think of what was resident in those men as they stood together -- what an accumulation of experience was there!<a name=465:10></a> Therefore, as those who would be in the service, we need to be kept, and especially the younger brethren.<a name=465:11></a> When we get older, perhaps we have more control and a greater knowledge of the enemy's devices.<a name=465:12></a> We may be more able to meet the enemy as we get older, but when we are younger the enemy is apt to discover where we are weak and render us unserviceable.<a name=465:13></a> But John says that the young men are strong and that they have overcome the world and the wicked one.<a name=465:14></a> Therefore we can see the need of our younger men laying themselves out to protect themselves against what the enemy would bring in.<a name=465:15></a>

		HEADSHIP BELONGING TO THE WILDERNESS POSITION

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=479:2></a> This scripture is proposed as bringing out the feature of headship that <i>belongs to the wilderness position</i>; hence the order in which it is given in this chapter, "that the Christ is the head of every man", verse 3, which has to be taken as general, and then, "but woman's head is the man, and the Christ's head God".<a name=479:3></a> That is the public position.<a name=479:4></a> Headship in Colossians and Ephesians is more inward, bearing on the words 'Son' and 'eternity'; it has a more spiritual nature, dealing not only with believers, or those in the assembly, but including those in the millennium and those in eternal bliss.<a name=479:5></a> Headship runs through.<a name=479:6></a> But this epistle has to do with it in its public relations now, so it is said, "every man".<a name=479:7></a> The types help us as usual; it is the position in the wilderness.<a name=479:8></a> The idea of the acknowledgment of headship is very slight in the wilderness, whether it be in Zipporah or in the later wife that Moses had; there is very little said as to what they were personally.<a name=479:9></a>

		J.S.<a name=479:10></a> Does headship necessarily involve the body?<a name=479:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=479:12></a> Well, we will hardly get to that part yet.<a name=479:13></a> It is 'every man' here, and the head of every woman is the man, and the Christ's head is God.<a name=479:14></a> So that it is the general position in creation that is in mind.<a name=479:15></a>

		J.T.<a name=480:9></a> It is clearly subjection in each of us, but it is a public matter.<a name=480:10></a> It is a testimony that Christ is Head of every man.<a name=480:11></a> So that it is what comes under men's eyes as a testimony; not simply what appears in the assembly in its varied functions, but the testimony to Christ's rights over all men, and how it is the ordering of God that God is Christ's Head, and the head of every woman is the man, whoever the man may be, or whoever the woman may be.<a name=480:12></a> It is a testimony to God in creation, and it stands now.<a name=480:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=543:1></a> Attention should be called to the importance of Scripture, and that the Old Testament has the same relative value as the New Testament; and so also the typical teaching of the Old Testament has its own value, and has the authority of Scripture.<a name=543:2></a> I am afraid that there is a danger in certain quarters of persons assuming that the New Testament has greater value than the Old.<a name=543:3></a> When the Lord was here He quoted from the Scriptures.<a name=543:4></a> In the 10th of John He quoted a scripture, saying as to it, "and the scripture cannot be broken", verse 35.<a name=543:5></a> And so I think it is well to warn the brethren, and we all should be warned, as to the importance of Scripture.<a name=543:6></a> We have had it before us that "every scripture is divinely inspired, and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God may be complete, fully fitted to every good work", <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#3:16">2 Timothy  3:16</a>, 17.<a name=543:7></a> The section now before us is one of the most important sections in the Old Testament as containing typical teaching about the Spirit of God and about the assembly.<a name=543:8></a> We must be on our guard not to allow ourselves to slip into error by refusing what is presented in Scripture as typical teaching.<a name=543:9></a> A letter was received from a brother in Croydon this very day calling attention to <a href="../bible/John.htm#7:37">John  7:37</a>, which I will read: "In the last, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried saying, If any one thirst, let him come to me and drink.<a name=543:10></a> He that believes on me, as the scripture has said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water".<a name=543:11></a> Attention is called to the Scripture: "As the scripture has said".<a name=543:12></a> Now this particular scripture can hardly be found, literally, but the Lord says that it is there, and He quotes thus "out of his belly shall flow rivers of living waters".<a name=543:13></a> The chronicler of the gospel by John then records:

		"But this he said concerning the Spirit, which they that believed on him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified", verse 39.<a name=544:1></a> So the Lord quoted something there as Scripture that cannot be determined as such, literally, but still the meaning is there; the Lord means it to be quoted as Scripture; in effect it <i>was</i> Scripture; although as already said we cannot get the literal words in Scripture.<a name=544:2></a> Therefore we ought to be on our guard that we may not find ourselves in error as to the use of the Scriptures, but go by the usage that the Lord and the apostles have made of them.<a name=544:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=544:8></a> Yes, quite; but in the passage with which we are dealing in <a href="../bible/John.htm#7">John  7</a>the writer of the gospel explains what is said: "But this he said concerning the Spirit, which they that believed on him were about to receive".<a name=544:9></a> That is, the writer, the narrator of the gospel of John, adds to what the Lord said.<a name=544:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=544:11></a>Jr.<a name=544:12></a> "As the scripture has said", would need to be taken into consideration, in regard to every scripture, as to what it is saying, what the scripture itself is saying.<a name=544:13></a> And as we are reading out tonight in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24">Genesis  24</a>, it is a question of what that scripture is saying.<a name=544:14></a>

		A.B.<a name=545:17></a>P.<a name=545:18></a> There is a striking passage in 1 Corinthians that illustrates how the apostle Paul regarded the Old Testament: "In the law .<a name=545:19></a>.<a name=545:20></a>.<a name=545:21></a> it is written, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that is treading out corn.<a name=545:22></a> Is God occupied about the oxen, or does he say it altogether for our sakes?<a name=545:23></a> For for our sakes it has been written", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#9:9">1 Corinthians  9:9</a>, 10.<a name=545:24></a> The apostle's use of Scripture confirms what you are saying.<a name=545:25></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.W.<a name=546:11></a> Rebecca did not come into view until after Isaac had been offered up.<a name=546:12></a> I thought that Isaac being offered up typified Christ having died, and indeed risen, because Abraham is recorded as coming back with the servants from the mount, but Isaac is not so mentioned.<a name=546:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=546:14></a> Quite so; and the verse read says, "And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she also has borne sons to thy brother Nahor: Uz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram, and Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel" -- and now there is a bracket here: "(And Bethuel begot Rebecca.<a name=546:15></a>)" It is clearly to identify the one who is to be the bride of Isaac.<a name=546:16></a>

		It seems to me that we ought to seek to arrive at the truth of what the Lord had in His mind when He uttered these words.<a name=565:1></a> Did He take account of the assembly in the light of God's purpose, or did He also include in His mind the wilderness circumstances?<a name=565:2></a> My conviction is that the latter was not in the Lord's thought; but that He contemplated the saints as <i>gathered around Him</i> consequent on His death and resurrection, and so viewed as outside of wilderness conditions.<a name=565:3></a> To apprehend the thing in a concrete way, I think we have to go back to original conditions.<a name=565:4></a> We have to do this to rightly understand any assembly truth; and I would say that, when the saints came together 'in assembly', the Lord came to them and this was realised.<a name=565:5></a> The Spirit does not record, or give examples of the inward working of the assembly viewed in this exalted position after Pentecost.<a name=565:6></a> I think it is left to intelligent affection to find out.<a name=565:7></a> The scene after the Supper when they sang a hymn, is the closest analogy as to the singing, but this was before the Lord's death and resurrection; they were then on Jewish ground.<a name=565:8></a> Afterwards, the disciples would be regarded as His brethren before the Father, as now made known, but, referring to <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>, it is well to remember that it is not the unfolding of assembly truth, but primarily to show the humanity of our Lord.<a name=565:9></a> Therefore, it is not to determine <i>when</i> He sings, but shows that He sings in the midst of the assembly; it is a characteristic function, as also declaring the Father's name to His brethren.<a name=565:10></a>

		It seems clear that the primary thought of the assembly is that those who form it should be together; and its distinctive privileges are thus enjoyed; this will be true literally when we are "caught up together".<a name=565:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		My conviction is that the Lord, in using the precious words recorded in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:12">Hebrews  2:12</a>, did <i>not</i> contemplate the saints as in the wilderness, or in incidental circumstances, but rather as <i>gathered together</i> as the glorious result of His death.<a name=566:3></a> Were one to take the assembly as viewed only in the light of this passage, we would think of it in no other circumstances than as surrounding Christ to "go no more out".<a name=566:4></a> That is, we should not think of the wilderness.<a name=566:5></a> I am therefore afraid that, if we make the praise here to include what may ascend from individuals, as such, we lower its character.<a name=566:6></a> I believe it refers to the assembly as outside all here, and that it extends beyond the present period.<a name=566:7></a> Indeed it does not specially refer to <i>any</i> period.<a name=566:8></a> From another point of view, I believe the words "in the midst" in their ordinary force, mean that the saints are <i>together</i>.<a name=566:9></a>

		THE ASSEMBLY (4)

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=567:1></a> It may be remarked at this particular juncture that there is considerable exercise amongst the brethren as to the types of the assembly which we are considering, but particularly as to Rebecca, in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24">Genesis  24</a>, because that chapter affords so very much about the Spirit.<a name=567:2></a> It has attracted great attention on the part of the brethren in Great Britain and elsewhere, but especially in Great Britain.<a name=567:3></a> Much has been said of it that is very illuminating if we could all follow it, and much was said at our last reading when that chapter was considered.<a name=567:4></a> But much has been said since then, touching on the truth unfolded in the type, the chief servant of Abraham's house being the leading personage in the chapter, along with Rebecca and Isaac, and being regarded as a type of the Holy Spirit.<a name=567:5></a> It has been noticed from time to time in looking into it that the name of the servant is not given; that is, he is spoken of as the chief servant of Abraham's house.<a name=567:6></a> Much has been said as to him, because the Lord seems to have in mind that we should have the Holy Spirit before us, especially as viewed in this type in relation to Isaac and Rebecca.<a name=567:7></a> It is not suggested that we now go back to what was considered at the last reading, because there would be no need for that.<a name=567:8></a> I think it was fairly well dealt with, and there is hardly time to revert to what we had then.<a name=567:9></a> But I mention all this to lead up to the truth that is now before us, so that the brethren may see that the truth of the Holy Spirit is involved in it, implying, as the type shows, that He is spoken to.<a name=567:10></a> The servant spoke to Rebecca and Rebecca spoke to him.<a name=567:11></a> So that the inference is clear that those of us who form the assembly are being spoken to; the Spirit of God is speaking to us, and it is our privilege to speak to Him, and profit from all that enters into that.<a name=567:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=568:13></a> That is a very suggestive remark, that there is such a hindrance as that.<a name=568:14></a> The stone has to be removed from the well's mouth, and Jacob did that; he rendered that service.<a name=568:15></a>

		J.T.<a name=569:2></a> Well, that might be amplified by reference to <a href="../bible/John.htm#7:39">John  7:39</a>; the word there is, "the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified".<a name=569:3></a> But now He is glorified, and the Spirit has come.<a name=569:4></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.W.<a name=569:18></a>S.<a name=569:19></a> In the allusion to the stone on the mouth of the well in our chapter it says, in verse 3, that when all the flocks were gathered together they rolled the stone from the mouth of the well, but in verse 10 Jacob, without waiting for all the flocks, went near and rolled the stone away.<a name=569:20></a> Jacob apparently did it alone.<a name=569:21></a> I wondered if that might indicate a good lead which others might follow.<a name=569:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=569:23></a> Well, that is good.<a name=569:24></a> It has just been remarked that a spiritual person is required.<a name=569:25></a> Of course, it is not wise to enlarge on any one; it is rather wise to stress the spiritual side.<a name=569:26></a> Whether there are few or many who are engaged in the service, the spiritual should be stressed.<a name=569:27></a> And a meeting like this, of course, affords opportunity for that, whether we can join in, as it were, and roll away the stone, which would suggest anything that may be stopping the ministry.<a name=569:28></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		E.T.<a name=569:29></a>M.<a name=569:30></a> It appears that Jacob moved the stone before the fixed time according to the custom?<a name=569:31></a>

		of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the mouth of the well, and watered the sheep of Laban his mother's brother".<a name=570:1></a> That is the solution of the whole matter; that is to say, it is the idea of the relation that existed between Jacob and Rachel just as it also existed between Isaac and Rebecca.<a name=570:2></a> It is the same kind of relation.<a name=570:3></a> It is a question of the previous relationship in both types.<a name=570:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=570:5></a>M.<a name=570:6></a> It says in verse 8, "they roll the stone from the mouth of the well", as if that was a sort of methodical thing that happened all the time.<a name=570:7></a> But this move by Jacob seems to be prompted by love.<a name=570:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=570:9></a> Just so; the relationship between Jacob and Rachel and Leah on the one hand, and Isaac and Rebecca on the other, is a great point in each of these two types; especially in the case of Rebecca because Abraham calls his servant to swear to him that he will not take any wife for his son except of his own relations.<a name=570:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=570:11></a>M.<a name=570:12></a> It would seem that Jacob's move in regard to the well was, in type, because of love for the assembly.<a name=570:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=570:14></a> So that the question comes up immediately as to where we are.<a name=570:15></a> I think we can rightly assume that we are here this afternoon because of spiritual links between us, and that these links centre in the assembly.<a name=570:16></a> And, of course, that is what God is aiming at in view of the final display of the assembly.<a name=570:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=571:2></a> And the question arises as to whether the brethren are shepherding or are being shepherded.<a name=571:3></a> The spirit of shepherding comes into this whole matter, and it comes into the assembly, too.<a name=571:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=571:8></a> Quite so.<a name=571:9></a> It was mentioned, in prayer, that, "one is your instructor, and all <i>ye</i> are brethren", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#23:8">Matthew  23:8</a>.<a name=571:10></a> So that the Master in heaven is the great Shepherd of the sheep.<a name=571:11></a> It is the ministry that the Lord is carrying on now to gather His people together, and the question is whether we are being gathered, whether we are submissive to the Lord's ordering and principles.<a name=571:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.R.<a name=572:12></a> In <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>the apostle Paul says, "in the power of one Spirit <i>we</i> have all been baptised into one body".<a name=572:13></a> But then, after the relationship has been established, he suggests the idea that we drink into the one Spirit.<a name=572:14></a> In our chapter the spiritual relationship exists, but Jacob works out the idea of drinking.<a name=572:15></a>

		J.T.<a name=572:16></a> Well, just so, we are made to drink into one Spirit; that is to say, it is the divine action that effects it.<a name=572:17></a> And, of course, the action of making us drink into one Spirit enters into meetings such as we are in now, all having in mind the great matter of union.<a name=572:18></a> We should keep before us that there is such a thing as union with Christ, and it begins with the family relationship.<a name=572:19></a>

		J.T.<a name=577:16></a> Well, these are facts that come in here which we can easily follow and understand.<a name=577:17></a> Leah was hated, and God saw that she was hated; God took account of that, and therefore He gave her children and she became the fruitful mother of children; whereas Rachel was not a mother of children.<a name=577:18></a> Of course, God came in specially for her later, so that it is God in both cases.<a name=577:19></a>

		Well now, we have the thought of the lawgiver in the passage I have read from Numbers.<a name=582:3></a> The allusion is not to Judah here.<a name=582:4></a> The allusion is probably to Moses; "at the direction of the lawgiver" the well is digged.<a name=582:5></a> The well would enter into the thoughts of all the tribes.<a name=582:6></a> It alludes to the Holy Spirit and so it is that Moses is in one's mind in that sense.<a name=582:7></a> I have been alluding to Judah first because it is the question of purpose with Judah, but before he entered on his office as ruler, which would be in David peculiarly, Moses served.<a name=582:8></a> He served to write not only the book of Numbers, but all five books of the Pentateuch.<a name=582:9></a> And so we may say that he has the greatest place in ministry to the tribes of Israel.<a name=582:10></a> Of course, the Lord Jesus has the greatest place, in everything He has the pre-eminence, but I am speaking now of persons who are like ourselves, creatures who are employed in ministry, and Moses, I would say, has the greatest place.<a name=582:11></a> And here he is said to have directed the digging of the well.<a name=582:12></a> It was at the direction of the lawgiver and the word was, "Rise up, well!<a name=582:13></a> sing unto it".<a name=582:14></a> So that we are happily situated immediately in the service of God; even at a time like this we are happily situated and circumstanced so that we have the well, the power of the Spirit, to help us in that in which we are engaged.<a name=582:15></a> And so the thought of the lawgiver comes in, which is important, for, even if we have poetry or singing or hymns or psalms, the principle of the lawgiver must be seen in all.<a name=582:16></a> That is to say we must be governed aright in all our matters and especially in God's service.<a name=582:17></a> And that is why I linked on Paul with

		the persons who are lawgivers.<a name=583:1></a> The epistles, or letters, to Corinth afford above all of his other epistles material for lawgiving.<a name=583:2></a> Although I disclaimed at the outset the thought of stressing law, there is nothing more needed in the true sense and particularly in the sense of which I have spoken.<a name=583:3></a> And so it is that God ordained that Moses should be a lawgiver.<a name=583:4></a> He is at ease in writing the book of Genesis.<a name=583:5></a> No doubt many of us have been struck with the ease with which things have been left in that book.<a name=583:6></a> How little restraint, how little demand in that book.<a name=583:7></a> What liberty we see in Abraham; what dignity in his liberty!<a name=583:8></a> And yet, he is subject to his wife at some times.<a name=583:9></a> "Cast out the bondwoman and her son", says Sarah, showing that Genesis introduces all that is necessary, and especially in a wife.<a name=583:10></a> Indeed, the book of Genesis is remarkable in the sense of the provision of wives for the ministers.<a name=583:11></a> So that we have in Scripture the idea of a man finding a wife.<a name=583:12></a> He finds a good thing, it says -- not simply a good person, but a good <i>thing</i> -- the thing being a suggestion of what is usable.<a name=583:13></a> And so we have the leaders in Genesis finding wives; several from Terah's family.<a name=583:14></a> Hence the latitude that is found in Genesis.<a name=583:15></a> It is a book characterised by old men, because longevity was much greater in Genesis than in subsequent periods.<a name=583:16></a> Hence those who were in God's service were mostly old men.<a name=583:17></a> And yet, probably the most effective in God's service in the book of Genesis was peculiarly a young man -- Joseph.<a name=583:18></a> One might name him the lawgiver of his day.<a name=583:19></a> God had made him a father to Pharaoh, and this shows how young brothers may acquire fatherhood before they are that by age.<a name=583:20></a> And how great the need is for fathers, dear brethren.<a name=583:21></a> We see it in Joseph -- a young man.<a name=583:22></a> God made him a father to Pharaoh.<a name=583:23></a> We can understand with appreciation the term 'Father' as applied to Christ: "Mighty God, Father of Eternity, Prince of Peace", <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#9:6">Isaiah  9:6</a>.<a name=583:24></a> So that Genesis, whilst marked by old men in the

		service of God, has the greatest expression of service set out in a young man, and in that service he is not simply an able man who can do things, but he is a type of Christ.<a name=584:1></a> And so liberty, in a peculiar way, enters into Genesis, and it comes down to Numbers in the fact that the lawgiver directs the digging of the well -- not giving law, but directing the digging of the well!<a name=584:2></a> How much we need the well, dear brethren, and happily it is evident here today that some effect is being produced by the ministry of the Spirit.<a name=584:3></a> So that what one is saying has in mind that there should be full provision made for the Spirit, for it was by the direction of the lawgiver that the well was digged and the song was sung: "Rise up, well!<a name=584:4></a> sing unto it", <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21:17">Numbers  21:17</a>.<a name=584:5></a> The singing is unto <i>it</i>.<a name=584:6></a> We can see, therefore, the need of law in all our matters, and yet no mere code.<a name=584:7></a> There was a system of rules in Israel, but not in christianity -- no hard and fast rules for the service of God, and yet there is order.<a name=584:8></a> Even if it be the collection among the saints, a matter that has held a great place among the brethren for many years, it is worked out in liberty -- in liberty as to the circumstances of the servants or ministers, and liberty among the brethren in their needs being met.<a name=584:9></a> And so the great lawgiver says much about the collection.<a name=584:10></a> In earlier days it was a matter of how much was put into the collection rather than how much was needed.<a name=584:11></a> But the point in Scripture is what is needed: ".<a name=584:12></a>.<a name=584:13></a>.<a name=584:14></a> and see his brother having need".<a name=584:15></a> We must look into that matter and take care of it.<a name=584:16></a> But the great lawgiver says to the Corinthians in his lawgiving as to the collection: "Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I directed the assemblies of Galatia, so do <i>ye</i> do also .<a name=584:17></a>.<a name=584:18></a>.<a name=584:19></a> that there may be no collections when I come", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#16:1">1 Corinthians  16:1</a>, 2.<a name=584:20></a> That is to say, the great lawgiver will not influence the pocketbooks of the brethren.<a name=584:21></a> He will leave that to love and calculation, for the need of the brethren has to be discovered and

		And now the word in <a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#43:12">Ezekiel  43:12</a> comes to mind.<a name=586:8></a> Ezekiel was a priest; he was not a son of David, he was a priest.<a name=586:9></a> But he is in keeping with Moses as to the law of the house.<a name=586:10></a> I will read it from the New Translation: "This is the law of the house: Upon the top of the mountain all its border round about is most holy.<a name=586:11></a> Behold, this is the law of the house".<a name=586:12></a> So that we are not left to ourselves as to the house of God.<a name=586:13></a> I was speaking of the collection but other things are also in mind.<a name=586:14></a> It is not as if things are optional in the house of God and that we are found looking round for better situations or better spiritual circumstances.<a name=586:15></a> They are not in any hands but God's hands.<a name=586:16></a> Christ is over the house of God and the law of the house is determined by Him.<a name=586:17></a> The principles governing the house and the ministry and all related to it are regulated and governed by Him.<a name=586:18></a> So that He that has built the house has more honour than the house.<a name=586:19></a> Therefore again we have the greatness of Christ.<a name=586:20></a> He is greater than the house, and He must determine where we are to be and the principles that govern us, and if we elect to leave right principles and go elsewhere on account of other things, we are at issue with Christ.<a name=586:21></a> We are at issue with the great Regulator of the law of God, the Lawgiver.<a name=586:22></a> Whether it be the house of Judah or the house of Levi, Moses or David, the lawgiver is in authority and he must determine matters.<a name=586:23></a> For any to be just rovers going where they think they should, because they are dissatisfied with what they have, will not do; the Lawgiver will have to say

		to that.<a name=587:1></a> The Lord Jesus has to say to that; He is over the house and all the principles entering into it.<a name=587:2></a> It is remarkable how much Paul, who is our apostle under Christ, has to say about principles -- he is the great lawgiver of the New Testament under Christ.<a name=587:3></a> He has come before the brethren very much of late, and I believe to their immense profit.<a name=587:4></a> He fits in at the right time under the regulations of the great Head in heaven.<a name=587:5></a> The Lord appeared to him at a given time and at a given place.<a name=587:6></a> He selected the place and the moment and the man.<a name=587:7></a> He said, "he is a chosen vessel unto me".<a name=587:8></a> The Lord would imply that Paul was to have authority.<a name=587:9></a> We know well enough how religious leaders in this world slight Paul and his ministry.<a name=587:10></a> They did it at Corinth, too: "his presence in the body weak, and his speech naught".<a name=587:11></a> And such things are said today, too.<a name=587:12></a> But Paul was, in effect, the great lawgiver of christianity.<a name=587:13></a> I say in effect because, under Christ, that is what he is.<a name=587:14></a> He uses such language as: "if any one think to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor the assemblies of God", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:16">1 Corinthians  11:16</a>.<a name=587:15></a> So we are to pay attention to Paul and be regulated in everything.<a name=587:16></a> It is remarkable how he comes down to the circumstances of men, women and children, so that all should be right in view of the assembly, for it is the great thought of God which was given to Paul -- the mystery as he calls it.<a name=587:17></a> "The mystery has been made known to me", he says, in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:3">Ephesians  3:3</a>.<a name=587:18></a> So that everything is in his hands in that sense.<a name=587:19></a> Some may say that everything is in Peter's hands, but it is not so.<a name=587:20></a> Not one of the apostles has such a place as Paul; not even Peter, who was given the administration of the kingdom.<a name=587:21></a> But Paul has the administration of the assembly, of the mystery.<a name=587:22></a> So that we do well to pay careful attention to what is said by Paul.<a name=587:23></a> One has said many times of late, quoting a great servant who has brought the truth to us, that we are not to forget John, but cleave to Paul.<a name=587:24></a> It is for each one of us to understand how we are to cleave

		Well, I have said much about other things, but very little about holiness, but the word in Ezekiel is, "This is the law of the house: Upon the top of the mountain all its border round about is most holy".<a name=588:9></a> That must be something different from Jerusalem.<a name=588:10></a> Ezekiel has something else in his mind as to the law of the house.<a name=588:11></a> The point is holiness.<a name=588:12></a> The law of the house is mentioned twice in the passage.<a name=588:13></a> It is a question of holiness: "Be ye holy, for <i>I</i> am holy".<a name=588:14></a> It is the prime thought of heaven brought down to us in ministry -- especially Paul's ministry -- so that we should know how to serve God in holiness.<a name=588:15></a> And so Paul says, "<i>we</i> are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God, and boast in Christ Jesus, and do not trust in flesh", <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3:3">Philippians  3:3</a>.<a name=588:16></a> That is the idea.<a name=588:17></a> It is where the holiness of God is, "Be ye holy, for <i>I</i> am holy".<a name=588:18></a> God will not brook unholiness.<a name=588:19></a> Indeed, our children are said to be holy because they are born of christian parents.<a name=588:20></a> They are to be kept under hand for God and for Christ and for the assembly.<a name=588:21></a> We are to bring up our children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.<a name=588:22></a> It is in view of holiness, that they may know how to be in the house of God and belong to it.<a name=588:23></a> And so Paul under Christ is

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=604:1></a> Our subject at this time treats of Joseph and Asnath his wife.<a name=604:2></a> The brethren will be aware that nothing special is stated as to Asnath.<a name=604:3></a> In each of the types that we have considered before, such as Eve, Rebecca, Leah and Rachel, there have been elements of virtue which have been recorded.<a name=604:4></a> In this case, what we may speak of as virtue is almost entirely seen in Joseph.<a name=604:5></a> He is outstanding in the family of Abraham -- outstanding in the whole book, really, as a type of Christ, and as viewing him thus, it becomes a matter of the facts relating to Joseph's history, especially in that part in which he typifies Christ as raised up on high.<a name=604:6></a> Indeed, in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:33">Acts  2:33</a> we have the word: "Having therefore been exalted by the right hand of God .<a name=604:7></a>.<a name=604:8></a>.<a name=604:9></a>" So that we are to view Asnath as typifying the assembly from that standpoint, and how she runs through to the end of the dispensations -- not simply the present dispensation, but all dispensations -- because the assembly is seen as a family coming down from God out of heaven, in the book of Revelation.<a name=604:10></a> And, of course, from that standpoint, we cannot view her as either Jew or gentile.<a name=604:11></a> It is a question of our heavenly relations with Christ and all that is suitable to Him.<a name=604:12></a> So that it is said at the end of the Bible, "The Spirit and the bride say, Come".<a name=604:13></a> They say, Come, to Christ.<a name=604:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		P.L.<a name=604:15></a> Do we get this order in <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2">Philippians  2</a>where we have His exaltation, renown, and authority?<a name=604:16></a> It says, "Wherefore also God highly exalted him, and granted him a name, that which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow", verses 9, 10.<a name=604:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=604:18></a> Quite so; Joseph has the name of Zaphnath-paaneah, meaning 'Saviour of the world', or 'Sustainer of life'.<a name=604:19></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=605:11></a> Quite so; and then in Ephesians, I would say, there is a combination of Jew and Gentile; nevertheless, the full thought is in it; that is to say, "<i>I</i> speak as to Christ, and as to the assembly", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:32">Ephesians  5:32</a>.<a name=605:12></a> It is not the assembly linked up with either the Jews or the gentiles, but <i>Christ</i> and <i>the assembly</i>.<a name=605:13></a> "<i>I</i> speak", he says, "as to Christ, and as to the assembly", and that, of course, comes down to our own times.<a name=605:14></a> So that what we are speaking of relates to ourselves as forming part of the assembly.<a name=605:15></a>

		J.T.<a name=605:20></a> I think so.<a name=605:21></a> The future dispensation would imply His exaltation, too.<a name=605:22></a> The Jewish remnant will come into that, of course.<a name=605:23></a> We considered Rachel and Leah at our last meeting.<a name=605:24></a> Rachel really refers to the Jewish remnant at the millennial end.<a name=605:25></a> Leah would link on with what we are engaged with now; that is to say, Asnath would be a gentile, but she is linked up with Joseph.<a name=605:26></a> And Leah was first received as Jacob's wife, Jacob being a type of Christ there.<a name=605:27></a> Here it is Joseph.<a name=605:28></a> Leah was the first received, and Rachel, though loved first, was received last.<a name=605:29></a> But the word said of her and of Joseph

		Well now, I desire to begin with <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>and to show how the idea of the assembly was there in the mind of God in that day of freshness.<a name=639:5></a> The verses I have read tell us plainly the facts.<a name=639:6></a> "And God created Man in his image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.<a name=639:7></a> And God blessed them; and God said to them, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heavens, and over every animal that moveth on the earth", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:27">Genesis  1:27</a>, 28.<a name=639:8></a> We can see the Spirit of God in writing these verses through Moses had in mind something that had not yet been disclosed.<a name=639:9></a> Indeed it is said formally that throughout all ages it was concealed in God, but it was there.<a name=639:10></a> The idea was there.<a name=639:11></a> And so the Spirit of God has in mind the male and female.<a name=639:12></a> There is no suggestion of inferiority of the one to the other.<a name=639:13></a> The facts show that the man was head of the woman; he is that, as Christ is Head of the assembly.<a name=639:14></a> These things are shown in the facts, but, nevertheless, it says in Verse 28, "And God blessed them; and God said to them, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion".<a name=639:15></a>

		J.T.<a name=667:1></a> It is in mind to link on our subject with the historical books.<a name=667:2></a> Chronicles has a great place, historically, beginning, as the brethren will know, with the name Adam and running on directly to the reign of David, which is introduced in the third chapter.<a name=667:3></a> The fact that the book begins with Adam would show that David had been in the mind of the Spirit from the beginning.<a name=667:4></a> The reign of David and the services that he inaugurated have a dominating place, you might say, in the Old Testament.<a name=667:5></a> And so this book begins with Adam, as mentioned in chapter 5 of Genesis, and runs on through Seth and Enoch, down through Noah, through Abraham and then, finally, down to David.<a name=667:6></a> If we are to read the Scriptures aright, having them before us in connection with the service of God, we need the book of Chronicles, for it leads us on to David who inaugurated the twenty-four courses of priests; and this is linked on, in the book of Revelation, with the twenty-four elders.<a name=667:7></a> So that the introduction of David in this way is of great importance in connection with the service of God, which begins, properly, with the Lord's supper.<a name=667:8></a> It is thought that these remarks should facilitate, or help us at this time in connection with our references to books of Joshua and Chronicles.<a name=667:9></a> The position of Achsah is of great interest in the types, because it is so surrounded with spiritual thoughts, suggested in Caleb and Joshua, for instance.<a name=667:10></a> The passage read from the book of Judges is almost identical with the same narrative in the book of Joshua.<a name=667:11></a> It says, "And Caleb said, He that smites Kirjath-sepher and takes it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter as wife.<a name=667:12></a> And Othniel the son of Kenaz.<a name=667:13></a> Caleb's younger brother, took it; and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife",

		J.T.<a name=689:1></a> It is in mind to look at Ruth as a type of the assembly, but it may be well to first clarify certain points which, I think, should be mentioned.<a name=689:2></a> First, I would say that she is viewed as a person who has love for the one who, for the moment, is the vessel of testimony.<a name=689:3></a> Naomi represents the people of God.<a name=689:4></a> Whatever may be said about her going to Moab, she is seen here as returning to the position of the people of God, and being honoured as coming back to that position.<a name=689:5></a> Chapter 1 shows that whilst Ruth's sister-in-law, Orpah, went back.<a name=689:6></a> Ruth clave to Naomi, clearly viewing her as lovable.<a name=689:7></a> And according to all the facts that come out as to Naomi, she had a clear understanding of the people of God, knowing what belonged to them, what was suitable to them, and what was seemly in them.<a name=689:8></a> Ruth valued all that, and in her committal said, among other things, that where Naomi died she would die and be buried there.<a name=689:9></a> She committed herself wholly to Naomi, and I believe in that sense she becomes a type of the assembly, that is to say, of the saints who love those who are of the testimony, regarding them in their seemliness.<a name=689:10></a> In result, as moving on those lines she became the wife of Boaz, a near relative of Elimelech, who had the right of redemption, and therefore is a type of Christ; Ruth herself, as has been remarked, being a type of the assembly.<a name=689:11></a> It is for us to ponder these things to see if Scripture bears out what is being said.<a name=689:12></a>

		J.T.<a name=690:6></a> It does.<a name=690:7></a> Boaz is a type of Christ, the One who has the right to redeem.<a name=690:8></a> And then there is the idea of raising up the name of the dead; that is another point which comes out in this book.<a name=690:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.N.<a name=690:10></a>W.<a name=690:11></a> A further idea is that of purchase; the word <i>purchase</i> is a potent one, it seems to me, pointing in the direction you are suggesting: "the assembly of God, which he has purchased with the blood of his own", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20:28">Acts  20:28</a>.<a name=690:12></a> Boaz says, in chapter 4: 10, "Ruth .<a name=690:13></a>.<a name=690:14></a>.<a name=690:15></a> have I purchased to be my wife".<a name=690:16></a>

		W.A.<a name=690:23></a>T.<a name=690:24></a> The name of Ruth is mentioned in the genealogy in Matthew, which is the assembly gospel.<a name=690:25></a> Would that not indicate the link that she has with the assembly?<a name=690:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=690:27></a> The facts that establish what we are looking into are found in this very book; that is to say, Ruth was one who loved Naomi.<a name=690:28></a> That is asserted; not only that she clave to Naomi, but in the last chapter she is said to have loved her, verse 15.<a name=690:29></a>

		J.A.<a name=690:30></a>P.<a name=690:31></a> Is there any type of the Holy Spirit in this book?<a name=690:32></a> The Holy Spirit has come into several of our other inquiries as to the assembly; particularly in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24">Genesis  24</a>, and elsewhere, and I was wondering if that is so in this book.<a name=690:33></a> I cannot see that it is, but I was wondering if it is so.<a name=690:34></a>

		J.T.<a name=691:3></a> Well, that is the one thing that was on my mind.<a name=691:4></a> There may be a reference there.<a name=691:5></a> In certain instances, when you get distinguished unnamed persons, the likelihood is that there is an allusion to the Spirit, and I would fully go with the thought that the servant here would be such a type.<a name=691:6></a> He is a nameless servant, but a man of distinction, a man of business, a man of action, in that sense.<a name=691:7></a> He was particularly in my mind, but one does not like to say too much, because there is so much that points to the Spirit, and we do not need to force anything.<a name=691:8></a> But I would quite go with the suggestion that the servant of Boaz may be an allusion to the Spirit.<a name=691:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=691:15></a> Well, as I was remarking, it is well to be a little restrained as to this; there is so much that can be said on that point that we do not need to force anything; the Lord is assuring us and comforting us as to it, especially as to such persons as 'the master of the house', in the gospels.<a name=691:16></a> These illustrations are quite sufficient to bring out the truth of the Holy Spirit, so that we do not need to force anything.<a name=691:17></a>

		J.T.<a name=691:18></a>Jr.<a name=691:19></a> The servant's accurate knowledge of what Ruth did would show that he would be a very forceful type.<a name=691:20></a> It says, "And she came, and has continued from the morning until now: her sitting in the house has been little as yet", chapter 2: 7.<a name=691:21></a> He had accurate knowledge of Ruth's movements.<a name=691:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=692:4></a>M.<a name=692:5></a> You were stressing the thought of love; that seems to be her only link, would you not say, inasmuch as her setting was really reproachful?<a name=692:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=692:7></a> Yes; love overcomes it, everything she does is seemly.<a name=692:8></a> And all that Boaz does is seemly, too, so that the enemy is shut out.<a name=692:9></a> Take, for example, Boaz's suggestions to her to remain till the morning, and then to let it not be known that a woman was in the threshing floor; all was seemly, it was according to what is right, which is a great matter in these things.<a name=692:10></a> It is a question of seemliness, and, of course, it ultimately brings us to what came out in Christ, because it must be so when we deal with a matter fully.<a name=692:11></a> We must see the thing working out in Christ in the gospels.<a name=692:12></a> And the book of Ruth can be seen worked out in the gospels.<a name=692:13></a> Of that I am certain.<a name=692:14></a> And this would show the importance of studying the Scriptures.<a name=692:15></a> The apostle says, "Think of what I say, for the Lord will give thee understanding in all things", <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:7">2 Timothy  2:7</a>.<a name=692:16></a> And what we need in these meetings is to get understanding from the Lord, but the ministry is the basis of it: "Think of what I say".<a name=692:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=692:18></a>M.<a name=692:19></a> That allusion to the life of the Lord is a very beautiful suggestion, because the assembly must derive every feature of beauty and all else from Christ.<a name=692:20></a>

		J.T.<a name=713:1></a> It may be a help, generally, to mention that in connection with Abigail, a type of the assembly, we have the prophetic word; the prophetic word enters into this section of Scripture in a peculiar measure and especially in Samuel, of whom it is said in the book of Acts that the prophetic word began with him.<a name=713:2></a> As a matter of fact Samuel's mother, Hannah, had a certain prophetic touch as can be seen in her prayer in chapter 2 of this book.<a name=713:3></a> Samuel himself is pre-eminently typical of the prophetic word, and David, too, comes into it.<a name=713:4></a> It may help to keep all this in mind because the prophetic word has been much before us for many years and it is still before us.<a name=713:5></a> And it is undoubtedly intended to amplify the thought of the assembly, as the leading family of God, of which it is said: "to him be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:21">Ephesians  3:21</a>.<a name=713:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=714:9></a> Well, the book largely deals with David, but Samuel gives character to it.<a name=714:10></a> We are dealing with Abigail who is a type of the assembly, and she comes in after the death of Samuel.<a name=714:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=714:16></a> Yes; I think that is good.<a name=714:17></a> Some years back allusion was made to the section of this book which treats of the hill of God, and it was thought the hill of God is marked by the prophetic word.<a name=714:18></a>

		A.R.<a name=714:19></a> It is said of Abigail that she was of good understanding, as if she had profited by the prophetic word.<a name=714:20></a>

		J.T.<a name=714:21></a> She is clearly a type of the assembly, as the bride of Christ.<a name=714:22></a> Everything that appertained to her pointed to this.<a name=714:23></a> She was a woman of good understanding and of a beautiful countenance, and grace and wisdom marked her; these features enter into the thought of the assembly.<a name=714:24></a> And, of course, if we speak of the assembly, we are to look to ourselves and see what part we have in it.<a name=714:25></a> It is not simply that we attend meetings, but that we are characterised by the features that are seen in Abigail.<a name=714:26></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=715:22></a> Well, it is remarkable and requires attention although it is negative, but we should understand what Nabal represents.<a name=715:23></a>

		A.N.<a name=715:24></a>W.<a name=715:25></a> Is not prophetic ministry to be generally on positive lines?<a name=715:26></a> That chapter in Corinthians speaks of encouragement, consolation, and edification.<a name=715:27></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=716:8></a> He belonged to the family of Caleb.<a name=716:9></a> That, in itself, should have meant something, but apparently it did not mean much in his case, for he was not at all like Caleb, although a descendant of his.<a name=716:10></a> So that we cannot go by what people have been, it is what they are today.<a name=716:11></a> The test is what we are now.<a name=716:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=716:15></a> I should certainly say so.<a name=716:16></a> Therefore, the epistle to the Ephesians stresses the responsibility of the fathers to bring up their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.<a name=716:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=716:23></a> Yes; the young man referred to here is notable.<a name=716:24></a> It is said: "And one of Nabal's young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to bless our master; and he has insulted them.<a name=716:25></a> And the men were very good to us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we anything, as long as we companied with them, when we were in the fields.<a name=716:26></a> They were a wall to us both by night and day, all the while we were with them feeding the sheep", verses 14 - 16.<a name=716:27></a> Now it seems to be of note that this young man's name is not given, so that he would be

		J.T.<a name=743:13></a> Well, it does fit in, it is a question of how Scripture uses that great thought; so the Father is bringing many sons to glory; that is masculine.<a name=743:14></a>

		E.E.<a name=743:15></a>H.<a name=743:16></a> When we consider ourselves in relation to the Father the thought of sonship is prominent, and when we consider ourselves in relation to Christ as His bride or wife the relation is feminine, is that the idea?<a name=743:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=743:18></a> That is the idea exactly.<a name=743:19></a> It is just a question of scriptural usage, which, of course, we are safe in following.<a name=743:20></a> We want to be with God and He is using certain words, and certain ways of speaking and we should follow them.<a name=743:21></a>
