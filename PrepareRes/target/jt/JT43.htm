		J.T.<a name=1:1></a> The idea of dwelling, divine dwelling on earth, is one of the leading subjects of the Scriptures and it seems to me that we might consider, for the three readings ahead of us, if the Lord permit, the conditions of divine dwelling such as God can accept.<a name=1:2></a> We get the thought of dwelling first in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#28">Genesis  28</a>, in connection with Jacob.<a name=1:3></a> It was named by one who was in it, that is, Jacob.<a name=1:4></a> He realised the presence of God and called the place "the house of God", and David later alludes to Jacob in that connection.<a name=1:5></a> He represents our side of the subject, that is, the side which attaches to every Christian, everyone who loves God, and who desires to have, as far as he may, conditions for God to be near him, and abide with him.<a name=1:6></a> So David asked Jehovah to remember his afflictions, how he was afflicted in regard to the matter.<a name=1:7></a> He suffered the loss of his sleep, as he says, so that he might find a place for the Lord -- a habitation for the mighty God of Jacob, Exodus is the proper book to get help from in looking into the subject.<a name=1:8></a> We have, indeed, in the exit from Egypt an allusion to it.<a name=1:9></a> As the people came out of Egypt, they spoke of it; they said "This is my God, and I will glorify him",(<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15:2">Exodus  15:2</a>) and it appears that the word denotes that they would make Him a dwelling.<a name=1:10></a> I suppose in no way do we glorify Him more than in making Him a dwelling, a place where He can be at home here on earth where Christ has been rejected.<a name=1:11></a> They said that He was their God, and that they would glorify Him.<a name=1:12></a> We have it on good authority that the word signified that they would make Him a dwelling and the Lord takes the thought up.<a name=1:13></a> The song of Moses, as it is called, goes on to say at the end of it that Jehovah would bring His people unto the mountain of His inheritance, the place which He had made for Himself

		to dwell in, the Sanctuary which His hands had established.<a name=2:1></a> So that the idea laid hold of the people immediately on coming out of Egypt -- whether it would be what they would do for Him, or what He would do for Himself.<a name=2:2></a> It is a question of what we do for Him, and what He does for Himself, or both.<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so in this first passage, we have the initial idea in the mind of God as to it.<a name=2:4></a> He prescribes that we are not to have gods of silver or gold beside Him.<a name=2:5></a> We know how, later on, they did this very thing, they made a golden calf beside Jehovah, formally retaining Him, but at the same time bringing in another god, a rival god, which is very common; not the refusal of God, but bringing in a rival.<a name=2:6></a> The next thing is as to the altar.<a name=2:7></a> What will help us in regard to this matter is an altar -- the kind of altar that we make to Him; an altar of earth first, and then an altar of stone.<a name=2:8></a> The brethren can link on with it.<a name=2:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.M.<a name=2:10></a> God could not dwell in a place unsuitable to Him.<a name=2:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:12></a> That is the thought.<a name=2:13></a> He commences this chapter by calling attention to the fact that there are thousands of those who love Him.<a name=2:14></a> God will have us near to Him, but why do not we seek to have God near to us, to afford Him conditions to be near us?<a name=2:15></a> How could we better express love than in this?<a name=2:16></a> If we have Him near to us, there must be conditions for Him.<a name=2:17></a> One thing I think we can readily understand is that God abominates a rival -- another god beside Him.<a name=2:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.W.<a name=2:19></a> Do you connect the thought of the altar with the thought of what we provide for God in the way of conditions?<a name=2:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:21></a> That is what I thought.<a name=2:22></a> The first is positive.<a name=2:23></a> They were not to make gods of gold or silver, but "an altar of earth shalt thou make unto me".<a name=2:24></a> Unto me -- the allusion is to Christ as Man.<a name=2:25></a> An altar of earth alludes to Christ as Man, that is, according to what He was here; an altar of stone would allude to Him as in resurrection.<a name=2:26></a>

		W.J.<a name=3:1></a>Y.<a name=3:2></a> Is the thought of an idol a false conception of God?<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:4></a> Yes.<a name=3:5></a> Why should a believer have any conception of God other than the one he began with?<a name=3:6></a> The gospel is the gospel of God concerning His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=3:7></a> It presents God to us, the Saviour God, and the acceptance of the gospel involves reception.<a name=3:8></a> Why should that ever be altered?<a name=3:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.W.<a name=3:10></a> Is that connected with the altar of earth?<a name=3:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:12></a> That is the thought.<a name=3:13></a> Jesus, as here as a Man, held to that infinitely -- what God was; what God was, not only as presented in His attributes, but what God was to Him.<a name=3:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.W.<a name=3:15></a> So the apostle John, before bringing in the warning about idols, says, "This is the true God, and eternal life",(<a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:20">1 John  5:20</a>).<a name=3:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:17></a> The Lord Himself said, "That they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent", (<a href="../bible/John.htm#17:3">John  17:3</a>).<a name=3:18></a> It is not only what is presented to us as profitable to us, but the conception of God that Jesus had -- that is a perfect idea of God, and ultimately that is what all are to be brought to.<a name=3:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.E.<a name=3:20></a> In regard to the altar of earth, would this be one of the first movements of a soul in a positive way?<a name=3:21></a> Would there be certain instincts in a soul at the beginning that would appreciate Christ as Man?<a name=3:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:23></a> That is the thought.<a name=3:24></a> God has brought in Christ.<a name=3:25></a> He was here for thirty years under His eye and then God announces His delight in Him.<a name=3:26></a> He was praying as the Spirit came upon Him and the voice came from heaven.<a name=3:27></a> He had an infinitely accurate conception of God.<a name=3:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.J.<a name=3:29></a>Y.<a name=3:30></a> Is the making of an altar appreciation of Christ, just as the making of an idol would be lack of appreciation of Christ?<a name=3:31></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:32></a> That is the thought, I think.<a name=3:33></a> The making of an idol would be want of appreciation of God, the divine thought of God.<a name=3:34></a> The making of an altar would

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=4:6></a> Why is it that we have the altar brought in before the building, before the dwelling place?<a name=4:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:8></a> There can be no thought of providing for God aside from sacrifice.<a name=4:9></a> There must be sacrifice.<a name=4:10></a> God intimates at once that that is the line.<a name=4:11></a> It is a question of sacrifice.<a name=4:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:15></a> That is imperative.<a name=4:16></a> "If thou wilt make me an altar of stone", that would be a question of your spiritual ability, but the altar of earth gives us a status.<a name=4:17></a> The altar of stone is progress.<a name=4:18></a> But verse 24 says, "An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me"; that is imperative.<a name=4:19></a> We must have that, or we are not Christians at all.<a name=4:20></a> There is no Christianity without sacrifice, either on God's part or ours.<a name=4:21></a> We must begin with sacrifice -- that is the first thing mentioned, the first positive thing.<a name=4:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.F.<a name=4:23></a> Unless we know something of sacrifice, there can be no thought of God dwelling with us.<a name=4:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:25></a> That is one of the initial thoughts.<a name=4:26></a> An altar of earth is the idea of Christ as Man, that is, as a Man here, as He is seen in the gospels.<a name=4:27></a> That is, God is intimating here that these are the lines He is on.<a name=4:28></a> Christ was coming in, and it is for us to get on to that line.<a name=4:29></a> It would be a question of a building or house or dwelling for Him.<a name=4:30></a> That is what is on the Lord's heart -- to find a place for God, so He reaches it first in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>.<a name=4:31></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16">Psalm  16</a>, He abominates the idea of idolatry -- He speaks of what those who sought out another god should suffer.<a name=4:32></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>He says, "In the midst of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.F.<a name=5:12></a> Were you distinguishing between the altar and the burnt offerings and the peace offerings?<a name=5:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:14></a> What we have already said refers mainly to the altar.<a name=5:15></a> We have to get the idea of the altar, it is what Christ is.<a name=5:16></a> That is, it is a question of suffering, of bearing suffering, but suffering towards God.<a name=5:17></a> The Lord was the altar and the sacrifice as well, and the priest also.<a name=5:18></a> He was all.<a name=5:19></a> He was the altar and the offering and the priest at one time -- a great combination of great moral elements.<a name=5:20></a> That is what is meant here, that we should get on to that line.<a name=5:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.E.<a name=5:22></a> So that as God approaches men He finds all He wants in Christ, and as we approach God we find all in Christ too.<a name=5:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:24></a> As we get on to that line God announces to the universe that "this is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#3:17">Matthew  3:17</a>.<a name=5:25></a> And we are to get on to that line, the line that God is on.<a name=5:26></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		E.G.<a name=6:5></a> Why is it "thou shalt make"?<a name=6:6></a> Just now it was "ye".<a name=6:7></a> Why is it in the singular?<a name=6:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:9></a> The singular is used in addressing a collective number, the whole number.<a name=6:10></a> They are all included in the "thou".<a name=6:11></a> All Israel was included in it.<a name=6:12></a> It is a common way throughout the types.<a name=6:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=6:16></a> Quite so.<a name=6:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.D.<a name=6:18></a> The words 'ye have seen' are used at the beginning of the previous chapter, "Ye have seen what I have done to the Egyptians" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#19:4">Exodus  19:4</a>), and in this chapter (verse 22), "Ye have seen that I have spoken with you from the heavens".<a name=6:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:20></a> That is the idea.<a name=6:21></a> What a privilege to be spoken to out of the heavens!<a name=6:22></a> We have the thought amplified in chapter 24, because the idea of dwelling must necessarily be linked up with the heavens.<a name=6:23></a> Heaven is God's dwelling place.<a name=6:24></a> Chapter 24 shows that they went up and saw the God of Israel, and what was under His feet.<a name=6:25></a> They saw His living conditions.<a name=6:26></a> Jacob alluded to this; the first mention of the house is that it is the gate of heaven.<a name=6:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.D.<a name=6:28></a> I was thinking of the words 'I have spoken' in connection with the hymn we sang just now.<a name=6:29></a> It is the response to that voice.<a name=6:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:31></a> It is not only what the voice says, but where it comes from.<a name=6:32></a> The heavens were opened to Christ, as much as to say 'You have a place up here', and He knew the conditions in heaven.<a name=6:33></a> Indeed, He says He is the Son of Man which is in heaven.<a name=6:34></a> The dwelling on earth must be a transcript of what is in heaven.<a name=6:35></a> The idea is, what is in heaven.<a name=6:36></a>

		J.T.<a name=7:4></a> The thought here is, "Ye have seen that I have spoken with you from the heavens" -- a holy conversation with them from the heavens.<a name=7:5></a> Hebrews opens up that He speaks from heaven now.<a name=7:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.E.<a name=7:7></a> Is that not an important consideration, that if God is going to dwell as He dwells now in the heavens and in Christ, the dwelling must be heavenly in its character?<a name=7:8></a> Is that not lost sight of today?<a name=7:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:10></a> Entirely.<a name=7:11></a> They have no idea of what is called the house of God, no idea of its being a transcript of what is in heaven.<a name=7:12></a> If conditions are not equal to what they are in heaven, then God is sacrificing to be with us, but there must be some relation to what is in heaven.<a name=7:13></a> We are told that the tabernacle is a figurative representation of what is in the heavens.<a name=7:14></a>

		J.T.<a name=7:23></a> Because the Lord makes allowance for spirituality.<a name=7:24></a> He does not unchristianise us because we are not spiritual.<a name=7:25></a> The Corinthians were not spiritual, but they were not unchristianised because of that.<a name=7:26></a> They are still regarded as the assembly of God in Corinth.<a name=7:27></a> So long as the Spirit has a place amongst the saints, they are owned of God as in some sense having conditions for Him, but then allowance is made for spirituality.<a name=7:28></a> If you can go that far, God appreciates it all the more.<a name=7:29></a> What is your own idea?<a name=7:30></a>

		J.T.<a name=18:1></a> It will be borne in mind that our subject is tabernacle or wilderness conditions for the divine dwelling.<a name=18:2></a> We left off yesterday at chapters 24 and 25: It was intimated that we should proceed with the consideration of the new covenant as bearing on this subject.<a name=18:3></a> Chapter 3 of 2 Corinthians alludes not to chapter 24 of Exodus but to chapter 34, to the second giving of the law.<a name=18:4></a> Moses was called up again to the mount and a most interesting conversation proceeded between Jehovah and him; he had acquired great moral power in the interval between chapters 24 and 34.<a name=18:5></a> The golden calf had been made, and Moses shines not only as the mediator but as offering himself, offering to sacrifice himself for Israel, and through his intercession Jehovah went on with the people, but on the ground of separation.<a name=18:6></a> The tabernacle was taken outside the camp and pitched afar off, and Moses ascends to the mount, as having thus acquired great power and acceptability to Jehovah.<a name=18:7></a> So he stands out in chapter 34 as more definitely a figure of Christ, typical of Christ.<a name=18:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		That is what is before us to begin with, so that we might understand the richness there is when we are together in assembly, that is, not yet viewed as in the land.<a name=19:3></a> We are not speaking of divine dwelling as seen in the land -- that is not our subject.<a name=19:4></a> Our subject is the conditions of divine dwelling in a scene of contrariety as seen in Exodus and, indeed, in the Pentateuch as a whole.<a name=19:5></a> So that as we link all that up with the verses read in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#35">Exodus  35</a>we can see in the type what richness existed amongst the people.<a name=19:6></a> In Exodus it is not the leading ones particularly, the kings and the princes as in the days of David and Solomon, but every man and woman in Israel.<a name=19:7></a> Exodus brings out the mutual, yet rich, conditions amongst us; but the riches are disbursed, fully disbursed and equally divided, not all centred in the kings and princes as in Chronicles.<a name=19:8></a> And what is particularly worth noticing in a practical way is the allusion to the sabbath in the opening verses.<a name=19:9></a> It is said, "And Moses collected all the assembly of the children of Israel, and said to them.<a name=19:10></a> These are the things which Jehovah has commanded, to do them.<a name=19:11></a> Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you a holy day, a sabbath of rest to Jehovah: whoever does work on it shall be put to death.<a name=19:12></a> Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your dwellings upon the sabbath day".<a name=19:13></a> That reminds us of the need of apprehending Christ as the sabbath, and shows how we are to be restful in the enjoyment of the riches that the covenant suggests, so that we are balanced in our part in the assembly.<a name=19:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=22:3></a> It is to call attention to the presence of Christ here -- that God found His rest there.<a name=22:4></a> The manna stands related to the sabbath, it is the first mention we have of it formally.<a name=22:5></a> The relation between the sabbath and the manna is significant because it is Christ, as we read in the hymn, "once humbled here", it is the Lord Jesus here as man in ordinary circumstances.<a name=22:6></a> That is to say, <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:7">Philippians  2:7</a> says He "emptied himself, taking a bondman's form, taking his place in the likeness of men", outwardly an ordinary man, sin apart, as you would see in Palestine at that time in everyday circumstances.<a name=22:7></a> Whatever men may have thought of Him, God says 'I have found my delight in Him'.<a name=22:8></a> God rests in that.<a name=22:9></a>

		J.T.<a name=22:12></a> They synchronise, but the sabbath is carried forward.<a name=22:13></a> After the first forty days on the mount Jehovah refers to the sabbath again.<a name=22:14></a> In the closing verses of chapter 31 you find a great deal said about the sabbath and something said about it that is not said anywhere else, that God rested on it and was refreshed, meaning that He had been unfolding the glories of Christ to Moses during the forty days.<a name=22:15></a> God had a great time of it, speaking reverently, a much better time than Moses had.<a name=22:16></a> He was unfolding Christ to him and at the end of the giving of instructions about the tabernacle He refers to the sabbath and enjoins it in the strongest terms, saying that He rested on that day and was refreshed.<a name=22:17></a> That is what He had on the sabbath, and I think this chapter begins with this thought in the same sense, that God would bring us into the spirit of restfulness, for we are apt to be very active, even in the assembly.<a name=22:18></a>

		J.T.<a name=31:1></a> Our subject began with <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#20">Exodus  20</a>and we went on to the covenant and the material for the dwelling.<a name=31:2></a> What is in mind tonight is just a continuation of that, the covenant being before us.<a name=31:3></a> The link with chapter 3 is maintained in these chapters, but the minister, as representative of Christ, is strongly prominent throughout as one (that is the apostle Paul) fitted of God to make divine thoughts intelligible and effective.<a name=31:4></a> So that we have here in chapter 6 a list of some thirty-seven items characterising Paul and leading up to the verses read, in which he indicates that his heart is expanded towards the saints, towards the Corinthians; this is all borne out in detail in the type, that is, in Moses.<a name=31:5></a> God directs that he, Aaron, Nadab and Abihu and seventy of the elders should go up, and says no more.<a name=31:6></a> Moses immediately, in true mediatorship, brings the words of the Lord, Jehovah, to the people and tells them all that He said, as if he had in mind that in going up they must go up suitably in reconciliation, and to that end in the fulness of the covenant and in the fulness and understanding of what is implied in the whole position, that is, the unity of the tribes.<a name=31:7></a> And so he rehearses the words of Jehovah and the people say, "All the words that Jehovah has said will we do!<a name=31:8></a>" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#24:3">Exodus  24:3</a>) Then Moses builds the twelve pillars and the altar, and the youths are employed as priests, the blood is put into the basons and he sprinkles the blood on the altar and the people and the book, and says, using the word covenant, "Behold the blood of the covenant that Jehovah has made with you",(<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#24:8">Exodus  24:8</a>) for all the people said, "All that Jehovah has said will we do, and obey!<a name=31:9></a>" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#24:7">Exodus  24:7</a>).<a name=31:10></a> So that on the ground of this Moses and Aaron and Nadab and Abihu and seventy of the elders go up and they see

		the God of Israel and eat and drink and are called nobles, and then Jehovah says that Moses is to come up higher, and be there, meaning that the mediator is now a heavenly thought as we are fit to go up.<a name=32:1></a> The heavenly thought is established and the mediator is to be there, that is, Christ on high; as the writer to the Hebrews, commenting on it, says, "For the Christ is not entered into holy places made with hand, figures of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear before the face of God for us", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9:24">Hebrews  9:24</a>.<a name=32:2></a> So Moses was there forty days and forty nights, the idea is Christ on high, and the tables are given there, although the commandments are already spoken, and the pattern all comes out of heaven; that is the principle of divine dwelling.<a name=32:3></a>

		J.T.<a name=32:15></a> It does.<a name=32:16></a> The covenant enables you to take up that thought in liberty.<a name=32:17></a> That is why Moses, without any commandments as far as this record shows, brings in the thought of the covenant, brings in the volume of the blood and applies it to the altar and the book and the people, so that all are enveloped in the idea of love, the love of God in Christ.<a name=32:18></a> As Romans brings it out, no one can separate us from that, the love of God in Christ; we are sustained in it.<a name=32:19></a> That in itself, however, is not the heavenly position; but in the power of it we go up and are owned up there.<a name=32:20></a> The material all comes out consequent upon that, and I think we have the same order here in 2 Corinthians.<a name=32:21></a> The covenant is in

		Now that is the sum total, dear brethren, of all that this is, that the believer or believers have something in them, a latent thing that operates in fruitfulness, as the Lord says in His parable here, "The earth bringeth forth fruit of herself".<a name=82:4></a> A man sows his seed in the ground, and he rises night and day, but he does not add anything to the growth; it is God that adds to the growth; it is latent power in the earth that causes growth of the seed -- "The earth bringeth forth fruit of herself" the Lord says, first the blade, and then the ear, then the full corn in the ear.<a name=82:5></a> There are three stages mentioned before the reaping; that is, the earth does that.<a name=82:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to work on these lines in what I have to say: to go back to <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>to show you that these principles are not new, that God was ordering things for us as we have them today in the creation; He ordered the waters, that were at that time enveloping the earth, to recede, and that the dry land should appear.<a name=82:7></a> That was the divine fiat, that the dry land should appear, and it did appear.<a name=82:8></a> A wonderful result for God, that the dry land that we call Australia, and Europe, and America, and Asia and the Islands of the Sea, the dry land appeared.<a name=82:9></a> What a mighty exploit of God!<a name=82:10></a> But then it came out of the waters, and had in it latent power, as I said, so that God says to it now: "Let the earth cause grass to spring up, herb producing seed, fruit-trees .<a name=82:11></a>.<a name=82:12></a>.<a name=82:13></a> the seed of which is in them, on the earth.<a name=82:14></a> And it was so".<a name=82:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, in order to make this clearer as applicable to Christians, <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>tells us that as Christ was raised from among the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also are to walk in newness of life.<a name=83:4></a> Now the subject treated in that passage is baptism, which is called the first ordinance of Christianity.<a name=83:5></a> Every believer is to be baptised.<a name=83:6></a> The Lord says to His apostles, in sending them out, "He that believeth and is baptised shall be saved", (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#116:16">Mark  116:16</a>).<a name=83:7></a> Whether he is baptise before his conversion or after, "He that believeth and is baptised shall be saved";(<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#16:16">Mark  16:16</a>) and this chapter, <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>, deals with baptism, not as a mere rite attached to Christianity, but as a figure of Christ's death, a real thought, the Lord speaking of it feelingly; He says "I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!<a name=83:8></a>" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#12:50">Luke  12:50</a>).<a name=83:9></a> That was really death for Him, a real thing, dear friends, which we should think of and speak of feelingly, that the Lord Jesus Himself entered the waters of death.<a name=83:10></a> He said, "All thy waves and thy billows are gone over me", (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#42:7">Psalm  42:7</a>).<a name=83:11></a> Deep calling unto deep, as it were.<a name=83:12></a> In His case it was the real article of death, and not only so, but the forsaking of God; He entered into death in all its reality for us.<a name=83:13></a> He never entered it on His own account.<a name=83:14></a> He was immune from death; He was the Prince or Author of life Himself, but submitted Himself to wicked hands, to be crucified and slain, and so He entered into death, and lay in the tomb three days and three nights, as He tells us Himself.<a name=83:15></a>

		But this passage in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>says that He "was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:4">Romans  6:4</a>).<a name=84:1></a> What a beautiful expression that is!<a name=84:2></a> It means that the Father, having watched over that precious body as it lay there for three days and three nights in the earth, as the time arrived He raised it by His glory, not only by His power, but by His glory; His whole affection was in it.<a name=84:3></a> So it says, "As many as have been baptised unto Christ Jesus, have been baptised unto his death";(<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:3">Romans  6:3</a>) baptised unto Christ, of course, but the full bearing of that is that you are baptised unto His death, and the passage goes on to say that "as Christ has been raised up from among the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also should walk in newness of life",(<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:4">Romans  6:4</a>).<a name=84:4></a> Now newness of life there corresponds with this passage in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>.<a name=84:5></a> It is as if we were coming out of the waters of death.<a name=84:6></a> We have come out with Christ, buried in baptism, and also risen with Him through faith of the operation of God, as Colossians teaches.<a name=84:7></a> The epistle to the Romans does not go that far, but it does say, "Walk in newness of life",(<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:4">Romans  6:4</a>) meaning that there is tender fruit of life in Christians as they accept the death of Jesus, and come out of it.<a name=84:8></a> There is tender fruit in the way of life, delightful to the eye of God, and it corresponds, as I said, with the passage in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>, which really alludes to <i>tender</i> grass; it is fresh in life.<a name=84:9></a> That is what God is looking for.<a name=84:10></a> The passage in Romans does not refer to freshness but it refers to newness -- it refers to something different from any life you can depict in this world.<a name=84:11></a> There is no life like it.<a name=84:12></a> It is a new kind of life, and that is what God is looking for, dear friends, that we also should walk in newness of life.<a name=84:13></a> In other words, there is this man, he is a carpenter, or this, a stone-mason, or this, a clerk behind a counter, and he is converted, and he gets the Holy Spirit, and you look at him on Monday morning and he is different, he is not what he used to be.<a name=84:14></a> There is no logic in talking about being converted, or a believer, aside

		Well now, that is what God is looking for; that is what I had in mind in these passages, and the passage in Mark is especially significant, because the Lord in that chapter gives us the celebrated parable of the seed sown by the sower, and He was that Himself, the Son of man, and He brings in this instruction, which every farmer will verify, that the earth brings forth fruit of itself.<a name=85:6></a> And now dear brethren, or friends, if we desire fruit, the next thing is what kind of seed are we to sow?<a name=85:7></a> The word of God is the seed; the Lord calls the seed the word of the kingdom, but Peter speaks of the incorruptible seed, "the living and abiding word of God", (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:23">1 Peter  1:23</a>).<a name=85:8></a>

		'You have heard what this brother says about Paul; they say his speech is naught; they would discredit him'.<a name=96:1></a> The Spirit of God would say to every young person at Corinth, 'See to it you do not do what is wrong.<a name=96:2></a> Leave Paul for a moment.<a name=96:3></a> See to yourself.<a name=96:4></a> See you do not do what is wrong'.<a name=96:5></a> That is the word, dear brethren, at all times, especially in crises and difficulties amongst us; it is for each to see to it that he does not do what is wrong.<a name=96:6></a> That is what the apostle stresses here.<a name=96:7></a> He says, 'My prayer for you is not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest or right'.<a name=96:8></a> That is, every one.<a name=96:9></a> If I am under a cloud, I may say others have put me there, but then <i>I</i> must do what is right, whatever <i>others</i> may do.<a name=96:10></a> I must do what is right.<a name=96:11></a> See then you do what is right, and that is the sure way of deliverance, whatever the deliverance may be.<a name=96:12></a> Righteousness is stamped across the position at the present time -- it is a question of what is right.<a name=96:13></a> If I pursue what is right, I will reach the end I desire.<a name=96:14></a> If I am a righteous person, I do not want any other end, and every time I do what is right, I am nearer to the end I desire.<a name=96:15></a>

		So that is the point the apostle makes here: that ye do what is right and what is honest.<a name=96:16></a> Each one is to take that to heart.<a name=96:17></a> And then as the Lord shows in His word to John, there is the idea of fulfilling all righteousness.<a name=96:18></a> It is not only righteousness in general, or in the main features of any matter, but <i>all</i> righteousness.<a name=96:19></a> I am speaking now of standards.<a name=96:20></a> I know full well what each of us is.<a name=96:21></a> James says, "We all often offend", (<a href="../bible/James.htm#3:2">James  3:2</a>).<a name=96:22></a> One ought to say that, feeling that he is the one mentioned.<a name=96:23></a> But then the standard is the point, and the Lord here is the standard.<a name=96:24></a> The more we adhere to the standard in spirit or in attitude, the more we shall be conformed to it.<a name=96:25></a> The Lord here sets a standard.<a name=96:26></a> "Thus it becometh us".<a name=96:27></a> It is not "Me", though He is supreme in it, of course.<a name=96:28></a> It is one of the finest statements in

		So as to the third point, in Timothy, the idea of leadership is a very great thought of God, one of the greatest thoughts of God, and in view of current conditions, that is, in view of the general breakdown contemplated in this well known epistle, the leader here is righteousness.<a name=97:10></a> Of course, Paul is still alive, and he enjoins Timothy to do what he heard and saw in him.<a name=97:11></a> No one led in such a way as Paul.<a name=97:12></a> He said, "Be ye followers of me" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:1">1 Corinthians  11:1</a>).<a name=97:13></a> He is the only one who says or could say that.<a name=97:14></a> The Spirit of God says it through him.<a name=97:15></a> There was one man here who answered to the mind of God in so far as it can be in a creature.<a name=97:16></a> "Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ", (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:1">1 Corinthians  11:1</a>).<a name=97:17></a> So he sent Timothy to Corinth to remind them of his ways; not simply of his teaching or preaching, but of his ways, as they were in Christ; that they might see them in the beloved child, Timotheus.<a name=97:18></a> So that the idea of leadership is clearly in a man or men, but in broken times, before we can clearly see a man as a leader, we must see righteousness as a leader.<a name=97:19></a> The first thing is to learn that leader, to know it, to keep it clearly in mind.<a name=97:20></a> It is simply this, that under all circumstances, I must do right.<a name=97:21></a> That is simply what is meant; not only that I do it, but I am pursuing it; not only that I am doing it now, but I am pursuing it now.<a name=97:22></a> It is a steady thing before the mind; the necessity for doing right is ever present in all emergencies in our histories here.<a name=97:23></a> The necessity for right would always

		In my word at this time, dear brethren, I have in mind to enlarge on the idea of planting, divine planting.<a name=118:1></a> It is a very old idea, as old as man, and, according to the Scriptures, God is the first who planted.<a name=118:2></a> He planted a garden, we are told.<a name=118:3></a> The earth in itself had the power of fruit-bearing; it was to bring forth and cause grass, herbs and trees to spring up, suggestive of what we call natural latent fertility, but later it is said that God planted a garden eastward in Eden and He caused a river to flow out of the garden to water it.<a name=118:4></a> It was a spot that henceforth would be of special interest to Him, but the growth was not left to nature.<a name=118:5></a> It was to be watched over, Adam was placed in the garden to dress it and keep it.<a name=118:6></a> It was of divine planting, God planting a garden.<a name=118:7></a> Every gardener who had the opportunity would visit the garden for it was perfect, every tree in its place.<a name=118:8></a> God not only considers for fruit, but shelter and ornamentation in the garden; He made everything perfect and the garden would certainly have been worth visiting as divinely planted and rooted, to say no more.<a name=118:9></a> We know what happened in the garden, but I am speaking of it now as the first instance of planting.<a name=118:10></a> The interval between it and <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#15">Matthew  15</a>was long, but the Planter is the same, only instead of the Lord God planting we have the Father planting.<a name=118:11></a> The Lord Jesus is the speaker.<a name=118:12></a> He is not enlarging on the planting, but alludes to the Father planting; others planted also, but the Lord alludes to the Father's planting by way of contrast.<a name=118:13></a> There were other planters, as there are today.<a name=118:14></a> "Every plant which my heavenly Father has not planted shall be rooted up".<a name=118:15></a> The Lord made this remark in answer to His disciples, "Dost thou know that the Pharisees, having heard this word, have been offended?<a name=118:16></a>" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#15:12">Matthew  15:12</a>) The Pharisees!<a name=118:17></a> These men were

		I have read these scriptures because they each contain the word 'partaker'; by the Lord's help I wish to dwell on the word in these four settings.<a name=126:1></a> I have particularly in view to stress that Christianity is substantial, not merely theoretical or doctrinal, as in ancient and current religions accepted by the world.<a name=126:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christianity is substantial in a spiritual sense, based on the great fact of the incarnation, which is substantiated by Paul, and is an essential thought.<a name=126:3></a> God is said to be a spirit, but in the economy He has come into He is known in manhood, as it is said, "God .<a name=126:4></a>.<a name=126:5></a>.<a name=126:6></a> manifest in flesh".<a name=126:7></a> Much is developed from that fact, to establish the great principle of substance in a spiritual sense in such wise as to be within the range of the creature, to be intelligible to us whose constitutions are substantial.<a name=126:8></a> True indeed, man's condition involves spirit.<a name=126:9></a> 'Spirit, soul and body' is the formula by which he is known, and our Lord Jesus has become partaker of this condition.<a name=126:10></a> The word used is 'partaker'.<a name=126:11></a> It is a real matter, not imaginary humanity, but a real humanity; so much so that the angel Gabriel, speaking of the Son of God to Mary, the mother of our Lord, said to her, "The holy thing also which shall be born shall be called Son of God" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:35">Luke  1:35</a>).<a name=126:12></a> It is not holy Person or Babe, but holy <i>Thing</i>.<a name=126:13></a>

		John says by the Spirit, any spirit that confesses not Jesus Christ come in flesh is not of God.<a name=126:14></a> It is not that He was Jesus Christ before becoming flesh, but the allusion is to the Person who had part in the Deity as presented in John.<a name=126:15></a> In this gospel he presents the Word as with God, and the Word was God.<a name=126:16></a> But to make this come within our range involved the fact of the

		incarnation.<a name=127:1></a> It is Jesus Christ come in flesh, and moreover He came by water and by blood; that does not refer to birth, but to His death.<a name=127:2></a> Jesus Christ come in flesh alludes to incarnation.<a name=127:3></a> Jesus Christ coming by water and by blood refers to the death of Christ.<a name=127:4></a> Incarnation alone would have been ineffectual.<a name=127:5></a> There could be no redemption save that He came by water and by blood.<a name=127:6></a> The condition in which we were needed water for cleansing of our moral state, and blood for dealing with our transgressions, offences and guilt.<a name=127:7></a> His coming in flesh refers to tangible things, and pours contempt on mysticism and spiritism.<a name=127:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christianity is founded on substantiality and divinity, and so, as I said, Gabriel begins with that thought, that holy <i>Thing</i> which is to be called Son of God.<a name=127:9></a> How much and how effectively the Spirit of God enables the saints to understand the holy name of Christ, and would impress upon our hearts that although it is in relation to birth, it, nevertheless, marks Him off as divine, such as is in mind in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#1:4">Romans  1:4</a>, "marked out Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of the dead".<a name=127:10></a> A wonderful thought.<a name=127:11></a> He is marked off.<a name=127:12></a> The writer of the Hebrews says, "Since therefore the children partake of blood and flesh, he also, in like manner, took part in the same", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:14">Hebrews  2:14</a>.<a name=127:13></a> The children alluded to were the saints in Old or New Testament times.<a name=127:14></a> "He does not indeed take hold of angels by the hand, but he takes hold of the seed of Abraham", (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:16">Hebrews  2:16</a>).<a name=127:15></a> It was a genuine real thought.<a name=127:16></a> He took flesh and blood in that condition, in order to yield what was in the way of divine blessing for the children, the divine thought for man.<a name=127:17></a> So that is what I have in mind in these remarks.<a name=127:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are dealing with what is substantial, and God would bring us into substantiality in ourselves, and not to be mere hearers, as many are, mentally assenting to doctrines and principles without substantial results in our souls.<a name=127:19></a> And so the first scripture alludes to the

		saints as a body, and this is a substantial thought.<a name=128:1></a> What I have in mind corresponds with our Lord as He partook in flesh and blood, and took a body.<a name=128:2></a> We have to distinguish between the idea of the body, and the idea of the condition.<a name=128:3></a> Of course the condition involved the body, but the idea of the body furnishes an instrument, and the thought is carried on to the saints from Christ.<a name=128:4></a> The thought in this verse is -- we being many are one body, all partakers of that one loaf.<a name=128:5></a> The bread which we break is the communion or the fellowship of the body of Christ.<a name=128:6></a> We Christians, although many, are one body, expressed in the symbol in the Lord's supper, but expressed spiritually, and in spiritual substantiality.<a name=128:7></a> The links and bonds by which we are held, held by joints and bands, all that enters into the organism.<a name=128:8></a> The saints sitting down to partake of the Lord's supper as a unit are held as a body, and the idea corresponds with what was said by the Lord, coming into the world, "Thou hast prepared me a body",(<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:5">Hebrews  10:5</a>).<a name=128:9></a> It was not something previous to, but begins with, incarnation, coming here, as in Luke, and He speaks in it, and intimates to God that He would glorify Him in it.<a name=128:10></a> All the divine will should be, and was, carried out.<a name=128:11></a> He has now gone up to heaven bodily, but the idea of the body remains in a substantial way in the saints collectively.<a name=128:12></a> They are usable to God as units.<a name=128:13></a> But the one great idea of God in the saints in relation to Christ, and of the saints answering to the thoughts divinely seen, such as "So also is the Christ" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:12">1 Corinthians  12:12</a>), is that the saints are baptised by one Spirit into one body, and are viewed as a holy vessel here.<a name=128:14></a> It is a wonderful thought.<a name=128:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Attention is called to the partakers in a locality here, a local assembly; we have the wonderful statement "So also is the Christ" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:12">1 Corinthians  12:12</a>).<a name=128:16></a> We are of Christ, not that we are the body; it is a question of the character of it here, not the whole thought, but the character of it, the collective idea; "Ye are Christ's body" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:27">1 Corinthians  12:27</a>), where two

		In <a href="../bible/John.htm#6">John  6</a>, one of the most substantial chapters in Scripture, the Lord has in mind that we should be in life.<a name=129:11></a> So that at the end of the chapter, we have Peter saying, "Lord, to whom shall we go?<a name=129:12></a> thou hast words of life eternal; and we have believed and known that thou art the holy one of God" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#6:68">John  6:68</a>,69).<a name=129:13></a> We being many are one bread, one body.<a name=129:14></a> This thought is to be carried by the saints in every locality.<a name=129:15></a> It is very practical if we understand the great thought.<a name=129:16></a> We may be in the holy bond of fellowship.<a name=129:17></a> That is what God intends us to be in this town.<a name=129:18></a> Of course one could say much more, but I wanted to present four sides of the subject.<a name=129:19></a> It is very practical as to what we are going on with; it challenges us as to whether we are making room for these things.<a name=129:20></a>

		So, to David, a man of like passions with ourselves, we have this beautiful tribute by the apostle Paul: "Having in his own generation ministered to the will of God, fell asleep".<a name=135:1></a> This is a greater thing than to minister to others, for it fills out what the mind of God delights in.<a name=135:2></a> There may be great exploits without ministering to the will of God, without that steady adherence to and support of what pleases God.<a name=135:3></a> It is what God has in any one of us that is the whole matter.<a name=135:4></a> "Fear God, and keep his commandments", one has said, is "the whole of man" (<a href="../bible/Ecclesiastes.htm#12:13">Ecclesiastes  12:13</a>).<a name=135:5></a> It is what accrues to God that will tell; it is what <i>has told</i>, beloved brethren, and what <i>will tell</i> in that day when things are manifested.<a name=135:6></a>

		It is on my heart to speak of David and Solomon as marked by deep feelings and affections.<a name=136:1></a> These are expressed in their writings, and I may say they furnish for us the very heart and soul of the Old Testament.<a name=136:2></a> They remind us that God will have His people move in the expression of divinely begotten feelings and affections.<a name=136:3></a> Amongst other things it is to be observed that these feelings and affections come from two kings; that is, men of immense affairs.<a name=136:4></a> We might assume that poetic, and even any other kind of writings, should be left to others; and that such men as David and Solomon had to give so much attention to military and state affairs, that they could scarcely be expected to give time to such a service as this; yet they reflect what God is, and what Christ is, in regard of this service.<a name=136:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As an illustration of this, we see how God, coming to Abraham in company with two others, could afford to wait upon Abraham until he had prepared a meal; and in the New Testament we see how the Lord Jesus Christ could devote time to individuals; as, for instance, on the two wayward disciples going to Emmaus.<a name=136:6></a> It is touching to see how the Father and the Son can afford to devote Themselves to one individual, for in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>the Lord says that the Father and the Son would come and make Their abode with one who loved the Lord and kept His word.<a name=136:7></a> Taking all these things into account, we can understand how David could find time to write psalms, and how Solomon could speak three thousand proverbs and write a thousand and five songs.<a name=136:8></a> Think of the great emperor of that day able to devote himself to such services!<a name=136:9></a>

		This Song shows how love is begotten, and in chapter 1:7 the lover of Christ wishes to know where He feeds His flock and where He makes it to rest at noon.<a name=137:7></a> That is, he wishes to see how Christ serves all His flock, and this is what leads up to the Lord's service to the saints as of the assembly -- His best service is seen there.<a name=137:8></a> It is illustrated in Jacob, when he quickly rolled away the stone from the well's mouth as Rachel comes into view.<a name=137:9></a> So it is that the best service of Christ is expended on the saints who form the assembly.<a name=137:10></a> Therefore we can understand the desire of this lover of Christ to see Him thus serving, so that she says, "Why should I be as one veiled beside the flocks of thy companions?<a name=137:11></a>" Why should any one of us be under suspicion in regard to our love to Christ?<a name=137:12></a> If one has not come forward and put out his hand to the fellowship of the people of God, his love is under suspicion.<a name=137:13></a> Whatever you may say about your love, we cannot be sure of it, for love is not merely spoken of, but it manifests itself, as in the case of Ruth.<a name=137:14></a> She says, "Intreat me not to leave thee" (<a href="../bible/Ruth.htm#1:16">Ruth  1:16</a>); she would be a companion of Naomi.<a name=137:15></a> She would have Naomi's people to be her people, Naomi's God to be her God; where Naomi died would Ruth die, and there would she be buried.<a name=137:16></a> That is complete identification.<a name=137:17></a> Hence, if one is not

		This chapter records the making of the calf and the mixture of good and evil; even after the position was clear and Jehovah came in, a mixture still remained, for the tabernacle was pitched outside the camp, and certain ones went out; that is, those that sought the Lord.<a name=165:5></a> Others remained in their tents, so that this section would teach us the importance of whole-heartedness in a crisis, to avoid mixed feelings, and above all, to avoid latitudinarian thoughts or a compromise between the truth and error.<a name=165:6></a> That is what was begun at Bethesda, a sort of straggle; there is always the tendency to put truth and error on the same plane, or perhaps to call good, evil, or evil, good.<a name=165:7></a> So I thought it would be wholesome to look at this incident as showing whole-heartedness and loyalty to God and to Christ; encouraging us to be on His side, and not on any other.<a name=165:8></a>

		J.T.<a name=209:1></a> It is thought that the subject of "the rod of God" might come under our consideration.<a name=209:2></a> The verses read in the New Testament are suggested because they show the connection in which the rod is used; firstly, in relation to the ministry; how the minister, having qualified in moral power with God, has certain authority.<a name=209:3></a> Of course, in this case it was apostolic, but still the Lord said that He gave to His <i>bondmen</i> the authority, as if it were left here on that principle, as in the bondman.<a name=209:4></a> Then in Revelation we see it in its extreme severity, as in the hands of the Lord Jesus in the world to come, when He will rule the nations, not only with a rod, but with a rod of <i>iron</i>.<a name=209:5></a> We have it in Revelation also as a means of measurement.<a name=209:6></a> In chapter 11 the temple, the altar and the worshippers were measured by the rod that was given to the prophet; the New Testament thus showing the significance of the rod of God, but the Old Testament opens up the details of it.<a name=209:7></a> It is connected with Moses, who peculiarly represented God in the sense of authority; for the idea of authority runs through and is connected with the rod.<a name=209:8></a> The word used is sometimes translated "staff" in the New Translation, which probably alludes to its use by one in his pilgrimage or journeying, or, as in Moses' case, in caring for the sheep of his father-in-law; it evidently represents therefore the experience that the believer acquires with God, and according to that measure he is used and becomes authoritative in a moral sense amongst the people of God.<a name=209:9></a> Then also, we shall see, as we proceed, how it works out against the resources of Egypt in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#7">Exodus  7</a>, and in chapter 14 against death,

		J.T.<a name=210:18></a> Well, it would show that extreme measures will obtain in the millennium as having in mind the preservation of all.<a name=210:19></a> In Corinth, the extreme measure directed by Paul to be taken against the incestuous person, has in view the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit might be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus; it was not for destruction really, but for preservation.<a name=210:20></a> Paul says, "If any one love not the Lord Jesus Christ let him be Anathema Maranatha", which means that if one is not true he will be accursed when the Lord comes.<a name=210:21></a> The rod will mean a curse; so that in the millennium the sinner of one hundred years is to be cut off, yet the general principle is shepherding and there is an effective means of doing this.<a name=210:22></a> It will be carried out in righteousness; "When thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness", <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#26:9">Isaiah  26:9</a>.<a name=210:23></a> Severity is the best kind of service to render; the effect of it is to break down the flesh, and preserve the person from walking after it.<a name=210:24></a>

		It may be helpful to point out that the introduction to this subject in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#4">Exodus  4</a>arose from Moses' conscious weakness.<a name=214:7></a> He says to Jehovah, "But behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice; for they will say, Jehovah has not appeared to thee.<a name=214:8></a> And Jehovah said to him.<a name=214:9></a> What is that in thy hand?<a name=214:10></a> And he said, A staff.<a name=214:11></a> And he said.<a name=214:12></a> Cast it on the ground.<a name=214:13></a> And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.<a name=214:14></a> And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand and take it by the tail -- and he stretched out his hand and caught it, and it became a staff in his hand" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#4:1">Exodus  4:1</a> - 4).<a name=214:15></a> And then the explanation is given, "that they may believe that Jehovah, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee".<a name=214:16></a> This was the first sign and it was to induce faith, so it says, "that they may believe that Jehovah .<a name=214:17></a>.<a name=214:18></a>.<a name=214:19></a> hath appeared unto thee".<a name=214:20></a> So that authority is a great matter; it induces faith.<a name=214:21></a> Paul received grace and apostleship for obedience of faith among all the nations; that is, authority was vested in him.<a name=214:22></a>

		You can understand how these evil men would talk of Paul, and some might go so far as to say that he was a reprobate.<a name=341:2></a> Suppose I <i>am</i> a reprobate, Paul would say, even though it be so; whatever others say or think about <i>me, you</i> do what is right; whatever you may think about me, you do what is right.<a name=341:3></a> Our minds may become darkened so that we begin to excuse ourselves and say, Look at what is reported of Paul; why should not I be excused if I do the same things?<a name=341:4></a> The apostle would say.<a name=341:5></a> Whatever others do, <i>you</i> do what is right.<a name=341:6></a> This is obvious, and yet our weak hearts are often ready to hide behind a false report, also to imply that two wrongs make one right.<a name=341:7></a>

		The first thing I call attention to in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#85">Psalm  85</a>is that the psalmist in verse 8 says, "I will hear what God, Jehovah, will speak; for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his godly ones: but let them not turn again to folly" <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#85:8">Psalm  85:8</a>.<a name=342:6></a> Now that is a word that fits many of us at this moment, in regard to various circumstances; let us say, "I will hear what God, Jehovah, will speak" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#85:8">Psalm  85:8</a>).<a name=342:7></a> What a fitting resolve!<a name=342:8></a> When faced with a problem, we may say, I will see what so-and-so has to say; he is a good brother.<a name=342:9></a> In a way it is quite right, but be sure of the person from whom you seek help.<a name=342:10></a> Can he give it to you?<a name=342:11></a> The point here is, "I will hear what God, Jehovah, will speak" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#85:8">Psalm  85:8</a>).<a name=342:12></a> <i>He</i> is ready to speak.<a name=342:13></a> Am I ready to hear?<a name=342:14></a> What does He say to me about all these happenings?<a name=342:15></a> There is something for everyone in them.<a name=342:16></a> It is an educational time for us; am I going to miss my part?<a name=342:17></a> If I am not, I must revert to the motive that led me into these things, and turn to God as to it.<a name=342:18></a> "I will hear what God, Jehovah, will speak" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#85:8">Psalm  85:8</a>).<a name=342:19></a> He will not spare me, but will let me hear what He has in His mind for me.<a name=342:20></a> It goes on to say, "He will speak peace unto his people, and to his godly ones" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#85:8">Psalm  85:8</a>).<a name=342:21></a> That is, God would say, I recognise these.<a name=342:22></a> Thank God for any little way in which God recognises us as His people -- that He has something here below -- a peculiar people, a people for a possession.<a name=342:23></a> He visited to take out of the nations a people for His Name, but then the godly ones -- that is another matter.<a name=342:24></a> We cannot be His

		Next it says, "Loving-kindness and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other".<a name=343:11></a> That is, there is a complete harmonious state of things -- a meeting together and a kissing of each other by these great qualities.<a name=343:12></a> It is a perfect state of things.<a name=343:13></a> Love enters into it.<a name=343:14></a> Mercy and truth are in a perfect blend, they have met together.<a name=343:15></a> They are not in each other's way.<a name=343:16></a> They are not sundered by man's will, which may make too much of mercy and not enough of truth, and so be out of balance.<a name=343:17></a> They represent a fixed order of things in which God is glorified and men's needs are met.<a name=343:18></a> Happy it is where these great qualities are thus met together, man's will having ceased to act.<a name=343:19></a> Obedience has taken the place of disobedience, and righteousness and peace have kissed each other.<a name=343:20></a> Thus you can see that a fixed order of things requires the insistence of righteousness.<a name=343:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=364:15></a> I thought that.<a name=364:16></a> Verse 26 brings in what the persons are to whom He is priest; He "became us".<a name=364:17></a> Such a One as is depicted in the chapter was needed because of the greatness of those to whom He is Priest.<a name=364:18></a> As I was remarking, priesthood covers a wide range, but it is <i>provisional</i> .<a name=364:19></a> The basis of drawing near to God is sonship; as in the primary thought in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#4:23">Exodus  4:23</a> "Let my son go, that he may serve me", so in this epistle God is leading many sons, not priests, but sons, to glory; the priesthood therefore is a provisional thought, because of conditions in us and about us in drawing near in our relation with God; hence the priesthood is brought in in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#28">Exodus  28</a>in view of the service.<a name=364:20></a> God said, "Let my son go, that he may serve me",(<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#4:23">Exodus  4:23</a>) and the priesthood is brought in for that purpose, that sons

		To bring out the force of this passage, and the power and instruction behind it, I have read the other scriptures.<a name=380:3></a> <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15">Luke  15</a>brings God in, parabolically, as kissing.<a name=380:4></a> How He does it we have to discover in a spiritual sense, but He does it, and in that sense furnishes a lead for us in the exercise of this well-known way of conveying love.<a name=380:5></a> The more we advance in the knowledge of God, the more spiritual we are, not only in feeling, but in understanding, so that by the Spirit we arrive at meanings and definitions.<a name=380:6></a> Meanings are sometimes indefinable, and especially so in what God does.<a name=380:7></a> What we hear, of course, takes form in our minds, for the ear tries words, and the mind has power to distinguish their meaning.<a name=380:8></a> But there is the <i>reception</i> of what is conveyed, apart from which what is heard fails of its object.<a name=380:9></a> It is what is received with meekness that bears fruit.<a name=380:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In this instance we have conveyed to us parabolically the idea of God kissing, and we have to learn from Him.<a name=380:11></a> It is, I need not say, a holy kiss, and the word implies kissing ardently or caressingly.<a name=380:12></a> The father covered him with kisses.<a name=380:13></a> The impression is conveyed that it is not a mere matter of formal greeting; it is much more than that.<a name=380:14></a> Nor is the thought conveyed of any evident lovableness in the person.<a name=380:15></a> Not that he was not lovable, for a repentant sinner is lovable.<a name=380:16></a> Repentance is one of the most interesting items on earth

	<div class="paragraph">
		These scriptures, as you will observe, link the thoughts of leader and saviour together; they present them in Christ personally and also in others who participated in His Spirit in Old Testament times.<a name=431:1></a> It is the divine thought, that whether in those who participated in His Spirit before His incarnation, or in those who receive the Spirit from Him, redemption being accomplished, there should be in all services a correspondence to Christ.<a name=431:2></a> This is the divine standard, and where the Spirit has His place this will be attained.<a name=431:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We find that both Peter and Paul, assuming that the epistle to the Hebrews was written by the latter, laid stress on these two thoughts.<a name=431:4></a> It will be noticed that the word "leader" comes first in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#5">Acts  5</a>; the word "prince" being properly "leader".<a name=431:5></a> This word is used four times in the New Testament, and only by Peter and Paul.<a name=431:6></a> Both Peter and Paul use the word twice.<a name=431:7></a> Peter uses it in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#5">Acts  5</a>and also in chapter 3 of this book; Paul uses it once in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>and once in chapter 12.<a name=431:8></a> In each of these cases, save the one in the passage read, the use is specific.<a name=431:9></a> The first mention of the word in the New Testament is in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#3:15">Acts  3:15</a>, where it stands in relation to <i>life</i> .<a name=431:10></a> In that passage the New Translation renders it "originator"; that is to say, Christ is the Originator of life, but then, the word means more than is ordinarily understood by that term.<a name=431:11></a> It means that He set the thing out, exemplified it; a most important matter, especially in leadership, that one should be the thing.<a name=431:12></a> The word, as seen in these passages, could apply to Christ only.<a name=431:13></a> So that we have, as I said, in the first reference, the Originator, or Leader of life.<a name=431:14></a> Life according to God is seen in Christ; in Him was life, we are told, and He has expressed it; and thus we understand it from Him.<a name=431:15></a>

		In this passage, Israel is in view, but of course repentance and remission have a universal bearing.<a name=432:6></a> What a need there is for them!<a name=432:7></a> The idea of repentance must be kept before us, for we are apt to think of it as a historical matter only, once effected, with a result that is final, but Scripture regards repentance as continuous, and the need for the Leader and Saviour to give it, continues.<a name=432:8></a> The need of this combined service to unconverted people is obvious, but it is necessary for Christians, too, since in our case also there can be no remission without repentance; hence the necessity of the combined service of Christ for repentance and remission of sins.<a name=432:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Spirit of God tells us that Peter and the apostles said these things, showing that the ground is very firm testimonially.<a name=432:10></a> God is pleased at times to furnish an excess of testimony in order to enforce what is in His mind.<a name=432:11></a> Then Peter adds that the apostles were witnesses -- qualified persons, who were not only called upon to testify as to the truth, but were called upon by the Lord to "be my witnesses", as He said (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:8">Acts  1:8</a>).<a name=432:12></a> Earlier He had said, <i>"ye</i> are witnesses",(<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:48">Luke  24:48</a>).<a name=432:13></a> To be a valid witness, one has to be a witness by experience or observation, and that was so of the apostles; these men were qualified witnesses, because of having seen or heard the things they testified to.<a name=432:14></a> They were qualified as trustworthy witnesses.<a name=432:15></a> Witnesses may fail

		us; our minds, too, are treacherous and we may fail to witness correctly, but these men were competent as witnesses.<a name=433:1></a> One of the most important things to learn is how to keep divine things in our minds; to have the ability to recall them as learnt; and so the Lord said to the apostles that the Holy Spirit whom the Father would send in His name, would bring to their remembrance all things whatever Christ had said to them.<a name=433:2></a> It lies in the power of the Spirit to do this, so that there should be accurate testimony; so that what we say is accurate, and we know it to be so.<a name=433:3></a> In truth, we speak so lightly and so superficially, that it is necessary that we be reminded that to witness really and truly we need the Spirit of God.<a name=433:4></a>

		So the apostle says, "we are his witnesses .<a name=433:5></a>.<a name=433:6></a>.<a name=433:7></a> and the Holy Spirit also".<a name=433:8></a> And then, so as to make the position clear, he says, "which God has given to those that obey him".<a name=433:9></a> We may say no testimony is reliable, save in those who are obedient, who obey God.<a name=433:10></a> If I have something selfish to establish through my testimony, I cannot be relied upon.<a name=433:11></a> In the very nature of things I am not reliable.<a name=433:12></a> It is the Spirit given to those who obey Him -- that is, those who obey God.<a name=433:13></a> The Spirit is here thus; not in any theoretic way, but in persons, in those who <i>obey God</i> .<a name=433:14></a> It is in that sense that the Spirit is here in testimony; He has obedient persons, available persons, who can testify.<a name=433:15></a> God gives Him to those who obey Him.<a name=433:16></a> Let no one speak of having the Spirit aside from the element of obedience.<a name=433:17></a> So that Peter says, God has exalted Jesus "as leader and saviour, to give repentance .<a name=433:18></a>.<a name=433:19></a>.<a name=433:20></a> and remission of sins.<a name=433:21></a> And <i>we</i> are his witnesses .<a name=433:22></a>.<a name=433:23></a>.<a name=433:24></a> and the Holy Spirit also, which God has given to those that obey him".<a name=433:25></a> What a witness to Christ in heaven!<a name=433:26></a> Thus we see the testimony coming through vessels that are qualified, first by appointment and then by possession of the Spirit whom God gives to those who obey Him.<a name=433:27></a> That is the position in this passage.<a name=433:28></a>

		Now I want to enlarge on this as reflected in the Old Testament, and I have selected the book of Judges; a peculiar book in the sense that it was written by the Spirit of God to depict conditions at a time of departure from God; but of great energy on God's part to meet the departure, and to save all possible.<a name=434:1></a> It is a salvaging book in a sense, and it shows that the greater the effort of the enemy in turning souls away from God, the greater the energy of God to recover and preserve all possible.<a name=434:2></a> As the apostle Paul says, "if by any means I .<a name=434:3></a>.<a name=434:4></a>.<a name=434:5></a> might save some" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#9:22">1 Corinthians  9:22</a>).<a name=434:6></a> We cannot afford to lose one of the saints, and the leadership and saviourship of Christ is available and effective through repentance and remission of sins to this end, and there is no other way.<a name=434:7></a> If sin is at work in departure from God, the enemy has scope, which he uses to lead the saints captive.<a name=434:8></a> Think of being thus affected -- one once regarded as a lover of Christ now against Christ!<a name=434:9></a> Why?<a name=434:10></a> Because Satan has captivated him for his will.<a name=434:11></a> And so this book shows the power of God, that by His operation, through chosen vessels, the tide of evil might be stemmed, as the apostle said, "that I might by all means save some" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#9:22">1 Corinthians  9:22</a>).<a name=434:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, I wish to dwell first on leadership, and the gist of what I have in mind is <i>that leaders led</i> .<a name=434:13></a> A saviour is raised up, too; and he <i>saves</i> .<a name=434:14></a> He is not a mere titled man, but one that does the thing.<a name=434:15></a> So Deborah says the leaders led; and then in chapter 3, a saviour saved.<a name=434:16></a> That is a principle set forth in this book.<a name=434:17></a> No one has a right to any title of this kind, save as he can produce the result.<a name=434:18></a> It is the result that tells, and so it was with Othniel -- he <i>saved</i> Israel.<a name=434:19></a> God raised up a saviour to the children of Israel, who saved them.<a name=434:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in regard of leadership, we have in chapter 5, which is one of the finest sections of the book, that the thing done is celebrated with a song.<a name=434:21></a> I have thought lately, that we do not sing enough; that singing in assembly service is curtailed amongst us to our loss, and that God loses through it, too.<a name=434:22></a> Indeed, it is my

		feeling that the service of God is largely in song.<a name=435:1></a> And so this chapter stands out prominently in the book as consolidating what was achieved in chapter 4.<a name=435:2></a> The word <i>consolidated</i> is a good one, and I believe the spiritual singing is very important as tending to consolidate the things that we have received or acquired.<a name=435:3></a> The apostle Paul in referring to the truth of the gospel, says to the Corinthians, "which also ye received" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:1">1 Corinthians  15:1</a>), but they failed to consolidate it.<a name=435:4></a> He says, "which I announced to you, which also ye received" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:1">1 Corinthians  15:1</a>), but then adds, "unless indeed ye have believed in vain" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:2">1 Corinthians  15:2</a>).<a name=435:5></a> What is received in the way of testimony from God in our minds must be consolidated, and that is very largely through singing.<a name=435:6></a> I do not overlook other things, of course, but I stress this thought, dear brethren, that we may look into it and see if we are neglecting the thought of singing, and disregarding its value in the service of God.<a name=435:7></a> I am not now thinking of singing as a pastime, but "speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and chanting with your heart to the Lord" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:19">Ephesians  5:19</a>).<a name=435:8></a> The soul thus becomes filled and carried along as with a current; under those conditions Christianity becomes a reality to us, Christ being our theme.<a name=435:9></a>

		Now Deborah, who speaks of herself very soberly and humbly in chapter 4, refuses to take the lead, but puts Barak forward -- a fine example for sisters.<a name=435:10></a> She did all she could to make a poor leader a good one, and she succeeded.<a name=435:11></a> It is within the province of the sisters to do this, to so compass the brothers, to so move, as to convey to them the place which is theirs as head and to take up that place.<a name=435:12></a> "I will by all means go with thee" (<a href="../bible/Judges.htm#4:9">Judges  4:9</a>), she said, but he was to take the lead.<a name=435:13></a> She put him forward and he went forward.<a name=435:14></a> "Up", she says, and Barak went forward, and there went up at his feet ten thousand men.<a name=435:15></a> And Deborah went with him.<a name=435:16></a> She had said to Barak, "I will by all means go with thee, only that it will not be to thine honour upon the way which thou goest" (<a href="../bible/Judges.htm#4:9">Judges  4:9</a>).<a name=435:17></a> Hundreds of years afterwards he

		J.T.<a name=488:1></a> The scriptures read, involving fishing scenes, are intended of the Lord to help us first in regard to fellowship (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#5">Luke  5</a>); then in regard to Christ in resurrection (<a href="../bible/John.htm#21">John  21</a>); and finally (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#17">Matthew  17</a>), in regard to sonship, our association with Him in sonship.<a name=488:2></a> The reason why fellowship is suggested in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#5">Luke  5</a>, is that we have the word <i>partners</i> used twice.<a name=488:3></a> There are two words, both signifying fellowship.<a name=488:4></a> The first, in verse 7, is partnership that can be reckoned on to afford assistance; the second time the word occurs, in verse 10, it denotes fellowship in the true sense, what we have in common.<a name=488:5></a> I think it will be seen that the Spirit of God has recorded the facts of this remarkable miracle with this end in view; for there are many who are glad to receive help, and count on others for it, but who do not go so far as the recognition of fixed relations in fellowship.<a name=488:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=488:9></a> Well, it is rather two phases of the same thing, the first is in the sense that others are obligated to help you spiritually, and you count on that.<a name=488:10></a> In a certain way generally, all are in that relation.<a name=488:11></a> So, in the need that existed, they called on their partners in the other ship to come and help them.<a name=488:12></a> They were in the other ship, but still partnership existed.<a name=488:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=489:17></a> Well, it is a question of the obligation to help, but I would hardly go so far as to include them in the fellowship, because the word in verse 10 as applied to Christians contemplates mutual obligation to be free of evil.<a name=489:18></a> The use made of it in 1 Corinthians implies that we are obligated to one another in regard to our associations in the light; but certainly as those who know that, we are ready to own our obligations to Christians, to help them, whoever or wherever they may be.<a name=489:19></a> I was only thinking of the idea of help, that there were those who could be reckoned on for help in time of need.<a name=489:20></a> That was what I had in mind, not to extend the idea of fellowship in 1 Corinthians to all, because it cannot be extended to them save in the sense that they are free of evil, at least in principle.<a name=489:21></a> But then, there is the obligation to <i>help</i> any Christian.<a name=489:22></a>

		J.T.<a name=490:8></a> Well, I am glad you mention that, because there is a constant danger of what we may call Congregationalism -- independency and self-sufficiency in meetings.<a name=490:9></a> Whilst in a certain sense it is designed that the local assembly should be self-sustaining, as having the Spirit and the elderhood, yet the universal fellowship must not be lost sight of, and that any help or ability to help anywhere should be available, and availed of too, in a seemly and subject way.<a name=490:10></a> The thought fits in here, they were within range, it was not a message sent, they were <i>beckoned</i> to.<a name=490:11></a>

		The Lord says here, "Go into the city" -- an expression that also has a great place in Scripture.<a name=505:6></a> The great minister of the assembly, when he was converted, was told to go into the city to be told what he should do.<a name=505:7></a> And the Lord sends the two disciples into the city.<a name=505:8></a> He says, "Go into the city, and a man shall meet you carrying a pitcher of water".<a name=505:9></a> Carrying is a levitical thought, one great feature of levitical service is to carry things.<a name=505:10></a> It is not simply that the man had the pitcher of water, but he carried it.<a name=505:11></a> And what enters into the mind at this point is that the Lord brings in the objective idea.<a name=505:12></a> He diverts us from ourselves, for in regard to these matters, we have to learn, as I might say, objectively.<a name=505:13></a> Many are prone to look in on themselves in regard to the things of God, especially the breaking of bread, and think things are not just right or fit.<a name=505:14></a> It is right to examine ourselves, but not to be self-occupied, and for this we must turn our eyes out on <i>another</i> -- here a man carrying a pitcher of water.<a name=505:15></a> He has a burden -- spiritually something of great value, that is the idea.<a name=505:16></a> Why is he carrying this burden?<a name=505:17></a> I suppose we may see a full example of this in the apostle Paul's ministry at any time as he moved in his wide field, he was carrying things; he was a man who bore burdens -- always carrying a pitcher of water.<a name=505:18></a> The supreme example of this burden-bearing is Christ Himself, I need not say.<a name=505:19></a> As to everything, the great objective thought is seen in Him.<a name=505:20></a> What goes on in us is according to this.<a name=505:21></a> As we

		So that we may see what the preparation means, the passage says, "as they lay at table and were eating" -- this is an eating scene, Mark presents that side.<a name=507:4></a> Mark says nothing about the memorial in the Lord's supper, but refers to the eating of it, that is, the Lord is <i>providing</i> for us; if we have Him in our minds and would have things right for Him, He supports us so that that may go on; there is food.<a name=507:5></a> Moreover, the need of food is important if there is to be any heart-searching, and that is one of the things that comes in in the initial stages of divine services, because the word is, "Is thy heart right, as my heart is with thy heart?<a name=507:6></a>" (<a href="../bible/2Kings.htm#10:15">2 Kings  10:15</a>).<a name=507:7></a> That is, as it were, what the Lord would say, as Jehu said to Jehonadab in <a href="../bible/2Kings.htm#10:15">2 Kings  10:15</a>.<a name=507:8></a> The Lord here says, "One of you .<a name=507:9></a>.<a name=507:10></a>.<a name=507:11></a>" It was as they were eating.<a name=507:12></a> He considers them, for if He is to get results, there must be food, and that always applies; in cases of restoration, or in dealing with sin, it is important that there should be food.<a name=507:13></a> And hence, "One of you .<a name=507:14></a>.<a name=507:15></a>.<a name=507:16></a>" and then, "Is it I?<a name=507:17></a>" He is dealing here with sin in someone -- and the need of that is frequent, alas!<a name=507:18></a> I only refer to it so that ample room may be made for the Lord in such matters.<a name=507:19></a> We must not restrict Him in ourselves, because His operations in the assembly are all in the minds and hearts of the saints; what the Lord is doing He is doing there, what the Spirit is doing.<a name=507:20></a> He is doing there; and we effectually limit all this if our minds are wrong, if we have wrong thoughts.<a name=507:21></a> So the Lord leads in this matter and makes it plain, without being too personal, where the betrayer is.<a name=507:22></a> It is an important matter to have things disclosed, so that we understand.<a name=507:23></a> You may say, 'This is not an assembly meeting'.<a name=507:24></a> It is the light that governs the precincts of it, as I may say.<a name=507:25></a> It is important

		So here the evil one is disclosed, and then the Lord goes on to what He had in mind; the preparation was there, the room was also there, furnished and prepared.<a name=508:3></a> All that refers <i>now</i> to the state of our souls in view of the assembly, on those lines we become ready.<a name=508:4></a> I mean, the furnishing here refers really to the state of the saints.<a name=508:5></a> The Master says that it is His guest-chamber -- "Where is my guest-chamber?<a name=508:6></a>" It is a question of His rights in our hearts and whether things are suitable to Him there.<a name=508:7></a> So that, as the right state is there, although there may be one person out of accord, the general position is clear, and the Lord proceeds to do what He had in mind.<a name=508:8></a> It was the passover, but the Lord's supper was in prospect; that is to say, love proceeding beyond anything that ever had entered into the passover feast before.<a name=508:9></a> It was love going on to the best, that is the testimony to Christ's love, "Take this; this is my body".<a name=508:10></a> And the cup too, "This is my blood, that of the new covenant, that shed for many".<a name=508:11></a> "And they all drank out of it", the passage says.<a name=508:12></a> The Lord had dealt with whatever evil there was; whatever needed to be adjusted, He adjusted it; and now He proceeds with what is uppermost in His heart, for it is a question of the disciples, of <i>His own</i>, and He opens up to them the thought of the new covenant, and leads up to a mutual state of things.<a name=508:13></a>

		The celebration in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#19">Revelation  19</a>is a very great one; after the destruction of the false thing, Babylon, in chapter 18, the celebration in heaven is wonderful, and it works out to this, "the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready".<a name=509:17></a> It is what the saints do in relation to Christ in view of the great occasion that is now imminent, thank God -- the marriage of the Lamb: she has made herself ready.<a name=509:18></a> "And

		Then I want to add to all that, something from 2 Corinthians.<a name=510:5></a> The chapter read deals with the question of giving, but I am not speaking of that by itself; what I am speaking about is this matter of preparedness, for without the preparedness for giving, the giving is nothing.<a name=510:6></a> What does God care about dollars or pounds?<a name=510:7></a> He cares nothing about them in themselves.<a name=510:8></a> A man might dole out, we are told, all his goods for the poor, without love, and what does God care about that?<a name=510:9></a> -- he is <i>nothing</i>, that is what Scripture says, I am speaking of this matter of preparedness.<a name=510:10></a> The apostle is stressing in these two chapters -- 8 and 9 -- that it is a question of the giver, the gift, of course, from such a giver, but the point is the giver, whether he is prepared, whether I am <i>prepared</i> to use the box, as we speak of it, or to give in any sense.<a name=510:11></a> I have to be prepared for that as much as to propose a hymn to be sung or to give thanks to God.<a name=510:12></a> It is a spiritual matter.<a name=510:13></a> God is dealing with <i>persons</i>.<a name=510:14></a> The mere material thing by itself is nothing to God; the cattle on a thousand hills are His.<a name=510:15></a>

		God is thinking of the persons who give and of those who serve Him.<a name=511:1></a> He is seeking worshippers who worship in the true sense, and givers who give in the true sense.<a name=511:2></a> Paul speaks to the Corinthians in chapter 8 about the Macedonians; he had a way of bringing forward the work of God in other saints to stimulate those he is dealing with, and here he speaks about the Macedonians.<a name=511:3></a> This they did, he says, "not according as we hoped, but they gave themselves first to the Lord, and to us by God's will" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#8:5">2 Corinthians  8:5</a>).<a name=511:4></a> "By God's will" -- how entirely under God they were in this!<a name=511:5></a> These chapters would help us as to whatever we have to give, little or much, that it should be in the spirit of divine giving.<a name=511:6></a> "God loveth a cheerful giver", not his gift exactly, but the person, it is a question of his state, the spirit and manner of his giving.<a name=511:7></a> And so the apostle stresses that the Macedonians were ready; he tells the Corinthians how ready they were, and now he tells the Corinthians, according to these verses, that he had boasted of them to others also.<a name=511:8></a> He had a remarkable way of using the work of God in one place to stimulate it in another place.<a name=511:9></a> Why not?<a name=511:10></a> It is one thing.<a name=511:11></a> He says, 'I have boasted of you, that you were ready a year ago'.<a name=511:12></a> How remarkable this is!<a name=511:13></a> He kept it in mind that they were ready in this matter a year before.<a name=511:14></a> How extended the thing was!<a name=511:15></a> But the exercise, the preparation, was all pleasing to heaven.<a name=511:16></a> The apostle was labouring to prepare the saints for this matter of giving.<a name=511:17></a> Of course he laboured to prepare them for other matters, the Lord's supper was a great thing with him, but he says now, "On the first of the week let each of you put by at home, laying up in whatever degree he may have prospered, that there may be no collections when I come" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#16:2">1 Corinthians  16:2</a>).<a name=511:18></a> He said, as it were, I want you to do it of your own selves so that it is your doing, not for my eyes or ears, but for God, and do it on the first day of the week -- if a <i>day</i> will affect you, that ought to.<a name=511:19></a> And do it at <i>home</i> he is not dealing with the collection for local needs, but to

	<div class="paragraph">
		God is bringing us round to this, and what can be greater?<a name=512:3></a> So he reminds the Corinthians that he had boasted about them that they were prepared a year before; but he was afraid there had been a lapse; and there often is -- there are those who decide to give, but they change their minds.<a name=512:4></a> How sorrowful that is!<a name=512:5></a> The apostle was afraid of that, and he does not want to be ashamed.<a name=512:6></a> Of course <i>they</i> should be ashamed, but he says, 'I am so identified with you that if you have cause to be ashamed, I am ashamed'.<a name=512:7></a> He had a peculiar way of telling everybody about the Corinthians, so he says, I shall be ashamed that you are not ready.<a name=512:8></a> He says, "I thought it necessary therefore to beg the brethren that they would come to you, and complete beforehand your fore-announced blessing, that this may be ready thus as blessing, and not as got out of you.<a name=512:9></a> But this is true, he that sows sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he that sows in the spirit of blessing shall reap also in blessing: each according as he is purposed in his heart; not grievingly, or of necessity; for God loves a cheerful giver".<a name=512:10></a> It is the state of a man, that he is becoming like God, and has purposed in his heart on those lines.<a name=512:11></a> This is going to be a matter of the glory of Christ, that is what the apostle has in mind.<a name=512:12></a> He says, I am ready to serve in it with others who are Christ's glory, ministers of the assembly, but it is a question, not of what they carried, but of what it represents, the preparedness of the brethren in this great matter.<a name=512:13></a> So you will understand I am not speaking of the material thing in itself, but of what the saints are, which is a great thing.<a name=512:14></a> So putting into the box requires preparedness as in the affections; it is a question of what I am, so the apostle says earlier that a man is

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is one thought left; it is in the verse read in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#8">Revelation  8</a>.<a name=513:2></a> And now, dear brethren, I want to say a word to those who are serving in a special way.<a name=513:3></a> Of course all the saints are to serve, but a word now is needed in regard to those of us who serve in a specific way, as to the importance of preparation -- not of the subject-matter, but of the persons who serve.<a name=513:4></a> So the word here is, "the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves that they might sound with their trumpets".<a name=513:5></a> "Prepared themselves" -- notice that.<a name=513:6></a> Now you see that, in all these cases, it is mainly a question of the persons and what God has in the persons.<a name=513:7></a> If God has not something in what I am doing now, what is it?<a name=513:8></a> You may say.<a name=513:9></a> 'It may help others'; but God must have something in it; He is thinking of the persons <i>in their service</i>.<a name=513:10></a> It is not to prepare the subject but to prepare myself -- that is the word.<a name=513:11></a> The seven angels had the ability -- I mean the trumpets, which I suppose I might say represent gift -- and power to sound; but that is not enough.<a name=513:12></a> No doubt they could make the sound of the trumpet; the apostle deals with that in speaking of ministry in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14">1 Corinthians  14</a>; there must be distinct sounds; it is not simply that I have a trumpet that can be used, but the person using it is to be suitable.<a name=513:13></a> It says, the seven angels <i>prepared themselves</i> that they might sound the trumpets.<a name=513:14></a> The gift one may have is not all.<a name=513:15></a> In Ephesians the man himself is the gift, but in Corinthians it is power given from God to be used in service.<a name=513:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So, dear brethren, God, I believe, has in mind that in assembly service, domestic service, business service, in walking on the street, in riding in the train or in motor cars, we are to be pleasing to Him.<a name=513:17></a> God is to have pleasure in us all the time; but particularly in our preparation for service.<a name=513:18></a> A brother humbly gets to the Lord -- according to Proverbs we are to watch at His

		So you will readily see that the idea of preparation enters into the things of which I have spoken.<a name=514:6></a> It is a question of what is needed in every case, so that we might be equal to each service and that God has His part in it.<a name=514:7></a> The vessel is to be dignified by the anointing, so that something might be said by those who hear, as was said of the Lord Jesus: they "wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4:22">Luke  4:22</a>).<a name=514:8></a> "The eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4:20">Luke  4:20</a>) -- it was a question of the Person, of the Minister, what He was.<a name=514:9></a> The words were beautiful, but the Person was attractive; He was there in all His grace as the Minister on that occasion.<a name=514:10></a>

		What is in mind to speak of is of a military character, hoping that it will carry with it what edifies and nourishes as the word of God.<a name=534:1></a> First, as to the obligation resting upon us to have part in the military feature of the service of God.<a name=534:2></a> It will be remembered that in the type in Numbers all the males from twenty years old and upward, those that were able to go forth to war, were enrolled.<a name=534:3></a> It will also be remembered that it is remarked in the book of Judges, after the great series of battles ending in the people of God entering on their heritage, that some had not known the wars of Canaan; and so it is, that there are those constantly coming in amongst the saints who do not know war and need to learn it.<a name=534:4></a> It is not an optional matter, it is imperative, for conscription is the principle with God in this respect; and we are to understand what it is that is to be contended for, involving, as Jude says, "the faith once delivered to the saints" (<a href="../bible/Jude.htm#1:3">Jude  1:3</a>).<a name=534:5></a> What is of God was never delivered to others; not to self-made councils and ecclesiastical dignitaries as historically known, but to the saints.<a name=534:6></a> So the idea is that the saints are in possession of it and are to value what they have, "the good deposit", and maintain it against all opposition; and that in this service they are to be pleasing to the Lord, as we learn in this fourth verse, "No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier".<a name=534:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In certain services we may perhaps assume that we are pleasing to the Lord; it is imperative that we should be in every service, but as in military service we are apt to forget that it is imperative there also.<a name=534:8></a> The idea of being pleasing to God is outstanding from the days of Enoch and earlier.<a name=534:9></a> Indeed, as God made one

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then what comes out at this point is that soldiership is learnt from God, so that we are to understand it is a spiritual matter.<a name=535:6></a> Hence the saints, as come out of Egypt, celebrated Jehovah as a "man of war" -- "Jehovah is a man of war", they say (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15:3">Exodus  15:3</a>); but then, in the same breath they say, "Jehovah, his name".<a name=535:7></a> There was more there than warriorship and military power; "Jehovah, his name", a name that is regarded by the spiritual as to be revered.<a name=535:8></a> So that the thought leads to worship.<a name=535:9></a> That chapter -- <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15">Exodus  15</a>-- is full of the spirit of worship, including the triumphant note, "Jehovah shall reign for ever and ever!<a name=535:10></a>" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15:18">Exodus  15:18</a>) No thoroughly subject person desires aught else than that, than that "Jehovah shall reign for ever and ever",(<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15:18">Exodus  15:18</a>) a settled order of things in which the subjects are satisfied.<a name=535:11></a>

		Another thing that comes in is that, in our warfare, we go through a certain training, so that the Lord can take His place as Head, as Leader, and not be ashamed of us -- because we please Him.<a name=535:12></a> Hence in the book of Joshua we have five chapters dealing with the education of Joshua and Israel; particularly their army, but Israel as a whole, before we have the Captain of Jehovah's

		Immediately after this heavenly bread is spoken of, Joshua lifts up his eyes and sees the Man with His sword drawn.<a name=536:8></a> Joshua, being the ostensible leader of Israel, thinks of someone as an addition to his army, to his military power, and inquires, "Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?<a name=536:9></a>" (<a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#5:13">Joshua  5:13</a>) The reply was, "Nay; but as captain of the host of the Lord am I now come",(<a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#5:14">Joshua  5:14</a>) as much as to say, as indeed the footnote indicates, 'for I, the captain of the army of Jehovah, am now come' -- the time has come for it, conditions are ready for it.<a name=536:10></a> That is, I think, what is meant.<a name=536:11></a> It is a military matter, and the Captain is there; He belongs to heaven, and when suitable conditions exist.<a name=536:12></a> He comes in to lead.<a name=536:13></a> 'I as Captain of Jehovah's host am now come'.<a name=536:14></a> I know of nothing more encouraging in times of stress, of

		God could have given deliverance otherwise, but He said in effect to Gideon, 'You are to go down to the camp and see this thing I have put there, and you will be assured that victory is yours'.<a name=542:3></a> So it says, "Gideon came, and behold, a man was telling a dream to his fellow; and he said.<a name=542:4></a> Behold, I dreamed a dream, and lo, a cake of barley-bread tumbled into the camp of Midian, and came to the tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it; and the tent lay along".<a name=542:5></a> There was only one Rahab; only one wife of Pilate; only one thief on the cross who was converted; only one centurion at the cross who confessed Jesus; here there were two men in Midian's camp speaking of the victory over their own people that God was about to give Gideon.<a name=542:6></a> I want you to note that Jehovah directed His servant to go down into Midian's camp to see what was there.<a name=542:7></a>

		In the New Testament we may find examples of this kind in the teaching, how the weakness of the world is exposed.<a name=542:8></a> You get, for instance, in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#9">Revelation  9</a>, apparently great warriors, but they have hair as woman's hair; meaning that they are morally weak; and so we are told to resist the devil, and he will flee from us.<a name=542:9></a> With all his show of outward power, he is a defeated foe, and cannot stand before true Christians, being the soldiers of God.<a name=542:10></a> The Christian knows the arch-enemy, he understands by spiritual teaching the weakness that is there.<a name=542:11></a> We all are to understand it, what we have to contend with, and how weak the position is, if rightly understood.<a name=542:12></a> Scripture abounds with evidence of this.<a name=542:13></a> Gideon is to know it in a first-hand way.<a name=542:14></a> So Jehovah says, "Go thou with Phurah thy servant" (<a href="../bible/Judges.htm#7:10">Judges  7:10</a>).<a name=542:15></a> Two are better than one in such matters.<a name=542:16></a> Two spies went to Jericho, and here there are Gideon and his servant, and then two men in the camp of Midian.<a name=542:17></a> One has
