		These scriptures speak of measure, in the first place as regards Christ, and then as regards the assembly, the measure of which corresponds to Christ.<a name=1:3></a> The question of measure is first seen in connection with material things.<a name=1:4></a> The whole creation was formed according to divine measure and weight, but in these scriptures we find that measure is applied to persons.<a name=1:5></a> We may say in truth that all men come under divine measuring.<a name=1:6></a> In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3">Romans  3</a>it says: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God".<a name=1:7></a> God has in Christ brought in a standard, and all are measured according to this, and, according to their natural condition, all come short before this standard.<a name=1:8></a> In spite of this, God has determined to bring men into correspondence with this standard (see <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:13">Ephesians  4:13</a>).<a name=1:9></a> It is to this end that Christ, since He has gone up on high, has given gifts.<a name=1:10></a> "And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ".<a name=1:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We see thus that God has before Him a perfect or full-grown man; that is to say, a man who corresponds to His thoughts.<a name=1:12></a> It could never be said about Adam that he was full-grown, for there is nothing said about his growing.<a name=1:13></a> He was evidently created perfect, so that we have no thought of growth in Adam.<a name=1:14></a> Nor could we in a moral sense

		speak of growth or development in Christ.<a name=2:1></a> In His Person, as represented here in testimony, He sets forth for us in a perfect way what man ought to be before God.<a name=2:2></a> The four gospels give us a fourfold and perfect presentation of Christ, and the epistles have in view to bring <i>us</i> to the same measure, so that growth has to do with <i>our</i> side.<a name=2:3></a> Therefore we find stressed in the epistles the need of growth.<a name=2:4></a> In <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2">1 Peter  2</a>we are exhorted to desire earnestly the sincere milk of the word that we may grow.<a name=2:5></a> Like new-born babes we should be desirous of it, so that we by it might grow unto salvation.<a name=2:6></a> In all the epistles great stress is laid on the need of growth, and this is evidently because we commence as little children.<a name=2:7></a> We begin thus and grow up into manhood, and for this we need the service of the gifts, so that we together should reach the same measure of stature.<a name=2:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There ought in a spiritual sense be none undeveloped among the children of God.<a name=2:9></a> Christ as ascended into heaven has in view a perfect presentation of Himself in the saints as a whole.<a name=2:10></a> Therefore it says: "Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ".<a name=2:11></a> And in the same epistle it says that the assembly is the fulness of Christ, which we see coming out in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21">Revelation  21</a>.<a name=2:12></a> It is no shame to be a little child to start with, since one has been born; that is to say, after our conversion, but it is a shame to be as little children when we have been converted a year.<a name=2:13></a> The secret of so much uncertainty and lack of satisfaction among the people of God is owing to the lack of growth.<a name=2:14></a>

		When Abraham desired to get certainty regarding the fulfilment of the promises, God told him to present an offering, a heifer of three years old, and a she-goat of three years old, and a ram of three years

		old.<a name=3:1></a> He gave him to understand that if he desired to enjoy certainty, it was of moment to increase in growth.<a name=3:2></a> That these animals should be three years old implies that they were full-grown.<a name=3:3></a> This does not give the idea of a childish state in the believer.<a name=3:4></a> If we do not desire the sincere milk of the word, we shall remain little children.<a name=3:5></a> The Corinthians were babes and thus exposed to influences in this world; they were not in possession of the joy of salvation, because they had not grown to it.<a name=3:6></a> It says of some in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#5">Hebrews  5</a>that they were babes, when for the time they ought to be teachers.<a name=3:7></a> I believe, dear brethren, that if we should take up this question in earnest, each one of us should say of himself, 'I have been a babe for a long time; it is high time for me to be able to present a lamb of a year old'.<a name=3:8></a> We read of a day of extreme weakness in Israel when Samuel sacrificed a sucking lamb.<a name=3:9></a> This indicated an acknowledgement before God that the people were just like sucking children.<a name=3:10></a> What is there in babes that can defend and promote the testimony?<a name=3:11></a> What is there in such to save us from the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive, as it says in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4">Ephesians  4</a>?<a name=3:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The passover lamb was to be a year old, not a sucking lamb.<a name=3:13></a> This gives us the thought that when the Israelite left Egypt, or in other words, when a believer leaves the world behind him, he has grown somewhat.<a name=3:14></a> We ought to ask ourselves how much we have grown since we were converted.<a name=3:15></a> One has seen believers who have been converted twenty years, and who have not reached further in their souls than to a condition characterised by babyhood.<a name=3:16></a> We remember how Hannah every year when she went up to worship, brought with her a little coat for the boy Samuel.<a name=3:17></a> As the child grew he needed a larger coat.<a name=3:18></a> In a similar way as I draw near to God my sacrifice will be greater; that is to say, two or three

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now let us look at <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12">Romans  12</a>.<a name=4:3></a> The epistle to the Romans is an epistle for the little children.<a name=4:4></a> I do not mean that any of us could ever do without this epistle, but that it contains what the little children are in need of.<a name=4:5></a> It was written by the apostle through divine inspiration to instruct believers in the truth of the gospel.<a name=4:6></a> We sometimes think that the gospel is for the unconverted only.<a name=4:7></a> It is for the unconverted surely, but Romans was not written for them, but for believers.<a name=4:8></a> It was written to the saints in Rome, who were hardly more than little children, and to the end that they might be instructed in the fundamental principles of the gospel, in order that they should be no more babes, but should grow up to Christ "from whom the whole body, fitted together, and connected by every joint of supply .<a name=4:9></a>.<a name=4:10></a>.<a name=4:11></a> works for itself the increase of the body to its self-building up in love".<a name=4:12></a> The apostle desired that the saints in Rome should grow in the truth of the assembly, and that is why he wrote this wonderful epistle.<a name=4:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		According to the gospel of Mark we see how the Lord Jesus in His first preaching said, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel".<a name=4:14></a> I am to believe first, and then I discover how much there is found in it.<a name=4:15></a> When we receive the gospel it is as if we received the promise of an inheritance.<a name=4:16></a> Romans shows me how rich the inheritance is.<a name=4:17></a> Now we can understand what the Lord meant when He said, "Believe the gospel".<a name=4:18></a> I say that I believe it, but I wish to know all that it implies, what riches are found in it.<a name=4:19></a> I freely admit that little children are very lovable; we see in them a freshness of life, as

	<div class="paragraph">
		is evident in the Thessalonians when Paul wrote to them.<a name=5:1></a> While we all will admit that such young believers are lovable, we do not wish them to remain undeveloped.<a name=5:2></a> In a family undeveloped children are a cause of sorrow and anxiety; it is the same in the family of God, and those who have stopped growing are a cause of sorrow to God, and anxiety to His people.<a name=5:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In order to grow, we need the sincere milk of the word, and fresh air; that is, the atmosphere that is found among the people of God, where the Spirit of God is at liberty.<a name=5:4></a> I also need light.<a name=5:5></a> These things come out in Romans.<a name=5:6></a> Beside other things we find in Romans the thought of measure.<a name=5:7></a> "For .<a name=5:8></a>.<a name=5:9></a>.<a name=5:10></a> through the grace given unto me, .<a name=5:11></a>.<a name=5:12></a>.<a name=5:13></a> as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12:3">Romans  12:3</a>.<a name=5:14></a> Although Christ is the subject of the gospel, we find in these scriptures that I begin to look at myself.<a name=5:15></a> I have listened to the gospel, but the question is, Have I grown in my soul?<a name=5:16></a> Have we ever measured ourselves with Christ?<a name=5:17></a> The gospel presents Christ to me.<a name=5:18></a> It is God's glad tidings about His Son.<a name=5:19></a> I have listened to the gospel, but have I grown in my soul?<a name=5:20></a> I am perhaps familiar with the truth of the gospel and its mode of expression, but it may be only an outward knowledge, in the same way as one knows history.<a name=5:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are those who study the Bible in the same way as they study history.<a name=5:22></a> At the universities this study is considered as a science, but such a study is not the means by which we grow in our souls.<a name=5:23></a> Christ is the measure of the soul's growth, and when I look at Christ, this involves much more than a mere knowledge of the doctrine.<a name=5:24></a> I am thinking of all the precious moral features that shine forth in Christ as He is presented in the four gospels.<a name=5:25></a> The meaning here is that when I think of myself I ought to think soberly and be wise, as God has dealt to me the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not a question of being converted on such and such a day, or that you go to the meetings regularly, but I ask, What is your measure of faith?<a name=6:4></a> God gives each one a measure.<a name=6:5></a> Have you had to do with God in order to get this measure of faith?<a name=6:6></a> In the same way as when God created all things according to measure, He even now works in our souls according to measure; it is therefore important that I should ask myself, Have I received this measure of faith?<a name=6:7></a> In Matthew's gospel the Lord speaks of a <i>little faith</i> and of a <i>great faith</i>, and even of those who had no faith at all.<a name=6:8></a> "Without faith it is impossible to please him".<a name=6:9></a> We do not wish to be characterised as those who have little faith, but we ought to desire faith which is according to the divine measure for us.<a name=6:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We have a scripture in Exodus which is of help for us in this.<a name=6:11></a> We read of the measure of manna that every Israelite gathered daily (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#16:18">Exodus  16:18</a>).<a name=6:12></a> This is very practical, for the measure of what a man eats in a spiritual sense shows in a significant way what his or her growth is.<a name=6:13></a> God has dealt to each the measure of faith, and He deals the measure for us to eat.<a name=6:14></a> He has a measurement for us each one, and I believe that the measure of faith in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12">Romans  12</a>corresponds to the measure of manna that each one was to eat according to Exodus, the measure of what I can eat, what I can digest.<a name=6:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#10">2 Corinthians  10</a>we see that the Corinthians were not characterised by this divine measure, for it says they were "measuring themselves by themselves"; we can understand how far they had departed from the divine principles which are given to us in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12">Romans  12</a>.<a name=6:16></a> If I measure myself with my

		brethren or they compare themselves with me, we all have a wrong measure, and this is what they did at Corinth.<a name=7:1></a> It was as if a brother should say, 'I know just as much as this brother, or I can speak better than he'.<a name=7:2></a> We can understand how such measuring only gives cause for jealousy and degrades the people of God to the level of the world, for that is what they do in the world, they measure themselves by themselves.<a name=7:3></a> Now the apostle had a measure, he shows how he served according to the measure God had given to him; he served "according to the measure of the rule which the God of measure has apportioned to us", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#10:13">2 Corinthians  10:13</a>.<a name=7:4></a>

		The last scripture we read from Revelation shows us how God reaches the end which is set before us in Ephesians.<a name=7:5></a> We find here that the reed was of gold; the measurement is wholly divine.<a name=7:6></a> God reaches here the result of the work which He has carried out during all these centuries.<a name=7:7></a> The reed was for measuring the city and its gates and wall.<a name=7:8></a> John goes on to say that "the city lies four-square, and its length is as much as the breadth".<a name=7:9></a> Looked upon from this point of view it was a quadrangle.<a name=7:10></a> That is to say, a measure which has length and breadth.<a name=7:11></a> So that from this point of view the city represents God in the universal attitude which He has taken up towards all men.<a name=7:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		First of all the city is four-square; this is like the sheet that descended unto Peter and was knit at its four corners, indicating that the gospel is for all men, a thing that is true even of the assembly at this time.<a name=7:13></a> We ought in our minds to correspond to this measure which has length and breadth, the square measure.<a name=7:14></a> I believe God will help us to think of all men in an evangelical way and with compassion.<a name=7:15></a> We have length and breadth; this is the square measure.<a name=7:16></a> After having spoken of the length and breadth of the city, he now speaks of its height.<a name=7:17></a> We

		These passages present to us the idea of a model or pattern.<a name=9:1></a> In moral things God works on the principle of a model or pattern.<a name=9:2></a> We cannot say that He worked on the principle of a model primarily in the physical creation, although He necessarily had a plan in His own mind.<a name=9:3></a> The word in Proverbs would indicate that He was the Artificer or Architect of the universe, and as the foundation was laid, the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy, so that evidently what was in the mind of God was understood by intelligent beings even then.<a name=9:4></a> Then in accordance with this, it is said, "Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:3">Hebrews  11:3</a>), and further it is said, "He spake, and it was done" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#33:9">Psalm  33:9</a>); that is, His mind entered into it; all was done in divine wisdom.<a name=9:5></a>

		Simon and Andrew are casting out their nets in the sea, and as they do, so the Lord says: "Come after me, and I will make you become fishers of men".<a name=23:11></a> We find at the beginning of Mark's gospel that the thought of the sea connects itself with the fishing for men in all the wide world.<a name=23:12></a> It is no question of Jews, Greeks or Romans, but of men.<a name=23:13></a> And the sea reminds us that we must not be limited.<a name=23:14></a> God is not limited through the sea to any special nation.<a name=23:15></a> He has scattered men over the whole surface of the earth, and for that reason this fishing for men continues.<a name=23:16></a>

		My thought, beloved brethren, is to speak of moral elevation.<a name=52:1></a> The thought of elevation, whether we look at it as moral or literal, has a special application in christianity.<a name=52:2></a> The literal side we find specially in the gospel of Luke, and this corresponds to the epistle to Ephesians.<a name=52:3></a> In a coming day there will be found a people of God that has its blessing on earth, but our blessing is in the heavenlies.<a name=52:4></a> It says in Ephesians that "God .<a name=52:5></a>.<a name=52:6></a>.<a name=52:7></a> has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ", and in connection with this it says that He has "raised us up together, and has made us sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus".<a name=52:8></a> It was in the purpose of God to set us in the heavenlies.<a name=52:9></a> Nothing in Scripture is plainer than this, that our calling is a heavenly one.<a name=52:10></a> As the apostle says in <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3:14">Philippians  3:14</a>: "The calling on high of God in Christ Jesus".<a name=52:11></a> That is why, as I said, the gospel of Luke develops step by step the great principle of elevation.<a name=52:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, this principle of introduction appears in all the evangelists, but particularly in Matthew, in Luke and in John.<a name=61:4></a> In Matthew it is through the star in the East; in Luke it is by an angel; in John it is by John the baptist.<a name=61:5></a> You will all remember how John the baptist looking on Jesus as He walked said, "Behold the Lamb of God".<a name=61:6></a> You see, John knew Him; he had been directed how to locate the Person of the Lord Jesus.<a name=61:7></a> The word was, "Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, he it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit".<a name=61:8></a> Now John saw that, and thus he knew the Person.<a name=61:9></a> But he did not keep silent about it; he immediately adds, "I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God".<a name=61:10></a> Two of John's disciples heard this and followed Jesus; they heard John say, "Behold the Lamb of God".<a name=61:11></a>

		Now this was when Jesus was entering on His ministry but Matthew and Luke record introduction to Jesus when He was a Babe and I believe the Lord would have a word for us as to these two introductions.<a name=61:12></a> The first record speaks of wise men from the East, but Luke speaks of shepherds.<a name=61:13></a> That is, we have in Matthew persons of distinction in this world -- those who belong to what we call the educated class.<a name=61:14></a> Luke, on the other hand speaks of persons of no special distinction in the world; they are just shepherds.<a name=61:15></a> I mention this so that we may

		The eunuch on his way from Jerusalem to his country was reading the Old Testament, but it does not suffice to read, we need to understand also.<a name=98:8></a> There was one who had the Holy Spirit, and who was led by Him to follow the eunuch's chariot; as getting alongside of the eunuch, he asked him if he understood what he was reading, to which he replied, "How should I then be able unless some one guide me?<a name=98:9></a> And he begged Philip to come up and sit with him".<a name=98:10></a> We know that the Holy Spirit has now come here, a Person who can explain the Old Testament to us.<a name=98:11></a> It says in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24">Luke  24</a>that the Lord interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.<a name=98:12></a> It was by the Holy Spirit's guidance and by His help that Philip beginning from that scripture announced the glad tidings of Jesus to the eunuch.<a name=98:13></a> It is obvious that he was not limited to this scripture; nor was the Lord limited to only one scripture when he interpreted the Old Testament to His disciples.<a name=98:14></a> He began from Moses and from all the prophets and

		Now to come to our subject we find in Joseph a type of the personal feelings of the Lord Jesus.<a name=99:6></a> Joseph's brethren spoke to one another in his presence of the anguish of soul they had seen in him when they lifted him out of the pit and sold him to the Midianites.<a name=99:7></a> We read how Joseph turned away from them and wept when they said this.<a name=99:8></a> In this Joseph is a type of Christ, for He felt deeply that His brethren, the Jews, rejected him.<a name=99:9></a> We find even when Benjamin came to Joseph in Egypt that he went into the chamber to weep there when he saw him.<a name=99:10></a> This shows what a great love he had for his brother.<a name=99:11></a> These tears speak of deep love to a brother.<a name=99:12></a> We see here in a type the Lord's joy in His people, and in each one of us as those who are His brethren.<a name=99:13></a> Then again we find in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#45">Genesis  45</a>how Joseph expressed his feelings when he made himself known to his brethren, and how he wept aloud so that the Egyptians and Pharaoh's servants heard it.<a name=99:14></a> It says that he fell on his brother Benjamin's neck and wept, and that he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them.<a name=99:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As regards David we see how he also strengthened himself in the Lord his God, and all that seemed lost was recovered.<a name=101:3></a> David was now a greater servant than he was before the event at Ziklag.<a name=101:4></a> He was to be prepared for other experiences; every testing was necessary for the presentation of the testimony of God.<a name=101:5></a> Everything that happens to us, great or small, is calculated to make us sober and humble, so that we feel all these things in fellowship with God.<a name=101:6></a> The result is that we can represent Him in relation to the testimony of the gospel and "encourage those who are in any tribulation whatever, through the encouragement with which we ourselves are encouraged of God".<a name=101:7></a>

		We see from what I have said that there are numerous scriptures in the Old Testament that speak of the feelings of Christ, especially in the Psalms of David.<a name=102:5></a> The Lamentations even are an expression of this.<a name=102:6></a> We find in the book of Ezra, when the foundation of the temple was being laid, that the ancient men who remembered the first temple wept, but the younger ones shouted for joy, so that one could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people.<a name=102:7></a> We should even in our day, if we have God's interests before us, feel the great difference between this time and the day of Pentecost.<a name=102:8></a> We should feel how very much smaller and weaker everything is than in the days of the apostles, but at the same time we should find our joy in all that which is of God at the present time; in other words, our hearts are not insensible, but we feel things and find our joy in what God works now.<a name=102:9></a>

		Now I wish to speak of the two scriptures in John and Luke.<a name=102:10></a> The Lord Jesus says, "Now is my soul troubled".<a name=102:11></a> We see what a real man He was both as to spirit, soul and body, as we say.<a name=102:12></a> He was troubled in His soul when He thought of the death He was about to die, for He was on His way to death.<a name=102:13></a> No one could take His life from Him.<a name=102:14></a> He said: "I lay it down of myself".<a name=102:15></a> And He took it again according to the commandment He had received from His Father.<a name=102:16></a> But He was going to die, and He knew what death was, for as a divine Person He knew perfectly what the work of atonement involved.<a name=102:17></a> Therefore He says, "Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say?<a name=102:18></a>".<a name=102:19></a> If any great calamity was going to happen to me, and my soul was deeply distressed at it, what should I say?<a name=102:20></a> I should pray God to deliver me out

		THE BLESSING OF A BELIEVER'S HOUSE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#16:7">Genesis  16:7</a> - 9, 13, 14; <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#21:14">Genesis  21:14</a> - 21
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I suggested these two scriptures for two reasons; first because in them we have the idea of a well or spring, and secondly because they speak of two persons who belong to a believer's house, and whom God sought to bless because they belonged to a believer's house.<a name=120:1></a> The idea of a well, it may be remarked, has a very great place in Scripture.<a name=120:2></a> It is found frequently in this book and throughout other books of scripture whether in the Old or New Testament, and suggests what is living as meeting man's need.<a name=120:3></a> It may therefore be regarded as typical of the system of grace which God has established in Christ, which system involves not only doctrine and light, but what is living.<a name=120:4></a> The Holy Spirit came down from heaven as sent down by the Lord Jesus Christ as exalted up there; it is therefore a living system of things.<a name=120:5></a>

		The apostle Peter in his first great gospel address alludes to it.<a name=120:6></a> The Holy Spirit was present at Pentecost in Jerusalem, and men and women were possessed of Him.<a name=120:7></a> And they were supremely happy, so much so that the unregenerate around thought they were full of new wine, but Peter explains that they were not filled with new wine as was supposed, but that a wonderful power had come down from Christ in heaven and had taken possession of them, so that he says, referring to Christ, that "being by the right hand of God exalted .<a name=120:8></a>.<a name=120:9></a>.<a name=120:10></a> he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear".<a name=120:11></a> It was there, you see; it was obviously there, and thousands of his hearers said to him and to the others standing by him, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?<a name=120:12></a>".<a name=120:13></a> His answer was, "Repent, and be baptised, each one of you .<a name=120:14></a>.<a name=120:15></a>.<a name=120:16></a> for remission of sins, and ye will receive the gift of

	<div class="paragraph">
		the Holy Spirit".<a name=121:1></a> Then he adds, The promise is unto you and unto your children.<a name=121:2></a> This wonderful gift from God was there and was available to believers.<a name=121:3></a> It was, as I said, symbolised by a spring or well, that which springs up, which refreshes and satisfies, which indeed, as the Lord said Himself, shall be "a fountain of water, springing up into eternal life".<a name=121:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This symbol is found in the two scriptures read, and it is found for the first time in these.<a name=121:5></a> Water is spoken of earlier; we have it in oceans, in seas, in lakes, and in rivers, and in each of these divisions of water God has been thinking of men.<a name=121:6></a> But a well is a peculiar provision, as if God would think not only of the masses of men, but of every single person in the world.<a name=121:7></a> An ocean may serve millions of people at once, but a well suggests provision made for one person or for a family, and, as I said, it is peculiar in that it springs up and contains the element of refreshment and satisfaction; hence it is a beautiful symbol of the system of grace that God has established in Christ.<a name=121:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to show how it is connected with these two persons belonging to Abraham's house, knowing that many young ones here belong to households of faith.<a name=121:9></a> Abraham is said to be the father of all believers; he is the great patriarch, and so may be taken to represent every believer who has a household.<a name=121:10></a> It is said of Abraham that he would command his children and his house after him.<a name=121:11></a> In seeking to command their houses, believers are oft-times profoundly concerned about the members of their households, and God knows this.<a name=121:12></a> God has great regard for the head of a house who is concerned about every member of his house, and He will work with us in the salvation of our children.<a name=121:13></a> But in working with us.<a name=121:14></a> He would work <i>through</i> us, and if He is to work through us we must feel things.<a name=121:15></a> If we are concerned about a thing we will pray to
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God, and God will never fail to answer the prayer of faith.<a name=122:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first of these persons is called Hagar, and what is said of her is that an angel found her by a well.<a name=122:2></a> And what was she occupied in when he found her?<a name=122:3></a> In the path of disobedience, showing that God follows us up although we take the path of disobedience.<a name=122:4></a> She was disobedient, and if we are to be blessed through Christ, the element of obedience must show itself.<a name=122:5></a> The apostle Paul said, "I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision", but here is a member of Abraham's house actually fleeing from that house.<a name=122:6></a> From whom is she fleeing?<a name=122:7></a> From her mistress; from one who had authority over her; like many young men and women to whom the home authority becomes irksome, who wish to be free of it.<a name=122:8></a> The authority that God has placed in our parents is the very best kind of authority; it is the authority of love.<a name=122:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now you may say.<a name=122:10></a> Hagar was not fleeing from her parent.<a name=122:11></a> No, she was fleeing from her mistress; she was fleeing from one who had authority over her.<a name=122:12></a> Sarah is one of the most remarkable personages in Scripture; she belongs to the holy women of Scripture.<a name=122:13></a> True enough it is said that she oppressed Hagar, but then, she was her mistress, and Hagar was her bond-slave.<a name=122:14></a> So that you see she was entitled to exercise authority, and Hagar was manifesting an insubordinate will.<a name=122:15></a> Her mistress was being despised in her eyes.<a name=122:16></a> In other words Hagar is here therefore a type of an insubordinate young man or woman in a believer's household, and rather than submit to the authority, she flees.<a name=122:17></a> But where was she fleeing?<a name=122:18></a> That is the question the angel asks her.<a name=122:19></a> Where wilt thou go?<a name=122:20></a> he asks.<a name=122:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The angel says to Hagar, Where wilt thou go?<a name=123:14></a> He found her by a well of water.<a name=123:15></a> The angel of God is after this fleeing rebellious woman.<a name=123:16></a> It may be that Sarah was pleased that she left; it does not appear that she made any effort to recover her.<a name=123:17></a> And so it is that young people may leave their father's houses and their mother's houses, but God's eye is upon them.<a name=123:18></a> It may be that the door is on the latch for you to come back; that may be as it was in this case, for evidently Abraham's house was open to her to return, but there is no indication that Abraham or Sarah sent anyone after her.<a name=123:19></a> But look!<a name=123:20></a> God sent an angel from heaven after her.<a name=123:21></a> Is it not remarkable evidence of the grace of God?<a name=123:22></a> It says that the angel found her by a spring of water in the wilderness -- by the spring on the way to Shur; that is to say, it is not simply any spring, but a particular one, one that could be located.<a name=123:23></a> In other words in the spiritual application of it, it is a spring known to us who are christians, and you are by it at this very minute.<a name=123:24></a> So to speak, the angel of the Lord is
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=124>[Page 124]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		here to find you; he would remind you that you have been in the path of self-will, and that your salvation depends on giving up that path.<a name=124:1></a> So that he says, 'Return to thy mistress Sarah and be submissive to her'.<a name=124:2></a> You see, something had happened that brought out the insubordinate character of the woman.<a name=124:3></a> She had set out on a path of destruction and her only salvation lay in giving up that path and returning to her mistress Sarah.<a name=124:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, I would appeal to young people here tonight, that the angel of the Lord, or rather, the Lord Himself, is here to save you.<a name=124:5></a> But there must be submission; God is not going to fill heaven with insubject people.<a name=124:6></a> In His patience He has tolerated lawlessness in men for thousands of years on the earth, but all self-will and lawlessness is going to be cleared away; all must be in subjection to Christ.<a name=124:7></a> And so the word here is, 'Return and submit yourself'; that is the point.<a name=124:8></a> Hagar listens and she called the name of Jehovah who spoke to her, "Thou art the God who reveals himself".<a name=124:9></a> That is to say, she is in the presence of God.<a name=124:10></a> What a wonderful opportunity for her!<a name=124:11></a> Then the well that is alluded to here receives a name that remains -- Beer-lahai-roi, meaning 'the well of Him that seeth me'.<a name=124:12></a> That is the well.<a name=124:13></a> It is on the way to Shur, we are told.<a name=124:14></a> We christians know that; it is the well of Him that sees.<a name=124:15></a> We christians know what it is to come under the searching eye of a holy God -- like that well-known woman at Sychar who said, "Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did".<a name=124:16></a> She understood, you see, what it meant -- the well of Him that sees.<a name=124:17></a> Every true christian is thankful that God is seeing into his inmost soul, and as we judge ourselves before God, we come into the benefit of this well.<a name=124:18></a> This well is connected with Isaac later; it is seen as Rebecca approaches him.<a name=124:19></a> He stands related to this well.<a name=124:20></a> That is to say, Christ in heaven stands related

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		to this well.<a name=125:1></a> So that the assembly knows, Rebecca knows, the significance of the well.<a name=125:2></a> Rebecca is a type of the assembly composed of all believers; she understood the value of the well.<a name=125:3></a> She was accustomed to carrying the water pitcher and filling it at the well.<a name=125:4></a> When Abraham's servant drew near she let down the water pitcher and he drank; she gave him drink and the camels also.<a name=125:5></a> That shows that all true believers come into the appreciation and use of the well.<a name=125:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to show from chapter 21 that whilst this well was available to Hagar, apparently she never got the good of it.<a name=125:7></a> And this is a warning to all young people, that whilst God follows you up in grace, you may in the end not get the good of it.<a name=125:8></a> The time may come when you will have to say, 'The harvest is passed and the summer is ended and I am not saved'.<a name=125:9></a> Hagar had returned to Abraham's house, but her offspring of whom it was said, he would be a wild ass of a man, had proved himself to be this, and now both she and he are cast out.<a name=125:10></a> How dreadful to be actually cast outside of a believer's house.<a name=125:11></a> It is one thing to flee in self-will, but it is another to be cast out.<a name=125:12></a> The word is, "Cast out this handmaid and her son".<a name=125:13></a> You may say, 'One in that case is beyond salvation'.<a name=125:14></a> Not yet.<a name=125:15></a> Not yet, young man; you belong to a christian's house, and God has great regard for the prayers of your father and mother, and although you are outcast, God is still following you up.<a name=125:16></a> So you find Hagar and Ishmael here in the wilderness; the water in the bottle that Abraham put upon her is all spent.<a name=125:17></a> Like the prodigal she has nothing now, but look -- let this touch our hearts!<a name=125:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Ishmael had been persecuting Isaac, and he is an outcast, but God hears his voice.<a name=126:15></a> It is the dispensation of grace -- the grace that carries salvation for all men has appeared.<a name=126:16></a> And so God heard the voice of the lad; He heard it where the lad was.<a name=126:17></a> And where was he?<a name=126:18></a> He was under a shrub, about to die, cast there to die.<a name=126:19></a> God heard his voice where he was.<a name=126:20></a> In other words, God knows all about your circumstances.<a name=126:21></a> You may have gone far into the world and indulged yourself -- disgraced your parents it may be, dishonoured the Lord's name it may be, but now, you see, a voice goes up, a cry of need, and God hears you where you are.<a name=126:22></a> Well now, you will observe in verse 18 the angel says to Hagar, "Arise, take the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the epistle to the Romans I learn that I stand before God in my responsibility; I stand before the bar of God as convicted -- a sinner.<a name=127:6></a> All have sinned and come short of the glory of God.<a name=127:7></a> My case is truly hopeless unless God acts.<a name=127:8></a> And so that epistle says, "But now .<a name=127:9></a>.<a name=127:10></a>.<a name=127:11></a> the righteousness of God is manifested towards .<a name=127:12></a>.<a name=127:13></a>.<a name=127:14></a> all, and upon all those who believe: for there is no difference .<a name=127:15></a>.<a name=127:16></a>.<a name=127:17></a> being justified freely by his grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus; whom God has set forth a mercy seat, through faith in his blood".<a name=127:18></a> You see, that is exactly Hagar's position, she is standing with the boy in her hands before God.<a name=127:19></a> And so in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3">Romans  3</a>the sinner stands before God in his responsibility, and he is truly lost unless God acts for him.<a name=127:20></a> But God <i>has</i> acted for us; He has sent forth His Son -- "whom God has set forth a mercy-seat, through faith in his blood".<a name=127:21></a> So that God is "just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus".<a name=127:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, all this grace is brought to Hagar and Ishmael.<a name=127:23></a> It says in verse 19 that God opened her eyes and she saw the well of water.<a name=127:24></a> As I have been saying, it is God's wonderful system of grace that He has set up for us.<a name=127:25></a> He opens her eyes to see it.<a name=127:26></a> May He open <i>your</i> eyes, and may you embrace this wonderful opportunity of being saved, to receive forgiveness of sins and the gift of the Holy Spirit, so that the well is in yourself, that which, as it says, is in the believer a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life.<a name=127:27></a> As the Lord further says, "Whosoever drinks of the water .<a name=127:28></a>.<a name=127:29></a>.<a name=127:30></a> shall never thirst for ever".<a name=127:31></a> Would you not like to have such water, such a well?<a name=127:32></a> We are not speaking merely of

		J.T.<a name=264:1></a> In considering now the several types of the assembly, it is thought to be occupied with the attendant circumstances in each type which are of particular importance, especially the suggestions of the activities of the Holy Spirit in connection with the types of the assembly.<a name=264:2></a> In this chapter we have much that points to the Spirit of God, especially in His refreshing and fructifying power.<a name=264:3></a> The moistening in verse 6 is to be noted.<a name=264:4></a> We are told that "a mist went up from the earth, and moistened the whole surface of the ground.<a name=264:5></a> And Jehovah Elohim formed Man, dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and Man became a living soul".<a name=264:6></a> Following that we have the greatest type of the assembly, that is Eve.<a name=264:7></a> The assembly as viewed in Eve is seen apart from sin.<a name=264:8></a> Sin had not yet come into the earth, and God would give us a view of the assembly apart from sin, for that is how she will appear eternally.<a name=264:9></a> In the measure in which the Holy Spirit is recognised in His varied activities we may now arrive at an understanding of the assembly thus viewed in a sinless condition.<a name=264:10></a> It may be thought by some that we should begin with the lower types of the assembly, but it seems to be better to proceed as God gives it to us.<a name=264:11></a> He begins at the top and gives us a type of the assembly as it will go on eternally without any question of sin ever having been attached to it.<a name=264:12></a> Paul alludes to this when he says, "<i>I</i> speak as to Christ, and as to the assembly".<a name=264:13></a> That is what was in his mind, we may say, throughout the epistle to the Ephesians.<a name=264:14></a> That epistle looks into eternity and the Spirit now, I think, would help us to begin thus, and then work down to the other types so that we may see how

		J.T.<a name=286:1></a> The brethren will bear in mind that we are considering the assembly as presented in the types in the Old Testament, especially having regard to the fact that the Spirit is seen in them.<a name=286:2></a> We had <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2">Genesis  2</a>this forenoon, and the Spirit was dwelt on in a somewhat extended way, principally under the figure of water, and in our present type we have the Spirit also, but typified in the man, that is, Abraham's servant, the chief servant of his house.<a name=286:3></a> We also have the Spirit in the wells.<a name=286:4></a> There are two wells mentioned in this chapter, and we may say the camels also represent the power of the Spirit in this chapter, because it is a question of the power by which we are carried as of the assembly.<a name=286:5></a> So we have Abraham's servant as a type of the Spirit and then the two wells and the camels.<a name=286:6></a> I think the brethren will see the importance of enlarging on the truth of the Spirit in the types, because the Spirit is so absolutely essential to the assembly's formation, and to her maintenance and movements, her journey to Christ.<a name=286:7></a> Rebecca, as we shall see, indicates in her own person the place of the assembly, as already formed before the servant found her.<a name=286:8></a> She belonged to the family of Abraham.<a name=286:9></a> There is no question of family in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2">Genesis  2</a>.<a name=286:10></a> Now it is a question of family links; the sister before you have the bride.<a name=286:11></a> Sarah's family and Abraham's father's family furnish not only types of Christ, but also of the assembly, and the sisterhood.<a name=286:12></a> The idea of sisterhood must precede the idea of the bride.<a name=286:13></a> Therefore, it is a question of finding a sister first, one who is of the lineage of Abraham.<a name=286:14></a> So the servant in giving thanks says, "Blessed be Jehovah.<a name=286:15></a> God of my master Abraham, who has not withdrawn his loving-kindness and his faithfulness from my

		Leah represents the assembly, the gentiles, that is ourselves, and is not so attractive as Israel was historically; she was tender eyed, whereas Rachel is very beautiful both as to form and generally.<a name=307:6></a> Asnath has no special features at all save that she is in the position of wife to Joseph in this important administrative position that he occupies in Egypt.<a name=307:7></a> The Lord will help us to see the point in each type, but Rebecca is the most important in the book, next to Eve, and as we had yesterday, she typifies the assembly as the bride of the heavenly man, that is Christ typified in Isaac; great space is given to her in this long chapter and later on, too, as far as chapter 27, where she is concerned about the wives that Esau had, Canaanitish women.<a name=307:8></a> The assembly is thus followed up in her, as a type, as discriminating, and judging mixed marriages, which is a very important matter.<a name=307:9></a> She is recognised as a holy seed in sisterhood, so that three times over it is mentioned here, that her father

		J.T.<a name=308:6></a> To bring the thing down to practice, what is referred to there in the closing word of the servant to Bethuel and Laban, is we might say a presentation of a case as we call it, for fellowship in a care meeting.<a name=308:7></a> The chapter affords richness in the way of prayer and worship, the fact that assembly material comes to light.<a name=308:8></a> The man, it says, "Stooped, and bowed down before Jehovah, and said, Blessed be Jehovah, God of my master Abraham, who has not withdrawn his loving-kindness and his faithfulness from my master; I being in the way, Jehovah has led me to the house of my master's brethren".<a name=308:9></a> Then we have what the maiden told her mother's house in verse 28, and then we read that Rebecca had a brother named Laban.<a name=308:10></a> Now we have to watch him to see how he is going to act and how the matter may be brought into the care meeting of the saints.<a name=308:11></a> Laban is an outstanding personage, because he takes the lead of his father and mother.<a name=308:12></a> He and his mother finally decided that the woman should not leave for ten days; that is postponement which is often very dangerous in regard to the saints, especially where there are matters calling for judgment.<a name=308:13></a> The servant's speech to them begins in verse 34, after he refused to eat before he told his business.<a name=308:14></a> It runs down to verse 49, and he is what we might call the leading brother for the moment.<a name=308:15></a> Laban is in mind as the leading brother after this speech in which the facts are stated.<a name=308:16></a> In verse 50 Laban speaks before his father, and says, "The thing proceeds

		What is in mind is to speak of light, and I selected these scriptures to speak about this as it comes out in these four persons, having in view that light comes through persons.<a name=370:1></a> In the beginning, the light was commanded to shine out of darkness.<a name=370:2></a> The wording is significant.<a name=370:3></a> No person is mentioned from whence it shone, but the application of the passage in the New Testament connects it with the Lord Jesus.<a name=370:4></a> "God who spoke that out of darkness light should shine who has shone in our hearts for the shining forth of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:6">2 Corinthians  4:6</a>.<a name=370:5></a> Clearly there it is connected with the Person of Christ and with ourselves as persons.<a name=370:6></a>

		Having that passage in mind, I wish to make application of the four passages read to the present time, a time of darkness, and indeed a time in which people are sitting in darkness -- restful, we might say, in it.<a name=370:7></a> Many will not have it pointed out to them that they are sitting in darkness; they are wholly without feeling as to it, for when it comes to moral things, men are without shame, alas, as ignorant, but still the light comes into the darkness.<a name=370:8></a> Ordinarily light dispels darkness, but in moral things the darkness remains, although the light shines, as John says, "the light appears in darkness, and the darkness apprehended it not", <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:5">John  1:5</a>.<a name=370:9></a> The darkness remained.<a name=370:10></a> Here the light intruded itself from the divine side.<a name=370:11></a> Matthew says, quoting Isaiah, "The people sitting in darkness has seen a great light", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#4:16">Matthew  4:16</a>.<a name=370:12></a> They have seen it.<a name=370:13></a> It alludes to Christ, confirming what I am saying, that light is in persons properly.<a name=370:14></a> The first chapter of Genesis typically

		Christianity is not a stationary thing.<a name=372:4></a> It is movable.<a name=372:5></a> John presents this in chapter 10, where he speaks of the flock.<a name=372:6></a> A flock is movable.<a name=372:7></a> Christendom has become a fold or folds; but they are not movable.<a name=372:8></a> Christianity involves a flock and it is moved by light.<a name=372:9></a> As the Lord says, "I am the light of the world; he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life", <a href="../bible/John.htm#8:12">John  8:12</a>.<a name=372:10></a> So the believer, characteristically one of the sheep of Christ, follows the shepherd, the Lord tells us through John.<a name=372:11></a> They are alert for the light, and they follow a light shining.<a name=372:12></a> Otherwise they may miss their way, they may be left behind, as others move on.<a name=372:13></a> Now Jacob says immediately when Joseph is born and his mother had named him, "Send me away, that I may go to my place".<a name=372:14></a> He had been with Laban for fourteen years.<a name=372:15></a> Why move away?<a name=372:16></a> Well, it was not the place for addition.<a name=372:17></a> The light coming into his soul involved addition, but that was not the place for addition.<a name=372:18></a> You do not want to add to yourself in the circumstances of unbelief.<a name=372:19></a> The more you do, the more you will be stationary and you may lose your way.<a name=372:20></a> "Woe unto them that add house to house, that join field to field", says the prophet Isaiah, chapter 5: 8.<a name=372:21></a> The ray of light in the birth of that child and what is said about him told Jacob that he must move.<a name=372:22></a> Is this a voice to someone here, who is stationary religiously, and perhaps thinking you should be?<a name=372:23></a> The truth is that you belong to the flock of Christ, and He moves, and the flock follow Him.<a name=372:24></a> "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me", <a href="../bible/John.htm#10:27">John  10:27</a>.<a name=372:25></a>

		J.T.<a name=406:1></a> The idea of dispensations in Genesis from chapter 8 onwards takes two features; the first is in relation to Noah himself and his sons, and the second is in relation to Abraham to bring out the call of God and the patriarchal idea, that is, the development of family, a family of faith, in principle the family of God.<a name=406:2></a> I thought it well to begin with sacrifice as having a bearing on personality such as God implies first in Noah.<a name=406:3></a> He built an altar, we are told, to Jehovah, "and took of every clean animal, and of all clean fowl, and offered up burnt-offerings on the altar.<a name=406:4></a> And Jehovah smelled the sweet odour".<a name=406:5></a> The link with Noah's name is maintained here in the 'odour of rest'.<a name=406:6></a> His father had said, in giving him his name, "This one shall comfort us concerning our work and concerning the toil of our hands, because of the ground which Jehovah has cursed".<a name=406:7></a> So that in this interval we see the personality that God can employ in the great matter of what is to be carried through in the dispensations, and really, it is the basis of the new order of things, the new dispensation.<a name=406:8></a> God does not identify Himself with it publicly, but refers to it in His heart.<a name=406:9></a> "And Jehovah said in his heart, I will no more henceforth curse the ground on account of Man, for the thought of Man's heart is evil from his youth; and I will no more smite every living thing, as I have done.<a name=406:10></a> Henceforth, all the days of the earth, seed time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night, shall not cease".<a name=406:11></a> That is what He said in His heart without committing Himself publicly.<a name=406:12></a> It is recorded hundreds of years later, but it does not say that He said this at the time, but it is what He said in His heart, so that public conditions

		would be affected, without committing Himself to it publicly.<a name=407:1></a> There is much that goes on.<a name=407:2></a> While the earth remains, God orders things secretly without committing Himself publicly.<a name=407:3></a> But then He takes up Noah and his sons in the next chapter formally.<a name=407:4></a> God blessed Noah and his sons.<a name=407:5></a> Now in him we see the personality that God can identify Himself with publicly and a covenant is made with him, which is universal in its bearing.<a name=407:6></a> It is a question of man still, because of what God had already said in His heart.<a name=407:7></a> The word in chapter 8: 21, is, "on account of Man".<a name=407:8></a> It is a question of man and God's dealings with him, not angels, but man and cattle.<a name=407:9></a> So that God takes up Noah and his family and blesses them and enters into covenant with them, a covenant that extends right down in accordance with what He said in His heart.<a name=407:10></a> All nations and persons are affected by this covenant, and it runs right down.<a name=407:11></a> The second great feature is God calling a man out, dealing especially with his family and blessing him, making him a blessing on family lines; so the passage in chapter 49 was read to show how the idea of blessing on family lines and patriarchal lines runs down.<a name=407:12></a> And it merges in the assembly, merges in the kingdom of Israel, the house which Jacob had the light of, and develops into christianity.<a name=407:13></a>

		Well, now, I do not wish to spend all the time before I get to my main point, but I wanted to bring out this point of dignity in these one hundred and fifty-three fishes and how they point to the dignity of the nations as they come into God's possession in the future.<a name=525:19></a> There is no moral dignity attached to the nations now.<a name=525:20></a> Not that I want to say a word against them, but there is none.<a name=525:21></a> There is none where there is not a full recognition of Christ.<a name=525:22></a> But then when the Lord gathers the nations they will be worth gathering.<a name=525:23></a> He is going to have them.<a name=525:24></a> "And the nations shall walk by its light; and the kings of the earth bring their glory to it", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21:24">Revelation  21:24</a>.<a name=525:25></a> That is a clear indication of what they will be.<a name=525:26></a> How rich, how wealthy, how valuable, how worth having.<a name=525:27></a> That is really what is meant dispensationally.<a name=525:28></a> You can see the importance of this after-thought, that surely the Lord would not want to leave the nations out.<a name=525:29></a> His earthly people, that is, the Jews, are involved in Thomas in the second meeting in chapter 20, and the assembly is in the first meeting, and it would look as if the Lord were to say, 'Well, I must not

		So, we have one hundred and fifty-three great fishes.<a name=526:4></a> They are counted.<a name=526:5></a> Whether they are all the same size, I cannot say, but they are worth having.<a name=526:6></a> The Lord said, "Bring of the fishes which ye have now taken".<a name=526:7></a> They are recognised; they are owned as having taken them although the Lord had directed how it should happen, saying, "Cast the net at the right side of the ship and ye will find".<a name=526:8></a> As I was saying a moment ago, was it not a miracle?<a name=526:9></a> Were they just fish that were usually caught there?<a name=526:10></a> Who can say?<a name=526:11></a> Why not say they were prepared for the purpose.<a name=526:12></a> So the nations will be prepared for the purpose.<a name=526:13></a> They are not in evidence now.<a name=526:14></a> The nations <i>now</i> are represented in ourselves.<a name=526:15></a> God is gathering His people out of the nations and is placing them in the assembly, so that we have to understand what these fishes really are.<a name=526:16></a> They are great.<a name=526:17></a> The nations as they are today are wanting.<a name=526:18></a> God is owning them, and they are here today, but they are not the ones that are pictured in that one hundred and fifty-three great fishes.<a name=526:19></a> They are the product of the labourers, of the Israelites, the twelve, whoever they may be; the working people of that day.<a name=526:20></a> They will be honoured in the nations being gathered together for their service.<a name=526:21></a> "And the nations shall walk by its light".<a name=526:22></a> It is a very beautiful phrase.<a name=526:23></a> They walk in the light of the heavenly city.<a name=526:24></a> That is to say, they walk in the light of the assembly in heavenly glory, and also, they bring their glory to it, showing how entirely they are secured for heaven.<a name=526:25></a>

		So, as I said, these one hundred and fifty-three fishes, great fishes, point to dignity in this part of the gospel.<a name=526:26></a> They point to a dispensational result in the future, but then, as the Spirit of God says, "Every scripture is divinely inspired, and profitable for teaching" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#3:16">2 Timothy  3:16</a>), and this is profitable

		now for more than I have said.<a name=527:1></a> It is profitable for ourselves, because in these last days I believe God is aiming at dignity among the brethren.<a name=527:2></a> Of course, we have to own that there are very few persons of value coming in among us.<a name=527:3></a> We may as well accept that.<a name=527:4></a> There are some.<a name=527:5></a> Thank God there are some among us who have not come in in that sense.<a name=527:6></a> They are born and brought up among us and, of course, they are the best.<a name=527:7></a> And yet, surely, there is something for us as to persons of value in the service and ornamentation of the assembly through those coming in through the gospel.<a name=527:8></a> There are many of them abroad, and the Spirit of God shows that in the early days there were distinguished men.<a name=527:9></a> Some distinguished in this world like Theophilus and Paul, and many others; but there are others distinguished as converted through spirituality and that is the great point.<a name=527:10></a> There is no value really in what a person may have been before.<a name=527:11></a> It is what he is after his conversion or through his conversion.<a name=527:12></a> The great fishes must represent those that are the fruit of the work of God, and we must admit, dear brethren, that we have very few.<a name=527:13></a> But we thank God for what we have, at least, I hope we do.<a name=527:14></a> I do for the number here today.<a name=527:15></a> The dignity, the spiritual dignity manifest in a number of persons such as are sitting here listening to the word of God, and valuing it; valuing the fellowship we are in today.<a name=527:16></a> Surely it is a great matter, but it could be greater and it may be greater.<a name=527:17></a> It can be greater.<a name=527:18></a> God can make it greater.<a name=527:19></a> And so I go on to the sheep.<a name=527:20></a> The great fishes are one idea.<a name=527:21></a> They represent quality and value, value in the eyes of heaven.<a name=527:22></a> And the apostles are seen as capable of catching them, although the Lord really did all the work, you might say.<a name=527:23></a> He told them where to cast the net.<a name=527:24></a> But they drew the fishes in and the Lord says, "Bring of the fishes which ye have now taken".<a name=527:25></a> That is a beautiful thought.<a name=527:26></a> If the brethren have
