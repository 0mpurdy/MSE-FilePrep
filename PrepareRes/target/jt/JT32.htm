		J.T.<a name=1:1></a> I hope the Lord will give something a little outside of what most of us understand in this gospel.<a name=1:2></a> Certain features have occurred to one.<a name=1:3></a> First there is the abruptness with which the writer introduces his subject, which reminds us of secret history with God.<a name=1:4></a> We have public history; but persons being introduced abruptly without any previous history being given would suggest the perfect knowledge God has of those He takes up for service, they take it up as having had educative relations with Himself.<a name=1:5></a> The introduction of John the Baptist here is in line with this, as also that of the Lord Himself, "Beginning of the glad tidings of Jesus Christ, Son of God".<a name=1:6></a> The same thing appears in certain characters of the Old Testament.<a name=1:7></a> Aaron and Elijah particularly are introduced in the service without their previous history being given; the first being typical of all Levites, because he is formally called "the Levite"; besides, in speaking of him to Moses God intimates His acquaintance with him, both as to his <i>speaking ability</i> and his <i>heart</i>.<a name=1:8></a> Elijah comes in with <i>authority</i>.<a name=1:9></a> If one has authority in service there can be no question of one's previous relations with God.<a name=1:10></a> Then there is certain teaching in relation to the <i>sea</i> this gospel in which the Lord may help us later.<a name=1:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.H.<a name=1:12></a>E.<a name=1:13></a> Why is the Lord introduced as "Son of God" rather than as Son of Abraham and Son of David as in Matthew?<a name=1:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:15></a> I think it is in regard to the dignity and finality of the service; that personality necessarily marks those who are serving; not only that there is history with God,

	<div class="paragraph">
		but personality through family relationship.<a name=2:1></a> This applies to the Lord Himself, although in Person of course He is unique; but the personality involved in family relationship underlies all service, as seen in the Levites, who were all firstborn ones.<a name=2:2></a> This family dignity is owned and confirmed by God as the result of a secret history pleasing to Him.<a name=2:3></a> Thus here the voice from heaven to Christ is, "<i>Thou</i> art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight".<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Eu.<a name=2:5></a>R.<a name=2:6></a> Have you any thought why it begins, "Beginning of the glad tidings"?<a name=2:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:8></a> The idea is that the vessel is, <i>fully</i> in the thing.<a name=2:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am speaking now of ourselves, but this is seen in the Lord, who is our example in everything.<a name=2:10></a> Paul's ministry did not begin properly until <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13">Acts  13</a>although he had served before.<a name=2:11></a> This gospel treats specially of Levitical principles, not the Levitical principles that are the subject: in the book of Joshua, but as in Numbers.<a name=2:12></a> We have to take account of the Levites from the standpoint of Numbers, and also from the standpoint of Joshua.<a name=2:13></a> In the latter they are seen as typically heavenly, exerting heavenly influence.<a name=2:14></a> In Numbers the Levite entered into service at the age of twenty-five, but thirty was the age at which he began his service properly.<a name=2:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		M.W.<a name=2:16></a>B.<a name=2:17></a> Would you contrast the line of service in Mark with that in John?<a name=2:18></a> I was wondering whether you had in mind the more formal kind of service as in Mark.<a name=2:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:20></a> Exactly.<a name=2:21></a>.<a name=2:22></a> John treats of the Lord's service as proceeding from Himself without any regard to the principles that should govern the Levite.<a name=2:23></a> That is, He does not wait for John to be cast into prison, but proceeds of himself.<a name=2:24></a> In the others he waits for this occurrence.<a name=2:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		M.W.<a name=2:26></a>B.<a name=2:27></a> Yes; you referred to <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13">Acts  13</a>in regard to tile apostle, but he had preached before that; there is a contrast.<a name=2:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:29></a> Yes; his proper beginning was as sent out by

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=3>[Page 3]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the Holy Spirit.<a name=3:1></a> That is, there might be a good deal of previous work, and very good work too, but the beginning of a man's service is when God formally recognizes him as called into service.<a name=3:2></a> That is what is in mind here: "Beginning of the glad tidings of Jesus Christ, Son of God".<a name=3:3></a> Therefore the Spirit goes back to the prophet, not resting only on the Person of the Son of God as in John; He is observing the Levitical principles.<a name=3:4></a> So that He goes on immediately to cite the prophet in regard to John the Baptist.<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Eu.<a name=3:6></a>R.<a name=3:7></a> So in transferring this to ourselves after the link with the brethren and the assembly.<a name=3:8></a> Is that what you had in mind?<a name=3:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:10></a> Yes.<a name=3:11></a> One has often thought of the dual transaction of <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13">Acts  13</a>the transaction with the <i>Lord</i> directly, and then the transaction with the <i>brethren</i>, which Saul had.<a name=3:12></a> These two things go together in regard of the way for the Levitical position; at Antioch they lay their hands on him as the Holy Spirit recognized him.<a name=3:13></a> Ananias represented the brethren at Damascus.<a name=3:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.J.<a name=3:15></a> Does that verse shew that Paul had a good deal of influence in the writing of this gospel?<a name=3:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:17></a> Mark is the writer undoubtedly, and you can understand how the Holy Spirit would use him as conversant with Paul's gospel, that is, the gospel of the Son of God.<a name=3:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.J.<a name=3:19></a> Yes; I thought of the fine word at the end of 2 Timothy about Mark: "He is serviceable to me for ministry",(<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#4:11">2 Timothy  4:11</a>).<a name=3:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:21></a> No one could be more serviceable than the writer of this gospel, and the apostle must have had great concern, about the continuance of the ministry.<a name=3:22></a> Mark would greatly help to promote it.<a name=3:23></a> That the apostle could thus speak of Mark, as he was about to pass out of the service himself bears, I believe, on this gospel.<a name=3:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.H.<a name=4:1></a>B.<a name=4:2></a> I thought the verse (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:23">Hebrews  12:23</a>) you called attention to would shew that all levitical service should be carried out in the light of sonship.<a name=4:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.L.<a name=4:4></a> So the Levites are the firstborn.<a name=4:5></a> Would that link up with the "Son of God"?<a name=4:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:7></a> Yes; each one was a firstborn, and what I think we may see in that connection is that it would imply the influence of heaven in our service; not merely that we have a personality, but our <i>position</i> is heaven.<a name=4:8></a> As the seventy return and record their great success in the service, the Lord says, "Yet in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subjected to you, but rejoice that your names are written in the heavens", (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10:20">Luke  10:20</a>).<a name=4:9></a> That takes one out of the undue influence of success in the service; the servant retires into the greatness of his heavenly position, and that is really the great safeguard for us in successful service.<a name=4:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.D'A.<a name=4:11></a>C.<a name=4:12></a> Why does Paul say, "He is serviceable to <i>me</i> for ministry"?<a name=4:13></a> Why not to the saints or the brethren?<a name=4:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:15></a> I suppose he was profitable to him personally, and that is why he wanted him to be with him.<a name=4:16></a> The apostle's ministry in Rome would be largely in writing "The parchments" would indicate this, and Mark would serve in this connection.<a name=4:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Eu.<a name=4:18></a>R.<a name=4:19></a> Was the Lord Himself the pattern of that retirement when service was apparently unsuccessful, when He said, "I thank thee, O Father"?<a name=4:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:21></a> It is just at that point He says that.<a name=4:22></a> It is in Matthew you get that feature, where His rejection is very evident.<a name=4:23></a> He retires into the sense of what He was with His Father who had "hid these things from the wise and prudent".<a name=4:24></a> But in Luke what occasions the praise is that their names are <i>written in heaven</i>; and then He speaks to the Father as to this, that He had revealed "these things" to the babes, and hidden them from the wise and prudent, and then He goes on to speak to His Father about Himself, that "no one knows who the Son is but the Father,

	<div class="paragraph">
		and who the Father is but the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son is pleased to reveal him", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10:22">Luke  10:22</a>.<a name=5:1></a> Then <i>He turns to the disciples</i>, as much as to say, all this is to influence you so that they should not be unduly occupied with their success.<a name=5:2></a> We should, of course, thank God for the success, but the retirement into the thought of what one is in heaven, is deliverance, and maintains the balance.<a name=5:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=5:4></a> Do you regard Mark's gospel as indicating Christ serving here as a model?<a name=5:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:6></a> Yes; as the "Son of God".<a name=5:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Eu.<a name=5:8></a>R.<a name=5:9></a> Is it your thought that the Son of God here is based more on Luke's gospel: "The holy thing also which shall be born shall be called Son of God"?<a name=5:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:11></a> It is "shall be <i>called</i>" personality acquired.<a name=5:12></a> The title is after certain history; of course the Person was there, but came out in Him as man is in view.<a name=5:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Eu.<a name=5:14></a>R.<a name=5:15></a> And then, "Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?<a name=5:16></a>" and then His baptism is based on that.<a name=5:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:18></a> Quite; the Father's voice speaks of what He <i>found</i> in Him.<a name=5:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.E.<a name=5:20></a>S.<a name=5:21></a> Are both thoughts of dignity given in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#4">Exodus  4</a>, where God says, "Israel is my son, my firstborn .<a name=5:22></a>.<a name=5:23></a>.<a name=5:24></a> .<a name=5:25></a> Let my son go, that he may serve me"?<a name=5:26></a>
	</div>

		J.T.<a name=5:27></a> Yes; all that came out in Christ.<a name=5:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=5:29></a> Does the character of the service in Mark involve that a vessel shall be given over to it <i>entirely</i>?<a name=5:30></a>
	</div>

		J.T.<a name=5:31></a> Yes; <i>addicted</i> to it.<a name=5:32></a>

		Rem.<a name=5:33></a> We may take up service in an incidental sort of way, such as preaching the gospel on the Lord's day, and forget the levitical side during the other days of the week.<a name=5:34></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=5:35></a> Would you say what was in your mind in referring to the Levites in Numbers and in Joshua?<a name=5:36></a> What is the distinction?<a name=5:37></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=6>[Page 6]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:1></a> Numbers, in general, gives the <i>toilsome</i> side, we "labour and suffer reproach".<a name=6:2></a> The word used in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#4">Numbers  4</a>, for the Levite calling involves strenuous work (Compare <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1:8">2 Timothy  1:8</a>,2:3); whereas Joshua generally treats of the Levites as priests, and that they have no inheritance here on earth.<a name=6:3></a> The book emphasises their heavenly position and privileges, particularly that besides the sacrifices of the Lord they had forty eight cities in Israel, meaning that they would not be heavenly only, but persons in cities, apprehending the idea of a city.<a name=6:4></a> The idea of a city is accentuated in the forty-eight that their influence should flow out universally city wise.<a name=6:5></a> It implies, therefore, an understanding of the thought of God in a city; that was to be seen in the Levites in the way of influence.<a name=6:6></a> Their commonwealth was in heaven; and so the great thing from that point of view would be heavenly influence, but citywise, not simply the idea of heaven, but the idea of a city; for that is the way heaven takes form finally in its relation with the earth.<a name=6:7></a> That is, it comes out concretely in an intelligent, understandable way; because a city is a known idea, and God graciously comes into our range in known ideas.<a name=6:8></a> Heaven, as a place is hardly known to men.<a name=6:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=6:10></a> Would "forty eight" imply administration universally?<a name=6:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:12></a> It is administration in an influential way.<a name=6:13></a> The heavenly city is light and rule, but rule of a most benign kind.<a name=6:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.J.<a name=6:15></a>McB.<a name=6:16></a> And is your idea that it comes out now as it will do by and by?<a name=6:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:18></a> Yes.<a name=6:19></a> You lay hold of the idea of a city, and it works out in your influence.<a name=6:20></a> It takes a person out of his individuality and sets him in relation to the city; particularly the cities of refuge, because those belonged to the levites; that there should be the continuance of grace; this was to be maintained amongst <i>them</i>.<a name=6:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.D'A.<a name=6:22></a>C.<a name=6:23></a> Those forming the heavenly city have

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=7>[Page 7]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		learned to exert city influence here before they come out in it.<a name=7:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:2></a> And one can see that the standpoint of Joshua is most important, but perhaps not much observed by us in our service.<a name=7:3></a> It takes us out of ruts and parties into a very high altitude where we are the distributors of grace in an ordered way, as in a city; so that it is distributed with intelligence.<a name=7:4></a> If our influence is only based on gift, we miss the teaching of Joshua.<a name=7:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Eu.<a name=7:6></a>R.<a name=7:7></a> Are you suggesting that our relations in our localities should take character from these cities, and that it is of great importance for a Levite to have a sense of being part of that heavenly administration?<a name=7:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:9></a> Yes.<a name=7:10></a> The 'suburbs' might at any time be examined as a <i>test</i>.<a name=7:11></a> Comparatively the suburbs were small, but they were large enough as a test as to what influence really there was.<a name=7:12></a> So, if I go to a locality and I am with God, I discern what kind of influence there is <i>there</i> whether it is heavenly; if so, it should be extended.<a name=7:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Eu.<a name=7:14></a>R.<a name=7:15></a> What does the suburb suggest to us?<a name=7:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:17></a> The <i>immediate</i> vicinity; sufficient to prove whether you have influence with God, We can test ourselves in that way.<a name=7:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=7:19></a> Were they not the same measurement as the ark was in front of the children of Israel as they crossed the Jordan, two thousand cubits?<a name=7:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:21></a> Yes.<a name=7:22></a> The distance, therefore, was not great; but it was enough to test just what influence was being exercised in any of those forty-eight cities, whether anything good was being done.<a name=7:23></a> So you can test the influence of the saints by the immediate vicinity.<a name=7:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.J.<a name=7:25></a> How do you account for this gospel beginning with the wilderness in contrast to what you said?<a name=7:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:27></a> That is a very important thing too, because the wilderness does not minister to the flesh.<a name=7:28></a> When the angel told Philip to go down to the road from Jerusalem

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=8>[Page 8]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		to Gaza, he told him it was a <i>desert</i> Philip would soon find this out, but he is specially told of it.<a name=8:1></a> That is to say, the servant has to make up his mind to that.<a name=8:2></a> It was said of John the baptist, in his private history, that he dwelt "in the deserts", not only in the desert, but in the deserts, shewing he had a <i>variety</i> of desert experience.<a name=8:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Eu.<a name=8:4></a>R.<a name=8:5></a> Then that has a place with us as to committing ourselves to the position.<a name=8:6></a> It says of Zion, "All my springs are in thee", (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#87:7">Psalm  87:7</a>); as accepting the position of service we are not to expect anything but wilderness conditions.<a name=8:7></a> If devoted to the service of the Lord, our springs are elsewhere.<a name=8:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:9></a> That is the idea.<a name=8:10></a> In kindness to you the Lord would convey that it is not an easy path; He said to one who followed Him, "The foxes have holes and the birds of the heaven roosting places, but the Son of man has not where he may lay his head", (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#9:58">Luke  9:58</a>).<a name=8:11></a> It is kindness because young people setting out in the Lord's service are sure to be disappointed unless they understand what is involved and know where to turn for support and provision.<a name=8:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.J.<a name=8:13></a> Do you think the desert experience of Philip was the balance to the success he had in Samaria?<a name=8:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:15></a> Yes.<a name=8:16></a> And it is in that way he is honoured progressively.<a name=8:17></a> First, as he accepts the direction of the angel and goes into the desert, the <i>Spirit</i> speaks to him.<a name=8:18></a> That is progressive honour.<a name=8:19></a> It is greater thing for the Holy Spirit to speak to him than an angel; and then he joins himself to the chariot, and conducts himself in such a manner that the Holy Spirit lays bald of him entirely, and catches him away.<a name=8:20></a> That would impress upon us that it is a question of how we conduct ourselves in the service.<a name=8:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Eu.<a name=8:22></a>R.<a name=8:23></a> So in regard of the Lord Jesus here, the Spirit comes upon Him early in this chapter, and then drives Him into the wilderness.<a name=8:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:25></a> Quite.<a name=8:26></a> That is another thing in Mark that

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		M.W.<a name=9:5></a>B.<a name=9:6></a> Do you associate that with the idea of personality?<a name=9:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=9:8></a> Of course His divinity underlies all, but it is acquired personality here; as also in Luke: He "shall be called Son of God".<a name=9:9></a> It is His personal excellence in private life, and so God is now acquainting Him from heaven with His delight in Him, which is very precious.<a name=9:10></a> We should not mar that with any self-occupation in service, any dwelling on our ability or success.<a name=9:11></a>

		H.H.<a name=9:18></a> We should appreciate the wilderness setting as that, which does not minister to the flesh, and so helps to establish us on the line of what it is to be for God here.<a name=9:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		H.E.<a name=9:20></a>S.<a name=9:21></a> Are you suggesting that a servant has a dual experience -- experience with God and wilderness experience?<a name=9:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=9:23></a> Quite; John "was in the deserts, until the day of his shewing to Israel", (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:80">Luke  1:80</a>).<a name=9:24></a> The world is definitely given up, and you do not minister to the flesh; you deny the flesh; otherwise you will not accept the service in all its glory.<a name=9:25></a> This, no doubt, explains Mark's breakdown.<a name=9:26></a> As accepting the wilderness we find what God can be to us in our service.<a name=9:27></a>

		J.T.<a name=45:1></a> Up to yesterday afternoon we were dwelling on the Lord's service by the sea.<a name=45:2></a> It was observed that the Lord's service in this gospel is particularly set in relation to it; having the sea in the centre as affording an opportunity for the principle indicated in it to be emphasised; so that the end of chapter 4 shews that the disciples were already acquiring a knowledge of the sea.<a name=45:3></a> The references to the Old Testament helped us as to the use of ships so that the wealth of the seas should be acquired.<a name=45:4></a> The end of chapter 4 shews that the Lord having been taken by the disciples "as he was, in the ship" proved His superiority to the element of opposition that might be expected to arise; for whilst the sea denotes the area of the gospel, and the divine sowing, as in <a href="../bible/chapter.htm#4">chapter  4</a>, it also suggests an area in which Satan has power.<a name=45:5></a>

		J.T.<a name=77:12></a> That is to bring out His dependence, which is most interesting.<a name=77:13></a> We have in this gospel two feedings of the multitude, as in Matthew.<a name=77:14></a> In the first, the Lord looks up to heaven, that is, He recognises heaven as a dependent Man here.<a name=77:15></a> In the second.<a name=77:16></a> He does not look up to heaven.<a name=77:17></a> In the first you have the order, fifties or hundreds in ranks; but in the second there is no specification for any such divisions, because it is a question of the power that is already there, that is, the Spirit You may minister the word by the Spirit to any number; but when He looks up, then the idea is the assembly as representative of heaven here, and you have specification as to numbers, that is, the fifties or hundreds, in this gospel.<a name=77:18></a> So I think looking up to heaven would mean an acknowledgment of heaven; the Lord's dependence on it when here, and the order corresponding with it.<a name=77:19></a>

		J.T.<a name=78:16></a> Just so, and I think that fits here.<a name=78:17></a> It says, "And he comes to Bethsaida; and they bring him a blind man, and beseech him that he might touch him.<a name=78:18></a> And taking hold of the hand of the blind man he led him forth out of the village, and having spit upon his eyes, he laid his hands upon him, and asked him if he beheld anything.<a name=78:19></a> And having looked up, he said, I behold men, for I see them, as trees, walking.<a name=78:20></a> Then he laid his hands again upon his eyes, and he saw distinctly, and was restored and saw all things clearly".<a name=78:21></a> I think that is the effect of the epistle to the Colossians, in the sense that it delivers you from man; you see everything in clear perspective.<a name=78:22></a>

		J.T.<a name=85:1></a> We observed yesterday that chapter 10 begins the second general division of the gospel.<a name=85:2></a> It is said of the Lord, "Rising up thence he comes into the coasts of Judaea, and the other side of the Jordan".<a name=85:3></a> Then later, verses 32 - 34, "And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was going on before them; and they were amazed, and were afraid as they followed.<a name=85:4></a> And taking the twelve again to him, he began to tell them what was going to happen to him: Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man shall be delivered up to the chief priests and to the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him up to the nations: and they shall mock him and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him; and after three days he shall rise again".<a name=85:5></a> These verses indicate what is now in view.<a name=85:6></a> The Lord had been labouring in relation to the sea, in connection with which there was no organised opposition, although there was opposition but now He is turning towards Jerusalem, and what we may see in our consideration of these remaining passages is the kind of material that comes to light in the blind man and the colt.<a name=85:7></a> We are now turned towards the recognised divine centre, but the facts developed shew that it was like "the hill of God" in the hands of the Philistine, in the enemy's hands, so that the Lord, in turning In that direction, asserts His rights.<a name=85:8></a> We are, therefore, in the presence of the full power of the enemy.<a name=85:9></a> That at the hill of God were outposts of the Philistines was a matter to be taken to heart; and the Lord, as facing all this, acquaints His disciples with what they might expect.<a name=85:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Eu.<a name=85:11></a>R.<a name=85:12></a> It is interesting that in invading Jerusalem the Spirit of God would draw attention to His coming first to the coasts of Judea and the other side of Jordan.<a name=85:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=86:3></a> Exactly.<a name=86:4></a> He came in by way of Trans-Jordanian territory; He came in that way.<a name=86:5></a> That is what is meant, I think.<a name=86:6></a> He approached <i>that</i> way.<a name=86:7></a>

		P.L.<a name=86:8></a> Are you connecting that with the experience of Israel?<a name=86:9></a> In regard of the Red Sea have we got more the expression "the way" and what lies in it; but in the crossing the Jordan with the ark the enemies are scattered.<a name=86:10></a> Is it the concentrated power against Christ here?<a name=86:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=86:12></a> Yes.<a name=86:13></a> Jericho stands for that; so that you have the expression that he followed Jesus "in the way", meaning that he took that way.<a name=86:14></a> That is to be noted "the way".<a name=86:15></a> Approaching Judaea and Jerusalem on this line we are reminded of the power in which the land was taken.<a name=86:16></a> It was a question of the "Lord of all the earth" that is to say, the rights of God entered into the crossing of the Jordan and taking possession of the land.<a name=86:17></a> It was the "ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth", and those powers enter into chapter 10.<a name=86:18></a> The Lord approaches similarly, and He finds material at Jericho corresponding very much with Rahab.<a name=86:19></a> That is, the blind man Bartimaeus recognises the Son of David.<a name=86:20></a> It is not an ordinary person believing for salvation, but one who recognises in his faith the Lord's right to the inheritance.<a name=86:21></a> That is, you have material that will stand up against the opposition that now is evident, as with Rahab.<a name=86:22></a>

		I wish to speak about the Holy Spirit, encouraged in the assurance that there will be not only a readiness to hear, but a measure of capacity for taking in any thoughts presented as to Him.<a name=128:1></a> I believe that it is of God to emphasise the presence of the Spirit.<a name=128:2></a> Indeed, it has occurred to me of late that it would be a profitable inquiry to see how He is presented in each of the books of Scripture, and with this in view I Save ventured to take up Luke, so that we might see how the Holy Spirit mentions himself in this book.<a name=128:3></a> For we have to bear in mind that, whilst the Lord says of Him, "He shall not speak from himself", that does not mean that He does not refer to Himself, for in truth He is the subject of testimony, as the Father is, and as the Son is.<a name=128:4></a> Indeed, we are said to be baptised to the name of "the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit".<a name=128:5></a> So that He fits in; He had His own place in the testimony; and I thought that the consideration of Luke in this regard would help us as to the dispensation viewed as in grace.<a name=128:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Luke is concerned as to how the gospel should reach men; the vessels through whom it should come; and so you find with him great prominence given to heaven, that the gospel should come to men clothed with heavenly influence.<a name=128:7></a> Hence, he introduces at once a great heavenly dignitary; for it was to be expected, we being what we are, that in the service of the gospel there would crop up a desire for personal distinction in it, such as painfully manifested itself at Corinth.<a name=128:8></a> So Luke would introduce the idea of personal dignity in Gabriel.<a name=128:9></a> Who of those at Corinth could measure up with him?<a name=128:10></a> The apostle in speaking to them refers to "the tongues of .<a name=128:11></a>.<a name=128:12></a>.<a name=128:13></a> angels", but here we have at the outset presented to us, not simply an angel, but a heavenly dignitary.<a name=128:14></a>

		visitation from heaven which Luke records, most interesting as they are for he would clothe the gospel with personal dignity, and with a heavenly atmosphere; that the thing might carry with it all possible commendation nothing to forbid, nothing to prejudice, but all calculated to invite; so that the most might be saved, that the greatest possible result should accrue.<a name=129:1></a> One is impressed with the divine forethought and preparation recorded by Luke, so that the gospel should be untrammeled; that nothing should be attached to it or detract from it, so as to render it unacceptable.<a name=129:2></a> Hence the Lord Himself is presented in Luke as personally attractive in His preaching; the manner in which He read die Scripture and His deportment, both in standing up and sitting down, and in speaking all was marked by the grace that God intended should adorn the proclamation of the gospel.<a name=129:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I wanted to dwell upon the Spirit, as I said, and what impresses one at first is the filling by Him of persons.<a name=129:4></a> Indeed, Luke throws out at the beginning a sort of atmosphere which would disallow all corruption and render null all fleshly taint.<a name=129:5></a> The incoming of the Saviour was to be guarded thus; and so we have a remarkable set of vessels filled with the Holy Spirit; thus shutting out from the environment of the Lord's birth all taint of contamination; for a group of persons appear, <i>filled</i> with the Holy Spirit.<a name=129:6></a> It is an important matter; for a half filled, or partly filled vessel is sure to be contaminated.<a name=129:7></a> Hence you find the first mention of the Spirit in this gospel is that He fills a person from the very outset of his being - John the Baptist - a marvellous thing!<a name=129:8></a> There may be an inquiry as to its possibility; but how else can we explain the movements of an unborn babe, as the sound of the voice of the mother of Christ falls upon the ears of his mother?<a name=129:9></a> What can be the thought, but of wonderful divine preparation, so that the incoming of our Saviour in such lowliness and outward

		Then the announcement of Gabriel himself; it is most interesting and touching to note the manner of his address to Mary.<a name=130:2></a> And when I speak of Mary, the thought of secret history comes into one's mind, of secret history with God.<a name=130:3></a> Who can tell what that history was?<a name=130:4></a> The angel Gabriel -- his name is given -- says to her, "Hail, thou favoured one!<a name=130:5></a> the Lord is with thee".<a name=130:6></a> Can we doubt that He had been with her?<a name=130:7></a> Can we doubt that He had watched over her as a unique vessel?<a name=130:8></a> Can we doubt but that He went far up the stream in her line?<a name=130:9></a> Can we doubt that there was extraordinary preparation in her, to be such a vessel, to be so honoured, so greeted, so saluted, by a great heavenly dignitary?<a name=130:10></a> The proof of all this is evidenced in her calm and subject demeanour in such august circumstances.<a name=130:11></a> And then in answer to her remarks he refers to the Holy Spirit, who alone could bring about the great design of eternity.<a name=130:12></a> "The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and power of the Highest overshadow thee".<a name=130:13></a> What a scene is suggested!<a name=130:14></a> An operation of operations, the like of which had never been known or thought of by men as such!<a name=130:15></a> The Holy Spirit had been employed in garnishing the heavens, and brooding over the face of the deep, and right along had been engaged in the divine operations, but now, there is an operation of operations: "The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and power of the Highest overshadow thee, wherefore the holy thing also which shall be born shall be called Son of God".<a name=130:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish to dwell for a moment on this, that we may apprehend what happened.<a name=130:17></a> Gabriel says, "that holy thing".<a name=130:18></a> Had the angel said, That holy Person, or That holy Babe, the thought would have been weaker, but it is a question of what will be.<a name=130:19></a> We have to understand the distinction between <i>what</i> the Lord Jesus is, and <i>who</i> He

	<div class="paragraph">
		Proceeding from this passage I wish to shew you how He is guarded by the Spirit as a Babe.<a name=131:10></a> The idea of the <i>thing</i> being introduced is made clear, and then we have "a <i>babe</i> wrapped in swaddling clothes", as it says, "and lying in a manger"; and later brought up to Jerusalem.<a name=131:11></a> I wish to dwell on what was in Jerusalem, that is, "a man … whose name was Simeon".<a name=131:12></a> Jerusalem here is not yet viewed as hostile.<a name=131:13></a> It was still the centre for God on earth, and there are grouped here very precious features in this still divinely recognised city.<a name=131:14></a> One would love to be consciously in the centre; I believe God would have it so, that as giving us the Spirit He would link us on with the centre of His things.<a name=131:15></a> It delivers and saves us from mere localism and nationalism.<a name=131:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish to dwell upon this because the opposition now is on account of the smallness of things outwardly.<a name=132:6></a> This marks our own times; how much therefore it is incumbent upon us to recognise the Spirit, the anointing; so as to be able, so to say, to hold the Child.<a name=132:7></a> I allude to the Child for a moment as referring to the outward smallness of things; but how intrinsically precious at this moment!<a name=132:8></a> What a spectacle for heaven to see the priest with the Child in his arms, in the full light of God regarding it!<a name=132:9></a> What an awful darkness is spread abroad today around us, especially with regard to the Person of Christ!<a name=132:10></a> The best refutation of the error is the priest with the Child in his arms, and the light of God in his soul regarding it.<a name=132:11></a> It is God's salvation, and God's salvation seen.<a name=132:12></a> What a word that is for us as the powers of darkness are felt abroad!<a name=132:13></a>

		I want to go on to the last scripture, and what I wish to dwell upon in closing is "the promise of the Father", how the Father is brought in at the end, so that we may see fully what the dispensation is.<a name=137:2></a> It is "The promise of <i>my</i> Father", but before that the Lord says, "<i>Ye</i> are witnesses", not yet "My witnesses".<a name=137:3></a> That is to say, it is not here that He is calling them to the witness stand; the point is that they were eye witnesses.<a name=137:4></a> In the Acts it says, "Ye shall be my witnesses", but here the emphasis is on them, on what they were.<a name=137:5></a> The New Translation shews that '<i>Ye</i>'.<a name=137:6></a> They were cognisant of what appeared in the Lord's ministry; they have not only been to school, but they have seen things.<a name=137:7></a> They were not hearsay to them.<a name=137:8></a> We should learn to see things, so as to become witnesses of them, that is, persons competent to speak of them as knowing them.<a name=137:9></a> That is the idea.<a name=137:10></a> But then that is not enough.<a name=137:11></a> To be sent is another matter, jailed into the witness box.<a name=137:12></a> And so the Lord says, "Behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you".<a name=137:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now you see we are in the presence of the Father.<a name=137:14></a> This is the closing touch, that is to say, it is God in grace and in love too.<a name=137:15></a> It has been remarked that the name always stands in relation to grace.<a name=137:16></a> "The Father judgeth no man".<a name=137:17></a> Here we have His <i>promise</i>.<a name=137:18></a> What is the promise?<a name=137:19></a> Some inquire.<a name=137:20></a> What is the unspeakable free gift?<a name=137:21></a> It is better to let it stand as it is and rest in it.<a name=137:22></a> It is an unspeakable free gift of God, for who can compass the extent of the unspeakable free gift of God?<a name=137:23></a> It is better to live in it.<a name=137:24></a> That is the idea; for the dispensation is impregnated with the idea of an unspeakable free gift, and that must entail the Spirit.<a name=137:25></a> There is the gift of the Son for us, and the gift of the Spirit to us The one enhances the other, so to speak, and together you have the fulness of divine giving.<a name=137:26></a> What a weight of glory rests upon us as having the Spirit of God!<a name=137:27></a>

		So the Lord here says, "<i>Ye</i> are witnesses"; you know these things, but He adds in effect.<a name=138:1></a> Do not attempt to speak about them until the promise of the Father comes upon you.<a name=138:2></a> What could any one of us do apart from the Spirit of God?<a name=138:3></a> Even although the disciples were witnesses of the most marvellous powers, yea, the very vessels of those powers, yet the Lord would not allow them to speak of them until they received the promise of the Father.<a name=138:4></a> So the testimony is to be presented in the power of the Spirit of God.<a name=138:5></a> There is no other way.<a name=138:6></a> Anyone attempting witness apart from the power of the Spirit of God, discredits the thing that he presents.<a name=138:7></a> Even a Peter, a James, or a John, although having been on the mount of transfiguration, could not preach the gospel rightly without the Spirit of God.<a name=138:8></a>

		So that He says, "Tarry ye in the city", meaning that it is not now a question of going a journey, as in Matthew; not a question here of the exercise of the servant to get his 'word', but what comes in sovereignly.<a name=138:9></a> We can reckon on this, it is a question of promise.<a name=138:10></a> I have not got to work for something that is promised me; it is a question of promise, and what a promise!<a name=138:11></a> "The promise of my Father", He says, that is to come <i>upon</i> you; and then, "But do ye remain in the city till ye be clothed with power from on high".<a name=138:12></a> There are the two thoughts, the promise of the Father bringing in all that the Father is in grace; and then the power from on high, that is, moral elevation.<a name=138:13></a> Literal elevation to be sure, but it is moral elevation here also; it is "from on <i>high</i>".<a name=138:14></a> Hence the witnesses do not descend to the level of man, or the world, in their testimony.<a name=138:15></a>

		Then the word here is 'clothed', "till ye be clothed".<a name=138:16></a> We were speaking about the Lord's clothes today, what was said being very suggestive.<a name=138:17></a> Clothes do not convey the idea of acts of power.<a name=138:18></a> That is, a man acts by his hands, and so on; the hands are the symbol of a man's power to do things; but when curative effects are seen through

		My wish in regard of this meeting is to help more particularly those who are younger among us.<a name=140:1></a> We have not especially thought of them in our meetings, for this has not been a young people's conference.<a name=140:2></a> It had all grades in the family of God in view; for John, who is the family man, grades the saints fathers, young men and children, and these grades should be in mind in ministry.<a name=140:3></a> It is the last grade that I have in mind at this time, and for this reason I have selected Romans, which is particularly calculated to meet the needs of young believers.<a name=140:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My thought is to speak of the Holy Spirit as seen in this epistle; and what one would say to all, and especially to young believers, is that the best Friend we have on earth is the Spirit of God, answering to what is in heaven; for what is there is here in principle; we can never limit a divine Person.<a name=140:5></a> So that in the presence of the Holy Spirit here we have, as I said, our best Friend on earth.<a name=140:6></a> It is important that He should be regarded in a personal way, that believers should become acquainted with the Holy Spirit.<a name=140:7></a> The Lord in His communications of love to His own at the supper table in Jerusalem, ere He died, spoke much of the Spirit as another comforter; One who, by the term He uses, was to be understood as taking charge of the affairs of the saints here.<a name=140:8></a> He spoke of Him as the Spirit of truth, sent by the Father in answer to His begging for Him; He spoke of Him as sent forth in the Son's name by the Father; He spoke of Him as proceeding forth from with the Father (meaning that He had perfect first hand knowledge of the Father's thoughts about the Son; the Son being the subject of testimony, the Spirit should bear witness of Him); and then.<a name=140:9></a> He should send Him Himself; and as the Spirit of truth comes.<a name=140:10></a> He brings into this world a demonstration of righteousness, and of sin, and of judgment.<a name=140:11></a> You see,

		therefore, a divine Person is here, and His functions are in relation to the saints.<a name=141:1></a> He is <i>another</i> Comforter.<a name=141:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to shew how He operates, as seen in this epistle, and first in regard to <i>the hearts</i> of believers.<a name=141:3></a> He is presented indeed earlier in relation to the Lord Himself as "the Spirit of holiness"; reminding us that what accompanies the gospel is the Spirit of holiness.<a name=141:4></a> He is also presented as the Spirit of life; the Spirit of God; the Spirit of adoption.<a name=141:5></a> All these designations are in relation to our souls- experience.<a name=141:6></a> A profitable address might be given on each of those designations; but I just mention them now, so that you may have in view the comprehensiveness of the Spirit's functions and relations, as presented in this fundamental epistle.<a name=141:7></a> I say fundamental, because it is well to be grounded in the foundations; so that young people may have a basis for a superstructure which God will not fail to rear.<a name=141:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I wish to speak about the Holy Spirit in relation to our <i>hearts</i>.<a name=141:9></a> The heart is a sphere in which you would expect Him to be especially interested, for God would secure His people through their hearts; through their intelligence, of course, but the highest intelligence is through the eyes of the heart; die spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of God is through the "eyes of your heart", (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:18">Ephesians  1:18</a>).<a name=141:10></a> Hence the importance of recognising this first service of the Spirit.<a name=141:11></a> He knows that the end in view in the gospel is a heart matter; and so, in the type in Exodus that is what God would stress in speaking to His people.<a name=141:12></a> He says, "I have borne you on eagles- wings and brought you to myself", (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#19:4">Exodus  19:4</a>).<a name=141:13></a> This was after they had murmured.<a name=141:14></a> Jitter, they had complained after they had talked about going back into Egypt; God knowing well our proclivities and how the things of the world cling to us even after our conversions, delivers out of them, bearing us on eagles- wings to Himself.<a name=141:15></a> That is what marks His early dealings with the people after they had passed through the Red Sea, after

		they had sung of His victory.<a name=142:1></a> One complaint after another, but no reproofs, no punitive action on the part of God.<a name=142:2></a> It was the reign of grace; it was the era of grace.<a name=142:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, in answer to their demand for water in their murmurings.<a name=142:4></a> God said to Moses, "Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock".<a name=142:5></a> That is the idea.<a name=142:6></a> Instead of smiting the people, the rock was smitten; and "the rock was the Christ".<a name=142:7></a> That touches the heart; it is intended to touch the heart; that He was smitten instead of me when I deserved it; when I had shewn by my wayward, rebellious and murmuring spirit that I deserved it, Christ was smitten.<a name=142:8></a> He was "stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted", as we read.<a name=142:9></a> So that the Holy Spirit comes in type and the water flowed in order that the people might have <i>another state</i>.<a name=142:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then immediately Amalek attacks them, and the whole divine system, we may say, is engaged to give victory to the believer; for that is the idea.<a name=142:11></a> Moses and Aaron and Hur and Joshua, are all actively engaged, so that the believer, as having the Holy Spirit, should prove His power.<a name=142:12></a> The intercession of Christ on high in Moses, and the skill of Christ as a Warrior in Joshua, are brought into action, so that the beginnings of the believer, as possessed of the Spirit, should be marked by victory; that the young believer should get a <i>taste</i> of it, and as he gets a taste, the thing will increase.<a name=142:13></a> That is to say, what began in the type in (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#17">Exodus  17</a>) ended in Joshua, in the people being set in possession of the land.<a name=142:14></a> It was the same power, but in increased measure; and it is continually increasing, for there is no limit.<a name=142:15></a> It is a divine power here, given without measure.<a name=142:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a question, therefore, of capacity in the believer, and so in the type after this God says.<a name=142:17></a> Now I want you to be for Me, a chosen, priestly nation.<a name=142:18></a> He would have them for Himself, for Jehovah's inheritance is His people; and that elevates the believer at once, for he is of

		Philippians speaks of excellency, "That ye may judge of and approve the things that are more excellent".<a name=143:24></a> It is a fine habit.<a name=143:25></a> God commends His love to us, "in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us".<a name=143:26></a>

		But that is not enough.<a name=144:1></a> He intends that what He has commended should become resident in our hearts, and the Holy Spirit serves in that connection.<a name=144:2></a> He sheds abroad, says the apostle, the love of God in our hearts.<a name=144:3></a> Now this is most important for every young person, and for all of us, to have the consciousness of the love of God actually shed abroad in our hearts by the Spirit; a transaction by the Spirit of God; not simply coming to us, taking possession of us, sealing us, but bringing in this thing into our hearts, the love of God.<a name=144:4></a>

		Now I pass on to chapter 8, a chapter, thank God, much read among us, and I hope understood; so that I do So intend to go into the details of the teaching relative to the Spirit, only that I would say that it answers in the types to (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21">Numbers  21</a>) and what follows.<a name=144:5></a> It is an experience well nigh forty years after that of which I have spoken.<a name=144:6></a> But it is not contemplated that this should be the case with us.<a name=144:7></a> It is well, however, to note the number of years that elapsed between Horeb and Beer, the well of which it is said, "Gather the people together, and I will give them water".<a name=144:8></a> It is well to note that; so that we might not be 'objective', merely, in our apprehension of the truth; but that we may see that while the objective side is presented to us in the gospel, to be received on the principle of faith, the Holy Spirit in the Scriptures would teach us that a time -- however short or long -- elapses between that and the full formation in us that corresponds with it.<a name=144:9></a> That as God worked on the principle of time in (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>), so He works on the principle of time in our souls; for we are still in time.<a name=144:10></a> Hence we find in Genesis that life does not appear till the third day.<a name=144:11></a> We have light on the first day; and then we have the heavens on the second day, all of which is what I may call objective; that is, what is <i>presented</i> to me, something outside of me, but which is intended to affect me and govern me.<a name=144:12></a>

		So in chapter 14, after the apostle speaks about the authorities, "the powers that be" for whom we pray and whom God uses, he speaks about the kingdom of God; that is <i>direct</i> from Him.<a name=151:5></a> The kingdom of God is that in which God rules directly.<a name=151:6></a> The kingdoms of this world God uses, but He governs through them indirectly.<a name=151:7></a> Hence, the kingdom of God is brought in in chapter 14 over against meat and drink.<a name=151:8></a> By going in for the things that are common to men, that the flesh goes after, by going in for them without control, without spiritual intelligence, we may destroy the work of God.<a name=151:9></a> That is a serious matter; the work of God is most precious, and therefore 'the weak brother' must be handled carefully.<a name=151:10></a> But I cannot go into that; I only wish to shew you that the kingdom of God is over against these natural things, and that it is "righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit".<a name=151:11></a>

		J.T.<a name=164:10></a> Well, you see how the apostle here is praying for the Colossians, that they might "be filled with the full knowledge of his will".<a name=164:11></a> The work of God goes on all the time with us, unless our wills begin to act.<a name=164:12></a> Then, of course, it stops, but normally it goes on in relation to what is presented to us objectively; in relation to whatever pattern God is working on.<a name=164:13></a> If He is working in relation to the heavenly, the work proceeds on those lines, and it is for the ministers to understand that; that as Paul insists they are <i>working with God</i>.<a name=164:14></a>

		J.T.<a name=165:3></a> Exactly.<a name=165:4></a> Of course a great deal could be said as to the accompanying things, in the initial effect of the work of God; but the apostle is concerned about workmanship, to "present every man perfect in Christ".<a name=165:5></a> Mary of Bethany sat at the Lord's feet, and I believe that is a principle.<a name=165:6></a> Unless He is definitely before the believers, gifts in the exercise of the service are sure to be unduly distinctive in their minds; and that is where the Colossian danger lay.<a name=165:7></a> The Corinthians were grossly occupied with the persons that ministered, or professed to minister; they had their own preferences; they were comparing this one with that one, and so forth.<a name=165:8></a> The Colossians were not so gross as that, but there was this danger; the apostle is anxious that no man should deceive or mislead them.<a name=165:9></a> It is a danger, that lurks always where we are disposed to take certain ones as references in the ministry.<a name=165:10></a>
	</div>

		J.T.<a name=167:4></a> That leads to the full thought; it is "every man"; the full end is collective, as in Ephesians.<a name=167:5></a> In Colossians it is presented as the burden of the prayer of Epaphras <i>standing</i> "perfect and complete in <i>all</i> the will of God".<a name=167:6></a> The prayer of the apostle, chapter 1:9 - 11, is in full keeping with this.<a name=167:7></a> I think the two pillars in the front of the temple would perhaps help.<a name=167:8></a> In those two pillars there was a presentation of what God would effect.<a name=167:9></a> They were beautifully ornamented.<a name=167:10></a> In 1 Kings you have the separate heights of the pillars; but in 2 Chronicles their total height, and I suppose the latter would mean the fulness of the divine thought.<a name=167:11></a> You may reach the height of one, so to speak, but to get to the height of the <i>two</i>, you reach completeness.<a name=167:12></a> Obviously the idea is to represent what God can effect; so in Peter and John at the gate of the temple you have what God can effect in men like ourselves, so that attention is called to <i>them</i> there: "Look on us".<a name=167:13></a> There was something there representative of God; it was not Christ personally; but it was enough to call the man's attention to, and he was healed, brought into power in that action, and "held Peter and John".<a name=167:14></a> That was an immense start, but he would go on; he <i>continued</i> with them.<a name=167:15></a> God shews what He can do; not only what is effected in Christ personally, but what He can effect in men like ourselves.<a name=167:16></a> That is the idea of ministry.<a name=167:17></a> Being myself the thing I present, I affect accordingly those who listen to me; and it leads them on to the full thought; for the great objective is the "full grown man".<a name=167:18></a> Alongside of those pillars there was spiritually the means of bringing others into what they set forth, in the altar, the sea, and the laver.<a name=167:19></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=176:1></a> In this meeting we may see the relation between verse 15 of chapter 1, Christ the "image of the invisible God", and verse 10 of chapter 3, in which the new man is said to be "renewed into full knowledge according to the image of him that has created him".<a name=176:2></a> Pursuant to what was said this morning about the divine impress being on all, it may be remarked that the Colossians evidently had reached the <i>life</i> stage, that is, life in a practical, substantial sense, and the object, among other things, in the epistle is to place the divine impress on that.<a name=176:3></a> The presence of life is indicated in the fact that they had love for "all the saints" and "love in the Spirit".<a name=176:4></a> The carrying of the stone in (<a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#4">Joshua  4</a>) by a representative of each tribe would point to this; they were in life, and were set down in relation to one another at Gilgal, but the divine impress was to be worked out, and the stones were to be a memorial.<a name=176:5></a> Their children should ask them what they meant.<a name=176:6></a> "What mean <i>ye</i> by these stones?<a name=176:7></a>" that is the first question; the second question is, "What mean these stones?<a name=176:8></a>" First it is, "What mean ye by these stones?<a name=176:9></a>" as if the onus is put upon the saints to convey the meaning.<a name=176:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have already seen the enlargement given in (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1">Colossians  1</a>) to the Person of Christ, and His headships; and then the ministries of Paul are evidently to work those features out in us, on the principle of divine representation.<a name=176:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.H.<a name=176:12></a> I was struck with what you have drawn attention to, first, of Christ Himself being the image of the invisible God, and then the reference in chapter 3 to the new man as "renewed into full knowledge according to the image of him that has created him".<a name=176:13></a> Is the thought that that image is transferred to the believer?<a name=176:14></a>

		suggestive of what is young or fresh; so that the idea of image is to be impressed on fresh young life, but in the way of knowledge renewal of knowledge.<a name=177:1></a> The idea of renewal, "renewed into full knowledge", is that it is to be new in the sense of being different from what the Greek or the ceremonialist would have in mind.<a name=177:2></a> Colossians has in mind the freshness and energy of life in the saints as set in relation to one another; not necessarily gathered together, but set in relation to one another, as indicated in the twelve stones; that the "image of him that created him" should be in the new man.<a name=177:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		H.H.<a name=177:4></a> Would you say in regard of Colossians generally that it does not suppose the saints as convened?<a name=177:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=177:6></a> That is not the point of view.<a name=177:7></a> It is our being united in life, whether we are convened or not.<a name=177:8></a> The apostle speaks of the 'order' that marked them, and this would allude to them as gathered together.<a name=177:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=177:12></a> Yes; and that would fit in with present current conditions.<a name=177:13></a> There is a good deal of energy, but we need to be representative of God.<a name=177:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=177:18></a> I think so.<a name=177:19></a> Colossians is dealing with the saints as a whole, although the saints at Colosse were immediately in view; but what I have remarked is only to indicate what we may see.<a name=177:20></a> I think we ought specially to notice the headships of Christ in chapter 1 and the ministries of Paul; because these come in with peculiar weight in Colossians.<a name=177:21></a> It is not arbitrary, but more that they are presented in their own weight.<a name=177:22></a> The headship of Christ in creation is the effect of His own power then His headship of the church through redemption; and then His being here as an instrumentality for the Godhead His deity asserted in that the fulness dwelt there;

		H.E.<a name=178:10></a>S.<a name=178:11></a> Are the two thoughts of image referred to here somewhat on the line of the gospel and epistle of John?<a name=178:12></a> In the gospel it is, "Which thing is true in him", and in the epistle, "Which thing is true .<a name=178:13></a>.<a name=178:14></a>.<a name=178:15></a> in you".<a name=178:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=178:17></a> Yes.<a name=178:18></a> The epistle corresponds because it is a question of what is true in us.<a name=178:19></a> It is what the life is and whereat is; it is in Christ it is seen.<a name=178:20></a> The subject really is life in that epistle; but here, whilst life is brought in, it is rather as that on which God through Christ can place his impress which is another line.<a name=178:21></a> Colossians has heaven in view; our hope is laid up there Christ is in us, the hope of glory.<a name=178:22></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=181:9></a> Yes; she is a good illustration of it, so that great care is taken that it should be stripped of everything that would becloud it; and hence the great care in the opening of Joshua in regard to the position in Canaan, so that there should not be a taint from all that preceded, nor anything that should becloud the thing that was there, but that it should be there in its own intrinsic worth.<a name=181:10></a> Hence you get, as I said, the evidence of life in the carrying up of the stones and placing them together; and there was the idea of 'victuals'; food is needed.<a name=181:11></a> It is a time when there is great need of sustenance from suitable food; as was said with regard to the little girl, something should be given her to eat.<a name=181:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then you have the stopping of one kind of food and the introduction of another; that is, the transition from the manna to the heavenly food.<a name=181:13></a> It is a delicate position because it is a change of food, as in the bringing up of a child, and everything is reckoned carefully so that the life according to God should be in the land.<a name=181:14></a> Rahab was already there.<a name=181:15></a> She had not come under the influence of the ministry of Moses, but she had heard of what Jehovah did at the Red sea that is, in the death and resurrection of Christ; and of what they did, which points to the power of the Spirit of God in the saints.<a name=181:16></a>

		She had heard about those things, and she knew the effect of the tidings on all the inhabitants of Canaan was that they were as dead men.<a name=182:1></a> That is an evidence of something by itself; and faith is attributed to her in Hebrews, after being attributed to Israel as to the passage of the Red sea.<a name=182:2></a> "By faith they passed through the Red sea", and now faith is in the land in a person that had not come under the influence of Moses.<a name=182:3></a> Then you have the idea of food, first the victuals and then the change of food.<a name=182:4></a> Then we have the circumcision, six hundred thousand or more all circumcised at once; that is to say, you are brought down to a state of weakness, for the flesh profits nothing.<a name=182:5></a> That is the position here.<a name=182:6></a> There is thus room for the power of God to act.<a name=182:7></a>

		So, in coming into our own realm, the creation of (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>), the creation as we are in it, we have the thought introduced in a very familiar and simple manner, in Abraham and others who are said to be God's anointed ones.<a name=200:10></a> Even in those early days what was being done bore the divine stamp.<a name=200:11></a> God said He reproved kings on account of His anointed ones, shewing what they were to Him: "Touch not mine anointed ones", (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#105:15">Psalm  105:15</a>).<a name=200:12></a> They were moving under God, and God had an obvious

	<div class="paragraph">
		I am speaking very simply, dear brethren, because I am impressed with this, that God would put dignity and power upon His people in dealing with men in this world.<a name=201:4></a> He has a hand in our movement's with the result that there is a constant rise in power and dignity in the saints before the eyes of those with whom they have to do immediately.<a name=201:5></a> So that as you see with Abraham, he could rebuke the king of the Philistines.<a name=201:6></a> So with Isaac.<a name=201:7></a> They were few and of small account in this world, but there was something that marked them off from men, and caused a gradual rise in power and dignity, so that they did not have to lend their shoulders to servitude; they were not brought under the power of this world, there was a superiority about them that lifted them above the current of the world.<a name=201:8></a> So that Isaac was able to speak on more than equal terms with the Philistine king, although he brought the general of his army and his friend with him, as an evidence of military power and social influence; but it was not enough to overwhelm Isaac.<a name=201:9></a> And then in Jacob you see the same thing; he stands before Pharaoh and blesses him.<a name=201:10></a> The Holy Spirit, commenting upon a similar occurrence, says that "the less is blessed of the better", (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#7:7">Hebrews  7:7</a>).<a name=201:11></a>

		Now what comes out is that all this in Genesis leads up to a great position: Joseph is a fruitful bough by a well, and the branches run over the wall, and "from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel", chapter 49.<a name=201:12></a>

		That is the position in Genesis, Then in the typical books that follow you have the ministry or administration of it, and the way it is to be diffused and to reach men; that is the principle.<a name=202:1></a> So you have the anointing of Aaron and the anointing of the tabernacle and its utensils, with all that pertained to it, for God intends to shine out and to operate, and to shew Himself in a domain dignified by the anointing.<a name=202:2></a> He has to say to every part of it; no other rights are recognised there.<a name=202:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that is to reflect on our present position; there are no rights to be asserted among us, save God's rights.<a name=202:4></a> The anointing makes the position too dignified to admit of any human assertion of rights.<a name=202:5></a> God puts in His claim in the most positive manner in the anointing, so that in the tabernacle and its utensils anointed you get what typically represents the heavens and the earth; and then Aaron is anointed in relation to that, and you have a domain in which God's rights are asserted and maintained.<a name=202:6></a> The One who ministers there serves in the sympathy that belongs to the divine nature; for in.<a name=202:7></a> Aaron it is a question of the manhood and priesthood of Christ.<a name=202:8></a> All that God <i>is</i>, embodied in a Man, in order that what God is may be brought in in the most sympathetic manner in that whole domain; and that God Himself may be served in it.<a name=202:9></a>

		Now you see what Exodus and Leviticus denote what a scene is presented!<a name=202:10></a> And what <i>a</i> Person is anointed in that scene!<a name=202:11></a> So that we have the rights of God in every detail asserted in the priest, but in the most sympathetic manner, for they are not arbitrary.<a name=202:12></a> What can be better for us, dear brethren, than the rights of God?<a name=202:13></a> The more they are asserted the better; for what are they today but His, rights in grace, or rather in mercy?<a name=202:14></a> It is a question of His right to be merciful and gracious, and the more we admit these rights, both in ourselves severally and in the whole domain in which God is operating, the happier and richer we shall be.<a name=202:15></a>

		Now I want to come to 2 Corinthians, because the anointing is specially mentioned there.<a name=203:1></a> It is not formally mentioned in the first epistle, though it is involved in the expression "the Christ" in chapter 12; but not as implying that the Corinthians were marked by it, for they were not; they were marked by the very opposite.<a name=203:2></a> Although having the Holy Spirit, and as in that sense anointed, they were marked by man's doings and sayings and party spirit, which is the very opposite of the anointing.<a name=203:3></a> That is simply the world, and walking according to men, and is, I need not say, degrading.<a name=203:4></a> But still, there it stands, "As the body is one and has many members .<a name=203:5></a>.<a name=203:6></a>.<a name=203:7></a> so also is the Christ", "the Christ" alluding to the saints as anointed as in relation to Christ, but it is not formally applied to the Corinthians.<a name=203:8></a> But in the second letter it is implied, for they are included, as I understand, in the idea with the apostle himself: "He which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God".<a name=203:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, dear brethren, I wish to seek to make clear the import of that statement, appearing as it does in the second letter, which is based on a certain effect in recovery from the first letter.<a name=203:10></a> It indicates that the anointing refers to something of God in the person anointed; that it is intended to enable us in a dignified positive way to convey to others what we are enjoying.<a name=203:11></a> If God has saved me, has justified me, has given His Spirit to me, has brought me into the joy of the kingdom, "righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit", then I say.<a name=203:12></a> Well, I can speak of that, and indeed I should; but the anointing means that I have power to speak of it effectively, that I can speak of it rightly, and in force, so that it affects others.<a name=203:13></a> It is not a matter of incidental comment, but the thing impresses you, and you are enabled to speak of it effectively.<a name=203:14></a> But, as I said, we have to bear in mind that the anointing is in the second letter to the Corinthians, not in the first.<a name=203:15></a> Not that it could

		not be spoken of in the first in abstract way, but it is spoken of in the second in a positive way, and what follows is that He has sealed us and given us the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.<a name=204:1></a> Underneath the anointing is the sealing, the fact that you belong to God, that God had put a stamp on you, that you are His; He has right to you.<a name=204:2></a> But then, what have you got?<a name=204:3></a> Well, you have got in your heart the earnest of the Spirit that is something.<a name=204:4></a> And there I may liken you to Jacob in Bethel, for in this respect we may read these epistles into (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#28">Genesis  28</a>).<a name=204:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The idea of the anointing was already there; Abraham was one of the "anointed ones".<a name=204:6></a> (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#105">Psalm  105</a>), and that has to be borne in mind if we are to understand aright Jacob's action in pouring oil on the stone.<a name=204:7></a> It was but very little, the stone was hard, denoting hard circumstances; it was his own selection, he set it up himself; it was one of the stones of the place, and he took it and used it for a pillow.<a name=204:8></a> But you see there was something there, something had come into Jacob's soul that had never, been there before.<a name=204:9></a> I cannot dwell on it; you all know the chapter; but it is so important for young people to lay hold of the idea of something coming into the soul, changing the whole texture of the person.<a name=204:10></a> Jacob was trammelled as yet by much of the flesh and nature, selfishness and natural ambitions, and other things, but there was something, perhaps indefinable by himself, which was there, and he was able definitely to take that stone and set it up and pour oil on it; there was spiritual intelligence and purpose in that action.<a name=204:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now to shew us the bearing of the anointing, dear brethren, in the next chapter you see the energy, of the man on behalf of others.<a name=204:12></a> He went his way to Haran, and looked around and saw a well, and three flocks of sheep lying there.<a name=204:13></a> I only touch on that; I want to shew you that the anointing of the stone spiritually alluded to Jacob himself, and was to shew itself in his energy; he

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have not far to go for objects of affection.<a name=205:9></a> As soon as Rachel arrived Jacob said, "My brethren, whence be ye?<a name=205:10></a> And they said.<a name=205:11></a> Of Haran are we", and they knew Laban.<a name=205:12></a> Earlier Jacob could speak of the time of day, and that the flocks should be watered, but he did not do it; that is to say, he could speak of the need of things being done without doing them, but as soon as an object for his affections appeared, he rolled away the stone and watered the flock.<a name=205:13></a> He is a type of Christ.<a name=205:14></a> What he did is typically the product of heaven brought down, and brought within the range of the youngest believer to serve by love.<a name=205:15></a> The greatest power in the whole universe is love; and it begins in a small way; if you have a brother or a sister an object for your affection near you, you can serve by love.<a name=205:16></a> Jacob rolled away the stone without any apparent difficulty.<a name=205:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But as he came back to Bethel twenty years later, he set up "a pillar of stone"; the idea is increased in his mind.<a name=205:18></a> That is why I am connecting this passage in Genesis with 2 Corinthians; it is very much like Jacob's second visit to Bethel.<a name=205:19></a> In this letter we have the new covenant.<a name=205:20></a> The apostle discerned a change in their state; self judgment had taken effect.<a name=205:21></a> So he is able to open up to them the love of God which is in Christ Jesus, the new covenant, and then the ministry of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So that the life of a person truly in the good of reconciliation is a life for the pleasure of God.<a name=206:8></a> It is a most practical thing.<a name=206:9></a> God has refreshment in every little bit of service rendered by a person who is truly in the good of reconciliation.<a name=206:10></a> Hence in (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#35">Genesis  35</a>) Jacob sets up a pillar of stone; not now simply a stone that had been his pillow, or a mere piece of stone, but "a pillar of stone".<a name=206:11></a> The idea of a pillar is more permanent; and the substance of this is stone, it is something to remain; and Jacob is conscious in setting it up that he has been pleasing to God.<a name=206:12></a> And how pleasing?<a name=206:13></a> God came down and spoke to him, standing by him, not at a distance as before, and Jacob so revered the spot that he set up a pillar there, and poured a drink offering upon it; that is why I linked it with 2 Corinthians, for there is no doubt that spiritually the stone pillar was there.<a name=206:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I will come back to that in relation to the passage read in Luke, but I wish to shew how this principle is applied to our education, and that is what John dwells upon.<a name=207:8></a> The anointing here implies more than simply oil poured on, it is a sort of rubbing in.<a name=207:9></a> That is what we need; many of us take things on too lightly when it is a question of education, and that particularly applies to the young; but there is this thing that God, as it were, rubs in, so as to enable us to shut out all man's teaching.<a name=207:10></a> I do not mean the teaching that is necessary for ordinary service or to earn a livelihood, because for these things we need a certain education; but I am speaking of what relates to God, and of the superiority of the teaching, of what is here called 'the anointing', 'the unction'.<a name=207:11></a> It is received from the Holy One.<a name=207:12></a> It is not called the Spirit; it is something known, as received.<a name=207:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the question is, dear brethren, as to the use of it the fathers, but to the little ones in John's family.<a name=207:14></a> The apostle addresses us as a class, yourselves, a very suggestive expression!<a name=207:15></a> I think the Lord's supper brings that about; and as to this, one would speak specially to any one who is not a partaker of the Lord's supper.<a name=207:16></a> 'Yourselves', as used here, is a very precious word, it refers to a special class of people.<a name=207:17></a> The Lord's supper

		Now this is a most practical thing, especially for our dear young brothers and sisters, that they might be preserved in the sense of what they have received, as receiving the Holy Spirit and using it, in their understanding of things, in their communications in regard of divine things.<a name=208:18></a> It is thus that we get, as I may say, the tabernacle anointed however you look at it, we have this thing <i>ingrained</i> in us, so that there is a rigid exclusion of man's influence and man's teaching and man's thoughts.<a name=208:19></a> We are kept together thus, dear brethren, in holy dignity as in intelligence, for in this passage it is a question of spiritual intelligence.<a name=208:20></a> We have received the unction from the Holy One, so that we are kept together, a holy circle in a positive way by the anointing.<a name=208:21></a> There is a dignity about all our communications with one another,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish now to shew you how this appears in perfection in the Lord Jesus, because God would have us to see the perfection of everything, and this is always in Christ.<a name=209:3></a> God would bring us to that level in everything.<a name=209:4></a> But I am speaking for the moment of the anointing, and would have in mind more particularly now those of us who are older and who are specially laying ourselves out for the service of the Lord and His people; that we may see how the thing is to be carried on in correspondence with Christ.<a name=209:5></a> What you find in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#3">Luke  3</a>is that as the Holy Spirit comes down on the Lord Jesus, it is in a bodily form as a dove, and there is the Father's voice to Him, "Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased".<a name=209:6></a> What I have been saying is verified in this; there was something there to be anointed an infinite something, but <i>in man</i>; the Father was pleased with it, heaven was pleased with it.<a name=209:7></a> As He came up out of the water and He was praying, a dependent Man, heaven was opened, and the Holy Spirit came down in the form of a dove and abode on Him.<a name=209:8></a> Then the Father's voice indicated His pleasure in what was there: "In thee I have found my delight".<a name=209:9></a> One dwells on that with peculiar restfulness, on what was there, so well known to heaven, and, alas!<a name=209:10></a> So little known to men.<a name=209:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then it says, "Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age"; I wish you to take notice of that, it is what He began <i>to be</i>; the service of God in the anointing is to be in those who are fully matured; that is in view, levitical maturity.<a name=209:12></a> It is not a mere historical fact that He was just that number of years old, but He "began to be about thirty years of age".<a name=209:13></a> Now you see the idea in

		The flesh is repudiated, the anointing is enough; and so I yield to the Spirit.<a name=211:1></a> The Lord is "led by the Spirit in the wilderness".<a name=211:2></a> That is another thing; He is entirely now in the hands of the Spirit, and that is really the full thought in the service of God.<a name=211:3></a> He was "led by the Spirit in the wilderness", and He was tempted and came out victorious He overcame.<a name=211:4></a> Then He returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee and came to Nazareth, where He was brought up.<a name=211:5></a> You see He waits until He comes into the circumstances in which He was brought up; circumstances which are the most testing for us, for our relatives know us best, and we are not likely to get any help from them unless they are spiritual.<a name=211:6></a> That is a warning.<a name=211:7></a> Nature is utterly profitless and will not stand by you; your father, mother, or brother will fail you on this line; it cannot be trusted.<a name=211:8></a> So our relatives become the test, for they know us, and unless they are truly in the testimony they will be critical, they will oppose, and the opposition will be constant.<a name=211:9></a>

		And so in His service the Lord reaches Nazareth, where He was brought up, and He enters into the synagogue and stands up to read the scripture which speaks of His anointing.<a name=211:10></a> The Holy Spirit loves to portray the full position of the anointing in this passage.<a name=211:11></a> It is "Luke, the beloved physician", who is used of the Spirit of God to present to us this unique setting out of the anointing in the perfect Servant.<a name=211:12></a> And so we have the position; He <i>stands up</i>, to read, and He <i>finds</i> the scripture.<a name=211:13></a> Then as He rolled up the book and delivered it to the attendant, He sat down.<a name=211:14></a> Then He began to speak, saying, "This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears".<a name=211:15></a>

		I am thinking, dear brethren, of <i>willingness</i> in the saints, willingness to do the will of God.<a name=213:1></a> It will be remembered that the Lord speaks in spirit in the Song of Solomon of the chariots of His <i>willing</i> people, and, it will be remembered, too, that in 2 Corinthians the apostle Paul speaks about willingness, and that, according to this willingness or readiness, "a man is accepted according to what he may have".<a name=213:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I was thinking of that as a basis for a word at this time; for we are, although believers, prone, to be unwilling.<a name=213:3></a> It is said of the elder brother in the parable, that he would <i>not</i> go in (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15">Luke  15</a>).<a name=213:4></a> God would induce willingness and put us at the very outset in the way of it, by setting before us the very best things by way of attraction for it is well to habituate ourselves to it initially, and God makes this easy, so to speak, for the young believer, in affording him so much to attract.<a name=213:5></a> As the Lord says, "My yoke is easy, and my burden is light".<a name=213:6></a> And so, as taking the people out of Egypt, God makes the way as easy as possible.<a name=213:7></a> He led them not in the way of the Philistines lest they should see war, and resented not any of their murmurings or complaints until they reached the great source of supply, that is, the mount of God.<a name=213:8></a> After that, as He opens up the infinite store house of His resources to them, at least typically.<a name=213:9></a> He formulates His will, and then begins discipline -- for it is not love to suffer our wills.<a name=213:10></a> It would not be love for God to suffer our wills, or the growth of the flesh, even in the sphere of grace: but He

		allows the young believer much latitude -- not to sin, of course -- there is never any latitude or excuse for that -- but in the type, there is very great consideration for the youthful believer so that he should not be discouraged at the beginning, but should see that the will of God is good and that it is perfect.<a name=214:1></a> It is first good, then perfect.<a name=214:2></a> He is to prove that, and a period under the influence of grace will indicate to us that the will of God is <i>good</i> and perfect, so that we habituate ourselves to obedience, resigning ourselves to it.<a name=214:3></a> As it is said: "Present your bodies a living sacrifice .<a name=214:4></a>.<a name=214:5></a>.<a name=214:6></a> which is your reasonable service".<a name=214:7></a> We begin to prove this, that the way is delightsome.<a name=214:8></a> And then God opens up His storehouse of resources, so that, as the rigours of the wilderness way for there are rigours and hardships -- begin, we are already accustomed to drawing upon the resources that God has opened up to us.<a name=214:9></a>

		So I ventured to read in Philippians, a book that may be likened to the book of Psalms, only on a higher plane: a book that should be read even from the beginning of the believer's pathway.<a name=214:10></a> It is a book of experience.<a name=214:11></a> The Psalms are that, too, but the epistle to the Philippians is experience on a higher plane and much more compressed.<a name=214:12></a> In no life have we got compression as in the life of Jesus, and this epistle touches on that life, from the moment of His decision to empty Himself, being in the form of God, from that moment until the cross, yea, the exaltation, we have the life of Jesus in a few short verses.<a name=214:13></a> It is infinity put into a few verses, as I might say, but enough to give us an inlet into <i>that life</i>.<a name=214:14></a> A day of that life was more in the divine account than a millennium of a life like mine.<a name=214:15></a> Contrast the life of Methuselah 969 years, and the life of Jesus!<a name=214:16></a> The life of Jesus was, in point of time, but a very small part of the life of Methuselah; but the one was attenuated so that the Holy Spirit says nothing beyond the years.<a name=214:17></a>

		The life of Enoch was three hundred years after he begat a son; Methuselah, lived all these three hundred years, but the Holy Spirit lights on nothing as reflecting the life of his father.<a name=215:1></a> A long life, nearly three times that of his father, but his father's life was "with God" -- he "walked with God"; but Methuselah's life was featureless.<a name=215:2></a> We do not want that; we want our lives filled with; the will of God; and not the will of God in a perfunctory sort of way, but for His pleasure.<a name=215:3></a> Our wills enter into it, so that our lives are full, if need be compressed, for God reckons by days and by millenniums.<a name=215:4></a> One "day is with the Lord as a thousand years", but that must be a day into which much enters; it cannot be a day barren of results for Him.<a name=215:5></a> God never intended any day to be, barren of results for Him.<a name=215:6></a> So, if a day in His mind be like a thousand years, what a day it must be how full!<a name=215:7></a> Who can write the history of such a day?<a name=215:8></a> No one but God.<a name=215:9></a> And it is of such days, beloved, that the life of Jesus was made up; days so full of delight for God, of the maintenance of the will of God, of pleasure to Him, that every moment of every day, as well as every day of every year, was filled up thus.<a name=215:10></a> And what must be "the <i>day</i> of eternity"?<a name=215:11></a> The idea is of what is compassable -- but compassable by whom?<a name=215:12></a> Who can take it in, beloved, but God?<a name=215:13></a> He can take it in.<a name=215:14></a> As He alone can take in the life of Jesus in its fulness, so He takes in eternity.<a name=215:15></a> He 'inhabits' it.<a name=215:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, what I have said will convey to you what is in my mind, and my desire is that we should all take into account willingness; that our lives may not be featureless, that they may not be uneventful in the eyes of heaven; that we may not be passed over as unworthy of notice; that the divine eye may see something that it can take account of and name as distinctive of each of us; that our lives, in other words, may be worth recording.<a name=215:17></a> Our names are recorded, true enough, in the book of life as believers; but there is also the question of our <i>lives</i>.<a name=215:18></a>

		Do you think that it is too much to regard God as recording the events of our lives?<a name=216:1></a> Not at all.<a name=216:2></a> He numbers the very hairs of our heads.<a name=216:3></a> We read of a book of remembrance written before Him for His people, (<a href="../bible/Malachi.htm#3">Malachi  3</a>); also that He writeth up His people, (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#87">Psalm  87</a>).<a name=216:4></a> We little take in, even in physical things, how minute <i>God</i> is in His dealings!<a name=216:5></a> The things that are made are said to be a testimony to "His eternal power and divinity", (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#1:20">Romans  1:20</a>), for in them the invisible things of Him are clearly seen.<a name=216:6></a> So that it is not at all too much to think of the divine record including the <i>lives</i> of the saints, for what are the lives of the saints, think you?<a name=216:7></a> They are but the expansion, of the life of Jesus that is what they are; and such life is always delightful to God!<a name=216:8></a> As it is said to the apostle Peter: "Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life", (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#5:20">Acts  5:20</a>).<a name=216:9></a> The life of David was very compressed.<a name=216:10></a> We read of "the times that passed <i>over</i> him", (<a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#29:30">1 Chronicles  29:30</a>), all his reign and his might, and so forth.<a name=216:11></a> It was recorded, as one has often remarked, by three of the most spiritual men of his time, or of any time -- Samuel the prophet, Nathan the prophet, and Gad the seer.<a name=216:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now you will see the importance of what I have before me, of willingness in the saints to do the divine pleasure.<a name=216:13></a> So Philippians encourages us, as touching on the life of Jesus from His emptying Himself -- profound expression!<a name=216:14></a> We refer to these expressions reverently.<a name=216:15></a> Being "in the form of God", He took "a bondman's form", and being "found in figure as a man".<a name=216:16></a> He humbled Himself, "becoming obedient even unto death, and that the death of the cross".<a name=216:17></a> That is the mind of Jesus -- the descending mind of <i>love</i>.<a name=216:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then we have the life of the apostle spread out before us, his sufferings and his motives and his aspirations.<a name=216:19></a> He pressed "toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus", after having

	<div class="paragraph">
		told us that his great thought was to "arrive at the resurrection from among the dead"; that he should be conformable to His death, that he should not be behind in the sufferings of Christ.<a name=217:1></a> Well, in the presence of that -- the infinity of the life of Jesus, and then the finite reflection of that life in the apostle -- he says to us: "It is God who works in you".<a name=217:2></a> How can we hope for anything of what I have been speaking otherwise?<a name=217:3></a> "It is God", he says, "which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure".<a name=217:4></a> That is going on.<a name=217:5></a> One rests in that: God working in us.<a name=217:6></a> We look at the physical system and speak of it as the work of God.<a name=217:7></a> He made the heavens and the earth, bringing things out of chaos into order in the 'days' -- all "very good".<a name=217:8></a> But we often overlook what is going on in <i>our own selves</i>, a far greater thing -- something that will survive as the physical world passes away; that work is going on in us.<a name=217:9></a> Ephesians links it up with the heavenly position, but it is brought in here in connection with the divine pleasure, the willing and the doing of the will of God.<a name=217:10></a> That is, Philippians looks at our position here which flows out of the work of God, as all emanating from the descending of Christ and His death.<a name=217:11></a> One would appeal to the young people -- one always loves to do that -- because we who are a little older would wish to bring them with us, not simply by way of external influence, but by the way of <i>showing</i>, them that the thing is very good, that there is something in it, something worth while!<a name=217:12></a> In fact, one has often referred to the epistle of John where our faith is said to be victorious: "This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith" -- that is to say, we are going on with something that <i>is</i> victorious; it has always been victorious, and it always will be.<a name=217:13></a> You are coming into that.<a name=217:14></a> You did not inaugurate it, I did not inaugurate it, but the thing is there, victorious from the very start, and it is for us to go on with it, "even our faith".<a name=217:15></a> So that the point is to

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=249:4></a> Well, I suppose so.<a name=249:5></a> You see in (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:41">Acts  2:41</a>), how the converts were added -- there were three thousand added.<a name=249:6></a> It does not say who added them or to whom they were added, but they were added; and then their subsequent conduct showed they were qualified -- "they continued steadfastly in the apostles- doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers".<a name=249:7></a> Then it is said, they were constantly in the temple, breaking bread in the house.<a name=249:8></a> They also thought of one another's need; love was prevalent, unselfish consideration for others.<a name=249:9></a> The Lord, as it were, comes in now and says: 'I am not ashamed to add to you'.<a name=249:10></a> That is how it worked out.<a name=249:11></a> There is great weakness today because young people in coming in have not got the understanding of the assembly as a moral whole; however few may be in the thing the principle is there, for the word 'assembly' here is not necessarily <i>every</i> Israelite, but a representative idea of the whole: and if one does not come into fellowship in the recognition of that he is sure to be an element of weakness.<a name=249:12></a> Then, secondly, he is a member of the congregation; he is one of the whole and he has his own responsibility.<a name=249:13></a> He was to have the lamb in his house.<a name=249:14></a> It would be inconceivable that any Israelite on that night should be without the lamb; but it should be equally inconceivable now that any true believer should be without Christ apprehended in this way in his soul in relation to others.<a name=249:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=252:1></a> We have dealt with chapter 12 particularly as presenting the use of the word 'assembly', thus indicating that the Israelites, in the presence of the judgments of God, as depicted in the plagues, had been formed by what transpired before them; so that the idea of the assembly had been reached even before they had left Egypt.<a name=252:2></a> In leaving Egypt they went out in order, and, typically at least, in accord with the mind of God, having partaken of the passover and the feast of unleavened bread.<a name=252:3></a> They went out in rank, as it is said, with a high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians, (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#33:3">Numbers  33:3</a>), and moreover, they went out with substance.<a name=252:4></a> God had earlier said to Abraham that they should be afflicted in a foreign land four hundred years, and that then He would bring them out with great substance, (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#15:13">Genesis  15:13</a> - 14).<a name=252:5></a> So that they went out furnished with what was needed for the house of God and they went out in a dignified way.<a name=252:6></a> They were superior to the world in dignity and power.<a name=252:7></a> They were intended to supersede Egypt: indeed, it is said that Egypt was destroyed in its first born, but Israel was preserved under shelter of the blood of Christ, typically, and in the eating of the lamb.<a name=252:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The remaining chapters in Exodus, after chapter 15, work out all these things, and I thought we might see in this chapter the response to God, not only in regard to what He had done for them in Egypt and in taking them out of it, but in what He was in the covenant.<a name=252:9></a> Chapter 34 gives the renewal of the covenant.<a name=252:10></a> ".<a name=252:11></a>.<a name=252:12></a>.<a name=252:13></a> The two tables of testimony were in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mountain .<a name=252:14></a>.<a name=252:15></a>.<a name=252:16></a> .<a name=252:17></a> Moses knew not that the skin of his face shone through his talking with him", verse 29.<a name=252:18></a> There was <i>shining</i> there, indicating what God is in His covenant, in His love to us, which is expressed in

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=253:12></a> That is Jerusalem, but this corresponds.<a name=253:13></a> It was the time in which love in God came out, and I think this chapter shows that love was active in Israel, for it was a question of their <i>hearts</i>, verse 21.<a name=253:14></a> I think we may see here that there is ample response.<a name=253:15></a> The people had passed through much, and their break down only served as an occasion for God to shine out in His love, through the mediator, because Moses acts typically as the mediator of the new covenant: his face shone, he was affected himself by what he saw on the mount.<a name=253:16></a> In Christ it was altogether that, it was Himself -- "the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord", and the glory of God shines in His face and we behold it without a veil.<a name=253:17></a> It is in the light of that, that the heart is prompted.<a name=253:18></a> But it is well to notice that the first great feature in the chapter is the sabbath.<a name=253:19></a>

		I am thinking of <i>divine leading</i>, wishing to group the subject under three heads, indicated in these scriptures: angelic leading; the leading of the Lord; and the leading of the Spirit.<a name=269:1></a> Leading has ever marked God's dealings with His people, particularly as taking them out of the world, out of Egypt.<a name=269:2></a> It was not only that He led them out of the land of Egypt, that was the delivering side of His service.<a name=269:3></a> He intended to lead them through the wilderness; He would show how He would lead them through not withstanding all the vicissitudes and variety of wilderness conditions.<a name=269:4></a> And then He would lead them into the land: there was the leading out, when He "took them by the hand", (<a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#31:32">Jeremiah  31:32</a>), and then there was the leading in, which was by attraction -- by the ark.<a name=269:5></a> Between these two there was the leading connected with the tabernacle.<a name=269:6></a> God would show in that what He was to the people in those extraordinary circumstances; the book of Numbers impresses us with the fact that they were guided by the cloud on the tabernacle; whether it abode for a day or a month or a year, they remained until it moved.<a name=269:7></a> But then, God says later that He sent before them Moses and Aaron and Miriam, (<a href="../bible/Micah.htm#6:4">Micah  6:4</a>); that brings the idea down to persons, each of whom had a history, and each of whom was known to Israel; they were not strangers.<a name=269:8></a> They were sent before the people, which is the true idea of leading.<a name=269:9></a> A leader goes before, hence He sent <i>before</i> them Moses and Aaron and Miriam; there was in that leadership thus divine authority in Moses, purity and priestly feeling in Aaron, and a prophetic influence, and withal musical, in Miriam.<a name=269:10></a> So that there was a combination in the three calculated to induce following, they were worthy leaders.<a name=269:11></a> But they were but types of what <i>we</i> have; we have all these features, only in a greatly accentuated way, in Christ who

	<div class="paragraph">
		is marked by them in the fullest possible manner; especially in the feelings of affection and in musical attractiveness, music being intended to draw out our best feelings so that we are drawn along.<a name=270:1></a> The idea, therefore, was that He sent these three before, they were <i>before</i>, they could be seen.<a name=270:2></a> There was divine leading in known persons.<a name=270:3></a>

		Now I wish to gather up what I have to say, first under the head of angelic service; and I have taken Peter in these circumstances in (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#12">Acts  12</a>) as illustrative of the <i>limiting of divine ministry</i> in the history of the church.<a name=270:4></a> What has marked the history of the church in that way is the limiting or hindering of spiritual ministry.<a name=270:5></a> This incident occurred during "the days of unleavened bread", showing that the very worst action against God and against His ministers may take place at the time of legal religious observances.<a name=270:6></a> How far away Herod and the leaders in Jerusalem were from the true idea of the feast of unleavened bread!<a name=270:7></a> It was at that time that Herod laid hands on James, the brother of John, and slew him, and seeing that it pleased the Jews, that is to say, the murder of God's servant pleased them, he proceeded further to take Peter also.<a name=270:8></a> All this is a striking illustration of the conditions that prevail today, dear brethren -- the outward observance of things with divine names without the least correspondence to them in those who observe them.<a name=270:9></a> And then he proceeded to take Peter, and imprisoned him, hoping to bring him forth.<a name=270:10></a> Peter was asleep "between two soldiers, bound with two chains".<a name=270:11></a> I refer to him, as I said, as illustrative of the restriction of the ministry, and how God worked angelically to release it, so that we have free ministry now -- thank God!<a name=270:12></a> One of the greatest things that God has recovered for us is the free ministry of the Spirit.<a name=270:13></a> Peter was asleep in the prison.<a name=270:14></a> I do not refer to him in any disparaging way at all; I am simply using the circumstance to illustrate what came about in the history of the assembly.<a name=270:15></a> Ministry had

		to come through certain channels and this virtually implied the complete quenching of true spiritual ministry.<a name=271:1></a> So that God resorted to angelic service to release the ministry.<a name=271:2></a> One wrote -- as many of you know -- a remarkable paper entitled, "The Notion of a Clergyman, Dispensationally the sin against the Holy Ghost".<a name=271:3></a> Not that any <i>individual</i> was guilty of that sin, that was not the point, but that there was such a thing, a definite prolonged action against the Spirit, finally limiting the ministry; and God began to intervene angelically, that is to say, by providential happenings.<a name=271:4></a> I am speaking of what is known to many of us, not to be historical, but just to name certain facts from which we are all benefiting now.<a name=271:5></a> God intervened through providential means which would take a long time to record, but in one way and another, during the period of more than a century, certain happenings broke down the carriers that were raised up against the ministry of the Spirit of God, and men began to speak freely.<a name=271:6></a> Many of them were imprisoned, others suffered death, but by one means or another God brought about the releasing of the ministry.<a name=271:7></a> And so here, "Lo, an angel of the Lord came there, and a light shone in the prison", verse 7.<a name=271:8></a> Now, these prisons in which the ministry had been kept could not be entirely shut against God.<a name=271:9></a> "The word of God", as the apostle says, "is not bound", (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:9">2 Timothy  2:9</a>).<a name=271:10></a> God will always find a way of getting in; it may be through the most humble persons, or by placing such in a position where they can speak a word where it tells.<a name=271:11></a> Thus the angel of the Lord came to Peter; he reached Peter in spite of the guards, soldiers, or chains, or the iron door; the angel got in, and a light -- the light of heaven -- shone there.<a name=271:12></a> None of us would have got out of the prisons in which we were held were it not that light shone into them.<a name=271:13></a> The angel takes account of what was in the prison, that a real servant of God was there asleep.<a name=271:14></a> It says "first, Simon who is called Peter", (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#10:2">Matthew  10:2</a>); that is, he had the leading place among the

		servants of God, but he was asleep.<a name=272:1></a> And the angel of the Lord smote him "on the side", a well known thought to all those who love Jesus.<a name=272:2></a> However affected by human limitations, that thought of the side of Jesus is not lost on those who know Him.<a name=272:3></a> It is the testimony of the love of Christ in His death brought to bear forcibly -- not yet in the Lord's supper, it was a question of an effective reminder by an angel of the love of Christ in His death; and the angel said: "Rise up quickly .<a name=272:4></a>.<a name=272:5></a>.<a name=272:6></a> and follow me".<a name=272:7></a> "Cast thine upper garment about thee", verse 8.<a name=272:8></a> I have no doubt the garments have a spiritual meaning; and the sandals were to be bound on, for it was a matter of a journey; it was a long distance <i>morally</i> between that prison and the objective that the angel had in mind: the objective that corresponds with the side of Christ -- a sphere where the love of Christ is, where love is amongst the saints -- there was a long journey morally between these two points.<a name=272:9></a> Thousands have taken that journey, God having come in, in His own providential way, in their circumstances, smiting them on the side, as it were, so that they move and take their garments and bind on their sandals, and follow the angel.<a name=272:10></a> It is a question of angelic leading.<a name=272:11></a> But such leading is for a man who is still asleep; anyway, he was not awake to what was going on.<a name=272:12></a> There are thousands like that today, real people of God, but you talk to them and they seem to be in their sleep; they are not sure of what is going on.<a name=272:13></a> But there is something going on, and they do things in a sort of instinctive way.<a name=272:14></a> Peter does everything he is told to do; that is an important matter.<a name=272:15></a> We must not ignore any circumstance that God brings about.<a name=272:16></a> What I may do myself is another matter, but there is what God brings about, and He is ever active in relation to His people, and what He does is done with purpose.<a name=272:17></a> God would not lift His finger without a purpose.<a name=272:18></a> So they pass on through a first and second guard.<a name=272:19></a> One might speak about these guards, what they were <i>ecclesiastically</i> in the history of

		Now we come to the leading of <i>the Lord</i>, The providential dealings of God are to the end that I should come directly under the leading of the Lord.<a name=275:7></a> I have not reached it yet; it may be I have not been accustomed to enquire as to the Lord and where He is, or whether He has anything to say as to my circumstances; perhaps I have not been concerned about that.<a name=275:8></a> So I go to Luke; Luke is concerned very largely in his ministry, with public order and the leading of the Lord, corresponding with what we get in 1 Corinthians -- "If anyone thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him recognise the things that I write to you, that it is the Lord's commandment", (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14:37">1 Corinthians  14:37</a>).<a name=275:9></a> Now, you see, I have to do, not with Paul, but with the Lord.<a name=275:10></a> And Luke would confirm this, that it is a question of the Lord and how He leads; and so it says that He led them out as far as to Bethany (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:50">Luke  24:50</a>).<a name=275:11></a> It is a calculated action; a leading from one point, from the upper room in Jerusalem, where they were, as far as to Bethany; He led them <i>that far</i>.<a name=275:12></a> Now, what I am speaking of, dear brethren, is of the utmost importance if I want to understand leading, that the Lord leads me to anoint; He does so in His own perfect wisdom and His own perfect knowledge of what I need.<a name=275:13></a> He will not lead me beyond that.<a name=275:14></a> If I am in a bad state and going beyond, going far away to a place like Emmaus, well.<a name=275:15></a> He will go there.<a name=275:16></a> He will go any distance to get me.<a name=275:17></a> He made as if He would go even further,

		J.T.<a name=282:1></a> I was thinking of the great place the Holy Spirit has in type in these early books, taking this chapter as illustrative of the subject in the idea of a well or a spring.<a name=282:2></a> We find the idea of a well or spring running through Genesis, Exodus and Numbers, and later, too; and I thought it would be helpful to look at it as typical not only of the Spirit, but of the system of grace in which the Spirit of God is dominant.<a name=282:3></a> It may be observed that the idea is connected with Hagar for the first time in Scripture, so that fact emphasises the thought of grace, in its being connected with such a person, in chapter 16 and in this.<a name=282:4></a> But although emphasised in her history, she fails of the true gain of it, and in that there is a warning.<a name=282:5></a> Then in Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph and Moses we have faith availing itself of the divine provision; so that we should not lack of the grace of God, nor put the, flesh in the place of the Spirit in our service and testimony, and our general experience.<a name=282:6></a> I thought this passage would help us on that line, for Abraham takes up the thread in his communications with Abimelech, and shows how he valued the well.<a name=282:7></a>

		J.T.<a name=282:10></a> Well, it was typical of God's overtures to the Jew.<a name=282:11></a> In Luke, the Lord makes a point of the disciples not leaving Jerusalem until they received the Spirit; it was the Spirit of grace.<a name=282:12></a> The Jews did despite to the Spirit of grace in result, but God took the greatest pains to present that testimony to them.<a name=282:13></a> Hagar was, like many young persons, in self will when the angel found her; it says he found her by a spring on the way to Shur.<a name=282:14></a> That is what comes out, as she is in self-will fleeing from her mistress, he found her there.<a name=282:15></a>

		J.T.<a name=283:12></a> The test was obedience.<a name=283:13></a> She was fleeing from her mistress, that was what marked her; but it says an angel found her by the spring; he found her by it.<a name=283:14></a> Where did the spring come from?<a name=283:15></a> Who provided it?<a name=283:16></a> That is the next question.<a name=283:17></a> Spiritually, it cost much that there should be such a thing as that.<a name=283:18></a> But there it was, and the angel found her by it, but before there could be any profit from the spring there must be subjection; so that he challenges her as to her position and why she was there.<a name=283:19></a> He says: "Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence earnest thou?<a name=283:20></a> and whither wilt thou go?<a name=283:21></a>" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#16:8">Genesis  16:8</a>).<a name=283:22></a> That is the challenge.<a name=283:23></a> He was really raising the moral question with her, as the Lord did with the Samaritan woman.<a name=283:24></a> The well was there, but the moral question had to be raised and settled.<a name=283:25></a>

		I am thinking, dear brethren, in reading these scriptures, of the important subject of <i>teaching</i>; first the teaching of grace, then the teaching of the Lord, and, finally, the teaching of the Holy Spirit.<a name=297:1></a> Under these heads the idea of divine teaching is presented.<a name=297:2></a> You will all remember the Lord's remark, citing Isaiah, that His people should be all <i>taught</i> of God.<a name=297:3></a> As it says in the passage alluded to "All thy children shall be taught of the Lord; and great shall be the peace of thy children" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#54:13">Isaiah  54:13</a>) -- that is, Jerusalem's children.<a name=297:4></a> Now, a divinely taught person is not simply one who knows things; he does know, of course, but teaching, learning from God, is more, than the mere acquisition of knowledge.<a name=297:5></a> The pupil or disciple is brought under discipline, so that his mind is not only stored with knowledge, but <i>he</i> is affected himself; the person is affected correspondingly by what is forced into his mind, for this is really the idea.<a name=297:6></a> If one is in school, learning, strictly speaking, is not optional: it is a question of what is to be taught, and one must go through the course; and this, of course, is obvious in the things of God.<a name=297:7></a> Anyone who assumes that learning the things of God, learning from God, is an optional matter will never, to say the least, arrive at the church.<a name=297:8></a> One might say that there is an element of lawlessness in any pupil assuming that lessons in the school are optional.<a name=297:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to speak of the teaching of grace as bearing on what has been before us and upon the dispensation.<a name=297:10></a> It is an immense thing, dear brethren, to maintain the dispensation; whatever else happens, or whatever the loss, or whatever the suffering, it must be maintained, at least in principle.<a name=297:11></a> Making full allowance for the day of small things such as this is in which we are, the principle of the dispensation must never be denied or falsified, it

		stupendous thing.<a name=299:1></a> The will of God involved a tremendous obligation, and the Lord Jesus accepted it.<a name=299:2></a> And so, as we are brought into the current of faith, each in his measure accepts obligation, and the more we are with God, the more extended will that be, until you begin to accept obligation, not only for yourself, but for your household, your business, for the local company, and for the whole church of God on earth, and for the government of God on earth -- for all these come within the range of Christian obligation.<a name=299:3></a> The principle is: "Take the <i>lad, and hold him in thy hand"</i> (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#21:18">Genesis  21:18</a>).<a name=299:4></a> Now, that lad, Ishmael, was fourteen years of age; it was no light matter to hold a lad of that age, the weight <i>was felt</i>, and that is what God values.<a name=299:5></a> God will surely help us as we accept responsibility, feeling its weight.<a name=299:6></a> And so in our day of low public morality, the believer accepts obligation peculiarly; he is not going to be a legalist, we can do nothing on that line.<a name=299:7></a> The law, as we are told, makes nothing perfect, <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#7:19">Hebrews  7:19</a>, it never did make anything perfect, so that to go back to that is to surrender the position; the position is grace, but grace that has teaching.<a name=299:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Here the apostle presents it in its broadest aspect: he says it "carries with it salvation for all men".<a name=299:9></a> You say, 'The morals are dreadful'; so they are, but the grace of God is infinitely above, that.<a name=299:10></a> It does not ignore what exists, but one idea of grace is that it is greater than the sin it deals with: it is infinitely above the sin; and so great the greatest sinner.<a name=299:11></a> That is the idea in <a href="../bible/Titus.htm#2">Titus  2</a>-- that the earful condition of the world does not in itself preclude the action of grace.<a name=299:12></a> Grace, it says, "carries with it salvation for all men", that is the extent of it, and it "has appeared".<a name=299:13></a> The faithful believer would say: 'It must not disappear as far as I am concerned'.<a name=299:14></a> Christendom has put it out of view, it has gone back to the law and to paganism; but the grace of God <i>has</i> appeared, and, as far

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, dear brethren, that is the first great lesson in divine teaching.<a name=300:6></a> I am not denying that there may be other things, but I am speaking of the public position of the saints, the continuance of the dispensation and that this teaching of grace is imperative.<a name=300:7></a> Much more is added in the passage which is strengthening to the heart.<a name=300:8></a> "Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ".<a name=300:9></a> That is to say, another world is in view, I am denying this one and I am hailing another one; I am looking for it -- "Awaiting the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ" -- for it is the same Person.<a name=300:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, this fits in in the type, dear brethren, with the position in Exodus up to chapter 18.<a name=300:11></a> God never complains, He never resents the murmurings of His people, grace is greater than their murmurings; but when the law is given, when God asserts His rights formally (I am speaking of the law now typically, not literally), then the school becomes more rigorous, more exacting: not that there is any less love, nor any less grace, but it would be monstrous to assume that there is not such a thing as law in christianity.<a name=300:12></a> You may call it the 'perfect law of liberty' -- and so it is; it is the 'royal law', too: but if we are to have to do with God, there must be requirements, and so this brings in another thing, that is, <i>the teaching of</i>

		Now, the church underlies all that, as I said.<a name=302:11></a> We have not got it publicly I know, but it exists; and what leads to its practical realisation today is this principle of teaching, and the question is whether we are teachable?<a name=302:12></a> One of the things we have to be on our guard against is latitudinarianism, it is a dangerous thing, and most subtle -- that I can say things without scriptural support -- and they are allowed to drift; that is not of God.<a name=302:13></a> Teaching implies that we must have the truth.<a name=302:14></a> For this we need the teaching of grace, the teaching of the Lord and the teaching of the Spirit.<a name=302:15></a> And so, as Paul secures those twelve men at Ephesus, they all receive the Holy Spirit at one time, a remarkable <i>fact</i>.<a name=302:16></a> But then he would go into the synagogue, he would maintain the principle still in force -- "to the Jew first".<a name=302:17></a> But when some hardened themselves and disputed, he "<i>separated</i> the disciples" -- that is the position now.<a name=302:18></a> The church era, in its full status on earth, is based on separation, not only from a lewd world, but from a religious world.<a name=302:19></a> What comes out in Matthew is that the Lord left the

		To pass on to the final teaching: we get it in John.<a name=305:6></a> John has a most interesting way of presenting this subject.<a name=305:7></a> In his gospel he records that the first two disciples that Jesus had, <i>called</i> Him 'Rabbi'.<a name=305:8></a> This emphasises what I am saying, that love will have teaching.<a name=305:9></a> The Holy Spirit is careful to tell us what that means, so that we should know the thought that was in their minds -- the idea of teaching.<a name=305:10></a> Up to that time they had had the most remarkable teacher, but now they have come to?<a name=305:11></a> Better Then in chapter 20 we have as no one else, certainly among women, loved Him -- Mary Magdalene.<a name=305:12></a> She calls Him 'Rabboni' ('my teacher'), and that was as risen from the dead; she understood that the teaching was necessary and that she needed it.<a name=305:13></a> I do not say that it will be needed in heaven, I do not think so; indeed, the Lord says in Luke: "Every one that is perfect shall be as his master", chapter 6: 40.<a name=305:14></a> That is a very precious anticipation.<a name=305:15></a> The epistle to the Ephesians had "the perfecting of the saints" in view.<a name=305:16></a> The gifts in Ephesians are to that end.<a name=305:17></a> We are to arrive at the full-grown man <i>now</i>.<a name=305:18></a> As I see this I am industrious as a Christian; I miss nothing of the instruction the Lord gives.<a name=305:19></a> I shall not think it is optional to come to the meetings; the matter is too serious to treat it so lightly.<a name=305:20></a> If I am exercised about the meeting, is not the Lord also?<a name=305:21></a> He certainly is concerned about it.<a name=305:22></a> If I remain away carelessly He will note this.<a name=305:23></a> He will be there.<a name=305:24></a> It is a question of the school.<a name=305:25></a> As in the school,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am thinking, dear brethren, of how the element of <i>moral elevation</i> is interwoven in this book of the Acts, indeed, it runs through Luke's service and ministry; which ministry, as most of us know, is intended to support and amplify and make acceptable the ministry of Paul.<a name=309:1></a> There is a continual rise, as I may say, from chapter 1 to chapter 19, where he presents Paul as arriving at Ephesus through the upper districts.<a name=309:2></a> Those of us who travel have some idea of a physical rise in the earth's formation until a certain altitude is reached, and so in this book the moral altitude reached on the side of experience, in chapter 19 is that Paul arrived at Ephesus.<a name=309:3></a> In the gospel, Luke brings heaven <i>down</i>; for the divine way is to afford incentive to us in our souls' history, and the gospel of Luke furnishes, among many other things, an incentive to moral elevation in the soul, so that there is a steady rise instead of a steady decline.<a name=309:4></a> The decline of the church began in Ephesus; it began at the summit, and it comes down and down, so that the government of God intervenes as the decline reaches a point, and makes recovery impossible -- that is <i>general</i> recovery.<a name=309:5></a> Today the decline has been enormously accelerated, but that is in the government of God.<a name=309:6></a> It corresponds with the demons who, when cast out of the demoniac by the Lord in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#8">Matthew  8</a>, request to be allowed to enter into the swine, and entering in, we are told the swine "rushed down the steep slope into the sea", and "died in the waters", verse 32.<a name=309:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was the government of God, there was no hope; It is a most solemn thing that as decline reaches a point God intervenes, and it becomes more rapid; it has thus become more rapid in our own times.<a name=309:8></a> The rush down is violent, and so there is all the more need to understand the principle of incline or elevation, which, happily, is

	<div class="paragraph">
		available to each individual, but he has got to face the rush and stand against it.<a name=310:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so the gospel of Luke affords incentive; that is to say, heaven is brought down.<a name=310:2></a> The evangelist, in writing to a man, evidently of dignity in this world, one who deserved consideration, addresses him as "Most excellent Theophilus"; such persons deserve consideration where it is due.<a name=310:3></a> Persons of distinction in this world are at a disadvantage, whether their dignity is acquired or conferred or inherited, but God does not leave them out because of this; He works in their souls and shows that His work goes on in spite of the disadvantage.<a name=310:4></a> Nevertheless, the disadvantage is there and must not be ignored.<a name=310:5></a> So Luke, whilst recognising the excellency according to man's estimate of Theophilus, introduces heavenly dignitaries.<a name=310:6></a> If one could see Gabriel or Michael -- not to speak of the Lord of glory, for His is supreme dignity!<a name=310:7></a> But even in one of the subordinates of the Lord of glory, what dignity one would see!<a name=310:8></a> Were Theophilus to stand up beside Gabriel, he would readily listen to Luke, and he did listen to him, for this second treatise shows that he gained in his soul by the first; but considering Gabriel, he would the more readily see what human dignity, what dignity in this world is, that it is but as a flower of the grass.<a name=310:9></a> "<i>All</i> flesh".<a name=310:10></a> Scripture says, that is, dignified flesh as well as other flesh, "is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass.<a name=310:11></a> The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away", (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:24">1 Peter  1:24</a>).<a name=310:12></a> It would surely wither up in our souls in the light of a heavenly dignitary such as Gabriel, the glory of man would fail.<a name=310:13></a> So Luke introduces Gabriel to us, or to Theophilus, as "standing on the right of the altar of incense"; that is to say, he stood in the place of power, but power in relation to the greatest excellency, for the incense is, typically, the intrinsic excellency of Christ.<a name=310:14></a> That is the divine thought as to the altar of incense.<a name=310:15></a> Well, that is not the kind of thing
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=311>[Page 311]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that is expressed in the word 'excellency' as applied to a governor or a president in this world.<a name=311:1></a> God would bring in, you see, intrinsic excellency, and that is not acquired in this world according to man, it is a divine quality; it has come to light in Christ as Man.<a name=311:2></a> All excellency according to God has come to light in Christ becoming Man here and moving about this world.<a name=311:3></a> Think of the intrinsic excellency, beloved, that was there in that outward form of humility!<a name=311:4></a> And there was excellency with Gabriel, at the right hand of the altar of incense.<a name=311:5></a> Then again, in speaking to Mary about the Lord, the angel speaks of the "holy thing", not simply the holy Person -- but the holy thing, as referring to what Christ was as intrinsically <i>holy</i>.<a name=311:6></a> Not in the sense in which a priest is sanctified by the Spirit, but intrinsically holy.<a name=311:7></a> That could be said of none other, and Luke would bring that near to us in the Person of Jesus.<a name=311:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in the second chapter of Luke, heaven comes down; not now in specially dignified angels, but in "a multitude".<a name=311:9></a> First, there is one speaking with the shepherds, but the glory that shines round about the shepherds, is the glory of the Lord, not of the angel.<a name=311:10></a> In relation to this one evangelical angel, we have the glory of the Lord shining round about the shepherds, so that we have an incentive to moral elevation introduced at once; and then, with that angel, a multitude of the heavenly host appears.<a name=311:11></a> So that heaven is brought down in volume, and they were saying, "Glory to God in the <i>highest</i>" There is nothing higher than that, there is no greater moral elevation than that.<a name=311:12></a> That is, of course, literal, but it is also moral.<a name=311:13></a> When it is a question of what God is as compared with men here.<a name=311:14></a> He is called the Highest; but this is the position, it is "in the highest", glory is there, and "on earth peace, good pleasure in men".<a name=311:15></a> Thus throughout Luke we have the same thread, so that as the Lord enters Jerusalem for the last time, the multitude are saying: "Peace in heaven, and

	<div class="paragraph">
		That is the viewpoint in the book of Acts from the very outset, and it is to appear in the assembly.<a name=312:4></a> We see in these verses in chapter 1 the way the Lord went up, and not simply that He went up, but the manner of His going up.<a name=312:5></a> We read of the ascent by which Solomon went up to the house of the Lord; that affected the queen of Sheba profoundly; but then compare that with this!<a name=312:6></a> This is not simply going up to the house of the Lord, but the Lord of glory returning to His own place, to heaven.<a name=312:7></a> We have to think of what underlies the movement, the Person who was there, the home above so well known, and all the reception that was about to be accorded to Him.<a name=312:8></a> The passage says that having said certain things to them, "<i>He was taken up</i>", but it adds "<i>they beholding him</i>" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:9">Acts  1:9</a>).<a name=312:9></a> That is an element that remains.<a name=312:10></a> However many there were present the thing was seen by them as far exceeding what the queen of Sheba saw.<a name=312:11></a> "They beholding him", their hearts were in it, beloved brethren.<a name=312:12></a> He has been communing with them and now the opportune moment arrives and He is taken up, they beholding Him.<a name=312:13></a> The golden thread of moral elevation is there; what they saw, the kind of movement that they beheld, was not to be effaced.<a name=312:14></a> The Lord had said earlier that certain should not see death until they saw the Son of man coming in His kingdom.<a name=312:15></a> That is another view.<a name=312:16></a> One is moved in thinking of the many views of Christ's movements that were to be beheld.<a name=312:17></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>He is seen as "the hind of the morning".<a name=312:18></a> That alludes to His resurrection.<a name=312:19></a> We often hear of heavenly spectacles that are to be seen, once, it may be, in a hundred years, eclipses and the like -- well, now, this is a marvellous thing, "the hind of the morning".<a name=312:20></a>

		And those who were up early saw it.<a name=313:1></a> I refer to the peculiar privilege of seeing the Lord immediately as He arose from the dead.<a name=313:2></a> We read in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>of Mary Magdalene coming in early morning, while it was still dark.<a name=313:3></a> If I value the agility of Christ, "the hind of the morning", the grace of His movements, I must be moving early in the morning.<a name=313:4></a> It is the best time to get divine impressions; we find in the Old Testament, continually, how things were done early.<a name=313:5></a> So there was to be seen on that morning without an equal, the movements of Christ, His graces and affection.<a name=313:6></a> With what agility the Lord moved from one to another of those whom He loved!<a name=313:7></a> Then, as I said, there is that other view -- the Son of man coming in His kingdom.<a name=313:8></a> And John the baptist was affected as he saw Him <i>walking</i>; there was grace in that movement also.<a name=313:9></a> The Son of man coming in His kingdom is the idea of <i>majesty</i>.<a name=313:10></a> All these things are intended to deliver us from the tinsel of human glory.<a name=313:11></a> Majesty, according to man, is much spoken of; and dignity in various grades, but Luke would deliver us in a gradual, steady, but certain way, from all vain show.<a name=313:12></a> We are not despising majesty as applied to men in this world under the government of God, He recognises it in its place; but in the most effective manner Luke introduces the thread of moral elevation, so that the thing gradually slips away and becomes nothing.<a name=313:13></a> What would all the glory of the Caesars or of the kings of this period, be, compared with the Son of man coming in His glory!<a name=313:14></a>

		Now, the scripture in chapter 19, is the summit, chapter 10 is on the way to it.<a name=318:4></a> You have emphasised in this book the thought of heaven: the <i>sound</i> from heaven, in chapter 2, and the Holy Spirit coming from heaven; in chapter 9 the <i>light</i> from heaven, and the voice of Jesus speaking to Saul, and in chapter 10 the <i>sheet</i> from heaven.<a name=318:5></a> Heaven has asserted itself in a peculiar way in the sheet.<a name=318:6></a> The full result of all this is seen in Paul: he is the acme of moral elevation from the positive side; and God, as it were, accelerated the idea in him early in his life, fourteen years before, by taking him up.<a name=318:7></a> "I know a man in Christ", he said -- it was fresh in his mind -- "such a one caught up to the third heaven .<a name=318:8></a>.<a name=318:9></a>.<a name=318:10></a> he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable things said which it is not allowed to man to utter", (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#12:2">2 Corinthians  12:2</a> - 4).<a name=318:11></a> You get two things: "the third heaven" and "paradise", the third heaven is the <i>elevation</i>, and paradise is the <i>blessedness</i> of the place -- these two things go together.<a name=318:12></a> So that the apostle was fitted by this experience in a peculiar way to bring out the position of the church, the heavenly vessel, in which the glory of God is to shine throughout "all generations of the age of ages", it is a wonderful vessel!<a name=318:13></a> He arrives, we are told, while Apollos was at Corinth.<a name=318:14></a> Apollos, as we may say, was holding the ground in relation to public order.<a name=318:15></a> Corinth, in the light of the epistles to the church there, stands for public order in the house of God; but Ephesus stands for the heavenly side: the two things run together.<a name=318:16></a> Now, Apollos was at Corinth; that position was held.<a name=318:17></a> He had refused to go there at one time, because Paul could not go on account of their state, but

		All that corresponds with Ephesians, because chapter 20 of this book records the upper room again.<a name=320:16></a> It is the position of the church in the absence of Christ; it stands, I believe, for moral elevation pending the time of actual elevation, so that that elevation will not be new to us.<a name=320:17></a> We shall not look back, beloved, as we are taken up, with any longing desire for this poor world -- even though we may have occupied a castle in it, we shall go up with delight to our own place, our own home!<a name=320:18></a>

		I desire to speak about the Spirit of God.<a name=334:1></a> The subject is very extensive, for the Spirit of God is mentioned in the first chapter of the Bible, and in the last, and throughout all Scripture.<a name=334:2></a> It will be observed that He is alluded to in all the passages which I have read, and in at least six others in the Revelation: these six, however, are found in chapters 2 and 3, and are repetitions of verse 7 of chapter 2, and thus the four scriptures read convey the setting of the subject in this book.<a name=334:3></a>

		The first scripture involves christianity.<a name=334:4></a> The book itself does not treat of Christianity characteristically, nor does it treat of the church characteristically, although both Christianity and the church are in view throughout.<a name=334:5></a> Nor does the book treat of the Holy Spirit in His normal functions: it treats of Him in relation to the book itself, which is a book of distance.<a name=334:6></a> It is sobering to accept the terms implying distance in this book, for they enable us, whatever our inward experiences and relations with God, to take our place in the public position becomingly.<a name=334:7></a> We have our part in it, and God values this, and the feelings that go with it.<a name=334:8></a> We are very barren in spiritual feelings, dear brethren, and God would lead to a deepening of these.<a name=334:9></a> I believe the acceptance of the public position, involving the judgment of God, and involving distance, would lead to deepened feelings.<a name=334:10></a> You find these exemplified in the writer of the book throughout; and I believe the intent is to bring us into becoming feelings, that we might sigh and cry,, as they did of old, for the abominations that are practised.<a name=334:11></a> If we are at all with God we shall not be indifferent to these abominations.<a name=334:12></a> We shall feel with God about them, and these feelings will lead to prayers, and prayers will lead

		to divine intervention, so that in the midst of the conditions described there will be something for God in each locality -- for the idea of locality is another feature that the book would impress upon us.<a name=335:1></a> The book contains messages to the seven assemblies, and then the whole was sent to each; there would thus be universal intelligence, each assembly would know what were the conditions of all.<a name=335:2></a> Hence the book, whilst emphasising the locality, leads us out of undue occupation with that which is local into occupation with and concern for what is general.<a name=335:3></a> The book, therefore, has a very direct bearing upon us; but I want to speak about the Spirit, and perhaps the remarks I have made will help you to see more clearly what I have in mind.<a name=335:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first mention of the Spirit in the Revelation indicates an outlet from all the harrowing conditions; and no one can really view them aright, or face them, unless as experiencing in some way this outlet.<a name=335:5></a> We may ignore the conditions; we may shut our eyes to them; but that is not an outlet from them: that is very objectionable and displeasing to God.<a name=335:6></a> On the other hand, we may become so taken up with them as to be damaged by them, affected and coloured by them.<a name=335:7></a> So the outlet is of immense importance.<a name=335:8></a> As availed of, it enables us to come into these conditions as from God, in a spiritual manner.<a name=335:9></a> We see all things clearly.<a name=335:10></a> It is an important matter, not only to see a thing, but to see it <i>clearly</i>.<a name=335:11></a> In the gospel of Mark we have the second touch of the Lord to the blind man, which enabled him to see "all things dearly".<a name=335:12></a> So that there is no despondency or discouragement, but deepened feelings and corresponding prayers.<a name=335:13></a> What our hands find to do we do with our might; we do not let our hands hang down; we see that there is possible result, that our labour is "not in vain in the Lord"; and so we move on with encouragement and with the approval of the Lord.<a name=335:14></a> The prophet John here speaks about the outlet: he says, "I was in the Spirit on

		the Lord's day".<a name=336:1></a> He gives us also his geographical position, and why he was there: "for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ" he was in the isle that was called Patmos.<a name=336:2></a> But although isolated in that way, he had an outlet into what was of God -- into the spiritual realm.<a name=336:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two great realms.<a name=336:4></a> One is the mediatorial, realm, out of which, as I apprehend, we shall never go; being finite, we cannot get beyond that.<a name=336:5></a> Into it God has come, in all that He is, and in such wise as to be known in all the blessedness of His nature, but yet in the mediatorial area.<a name=336:6></a> Corresponding with that area is the area of the Spirit -- the spiritual realm.<a name=336:7></a> The Spirit is here mediatorially, as Christ was, and in Him there is an outlet, you see, not only from the physical limitations imposed upon us, as in John's case, but also from the limitations incurred by the failure of the assembly.<a name=336:8></a> It were utterly unintelligent to assume that there are no limitations accruing from the failure of the church.<a name=336:9></a> There are, but the Spirit is the outlet from all these things.<a name=336:10></a> This outlet is what the prophet calls here "in the Spirit" -- so that we may understand that that is available to us.<a name=336:11></a> It implies that there is at least a spiritual basis in us, but it is not within the range of the natural man: he understands not the things of the Spirit of God.<a name=336:12></a> By way of illustration I would allude to the Acts, in which we get precedents and examples of things -- not exactly doctrines, although they are there, but examples in the things themselves being presented.<a name=336:13></a> You find such a precedent in Philip; one who set out very simply to serve the Lord, without having ostensibly any commission, except that he was a deacon.<a name=336:14></a> But he moved out to serve the Lord and the Lord blessed him.<a name=336:15></a> He affords a good lead for those of us who desire to preach: we go and do it, and it soon becomes evident whether we are effective in it.<a name=336:16></a> In connection with Philip, he was directed by an <i>angel</i> to go into the desert, but, as in the desert, he

		is directed by the Spirit.<a name=337:1></a> I speak of this so that we may see how we come into the outlet.<a name=337:2></a> The way in which he moved in obedience to the angel brought in the action of the Spirit.<a name=337:3></a> He is directed by the Spirit to join himself to the eunuch's chariot.<a name=337:4></a> One of the greatest things is an opportunity, and opportunities lost may never be regained: but an opportunity availed of may lead to others.<a name=337:5></a> It is a great thing to discern an opportunity, and to avail oneself of it.<a name=337:6></a> The opportunity was there in the eunuch in his chariot, reading the Scriptures.<a name=337:7></a> One of the functions of the Holy Spirit is to indicate to what we are to join ourselves.<a name=337:8></a> We should be very careful to what we join ourselves.<a name=337:9></a> I would not join myself to one reading a novel, one of the things this world produces as food for men; but a man reading the Scriptures is another thing.<a name=337:10></a> The Holy Spirit said "Join thyself to this chariot", and Philip was ready -- he ran and did it.<a name=337:11></a> And then he was equal to the service, going the whole way, down into the water with the eunuch, Philip and the eunuch together -- a fine spectacle for heaven!<a name=337:12></a> Afterwards the passage says: "The Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip".<a name=337:13></a> I am showing you how the outlet is reached.<a name=337:14></a> One comes to a point where the Holy Spirit can take charge, so to speak, and not only take charge, but He caught him away.<a name=337:15></a> We have the two thoughts -- we have not yet been caught up: we are looking for it.<a name=337:16></a> Being caught away is very like being caught up.<a name=337:17></a> But the Acts, indeed, prepares us for the great events ahead of us, for it gives us the spectacle of a man going up!<a name=337:18></a> Hence the going up will not be new to those who saw Jesus go up.<a name=337:19></a> There is nothing for faith in that which man can do in the air at the present time -- much as it is.<a name=337:20></a> He will come and take us, and we shall go up; the experience of going up will be ours.<a name=337:21></a>

		not something inherent.<a name=338:1></a> That is what we speak of as 'the rapture', but that will not be new to Philip, and it is recorded, not as a mere matter of history, but so that the possibility of it may be impressed upon us.<a name=338:2></a> It is mentioned not as something very extraordinary, but in the simplest way, the Spirit of the Lord caught him away.<a name=338:3></a> He was sent by an angel from a most successful work, and he obeyed; now he has again completed a most successful piece of work, and Philip has now commended himself, so that the Holy Spirit takes complete charge of him.<a name=338:4></a> The brethren may praise us in serving -- and they should, surely -- but it may go too far.<a name=338:5></a> It <i>does</i> go too far, and there is too much of comparison with one another.<a name=338:6></a> It is unprofitable, as we read those "comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#10:12">2 Corinthians  10:12</a>).<a name=338:7></a> We have to consider whether the Holy Spirit is pleased.<a name=338:8></a> We speak of the Lord being pleased, but the Holy Spirit is intimately acquainted with what is going on in our service.<a name=338:9></a> So here it was the action of God, but it was the Holy Spirit.<a name=338:10></a> He was so intimately acquainted with what was going on in Philip's soul in his work and manner of service, that He raptured him, "the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip".<a name=338:11></a> He came back again to his ordinary conditions and preached as far as to Caesarea.<a name=338:12></a> He evidently knew where to stop, for Peter was to come in at Caesarea and open the door of grace to the gentiles.<a name=338:13></a> If Philip had been at all on natural lines, or elated with his success in service, he would have conveyed a false impression to the eunuch, and maybe have suggested to him to take him in the chariot with him: he might have become a very distinguished man in the kingdom of Candace, Queen of the Ethiopians.<a name=338:14></a> But the very idea of the king having a chaplain, or a chapel is ruled out entirely in the Scriptures.<a name=338:15></a> The Holy Spirit says, as it were, '<i>I</i> want this man', and the eunuch goes on his way -- he "saw him no more".<a name=338:16></a>

		It will be known to most of us that Deuteronomy gives us the words of Moses himself.<a name=345:1></a> He is in the position, not of being commanded to say certain things to the people, but rather of saying them of himself, and in saying them, he would convey the affection that he had for the people of God.<a name=345:2></a> Thus this book brings out uniquely the "man Moses".<a name=345:3></a> In <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#12:3">Numbers  12:3</a>, the Holy Spirit tells us that "the man Moses was very meek, above all men that were upon the face of the earth"; thus he is a figure of Christ.<a name=345:4></a> We have to take account of the Lord Jesus as the representative of God here, but we have also to take account of Him as He was, or as He is, "the man Christ Jesus", (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#2:5">1 Timothy  2:5</a>).<a name=345:5></a> Moses was but a figure; the Holy Spirit says all that is possible about him, there was none like him!<a name=345:6></a> He will say all He can about any of us: we may be sure that our good qualities shall not be unheard of.<a name=345:7></a> We need not advertise, the Spirit of God will place His own estimate where it will be known.<a name=345:8></a> And so, as Moses is envied, and, alas, by those nearest to him, Miriam and Aaron, the Lord came down to the tent door, so concerned was He as regards His servant and the place he had.<a name=345:9></a> He was one of three; God had sent before the people Moses, Aaron and Miriam, (<a href="../bible/Micah.htm#6:4">Micah  6:4</a>).<a name=345:10></a> Moses was one of three, but he was the first of the three.<a name=345:11></a> There is always that principle with God, and He has a very good reason for it.<a name=345:12></a> So that the man Moses was entitled to the place, not only had God given it to him, but he filled it well; and God came down to the door of the tent of meeting to settle the matter.<a name=345:13></a> We never need to defend ourselves, for it is a matter that God undertakes for everyone He came down specially to adjust this matter, and in the record of the adjustment the Holy Spirit says that the man Moses was the meekest in all the earth.<a name=345:14></a>

		Ques.<a name=357:1></a> Would you say how you apprehend the cities of refuge?<a name=357:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=357:3></a> The prominence given to them in the typical books shews how important the subject is, at least in regard to what they represent -- that is, the provision made in grace for the Jew.<a name=357:4></a> The Lord on the cross, according to Luke, says: "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do".<a name=357:5></a> And Stephen, in agreement with this, says: "Lord, lay not this sin to their charge".<a name=357:6></a> It is the element of grace introduced by the Lord Jesus on the cross, in keeping, indeed, with His whole ministry in Luke: that the greatest means might be available for the greatest sinner's to be sheltered; for the ground of the cities of refuge is that they were regarded as doing the thing ignorantly, in unbelief.<a name=357:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=357:8></a> It was God's provision for them in view of the murder of Christ?<a name=357:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=357:10></a> Yes.<a name=357:11></a> That element of grace, introduced by the Lord on the cross and reflected in Stephen-and, indeed, in the earlier saints generally -- was to reside in the assembly.<a name=357:12></a> Here you will observe: "When Jehovah thy God hath cut off the nations whose land Jehovah thy God giveth thee and thou hast dispossessed them, and dwellest in their cities and in their houses, thou shalt separate three cities .<a name=357:13></a>.<a name=357:14></a>.<a name=357:15></a>" That would mean that God had given salvation to His people, deliverance from their enemies, so that they were in peace, settled in the land; the element of grace would be prominent, not an attitude of vengeance, there was no such attitude in Christ; in the Psalms there is reference to vengeance, but not in the Acts, nor in Luke.<a name=357:16></a> It is grace.<a name=357:17></a> The saints, the members of the assembly, reflected that, notwithstanding the murderous attitude of the Jews.<a name=357:18></a> They reflected that spirit of grace, so that their very enemies, as in the case

		of Saul of Tarsus, found a residence of safety in the assembly.<a name=358:1></a> The great lesson for us, therefore, would be the maintenance of grace towards those who might oppose or persecute.<a name=358:2></a> In the sphere of the saints there is safety from the avenger of blood, there is protection from vengeance, even though the person might be deserving of it.<a name=358:3></a> "Thou shalt separate" -- the saints, as delivered from the satanic power, were thus to provide for the sinner.<a name=358:4></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=358:8></a> Yes; you see in Titus the thing is very prominent: "For the grace of God which carries with it salvation for all men has appeared".<a name=358:9></a> All men.<a name=358:10></a> Its bearing is towards those who are guilty of murder, the murder of Christ was deliberate, but it was not reckoned to the Jews in that way, not as if they knew "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do".<a name=358:11></a>

		J.T.<a name=358:19></a> It would mean increase in spiritual territory.<a name=358:20></a> I suppose it would refer to Paul's ministry.<a name=358:21></a> There was the ministry of the twelve which went to a point, and the primary thought is attached to their sphere, Judaea and Jerusalem; the ministry of the twelve extended to a point but not to the full extent of the purpose that God had in His mind.<a name=358:22></a> So that the second three would mean what went on amongst the nations by Paul's ministry, beginning with the Jews in every case, only there was an extension -- it was an extended ministry among the

		nations.<a name=359:1></a> Paul was really sent to the nations, but "the sons of Israel" were also included, so that he always made a point of going to the Jew first.<a name=359:2></a> The death of Stephen had brought out what they were doing, but he only asks the Lord not to lay "<i>this</i> sin" to their charge -- he does not make a general request.<a name=359:3></a> But the extension in Paul's ministry was provided for in the second three cities, showing the excess of grace; that what had happened at Jerusalem had really brought out that they knew what they were doing.<a name=359:4></a> Grace was presented to the Jews among the nations on the same principle as it had been presented at Jerusalem.<a name=359:5></a> What do you say?<a name=359:6></a>

		THE SEASONS OF THE YEAR
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The book of Genesis is very fruitful in illustrations and types of the truth of Christianity; and this chapter particularly so in regard to the truth of the glad tidings.<a name=372:1></a> What these verses suggest first of all is a world proceeding out, of judgment; all the elements for a new world being carried over safely in a vessel.<a name=372:2></a> The first chapter also presents a world out of judgment, only that we have not the living things carried over, nor is there a vessel.<a name=372:3></a> The earth emerged from the waters, but we have no idea of living things carried over, but creation -- a scene brought out of chaos in which God created and formed living beings; whereas here we have them carried thought.<a name=372:4></a> So this chapter contemplates in type (the ark) Christ Himself, at first in His own Person here upon earth, developing the elements of a new world; and then going through death, accepting the judgment of God as regards the world that then was, but carrying everything through.<a name=372:5></a> The greatness of Christ is thus brought to our attention in the ark; that He included in His mind every divine thought, every divine principle, every element necessary for the establishment of another order of things.<a name=372:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus Noah comes out of the ark under divine orders, and it is directed that his wife and his sons, and his sons' wives, should come out <i>with him</i>: It might not seem necessary that he should be ordered to come out, but the point is that this new order of things is under divine authority the will of God.<a name=372:7></a> There is no room for any other will.<a name=372:8></a> Then Noah was to bring the lower creatures out besides, which involves power.<a name=372:9></a> As you will observe in verse 16, first we have "Go forth", and then, in verse 17, "Bring forth"; the latter is a matter of power and all were to come out <i>with Noah</i>.<a name=372:10></a> All were thus to be under divine ordering; Noah being subject to command, was to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, that is what I wanted to mention first.<a name=373:2></a> And then to show the ground on which the gospel is announced.<a name=373:3></a> That is, Noah brought out clean animals, and having them, he built an altar and offered on the altar burnt-offerings to the Lord.<a name=373:4></a> In verse 20 it says: "And Noah builded an altar unto the Lord; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar".<a name=373:5></a> He was not told to do that, for whilst all is under command, and under divine authority, we have in Christ that which pleases God infinitely; that is to say, the outgoings of His heart Godward.<a name=373:6></a> He offered Himself without spot to God for a sweet-smelling savour.<a name=373:7></a> Personally, as a Man He was delightful here: great enough to include all these thoughts of God for another world; but He was delightful to God as to His inner, motives.<a name=373:8></a> And so the rearing up of the altar was Noah's action; he did it of himself.<a name=373:9></a> Not that he did it independently, nor that the Lord Jesus ever did anything independently, as we read in John, "the Son can do nothing of himself".<a name=373:10></a> Even the laying down of His life was as under orders: "I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.<a name=373:11></a> This commandment have I received of my Father", (<a href="../bible/John.htm#10:18">John  10:18</a>).<a name=373:12></a> But He would lay it down.<a name=373:13></a> "Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life", verse 17.<a name=373:14></a> It was His motive, it was the spring of love within; and that was what was so delightful to God, obedience unto death, the obedience of love -- "Not my will, but thine, be done", (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22:42">Luke  22:42</a>).<a name=373:15></a> But the altar is built by Noah himself, and the clean creatures were of his own selection.<a name=373:16></a> It is to bring out in type the delightfulness of Christ as entering into death, for the heart of God, so that he smelt "a savour of rest".<a name=373:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now you see God, not only in His authority, but in His restfulness in His delight in Christ; and not only a living Christ, but a Christ who entered into death, so

		that a savour went up into the nostrils of God.<a name=374:1></a> That is the position, and it is important to see that God today (this is a picture of the present moment) is operating in relation to a scene or order of things marked by the savour of Christ risen from the dead, and in which His will is absolute; even Noah does not move out of the ark without it.<a name=374:2></a> Christ came out of death by the power of God; "raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father", it was the action of the Father; and God is so delighted with Christ as having offered Himself without spot, that the whole of mankind is now viewed in another way entirely by God, for Christ is Head of all.<a name=374:3></a> The position of mankind is altered in the mind of God.<a name=374:4></a> He has been looking at men from a different viewpoint from the time that Christ rose from the dead.<a name=374:5></a> The world, as <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11">Romans  11</a>shows, is in reconciliation.<a name=374:6></a> Not that its lawlessness is ignored, but that God is taking up man in Christ; He is so delighted with Christ as having given Himself a ransom for all, that He is now viewing man not in the attitude of a Judge -- although wrath is revealed, but God is keeping that in the background -- He is glorified in Christ and He looks at every man from that point of view.<a name=374:7></a> He smelt a sweet savour and said in His heart: "I will not again curse the ground .<a name=374:8></a>.<a name=374:9></a>.<a name=374:10></a> .<a name=374:11></a>.<a name=374:12></a>.<a name=374:13></a> for man's sake".<a name=374:14></a> Think of what is in the heart of God!<a name=374:15></a> We often speak of the love of His heart, "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life", (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:16">John  3:16</a>); but think of what God <i>has mind</i> in His heart -- this is most deeply interesting: "I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake", verse 21.<a name=374:16></a> He says: I know what is in man's heart, not withstanding I am offering to men salvation and eternal life in My Son.<a name=374:17></a> He knows their hearts are only evil continually.<a name=374:18></a> He says here: "For the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth".<a name=374:19></a>

		In reading these scriptures I am thinking of the manner of divine support, especially in circumstances such as those in which we are, or are likely to be; all that I have in view centring in the statements regarding the angel of the Lord standing by, or the Lord standing by.<a name=383:1></a> I hope to be able to group my thoughts under four heads: first, the angel standing by; then as in Luke, the angel being there by them; then the angel standing by Paul; and finally the Lord standing with him.<a name=383:2></a> These are most interesting records of divine support afforded to the people of God, and first, in regard of adjustment.<a name=383:3></a> We shall find ourselves, if we have not already in need of adjusting support.<a name=383:4></a> The need may be humiliating, but apart from the support accorded we shall remain unadjusted; and disregard of adjustment from God time at least, from the service of God.<a name=383:5></a>

		Joshua is regarded in <a href="../bible/Zechariah.htm#3">Zechariah  3</a>as the high priest, so he was in the position of service; but he sorely required adjustment and was where it was available.<a name=383:6></a> He was standing "before the angel of the Lord, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him".<a name=383:7></a> We are reminded, therefore, that in the need of adjustment we are confronted, not only with the influence of our own feelings and, it may be, our own wills, but with the direct opposition of Satan.<a name=383:8></a> He is concerned that the adjustment should not take place; for if it does not take place, we are for ever disqualified for this service; or if we continue in it, we discredit it, and discredit the God

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is well if God protests in our souls; for whilst we may be amenable up to a point for adjustment, we may not be ready for a further process, whereas God is bent upon perfecting us.<a name=385:6></a> He goes the whole way with us; and at times in the process, a protest is necessary.<a name=385:7></a> So it says here, "The angel of the Lord protested unto Joshua, saying.<a name=385:8></a> Thus saith the Lord of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by".<a name=385:9></a> He is now dealing directly with Joshua, to bring him entirely under the will of God, and into accord with the divine current -- the current of the Spirit of God.<a name=385:10></a>

		I am dwelling on this point of adjustment, for it is of real importance.<a name=385:11></a> If we do not need it now, it will certain by come up.<a name=385:12></a> Indeed, the need of adjustment is constant, especially with young Christians.<a name=385:13></a> I have often thought and said, that generally we need several conversions; certainly the apostle Peter had two, and we need not assume that we are immune.<a name=385:14></a> Generally we need more than one conversion, for conversion means turning round.<a name=385:15></a> So here in the case of this servant, Joshua the high priest -- we have the protest of the Lord; that is to say.<a name=385:16></a> God insists on a walk in His ways as imperative, if we have to do with His house, and to

		Some of us are too local, others it may be are too universal; there is constant need of balance; but the idea of persons walking obviously indicates that some do travel.<a name=386:12></a> Some of us are privileged to travel literally, in standing by, or seeking to stand by, the interests of the Lord on earth.<a name=386:13></a> Others may not be privileged in that way -- most are not -- but if we do not literally travel about the world to stand by the interests of Christ, we may certainly do so in our prayers, and perhaps that is the most effective way.<a name=386:14></a> There are many travelling in that way.<a name=386:15></a> It is divine; the ways are made, the Lord Jesus has led the way in traversing the world in prayer.<a name=386:16></a> "I do not demand for these only, but also for those who believe on me through their word", (<a href="../bible/John.htm#17:20">John  17:20</a>).<a name=386:17></a> You see what a wide scope the Lord had in His prayers,

		Now in Luke it is not adjustment that is in view; but we have shepherds keeping their flock by night.<a name=387:11></a> They belong to a class that began with Abel; they belong to the shepherd class led by such men as Abel and Jacob and Moses and David, all foreshadowing the great and good Shepherd.<a name=387:12></a> We have therefore, the saints represented as belonging to this unselfish class; for a shepherd presents the idea of unselfish occupation; a very fine position to be found in Moses, as a type, helps as to this.<a name=387:13></a> In contrast to Jacob he sought no wages; nor did he become a sharer in the ownership of the flock.<a name=387:14></a> No true lover of Christ will seek to share in the ownership of the flock.<a name=387:15></a> Sometimes we hear people pretending to serve speak of <i>their</i> flock; the Lord Jesus resents that.<a name=387:16></a> It is the flock of God; it belongs to the true Shepherd who laid down His life for the sheep; who brought all His own together, so that there should

		J.T.<a name=394:1></a> These scriptures suggest unity under three heads: first, in relation to the covenant; then in relation to the kingdom; and then in relation to life.<a name=394:2></a> The Lord, I believe, will help us in considering this subject thus, for they are incentives to unity, which is an essential feature with God in all His dealings with His people, and He promotes it in every way as introducing it among us.<a name=394:3></a> We may see in Exodus the connection with the covenant; Moses, as you will observe, setting up an altar and twelve pillars "according to the twelve tribes of Israel", verse 4.<a name=394:4></a> It was an opportune time for the introduction of the idea of unity among the saints, for they had just had the experience of deliverance out of Egypt, and of God's covenant opening up His heart to them, in type, at least, so that they are ready to undertake to keep their part in the covenant.<a name=394:5></a> It says, "And Moses came and told the people all the words of Jehovah, and all the judgments; and all the people answered with one voice, and said.<a name=394:6></a> All the words that Jehovah has said will we do!<a name=394:7></a>" They were undertaking unitedly, "with one voice", to keep the covenant; as if their hearts were under the influence of what had been set before them in the deliverance out of Egypt, and particularly from the mount.<a name=394:8></a> Then "Moses wrote all the words of Jehovah" for the people, they having undertaken to keep them; and then he sets up the pillars.<a name=394:9></a> He "rose up early in the morning, and built an altar under the mountain, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel", as if from their side there was the acceptance of the covenant; then the altar indicating their readiness for sacrifice, at least in the mind of Moses; and then the pillars denoting the unity of the tribes as in the mind of God.<a name=394:10></a> For unity is not simply a matter of one meeting, or meetings in a district or country; the

		J.T.<a name=398:9></a> Yes, you get variety in the details.<a name=398:10></a> In the opening of this remarkable scripture you have the direction given to Moses, "Go up to Jehovah, thou and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel".<a name=398:11></a> Then in verse 9, "And Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel went up, and they saw the God of Israel; and there was under his feet as it were work of transparent sapphire, and as it were the form of heaven for clearness.<a name=398:12></a> And on the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: they saw God, and ate and drank".<a name=398:13></a> That is, you have these pillars and the sprinkling of the blood, clothed in the suggestion of heavenly dignity; that they were to go up with it to the mount of God, and they were to be ennobled; they are called 'nobles', and they eat and drink, and see "the God of Israel".<a name=398:14></a> So we are surrounded here with wonderful incentives to practical unity.<a name=398:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		John is taking young believers (I am speaking to them particularly now) out of the range of men, for it is a question of men as such in this chapter, he tells them that antichrist is coming, and that there are many antichrists.<a name=411:6></a> Young people, going to schools and officer may be unaware of the influences that are being exerted abroad -- subtle influences in many respects -- to shut out Christ from their minds by bringing in man, and the sayings and teachings of man.<a name=411:7></a> So the first word here in regard to the Spirit is "Ye have an unction from the Holy One" -- not a degree, or degrees, according to man, but "an unction".<a name=411:8></a> A university degree gives a certain dignity to a man; the letters at the end of a name are intended to convey dignity and authority.<a name=411:9></a> Now, what we have here is that, only it is "an unction from the Holy One"; not that any Christian would assume anything, but the point here is the dignity of the believer, even the youngest, as having the Holy Spirit; that the means of his learning and the character of his knowledge, is by the unction from the Holy One.<a name=411:10></a> Now that brings me down to what is very practical, and that is that all that is <i>merely</i> human, natural intellect and natural ability, is to be shut out from our mode of learning, and our mode of speaking

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=433:7></a> Evidently in the section from verse 17 of chapter 11 to the end of this chapter, we are occupied with what governs us inside as gathered.<a name=433:8></a> It is the assembly in function; not simply all the assembly come into one place, but in functional relation.<a name=433:9></a> Then we have the body in chapter 12, the chapter deals with "spiritual manifestations", in connection with which we have the Spirit, and the Lord, and God, in verses 4,5 and 6; so fully comparing chapter 12.<a name=433:10></a> Chapter 13 is the power in a moral way for operation, so that we can function according to God; and hence following after love would mean that we think of it first, and all the time, as gathered together; for unless that be in evidence, there would be the tendency for each of us to isolate himself in the exercise of his gift.<a name=433:11></a> The large place the apostle gives to prophecy as over against tongues, in following after love, would be to save us from isolation in thought in our service in the assembly.<a name=433:12></a> It may not seem so easy, especially if a man has gift, as he sits down with his brethren to think of himself in relation to the others.<a name=433:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=448:10></a> As has been suggested.<a name=448:11></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#87">Psalm  87</a>helps us as to the persons born in Zion.<a name=448:12></a> Perhaps we might enlarge on the personality side in these appearings according to their order; the first appearing here is an allusion to material very different from that current at Corinth; What was current in the world as marking off persons was accepted among the saints at Corinth.<a name=448:13></a> 'Cephas' is not that, it is not acquired in this world, it is a personality acquired from Christ.<a name=448:14></a> It is not Peter but Cephas; it is the word used by the Lord in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:42">John  1:42</a>.<a name=448:15></a> It is a question of the person more than the material; it is material, but the kind of person that includes the material.<a name=448:16></a> It is to shut out personal distinction acquired in the world, that that should not gain recognition in the church.<a name=448:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=448:21></a> Yes, so as to <i>impress</i> him.<a name=448:22></a> If one ponders what it is to have the Lord appear to one personally, a definite impression would be received; it would shut out any distinction that the world could confer.<a name=448:23></a> It is exclusive, because the word really denotes material.<a name=448:24></a> It shews what Peter was according to Matthew, but denotes also what he was to be called, according to John.<a name=448:25></a> You have what the man is, and then what the man is to be <i>called</i>; hence if I am on this line, I do not think of a brother in connection with the distinction he has acquired in this world.<a name=448:26></a>

		J.T.<a name=449:1></a> So Matthew gives the material, and John the personal distinction, in that the Lord says, "Thou shalt be called Cephas".<a name=449:2></a> But then Luke brings in the idea of personality at once.<a name=449:3></a> In speaking to Theophilus he almost immediately introduces a great heavenly dignitary.<a name=449:4></a> It is peculiar to Luke that you have a heavenly dignitary introduced by name.<a name=449:5></a> Well, what would the "most excellent Theophilus" be alongside of that person?<a name=449:6></a> I mean, he would have to think of that.<a name=449:7></a> He was excellent of course, but that excellency is dropped in the Acts.<a name=449:8></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have been thinking, dear brethren, of this enquiry in <a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#4">Joshua  4</a>; one, doubtless, which most of us have noticed: "What mean ye by these stones?<a name=460:1></a>" In the light of this enquiry I have read in Exodus first, for we have to understand what the stones in Exodus mean, as well as those in Joshua.<a name=460:2></a> In fact it is well to be challenged as to whether we can answer such questions when they come to us, for this is not written down in a merely historic way.<a name=460:3></a> The book of Joshua is typical of Christians, and the enquiry may therefore be rightly made at any time in our dispensation, "What mean <i>ye</i> by these stones?<a name=460:4></a>" They represent something that Christians have as memorials, and anything of the kind that we have, or employ, in our public relations with God and one another, ought to be intelligible and explainable.<a name=460:5></a> According to the margin, verse 6, the enquiry might be made tomorrow, that is immediately, from that time onward, "What mean ye by these stones?<a name=460:6></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I wish to apply all this to Exodus.<a name=460:7></a> Indeed it may be applied to Genesis too, and other books of Scripture, for the idea of stones is very prominent in the Scriptures.<a name=460:8></a> It is alluded to in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#11">Genesis  11</a>as you will remember, stones <i>not</i> being used by the world's builders.<a name=460:9></a> They employed bricks instead of stone, shewing that they were not in the understanding of the import of stone.<a name=460:10></a> Their material was of their own making.<a name=460:11></a> The obvious inference is that their building would not be permanent, in the nature of things it would not last.<a name=460:12></a> The world comes to an end.<a name=460:13></a> It passes away and the lust thereof, but he that doeth the will of God abides for eternity.<a name=460:14></a> They were not doing the will of God.<a name=460:15></a> A man said to his fellow, "Come on, let us build ourselves a city and a tower, the top of which may reach to the heavens; and let us make ourselves a name".<a name=460:16></a> They were not doing the

		will of God, they were world builders; and their successors have continued, using material of their own making, which will not last.<a name=461:1></a> But stones are of God's making.<a name=461:2></a> In Scripture it clearly alludes to what is permanent, and that is what I wish to dwell upon.<a name=461:3></a> It is what we are going on with in our meetings.<a name=461:4></a> The things engaging us would be of little value if they were not permanent.<a name=461:5></a> What occupies us may be very foolish in the eyes of our religious neighbours, but it is permanent, and is the working out of the will of God.<a name=461:6></a> The Lord stresses the idea of doing the will of God.<a name=461:7></a> He brought the full idea of it into the world and exemplified it in every respect.<a name=461:8></a> It underlies all moral worth.<a name=461:9></a> He came, saying, "Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me), to do thy will, O God".<a name=461:10></a> This -- the will of God -- underlies all moral worth, and he that does it "abides for ever".<a name=461:11></a> The world passes away, and the Babel builders in using brick for stone, wrote themselves down as building that which would pass-away.<a name=461:12></a> Although bricks may last a good while, they are man's manufacture, and cannot in the very nature of things abide unto eternity; whereas stone suggests something that abides.<a name=461:13></a> It is permanent; a substance that is in the earth, of which indeed geologists make much; but they omit from their findings the <i>moral</i> idea, which suggests permanency.<a name=461:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I speak of Exodus, first, in regard to an altar which is what each of us should have, and what we should have in a collective sense as well.<a name=461:15></a> Individual altars are found in Genesis, but no collective ones; but Exodus contemplates what is collective, a <i>people</i> with an altar.<a name=461:16></a> And so I wish to dwell on this feature, for it refers to our public relations with God.<a name=461:17></a> There are our secret relations, and I have no doubt that verse 25 may be linked up with our secret relations.<a name=461:18></a> Where God makes an altar <i>inoperative</i>, He wishes us to be known here as His worshippers; so He first specifies an altar <i>earth</i>.<a name=461:19></a> There is no 'if' to that altar, it <i>is</i> to be made; as you will observe

	<div class="paragraph">
		in chapter 20:24, "An altar of earth shalt thou make unto me".<a name=462:1></a> It alludes to our public relations with God, as those who worship Him; and we acknowledge in it what we are -- earth.<a name=462:2></a> But then that would be of no value if our Lord Jesus Christ had not come as Man.<a name=462:3></a> Altars might be made without recognition of Him, they would be of no value whatever.<a name=462:4></a> The altar of earth therefore, contemplates our acknowledgment of what we are and that our Lord Jesus Christ becoming Man has met, that condition.<a name=462:5></a> It has been met, in that in Him, as made sin, sin in the flesh was condemned, and that He "bare our sins in his own body on the tree", (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:24">1 Peter  2:24</a>).<a name=462:6></a> He was "crucified in weakness, yet he lives by God's power", (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#13:4">2 Corinthians  13:4</a>).<a name=462:7></a> He was "put to death in flesh but made alive in the Spirit", (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#3:18">1 Peter  3:18</a>); so there is in the altar of earth, in our approach to God, the acknowledgment before Him of what we are by nature, and how that is met.<a name=462:8></a> We can offer on it, as it says, "Thy burnt-offerings, and thy peace-offerings, thy sheep and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee and I will bless thee".<a name=462:9></a> There we see, dear brethren, how God comes to us.<a name=462:10></a> The Lord comes to us, in this humble but public acknowledgment of what we are by nature, and that we approach God, through our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=462:11></a> Our burnt-offerings, our peace-offerings, our sheep and our oxen, represent the spiritual wealth that we possess; the spiritual apprehension of Christ is accepted and owned there, for He comes to us -- a very precious thought.<a name=462:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then in verse 25, there is an 'if', and that refers to <i>spiritual ability</i>, whether we can build an altar of stone.<a name=462:13></a> The alter of earth is enough to give us a status before God, but it does not carry us to the <i>full</i> length which divine love would seek, and therefore, as I said, it is a question of spiritual ability if we make an altar of stone.<a name=462:14></a> If we do that we have in our minds an additional thing, the idea of permanency; for our present mixed condition

		I wish now to pass on to chapter 28, and surely we may ask, "What mean <i>these</i> stones?<a name=465:3></a>" It is not now simply an ordinary stone, suggesting permanency, but a <i>precious</i> stone, and an array of them.<a name=465:4></a> For indeed when it comes to ourselves it is "every precious stone".<a name=465:5></a> In Ezekiel we read of precious stones.<a name=465:6></a> The king of Tyre, chapter 28, is adorned with "every precious stone", but there are only nine enumerated.<a name=465:7></a> There are more in connection with the heavenly city, and more here, for there are twelve.<a name=465:8></a> What a suggestion in these precious stones; not only of permanency, but of preciousness in permanency; preciousness in the divine estimate, for God has placed these things in His creation, for a language.<a name=465:9></a> The Scriptures abound with the use of created things as a language, as a means of conveying divine thoughts and in order to make things clear to us.<a name=465:10></a> The types are alluded to in Hebrews as the means through which the Spirit <i>shews</i> things to us.<a name=465:11></a> These things were to <i>shew</i> forth divine thoughts, not only for Him to speak through them, but to <i>shew</i> through them.<a name=465:12></a> It says in Hebrews that He <i>speaks</i> "As says the Holy Spirit", (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#3:7">Hebrews  3:7</a>); and shews, "The Holy Spirit shewing this", (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9:8">Hebrews  9:8</a>); and <i>witness</i>, "The Holy Spirit also bears us witness", (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:15">Hebrews  10:15</a>), all by the use of the Old Testament.<a name=465:13></a>

		J.T.<a name=470:1></a> This is a well-known chapter, but I feel there are some features in it which the Lord would emphasise for us at this time.<a name=470:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first feature to which I would call attention is that the Lord dismissed the multitude.<a name=470:3></a> In this gospel we have to distinguish between His leaving certain positions or persons, and His relations with the multitude.<a name=470:4></a> In the beginning of the chapter, verse 1, He is said to have gone out from the house.<a name=470:5></a> We have to distinguish between this house, alluding to the Jewish system, which had now manifested itself as reprobate, and the crowd, who were still interested in what He was saying.<a name=470:6></a> The house in the beginning of the chapter, refers to the state of things disclosed in chapter 12, an organisation in which Satan has a footing.<a name=470:7></a> The Lord leaves that; but there is the crowd or multitude, who attend to what He is saying.<a name=470:8></a> Analogously there is that today which has proved itself reprobate in regard to Christ; but there is also the crowd, who are more or less interested; and we have to attend to them.<a name=470:9></a> The Lord still regards them, although speaking parabolically to them.<a name=470:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second house, referred to in verse 36, is where He expounds all things; and where we get disclosures as to the church, although it is not actually named.<a name=470:11></a> I suggested the passage because I believe it covers our position now; first in relation to that which has proved faithless to Christ; next in relation to the multitude; and then in connection with what we have inside the second house.<a name=470:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		F.S.<a name=470:13></a>M.<a name=470:14></a> Would the second house answer at all to the fellowship today?<a name=470:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And so it is that today.<a name=483:10></a> God has imposed effective checks to current movements affecting His interests, and will do so; for the angelic ministry is a part of the divine provision, not only in regard to the needs of our bodies, but in regard to the government of the world -- in our favour.<a name=483:11></a> They are sent out, as we read, "for service on account of those who shall inherit salvation".<a name=483:12></a> Through them we have effective checks, so that men cannot do just what they wish to do.<a name=483:13></a> We see God coming in constantly to limit human enterprise and operations, so that there may be room for the people of God; that the testimony of God may move on.<a name=483:14></a> That, indeed.<a name=483:15></a> God may continue to have the gospel announced to men -- for He is very concerned that there should be no change in that;

		In Genesis God gives the line of Shem before the effort at Shinar; and then after He has broken up that effort, and scattered man abroad on the face of the whole earth.<a name=484:2></a> He returns to the line of Shem, the line of the testimony.<a name=484:3></a> It is as if God would say to His people, 'I will make a way for you', and that runs right down to the present moment.<a name=484:4></a> He would not have us occupied with current events in the world, save in the sense that God is moving in them.<a name=484:5></a> The line of the testimony is the important thing, the line of Shem.<a name=484:6></a> In this line appears Abraham, and in Abraham we have the great progenitor of the family of faith -- "the father of all them that believe".<a name=484:7></a> Something is introduced, on that principle, before which nothing can stand.<a name=484:8></a> "If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed", the Lord says, "ye shall say unto this mountain.<a name=484:9></a> Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you", (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#17:20">Matthew  17:20</a>).<a name=484:10></a> A little dynamite breaks up a rock, and a little faith will cast a mountain into the sea.<a name=484:11></a> That is what God introduces.<a name=484:12></a> There was faith there before -- in Abel and others; but now there is a progenitor and a family; and through that family God will uproot, dissolve, and set aside all among men that is against Him.<a name=484:13></a>

		The word 'book' is important in this gospel, for it reminds us of another book, of which the Lord spoke, referred to above.<a name=487:4></a> There was in it the testimony to His unqualified obedience; the foundation of all that is of any moral worth, is in that book.<a name=487:5></a> And this gospel begins with the word 'book'.<a name=487:6></a> The ram was caught by his horns behind Abraham; and Abraham availed himself of what there was.<a name=487:7></a> And then he names the place, having offered up the ram.<a name=487:8></a> He calls the place 'Jehovah-jireh', and then it says, "As it is said at the present day.<a name=487:9></a> On the mount of Jehovah will be provided".<a name=487:10></a> That enters into what I am speaking of.<a name=487:11></a> The power of the saying of a man who is in faith lives.<a name=487:12></a> As you find with Samuel, none of his words fell to the ground.<a name=487:13></a> How true that is of the Lord Jesus!<a name=487:14></a> Think of all the utterances of Christ!<a name=487:15></a> What we have <i>written</i>, is relatively small.<a name=487:16></a> We have enough to guide our faith; but the Lord said that the Father would send the Holy Spirit in His name, and He would bring to their remembrance, whatever He had said to them.<a name=487:17></a> And so here you have the continuance of this saying of Abraham.<a name=487:18></a> How it would come home to the heart of Moses, who in his great service had to do with the mount of the Lord!<a name=487:19></a> He could say with special force, "On the mount of Jehovah will be provided".<a name=487:20></a> Have we learnt to say it, to take up as from our hearts these words of faith?<a name=487:21></a> The young people are to be nourished on them, brought up on them!<a name=487:22></a> At times we may not see a resource anywhere, but it is "in the mount of the Lord".<a name=487:23></a> We need to get our souls into the current of faith.<a name=487:24></a> Things are all carried down as in a current; and as you get into the current, there is no despondency; you see the abundance of divine resources and where they

		So you can see how important the mount of the Lord is, and I take the gospel of Matthew to be representative of the idea; for it is a gospel marked by mountains, six of which are used by the Lord, in His relations with His own.<a name=488:8></a> Satan used one, but he took the Lord up there, so that you can connect the Lord with the seven of them: "As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about his people.<a name=488:9></a>", (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#125:2">Psalm  125:2</a>).<a name=488:10></a> Matthew is the mountain gospel; and that means it is a gospel of energy, for energy is needed to ascend elevations.<a name=488:11></a> And if I belong to the generation of Abraham, I have got that energy.<a name=488:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		In connection with the last mountain in Matthew, after the Lord was risen.<a name=489:10></a> He directed the eleven disciples to meet Him there.<a name=489:11></a> It was a mountain in Galilee; He would (by the distance to be travelled) test our energy and our loyalty: for it is the King in Matthew.<a name=489:12></a> They "went into Galilee to the mountain which Jesus had appointed them", and the Lord "coming up spoke to".<a name=489:13></a> They got well repaid for their journey: they met the King, and they got a commission, the like of which you find nowhere else.<a name=489:14></a> It is the proposal of the King, "Make disciples of all the nations, baptising them to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit; teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have enjoined you.<a name=489:15></a> And behold, <i>I</i> am with you all the days, until the completion of the age".<a name=489:16></a> What energy is implied in this commission!<a name=489:17></a> In (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#19:16">Revelation  19:16</a>), He comes forth and on his thigh is a name written which means the power that He has to effect complete universal subjection -- "King of kings and Lord of lords".<a name=489:18></a>

		I am thinking particularly of treasure, and of each one of us possessing treasure, and of how it may be possessed.<a name=493:1></a> The divine thought for us is that we should be possessed of wealth; that we should not only have enough to live on, but <i>affluence</i>.<a name=493:2></a> What marks the world today economically, is living and making a show on the principle <i>of credit</i>.<a name=493:3></a> The idea of living on current income seems to have largely passed.<a name=493:4></a> The world has drifted into a position of dependence on the future; many are living on their capital: others, as I have said, living on future earnings on the principle of credit.<a name=493:5></a> This nation as a whole may be regarded in that light, as living on its capital and not on its immediate earnings; and of course there can be no accumulation of national wealth thus.<a name=493:6></a> God would not have it so with His people; He would have us to pay our debts (according to the type) with the oil as sold, and to live on the rest, <a href="../bible/2Kings.htm#4">2 Kings  4</a>.<a name=493:7></a> That, to say the least, there should be a means of livelihood without borrowing on the <i>possible</i> future.<a name=493:8></a> As I said.<a name=493:9></a> God would have us to live, spiritually, not only comfortably but in affluence; and to have enough for <i>treasuries</i>.<a name=493:10></a> And so I wish to speak of treasure, and that we all should be possessed of it, we may be and we <i>should</i> be.<a name=493:11></a> I would also shew, the Lord helping me, the way of the acquirement of wealth; so that there might be over against the principles of the world, the principles of God -- the economy of God, the resources of God; and the consequent manifested enrichment of His people.<a name=493:12></a>

		Now, speaking of the thing from <i>the</i> divine side first, to confirm what I am saying, in the book of Proverbs we have the statement that wisdom walks in the path of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment: so as to cause those who love her to inherit substance, chapter 8:20,21.<a name=493:13></a> Then it adds: "and I will fill their treasuries".<a name=493:14></a>

		The first source of wealth, I may say, is the inheritance, and the formation of income consequent on the inheritance <i>is our</i> side.<a name=494:1></a> In the Authorised Version, wisdom says: "I <i>lead</i> in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment", and the force of the passage is shewing the <i>way</i>, and that does not mean borrowing.<a name=494:2></a> It indicates, beloved brethren, the way wisdom took, with the end in view of those who love her inheriting substance.<a name=494:3></a> It cost wisdom something.<a name=494:4></a> Coming into this world the Lord had to face what was in it.<a name=494:5></a> There was only one way, and that was the way of righteousness, He <i>loved</i> righteousness.<a name=494:6></a> He did not institute the idea of borrowing; He restored that which He took not away.<a name=494:7></a> He did not evade anything in that sense.<a name=494:8></a> What was needful for the end in view He accepted; that is to say, the way of righteousness and the paths of judgment.<a name=494:9></a> One could enlarge on that, for it involves the death of Christ.<a name=494:10></a> As the apostle says most touchingly, "For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich".<a name=494:11></a> It is in his <i>second</i> letter to the Corinthians he says that.<a name=494:12></a> You see the way and at what a cost, possible riches, an inheritance, has I been secured and brought into evidence for us.<a name=494:13></a> It is that we should inherit <i>substance</i> and that our treasuries should become full.<a name=494:14></a>

		The epistle to the Colossians speaks of "the treasures, of wisdom and knowledge", chapter 2:3, but these are hidden in the mystery, and that is not far away.<a name=494:15></a> The mystery is not merely theoretic; it refers (to be simple) to yourself and the brother next to you, or to myself and the brother next to me.<a name=494:16></a> It is in the use, so to speak, that we make thus of our neighbouring or local brethren that we find the way to this class of treasure, "the treasures of wisdom and knowledge".<a name=494:17></a> What the Greeks would have considered exclusive to a few, in their way of looking at it, is available, you see, in the mystery.<a name=494:18></a> I only touch on

		Reading the greater part of this chapter, I have no intention of enlarging on all the blessings; each of them would furnish sufficient substance for an address.<a name=503:1></a> My thought is that in reading this chapter.<a name=503:2></a> God may come before us and bathe our souls in the richness of His thoughts of us and for us, through the varied blessings indicated; for it has to be borne in mind that these blessings are for us all.<a name=503:3></a> It is not that you are to be blessed with one blessing and I with another: God's blessings are the outcome of His love, and He is not a respecter of persons in showering them upon us.<a name=503:4></a> We are all in His mind: indeed, as believers, we were in His mind before the world was, and the Spirit of God says that He has blessed us with "every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ", (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:3">Ephesians  1:3</a>).<a name=503:5></a> We have not only every spiritual blessing that any of the blest families shall have, but we have them, and more besides, where some of them will not have any, that is, "in the heavenlies".<a name=503:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that is what I have in mind, dear brethren, so that my hope is, not only that we may have a word from the Lord, but that there should be a sense of the richness of divine blessings; that our souls may be, as it were, touched and bathed, in them.<a name=503:7></a> I am encouraged to go as far as using the word 'bathed' because in the gospel of Luke, heaven came down in volume and encircled the shepherds who were keeping their sheep by night; they were evidently the objects of heaven's interest.<a name=503:8></a> It is said that "an angel of the Lord was there by them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them"; they were thus honoured by a heavenly visitant, and encircled with the glory of the Lord.<a name=503:9></a> But as if that were not enough the Holy Spirit goes on to tell us that "suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host" -- heaven, as it were, brought down in volume to encircle

		these honoured ones, and the heavenly visitants were saying, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good pleasure in men".<a name=504:1></a> They were made to breathe the very atmosphere of heaven, and to hear what heaven was saying -- what angelic companies <i>were</i> saying: they were speaking about divine glory, and that that was now brought within man's range.<a name=504:2></a> It was there in One born unto them, not here born unto God, but unto <i>them</i> "a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord".<a name=504:3></a> That was the great fact; and the heavenly companies came down and surrounded these shepherds, speaking of this great event, that it might saturate their souls.<a name=504:4></a> That is what God will do for us, deal-brethren, for He is lavish; His thought is pouring out.<a name=504:5></a> As the apostle says "which he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ", (<a href="../bible/Titus.htm#3:6">Titus  3:6</a>).<a name=504:6></a> Heaven's wealth comes down in a mediatorial way through our Lord Jesus Christ, so as to <i>fill</i> our souls, as it says in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>, "they were all filled with the Holy Spirit".<a name=504:7></a> It sat upon each of them, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, for He fills every available vessel; and they "began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave to them to speak forth".<a name=504:8></a>

		Now this chapter is on that line.<a name=504:9></a> You will observe it opens with: "And this is <i>the</i> blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.<a name=504:10></a> And he said .<a name=504:11></a>.<a name=504:12></a>.<a name=504:13></a>".<a name=504:14></a> He does not begin with the children of Israel, he begins with God; as you might expect, for he was "the man of God".<a name=504:15></a> The more we know of God the more we love Him, and the more we love to hear about Him; not only of our own blessings but about Him, for our blessings are all bound up with the knowledge of God; all our blessings centre in the knowledge of God, and we would not have it otherwise.<a name=504:16></a> So Moses begins with God.<a name=504:17></a> "Jehovah came from Sinai, And rose up from their unto them; He shone forth from mount Paran, and he came from the myriads of the sanctuary".<a name=504:18></a> That is to say, we have God in His own

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the passage goes on to speak of the law, "the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob", verse 4.<a name=506:8></a> You see it is an inheritance; the law is not presented here as exacting, or as bringing the knowledge of sin, but with spiritual significance, as conveying the thoughts of God.<a name=506:9></a> It is "the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob".<a name=506:10></a> God is in His place and we worship Him there; we are reverential towards Him as He is there.<a name=506:11></a> We are in our place and He loves us there: that is.<a name=506:12></a> God is God, and man is man.<a name=506:13></a> God loves man and man loves God.<a name=506:14></a> That is the eternal setting of things.<a name=506:15></a> It is from this setting we have the blessing; and I wish to speak of these blessings as bearing on us all, each of them referring to us all.<a name=506:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The first blessing is life.<a name=506:17></a> It is not exactly what we speak of eternal life, but life as the power of movement, that which shews itself in our movements, so that instead of dying, instead of being irresponsive to God, we are alive -- "Let Reuben live, and not die".<a name=506:18></a> God loves life; He loves it in its fruits in its movements.<a name=506:19></a> Our Lord Jesus was said to "grow up before him as a tender

		The next blessing is for Judah, whose voice is to be heard.<a name=507:9></a> These meetings are very largely for young people, and the first thing, dear young people, is this movement of life, as seen in Reuben; not natural energy which goes in for sports and other pleasures of this world.<a name=507:10></a> Such evidences of natural life are not marks of the blessing of God; but belong to Esau's world, for he was "a man of the field".<a name=507:11></a> "Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents"; he was indeed spiritual, as his history shows.<a name=507:12></a> He did not develop sporting energy or skill, that was not his aim; he belonged to the spiritual family, the family of faith, and he dwelt in tents.<a name=507:13></a> There dwelt with him one of the most honoured men in the Old Testament, his grandfather Abraham who "dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob".<a name=507:14></a> You get no such company as that in the field, or on the tennis court the man of faith did not go there; that was Esau's place and he despised his birthright.<a name=507:15></a> "Let Reuben live, and not die"; the blessing here is life.<a name=507:16></a> The movements of the man of faith are delightful to God; he is in a place of obscurity in this world, not in a palace,

		But I have got to Judah: "Hear, Lord, the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people", verse 7.<a name=508:3></a> This, no doubt, has a dispensational bearing, but I am not speaking of that, but that you, dear young people, should be brought to <i>your</i> people.<a name=508:4></a> The world does not afford your people.<a name=508:5></a> Ruth says: "Thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God".<a name=508:6></a> That is the idea here.<a name=508:7></a> Then "may his hands strive for them", as it may read.<a name=508:8></a> Now, you see, you are brought amongst the saints.<a name=508:9></a> Is there anyone here who has confessed the Lord who has not put out his hands for fellowship with God's people?<a name=508:10></a> There may be some of such here.<a name=508:11></a> You have the movements of life maybe, for the Spirit of God is given to those who believe on the Lord Jesus, and there are the consequent movements of life, but the next thing is to be brought to your people.<a name=508:12></a> They will be ready, no doubt, to put their Hands upon you, as Ananias did upon Saul, as you seek to identify yourself with Him.<a name=508:13></a> "Hear, Lord, the voice of Judah"; that is those prayers in your closet to God for guidance, for spiritual companionship -- these are heard.<a name=508:14></a> You remember how Saul's praying was his commendation: the Lord said "Behold, he prayeth", and surely his voice was heard.<a name=508:15></a> He says, too, that Saul saw in a vision a man coming and laying his hands on him.<a name=508:16></a> The Lord knew all that was going on in Saul's heart, as well as his voice, and he was brought to his people.<a name=508:17></a> He got strength, having taken food, and was with the disciples certain days.<a name=508:18></a> They were his companions; great man though he had been in Jerusalem, he is now a companion of the lowly followers of Jesus, in Damascus; and he soon moves his hand to help them, for he begins to preach that is the next thing.<a name=508:19></a> The next blessing is that of Levi.<a name=508:20></a> We are led on in

		this wonderful chapter from blessing to blessing, one blessing added to another, increasing as it goes; the next after Judah, is Levi.<a name=509:1></a> Levi is the spiritual side.<a name=509:2></a> You can understand that the blessings of Reuben and Judah, combined in one would make a man spiritual; he would think for God and help His people; of Judah it is said, "May his hands strive for them".<a name=509:3></a> We have no past history in Reuben nor in Judah here, but in Levi you have past history: there can be no levitical service without past history.<a name=509:4></a> The typical Levite is Aaron; he was eighty-three years old before we hear of him by name, and that implies past history with God.<a name=509:5></a> "Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy Holy one", God knows that you are holy now that you are beginning to think for Him, and becoming a priest; in your prayers you are priestly, you are thinking of the saints, of the honour of God in His people, and God says as it were 'I will trust him with my Thummim and my Urim' -- which is perfections and light.<a name=509:6></a> They were set in the breastplate of the high priest.<a name=509:7></a> Levi includes the priesthood.<a name=509:8></a> It is the priestly family.<a name=509:9></a> It says of him here "Whom thou didst prove at Massah, and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah".<a name=509:10></a> He is proved, he has past history with God.<a name=509:11></a> As soon as you begin to make spiritual history.<a name=509:12></a> God loves to go over the ground you have covered.<a name=509:13></a> As soon as one repents he begins to make history in heaven, and surely history is begun in his own soul as well.<a name=509:14></a> The history of our souls is kept in heaven, and God loves to go over it; it reflects the operations of His grace in us.<a name=509:15></a>

		The next is Benjamin.<a name=510:10></a> You can understand now the place you will have with God, you will be "the beloved of the Lord".<a name=510:11></a> How precious to be the beloved of the Lord who dwells in safety by Him!<a name=510:12></a> It says: "The beloved of the Lord shall dwell in safety by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders".<a name=510:13></a> You come now into the enjoyment of the love of God.<a name=510:14></a> "The beloved of the Lord" you might say, was an expression that refers to Christ but the expressions that refer to Christ are very largely applicable to us as related to Him.<a name=510:15></a> We are blessed in Him; as He is the delight of God so we are the delight of God; as He is the beloved, so are we.<a name=510:16></a> "Accepted in the beloved" -- think of that!<a name=510:17></a> What an incentive, to go on on these lines, and come into the things that are open to you!<a name=510:18></a> And then the next thing is "He shall dwell between his shoulders".<a name=510:19></a> I have no doubt that this refers to the position of the temple in the territory of Benjamin, because the temple was literally built in his territory, Jerusalem being one of his cities at the outset.<a name=510:20></a> Much might be said about that, as to how it came into Judah's
