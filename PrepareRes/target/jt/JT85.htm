		J.T.<a name=1:2></a> Many other passages may come under review but the scriptures read cover the subject.<a name=1:3></a> The teaching of the word of the cross in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1">1 Corinthians  1</a>is to them that perish foolishness, not the cross in a literal sense which is used in certain religious circles, but the word of it, meaning that which God has furnished to open up the truth or bearing of it to us, what it means -- what it discloses, namely, that our old man has been crucified with Christ; the Lord may help us to understand what that is.<a name=1:4></a> Romans helps us as to the word of righteousness, also it has to do with the word of the cross, it unfolds the significance of the crucifixion of our old man.<a name=1:5></a> The Galatians were furnished with part of the teaching of the word of the cross, in that the one who brought it to them -- Paul -- speaks there of his own view of the matter, how it affected him.<a name=1:6></a> It is important in service to see how the truth affects the one who presents it.<a name=1:7></a> Ephesians furnishes the word of the cross in an extensive sense, and shows how both Jew and gentile are reconciled in one body -- it is collective.<a name=1:8></a> Revelation gives us a further word in regard to the two witnesses; it is a matter of witness, we are made a spectacle and may expect it where our Lord was crucified.<a name=1:9></a> However small a town or city may be, it takes on that character; it is where we are, where we break bread and carry out the truth collectively; it is where our Lord was crucified, the kind of place, the external surroundings of the crucifixion.<a name=1:10></a> Every

		J.T.<a name=2:5></a> Yes, it is a root matter.<a name=2:6></a> The word of the cross deals with the roots of evil, it deals with our pride and our aspirations and with the meanness of our old man.<a name=2:7></a> How mean we are in thoughts as we give way to our old man!<a name=2:8></a> We know what our old man is capable of, and as we judge him the word of the cross becomes valuable.<a name=2:9></a> It shows how we get rid of him in the faith of our souls and the word makes the thing intelligible to us.<a name=2:10></a>

		J.T.<a name=3:6></a> Because we get there the word of the cross; without the word the thing is not of much value, the word of a thing makes it intelligible to you.<a name=3:7></a> We get the essence of a thing first, then the word is what opens it up to your mind, the teaching of it.<a name=3:8></a> The word searches you out inwardly, and brings it to bear on you in the full scope of it in all the roots of your being.<a name=3:9></a> We get the bearing of it on oneself, what it involves, what it is to me; first we get our old man, then oneself, then the affections and lusts of the flesh.<a name=3:10></a> We are slow to lay hold of the utter meanness of our old man, the one that marked us.<a name=3:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:14></a> If you seek in ministry or teaching to make an impression by wisdom of words, it would defeat its own object, it would defeat the truth of the cross, it would becloud it, but the word of the cross is different, it is God's way of stressing the truth of it, not in wisdom of words.<a name=3:15></a> Paul is alluding to the great skill of the Greeks, their eloquence in the use of words; it is thought much of today but it is of no value in the things of God; there it is by demonstration of the Spirit and of power -- it must be by the Spirit.<a name=3:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Ques.<a name=4:4></a> Would you distinguish between perishing and lost?<a name=4:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:6></a> There is not much distinction in the result.<a name=4:7></a> We get the thought of perishing in John's gospel.<a name=4:8></a> "God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believes on him may not perish" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:16">John  3:16</a>).<a name=4:9></a> The allusion is to what happened in the wilderness to Israel: through their self-will their, carcases fell in the wilderness.<a name=4:10></a> Instead of going through in life one perishes; it is a very humiliating thought.<a name=4:11></a> The thought of carcases as attached to men is very humiliating; their carcases fell -- they were graves of lust.<a name=4:12></a> 'Lost' carries with it a state, what we were to God -- lost to Him.<a name=4:13></a> God classifies certain ones thus -- "Our gospel .<a name=4:14></a>.<a name=4:15></a>.<a name=4:16></a> is hid to them that are lost".<a name=4:17></a> They are exposed to the blinding influence of the devil; they are blinded by him; he has got them.<a name=4:18></a>

		H. Would perishing apply to believers?<a name=4:24></a>

		J.T.<a name=4:28></a> They are not types of christians characteristically.<a name=4:29></a> We are speaking here of characteristic persons.<a name=4:30></a> It is another matter, it is a solemn thing, if a christian does not care for the teaching of the cross, if it cuts too much on his natural tendency, and it is well to remember that he is bordering on that class.<a name=4:31></a>

		It is a solemn thing if he does not like the preaching and word of the cross.<a name=5:1></a> Judas was like that; he was a son of perdition and he died in a gruesome sort of way; it was a humiliating thing.<a name=5:2></a> How solemn it is for a christian to shrink from the word of the cross, to say, in his attitude, that it is too exacting!<a name=5:3></a> It may be the word of the cross cuts at the very root of things.<a name=5:4></a> How solemn it is if a christian is in that attitude of mind to shrink from it!<a name=5:5></a> How near he is to that class who perish!<a name=5:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		C. Is there not a danger with us of tolerating, of not accepting it fully?<a name=5:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:11></a> Yes.<a name=5:12></a> To die with Christ is one thing but to be crucified with Christ is another.<a name=5:13></a> The cross was the scandal of that day.<a name=5:14></a> The Corinthians were enjoined not to fall in the wilderness; let us accept the full weight of the word of the cross.<a name=5:15></a> It is no use if we are not taking in the word of the cross: we should feel the solemnity of the fact that we are near those who regard it as foolishness.<a name=5:16></a> The Corinthians did not behave themselves in relation to the Lord's supper.<a name=5:17></a> Let there be the acceptance of the word of the cross in its full bearing, the kind of death by which He died.<a name=5:18></a> There is a danger of toleration and of not accepting the word fully.<a name=5:19></a> Crucified with Christ is the acceptance of the scandal of that death; death by the sword would have been honourable but it was the death of the cross that was a scandal.<a name=5:20></a>

		<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>deals with this matter as regards our old man; baptism is the sign which leads up to it: "Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with him, that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin".<a name=5:21></a> Circumcision is the putting off of the body of the flesh, but here it is

		THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF CHRIST AS SEEN IN DAVID

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=13:1></a> I had in mind to call attention to the attractiveness of David, figurative of Christ, throughout the tribes, and to point out the three positions in which he is seen: how certain came to him by name in the first two positions, that is Ziklag and the stronghold in the wilderness, and then in Hebron how they came to him tribally.<a name=13:2></a> I thought that the chapter furnishes us with a remarkable type of Christ as the centre of gathering and the object of affection amongst the saints, and it brings out the varied qualities of the saints, first in certain of the tribes, Benjamin and Gad and Judah, and then in all the tribes.<a name=13:3></a> From verse 23 to the end, that is a universal interest, only two priests are mentioned specifically; in the section treating of Hebron the tribes are all mentioned, but only two men are specifically mentioned, that is, Jehoiada, who is called, as it says, the prince of Aaron, and Zadok, a valiant young man.<a name=13:4></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=13:8></a> I think the first, Ziklag, is the Roman position, denoting the recovery of all that had been lost.<a name=13:9></a> The second position is in the wilderness, as you will observe, in the stronghold; verse 8 says the Gadites separated themselves to David in the stronghold in the wilderness; I would venture to suggest that the position there is Corinthian, the fellowship.<a name=13:10></a> And verse 23, that is Hebron, would be Colossians -- the Christ of Colossians; and He is the centre in these three presentations of Him; He is the object of interest and attraction, a centre of gathering, as viewed in these three positions.<a name=13:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=14:13></a> That is evident, I think.<a name=14:14></a> In the case of Judah we have personal distinction, that is, each believer normally distinguishes himself in these positions.<a name=14:15></a> They are positions that require military exploits, and we are all tested as to whether we are distinguished by such; great military ability is stressed up to verse 22.<a name=14:16></a>

		J.T.<a name=15:20></a> I think so.<a name=15:21></a> Romans sets us free from ourselves; we learn how, as it says, "with the mind I myself serve the law of God" so that it is a question of God henceforth; the Holy Spirit comes in to support us in that, and the chapters from 8 to 12 are to show how the believer overcomes himself; that is, he rules over himself by the Spirit.<a name=15:22></a> It says: "If Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:10">Romans  8:10</a>), so that the body ceases to be a vehicle of sin and there is room for the Spirit to bring in righteousness, and it works out in our giving place to good, so that good predominates -- to overcome the evil with good.<a name=15:23></a> And the epistle stresses too that love is the whole law.<a name=15:24></a> The heart is garrisoned at the outset by the love of

		J.T.<a name=21:4></a> You mean they did not let the matter rest.<a name=21:5></a> They placed the information where it could be used to the best advantage.<a name=21:6></a> Things are often allowed to drift along; no one does anything, and the enemy has the advantage.<a name=21:7></a>

		J.T.<a name=21:10></a> Quite so.<a name=21:11></a> I think going over the Jordan means that one accepts death; death enters into this side of the matter.<a name=21:12></a> Going over the Jordan is a Colossian thought; the epistles are linked up that way.<a name=21:13></a> The truth of going over the Jordan implies that one accepts death in view of the need, not for the sake of an exploit.<a name=21:14></a> One of the most sorrowful features of the long war between the house of Saul and the house of David is this matter of exploits of the strong men, a number from each side showing what they could do -- their exploits.<a name=21:15></a> There is nothing for God in that at all.<a name=21:16></a> The point is not to be distinguished for exploits just because you wish to be distinguished; all the mighty men of David did things for a purpose, and usually you find that in the exploit the Lord worked a great deliverance.<a name=21:17></a> That is what you have in mind.<a name=21:18></a> The conflict is His, He is the Captain of Jehovah's host.<a name=21:19></a>

		These scriptures speak of odour, and the object of this meeting is to seek to show how the thought applies now.<a name=30:1></a> I have selected the scripture from the New Testament because it brings the subject before us in one person and in the direct and literal meaning to be inferred; that is, we see a servant moving about in this wicked world which is full of all that is of ill-savour that the place is capable of.<a name=30:2></a> The Western world, led by the Romans associated with the Greeks, developed sin as it had not been developed perhaps hitherto, having the culture which man is capable of and the means too, the wealth of the world, so sin has become developed.<a name=30:3></a> I suppose the Lord came into the world as sin had reached its height in that sense, its development.<a name=30:4></a> Then since the introduction of christianity the principle has gone on and the world has kept pace, so that sin has reached a peculiar height in our time with all its accompanying nauseous obnoxious odours.<a name=30:5></a> And this servant of the Lord can speak in these remarkable verses of what he was in the sense of an odour to God.<a name=30:6></a> But he dwells first on the effect on man of the knowledge that he proclaimed in ministry; he stresses the odour of that, a heavenly fragrance brought in, as he says, "in every place".<a name=30:7></a> God does not only appeal to man's intelligence, to his mind, but to his sense of smell, as if He would include all the senses in His testimony.<a name=30:8></a> There are five, as we know, and they are all in mind in the testimony, hearing and seeing and feeling and tasting and smelling, God in His grace and in the richness of this dispensation appealing to men in their entire being in His testimony.<a name=30:9></a> So the apostle can speak of

		I hope to come back to that remarkable passage, but I want to show how this thought of odour runs through the Scriptures, hoping that each one will see that it fits him; and first to show how, in Noah, we have the principle of effulgence in this sense.<a name=31:4></a> Noah's father had spoken prophetically about him, and I suppose prophecies going before apply to every one who is especially used of the Lord.<a name=31:5></a> There is the forecast in a prophetic way, and then the committal of the saints to each one, "imposition of the hands of the elderhood" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#4:14">1 Timothy  4:14</a>), and what the elderhood would discern is what it would prophesy; there must be perfect agreement with the prophetic announcement as to a man and the practical working out in the person in mind in his service.<a name=31:6></a> This was seen perfectly, I need not say, in the Lord Jesus, concerning whom there had been great prophetic announcements beforehand, and not the least were those uttered by Simeon as he took Him in his arms, yet a Babe, but what wonderful potentialities in that Babe!<a name=31:7></a> What effulgence in glory and odour to God was to shine out in His service!<a name=31:8></a> How the saints from the outset have committed themselves to Jesus from the standpoint of service!<a name=31:9></a> We have committed our souls to Him; we have committed ourselves to Him in view of eternity, but there is committal to Him from the standpoint of service, and this is

		represented in the house of Simon the leper.<a name=32:1></a> It is a remarkable thing, but it is there the Lord is anointed on the head by a woman whose name is not given.<a name=32:2></a> We may infer who she was, but the point is that she committed herself to Him discerning the ability to serve; turning away from the whole hierarchy in Jerusalem, which claimed so much, she committed herself to <i>Him</i>.<a name=32:3></a> She anointed Him on the head and the Lord said, "Wheresoever these glad tidings may be preached in the whole world, that also which this woman has done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her", meaning that she was an odour in that she would accompany the glad tidings of the Christ; wherever it was preached she must be mentioned.<a name=32:4></a> He says, "What <i>she</i> could she has done" -- that is, she was not assuming to be able to serve, yet she did what she could, and that was that she committed herself to Him who could serve and serve perfectly in every respect.<a name=32:5></a> It is in the apprehension of that that I think you will follow what is about to be said as to odour.<a name=32:6></a>

		So as regards Noah, his father carefully intimated his ministry; he said, He is to be a comfort to us on account of the ground which the Lord has cursed.<a name=32:7></a> There would be no special fragrance in the ground as cursed of God, but Noah would change that, and hence the prophecy going before in due course was fulfilled and manifested.<a name=32:8></a> It came out in the way of unselfishness: he built an altar and took of every clean beast and every clean fowl and offered burnt offerings, and it says, "Jehovah smelled the sweet odour", a savour of rest, that is a savour of Noah, for that is what his name meant, it was what had been announced; that was the name given to him, it was the shining out of glory in him.<a name=32:9></a> And so the savour of Paul too, and of every servant who serves according to God; there was a savour of Paul, he was a savour of Christ -- it was that kind -- in those

		I pass on to chapter 27 so that we may see how a young christian comes under God with a view to all this.<a name=34:9></a> God has ordered things so that Isaac is now ready to bless -- not that he knew Jacob, but he discerned he had the smell of blessing.<a name=34:10></a> It was not a new thing with Jacob: he had a history, God had been with him before, before he was born he was a subject of the work of God in this sense.<a name=34:11></a> It is a remarkable thing that we have such suggestions in Scripture; how far back God goes -- to the source of our being, so that He begins His work and secures us for Himself.<a name=34:12></a> "The elder", it says, "shall serve the

		But then with Isaac it was just one kind of odour, and I am going to speak a little about the great variety of odours in the compound that God has in His assembly.<a name=35:19></a> You can understand, dear brethren, that every such one, every one like Jacob whom God has blessed, has an odour of his own, so to speak.<a name=35:20></a> In Genesis we get isolated cases, but we get the aggregate in Exodus, the collective thought, the gathering up of all that there is in unity, so that we

		Now I come back just for a moment to the apostle to bring out the thought in regard of those of us who are more specifically privileged to serve the Lord and to serve His people, first as to the character of knowledge, whether it is free from all that is merely intellectual, whether it is fresh, whether it is free from stain, whether it is in the freshness and energy of the Spirit of God and so emitting a fragrance in every place, for that is the idea.<a name=40:2></a> The idea of ministry is that ministers go from place to place; the Lord sent the seventy two by two before Him "into every city and place where he Himself was about to come" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10:1">Luke  10:1</a>).<a name=40:3></a> As He came to the town, there would be that fragrance, the freshness and knowledge they had from heaven to convey to men.<a name=40:4></a> And then, secondly, as has been said, how the apostle was himself fragrant, no doubt carrying on the thought of the knowledge, but he himself was fragrant, that is in keeping with the knowledge that he has spread abroad -- I suppose the allusion is to the triumphal entry accorded to returning victors in the Roman era -- they were honoured in this way.<a name=40:5></a> But how great is the thought of God leading us in triumph, as the apostle said -- <i>God</i> doing it.<a name=40:6></a> Whatever the opposition, all is well, even if there were no converts, even if there were dire opposition -- always led in triumph by God, and the savour of divine knowledge shed abroad, so that there was in truth a triumphal return from every service, whether it was a successful service, or whether it seemed to result in very little.<a name=40:7></a> There was a savour of life unto life, and of death

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That was all I had to say, dear brethren; I suppose it can be easily followed.<a name=41:4></a> One can only make a few suggestions; the gain would follow in looking into these things and seeing how they apply, whether I can have part in this holy fragrance for God that is to continue till the end.<a name=41:5></a> There is no doubt that the Lord is aiming at perfecting us so that we shall have this testimony before our translation that we please God.<a name=41:6></a>

		J.T.<a name=43:9></a> That is the way it stands here.<a name=43:10></a> Habakkuk's book refers to discipline; he had come to recognise this discipline and the last chapter is said to be upon Shigionoth, the musical instruments, whatever it may mean, but it ends on Neginoth, stringed instruments, as if there is a steady progress.<a name=43:11></a> The first part doubtless alludes to what is oppressive and the heart is varied in its expressions, as it is with most of us; as we are in the making our notes are varied, perhaps doleful, but we gradually merge to a higher plane where there is complete deliverance and we breathe another atmosphere.<a name=43:12></a> Then, whatever God may allow in His discipline and government, we are unmoved.<a name=43:13></a> He says, "I will rejoice in Jehovah, I will joy in the God of my salvation.<a name=43:14></a> Jehovah, the Lord, is my strength" -- a great point to reach, and it is where we are qualified to enter on assembly service when we are thus delivered.<a name=43:15></a>

		J.T.<a name=46:8></a> Quite so.<a name=46:9></a> He tells us all; no doubt the germ of it was while he was in the fish's belly, but it is a production afterwards, and therefore it was a fixed contribution.<a name=46:10></a> That is, I suppose, how our hymnbook was built up, but these prophetic productions are of the same order and remind us that the service of God is largely a question of singing; that is, the outcome of feelings in appointed channels in a living way.<a name=46:11></a>

		J.T.<a name=81:9></a> The teaching of the cross is the most drastic of the truths we have been dealing with; because it is God operating and turning the crucifixion of Christ round and making it apply to man in his wicked condition.<a name=81:10></a> Christ crucified is the expression of God's judgment on man, "Cursed is every one hanged upon a tree" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3:13">Galatians  3:13</a>).<a name=81:11></a> Every one of us deserves the curse, but God makes it fall on Him who did not deserve it.<a name=81:12></a> Those that crucified Him deserved it, but God's judgment of them and of all of us was expressed there.<a name=81:13></a> It is a most drastic thought, because it involves the cross, and the word of it here (notice that the footnote says 'the word, <i>logos</i>, which speaks of the cross' ) is to bring out the way the thing is to be spoken of; it is "to them that perish foolishness, but to us that are saved it is God's power".<a name=81:14></a> It refers to persons who are characteristically saved, or being saved.<a name=81:15></a> If I accept the word of God, the word of righteousness and the word of reconciliation I shall accept the cross.<a name=81:16></a> It is a most drastic thing; the truth of the cross is the power of God to persons who are being saved, "are saved" is not final, but a

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have selected these verses to make some remarks as to normal christian progress.<a name=85:1></a> Progression spiritually is to mark believers.<a name=85:2></a> It is not that there is progression in christianity; the christianity itself into which we have come is what is from the beginning.<a name=85:3></a> What we come into is what is from the beginning, and it was a completed thought before we came into it, so that there is no development in the thing itself.<a name=85:4></a> It was a perfected idea set up here into which men were to come, and in which they were to grow.<a name=85:5></a> Progression therefore applies to the believer as coming into it, and that goes on whilst he is in the body, in the present condition.<a name=85:6></a> No one can say that he has already reached the fulness of it.<a name=85:7></a> He who perhaps reached it more than any spoke in this way, that he did not account himself to have "already obtained" or to be "already perfected", but he pursued "looking towards the goal, for the prize of the calling on high of God in Christ Jesus" (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3:14">Philippians  3:14</a>).<a name=85:8></a> The road therefore on which the believer enters is in that direction and leads to the calling on high in Christ Jesus.<a name=85:9></a> The believer progresses in that way and it is normal that he should.<a name=85:10></a> Anything else is abnormal.<a name=85:11></a> Normally that is the divine thought for us; and so I have selected these scriptures, one in the Psalms pointing to the strength, going "from strength to strength"; and that in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#3">2 Corinthians  3</a>, "glory to glory", without giving any limit in either case.<a name=85:12></a> I know full well that with everyone here, even with the apostle himself when here, at the outset it is not just so.<a name=85:13></a> Our experiences generally are irregular or undulating, as I may call them; that is, up and down, more down than up, indeed!<a name=85:14></a> The types assumed that; although it says that there was not one weak amongst Israel as they came out of Egypt,

		for the process of coming out of Egypt is in itself strengthening.<a name=86:1></a> One emerging according to the spiritual, of course, is strong, as we get in the Acts and in the gospels: how persons coming under the power of God and affected by it were strong.<a name=86:2></a> The ankle bones of a lame man were made strong, so that he walked and leaped and praised God.<a name=86:3></a> Walking is one strength and leaping is another and praising God is another; there is definite progress at the very start and it is to continue, so that the believer's part in progress is certainly very attractive.<a name=86:4></a> As Scripture presents it, it is very attractive.<a name=86:5></a> No one should be at all ashamed of it in presenting it to men, women and children.<a name=86:6></a> It is a glorious matter.<a name=86:7></a> But, as I said, the young believer as a rule has ups and downs, and more downs than ups; but in all that, he is learning and brought into, as the types show, a remarkable system of things, a system that takes account of that very fact, for in the type which suggests the reception of the Spirit, or at least the gift of the Spirit from the divine side, in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#17">Exodus  17</a>, the battle of Rephidim was an up and down matter, and it alludes to the daily experience of the young believer.<a name=86:8></a> God graciously furnishes us with that at the outset in the types so that no young christian should become weary and fall out, but go on.<a name=86:9></a> Hence as Moses' hands were heavy and were let down, Amalek prevailed, as if Israel could not help it.<a name=86:10></a> It was a question of Moses' support, and intercession, that is, that kind of thing.<a name=86:11></a> It is not that Christ's hands become weak at all; it is a question of the system into which we are brought as set up here in responsibility.<a name=86:12></a> Although weakness is there, as we go on, as the exigencies arise they are met; so that as Moses' hands grew heavy he was put on a stone and he sat thereon and his hands were upheld by Aaron and Hur, and Amalek was defeated.<a name=86:13></a> It is in that battle that young believers come to see that they can really gain a victory, and it is a

		great stimulant when you gain one victory; you gain another.<a name=87:1></a> You go from strength to strength; you go from that strength to the next necessary strength.<a name=87:2></a> But, as I said, it is undulating until the Spirit is received definitely; for whilst at the outset we talk about the Spirit, that we have the Spirit as believers, we have not learned how incorrigible the flesh is, and it takes a long time to come to that.<a name=87:3></a> It took Israel forty years.<a name=87:4></a> They learned the lesson of the brazen serpent and the springing well.<a name=87:5></a> That is a matter of digging under the direction of the lawgiver, for the real difficulty is that we do not recognise the lawgiver; that is, we allow our will.<a name=87:6></a> He is the best friend we have.<a name=87:7></a> The digging is at the direction of the lawgiver, and then the complete result is the springing well.<a name=87:8></a> They recognise it and sing unto it.<a name=87:9></a> It is not indeed left out of the service of God, for they sang there.<a name=87:10></a> They sang in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15">Exodus  15</a>, but they sang at the springing well.<a name=87:11></a> That is, they go from strength to strength, from one point to another, until they reach Pisgah where the whole position is in view; as if you would say, 'What a God He has been to me as I look back on my history; Canaan is now my prospect, the calling on high of God in Christ Jesus'.<a name=87:12></a>

		Well now, having made these remarks, I come to the first of John because this verse, referring to the setting of it (the preceding verses including this) speaks of the system inaugurated by the incarnation of Christ.<a name=87:13></a> I do not say immediately by His birth, but as John presents it, "The Word became flesh, and dwelt among us".<a name=87:14></a> It is not a babe he is speaking of; it includes the babyhood of Christ, speaking reverently; but it is Christ, the Word become flesh, viewed in that way and dwelling among us.<a name=87:15></a> How attractive the thing is, dwelling among us, one like Jesus dwelling among us!<a name=87:16></a> Were one living in Capernaum in those days he might see the Lord; He lived there day in and day out.<a name=87:17></a> What grace shone!<a name=87:18></a> <a name=88>[Page 88]</a>

		"The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:35">John  3:35</a>).<a name=123:1></a> Now in chapter 7 of John, it says "the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified".<a name=123:2></a> The Spirit is in mind, but it is the Spirit of Christ glorified that is in mind; He was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified.<a name=123:3></a> The great thought of glory enters into the gift of the Spirit, for indeed He is said to be the Spirit of glory, and not only that but it rests upon believers in certain circumstances so that he is the means here of effectuating glory in believers.<a name=123:4></a> John has a great deal to say about the word 'glory', and stresses much the "glory as of an only-begotten with a father", as suggestive of what he has in mind, "a glory as of an only-begotten with a father, full of grace and truth" (chapter 1:14), meaning that the bearing of it is towards the believer, and that his particular need in this world is in mind.<a name=123:5></a> It is all a question of effectuating the thought of God in the scene of need, so that the One that is seen is glorious, that is everything that is of account has glory, the "glory as of an only-begotten with a father" is "full of grace and truth", full of it.<a name=123:6></a> These are initial thoughts in the divine economy in John's gospel; love is the basis, but displayed in grace and truth as meeting need so as to bring about the divine thoughts.<a name=123:7></a> Grace first, then truth, and then the Son is loved and all things are given into His hand, and then an example in chapter 4 of how the thing works.<a name=123:8></a> He goes His way, as is said, "full of grace and truth", all that transpires illustrating what it means, so that at the end of <a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>we have the statement, "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand", and then immediately the wonderful story in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>already alluded to, among many other remarkable things.<a name=123:9></a> That story is intended to exemplify the economy: what it really means is the working out that the Lord is full of grace and truth; it is exemplified at the well, "full of grace and

		Well now, that brings me to another point, that divine thoughts and purposes are the background of what I am saying, and how God reaches the thought of glory in them so that what I have said about <a href="../bible/John.htm#7">John  7</a>leads me to speak about the Spirit in Romans, how He comes in in Romans as shedding abroad the love of God in our hearts.<a name=125:7></a> The position is carefully selected by the Holy Spirit, it is "in our hearts"; the love of God is shed abroad there by the Holy Spirit.<a name=125:8></a> Now that, I believe, may be fitted in in Luke, the well-known chapter 15.<a name=125:9></a> The prodigal has reached the end there, and I can see as reading it from time to time that divine thoughts must underlie all; that is, the prior thoughts of God; He is always working from His own thoughts.<a name=125:10></a> What happened in the history of humanity enables the Lord to work out what He does in the parable, but He is thinking of divine thoughts, that is, what is lost is <i>valuable</i>.<a name=125:11></a> The sheep is lost -- it is valuable; the piece of money is lost -- it is valuable; the son is lost -- he is valuable.<a name=125:12></a> It is the divine thought of things, and the more we get back to that, dear brethren, the more assuredly it will be in our souls; as it is said in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#9:23">Romans  9:23</a>, "vessels of mercy, which he had before prepared for glory, us".<a name=125:13></a> Now notice that, "Before prepared for glory"; they were in the mind of God.<a name=125:14></a> There is not

		These scriptures have been read because they bring to our attention energy in relation to the things of God, so that is what will engage us, by the Lord's help, during this service, and I would add, thoroughness in the energy.<a name=136:1></a> The world has made rapid strides of recent years in the way of energy, and increased education has promoted the acquirement of thoroughness.<a name=136:2></a> The christian is set in these circumstances, among many others, and in them God would lay it upon him to encounter them in the way of energy in regard of His world, and thoroughness also, that is to say, going the full length in regard to any and every feature of the truth and any line divinely indicated, for half measures are well nigh equal to no measures at all.<a name=136:3></a> Not that heaven is not ready to accredit us with any interest or any movement at all, for even in a man like Ahab, God says, "Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me?<a name=136:4></a>" (<a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#21:29">1 Kings  21:29</a>).<a name=136:5></a> There is not a movement of heart or mind or affection in regard of God or His things or His people that is not noted in heaven.<a name=136:6></a> But, at the same time, our salvation, practically, depends on going all the way, especially now that we are drawing near to the end of this wonderful period called "the acceptable year of the Lord" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4:19">Luke  4:19</a>).<a name=136:7></a> The time of the end is manifestly near and the Spirit of God would be urgent, pressing upon us to go on to perfection, one saying, "If he draw back, my soul does not take pleasure in him", but remarking further, "But <i>we</i> are not drawers back to perdition, but of faith to saving the soul" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:38">Hebrews  10:38</a>,39).<a name=136:8></a>

		John: from that time the glad tidings of the kingdom of God are announced, and everyone forces his way into it".<a name=137:1></a> The law and the prophets represented a great period, yet we have to remember that the law made nothing perfect; still there was a great period of testimony from Moses till Malachi, and indeed up to John the baptist.<a name=137:2></a> No lapse is supposed, no interval of inactivity of any kind by God, the preaching of the kingdom was from the days of John the baptist; and I wish to speak of that first, that the preaching of it brought out energy, not the want of energy that is often seen in believers listening to ministry, perhaps to the gospel, and returning home forgetting what they heard.<a name=137:3></a> The preaching brought out energy, and that is what is needed in all these matters, but particularly now in regard to the kingdom of God.<a name=137:4></a> Daniel had already spoken of the kingdom of God, indeed it had been intimated throughout in the law and the prophets, but I speak of Daniel so as to enlist the sympathy and interest, and to call out the energy of young people, first of all.<a name=137:5></a> Daniel in his interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar's dream, arrived at the stone cut out without hands, and he says, "In the days of these kings" (<a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#2:44">Daniel  2:44</a>), that is, the four great monarchies that we often speak of and which are now commanding the attention peculiarly of those who have eyes to see.<a name=137:6></a> The Lord Himself spoke of them, calling the period the times of the nations, or gentiles, and Daniel tells Nebuchadnezzar that in those days, in the days of those kings, the God of the heavens shall set up a kingdom.<a name=137:7></a> Now I wish the young people here particularly to pay attention to what is being said, for young people are apt to droop, in having to do with the world as it is in its energy in this great iron age, as the scripture regards it; not all iron, it is partly clay, hard and fragile at the same time, but it is very imposing, and young people are at times overwhelmed as they see the marvellous

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=164:4></a> Well, if you look through Exodus you will find that, after the glory shines in Moses in chapter 34, and the people are afraid of him, he influenced them, and it turned them round toward him: "<i>We</i> all, looking on the glory of the Lord, with unveiled face, are transformed" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#3:18">2 Corinthians  3:18</a>), it is a sort of allusion to that, meaning that a young christian is not afraid of Christ and the glory; it is attractive.<a name=164:5></a> Then in chapter 35 we have the sabbath; we must learn to lie fallow and absorb heavenly thoughts.<a name=164:6></a> It is not only your mind now, but your whole body is subservient and restful, so that you have the thoughts of God.<a name=164:7></a> Then Moses tells them what he needs and they depart from him, as much as to say, 'We will do it for ourselves; we are trustworthy now', and they come back with all that is needed, men and women, and then the work begins, and it is all brought to Moses, and then it is anointed and set up, and the glory appears.<a name=164:8></a> It all works out from the love of the bondman, the bondman spirit.<a name=164:9></a>

		J.T.<a name=165:5></a> Yes, the point is you have control of the mind, and that is wherein lies the capability of change.<a name=165:6></a> "I became in the Spirit", John says; so that we change over to be alongside of Christ with His mind, with His feelings and sensibilities.<a name=165:7></a> That is really what is in mind in the scripture, this process of change, so that we are able to stand up alongside the Lord, as it were, having His mind and seeing what He is going on with; we are with Him; He knows He has us and we know what to do.<a name=165:8></a> We do not give out unsuitable hymns and we do not say unsuitable things, things that would be right in other settings, but are not right in these settings.<a name=165:9></a> Priests know what to do; so the exhortation, "Have your mind on the things that are above" is just to suggest that you have power to do that.<a name=165:10></a>

		J.T.<a name=170:9></a> Verse 26 fits in, I believe, with our times.<a name=170:10></a> Verses 15 to 20 present the Spirit in relation to normal conditions at the outset from Pentecost on, that is, whilst conditions remained normal; and then the Lord brings up the thought of an individual loving Him, that is, one who had His commandments and kept them.<a name=170:11></a> The commandments are supposed to have been there; any individual who had them and kept them showed his love.<a name=170:12></a> From that verse to the end of verse 24 there is, I think, the idea of broken days, when the saints should be tested by the commandments, keeping the commandments and keeping the word of Christ, and, in view of that, the idea of things being brought to our remembrance, for much had been beclouded; if we look at it from the standpoint of the history of the assembly, much had been obscured and lost, and the Spirit would bring all out into clarity in the minds of the saints; and, not only that, but as the Lord says, "<i>He</i> shall teach you all things, and will bring to your remembrance all the things which I have said to you".<a name=170:13></a> "<i>He</i> shall teach" being emphatic would mean that others failed in that; the teaching in christendom had failed in that, so that the thought of His teaching and bringing to our remembrance is brought in in verse 26 as a provision for these times.<a name=170:14></a>

		of the bride, the assembly, viewed in that way.<a name=178:1></a> Friendship and confidence necessarily precede the wifely relationship of the saints to Christ, and I believe that the Lord has all that in mind when He says, "But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who goes forth from with the Father, <i>he</i> shall bear witness concerning me".<a name=178:2></a> I think the Lord has in mind in sending the Spirit that the saints should become conversant with the Father's thoughts about Him.<a name=178:3></a> The Spirit is with the Father and He goes forth; He is sent by the Son, but still He goes forth Himself, as from with the Father, carrying all that the Father thought about the Son, as Abraham's servant would carry to Rebecca all that Abraham thought about Isaac, and how concerned he was as to the one to be companion for Isaac!<a name=178:4></a> The Spirit, as sent by Christ in that sense, goes forth from with the Father, He is thoroughly conversant with the Father's thoughts, and He will be occupied now in testifying to Christ as known up there, not as known down here.<a name=178:5></a> For the point in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24">Genesis  24</a>is Isaac up there; Isaac is in the land, he did not go down to Beer-sheba with the young men.<a name=178:6></a> So I think the Father, having this in mind, sent the Spirit to testify to Him, and it would include Paul's ministry.<a name=178:7></a>

		J.T.<a name=184:1></a> What is to be noted here is that the Lord does not stress that the Spirit should use the saints.<a name=184:2></a> We know that in coming here the Spirit did use the saints, He works in a vessel, but the Lord is not stressing that here, but that He was with the Father and He proceeded forth from with the Father, and that the Son sent Him, and that He should testify; how He should do it is not the point.<a name=184:3></a> The twelve are also in addition to that.<a name=184:4></a> Chapter 16 is the battlefield, and the Lord shows how the Comforter exposes the world.<a name=184:5></a> It is an immense thing in conflict that the enemy's position is exposed; you know just where he is; that is, the Spirit "will bring demonstration to the world, of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment".<a name=184:6></a> This is a side we cannot ignore, it is most essential we should understand how the Comforter is looking after us in this public conflict.<a name=184:7></a> What comes out in these conflicts we have in a little way now to go through, is that the Lord, by the Spirit, exposes where the enemy is; you see just what he is aiming at.<a name=184:8></a>

		J.T.<a name=189:1></a> The trend of the meeting is to enable us to look together at the spiritual quality marking the end of the great dispensations of God, the first beginning at <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>, and extending to <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#6">Genesis  6</a>, and then the second extending to the end of the book, inclusive of all the dealings of God from the entrance into Egypt by Jacob and his family until Christ really, but as seen ended in Malachi, and then the present dispensation ending in the verses read in Revelation.<a name=189:2></a> These scriptures will be seen, I believe, as we look at them, to represent spiritual quality or qualities, which, although seen in but a few, were there as witness to the divine workmanship, a subject bearing particularly on ourselves now as drawing near to the end, so that the quality indicated in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22">Revelation  22</a>should appear more definitely.<a name=189:3></a> The Lord, as He announces Himself as "the root and offspring of David, the bright and morning star" is recognised; the Spirit and the bride join in asking Him to come.<a name=189:4></a> Noah would represent the first dispensation, and Jacob the second, and those in Malachi the third, and the Spirit and the bride the supreme thought; nothing can exceed, in the sense of spiritual stature, what we get in them.<a name=189:5></a>

		J.T.<a name=190:6></a> That is what I thought.<a name=190:7></a> He is prophetically spoken of as born by his father, who called his name Noah, saying, "This one shall comfort us concerning our work and concerning the toil of our hands, because of the ground which Jehovah has cursed".<a name=190:8></a> We can see, I think, that the Lord had wrought in him with a great end in view and that it was reached; it represents the work of God at that time.<a name=190:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=192:12></a> I think it is important to keep the cumulative side in mind because it is the work of God.<a name=192:13></a> Peter undoubtedly touches particularly on Noah, because Peter deals with the government of God.<a name=192:14></a> He addresses his first letter to those of the dispersion, meaning that they were dispersed in the government of God.<a name=192:15></a> But the government of God did not interfere with the work of God, but rather accentuated it; it was the very thing that helped externally to develop in them the truth of christianity.<a name=192:16></a> So it is said of Noah, that he was one of eight, and saved; Peter says "into which few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#3:20">1 Peter  3:20</a>), they are the few of privilege.<a name=192:17></a> The government of God has a sifting character to it, and those that subsist are the privileged ones.<a name=192:18></a> So Peter says, "The time of having the judgment begin from the house of God is come", but then the house of God is us in his mind, that is real

		I have in mind to speak about divine selection, and, as a secondary application of the thought, to speak of it in relation to service or testimony here; but the primary thought is in relation to the divine counsels.<a name=207:1></a> The fact that selection or choice is related to these counsels implies that there were some who were not selected; before the selected ones or the unselected ones had any being, they were all before God.<a name=207:2></a> The idea of selection or choice necessarily implies that all were not included in the choice; some were excluded.<a name=207:3></a> And so we have the idea of foreknowledge in God, meaning that He, as looking down the whole course of time, saw all, even in regard to life; He foresaw a time when it would be needed and the need felt, and promised it.<a name=207:4></a> In connection with this side of the truth, we have the idea of choice connected with our circumstances here, that is, that all things work together for good to those who are the called according to God's purpose, and then the thought of foreknowledge, and that this led the way for what is particularly in the divine heart, that is sonship.<a name=207:5></a> "Whom he has foreknown", we are told, "he has also predestinated to be conformed to the image of his Son, so that he should be the firstborn among many brethren" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:29">Romans  8:29</a>).<a name=207:6></a> That is perhaps the most choice bit that we can get, as bringing in what is in the divine heart, foreknowledge, predestination, and conformation to the image of God's Son that He might be the firstborn among many brethren.<a name=207:7></a> That is the great divine thought, the thought of God's heart seen in Christ and in those that are like Him, conformed to His image.<a name=207:8></a> That is, as I said, the most choice selection of words that you can get as bringing

		The quails in chapter 16 are connected with the sacrificial and public side of the death of Christ in an initial and elementary character.<a name=233:1></a> These, unlike the manna, are not continued, but the manna presents what Christ was here as coming in from heaven.<a name=233:2></a> The measure, according to verse 18, is proportionate to the capacity of the gatherer.<a name=233:3></a> We cannot appropriate more of Christ than we have capacity for.<a name=233:4></a> This is all leading to the spiritual thought of the Sabbath, illustrating the state of mind and soul of one who is restful before God, the land lying, so to speak, in a fallow state, ready to be acted upon by the sun and rain.<a name=233:5></a> These Sabbath conditions would stand connected with the contemplation of the Lord in the gospels, while the exercises in the epistles would pertain more to the side of spiritual diligence in divine things, the other active days of the week illustrating rather the diligence connected with the working out of the truth in the epistles.<a name=233:6></a>

		In regard to the position of Moses, Aaron and Hur in verse 10, it is suggested that one could liken this to the organism of a man's body, functioning co-relatively.<a name=234:8></a> It is not what is in heaven.<a name=234:9></a> It represents elements here in the Spirit for support in the conflict: the Lord's authority in Moses, intercession in Aaron and purity in Hur (who is also brought in without formal introduction as illustrating the work of God in its spontaneity in the soul).<a name=234:10></a>

		In chapter 18 we have a dispensational setting, but in addition, that which also has a moral bearing.<a name=235:4></a> Jethro's unexpected testimony rendered to Moses and calculated to strengthen his leadership on moral lines with Israel shows that all that he had been through as a sojourner in a foreign land had resulted in fruit for God, which was now to be available in relation to the great trust God had confided to him.<a name=235:5></a> So that earlier history with a servant of the Lord, of however little account it may appear at the time, plays its part in accrediting him later in the mission God has entrusted to him.<a name=235:6></a> Paul's own time in Arabia, alluded to in Galatians, supports this, as indeed too the history of many of the Old Testament servants of Jehovah.<a name=235:7></a>

		Then this great thought of rule diffused among Israel is all preparatory to the working out of the truth of the assembly in the wilderness, spiritual respect for authority being brought down to chiefs of tens, so that all might be handled in detail according to divine rule, and none might suffer through there being so many matters calling for discernment, rule, and judgment.<a name=235:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the allusion to Christ's death in verse 13 is touching, Israel being absolved as they were in the beginning of the Acts from wanton murder in regard of Christ.<a name=237:6></a> His having been "given up by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:23">Acts  2:23</a>) would link up with the thought of God having delivered the slain one into his hand.<a name=237:7></a> Hence the assembly is the place of refuge for repentant Israel, "to which he shall flee".<a name=237:8></a> But the slaying of Stephen was wanton and Israel was thus taken away from God's altar, "that he may die".<a name=237:9></a>

		In the incident of the goring ox, verses 28 and 29, the responsibility of assemblies was emphasised as seen in the owner, the power invested of the Lord there to restrain unbroken elements must be exercised.<a name=237:10></a> All the gathering is held responsible for damage done by such an one (end of verse 29).<a name=237:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=258:1></a> We were dwelling on John the baptist this morning, as illustrating a believer in whom Christ is in a sacrificial sense.<a name=258:2></a> We now have before us another phase of the subject, namely, Christ known as a prophet and then as "the Christ".<a name=258:3></a> The Lord told the woman He was the Christ, and she, speaking of Him to the men of the city says, "Is not he the Christ?<a name=258:4></a>".<a name=258:5></a> She had no doubt in her mind and it was effective in her testimony of Him.<a name=258:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is to be observed that John the baptist is carried forward to this section, to the end of chapter 3, so that he links on in his testimony with what we find in this chapter.<a name=258:7></a> The administrative thought is introduced.<a name=258:8></a> In the end of chapter 3 we get, "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand", so that the divine economy is really in mind in what is developed in this chapter, the economy into which divine Persons have come, the Father, the Son and the Spirit.<a name=258:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		John's testimony culminates in chapter 3, where he says, "He must increase, but I must decrease.<a name=258:10></a> He who comes from above is above all.<a name=258:11></a> He who has his origin in the earth is of the earth, and speaks as of the earth.<a name=258:12></a> He who comes out of heaven is above all, and what he has seen and has heard, this he testifies; and no one receives his testimony".<a name=258:13></a> And there is added, "He that has received his testimony has set to his seal that God is true; for he whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives not the Spirit by measure.<a name=258:14></a> The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand".<a name=258:15></a> In this passage the baptist's testimony merges in the evangelist's, and we have the full divine economy brought into view, and administration is because "the Father

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The woman of Samaria is the next example in our subject.<a name=259:4></a> She represents this to us as belonging to this dispensation.<a name=259:5></a> The fact that the Lord raises with her the question as to who He was is essential.<a name=259:6></a> John the baptist had known this; He did not have to raise the question with him.<a name=259:7></a> She did not know, so that He says, "If thou knewest the gift of God", (that enters into the administrative side, divine giving) "and who it is that says to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of him".<a name=259:8></a> So that she needed to learn everything, the gift of God, and who administered that gift, and anything that she would ask.<a name=259:9></a> So that she is set out as representative of this dispensation, in that way.<a name=259:10></a> The economy is so rich and great and wonderfully furnished to meet her need.<a name=259:11></a> So that we ask and receive what we need.<a name=259:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=259:23></a> I suppose that would be in her mind afterwards, that this glorious Person had at one time asked a drink of her.<a name=259:24></a> It links on with the idea of divine seeking, which we forget too much; that <i>we</i> should seek is obvious, but we forget that God seeks and asks.<a name=259:25></a>

		J.T.<a name=261:9></a> It is clearly so.<a name=261:10></a> John the baptist stresses the sacrificial side, which we have stated fully in chapter 3, and it is the outcome of love, "God so loved", and "Thus must the Son of man be lifted up".<a name=261:11></a> These are exigencies of God.<a name=261:12></a> God's love requires that this must happen.<a name=261:13></a> This is very solemn ground.<a name=261:14></a> Love is the leading thought in chapters 3 and 4.<a name=261:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=268:11></a> Quite so.<a name=268:12></a> As to the case at Ephesus, we read, "And finding certain disciples, he said to them, Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed?<a name=268:13></a> And they said to him, We did not even hear if the Holy Spirit was come.<a name=268:14></a> And he said, To what then were ye baptised?<a name=268:15></a> And they said, To the baptism of John.<a name=268:16></a> And Paul said, John indeed baptised with the baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe on him that was coming after him, that is, on Jesus.<a name=268:17></a> And when they heard that, they were baptised to the name of the Lord Jesus.<a name=268:18></a> And Paul having laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them".<a name=268:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now all this has to be taken into account if we are to be instructed in what we are now engaged with.<a name=268:20></a> God reserves His own right in regard to the gift of the Spirit.<a name=268:21></a> That is, we cannot say it is an automatic thing, "the Holy Spirit also, which God has given to those that obey him" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#5:32">Acts  5:32</a>).<a name=268:22></a> That is important.<a name=268:23></a> Here it is, "Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed?<a name=268:24></a>".<a name=268:25></a> It is a <i>subsequent</i> thing to faith; it is not automatic.<a name=268:26></a> So in the epistle to Ephesians which refers to this very scripture in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#19">Acts  19</a>, the apostle says, "In whom also, having believed,

		Peter in his confession here indicates that Christ was in him as the Holy One of God, which may be enlarged upon in view of it being the first day of the week, and may be enlarged upon as viewing Christ as the Priest, the Minister of the sanctuary, so that we may have a little in that connection in keeping with the first day of the week.<a name=277:6></a> Peter's exercises will find an answer in all of us as having part in the assembly.<a name=277:7></a> Assembly service is better known as Christ is known as Minister of the sanctuary.<a name=277:8></a>

		So the better rendering in verse 69 is (it is Peter who is speaking for the others), "We have believed and known that thou art the holy one of God"; "we have believed and known" would refer to past experience; "the holy one of God" would be an allusion to Aaron, said to be saint of Jehovah (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#106:16">Psalm  106:16</a>); he is spoken of in that relation, the word alluding to holiness, and he is spoken of in that way as envied of opposers, looking forward to Christ as envied then and now, for the allusion is to <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#16">Numbers  16</a>, where we have the rebellion of Korah, Dathan and Abiram, referring typically to the uprising in christendom in the history of the assembly, the hierarchical rivalry to Christ.<a name=277:9></a> So that our subject resolves itself at this time into an enquiry as to what is implied in

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=278:6></a> Well, that is the connection and it is very suggestive of our own times.<a name=278:7></a> The Lord had been unfolding Himself as the Holy One of God in priestly, spiritual power and substance, so that murmuring arose among His disciples, and the Lord says in verse 63, "It is the Spirit which quickens, the flesh profits nothing: the words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life".<a name=278:8></a> That is what marked the Lord.<a name=278:9></a> "Many therefore of his disciples having heard it said, This word is hard; who can hear it?<a name=278:10></a>".<a name=278:11></a> What He was saying was spirit and life, entirely spiritual, hence it says, "From that time many of his disciples went away back and walked no more with him".<a name=278:12></a> It meant a great falling away, not simply not following, but it was apostasy.<a name=278:13></a> They went away, walking no more with Him, and this brings out the confession of Peter as to his apprehension of Christ, and that of the others with him, that He was the Holy One of God, and that He would go on into the spiritual realm of His service, opening up the great service of God which is opened up in the epistle to the Hebrews later, where we are told, "We have such a one high priest who has sat down on the right hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens; minister of the holy places and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord has pitched, and not man" (chapter 8:1,2).<a name=278:14></a>

		Now in order to get the importance of the thought of the Minister of the sanctuary, which is in mind, and to really get an expansion of the thought, we should look a little at <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#28">Exodus  28</a>to see how the mediator enters into the Jewish service, and how the priesthood enters into assembly service.<a name=286:14></a> What comes out in Exodus is that what we have before us is a life-size picture of Moses from his birth, whereas we have nothing about Aaron until he is about to be taken up for service.<a name=286:15></a> He was probably over eighty years of age before he is mentioned, whereas Moses is the great primary thought, so that the early part of Exodus occupies us with him from his birth, and as to the representation of God in a man, it is Moses who was to be for God to Pharaoh, and Aaron was to be his prophet, not priest, but prophet.<a name=286:16></a> The priesthood of Aaron comes out formally in chapter 28, but the mediatorship of Moses comes out prominently much earlier, and that suggests the thought of the Lord's supper in the antitype, as marked by the authority of Christ, His official and moral authority,

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=287:11></a> That is what I was thinking.<a name=287:12></a> It is obvious that it is so, so that we are told in the early part of Exodus that after crossing the Red Sea, Moses led the people out of the camp to meet God (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#19:17">Exodus  19:17</a>).<a name=287:13></a> Now I would bring in this thought, hoping that the Lord will use it to help the brethren as to assembly service, leading on to the idea of the Minister of the sanctuary; that is, we come together in assembly.<a name=287:14></a> It is an inside place, a family expression.<a name=287:15></a> It is in relation to the Lord's supper that we leave our habitations on the first day of the week to meet together in assembly.<a name=287:16></a> It is a dominical matter.<a name=287:17></a> It is obvious that it is so.<a name=287:18></a> We need to be helped in our houses, as we move out of our houses into the street to go to the assembly, as we reach the place of meeting and sit down together; it is all a dominical matter, we have to do with the Lord, and as He has His place with us we are brought to God.<a name=287:19></a> He is Himself the object of service of worship, of praise, but then what He has in mind is to bring us to God.<a name=287:20></a> Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, but that only goes a certain distance, and it alludes to the authority of Christ over us, officially and morally.<a name=287:21></a>

		CHRIST IN THE BELIEVER (4)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/John.htm#9:1">John  9:1</a> - 41
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=297:1></a> Our subject this morning is Christ in the believer as Son of God, known as Son of God.<a name=297:2></a> So far we have considered John the baptist, as representative of a believer as apprehending Christ in him in a sacrificial sense, "the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world" Then the woman of Samaria, who represents a believer having Christ in him as "the Christ", One who does things for God; and yesterday we had Peter as one who had Christ in him as "the holy one of God", laying the basis for the service of God, Minister of the sanctuary.<a name=297:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we arrive at one who represents the believer as having Christ in him as Son of God.<a name=297:4></a> The Son of God, of course, is spoken of earlier than this.<a name=297:5></a> John the baptist spoke of Him, and He is much spoken of earlier, but in this chapter the Lord Himself is concerned that this particular believer should believe on Him as Son of God, as He says to him, "Thou, dost thou believe on the Son of God?<a name=297:6></a>".<a name=297:7></a> The word 'thou' is used twice in the better translation.<a name=297:8></a> The Lord would impress upon him, 'you yourself', so directing the man to himself.<a name=297:9></a> 'Thou' is the believer made to feel that the Lord is interested in him, "Thou, dost thou", and would have him believe in that sense on the Son of God.<a name=297:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is a very marvellous and important subject, and links us on with the apostle Paul's ministry, peculiarly, because it is he whose preaching first brings out the Son of God.<a name=297:11></a> Peter had known of it, of course, but Paul says, "God .<a name=297:12></a>.<a name=297:13></a>.<a name=297:14></a> was pleased to reveal his Son in me, that I may announce him as glad tidings among the nations" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#1:16">Galatians  1:16</a>).<a name=297:15></a> He stands out as representing this thought particularly.<a name=297:16></a>

		H.E.<a name=298:1></a>F.<a name=298:2></a> What would you say is involved in one taking this place as believing on Christ as the Son of God?<a name=298:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=298:4></a> A new order of things is opened up, by One who not only does things for God, but One who is in liberty Himself, in His own Person.<a name=298:5></a> A new order of things, sonship, involves Christ in this sense.<a name=298:6></a> It refers to His Person as here in manhood, inaugurating a new order of things.<a name=298:7></a> Being Son, He represents the magnitude of the gift of God for us, but He also operates bringing in a new order of things, so that what follows is the flock in the next chapter.<a name=298:8></a> He is an Object of faith known in the believer, bringing him into a new order of things.<a name=298:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.W.<a name=298:10></a>R.<a name=298:11></a> The faith of God is in Him.<a name=298:12></a> I was thinking of Abraham giving everything to Isaac, and the Father giving all things into the hand of the Son.<a name=298:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=298:14></a> That is the thought.<a name=298:15></a> "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:35">John  3:35</a>).<a name=298:16></a> That is, the Son acts of Himself, He has life in Himself, He sets free.<a name=298:17></a> Sonship sets you free: "Ye shall be really free".<a name=298:18></a> "The son abides for ever" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#8:35">John  8:35</a>); that is, in the house.<a name=298:19></a> All these statements bear on this chapter, because the next chapter is the opening up of the flock, the one flock is next, and chapter 11 is the family.<a name=298:20></a> So the Son of God in the believer involves complete deliverance for him in a new order of things, a new order of things in which love prevails.<a name=298:21></a> The Son presents that side.<a name=298:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.F.<a name=298:23></a> Does that represent complete deliverance from the world's system?<a name=298:24></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=299:4></a> That is an important part of our subject.<a name=299:5></a> Jesus passed on, it says.<a name=299:6></a> He is on the way to something; that is how the chapter opens.<a name=299:7></a> The end of the previous chapter says, "Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple", and then we have the words, "Going through the midst of them, and thus passed on".<a name=299:8></a> These words are beautiful in chapter 9, "And as he passed on, he saw a man blind from birth".<a name=299:9></a> That is, the Lord has left the temple; the Jews have refused Him, so that after this issue with the Jews He left the temple and hid Himself, but as He is passing on He has something in mind.<a name=299:10></a> This man comes in His way.<a name=299:11></a> Then it says, "And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he should be born blind?<a name=299:12></a>" It was Jesus who saw the man, as it says.<a name=299:13></a> Evidently the link is in His seeing the man, and the disciples are brought into it to enquire about him.<a name=299:14></a>

		R.H.<a name=299:15></a>K.<a name=299:16></a> Does this suggest the Sent One of God?<a name=299:17></a> "My Father worketh hitherto and I work".<a name=299:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=299:19></a> Quite so.<a name=299:20></a> He was sent into the world not to condemn it, but that it might be saved.<a name=299:21></a> The issue with the Jews in chapter 8 makes it an outstanding chapter in that sense, the Lord grappling with the evil that was in the Jews, which culminated in their taking up stones to cast at Him.<a name=299:22></a> So that there is nothing now but to leave.<a name=299:23></a> He went out of the temple and passed on, meaning that what chapter 8 involves is incidental.<a name=299:24></a> He passed on; He is not hindered by that opposition.<a name=299:25></a> He passes on and sees this man, and so He brings the disciples into the current of His thoughts.<a name=299:26></a> It is an important thing that we should get into the current of things in our minds.<a name=299:27></a> They enquire as to whether this man had sinned or his parents.<a name=299:28></a> Their minds were on the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=300:10></a> Yes, in taking up a man of this kind, who was blind from birth, we see what He can do with a man, a human being.<a name=300:11></a> He is not now creating the world; His works are seen there too, but now it is what He can do with a human being, "a man blind from birth".<a name=300:12></a>

		J.T.<a name=300:16></a> That doubtless helps us as to the works of God, and if any one of us is to be a testimony to the works of God, these features must come out.<a name=300:17></a> It is not simply that I am converted, and have received the Spirit, but what God has effected in me.<a name=300:18></a> So this great thought should therefore be in me, Christ in me as Son of God.<a name=300:19></a> This man is seen developing without any aid from anyone.<a name=300:20></a> The Lord opened his eyes but that was all.<a name=300:21></a> What ensues is a question of what developed in the man without any aid from anyone, even his father and mother did not aid him; "<i>He</i> is of age", they said, which is a good thought, it was well said, though they did not understand fully.<a name=300:22></a> The Spirit of God in recording it intends us to understand

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to proceed to the next point in Leviticus.<a name=339:3></a> It is a question here of what is in the house of the believer.<a name=339:4></a> First dispensationally at Pentecost, a period in which the Spirit of God came in, we have this "new oblation".<a name=339:5></a> It comes in after the waving of the sheaf of first-fruits before Jehovah.<a name=339:6></a> This sheaf was a meat-offering, and refers to what came out of the grave of Christ.<a name=339:7></a> What could touch our hearts more than the thought of the Father raising the Son by His own glory!<a name=339:8></a> The waving of the sheaf is the saints taking on Christ risen, and presenting Him before God.<a name=339:9></a> That is the first thought.<a name=339:10></a> These few verses speak of the new meat-offering.<a name=339:11></a> This time it is not the sheaf, nor fine flour, but loaves of bread, two of them, baken with leaven, an unusual thing for a meat-offering, but it is God encouraging us as to our houses, making full allowance for the inevitable fact that the leaven of sin is there, but the power is there to nullify sin in our houses.<a name=339:12></a> Romans teaches us how to nullify sin in ourselves and in our houses.<a name=339:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle Paul brings out the great thought of the believer's house.<a name=339:14></a> I have often thought that the stimulus that led to it was what he found in the house of Lydia at Philippi.<a name=339:15></a> She was a lone woman, whether an unmarried woman or a widow we do not know, but she had a house.<a name=339:16></a> She came in contact with Paul at Philippi by the river-side, and the Lord opened her heart.<a name=339:17></a> How God loves to do that, to open our hearts to attend to the things spoken by Paul, not only to be listening, but attending to them, and letting them have force, particularly in our households.<a name=339:18></a>

		This is an important matter with regard to these two loaves.<a name=340:5></a> It is always a question as to what is in your house, what is brought out of your house, and what is directly and livingly contributable to the service of God, namely, these two wave-loaves, loaves made of wheat or cereal of some kind, but baken with leaven, and yet presented to God as a new meat-offering.<a name=340:6></a> God is pleased to call it that.<a name=340:7></a>

		That is the second point I would stress, if our households are to be contributory to the assembly.<a name=341:3></a> So long as I am concerned only about myself, and not what I am contributing to the assembly, I shall lose all this side of the truth, and my loss is very great.<a name=341:4></a> Some ignore the household side of the truth, but their loss is incalculable.<a name=341:5></a> By eliminating this truth, the truth governing the household, and what issues from it, God is robbed.<a name=341:6></a> "Will a man rob God?<a name=341:7></a>" (<a href="../bible/Malachi.htm#3:8">Malachi  3:8</a>).<a name=341:8></a> I certainly would if I did not bring my household up for God, and how can I, save as I recognise this great principle of the believer's house, and the power especially to bring up my children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, so that they issue forth into the assembly?<a name=341:9></a> There is a contribution to the assembly in the power of the Spirit.<a name=341:10></a> Sin is not operative there, because the head of the house sees to it that there is nothing in the house that cannot be brought forward into the assembly.<a name=341:11></a> This is the second point.<a name=341:12></a> The third is the householder.<a name=341:13></a>

		Well now, this matter of reconciliation serves to bring God before us peculiarly, and first in His relation to the world as it is seen according to this verse in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11">Romans  11</a>.<a name=368:11></a> In the casting away of Israel judicially, God is not casting away for ever, only temporarily, thank God.<a name=368:12></a> Elymas the sorcerer typifies Israel in that way.<a name=368:13></a> God will return to His people.<a name=368:14></a> He has not cast them off finally, but they are cast away and made void for the moment, in order to bring the world in provisionally -- that is in the position of reconciliation.<a name=368:15></a> Now this needs to be understood by us or it will be very defective in our view, and I would explain it, dear brethren.<a name=368:16></a> When Scripture speaks of the world in reconciliation, it is not the world in a moral sense in all its lusts and wickedness, that is not the thought.<a name=368:17></a> Scripture says distinctly that <i>that</i> world lies in the wicked one.<a name=368:18></a> It is out of that world we are to be delivered.<a name=368:19></a> Christ died for our sins that He might deliver us out of this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father, that is morally.<a name=368:20></a> Salvation from the world is in a moral sense, but the world has to be viewed in another sense; that is, it has to be viewed creationally or physically.<a name=368:21></a> The world was made by Christ, but
