		B.T.<a name=1:3></a>F.<a name=1:4></a> Would you say that Romans was written with the intent of establishing believers in the principles of the gospel?<a name=1:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:6></a> I suppose so.<a name=1:7></a> Those to whom Paul wrote are addressed as saints, "called saints", so that the truth of the gospel is in that way communicated to believers and left with them.<a name=1:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.R.<a name=1:9></a>S.<a name=1:10></a> It is important to see that the gospel is about Christ.<a name=1:11></a> He is the Subject of it.<a name=1:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:13></a> It is a letter on the great subject of the gospel, and it is marked by apostolic authority, "Paul" being the first word in the letter.<a name=1:14></a> He is "a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God".<a name=1:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=1:16></a>M.<a name=1:17></a> Would you say that the epistle met the exercises existing at Rome?<a name=1:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:19></a> I would say that.<a name=1:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=1:21></a>M.<a name=1:22></a> Say a few words as to how it met those exercises.<a name=1:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:24></a> The assembly there was composed largely of immigrants from the East, and being in Rome they needed to be adjusted in regard to God, to each other, and to the governing powers that then existed, indeed, to the whole scheme of God's purpose as to the earth.<a name=1:25></a> But although Paul knew many of them personally, he did not know them as an assembly by means of a visit; his letter, however, would take the place of a visit, carrying with it all the authority of his mission from Christ, and at the same time setting out in the most orderly way, first of all the conditions

		that existed in the gentile world, and those existing in what you might call the cultivated world, Greek and Jew, and showing how God met all in Christ through redemption.<a name=2:1></a> Consequent on God's intervention in Christ and through accomplished righteousness in His death, the believer is adjusted in regard to all these things.<a name=2:2></a> There is also adjustment in regard to sin in the world, sin in the believer and the law.<a name=2:3></a> That is how the body of the epistle stands.<a name=2:4></a> We have also light as to God's faithfulness in regard to His promises to the Jews, and the believer's position on earth, that believers are one body in Christ; and then also, as I remarked, the believer's relations with the powers that existed, the governing powers.<a name=2:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.B.<a name=2:6></a> I suppose all these adjustments need to take place with us, as they did with the saints in earlier days.<a name=2:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:8></a> In these parts, to which we have immigrated, our circumstances are very much, speaking generally, like those of the saints in Rome; we have, at any rate, to come back to Romans constantly for adjustment.<a name=2:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=2:10></a>M.<a name=2:11></a> The thought of adjustment is perhaps not very easily taken in -- who or what is adjusted?<a name=2:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:13></a> Well, it is man.<a name=2:14></a> Man in responsibility is in view in Romans.<a name=2:15></a> He is not viewed as dead as in Ephesians or Colossians, but as alive, first in his sins and then as justified, but always in responsibility.<a name=2:16></a> He is regarded as alive and in the sphere of responsibility all through.<a name=2:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=2:18></a>M.<a name=2:19></a> So that adjustment is for the earth in that way.<a name=2:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:21></a> Yes; man is recovered for God here on earth, where the breakdown occurred.<a name=2:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.N.<a name=2:23></a>W.<a name=2:24></a> Heaven is not referred to much in Romans; this is worthy of notice, especially in view of the fact that many regard the gospel as simply a means of getting to heaven.<a name=2:25></a>

		<a name=3>[Page 3]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:1></a> It is adjustment on earth that is more particularly in view; the question was as to whether man could be righteously in relationship with God as on earth.<a name=3:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		B.T.<a name=3:3></a>F.<a name=3:4></a> The gospel then should be presented to men as such.<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:6></a> Yes; the epistle is an orderly setting forth of the truth of the gospel so as to meet the conditions that existed on the earth as the result of sin.<a name=3:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.N.<a name=3:8></a>W.<a name=3:9></a> The primary key to adjustment would be the recognition of the rights of God.<a name=3:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:11></a> That is the first thing we have to admit.<a name=3:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.B.<a name=3:13></a> Would you say that this epistle presents man as justified through faith, but in responsibility on the earth as under the authority of Another?<a name=3:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:15></a> Yes.<a name=3:16></a> As we go on in the epistle we shall see how it is worked out.<a name=3:17></a> First it is "the gospel of God", and it is "concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord".<a name=3:18></a> He is the theme of it, and so at the outset there is an Object for the heart.<a name=3:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.L.<a name=3:20></a>P.<a name=3:21></a> "He might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus" -- is that adjustment?<a name=3:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:23></a> Yes; that is in regard of God.<a name=3:24></a> We have here "the gospel of God", then there are "the glad tidings of the glory of the blessed God" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#1:11">1 Timothy  1:11</a>) also "the glad tidings of the unsearchable riches of the Christ" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:8">Ephesians  3:8</a>).<a name=3:25></a> These latter undoubtedly are extensions or developments, but what is immediately before the apostle here is the adjustment of things in regard to God.<a name=3:26></a> It was urgent then, and it is urgent now with everyone -- we must be adjusted in our souls in regard to God and everything that He recognises here on earth.<a name=3:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=3:28></a> That would bring men into righteousness.<a name=3:29></a> Righteousness is revealed in the gospel that men might be brought into righteousness; and there is revealed wrath against all unrighteousness, against ungodliness of men holding the truth in unrighteousness.<a name=3:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:1></a> The righteousness of God is revealed, and it is "on the principle of faith, to faith".<a name=4:2></a> Comparison between Romans, Colossians and Ephesians helps to show what characterises Romans, namely, the recognition of all that God had recognised before, and all that He then recognised.<a name=4:3></a> This is important, especially for young people.<a name=4:4></a> Living in the metropolis of the world, people would be apt to make much of Rome; this letter makes nothing of Rome as a city, but the apostle recognises Jew and gentile -- the Jew first, and the promises made to him.<a name=4:5></a> These things being taken up in this letter, and their absence from the other two letters help to an understanding of the difference in the teaching.<a name=4:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=4:7></a> Rome was held by men to be the centre, but it was not God's centre.<a name=4:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:9></a> No, it was the centre of the Babylonish system.<a name=4:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.B.<a name=4:11></a> Christ's sonship is emphasised here.<a name=4:12></a> It is introduced immediately.<a name=4:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:14></a> He is said to have "come of David's seed according to flesh", but "marked out Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of the dead".<a name=4:15></a> Christ is set before us as the Son of God, but He is also of David's seed; this and the reference to the Old Testament scriptures are significant.<a name=4:16></a> It is not here an arbitrary statement as to His deity; but one of what had come to light in a Man on the earth.<a name=4:17></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:1">John  1:1</a> we get, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God".<a name=4:18></a> That is an absolute statement of His deity; here what has been "declared", or "marked out", is referred to.<a name=4:19></a> He is marked out Son of God in power by resurrection.<a name=4:20></a> It is not here God raising Him, but what He did Himself.<a name=4:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=4:22></a>M.<a name=4:23></a> What is the force of "seed of David"?<a name=4:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:25></a> I think that it is that God is calling attention to what He had recognised before; Romans goes

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		back to that; it is not God's eternal thought.<a name=5:1></a> The reference is to what He had set up on earth before, and which He would maintain.<a name=5:2></a> He never loses a thread.<a name=5:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=5:4></a>M.<a name=5:5></a> Is that why we have so much of the kingdom in Romans?<a name=5:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:7></a> Yes; the kingdom is the exercise of God's grace in power in man; it is in Christ that the testimony introduced in David is made good.<a name=5:8></a> He was David's seed, but manifestly Son of God in power, for He raised the dead.<a name=5:9></a> What a mighty fact that One who had taken the form of a lowly Man was marked out thus as Son of God!<a name=5:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		B.T.<a name=5:11></a>F.<a name=5:12></a> Raising the dead referred to His ministry before He died.<a name=5:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.N.<a name=5:14></a>W.<a name=5:15></a> The point regarding the resurrection is most important.<a name=5:16></a> Here it is literally, 'resurrection of dead'.<a name=5:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:18></a> It refers to the power that marked His ministry; as He said to John the Baptist, "Dead are raised", (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11:5">Matthew  11:5</a>).<a name=5:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=5:20></a>M.<a name=5:21></a> It does not refer specially to His own resurrection.<a name=5:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:23></a> Of course it is true that He raised Himself from the dead (<a href="../bible/John.htm#2:19">John  2:19</a>), but, I think, the reference here is rather to what He did for others.<a name=5:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.N.<a name=5:25></a>W.<a name=5:26></a> Say a word about "the Spirit of holiness".<a name=5:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:28></a> It would show that everything He did was absolutely according to God; the Spirit of holiness was the Spirit in which things were done.<a name=5:29></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=5:30></a> It is in contrast to the way things were done by others.<a name=5:31></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=5:32></a>M.<a name=5:33></a> Speaking of resurrection -- is that involved in the adjustment of man, of which we have spoken?<a name=5:34></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:35></a> There can be no doubt; but the point here is that it witnesses to the Son of God.<a name=5:36></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		W.L.<a name=6:1></a>P.<a name=6:2></a> We have an instance of it in the raising of Lazarus.<a name=6:3></a> There was abundant evidence in that act that Christ was "Son of God with power".<a name=6:4></a>

		B.T.<a name=6:5></a>F.<a name=6:6></a> "Obedience of faith", the light of God presented in the gospel is responded to in this way.<a name=6:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:8></a> The gospel would tend to bring about subjection; we are elect through sanctification unto the obedience of Jesus Christ (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:2">1 Peter  1:2</a>).<a name=6:9></a> His obedience is the pattern for us.<a name=6:10></a> Here it is the "obedience of faith"; it is not an obedience that is brought about by arbitrary power as in the millennium.<a name=6:11></a> In commissioning Paul, the Lord did not have a result, such as Christendom now is, in His mind; He had no thought of making Europe what it has become.<a name=6:12></a> His purpose was that there should be "obedience of faith among all the nations".<a name=6:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:18></a> It is <i>that kind</i> of obedience, in contrast to what would be the result of arbitrary authority.<a name=6:19></a> It involves submission to the moral sway of Christ.<a name=6:20></a> The Holy Spirit is given to all those that obey Him (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#5:32">Acts  5:32</a>).<a name=6:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:24></a> God comes in in Christ, and the heart submits to Christ; no one is affected by the gospel until his heart is subdued.<a name=6:25></a> It is not compulsion in an arbitrary way, but moral; what is presented in Christ subdues the heart.<a name=6:26></a> I use <i>heart</i> as a general term; I mean that the man, the moral being, is subdued, and subdued willingly, so to speak.<a name=6:27></a> Romans is the overcoming of evil with good.<a name=6:28></a> All that God is is presented in Christ.<a name=6:29></a> This subdues and wins the heart.<a name=6:30></a> But it is through faith.<a name=6:31></a> Faith is emphasised in this epistle.<a name=6:32></a>

		J.T.<a name=7:17></a> It has been remarked by someone who knew Mr.<a name=7:18></a> Darby, that what impressed him most was his spirit, manifested specially by his prayers while he was alive, and now that he is gone as seen in his hymns.<a name=7:19></a> A letter is a substitute for a visit, but Paul shows here how superior the latter is.<a name=7:20></a> He longed to see the Romans that he might impart to them some spiritual gift.<a name=7:21></a> Evidently he could not impart a spiritual gift by a letter; he desired to <i>see them</i> in order to do that.<a name=7:22></a>

		READINGS ON THE EPISTLE TO THE ROMANS (2)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3:1">Romans  3:1</a> - 31
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=11:1></a> It may help, if you would give a few words as to what leads up to this chapter.<a name=11:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=11:3></a> Our remarks last time did not go beyond the earlier verses of chapter 1.<a name=11:4></a> We dwelt at length on the fact that Christ is "marked out Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of the dead"; and that it is "the gospel of God .<a name=11:5></a>.<a name=11:6></a>.<a name=11:7></a> concerning his Son".<a name=11:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think what came before us especially was that the epistle sets out the gospel in an orderly way; showing how God has come in in Christ for the recovery of man.<a name=11:9></a> So that the opening passages are rather introductory.<a name=11:10></a> Then, the state of the whole race of mankind is depicted in the second half of that chapter.<a name=11:11></a> Then, that division of the race that was, so to say, civilised and cultivated, especially the Greek, is taken account of in the early, part of chapter 2.<a name=11:12></a> Then the Jew, who had the law, is treated of.<a name=11:13></a> So that, "every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God".<a name=11:14></a> And now, in the latter part of chapter 3, God opens up His remedy in the gospel.<a name=11:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=11:16></a> The epistle thus becomes very comprehensive.<a name=11:17></a> There is nothing in scripture like it, as a presentation of the gospel to <i>all</i> men.<a name=11:18></a> You have been summarising up to the point where the righteous judgment of God rests upon all.<a name=11:19></a> It suggests, morally, what we get in the flood: God said, "The end of all flesh is come before me" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#6:13">Genesis  6:13</a>).<a name=11:20></a> Here the end of all flesh has come before God morally.<a name=11:21></a> Everyone is shut up to God.<a name=11:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=11:23></a> So that God is now free, having convicted all, to open up what He has in His mind as a remedy.<a name=11:24></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.L.<a name=12:1></a>P.<a name=12:2></a> Is that the reason both Jew and gentile are brought under the same judgment?<a name=12:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=12:4></a> At the end of chapter 1 it is man in general; but in chapter 2 the cultivated, or enlightened, sections of the race are dealt with, the Jew and the Greek.<a name=12:5></a> It says, "to Jew first and to Greek".<a name=12:6></a> I was noticing in the early part of chapter 2 how man is addressed, "O man".<a name=12:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=12:8></a> So that really it is a voice universal, not only to the Jew and the Greek, but to the barbarian; and not only in Paul's day but in every day.<a name=12:9></a> It is a universal voice, "O man".<a name=12:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=12:11></a> The address to man is very suggestive both in regard of judgment and of blessing.<a name=12:12></a> "Thou art inexcusable, O man, every one who judgest".<a name=12:13></a> The thought of <i>man</i> is prominent in certain sections of the Old Testament.<a name=12:14></a> In Ezekiel we see how that God, on the ground of the breakdown of the flesh in Israel in the presence of the law, widens out.<a name=12:15></a> Ezekiel himself is habitually addressed as "son of man".<a name=12:16></a> As if God were speaking to man in <i>the Son</i>.<a name=12:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=12:18></a> I suppose that in the gospels the counterpart of all this would be found in Luke.<a name=12:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=12:20></a> Luke is a sort of confirmation of Paul's doctrine, hence it is the "Son of man" who is presented there, having man in view.<a name=12:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=12:22></a> So that the point reached in chapter 5 would correspond very much with the prodigal son brought into the Father's house.<a name=12:23></a> "We are making our boast in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom now we have received the reconciliation".<a name=12:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		B.P.<a name=12:25></a> Had Judaism to break down before the general title, man, could be brought in?<a name=12:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=12:27></a> Judaism had broken down, so that in addressing man God shows what is in His mind.<a name=12:28></a> Only, in chapter 2 it is in a condemnatory way, "Thou art inexcusable, O man, every one who

		judgest".<a name=13:1></a> That is to say, man had forfeited the title to judge -- to judge another.<a name=13:2></a> There was reserved to him the responsibility of judging himself; but the incongruity of judging another, when guilty himself, is shown.<a name=13:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=13:4></a> It is significant that this aspect of the gospel should be addressed to the Romans, because all men were under the dominion of Rome; it was then the centre of the world.<a name=13:5></a> Now God would meet them on the ground of His righteousness.<a name=13:6></a> How masterly it is that everyone is first brought under the judgment of God.<a name=13:7></a> How can we judge one another?<a name=13:8></a> We are all a set of sinners -- criminals!<a name=13:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=13:10></a> That is the feature emphasised in chapter 2, the inexcusability of man, however cultivated, for the Greeks were cultivated; but how could they judge others when doing the same things themselves?<a name=13:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		B.T.<a name=13:12></a>F.<a name=13:13></a> Chapter 2 refers to Greeks who, perhaps, did not know God.<a name=13:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=13:15></a> I think so.<a name=13:16></a> The address at Athens by Paul formally states that they did not know God; in fact, their altar bore the inscription "To the unknown God".<a name=13:17></a> Paul says, "Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#17:23">Acts  17:23</a>).<a name=13:18></a> But they had certain knowledge which distinguished them from the ordinary heathen, and, on the ground of that, they set themselves up as judges.<a name=13:19></a> So the early part of chapter 2 is intended to convict the Greeks, and all such in all time, and to show the inexcusability of attempting to judge when the principle of self-judgment has not taken effect.<a name=13:20></a> It is that which brings in habitually, as you will observe, the judgment of God.<a name=13:21></a> "We know that the judgment of God is according to truth".<a name=13:22></a> That is, there was a judgment about these things; the very things they pretended to judge; but the only judgment which was of any account was the judgment which was according to truth.<a name=13:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=14:17></a> I think so.<a name=14:18></a> The flood was a known fact.<a name=14:19></a> The flood really stands at the beginning of the history of mankind viewed generally.<a name=14:20></a> It is a monument of God's judgment, and all the families of Noah would have that testimony.<a name=14:21></a> Besides, there is the statement: "The invisible things of him are perceived, being apprehended by the mind through the things that are made, both his eternal power and divinity, -- so as to render them inexcusable".<a name=14:22></a> There is, in that way, a witness in creation, and in the government of God, therefore, adequate testimony as to what He is as against evil.<a name=14:23></a> Chapter 1 is on that ground.<a name=14:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.R.<a name=14:25></a>S.<a name=14:26></a> Man had a witness.<a name=14:27></a> For instance, "The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament showeth his handywork" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#19:1">Psalm  19:1</a>).<a name=14:28></a> Any ordinary man must know the heavens were called into being by some power.<a name=14:29></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=28:1></a> It may be helpful to point out that chapter 3 from the 21st verse has reference to <i>revelation</i>, the word "manifested" being suggestive; whereas chapter 4 is more on the side of the believer, what he <i>finds</i>.<a name=28:2></a> The chapter opens with, "What shall we say then that Abraham our father according to flesh has found?<a name=28:3></a>".<a name=28:4></a> So that the two chapters, in that way, form a whole, one referring to what is for <i>all</i>, the other to what an individual <i>has found</i>.<a name=28:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=28:6></a>M.<a name=28:7></a> The end of chapter 3 would be far greater than what we have in chapter 4; as you say, it is a question of what God is.<a name=28:8></a> Would you mind, in that connection, saying a word upon this righteousness of God which is revealed?<a name=28:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=28:10></a> It has been called, His 'rights in mercy'.<a name=28:11></a> God has a right to be merciful; His nature really shines here.<a name=28:12></a> Paul in chapter 1 says, "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.<a name=28:13></a> For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith".<a name=28:14></a> That would not refer to His rights in judgment but to His rights in mercy.<a name=28:15></a> He will have mercy on whom He will have mercy.<a name=28:16></a> It pleases Him to have mercy upon all as this epistle shows.<a name=28:17></a> So that "the righteousness of God" would refer to His rights in mercy, coming out in Christ, and dealing with sin in Christ, viewed as a vicarious offering.<a name=28:18></a> As it is said, "that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus".<a name=28:19></a> That kind of righteousness should appeal to us.<a name=28:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.F.<a name=28:21></a>M.<a name=28:22></a> Hence it is introduced here so beautifully.<a name=28:23></a> God had a right to deal with man in judgment, but

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=29:2></a> Yes; and it is without the law.<a name=29:3></a> "Now without law righteousness of God is manifested, borne witness to by the law and the prophets; righteousness of God by faith of Jesus Christ towards all, and upon all those who believe".<a name=29:4></a> That is, perhaps, the most concise statement you could find of the gospel.<a name=29:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		B.T.<a name=29:6></a>F.<a name=29:7></a> What does, "Borne witness to by the law and the prophets" refer to?<a name=29:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=29:9></a> The types and general teaching in the law and in the prophets.<a name=29:10></a> We have been going over Exodus and Leviticus; for example, those books abound with references to the gospel as seen in the sacrifices and so on.<a name=29:11></a> The prophets, too, we know, abound with references to the same.<a name=29:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=29:13></a>M.<a name=29:14></a> So in chapter 1 it says, "which he had before promised by his prophets in holy writings".<a name=29:15></a> The gospel was the subject of promise.<a name=29:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.R.<a name=29:17></a>S.<a name=29:18></a> Is not one of the points in chapter 3 that man has his mouth stopped?<a name=29:19></a> There is no righteousness as far as man is concerned.<a name=29:20></a> Then God's righteousness is brought out and shines in all its grandeur, and it is on the ground of that that God blesses man.<a name=29:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=29:22></a> "Without law righteousness of God".<a name=29:23></a> It does not say <i>the</i> righteousness of God; but that kind of righteousness.<a name=29:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=29:25></a> God would have been perfectly righteous had He wiped out the whole scene and terminated it in judgment on account of sin; but He is also perfectly righteous when He presents Christ Jesus as a mercy-seat.<a name=29:26></a> "Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus; whom God has set forth a mercy-seat, through faith in his blood".<a name=29:27></a> There is thus a point where He can bless and redeem, instead of removing.<a name=29:28></a> He is equally righteous; and His righteousness works that way.<a name=29:29></a>

		C.A.<a name=30:6></a>M.<a name=30:7></a> In chapter 1 the apostle says, "I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also".<a name=30:8></a> It is remarkable that he should wish to preach the gospel to the <i>saints</i>.<a name=30:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=30:10></a> The saints at Rome evidently needed the moral foundation laid in their souls strengthened.<a name=30:11></a> This is also true of many at the present time.<a name=30:12></a> The gospel is not only to give us peace with God, but to establish us in regard to the world, and what is in it, because Christians are exposed to the world.<a name=30:13></a> The question is, are we to stand or be carried off our feet?<a name=30:14></a> At the present time nothing could be more essential to us than the knowledge of God, as presented in this epistle; for it is God as He is towards man in righteousness, and dealing with man as he is here, setting him up on this basis, so that he might stand here for God.<a name=30:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.F.<a name=30:16></a>M.<a name=30:17></a> We then are able to justify God in the presence of all that is without.<a name=30:18></a>

		J.T.<a name=30:28></a> That is the idea.<a name=30:29></a> The believer is made righteous and yet retains his conscience and then, he <i>lives</i>.<a name=30:30></a> So there is perfect reconciliation of the two principles -- responsibility and life.<a name=30:31></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=31:15></a> I think, "faith of Jesus Christ", and "faith of Jesus" lay the basis in the soul for the new order of Man.<a name=31:16></a> God has in His mind the transference in our souls from what we are as in Adam to Christ.<a name=31:17></a> He is presented to us objectively, and in believing we get light, but then, light about the Man who did the will of God.<a name=31:18></a> That is a formative principle.<a name=31:19></a>

		J.T.<a name=32:5></a> The anointed Man has finished everything and has sat down.<a name=32:6></a> "God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:36">Acts  2:36</a>).<a name=32:7></a> There, I apprehend God has set Him in heaven, and exalted Him as the Head and Centre of everything.<a name=32:8></a> He is the Head of everything.<a name=32:9></a> All therefore, is in Him.<a name=32:10></a> But, if I look at Him down here, as a Man doing the will of God and going into death, it is "Jesus Christ".<a name=32:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.F.<a name=32:12></a>M.<a name=32:13></a> How about the expression in verse 24, "through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus; whom God has set forth a mercy-seat"?<a name=32:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=32:15></a> There it is again.<a name=32:16></a> Redemption is in Him; "Through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus; whom God has set forth a mercy-seat, through faith in his blood, for the shewing forth of his righteousness, in respect of the passing by the sins that had taken place before, through the forbearance of God; for the shewing forth of his righteousness in the present time, so that he should be just, and justify him that is of the faith of Jesus".<a name=32:17></a> It seems to me that the one who is "of the faith of Jesus" is the one who is to be justified; because God has in His mind a race of men like that Man.<a name=32:18></a>

		J.T.<a name=32:21></a> I think the point in verse 25 is righteousness of God -- His rights in mercy, and the mercy-seat is the expression of it.<a name=32:22></a> It is there that God sets out what He is towards man, the point is, "whom God has set forth a mercy-seat, through faith in his blood".<a name=32:23></a> The reference is to <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#16">Leviticus  16</a>.<a name=32:24></a> It is a question of what is on the throne of God, really.<a name=32:25></a> So

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=33:12></a> The mercy-seat is the great central point of the whole moral system.<a name=33:13></a> God sets out in that Man, as having died (for it is a question of His blood here), His rights in mercy.<a name=33:14></a>

		J.T.<a name=34:5></a> This, I think, is necessarily the greatest of all; because it is a question of the whole universe and God setting Himself in relation to it in righteousness.<a name=34:6></a> How wonderful that He could do that!<a name=34:7></a> But the study of <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#16">Leviticus  16</a>enables us to see how it has all been accomplished -- that the blood of Christ was efficacious, as under the eye of God, for the whole universe.<a name=34:8></a> So every one who now is, "of the faith of Jesus" -- of that Man, is justified.<a name=34:9></a> And God is also justified in Him, "so that he should be just, and justify him that is of the faith of Jesus".<a name=34:10></a> The mercy-seat here is the great central point in the whole moral system.<a name=34:11></a> God puts Himself, in the eyes of all, as just in regard to the passing by of sins.<a name=34:12></a> As it says, "In respect of the passing by the sins that had taken place before, through the forbearance of God; for the shewing forth of his righteousness in the present time, so that he should be just".<a name=34:13></a> He waited all these years and in so doing exposed Himself to attack, looking on to the time of the incarnation and death of Christ, when He would be justified.<a name=34:14></a> And now that Christ has died He is justified in the eyes of the universe in regard of sins.<a name=34:15></a> That is the point here.<a name=34:16></a> Every one, who is "of the faith of Jesus" is linked up with God on that principle.<a name=34:17></a> So one can see how the thing is developed on the principle of faith before we get any mention of the Spirit or love.<a name=34:18></a> Here it is a question of linking the soul with God in righteousness.<a name=34:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=39:1></a> In dwelling on chapter 5 it is important to bear in mind that chapter 4 emphasises the "principle of faith".<a name=39:2></a> The principle of faith is seen throughout the book, we know, but chapter 4 seems to emphasise it as coming in after the mercy-seat.<a name=39:3></a> There is a point or two in chapter 4 to which it might be well to refer.<a name=39:4></a> It says in verses 13 - 17, "For it was not by law that the promise was to Abraham, or to his seed, that he should be heir of the world, but by righteousness of faith.<a name=39:5></a> For if they which are of law be heirs, faith is made vain, and the promise made of no effect.<a name=39:6></a> For law works wrath; but where no law is neither is there transgression.<a name=39:7></a> Therefore it is on the principle of faith, that it might be according to grace, in order to the promise being sure to all the seed, not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of Abraham's faith, who is father of us all, (according as it is written, I have made thee father of many nations)".<a name=39:8></a> It seems to me that we should pay especial attention to chapter 4 in that way; it is a sort of pivotal chapter from our side -- from the side of apprehension and appropriation.<a name=39:9></a> The light of chapter 3 being so wonderful, and then the blessings flowing therefrom in chapter 5 being also so wonderful, it is of great importance that attention should be paid to chapter 4 as showing how things are appropriated.<a name=39:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=54:1></a> It was suggested last time that we should have a word or two as to the advantage in the change of headship from Adam to Christ.<a name=54:2></a> The deliverance we get in that way is most important to understand.<a name=54:3></a> "By one man sin entered into the world, and by sin death" -- God's way out is through another Man, and <i>such</i> an One.<a name=54:4></a> It is to the end that "grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life".<a name=54:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=54:6></a> It forms in that way a turning point.<a name=54:7></a> The heart is drawn to that one Man, a necessity for whom existed from the outset.<a name=54:8></a> There is a great need of one man now, but the world is not prepared to make room for the true One.<a name=54:9></a> This chapter shows that all depends on Him, and that He has solved the question of righteousness and life.<a name=54:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.N.<a name=54:11></a>W.<a name=54:12></a> In this chapter the Lord is spoken of as "Christ Jesus", in the fifth as "Jesus Christ".<a name=54:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=54:14></a> I was going to remark in regard to that that the form of the expression alters in this chapter, it is "in Christ Jesus", whereas in the fifth it is "through Jesus Christ".<a name=54:15></a> The thought of the Man is prominent, I think, in the expression "Jesus Christ", and that of the anointing in the expression "Christ Jesus".<a name=54:16></a> "Jesus Christ" would be in accordance with your thought, the "One man" <i>by whom things are brought to pass</i>; here the great problem of righteousness and life is manifestly solved.<a name=54:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=55:3></a> The heart rests, it seems to me, in the expression in verse 15, "the free gift in grace, which is by the one man Jesus Christ, abounded unto the many".<a name=55:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=55:5></a>M.<a name=55:6></a> How do you understand the words, "much rather"?<a name=55:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=55:8></a> I think it suggests the abundance of things as compared with what Adam brought in.<a name=55:9></a> "Much rather" in this chapter suggests the abundance of the result come into the world through Christ.<a name=55:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=55:11></a>M.<a name=55:12></a> In what way do you mean abundance?<a name=55:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=55:14></a> Look at verse 17, "Much rather shall those who receive the abundance of grace, and of the free gift of righteousness".<a name=55:15></a> Notice the expression, "reign in life", not only <i>live</i>, but "reign in life by the one Jesus Christ".<a name=55:16></a> And so in verses 20 and 21 "Where sin abounded grace has overabounded, in order that, even as sin has reigned in the power of death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life".<a name=55:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.N.<a name=55:18></a>W.<a name=55:19></a> It is not only one Man, but "much more" by Him; and it is for all.<a name=55:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=55:21></a> Quite so; and what suggests it is the moral question involved, that of good and evil; it could not at all be solved through Adam even though he had remained in obedience.<a name=55:22></a> He could not have solved the great question of good and evil.<a name=55:23></a> This involved the attributes of God, all of which were infinitely satisfied and harmonised in Christ.<a name=55:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=55:25></a> The consequence flowing from Adam's deed is not only met, but God is glorified in respect of it, and there is a wondrous excess of grace; it reigns through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ.<a name=55:26></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=56:1></a> I think an examination of the Scriptures which treat of the divine attributes, such as righteousness, faithfulness, and you might say, love, will show that they enter into the abundance, the <i>much more</i>.<a name=56:2></a> The wonderful excess therefore is the result of what God is as revealed in Christ.<a name=56:3></a> It is therefore infinite.<a name=56:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=56:5></a> Is that not the basis of the question raised at the beginning of chapter 6?<a name=56:6></a> Sin abounding has brought out a marvellous excess of the grace of God.<a name=56:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=56:8></a> The question, "Should we continue in sin, that grace may abound?<a name=56:9></a>" is the point of view of the natural mind.<a name=56:10></a> How absolutely wanting in moral conceptions is the natural mind!<a name=56:11></a> That thought must be banished for ever out of the world in which these wonderful thoughts apply.<a name=56:12></a> The puny mind of man must be shut out when dealing with the thoughts of God; "Far be the thought", says the apostle.<a name=56:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		B.T.<a name=56:14></a>F.<a name=56:15></a> When is God's thought, expressed in the last verse of chapter 5, reached: "So also grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life"?<a name=56:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=56:17></a> I suppose the conditions required for it began with the presence of the Spirit here, on the ground of accomplished righteousness.<a name=56:18></a> The conditions of eternal life became effective then.<a name=56:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=57:4></a> The need existed, and any one who could meet it would necessarily be head.<a name=57:5></a> The need was expressed throughout the Old Testament, but no one came forward.<a name=57:6></a> Christ brings in what is moral; but what He is in His creatorial right is seen in Colossians.<a name=57:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=57:11></a> Yes, and it is important to see that, because it shows how the Lord acquires a place in our souls -- that which is His right; and what God is as revealed in Him.<a name=57:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		J.T.<a name=58:5></a> "We who have died to sin, how shall we still live in it?<a name=58:6></a>".<a name=58:7></a> It is a question for the soul, and if one has the moral element there, he answers to it.<a name=58:8></a>

		J.T.<a name=58:12></a> To meet the question the apostle introduces the teaching of baptism.<a name=58:13></a> God said, "Out of Egypt have I called my son" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#2:15">Matthew  2:15</a>).<a name=58:14></a> That is God's affection for the Son; but the believer (who is also a son) has to ask, why it is that he has to leave Egypt; so that baptism is the great issue of this chapter, and the apostle opens up the truth of it here (see verses 4,5).<a name=58:15></a> If you compare baptism in this chapter with the teaching based on it in Colossians, I think you will see that here we are regarded as dead to sin, whereas in Colossians as dead <i>from</i> it.<a name=58:16></a> In Romans the christian is here in the presence of sin, but the death of Christ is between him and it, it is a constant daily exercise; whereas in Colossians it is "from the elements of the world"; the believer faces heaven in Colossians.<a name=58:17></a>

		J.T.<a name=66:1></a> That which has engaged us heretofore might be regarded as referring to what is external, or outside of one, but this chapter deals with what is inside; the apostle speaks of it as "sin that dwelleth in me".<a name=66:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=66:3></a> As regards what was outside Paul could say, "Touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless" (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3:6">Philippians  3:6</a>).<a name=66:4></a> But, here, he makes it clear that there was one thing from which he could not escape, namely, what was inside, and to which "Thou shalt not lust" applied.<a name=66:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=66:6></a> In taking up man as fallen, God first takes account of the things characterising him that are undeniable and public -- his sins, and then, after chapter 5, certain things that affect him externally, especially death, and sin as dominating the world.<a name=66:7></a> Then He shows how sin is replaced by righteousness and death by eternal life.<a name=66:8></a> So all that which relates to man, viewed externally, is disposed of in the first six chapters -- the whole question of what has taken place on earth is answered.<a name=66:9></a> In verse 18 of chapter 6 we read, "Having got your freedom from sin, ye have become bondmen to righteousness".<a name=66:10></a> Then in verse 23, "For the wages of sin is death; but the act of favour of God, eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord".<a name=66:11></a> One's external position is thus adjusted in the latter part of chapter 6.<a name=66:12></a> In the place of sin there is righteousness, and instead of death being upon one's spirit, there is eternal life.<a name=66:13></a> Whereas, in this chapter and the following one we have that dealt with which is within the believer, and that is a more difficult problem to solve -- it is more complex.<a name=66:14></a>

		J.T.<a name=125:7></a> Chapter 9 is especially marked by the thought of sovereignty -- the principle of election -- showing that whatever claims the Jews had in the way of priority, they were necessarily founded on the sovereignty of God.<a name=125:8></a> The fact that Ishmael and Esau were shut out, although elder brethren, establishes the fact that Israel's position was on the ground of sovereignty.<a name=125:9></a> The feature in chapter 10 is, "The word" -- the preaching.<a name=125:10></a> "The word is near thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach".<a name=125:11></a> That was their position then.<a name=125:12></a> <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#30">Deuteronomy  30</a>is cited, when Israel is regarded as having failed absolutely: "For the word is very near to thee".<a name=125:13></a> It was not far away from them.<a name=125:14></a> So we have the sovereignty of God in chapter 9, the word and the preaching in chapter 10, and the ultimate reinstatement of Israel in chapter 11.<a name=125:15></a>

		J.T.<a name=134:5></a> The weaving out of this fabric from Old Testament material is very fine, adorned with New Testament thoughts; only all connected with the earth, but founded on the death of Christ.<a name=134:6></a> The heart of the apostle is moved at the end in the light of what God effects on the ground of His sovereign mercy, "O depth of riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!<a name=134:7></a> how unsearchable his judgments, and untraceable his ways!<a name=134:8></a> For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counsellor?<a name=134:9></a> or who has first given to him, and it shall be rendered to him?<a name=134:10></a> For of him, and through him, and for him, are all things: to him be glory for ever.<a name=134:11></a> Amen".<a name=134:12></a> It is like <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3">Ephesians  3</a>as regards the church, although it is the heavenly side there, "To him be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages.<a name=134:13></a> Amen".<a name=134:14></a> In Romans it is the adjustment of things on earth leading to worship.<a name=134:15></a> <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3">Ephesians  3</a>is the accomplishment of the counsels of God in connection with the church.<a name=134:16></a> It is a higher thought; but the heart is moved in both cases to worship God.<a name=134:17></a>

		J.D-s.<a name=136:7></a> It is remarkable how the apostle saw his way through things -- through the maze of things as they were affecting him and the saints of God in that day.<a name=136:8></a> And as he saw his way through them, he was able to give praise to God -- to fall back on the sovereignty of God and to call into his argument that God would be God, and would act for Himself, and from Himself, apart altogether from the failure.<a name=136:9></a> And when he saw how God was going to bring to pass that which pertained to the earth in His own good time, he was filled with praise and wonder.<a name=136:10></a> That was the meaning of the doxology -- the way God was going to effect things for Himself, and according to His pleasure, in connection with all pertaining to the earth; but more especially, in connection with His people to whom He had made the promises.<a name=136:11></a>

		J.T.<a name=154:4></a> I suppose, to apply the truth in a practical form to the saints in their varied relations, beginning with chapter 12.<a name=154:5></a> That chapter adjusts us in relation to one another, chapter 13 in regard of the government of the world outside, chapter 14 in regard of those who are weak in the faith; that is, there is consideration in the kingdom of God for the weak; instead of as in the world, the weak going to the wall, they are to be supported in the kingdom of God.<a name=154:6></a> In chapter 15 the Lord is brought in as a Pattern for us -- One who did not please Himself.<a name=154:7></a> In connection with the weak ones, we are not to please ourselves.<a name=154:8></a> The suggestion of what Christ is in that way leads on to the apostle's remarks about himself and his ministry.<a name=154:9></a> Chapter 16 is what you might call a letter of commendation.<a name=154:10></a> Chapter 14 is very applicable to the present time in view of questions arising which have to be settled with the Lord.<a name=154:11></a>

		J.T.<a name=224:11></a> Yes, that is the thought.<a name=224:12></a> It says in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:2">Revelation  22:2</a>, "In the midst of its street, and of the river, on this side and on that side, the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, in each month yielding its fruit".<a name=224:13></a> If He presents Himself to us as the Tree of Life in <i>the</i> midst of the spiritual universe, it is to the end that we are also to eat the fruits which He then gives us in such abundant measure.<a name=224:14></a> The disciples did this; for they rejoiced when they saw the Lord.<a name=224:15></a> In the assembly the Lord would like us also to rejoice.<a name=224:16></a> Then He said to them again, "Peace be to you", that is to say, 'I am so glad that you are spiritually rejoicing, that I should like to maintain you in it in peace'.<a name=224:17></a> Then He says, "As the Father sent me forth, I also send you".<a name=224:18></a>

		J.T.<a name=276:1></a> I thought we could consider together something as to divine instruction.<a name=276:2></a> When Paul came to Ephesus he found there twelve-men and said to them, "Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed?<a name=276:3></a>" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#19:1">Acts  19:1</a>,2).<a name=276:4></a> They said to him that they had not yet heard anything of the Holy Spirit; they had been baptised to the baptism of John.<a name=276:5></a> I only refer to this passage to show how much the people of God can suffer from defective instruction.<a name=276:6></a> The teaching of John was good, but it did not go far enough.<a name=276:7></a> Today in Christendom there is much instruction which is mingled with errors and there is instruction which does not reach to the height of the Christian position and thus does not go far enough.<a name=276:8></a> It is, therefore, so necessary that we come under the whole of divine instruction, as Paul says to the elders of Ephesus, "I have not shrunk from announcing to you all the counsel of God" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20:27">Acts  20:27</a>).<a name=276:9></a> Today the Spirit of God also wishes to lead <i>all</i> believers to <i>full</i> growth (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:13">Ephesians  4:13</a>).<a name=276:10></a> We have to learn everything from the Lord, and not only that but we have even to learn how we are to learn.<a name=276:11></a> In the passage read in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#50">Isaiah  50</a>the Lord shows us <i>how</i> we are to learn.<a name=276:12></a> The Lord Himself down here took up a learning attitude to show us an example.<a name=276:13></a> Wondrous grace that He who is God took up such a lowly position.<a name=276:14></a> He says in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#50:4">Isaiah  50:4</a>,5, "The Lord Jehovah hath given me the tongue of the instructed .<a name=276:15></a>.<a name=276:16></a>.<a name=276:17></a> He wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the instructed.<a name=276:18></a> The Lord Jehovah hath opened mine ear".<a name=276:19></a> It is noteworthy that we find this passage in the prophet Isaiah, where the "disciples" of the Lord are also spoken of, among whom "the testimony" and "the law" of God are sealed, "Bind

		J.T.<a name=335:1></a> Our enquiry this morning led us to the end of Exodus where we saw the tabernacle set up, and God having come in, the glory filling it.<a name=335:2></a> As having entered into the tabernacle to reside He is now to be served, hence the subject of the priesthood rightly follows what we had this morning.<a name=335:3></a> In the general instructions in Exodus we have in chapter 28 the requirement of the priesthood, "Thou shalt take thee Aaron thy brother, and his sons with him, from among the children of Israel, that he may serve me as priest", and in verse 41 of the same chapter it is said that his sons also are to be hallowed, "that they may serve me as priests".<a name=335:4></a> The chapter that we have read from Leviticus tells us that Moses carried out the directions in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#28">Exodus  28</a>and 29.<a name=335:5></a> What may be added to make the subject clear at the outset is that the verses in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#21">Exodus  21</a>speaking of the Hebrew servant teach us that the service is to be carried on in love.<a name=335:6></a> These verses typically set out our Lord Jesus Christ as taking a bondman's form.<a name=335:7></a> He does this in love, saying, "I love my master, my wife, and my children".<a name=335:8></a> He could have gone out free, as the passage teaches, at the end of six years, but because of love He remained a servant for ever.<a name=335:9></a> Now while the Lord Jesus took this lowly attitude in love, <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#28">Exodus  28</a>and 29 show that in this service He was clothed with heavenly dignity.<a name=335:10></a> Aaron is brother of the mediator, typically showing, as we see in the New Testament, that the mediator and the high priest are one Person -- Christ.<a name=335:11></a> So whether we think of mediatorship in Moses or priesthood in Aaron, it is the same Christ.<a name=335:12></a> He is a divine Person whether we view Him as Mediator or High Priest.<a name=335:13></a> So we are called upon as holy brethren, partakers of the

		heavenly calling, to consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession.<a name=336:1></a> While He in love takes the lowly place as a bondman, we have to regard Him in the dignity of a divine Person, so that in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#8">Hebrews  8</a>the writer by the Spirit of God says, "A summary of the things of which we are speaking is, We have such a one high priest who has sat down on the right hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens".<a name=336:2></a> Thus His deity is maintained and His priesthood, but still He has taken up the attitude of a servant in this dignity: and in Aaron and his sons as a type we see that the saints have part in this service.<a name=336:3></a> These remarks will help to make the subject clear to us that God, as coming in to dwell in the tabernacle, is to be ministered to in a priestly way.<a name=336:4></a>

		What is to be noticed is another thought here, namely, that this instruction comes in the book of Leviticus after we have had the instruction regarding the individual offerings.<a name=343:6></a> The suggestion is, as applied, that this great thought of the priestly system of service cannot be understood apart from the personal offerings indicated in the earlier chapters.<a name=343:7></a> The saints are viewed in chapter 1 as having some wealth, a bullock, a sheep or a fowl.<a name=343:8></a> God says, as it were, 'I have come in to dwell among you and I am waiting for your offerings'.<a name=343:9></a> We have the various offerings specified.<a name=343:10></a> If all Israel began to come with their offerings what delight there would be for the heart of God to see them coming with their cattle up to the door of the tabernacle; that is the moral side of the thing.<a name=343:11></a> It is practically useless for us to dwell on chapter 8 unless there be an answer to the desire of God for offerings in the earlier chapters.<a name=343:12></a> The offerer in chapters 1 to 5 comes to the tabernacle with his bullock, and he slaughters it himself.<a name=343:13></a> Then the sons of Aaron are there.<a name=343:14></a> That means in bringing the offering so near he takes on himself the priestly attitude, so that one by one the saints come up, and they become priests practically as they enter the court and offer their offerings.<a name=343:15></a> If all are offering, then we have a nation of priests, and chapter 8 would be understood.<a name=343:16></a> All these priests, acting in love and drawing near to God are related to Christ.<a name=343:17></a> That is how we reach the truth of priesthood.<a name=343:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=345:1></a> No book sets out more definitely the assembly in the wilderness than Numbers.<a name=345:2></a> The opening words make this very plain.<a name=345:3></a> "Jehovah spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai in the tent of meeting".<a name=345:4></a> The position is definitely the wilderness, and the tent of meeting is regarded as in it.<a name=345:5></a> The original title of this book was, "In the Wilderness", indicating that in earlier times the position was clearly apprehended.<a name=345:6></a> What the book unfolds is the public order of the saints viewed thus.<a name=345:7></a> So that we have stress laid on age -- twenty years of age, pedigree, then heads of houses -- persons of known moral weight amongst the saints.<a name=345:8></a> In verse 16 of chapter 1 we read, "These were those summoned of the assembly, princes of the tribes of their fathers, the heads of the thousands of Israel".<a name=345:9></a> Then there is the numbering, showing that everyone is taken account of, and in relation to his father's house.<a name=345:10></a> Each was to encamp by the standard of his father's house, showing that it is the public order of the saints in their local setting.<a name=345:11></a> Thus, it is, in the antitypical setting, the assembly throughout the whole world today, and the order and principles that govern the saints universally.<a name=345:12></a> I think we can see the correctness of the order in the place Numbers has in the Pentateuch.<a name=345:13></a> Exodus and Leviticus, especially Leviticus, contemplate the inner thing, the place the saints have inside the breastplate; each saint has got a fixed place there.<a name=345:14></a> Each saint is especially loved, and in correspondence with this each saint has his own position publicly.<a name=345:15></a>

		J.T.<a name=348:19></a> That is a very important enquiry.<a name=348:20></a> I think what is in mind in 1 Corinthians is the organisation; while the idea of eldership was supposed in persons of wisdom, yet what is in mind in 1 Corinthians is the organisation, and the organism; that is, <i>all</i> are brought into it.<a name=348:21></a> The address is to the assembly, meaning that every member is included in the responsibility, and the inner workings imply an organism, the figure of the human body being used; it is the fundamental thought in church furnishings.<a name=348:22></a>

		J.T.<a name=349:4></a> The whole number is given -- six hundred thousand.<a name=349:5></a> That is a suggestion of the whole assembly on earth; but the address to Corinth is to the assembly of God in Corinth, and then the whole is addressed as, "With all that in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both theirs and ours".<a name=349:6></a> Hence the address to localities -- all are included.<a name=349:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=349:11></a> There are two words used, according to the note in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#12">Exodus  12</a>.<a name=349:12></a> The word 'assembly' signifies a moral whole, involving responsibility.<a name=349:13></a> All may not be immediately available, but the principle attaches to those who are.<a name=349:14></a> The word 'congregation' means the whole <i>numerically</i>, that is all persons are included, an important matter in regard to what we are saying, because some may exempt themselves from responsibility.<a name=349:15></a> Here we have the latter thought because we have the exact number.<a name=349:16></a> The number is given in the end of chapter 2 -- six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty.<a name=349:17></a> Hence what is in mind in Numbers is both ideas: the idea of the assembly in Exodus, and the idea of the congregation.<a name=349:18></a> In the idea of the congregation every single person, every christian is responsible; but then, suppose some are absent, not available, can the assembly act?<a name=349:19></a> It can, and that is what the word in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#12">Exodus  12</a>means.<a name=349:20></a> It is one moral whole that is responsible and can act even though all may not be present: hence it would correspond to what we call an assembly

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=350:13></a> That fits in properly with chapter 2 which has in mind sovereignty as to how we are placed.<a name=350:14></a> First we have in chapter 1 each tribe numbered, so we have each tribe before us according to its numerical strength; then in chapter 2 these tribes are seen as amenable to being set in relation to others.<a name=350:15></a> What is suggested is that there is normal spirituality, involving subjection.<a name=350:16></a> Independency is entirely out of the question, so that God takes them up sovereignly.<a name=350:17></a> The first tribe mentioned in chapter 1 is Reuben.<a name=350:18></a> The first tribe mentioned in chapter 2 is Judah.<a name=350:19></a> Now I am in the presence of sovereign arrangement.<a name=350:20></a> Am I going to rebel against this?<a name=350:21></a> Does it suit me?<a name=350:22></a> If I am subject it will suit me, because it is the will of God.<a name=350:23></a> Thus, when the Lord cast out the demons from the man according to <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#5">Luke  5</a>, the man is seen sitting, clothed, and in his right mind at the feet of Jesus.<a name=350:24></a> That is the man that can be used in the formation of a local meeting.<a name=350:25></a> But he says to the Lord, 'I would like to go across the lake with You'.<a name=350:26></a> The Lord says, 'My mind is that you stay', and the man stays there; that is chapter 2; that is: those who are subject to Christ will stay where He places them.<a name=350:27></a> So it is a question of the sovereign order of God in the second chapter.<a name=350:28></a>

		Well now, I want to show you how, in the three passages in Genesis, knowledge such as I have been speaking of leads into another world, and enables me to move in that world according to it.<a name=369:4></a> So, in chapter 3 you have Adam naming his wife the second time.<a name=369:5></a> He had named her in chapter 2, but now he is naming her after he became a poor sinner, and she too had become a poor sinner.<a name=369:6></a> In chapter 2 Adam is more a type of Christ, and so Jehovah Elohim causes the creatures to come to Adam to see what he would name them, and whatever he named them that was the name of the creature -- God as it were commending his great creature for his intelligence.<a name=369:7></a> As I said, he is there a type of the Lord Jesus; and so, in the naming of Eve in that chapter, Jehovah Elohim presents a woman to him and Adam says, "This time it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh: this shall be called Woman, because this was taken out of a man".<a name=369:8></a> That is, he gives a reason for the name he gives her.<a name=369:9></a> There is nothing said as to this with the different lower creatures.<a name=369:10></a> We are not told that Adam gave the reason for the names he gave them, but here there is a reason, and bound up with it is the church as taken out of Christ, bone of His bones and flesh of His flesh.<a name=369:11></a> But in chapter 3 we have in Adam one like ourselves, a poor sinner, and an Eve like one of ourselves, a poor sinner.<a name=369:12></a> I say poor, but yet not poor, for there is evidence that they had faith, for God had clothed them.<a name=369:13></a> One of the most interesting transactions of God was the making of suits of clothes for Adam and Eve.<a name=369:14></a> Can we doubt that Adam gathered up intelligence in this?<a name=369:15></a> Moreover, God had said that the seed of the woman

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=375:1></a> The work of God as such is more stressed by John than by any of the other evangelists.<a name=375:2></a> In this there is a special correspondence to the book of Genesis, which enlarges upon how God's work brings order out of confusion.<a name=375:3></a> The man in this chapter answers to the state of disorder with which God occupied Himself in Genesis.<a name=375:4></a> The Lord said that this man had not sinned, nor his parents, but that the works of God should be manifested in him, and so this chapter helps us in connection with all that asserts to be a work of God.<a name=375:5></a> The work of God proves itself by certain moral features in those who are the subjects of it.<a name=375:6></a> My thought for this reading is that we should acquire a judgment about all that is transpiring and recognise how far these moral traits come into evidence.<a name=375:7></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=375:12></a> That passage agrees in a remarkable way with the introductory verses of Genesis.<a name=375:13></a> At the outset it is established that God in the beginning created the heaven and the earth, and then immediately the waste condition is referred to, "the earth was waste and empty, and darkness was on the face of the deep".<a name=375:14></a> In Genesis God says, "Let there be light.<a name=375:15></a> And there was light".<a name=375:16></a> In the gospel of John God does not simply say, "Let there be light", but the true Light is there, who, coming into the world, lightens every man; (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:9">John  1:9</a>).<a name=375:17></a> The work of God consists therefore in light.<a name=375:18></a>

		It is on my heart to call attention to the fact that what marks David's and Solomon's writings is the bringing into expression of deep feelings and affections.<a name=427:1></a> They directly set forth, so to speak, the heart of the Old Testament, or better still, the heart and soul of the Old Testament.<a name=427:2></a> They remind us that God wishes His people in their walk to bring into expression the feelings and affections produced by Himself.<a name=427:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Among other things may be remarked that these feelings and affections proceed from two kings, that is, from men who have an immense circle of influence.<a name=427:4></a> We might have thought that poetry and authorship were to be left to others, that men like David and Solomon would have had so much to do with military and state affairs, that you could hardly expect them to devote their time to such employment.<a name=427:5></a> In this service, however, they reflect what God and Christ are.<a name=427:6></a> To make it clear, I would refer to the fact that when God, in the company of two others, came to Abraham, He could wait until Abraham had prepared a meal, and also that our Lord Jesus Christ could devote so much time to going after two dissatisfied disciples on the way to Emmaus.<a name=427:7></a> It further moves us to see that the Father and the Son could so stoop, devoting themselves even to an individual who loves the Lord and keeps His word, for the Father and the Son would come and make Their abode with him (<a href="../bible/John.htm#14:23">John  14:23</a>).<a name=427:8></a> If we take all this into consideration we can understand how David could find time to write psalms and Solomon three thousand proverbs and a thousand and five songs (<a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#4:32">1 Kings  4:32</a>).<a name=427:9></a> Just think of it, that the great ruler of that day was able to devote himself to such a service!<a name=427:10></a>

		Solomon's".<a name=428:1></a> It is a poem by one who is a type of Christ, in which he celebrates the triumph of the love of Christ to a special person.<a name=428:2></a> In it the Lord wishes to remind every one of us of His triumph in securing us, in order that we, recognising His love, may love Him.<a name=428:3></a> To heaven it is something wonderful that there are in this world those who love Christ.<a name=428:4></a> He treasures every one of those who love Him; and every one of them says, He "has loved me and given himself for me" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:20">Galatians  2:20</a>).<a name=428:5></a> The apostle Paul, who probably loved Christ the most, shows in another place that the thought of not loving Christ is entirely abhorrent, for he says, "If any one love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#16:22">1 Corinthians  16:22</a>).<a name=428:6></a> If any one does not love our Lord Jesus Christ he is incapable of loving.<a name=428:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this song shows how this love is brought about, and from the verses read in chapter 1 we see how the lover of Christ comes to ask Him where He feeds His flock and makes it to rest at noon.<a name=428:8></a> Whoever loves Christ wishes also to see how He serves the whole of His flock.<a name=428:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That leads us to the service of the Lord to the saints of the assembly; there we see His best service.<a name=428:10></a> That is set forth in type in Jacob -- how quickly he rolled the stone from the mouth of the well when he saw Rachel (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#29:10">Genesis  29:10</a>) -- and so Christ also devotes the best service to the saints who compose the assembly.<a name=428:11></a> We can therefore understand the desire of this lover of Christ to see Him serving thus, and on this account the bride says here, "Why should I be as one veiled beside the flocks of thy companions?<a name=428:12></a>" One veiled refers to someone whose love is questionable or at any rate is divided.<a name=428:13></a> "Why should I be as one veiled beside the flocks of thy companions?<a name=428:14></a>" Why should our love to Christ be questioned?<a name=428:15></a> If anyone has not come forward and committed himself to the fellowship of the people of

		Having said all that about chapter 1, I should like to add something about chapter 2.<a name=430:9></a> There we see that the believer, set forth in a woman, regards himself as a narcissus of Sharon -- a wonderful product.<a name=430:10></a> The believer comes here to such intimacy with the Lord and His people that he is conscious of what he is in the Lord's eyes -- "a lily of the valleys", and then the Bridegroom says, "As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters".<a name=430:11></a> There we have what one is who loves Christ and that in a scene of contrariety, and now that <i>He</i> has made the start, <i>she</i> also says, in a figurative way, what she thinks of Him, and in that way there comes into expression the progress which the believer makes, "As the apple-tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons".<a name=430:12></a> He is not among thorns but among sons.<a name=430:13></a> There <i>we</i> wish to see Him; there, among sons, He will be loved eternally, but He will be anointed above them.<a name=430:14></a> It is therefore good to have this comparison before us, for in truth we shall know the Lord Jesus in this way in heaven; there He will be known among the sons and among His brethren.<a name=430:15></a> The one who loves Him will, however, soon discover

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have other scriptures in mind to allude to, but I content myself with this for the moment, as it contains what I have in mind to present, namely, that divine support is available to those who recognise the house of God.<a name=433:1></a> From the time of its introduction in the history of the testimony, we find divine help associated with it.<a name=433:2></a> I have in mind that we may look together at the facts attendant upon the truth of the house and its continuance as in the Old Testament, and as we look at these facts we shall find evidence of divine help.<a name=433:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But I wish first to call attention to the apostle Paul, who is pre-eminently connected with the house of God.<a name=433:4></a> He was concerned that we should all know how to behave ourselves in it, and he himself is the model in that way.<a name=433:5></a> He is presented in the scripture as one who particularly had help from God.<a name=433:6></a> You recall how in his defence before Agrippa he refers to this: "Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day".<a name=433:7></a>

		Doubtless there are those who are around us at the present time who are available for help, but the question is -- is it help which is from God?<a name=433:8></a> "Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#26:22">Acts  26:22</a>), as if to imply that God was his help and without that help continuance was impossible; and in continuing he announced nothing different from what the prophets had announced.<a name=433:9></a> He completed the word of God, but his testimony was in keeping with the prophets; it was marked by consistency with all that had preceded him.<a name=433:10></a> You will recall how that going to the city of Corinth he lodged with a man and his wife who had come from Rome, and because they were of the same craft he

		One loves to dwell upon Paul, the great apostle to the gentiles, lodging at Corinth as an artisan.<a name=434:5></a> He had the full light of God as to what God was building.<a name=434:6></a> The structure was in the nature of a tent for the moment, but the building was going on.<a name=434:7></a> The apostle being at Corinth the Lord appears to him, saying, "Fear not, but speak and be not silent; because <i>I</i> am with thee, and no one shall set upon thee to injure thee; because I have much people in this city".<a name=434:8></a> Knowing what opposition there was, He also knew that there was much people there.<a name=434:9></a> These people were to be enlightened by Paul.<a name=434:10></a> They were to be formed into an assembly; they were to become part of the house of God.<a name=434:11></a> And so the Lord said to His servant that He was with him.<a name=434:12></a> I want that we should take this in.<a name=434:13></a> The work is going on; it may be outwardly small, but in the light of faith it is a great work.<a name=434:14></a> It can only be carried on with the help which comes from God.<a name=434:15></a> "<i>I</i> am with thee" -- and so the apostle continued there one and a half years teaching the word of God among them.<a name=434:16></a>
