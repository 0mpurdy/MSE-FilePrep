		These scriptures instruct us as to the Lord's disposal of those whom He can use in His service.<a name=1:3></a> I need not add that these include all His own; for although we may not be commissioned, yet as believers we are all held for service, and the obligation to serve in due course attaches to each believer.<a name=1:4></a> Moreover, a particular service is assigned by the Lord to each, so that these passages are to instruct the youngest amongst us as well as the oldest.<a name=1:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I would remark as to the young, that the work of God in them will always show itself in outward smallness, the Lord Himself being the example for us, from the outset of our spiritual history.<a name=1:6></a> We are told that in youthfulness He was in the temple sitting in the midst of the doctors, not seeking out persons of His own age, but in the midst of the doctors.<a name=1:7></a> The young would do well to follow that as an example; and whilst not specially accrediting the doctors of Jerusalem, the suggestion is that they were persons who had knowledge; and at that stage of the Lord's life such an attitude was seemly.<a name=1:8></a> He sat in the midst of them.<a name=1:9></a> He was not <i>teaching</i> them as yet.<a name=1:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is well that the young people should learn how to sit in the midst of those who know more than they; not that that applies to our Lord, because He is a divine Person, but as an example He was sitting there, both hearing and asking questions.<a name=1:11></a> That is another important thing, because you may hear many things that are not quite clear to you, and it is well to ask questions.<a name=1:12></a> He sat there as the instructed, as He had

		referred to Himself in spirit in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#50">Isaiah  50</a>.<a name=2:1></a> He was given the tongue of the instructed that He might speak a word to him that was weary, and then His ear was opened as the instructed.<a name=2:2></a> Such was the wonderful stoop of our Lord in becoming Man, His attitude was perfectly right and seemly in every stage of His blessed life here on earth.<a name=2:3></a> He both heard and asked questions.<a name=2:4></a> I am only referring to the Lord as an <i>example</i>.<a name=2:5></a> Understanding is a feature of the work of God <i>in us</i>, it implies ability to take in the thoughts presented.<a name=2:6></a> I speak to the young, that you may see how you are brought into this and learn how to be at the Lord's disposal at all times.<a name=2:7></a> There is a beautiful word in <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#23:8">2 Samuel  23:8</a> about David's mighty men, their names are given, they belonged to him, they were part of his great realm, his kingdom, and one feature was that he <i>had</i> them.<a name=2:8></a> "These are the names of the mighty men whom David had".<a name=2:9></a> The position is that they were at his disposal.<a name=2:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mark opens up this thought, having service in mind, for in the Lord's time, the time of the apostles, and in every period since in the history of the assembly, the need of service has been great.<a name=2:11></a> Mark is specially intended to qualify us for service, so that it is a question of those whom the Lord has, and how He disposes of them.<a name=2:12></a> As you will see later in chapter 14, in the supreme crisis of His life He says to some, "Sit here".<a name=2:13></a> It is important to learn how to sit, as the Lord tells some here to do.<a name=2:14></a> I am not now opening up the supreme crisis of His life, that is too great a subject to bring in subordinately, but only point out that they are at His disposal, as He says to some, "Sit here while I shall pray": and then He takes three others with Him, and begins to be sorrowful and depressed.<a name=2:15></a> The scene is wonderful.<a name=2:16></a> He says, "Abide here and watch".<a name=2:17></a> They are at His disposal.<a name=2:18></a> In the supreme crisis He places His own, with perfect

	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 3 you will observe that He went up into a mountain, thus reminding His disciples that the service requires energy, it is not armchair service.<a name=3:3></a> You will note that there is nothing said at the outset about beds or sitting places in the tabernacle.<a name=3:4></a> It is a mark of decline, as, for instance, in 1 Samuel, where we are told that Eli the priest sat on the seat by the door post, and that he lay in the temple, and when the young Samuel was brought to the temple he also lay there.<a name=3:5></a> No provision is made for that in Exodus, so that it is not in accord with the tabernacle position.<a name=3:6></a> The first movement here in Mark indicates that they are not lying down in the temple, nor taking their ease as in the days of Haggai, but going up to the mountain.<a name=3:7></a> It requires energy of purpose and strength of heart to go up.<a name=3:8></a> You will observe: "he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he would: and they came unto him".<a name=3:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In that position there are those whom He can call.<a name=3:10></a> If there be no energy, or if there be no purpose of heart, they will not go.<a name=3:11></a> And if the eye is not on Jesus there will be reluctance or refusal to go up, and a preference to sit down below where things are easier and where no energy is required.<a name=3:12></a> Whilst we may put much energy into other things, such as sports and business, we may fail in spiritual energy, and that is what counts.<a name=3:13></a> The mountain is not only moral elevation but it requires energy and purpose of heart to reach the top.<a name=3:14></a> The Lord is there.<a name=3:15></a> Why did He not take them up, why did He not call them on the plain?<a name=3:16></a> Surely there is a meaning in that.<a name=3:17></a> According to Luke, after appointing the twelve He comes down with them to the plain, where men are, but here the call is from the top, requiring purpose; and it says, "they came unto him, and he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to

		preach, and to have power to heal sickness, and to cast out devils".<a name=4:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The thought of the position on the mountain and the obedient response to the Lord's call, is easily understood.<a name=4:2></a> He called whom He would, it was His own selection.<a name=4:3></a> There is no call for volunteers here, that is not the principle on which the service of God is carried on; it is on the principle of sovereign selection.<a name=4:4></a> He knows those who are suitable, and He will make His own selection.<a name=4:5></a> They answered His call, and then it says, "he ordained twelve, that they should be with him".<a name=4:6></a> We have to test our companionship as soon as this call is heard.<a name=4:7></a> The companionship is that of the Lord Jesus, to be <i>with Him</i>, "that he might send them forth to preach".<a name=4:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There can be no competency in preaching apart from being with Him and coming under His influence, seeing how He does things.<a name=4:9></a> That is largely the purpose of the four gospels, in confirmation of the epistles and the great work of God in the twelve and in Paul -- to set out the perfection of things in Christ, so that we might learn from Him.<a name=4:10></a> Whilst you may learn from Paul and others, the more you advance in the truth, the more you wish to arrive at the full divine standard, for that is the idea of the gospels -- so that they should be <i>with Him</i>, and that <i>He</i> might send them forth to preach.<a name=4:11></a> Not only that, they must have power to heal diseases and cast out devils; the preaching must be accompanied with such power.<a name=4:12></a> You will understand that I am not speaking of the great miraculous powers granted to the disciples in the establishment of christianity in this world, but there is something akin to that, which must go with the preaching; for diseases in a spiritual sense are found now amongst the Lord's people.<a name=4:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not so much today the question of preaching amongst the heathen, the work is now in the main amongst the Lord's people; and diseases and the power

		of Satan are very prevalent, not in the sense of demon possession, for that is rare in christendom, though it is not rare in heathendom.<a name=5:1></a> Let us not forget, however, that this does not mean that satanic power is rare in Christendom (see <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2:24">Revelation  2:24</a>).<a name=5:2></a> The Spirit of God calls attention to the "depths of Satan" in christendom.<a name=5:3></a> The agents of the devil are active about us, so that there must be something today, akin to the power to heal disease and cast out demons, to cope with satanic power.<a name=5:4></a> If you go out in the Lord's service you must expect satanic opposition, and you have to learn how to cope with it.<a name=5:5></a> Before entering on His service the Lord entered the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.<a name=5:6></a> This is the first feature of what I have before me.<a name=5:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next feature is that of one being left, at the Lord's direction, in an isolated position.<a name=5:8></a> One always thinks with great sympathy of isolated saints.<a name=5:9></a> If one might refer to one's own prayers, India, Ceylon, Egypt and Russia have the foremost place, because isolation, whether it be of one or of a few saints, exposes them to the bitter winds.<a name=5:10></a> Like the peak of a mountain range, the higher the summit the more exposure to the bitter cold winds.<a name=5:11></a> The heat of the earth below is not available there.<a name=5:12></a> The nearer we are to the company of christians the more protection and warmth we enjoy.<a name=5:13></a> Isolation exposes us, but the Lord knows that, and He provides for it.<a name=5:14></a> He knows what will stand the test before He makes His dispositions of His people.<a name=5:15></a> If He has put us in isolated places He has thought it out well, it is <i>His</i> placing.<a name=5:16></a>

		In this country, called Decapolis, the place of ten cities, the inhabitants did not want the Lord.<a name=5:17></a> I need not remind you that the concentration of men, of human beings, means the concentration of evil, even now, alas!<a name=5:18></a> The formation of cities began with Cain, and found an answer in Babel and has gone on ever since.<a name=5:19></a> God has checked it from time to time, but

	<div class="paragraph">
		there never has been such a time of cities as the present, and that means that evil has increased power in this world; so that Decapolis, the place of ten cities, is not without significance.<a name=6:1></a> It is a place of peculiar satanic power, and this man was in a terrible state, he is spoken of as "possessed by demons", legion we are told.<a name=6:2></a> Luke enlarges on that, and that he came out of the city suggestive of what the cities are.<a name=6:3></a> You all know about this man, this incident is rightly one of the most used in the gospel.<a name=6:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The point in my mind is that when the Lord went into the ship to depart, and that at a time when the whole country was hostile to Him, there was no one favourable to Him at all, it was at that particular time that the man besought the Lord "that he might be with him".<a name=6:5></a> You might say, 'Surely the Lord will let him come with Him, what is there for him in this terrible place, ten cities, this place of concentrated evil?<a name=6:6></a> He will be overwhelmed with the power of Satan in this place'.<a name=6:7></a> We might say that, but the Lord thought differently; the word is that Jesus "suffered him not, but says to him, Go to thine home to thine own people, and tell them how great things the Lord has done for thee, and has had mercy on thee".<a name=6:8></a> Then we are told that, "he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him; and all wondered".<a name=6:9></a> What a result!<a name=6:10></a> He is not coming under the power of Decapolis.<a name=6:11></a> The Lord had made no mistake in this, He had this in mind in casting out the demons, and so in taking up each one of us, He has in mind to break the power of evil in us and that we might get a place assigned to us by Him.<a name=6:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing is that this testimony is to be rendered in the very spot where, as under the power of the demons, the man had dishonoured God in the most dreadful way.<a name=6:13></a> Is that country to be left?<a name=6:14></a> Is he to be taken away out of it?<a name=6:15></a> No, beloved brethren, the idea is

	<div class="paragraph">
		that if the demons are cast out you are to be left where you have been the vessel of the demons, to be a vessel under God's power, that is the idea.<a name=7:1></a> One great feature of the assembly's place in this world is that believers are taken up where they have lived in their sinfulness, to stand for God.<a name=7:2></a> There is nothing more said about this man and what became of him, or as to whether an assembly was formed in Decapolis, but there could be little doubt that there were assemblies formed there, for that is the end in view.<a name=7:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What is said is that he "began to proclaim", we are not told when he ended.<a name=7:4></a> Heaven alone knows that, it is in God's book.<a name=7:5></a> It is a fine example.<a name=7:6></a> He began, and all marvelled, that was the result.<a name=7:7></a> I have no doubt that this man continued to preach, and that not only did they marvel, but they would believe, there was a positive testimony in the man.<a name=7:8></a> The Lord says, "Go home to thy friends", he was to go to those that knew him, "and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee".<a name=7:9></a> That is the thing to get hold of, what one man can do.<a name=7:10></a> Think of a lone believer in Jesus standing up in a country where the people had recently asked the Lord to leave the place!<a name=7:11></a> Think of him standing up, in Decapolis, the place of ten cities, and telling men what Jesus had done for him!<a name=7:12></a> I would like this to sink into our hearts, because there should be a result in taking up any service for the Lord and coming under His disposal.<a name=7:13></a> The next thing is some little evidence that people can take account of.<a name=7:14></a> This case is remarkable, "all wondered".<a name=7:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 14, we have the thing set out in the most striking manner.<a name=7:16></a> As I remarked, it is the supreme crisis of the Lord's blessed life and service in this world.<a name=7:17></a> There will never be such a crisis as this again.<a name=7:18></a> It could only happen once; but it happened, and whilst it detains the heart, as no other passage does, in regard of our Lord in His untold sufferings, it affords remarkable instruction in regard of what I am saying,

		that the Lord is disposing of what is under His hand.<a name=8:1></a> You may say they were a poor lot.<a name=8:2></a> The sequel shows even the most select three of them went to sleep in the position to which they were assigned.<a name=8:3></a> It is remarkable that the Spirit of God should record this.<a name=8:4></a> He would never uncover the failure of a saint unless it may be used to preserve another saint from that failure.<a name=8:5></a> These dear men, Peter, James and John, bear the shame in that this record about them has been read by millions of christians.<a name=8:6></a> They would thankfully accept the shame, for it has been effective, in the Lord's good hand, to save others from a like failure.<a name=8:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The word Gethsemane is used in this gospel, and in Matthew; it alludes to <i>pressure</i>, and let no one who essays to be under the Lord's hand, hope to evade pressure, at least at some time.<a name=8:8></a> Gethsemane alludes to that; pressure after pressure will come, crisis after crisis in the history of the testimony will come, and the Lord will make dispositions of what may be under His hand.<a name=8:9></a> The <i>best</i> of them went to sleep, as we have seen.<a name=8:10></a> You might say, I would not have done that, but then that is just the point, you <i>would</i> have done that.<a name=8:11></a> That is what you and I are capable of naturally.<a name=8:12></a> These men were only samples, so that we should learn from them negatively, and see to it that we do not go that way.<a name=8:13></a> We have the Holy Spirit now, they had not then; so that they are a sample of what the flesh is capable of, but in the recognition of the Spirit of God come down from heaven, there is no need of this at all.<a name=8:14></a> We have the means, which they had not, of complying with the Lord's requirements, but if we do not use the means we have, we are no better than they.<a name=8:15></a> We do not understand what we have in the house.<a name=8:16></a> Elisha said to the widow who was in debt, "What hast thou in the house?<a name=8:17></a>" (<a href="../bible/2Kings.htm#4:2">2 Kings  4:2</a>).<a name=8:18></a> It is in the recognition of the pot of oil and the use made of it, that we can comply with requirements.<a name=8:19></a>

		to sit than to be active.<a name=9:1></a> Oft-times people show they should be sitting when they are not.<a name=9:2></a> The Lord says, "Sit here while I shall pray".<a name=9:3></a> We can afford to be restful when the Lord is praying.<a name=9:4></a> To extend the thought, the Lord is always interceding for us.<a name=9:5></a> No doubt He prayed for them here, although the passage speaks only of His prayers for Himself.<a name=9:6></a> He spoke in these wonderful words, written indelibly, "Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt" (chapter 14:36).<a name=9:7></a> Mark gives us that beautiful touch; but the Lord is speaking of His own matter here.<a name=9:8></a> There is no such personal matter with Him now.<a name=9:9></a> The matter now is the saints down here, "he ever liveth to make intercession for them" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#7:25">Hebrews  7:25</a>).<a name=9:10></a> Think of that, as if He had nothing else to do.<a name=9:11></a> The Spirit of God would stress that, not that He has not other things, but "he ever liveth to make intercession".<a name=9:12></a> He says, "Sit here, while I shall pray": now while we are to sit it is surely with intentness.<a name=9:13></a> Then He goes forward with the other three.<a name=9:14></a> The actual agony takes place in their presence.<a name=9:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The scripture says, "he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy".<a name=9:16></a> I was saying that it was in their presence, He went forward a little, but He made these statements to them before He went forward.<a name=9:17></a> He selected these men.<a name=9:18></a> In His mind they were evidently fit for this.<a name=9:19></a> It was only potential, because they failed in it, but they did not fail afterwards, they went through all this in their spirits afterwards, for they were martyred, but He brought them into it, and told them about <i>His</i> exercise.<a name=9:20></a> Think of the privilege afforded to them!<a name=9:21></a> And so in these crises of the assembly, which come one after another, the Lord will say to some of us, "Sit [not listlessly, but carefully] here while I shall pray", and He would take others forward into the conflict, into the very place of the greatest pressure, and then He would say how <i>He</i> feels about things.<a name=9:22></a>

		He says, "abide here and watch".<a name=10:1></a> He does not say that to the others, the point with them is to <i>sit</i>.<a name=10:2></a> Then He says later, <i>pray</i>.<a name=10:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is the position in every crisis.<a name=10:4></a> There are those who are wisely sitting and discerning, when the Lord is praying; and there are others who are brought forward into the conflict, into the very teeth of the enemy; and then the Lord goes further, because He can go further than any of us.<a name=10:5></a> At all times He goes ahead, like the ark of old, which went ahead to find a resting-place, and that modifies the power of the enemy for us.<a name=10:6></a> He breaks the power of the enemy's wave, but it comes upon us, and hence the urgency, as disposed of by Him in that position, to watch and pray, "lest ye enter into temptation".<a name=10:7></a> This marks every crisis, and they come one after another, and there will be no end of them while the assembly is here; so it is a question of each knowing how to be disposed of, taking his place at the Lord's wise disposition and remaining in it, according to the word He gives us.<a name=10:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To carry the thought on, we have the sad history of unbelief portrayed in this gospel more than in any of the others.<a name=10:9></a> Mark stresses the unbelief of the disciples.<a name=10:10></a> If you look at chapter 16 you will be struck with the thought that if the Lord had not taken the matter in hand <i>Himself</i>, in spite of the appearing at His sepulchre, the testimony would have fallen to the ground, because the disciples were wholly unequal to it through <i>unbelief</i>.<a name=10:11></a> Why is all that recorded?<a name=10:12></a> Surely that we might be aware of the danger of unbelief, it is always lurking in our hearts, and would rob us of the victory that is within our grasp.<a name=10:13></a>

		You will observe in verse 9, "Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene".<a name=10:14></a> The verses from 9 to the end of the chapter, are questioned by some critics, but they are Scripture, intensely so.<a name=10:15></a> They are brought

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In verse 8, while honourable reference is made to the women, we are told that, "they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they anything to any man; for they were afraid".<a name=11:3></a> Of what good was that behaviour?<a name=11:4></a> They had seen wonderful things, they had seen evidence that the Lord was risen, they had the testimony of His resurrection from the "young man", but they were amazed and trembled and said nothing to any man.<a name=11:5></a> Of what value was that?<a name=11:6></a> -- they were no testimony.<a name=11:7></a> I would not make little of these dear women, because the other evangelists give us different views, but Mark gives us the view that is intended to bear upon us in regard to what he presents.<a name=11:8></a> Indeed when a crisis arises we are apt to be amazed and trembling, and anxious about this and that, and to say nothing because of fear.<a name=11:9></a> Of what good are we then?<a name=11:10></a> That is the position in Mark.<a name=11:11></a> But the ninth verse brings the Lord on the scene.<a name=11:12></a> He comes in and takes up things and leads to victory.<a name=11:13></a> The point in this chapter is whether I have <i>faith</i>.<a name=11:14></a> Without faith I am of little or no use at all.<a name=11:15></a> If I am not in active faith I am discrediting the things I speak about.<a name=11:16></a> I cannot speak aright except on the principle of faith.<a name=11:17></a> Better it was that they should say nothing when they were amazed and fearing.<a name=11:18></a>

		J.T.<a name=62:3></a> Quite.<a name=62:4></a> The Holy Spirit records that he remained certain days with the disciples and then preached in the synagogues that Jesus is the Son of God.<a name=62:5></a> In the ordinary version it says that Saul inquired of the Lord what he should do, but that part of verse 6 of <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9">Acts  9</a>does not appear in the original: not that Saul did not ask, but the Holy Spirit appears to have left it out at the outset, thus showing in greater relief the fact that he acted of himself in preaching in the synagogues.<a name=62:6></a> And then we are told that he went up to Jerusalem to make acquaintance with Peter, showing how wise he was in recognizing that particular vessel already in active service.<a name=62:7></a> It appears, too, that Peter took notice of the progress the testimony was making, for in raising up Aeneas he says, "Jesus Christ maketh thee whole: arise, and make thy bed", as if to say the order now is to learn to do things for oneself.<a name=62:8></a> Then he restores Tabitha from the dead and presents her alive.<a name=62:9></a> All that, I think, serves to enhance Paul's visit to Jerusalem to make acquaintance with Peter.<a name=62:10></a> The testimony would move on in that way in happy fellowship; but still he has to wait, and Barnabas finds him at Tarsus and brings him to Antioch, and he remains there for a year serving the saints with Barnabas.<a name=62:11></a> Then the Holy Spirit says, when they were ministering to the Lord, "Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them"; that is, the servants are now ready; the saints have had full opportunity to be acquainted with them and the Holy Spirit gives this charge.<a name=62:12></a> It was the sovereign act of the Spirit to call them out and send them forth.<a name=62:13></a> And so I think the apostle Paul may be taken as a representative levite.<a name=62:14></a> I rather think that Mark speaks of the subject from the standpoint of Paul's ministry.<a name=62:15></a> It is "The beginning of the gospel of Jesus

		These scriptures treat of <i>the man</i> and <i>the woman</i> and that is why I have read them, wishing to show the relative positions and functions of the sexes in the assembly; and not only to apply these scriptures in a literal sense, but also to enlarge a little on what is conveyed spiritually in the man and in the woman respectively.<a name=128:1></a> The first scripture is selected from a chapter which treats somewhat fully of the relative positions of man and woman, and it is not without signification that the chapter also introduces and develops the assembly in the exercise of its functions in a locality, which, rightly understood, makes room for Christ as the full representation of the man, as the assembly is the full representation of the woman; and makes room also for the universal position of the assembly as the one great thought and object of Christ in the current dispensation.<a name=128:2></a> The chapter in introducing the Lord's supper prefaces it by instruction that leads on to the apprehension of the Lord Jesus as Head of the assembly.<a name=128:3></a>

		In <a href="../bible/Judges.htm#4">Judges  4</a>we have a woman taking the lead in the service of God in relation to a man: Deborah being the woman, and Barak the man.<a name=129:3></a> In the New Translation of the Bible, we are told in a footnote, that Deborah is said to be "a woman prophetess".<a name=129:4></a> Of course, the word "prophetess" means that she is a woman who prophesied, but in the original the feminine idea is stressed.<a name=129:5></a> So that if circumstances amongst the people of God require a sister to take any kind of prominence in the testimony, she never loses her feminineness, she is always a woman; she never takes on the masculine character, for wherever that appears in a sister, you may be sure the flesh is active.<a name=129:6></a> If weak conditions require that a sister should become prominent, she never loses her sisterly character; she always has "power" on her head, as <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:10">1 Corinthians  11:10</a> teaches; and that goes forward into the assembly normally, she never loses her relative position and function, she is always herself.<a name=129:7></a>

		From these remarks you will see why I read the two verses in the first scripture, which say, "For man is not of woman, but woman of man.<a name=130:6></a> For also man was not created for the sake of the woman, but woman for the sake of the man".<a name=130:7></a> But then, it goes on, "However, neither is woman without man, nor man without woman, in the Lord.<a name=130:8></a> For as the woman is of the man, so also is the man by the woman, but all things of God".<a name=130:9></a> So that we have set out in the chapter a beautiful order of things.<a name=130:10></a> God is regarded as the supreme Head, an appellation first ascribed to Him by David.<a name=130:11></a> David says, "Jehovah .<a name=130:12></a>.<a name=130:13></a>.<a name=130:14></a> thou art exalted as Head above all", (<a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#29:11">1 Chronicles  29:11</a>).<a name=130:15></a> It awaited the Lord Jesus to come in to set out this wonderful truth, for He not only said things, but He exemplified them.<a name=130:16></a> One who contents himself with merely saying things will never be a model: if I <i>show</i> a thing, it is established in the mind.<a name=130:17></a> The Lord Jesus set out this great principle of God-headship, as I might call it, in His life here -- "The head of Christ is God", and "Christ is the head of every man, but woman's head is the man", "but all things of God".<a name=130:18></a>

		Aquila and Priscilla are mentioned three times together in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#18">Acts  18</a>.<a name=132:4></a> The idea of wisdom would be there; the first epistle to the Corinthians shows that the idea of divine wisdom was prominent in Paul's service there, and Priscilla would not fail to suggest that "The wisdom of women buildeth their house", (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#14:1">Proverbs  14:1</a>).<a name=132:5></a> Wisdom is a feminine word; the feminine idea in this sense leads to the assembly.<a name=132:6></a> "The wisdom of women buildeth their house; but folly plucketh it down with her hands".<a name=132:7></a> So that you can understand how that thought would be present, at least to the mind of Paul, as to Priscilla -- what a fine sister she was!<a name=132:8></a> I am speaking of her because of the way she is mentioned in these different references.<a name=132:9></a> Her name appears first as <i>often</i> as Aquila's does.<a name=132:10></a> You will find, "Aquila and Priscilla", and then "Priscilla and Aquila", and then you find "Aquila and Priscilla", and then again "Priscilla and Aquila"; is that accidental?<a name=132:11></a> No, it is educational: that is to call attention to what is <i>possible</i>, and what is possible should always be aimed at; it should never be regarded as impossible.<a name=132:12></a> If it were possible in these two, it is possible in any two, and it is possible in Christ and in the assembly as His body.<a name=132:13></a> So that we find these two, as I said, interchangeably having precedence one of the other.<a name=132:14></a> Not that Priscilla would ever <i>take</i> precedence of her husband: were we to enter their house -- and we are told that there was an assembly in their house -- that assembly would be adorned, as I may say, by the seemliness and the grace of this

		Then thirdly, there is the demonstration of judgment.<a name=201:10></a> How much could be written about that too if it were a mere matter of detail, but the Spirit of God is dealing in a compressed way, and dealing thus with the whole matter.<a name=201:11></a> So the demonstration of judgment is "because the prince of this world is judged".<a name=201:12></a> He is the author of sin; the personification of it, as I may say, is in him: "the devil sinneth from the beginning", (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:8">1 John  3:8</a>).<a name=201:13></a> It is not only that he sinned at the beginning, but he sins <i>from</i> the beginning.<a name=201:14></a> We may say that he can do nothing else.<a name=201:15></a> He has acquired a place as the prince of this world, but he is judged.<a name=201:16></a> It may be said that he is still in power, and so he is in a way, but what is stated here suggests to us great principles reached and established as demonstrated by the Spirit.<a name=201:17></a> The <i>execution</i> of the judgment is only a matter of time.<a name=201:18></a> So in our dealings with sin as in the assembly, the

	<div class="paragraph">
		When Jephthah had to fight the Ammonites he set the matter out fully; he showed how Israel had acquired their inheritance, and that the Ammonites' claim was unrighteous (<a href="../bible/Judges.htm#11">Judges  11</a>).<a name=202:3></a> If we can establish the point of righteousness, the right and wrong of a matter, it is morally settled.<a name=202:4></a> If we are not able to enforce it -- we may actually die for it, and thus we enforce it morally.<a name=202:5></a> That is really what came out in Jesus.<a name=202:6></a> The cross was the great crisis of all these issues, and although the Lord Jesus went down outwardly in death, all these great principles were established, and they cannot be overthrown.<a name=202:7></a>

		I go on to Exodus just briefly, so that we may see how the principle set out in the Spirit appeared as Israel crossed the Red Sea.<a name=203:4></a> Jehovah said to Moses, "Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.<a name=203:5></a> Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him".<a name=203:6></a> Now that is a passage, dear brethren, that bears on the subject before me in a very striking way.<a name=203:7></a> Not that the Angel is comparable with the Spirit.<a name=203:8></a> An angel is a creature, the Holy Spirit is a divine Person, and that in itself indicates the great difference between them, and between Israel and ourselves.<a name=203:9></a> Yet there was with Israel the principle of one there sent down from heaven.<a name=203:10></a> Moses and Aaron and Miriam led the people outwardly: God led them by the hand of Moses and Aaron, and Miriam also had part in this.<a name=203:11></a> God sent those three before them; they were the leaders, but this Angel was a type of the Spirit, ever present, always wakeful, always watching the camp of Israel.<a name=203:12></a> How well we may use the word "Comforter" in regard of the blessed Spirit!<a name=203:13></a> "Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep", (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#121:4">Psalm  121:4</a>).<a name=203:14></a> Moses slept, and so did Aaron and Miriam and Israel, but the Angel was ever awake.<a name=203:15></a> How comforting it must have been for faith to look at the tent of meeting as the camp rested, and see the cloud, the sure evidence of the divine presence.<a name=203:16></a> Jehovah was always there; angelically, we may say, but nevertheless really present.<a name=203:17></a> How precious is the thought!<a name=203:18></a> If one were to wake at night, as a godly Israelite might -- and there were

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=221:5></a> Yes, that enters into this side of the truth.<a name=221:6></a> According to the Lord's words, His own presence here corporeally could not be what the presence of the Holy Spirit is.<a name=221:7></a> The Holy Spirit has never become incarnate; the mode of His presence is in the saints and is universal, wherever the saints may be, distance having nothing to do with it.<a name=221:8></a> When we are together in assembly there is that in which He moves and in which He operates in a peculiar way, according to the principles that govern the position; that is, He operates saintward and Godward, just as the Lord did here.<a name=221:9></a> The Lord operated here manward -- or saintward -- and then He took up a Godward attitude amongst His own.<a name=221:10></a> All that is proper to the assembly is to be learnt from the Lord by teaching and example, but if the Spirit is to set an example before us now, He takes up one of the saints.<a name=221:11></a> He moves according to the teaching of the Lord, according to what He hears, and what came out in the life of the Lord here both before and after His death.<a name=221:12></a> What came out before His death enters into the <i>order</i> of the assembly, but what came out after He arose, during the forty days, has to do mainly with the assembly Godward, being the wholly spiritual side.<a name=221:13></a> I think the Holy Spirit moves according to the teaching and example of the Lord.<a name=221:14></a>

		and whilst the Lord is taking His place as Head, He would give full scope for what we have here, -- the love of God.<a name=224:1></a> The full bearing of the covenant in the assembly has the effect of setting the saints free; and I think scope should be given for that as we may discern it is the Lord, for He is the Mediator of the covenant; "the Lord is the Spirit", (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#3:17">2 Corinthians  3:17</a>).<a name=224:2></a> That is the Spirit which quickens, "not of letter, but of spirit.<a name=224:3></a> For the letter kills, but the Spirit quickens" (verse 6); and then, "the Lord is the Spirit, but where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty".<a name=224:4></a> Thus the saints are enlarged; there is then more room for the working out of what the assembly is Godward.<a name=224:5></a>

		The scripture in Corinthians indicates how we are to regard the people of God in any town or place in which they may be.<a name=279:1></a> They are to be regarded as God's husbandry, God's building; the former may apply and not the latter, whereas normally both ideas should apply or be manifest in any company of God's people.<a name=279:2></a> The husbandry is the fruit of sowing: the yield is for use; the scripture says, "The king himself is dependent upon the field", (<a href="../bible/Ecclesiastes.htm#5:9">Ecclesiastes  5:9</a>).<a name=279:3></a> God has in mind that in the sowing there should be a crop for Himself.<a name=279:4></a> The idea is that it is for use or consumption.<a name=279:5></a> I am speaking now of the figure itself; the building is a permanent idea, but it rightly accompanies the thought of husbandry; the two thoughts are aptly set in their position in <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#24:27">Proverbs  24:27</a>: "Prepare thy work without, and put thy field in order, and afterwards build thy house", so the idea of building is not to be detached from the field or husbandry, but nevertheless they are two distinct things.<a name=279:6></a> In the house there are liveable conditions, that in which there is scope for affection, it is therefore obvious that the two things run together.<a name=279:7></a> They do so in ordinary affairs -- we have the farm and the habitation, but the greater thought is the habitation: it is the sphere for the display of intelligence with which God has endowed man, and of affection, of family life.<a name=279:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that is what is stated, dear brethren, in this verse very briefly, and that it has an application to a company of christians in any town or city is of course obvious.<a name=279:9></a> What is to be noted primarily is that the husbandry and the building are God's, implying that man as such has no part in them.<a name=279:10></a> It has a negative bearing, for in truth there was very little ground for

		Now, having said all that about these verses, I want to say a little as to building, because that is what I have particularly in mind, and let no one here assume that it is something beyond him or her, because the principle of building is by love -- love edifies, and every true christian has love.<a name=281:5></a> Anyone who has no love is nothing at all spiritually, and, moreover, the apostle says, "If any one love not the Lord Jesus Christ let him be Anathema Maranatha", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#16:22">1 Corinthians  16:22</a>.<a name=281:6></a> He resents the idea of a non-lover of Christ having a place in the assembly and uses the strongest language against such.<a name=281:7></a> There may be those who have a little love for the Lord down in the bottom of their hearts, they are thus not non-lovers, but they are in a poor way -- their external position is very little different from a non-lover, something like the speaker in <a href="../bible/SongofSongs.htm#1:7">Song of Songs  1:7</a> who says, "why should I be as one veiled?<a name=281:8></a>" that is to say, a person whose <i>fidelity is questionable</i>.<a name=281:9></a> That was her idea at the first, and in seeking to find the Lord and to be in happy relations with Him, she was to seek out the footsteps of the flock, and resort to where they resorted.<a name=281:10></a> You do not want to be one of those who are questionable, you want it to be known to all that you are a lover of Christ.<a name=281:11></a> Song of Songs greatly helps us in this.<a name=281:12></a> The Song shows how one may be devoid of love externally like the "little

		That is what the Lord Himself said to the apostles, so as to prevent self-satisfaction and pride; our appraisement must be in the light of the divine standard of workmanship, and as one measures one's work with that standard it is very humiliating; you may be sure of that, although it may be profitable in measure.<a name=298:7></a> It is thus wholesome to inquire of God in the morning and make a review in the evening as to the <i>work</i>.<a name=298:8></a> How does it compare with the general scheme of God?<a name=298:9></a> for we have in this passage in Corinthians the general idea conveyed, the plan of the building committed to Paul.<a name=298:10></a> The wise architect laid the foundation, the whole scheme was there and now the workers were to proceed, and as he said, let each take heed how he builds thereon, so that one is to review one's bit and see how it compares with the general scheme, or whether it is wood, hay or stubble, which are worse than useless and have to be removed.<a name=298:11></a>

		By the Lord's help, I hope to speak on the thought of holiness, and holiness in the actual service of the Lord in His testimony.<a name=305:1></a> I begin with <a href="../bible/John.htm#6:70">John  6:70</a>, because the Lord brings in the twelve formally there, in saying, "Have not I chosen you the twelve?<a name=305:2></a>" The official side of the apostles is but little noticed in John, but it is noticed here under the numeral twelve; the Spirit giving it a place in view of Peter's confession -- Peter's acknowledgement that Christ was "the holy one of God" The thought, however, of the twelve is immediately reduced in its official value, by the fact that one is said to have been "a devil".<a name=305:3></a> I say reduced in its official value, because John has in mind the time when official distinction should have little or no place; the time when that which had that place would prove false: that is to say, he had in view our own time.<a name=305:4></a> Whilst the official side is weakened by the fact that one of the twelve was "a devil", the service by the confession of the leading apostle, that is Peter, would be thereby rather enhanced.<a name=305:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The idea of holiness appearing here, in the expression "the holy one of God", implies that the service should not be marred but rather enhanced; the very fact of one being a devil making it more imperative that there should be holiness in the service.<a name=305:6></a> That the Master is the "holy one of God" is asserted, and hence we look for holiness in the servant.<a name=305:7></a> I believe that the thought of "the twelve" is noticed to bring this feature within the knowledge of the disciples, for Peter was not speaking for himself alone: he was speaking for all.<a name=305:8></a> He says, "we have believed and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is an important matter to have things certified by experience.<a name=306:3></a> John himself says, later, "we know that the Son of God has come", it was a fixed matter in their knowledge; and not only has He come, but He "has given us an understanding that we should know him that is true" We know Him as <i>true</i> -- another feature of our Lord that is to enter into service.<a name=306:4></a> He is <i>the true</i> one; and John says, "we are in him that is true, in his Son Jesus Christ" -- and then he finishes with this "He is the true God and eternal life", (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:20">1 John  5:20</a>).<a name=306:5></a> How much is condensed into that statement!<a name=306:6></a> but it is a statement of fixed knowledge amongst the saints.<a name=306:7></a> So here Peter says, ".<a name=306:8></a>.<a name=306:9></a>.<a name=306:10></a> we have believed and known that thou art the holy one of God".<a name=306:11></a> The element of holiness is to be henceforward amongst the saints.<a name=306:12></a> The nominal service of God has become a very wide matter; the apostle Paul says, "For if ye should have ten thousand instructors .<a name=306:13></a>.<a name=306:14></a>.<a name=306:15></a>" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#4:15">1 Corinthians  4:15</a>): and there are as many and even more in christendom now.<a name=306:16></a> "Ten thousand instructors in Christ" but then it is a question of the quality of the instruction -- whether the element of holiness enters into their service.<a name=306:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Peter, alluding to the twelve, said, "we have believed and known that thou art the holy one of God".<a name=306:18></a> At no time henceforth when Peter stood up to serve, would he forget that.<a name=306:19></a> The Spirit of God would secure him in relation to that.<a name=306:20></a> He had already confessed Jesus to be "the Christ, the Son of the living God" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:16">Matthew  16:16</a>).<a name=306:21></a> He had it by revelation: he had the truth of the Lord's Person in a unique way; but he held it as a treasure in a treasury.<a name=306:22></a> He never speaks of Christ as the Son of God in his preaching as far as is recorded.<a name=306:23></a> You may inquire why I mention that.<a name=306:24></a> It may even be suggested to you that I am belittling the great fact of the sonship of Christ in saying that Peter did not

	<div class="paragraph">
		The announcement that Jesus is the Son of God awaited another vessel.<a name=307:10></a> It is as if the Lord would say, Peter you have received this revelation from the Father; it is to be in your mind as a treasure in a treasury; you are to be enriched by it in your soul, and you are by it constituted a stone in the building, but when My time comes, I shall bring forward a vessel peculiarly fitted, to <i>announce</i> Me as the Son of God: -- and that servant was Paul.<a name=307:11></a> He was fitted in like manner, for he says, "God, who set me apart .<a name=307:12></a>.<a name=307:13></a>.<a name=307:14></a> and called me by his grace, was pleased to reveal his Son in me, that I may announce him as glad tidings among the nations", (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#1:15">Galatians  1:15</a>,16).<a name=307:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we have him who is fitted for the service: what was revealed in him he is to announce, "as glad tidings among the nations" -- and this he did.<a name=307:16></a> His first preaching was that Jesus is the Son of God.<a name=307:17></a> He made no delay.<a name=307:18></a> The great testimony must be rendered, and he rendered it.<a name=307:19></a> But then what a power the revelation of the Father would be in Peter's soul as he stood up in Jerusalem, to know that the Messiah was no less than the Son of God -- "the Son of the living God"; yea, that He was no less than God Himself!<a name=307:20></a> -- "over all, God blessed for ever" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#9:5">Romans  9:5</a>).<a name=307:21></a> What a power that would be in the soul of Peter, in his service!<a name=307:22></a> But then, what also enhanced his service was this knowledge, that he and his fellow-servants,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I begin with this one verse, dear brethren, as bringing out the idea of the Lord's commandment.<a name=333:1></a> The importance of a divine commandment, especially as embracing many in detail, has been long observed and felt, and its importance was never greater; for the present period is peculiarly marked by disobedience, whether it be to the authorities divinely ordained, or parent or masters or what is set in the assembly; disregard of commandment and divine authority is prevalent everywhere.<a name=333:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am speaking now in general terms, hoping to come to those in whom there is respect for the Lord's commandment.<a name=333:3></a> It is a written commandment here; it stands whether it is observed or otherwise.<a name=333:4></a> We have before us the writer, as well as the commandment through him; one who has a place not only by faithfulness, but by divine appointment in a special way; one to whom the ministry of the mystery of the assembly was committed, to complete the word of God.<a name=333:5></a> God lays great stress on the place of this servant, and this very verse emphasizes it, in that in it he says, "the things that I write to you, .<a name=333:6></a>.<a name=333:7></a>.<a name=333:8></a> it is the Lord's commandment".<a name=333:9></a> I believe that is the proper rendering, it is one great idea, "<i>it</i> is the Lord's commandment".<a name=333:10></a> It is one great idea of commandment, and it is a test to all pretension to gift or spirituality.<a name=333:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to show, dear brethren, that commandment implies fixity from the divine side, and is therefore a guarantee that things are to stand, a guarantee for faith.<a name=333:12></a> Our position here today is a testimony that the will of God stands; that we can meet thus, no man forbidding us, when in earlier days such a meeting would be proscribed.<a name=333:13></a> A commandment lies behind

		this, something maintained divinely.<a name=334:1></a> And so, to trace the idea a little way, we have it set out very early, especially in that well-known passage in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#33:9">Psalm  33:9</a>, referring to the creation, "he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast".<a name=334:2></a> There was intelligence in the speaking, faith understanding that "the worlds were framed by the word of God", (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:3">Hebrews  11:3</a>).<a name=334:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I hope to show that this applies in a moral sense, too: "it stood fast", there was fixity, a most important point to bear in mind in looking through the Scriptures, for all were written for us.<a name=334:4></a> The idea of fixity based on the commandment runs through, and, as I said before, fits into our very meeting today, "he commanded, and it stood fast".<a name=334:5></a> Then, lest there might be anxiety as to material things -- the waters are placed under a decree.<a name=334:6></a> Waters in the creation can be easily moved, God can call upon them, if needs be, as He did in a large way to effect the deluge, when "the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened", (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#7:11">Genesis  7:11</a>).<a name=334:7></a> Possibly the antediluvians never thought of God's resources in this way.<a name=334:8></a> According to His remarks to Job, God had set bars and doors to circumvent the movement of the waters, but they were available for His use (<a href="../bible/Job.htm#38:10">Job  38:10</a>).<a name=334:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The antediluvians doubtless had not reckoned on such resources, such movable material, an element that God could call upon in a large way for retributive and for cleansing purposes.<a name=334:10></a> But then He had them under control, and still has them thus.<a name=334:11></a> He may use them, but it is a question of His will, and that applies at the present time -- "Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed", (<a href="../bible/Job.htm#38:11">Job  38:11</a>).<a name=334:12></a> The underworld, as we speak of it, may seem to lift up its head, and it has done so even in modern times; what, in one sense, is prefigured by the waters may be acted upon, and will be.<a name=334:13></a> We are touching the fringe of the period in which the waves

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We do well to face these things, dear brethren, because they are facing us.<a name=335:3></a> But then, as I said, there is security, and we may shelter under the commandment -- the decree.<a name=335:4></a> Wisdom was present as the decree was imposed according to <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#8:29">Proverbs  8:29</a>.<a name=335:5></a> Wisdom says "when he imposed on the sea his decree that the waters should not pass his commandment .<a name=335:6></a>.<a name=335:7></a>.<a name=335:8></a> then I was by him".<a name=335:9></a> It is a question of God's power to impose His will on what seems to be most powerful.<a name=335:10></a> We are to nestle under this in regard to current conditions.<a name=335:11></a> Prayer enters into that too, for believers are to be conversant with these things: the Scriptures are written for us, and if we read Scripture and become sympathetic with God, we will look to Him as to things.<a name=335:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, coming to Adam, there was also testimony to the divine commandment in the tree of knowledge of good and evil.<a name=335:13></a> That was intended to govern Adam in innocency, but he lost his innocency and it is never regained: innocency is not a thing that is regained.<a name=335:14></a> The new man is "created in righteousness and true holiness" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:24">Ephesians  4:24</a>), it is not said that the new man is created in innocency.<a name=335:15></a> Righteousness and holiness belong to a much greater order of man than Adam, involving what will stand up intelligently against all that is against God in this world.<a name=335:16></a> God introduced the thought immediately sin came in; the idea of righteousness is brought out; and notwithstanding the presence of sin through Adam and Eve, human conditions were fixed in a general way by commandment, through what was imposed on the serpent, and on the woman, and on the man -- that was the order.<a name=335:17></a> God imposed certain

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It seems an extraordinary thing that a murderer should come under the protection of God, but "where sin abounded grace has overabounded", (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:20">Romans  5:20</a>).<a name=336:2></a> It is the Jew, typified in Cain, protected to the present moment: he is around us, in the towns and cities with which we have to do.<a name=336:3></a> The Lord's word stands unfailingly, "This generation will not have passed away until all these things shall have taken place", (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#24:34">Matthew  24:34</a>).<a name=336:4></a> The Jew stands, the generation is the same today as it was then.<a name=336:5></a> All these things come down to us, they are round about us, all fixed by the divine commandment; evil can go just so far, and no further.<a name=336:6></a> Faith nestles under this; the commandment of God must be in our favour surely, if it shelter the Jew.<a name=336:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is how matters stood in the antediluvian world, and these things run right through -- taken up and added to after the deluge in a most interesting way, for we are in the post-diluvian world; that which then was is said to have perished, we are in the world that now is, and there is another one to come.<a name=336:8></a> The present world dates from the deluge, but it is full of the same things and others added, especially in regard of the nations.<a name=336:9></a> International issues are the outstanding feature of the time, and we must not disregard them, for they enter into the will of God.<a name=336:10></a> Indeed the apostle Paul said to the Athenians at Mars' hill, those who above other people would be conversant with mundane affairs, that God "has made of one blood every nation of men to dwell upon the whole face of the earth, having determined ordained times and the boundaries of their dwelling", (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#17:26">Acts  17:26</a>).<a name=336:11></a> In whatever direction we look, there it is, God has set the bounds and they cannot be altered: in other words, God is in all these things, as

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How different everything becomes as we look at it thus; God entering into all these things in a limiting way by His commandment.<a name=337:2></a> Take the current agricultural situation, for instance, how prolific the earth is -- is that not of God?<a name=337:3></a> It is; that fact enters into the worship of God's people.<a name=337:4></a> "While the earth remaineth", He says to Noah, "seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease", (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#8:22">Genesis  8:22</a>).<a name=337:5></a> It is very striking how the goodness of God in the fulness of the earth stands over against the futility of human legislation and administration.<a name=337:6></a> God is still there to be worshipped as the Creator.<a name=337:7></a> God would enlarge us as to these things, that we might worship Him intelligently as enjoying His benefits, seeing His greatness; for "the invisible things of him are perceived, being apprehended by the mind through the things that are made" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#1:20">Romans  1:20</a>), showing that by the renewed mind, the christian is brought into these things, perceiving in this way "both his eternal power and divinity".<a name=337:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then another thing in regard to the nations is that in ordering them, it was in relation to the children of Israel, His own people: all these orderings and fixities have in view the comfort, the prosperity and growth, of the people of God.<a name=337:9></a> We are set in what seems to be overwhelming; if for a moment God's hand were lifted, it would be so, and yet the people of God stand in the midst of it unperturbed; that is to say, where <i>faith</i> exists.<a name=337:10></a> All these bounds are set in relation to the people of God, according to <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#33">Deuteronomy  33</a>-- the love of God entering into that book in a peculiar way: "Yea, he loved the people", it is said (verse 3).<a name=337:11></a> So that we are restful in regard to current matters by the knowledge of the commandment of God.<a name=337:12></a>

		What are we going to make of it?<a name=338:1></a> Elsewhere the Lord says, "He that has my commandments and keeps them, he it is that loves me", (<a href="../bible/John.htm#14:21">John  14:21</a>).<a name=338:2></a> If these things are disregarded abroad, the Lord would appeal to us that the one that is written to us, this particular one in this letter to the Corinthians, should be looked into most carefully and adhered to sedulously.<a name=338:3></a> There is enjoyment in it, but above all, we honour Him whose it is -- "it is the <i>Lord's</i> commandment".<a name=338:4></a> One is reminded of Himself as Man here on earth, and He leads the way in this, as in all else: He loved the law, it was in His heart.<a name=338:5></a> What a testimony He was here!<a name=338:6></a> and how delightful to heaven He was in that relation.<a name=338:7></a> He "magnified" it too, for God makes a point of that, that His law must stand; and not only stand, but be honoured.<a name=338:8></a> "He will magnify the law, and make it honourable", (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#42:21">Isaiah  42:21</a>).<a name=338:9></a> How important, therefore, if we love God, if we love the Lord Jesus, that this great commandment, the first letter to the Corinthians, should not only <i>stand</i> in regard to ourselves, but be made honourable.<a name=338:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What has been the case even in the history of persons who separated nominally from the great religious systems many years ago?<a name=338:11></a> Many independent bodies have been formed, and this commandment has dropped out of view; and it remains out of view so far as many are concerned.<a name=338:12></a> I am not here to accuse, but it is a solemn fact.<a name=338:13></a> What does heaven think of that?<a name=338:14></a> There may be much activity, but what must heaven think when the commandment is not magnified and made honourable?<a name=338:15></a> -- not even kept?<a name=338:16></a> We may well listen to the Lord saying, "it shall not be so among you".<a name=338:17></a> Let us take it to heart; He is greatly concerned about this matter.<a name=338:18></a> I do not, of course, limit the idea of commandment to this epistle, but this epistle relates to the assembly in its public character here, and how important therefore that it should have its place, not only in word but in fact; that we may be able to prove

		Well, it is here in chapters 11 to 14 inclusive, but particularly in chapters 12 to 14.<a name=339:3></a> Chapter 11 deals with the Lord's supper; the Lord has helped us as to that, and is helping us.<a name=339:4></a> The apostle, in that chapter, speaks about the directions he had given the Corinthians, which they had kept, and he was now giving them others; and then he adds that other things that needed to be set in order, he would deal with when he arrived.<a name=339:5></a> But then the question of gift comes up, the question of ministry; and it is a very important matter just now.<a name=339:6></a> The apostle, indeed, had persons who professed to minister in his mind, persons who would prophesy.<a name=339:7></a> Certain ones at Corinth had entered the lists with the great apostle, as rivals to him.<a name=339:8></a> What folly!<a name=339:9></a> But it was there, rivalry in the ministry; and what goes with that is partisanship, and what follows on that is metropolitanism.<a name=339:10></a> So he says, "Did the word of God go out from you?<a name=339:11></a>" Had it been so, it would have meant that Corinth was to be a metropolitan centre, as Jerusalem had been.<a name=339:12></a> Jerusalem is the only city entering into christianity that was once rightly metropolitan, and it has passed away long ago, not to be revived in relation to christianity.<a name=339:13></a> It was of God for the moment but God would never repeat that amongst the nations, though the assumption to it has been shamefully attempted in Rome, and in other centres, too.<a name=339:14></a> The rival element at Corinth would have had it so.<a name=339:15></a> "Did the word of God go out from you?<a name=339:16></a>" the apostle says.<a name=339:17></a> It did not; there is no evidence of it.<a name=339:18></a> It went out from Thessalonica, from a young assembly, "it sounded out", but there was no pretence to rivalry with Paul in Thessalonica.<a name=339:19></a> There cannot be the proclamation according to God where rivalry exists.<a name=339:20></a>

		Sometimes we find among the brethren radical thoughts, levelling everything down, but in he assembly there is levelling <i>down</i> and levelling <i>up</i>: the brother of low degree is to glory in his elevation and the rich in his humiliation (<a href="../bible/James.htm#1:9">James  1:9</a> - 10).<a name=353:6></a> This brings all to one level in a spiritual sense, and so love would have it.<a name=353:7></a> But this is no suggestion of radicalism or Bolshevism, which is abhorrent to the mind of God.<a name=353:8></a> David here is speaking about rank.<a name=353:9></a> There are angels and there are archangels, and so amongst the people of God there is rank, there are degrees.<a name=353:10></a> We must leave that with God.<a name=353:11></a> The Lord Jesus, in speaking to the mother of Zebedee's children, says that the positions she asked for her sons were not His to give; they were for those for whom His Father prepared them.<a name=353:12></a> He indicated that the Father is the sovereign regulator of all these matters.<a name=353:13></a> David here says, "thou .<a name=353:14></a>.<a name=353:15></a>.<a name=353:16></a> hast regarded me according to the rank of a man of high degree" -- and that is the impression you get as you enter into the holiest.<a name=353:17></a> You see the glories of Jesus.<a name=353:18></a> He has passed through the heavens, according to Hebrews.<a name=353:19></a> There is nobody with a rank like that.<a name=353:20></a> He has that pre-eminence, but we go into heaven, too; we have the rank of sons.<a name=353:21></a> We belong, according to this same epistle to the Hebrews, to the assembly of the firstborn.<a name=353:22></a> That is a peculiar kind of rank.<a name=353:23></a> There is no rank like that even in this country, notwithstanding the great skill they show in creating titles; there is no set of nobility of whom everyone can be said to be a firstborn.<a name=353:24></a> That is the rank that belongs to us; so that each of us can say, God regards me as a man of high degree.<a name=353:25></a> Would that we took it in by the Spirit!<a name=353:26></a> God surely is entitled to have His nobility.<a name=353:27></a> He has His angels and His archangels; and so with the rank of every family in

		Finally, the passage in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#73">Psalm  73</a>shows how entrance into the sanctuary helps us as regards our public relations It is the first psalm of the third book, as you will know; it is a psalm of Asaph and comes in immediately following the statement that David's prayers are ended.<a name=354:8></a> That is, it is a period spiritually when, as we might say, everything is well, for the Lord Jesus, the true Solomon of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#72">Psalm  72</a>, is crowned in heaven.<a name=354:9></a> Millennial glory and blessedness are anticipated, as secured through Him.<a name=354:10></a> This applies now as to the assembly; everything will be well; the Lord Jesus, the true Solomon, is enthroned and His throne is universal.<a name=354:11></a> So we can say anticipatively that our prayers are ended.<a name=354:12></a> Even as to Solomon, David knew that with him on the throne things would be well; he handed over to him Joab, and Shimei, knowing that in his wisdom Solomon would deal with them and indeed the whole kingdom according to righteousness and truth.<a name=354:13></a> For faith now the Lord Jesus has power and knows how to deal with everything in heaven and on earth; He is serving thus in relation to the assembly now, and presently He will clear away all evil and establish righteousness and peace universally.<a name=354:14></a>

		I cannot say any more.<a name=356:2></a> The psalm has often been spoken of and I commend it to you so that you may not be distressed about current public conditions.<a name=356:3></a> As we go inside we see what is before God and we learn that these conditions will all come to an end.<a name=356:4></a> The word is "sanctuaries"; it is plural, which seems to intensify the thought.<a name=356:5></a> There is no sanctuary beyond you.<a name=356:6></a> The very inner one you can go into.<a name=356:7></a> Then Asaph goes on to tell how God will deal with the evil that troubled him; He will bring everything into accord with what is in the sanctuary.<a name=356:8></a> That applies to external conditions that may harass us, even among the people of God; as we go inside all is clear.<a name=356:9></a> There is liberty to go in and there is the way in.<a name=356:10></a> It is a matter of holiness, of a pure heart, as I said.<a name=356:11></a>

		In Ephesians, we both have access through Christ by one Spirit to the Father; Hebrews gives us the way in, involving <i>things</i>, that is, the death of Christ, but Ephesians is like <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:6">John  14:6</a> where the Lord Jesus says, "I am the way".<a name=356:12></a> It is a question of the Person there.<a name=356:13></a> "Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip?<a name=356:14></a> he that hath seen me hath seen the Father" (verse 9).<a name=356:15></a> So He says, "<i>I</i> am the way, and the truth, and the life".<a name=356:16></a> That is in accord with Ephesians, so that in Ephesians it says we have access through Christ by one Spirit to the Father.<a name=356:17></a> That is how I understand the highest thought of the subject that I am speaking of.<a name=356:18></a> Approach to Persons is made available.<a name=356:19></a> We have the holy Person of the Son and the Holy Spirit available to us, so that we might draw near to the Father to worship Him in spirit and in truth.<a name=356:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have been thinking, dear brethren, of divine need, and of how it may be met.<a name=358:1></a> In speaking of divine need I am bearing in mind that it can only be met in Christ -- for in no other can there be any answer to the requirements of God.<a name=358:2></a> You will remember that at the baptism of our Lord Jesus the Father opened the heavens and said, "This is my beloved Son in whom I have found my delight" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#3:17">Matthew  3:17</a>); it does not say "<i>all</i> my delight", leaving an opening, as I apprehend, for the expansion of what was in Christ, for He is to fill all things, and it is in a universe filled with Christ that every divine desire and requirement is met.<a name=358:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My thought now is to show that God is operating for the extension of what is in Christ, in the sense in which Christ comes under God's eye <i>now</i> in the time of His rejection; in the time of His strenuous service; in the time of the maintenance of this wonderful period, in which it is said, "of his fulness <i>we</i> all have received, and grace upon grace", (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:16">John  1:16</a>).<a name=358:4></a> That is, one wave of grace after another coming out without limit.<a name=358:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Bearing this in mind, I would also bring before you the variety of the features of Christ.<a name=358:6></a> The city in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21">Revelation  21</a>has twelve gates, three facing each direction of the compass.<a name=358:7></a> These refer to special features.<a name=358:8></a> What relates to the north, is necessarily marked by a particular feature of Christ; certain things have to be met in that direction.<a name=358:9></a> There is the west, the east, and the south; each has its feature; each point has its own peculiar exigencies to be met.<a name=358:10></a> There will be nothing in the coming world that will not be perfectly met according to God, His glory

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now all that is in the making <i>here</i> in this city, and in every city where the people of God are.<a name=359:3></a> It lends wonderful lustre to the time in which we are, that these great features are in the making in us, having shone in Christ as narrated in the gospels.<a name=359:4></a> Each of the four narratives has its special spiritual intent; and so you find this particular incident of the colt in all of them, and I hope you will see that the need expressed in each narrative, has in view its own particular setting, according to the gospel in which it is found.<a name=359:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The features seen in all four gospels necessarily apply to the colt, that is, to each believer.<a name=359:6></a> The divine intent is to make each of us relatively four-sided like Christ.<a name=359:7></a> One would seek to be as ready to look towards the north, and face all the rigour of it, as to enjoy all the privileges of the south with its warmth.<a name=359:8></a> The west too, suggests the despondency that marks the world at the present time, the despairing relinquishment of cherished hopes.<a name=359:9></a> One would seek to be able to look in that direction and lift up one's head without a tremor or doubt, that the sun that seems to set will soon arise.<a name=359:10></a> Then again to look toward the east, to the sun-rising, full of hope, looking in that direction soberly, but with assurance that "the coming of the Lord draweth nigh".<a name=359:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, to begin with <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#19">Luke  19</a>; especially do I refer to our young brothers and sisters, and would say to each in the language of the evangelist, "the Lord has need of it".<a name=359:12></a> But if He has need of you, He has need of you on His own terms, not on yours.<a name=359:13></a> In referring to Luke, I had in mind the great need of priesthood, for that is the point of view there.<a name=359:14></a> You may be sure evangelical sympathy goes with the priesthood, and the patience and sympathy with

	<div class="paragraph">
		the brethren too, but priesthood is what this gospel has in view.<a name=360:1></a> It is the gospel of prayer.<a name=360:2></a> Let no young believer assume for a moment, that priesthood belongs to the elder brethren alone; it does belong to them, but it belongs to you also if you are a believer and have the Spirit.<a name=360:3></a> This gospel contemplates great anxiety as to you on the part of those who seek you; hence in Luke we find the Lord often in prayer -- something like ten times -- and on one occasion for a whole night.<a name=360:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before the Lord selected His apostles according to this evangelist, He spent a night in prayer (chapter 6:12), and "when it was day", that is, when the full light shone, "he called his disciples".<a name=360:5></a> He chose them when they could be seen.<a name=360:6></a> It is an immense gain to acquire ability to see things as they are, for nothing is of any value for the divine requirements, but what is the result of the work of God.<a name=360:7></a> Other things may blind and deceive us, so that we do not see things as they <i>are</i>.<a name=360:8></a> All this enters into the Lord's selection of the colt.<a name=360:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So in Luke, the Lord is ascending to Jerusalem, that is to say as having in view the divine centre.<a name=360:10></a> There is a group of localities here: Bethphage, Bethany and the mount of Olives.<a name=360:11></a> All these places have a spiritual significance as the environment in which the person may be, whom the Lord <i>needs</i>.<a name=360:12></a> It is an excellent environment.<a name=360:13></a> The Lord gives us every advantage.<a name=360:14></a> There is an advantage in Bethany.<a name=360:15></a> Think of the memories of Bethany, and Bethphage, and the mount of Olives, the latter alluding to divine provision in the Spirit!<a name=360:16></a> And Jerusalem itself, meaning so much spiritually, -- "the city of the great King" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#5:35">Matthew  5:35</a>).<a name=360:17></a> He is ascending to it in Luke.<a name=360:18></a> You are not being called to anything degrading or levelling according to man.<a name=360:19></a> He is going <i>up</i> to it, and as in that way He is seeking to have His needs met.<a name=360:20></a> How touching that is!<a name=360:21></a> He has need of <i>you</i>.<a name=360:22></a> So He sends two of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		His disciples, and He tells them what to do.<a name=361:1></a> As I said, Luke has priesthood in mind.<a name=361:2></a> The Lord has need of you in this sense; He has need of priests, and priests must have suitable clothes; hence you find much made of the clothes, but only those of the disciples here.<a name=361:3></a> This evangelist ends with the idea of being "clothed with power from on high" (chapter 24:49).<a name=361:4></a> We are in the presence of great moral elevation, what is "from on high".<a name=361:5></a> We are lifted out of the level of man's way and of man's priesthoods.<a name=361:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The two disciples go and find the ass, and we learn that it has "masters".<a name=361:7></a> Luke only mentions that fact.<a name=361:8></a> It is a very important matter that someone owned him, in the sense of having <i>authority</i> over him.<a name=361:9></a> How important for a young believer!<a name=361:10></a> It may be that some of us are not accustomed to admit ownership on the part of those immediate to us.<a name=361:11></a> The masters inquired why they loosed the colt.<a name=361:12></a> There was no hostility, but right-mindedness, for it was surely right to inquire as to this interference.<a name=361:13></a> But what an interference!<a name=361:14></a> It was by the authority of the messengers of Jesus.<a name=361:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This leads me to the two disciples, and where the brethren are in regard to them, so as to be thus used at any time.<a name=361:16></a> If there be no confidence between meetings, there can be no such service as this in a general way.<a name=361:17></a> While the understanding of local responsibility is most important, yet general confidence is essential for this service.<a name=361:18></a> The principle is, that the Lord has needs, and He would graciously use us to satisfy them.<a name=361:19></a> In each of the synoptic gospels we have two disciples sent, none at all in John, as I hope to show, for the Lord will ever remind us that He is not dependent wholly upon us.<a name=361:20></a> He finds the ass Himself in John.<a name=361:21></a> Let us be warned about that.<a name=361:22></a> If we are not available the Lord will see that the needed service is rendered.<a name=361:23></a>

		The next day, we are told, John stood.<a name=394:6></a> It was his time to stand, not that he did not stand earlier awaiting His showing to Israel, but spiritually it was his time to stand now that the Son of God had appeared.<a name=394:7></a> In John's gospel, it will be known to most of us, the Lord did not wait for John to be cast into prison before undertaking His own personal service.<a name=394:8></a> He served before that.<a name=394:9></a> That is to say, He served in the right of His Person, in the liberty that was proper to Him as the Son of God; not bound by ordinary levitical rule.<a name=394:10></a> He was the Son of God, and so, I may say, John ceases; he is standing, for the greater had now come on the scene, and Jesus is seen walking.<a name=394:11></a> As thus moving, John looked upon Him.<a name=394:12></a> He looked upon Him now with intelligence; with an intelligence that he could not have had until he saw the Spirit descending and remaining upon Him, and in his intelligence he was full of holy admiration.<a name=394:13></a> That gives the clue, dear brethren, to the understanding of this wonderful gospel by John.<a name=394:14></a> It is for persons capable of being affected, of being impressed; persons who can spiritually admire.<a name=394:15></a> It is a question of a Person, the Son of God.<a name=394:16></a> So that the first mention of Him in this respect is in verse 14 of chapter 1, "we have contemplated his glory", says the writer, "a glory as of an only-begotten with a father".<a name=394:17></a> He came within their range in that delightful relation, so that their hearts might be raptured, and they were.<a name=394:18></a> It was long after that John wrote, "we have contemplated his glory".<a name=394:19></a>

		Now another illustration in John's gospel, of the passage in the epistle, is the woman of Samaria, a well-known figure, one of the best, thank God!<a name=395:9></a> I refer to it only because of the intelligence she reached in her conversation with the Lord.<a name=395:10></a> The conversation was begun by Him, but she joined in it, most ignorantly at first, thinking only in a material way, which is characteristic of most of us, and alas, for a long time after we are converted.<a name=395:11></a> No one can understand John's gospel who thinks materially.<a name=395:12></a> God is a Spirit.<a name=395:13></a> We have to think spiritually.<a name=395:14></a> This woman began to think spiritually before she left the Lord.<a name=395:15></a> That ought to be the effect of every meeting of the saints, that we think more spiritually.<a name=395:16></a> She left her water pot; that is to say, she had done in that sense with the material; she understood that she was a vessel of living water.<a name=395:17></a>

		The next great illustration of intelligence that I would bring forward is Mary of Bethany.<a name=395:18></a> The man in chapter 9, whose eyes had been opened, may be cited, but I just touch on the more salient illustrations of intelligence.<a name=395:19></a> Mary of Bethany is a striking one.<a name=395:20></a> That is to say, her intelligence rises beyond the mere thought of the vessel, for the ointment was not said

		Now the next great illustration that I would bring forward is Mary Magdalene in chapter 20, so as to bring out and amplify John's statement that, "we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us an understanding that we should know him that is true; and we are in him that is true" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:20">1 John  5:20</a>).<a name=396:18></a> She is the acme of the subject before us.<a name=396:19></a> She began with a measure of activity -- not Martha-like, who had the energy without the intelligence -- and it is in Mary that we get the combination of which I have been

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I may say here that the energy of life, in the divine order, precedes intelligence.<a name=397:12></a> They run together, as it is in ordinary things, with children, but I refer particularly to the first chapter of Genesis.<a name=397:13></a> Life is seen on the third day, vegetable life, in connection with which we cannot speak of intelligence, but it is nevertheless life.<a name=397:14></a> The earth was to bring forth.<a name=397:15></a> There was the energy of life.<a name=397:16></a> Then on the fifth day you have living creatures, living souls; and on the sixth day you have man, that is intelligence.<a name=397:17></a> The order, therefore, is life first and then the development of intelligence, and any other order in us is sure to be damaging, in fact, disastrous.<a name=397:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		To aim at intelligence without suitable balance of affection in the energy of life will end disastrously.<a name=397:19></a> There must be balance.<a name=397:20></a> That is how the matter stands in John.<a name=397:21></a> So that Mary Magdalene has the love and the energy and so becomes a leader in it.<a name=397:22></a> It is a most interesting matter that she should be a leader, in fact, she actually led Peter and John!<a name=397:23></a> I am sure

		I pass on now to be as brief as possible.<a name=398:12></a> As possessing the energy of life, and affection, she gained intelligence far beyond what Peter and John acquired.<a name=398:13></a> She got an understanding from Christ.<a name=398:14></a> I would urge that on everyone here.<a name=398:15></a> He "has given us an understanding" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:20">1 John  5:20</a>).<a name=398:16></a> It is not as in Luke, the opening of our understandings that we might understand the Scriptures.<a name=398:17></a> It is the gift of an understanding; it is not development, but a gift.<a name=398:18></a> He "has given us an understanding".<a name=398:19></a> He is the Son of God.<a name=398:20></a> He said to Mary, "Touch me not, for I have not yet ascended to my Father".<a name=398:21></a> What intelligence is bound up with that remark, for her to meditate upon, but He says, "go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#20:17">John  20:17</a>).<a name=398:22></a> Now she knew more than all the apostles; she has what they had not; she has an understanding and she is perfectly in keeping with it.<a name=398:23></a> It says that she went and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord and that He had told her these things.<a name=398:24></a> What

		To further illustrate this I go on to the chapters in Revelation; they are prophetic chapters; God is entering on a new relation, for the assembly period is over.<a name=399:16></a> What is presented is what shall be after that period on earth, but not without the assembly.<a name=399:17></a> No activities of God in the future, I may say, disregard the assembly.<a name=399:18></a> So here it is, but included in the four and twenty elders, a symbolic number, that is to say, persons who have intelligence, but not simply intelligence acquired as the result, as I may say, of reading, or even of instruction, but from experience; intelligence acquired by experience.<a name=399:19></a> They are elders.<a name=399:20></a> The word is symbolical; it denotes experience with God.<a name=399:21></a> Indeed the Lord Himself is symbolically presented to us in this very guise in

		The twenty-four elders are on twenty-four thrones, clothed with white garments and they have golden crowns; all these are symbolic things.<a name=400:10></a> The throne alludes to God resuming His relations with the creation -- a very important matter for us.<a name=400:11></a> It refers back to the ninth chapter of Genesis, not the first; it refers back to God having entered into covenant with man and the beast of the field and the earth itself, and now the rainbow is round about this great throne, and the elders understand; they are sitting round and they cast their crowns before Him that sat upon it.<a name=400:12></a> In the fourth chapter the One sitting on the throne is God, in the fifth He is the Lamb.<a name=400:13></a> In the fourth He is the Creator, for Him all things were made.<a name=400:14></a> In the fifth He is Redeemer, the Lamb, but the same Person.<a name=400:15></a> We have to apprehend Him in the two lights, but He is the same Person.<a name=400:16></a> We do not see God in the form proper to the Deity presented in the throne, but Jesus; He is the One that took a body, the form that we can see.<a name=400:17></a> We cannot see the form of God.<a name=400:18></a> No one has seen it or can see it, but Jesus has come into a

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Alongside these elders there are four <i>living</i> creatures.<a name=401:3></a> Four is symbolic of universality; it is not simply a part of the creation, but the whole realm or domain of creation brought back to God.<a name=401:4></a> You may say, that is all future.<a name=401:5></a> It is as to its setting here, but morally it exists today.<a name=401:6></a> James says that we are a first-fruits of God's creatures.<a name=401:7></a> We have the first-fruits of the Spirit and we are the first-fruits of God's creatures.<a name=401:8></a> We are sympathetic with God in feelings and sympathies and we are capable -- I am speaking to christians -- normally we are capable of action, of energy, and the whole scene in this sense is dominated by intelligence, and not intelligence only, but energy.<a name=401:9></a> The elders are not presented as energetic.<a name=401:10></a> That is not the sign; the energy is in the living creatures.<a name=401:11></a> So that we find that the first is like a lion, the second like a calf, the third has the face of a man, and the fourth is like a flying eagle.<a name=401:12></a> Put these things together and you have a wonderful array of energy, not only steady, calculated energy, but such energy as may be seen in the rapidity of the eagle; that when the mind of God is understood and known there is to be no delay, for the King's business requires haste.<a name=401:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, that is the position; and I mention the living creatures because in application now, it refers to the energy of the young men.<a name=401:14></a> "I have written to you, young men", says John, "because ye are strong, and the word of God abides in you" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:14">1 John  2:14</a>).<a name=401:15></a> You are capable of energy, and not only that but you have done something.<a name=401:16></a> That is an important matter for every young man who desires to serve.<a name=401:17></a> I would ask you, What have you done?<a name=401:18></a> What is your exploit?<a name=401:19></a> All the mighty men of David did exploits, and the apostle in sending
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=402>[Page 402]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		his salutation to the saints at Rome mentions the exploits of many.<a name=402:1></a> If you are gifted for service, what have you done?<a name=402:2></a> How has the energy been used?<a name=402:3></a> "I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong .<a name=402:4></a>.<a name=402:5></a>.<a name=402:6></a> and ye have overcome the wicked one".<a name=402:7></a> That is a great exploit but it belongs to the young men.<a name=402:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You see here what the living creatures did, and we are also told that they each had six wings, and they say day and night, "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty".<a name=402:9></a> That is what they say.<a name=402:10></a> You see, beloved, the energy.<a name=402:11></a> They have eyes inside.<a name=402:12></a> They have discernment, and they are thinking of the holiness of God.<a name=402:13></a> That is the kind of energy; that is the kind of life; life in young people is apt to take on natural things and what corrupts.<a name=402:14></a> There must be not only the exploit to indicate the power, but the holiness, as the apostle says to his youthful confidant Timothy, "But youthful lusts flee, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:22">2 Timothy  2:22</a>).<a name=402:15></a> That is a word for young people.<a name=402:16></a> Flee youthful lusts, so that the energy should be uncontaminated, that we should be pure in our service, and able to say day and night, as it were, "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty".<a name=402:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to point out that the elders are watching all this.<a name=402:18></a> It is the combination of these things that I want to bring before you.<a name=402:19></a> When the living creatures "give glory and honour and thanksgiving to him that sits upon the throne", the elders fall down before Him and they worship, and they tell us why they do it.<a name=402:20></a> That is a most important feature in the assembly in the worship of God: there is not only the energy of life and the holiness, but the intelligence that would give the reason for what is done, and those who are near will have respect to it, if they are normal.<a name=402:21></a> The elders tell us why they

	<div class="paragraph">
		fall down and worship.<a name=403:1></a> They know, like the fathers in the epistle of John; he wrote to them, because they had "known him that is from the beginning" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:13">1 John  2:13</a>).<a name=403:2></a> Those who know Him from the beginning know how things should be done, every kind of thing, and they would observe how He did things, how He dealt with matters.<a name=403:3></a> Hence when an apostle is to be chosen Peter says that he must be one who had assembled with them during all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among them, from the baptism of John until He was taken up.<a name=403:4></a> That is the idea; it is the full ministry of Christ on earth.<a name=403:5></a> That is what makes an elder; he knows the why and wherefore of things.<a name=403:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Just to touch on the next chapter for a moment, you will observe that the position of the elders is transposed.<a name=403:7></a> The living creatures come first in the fifth chapter; I mean when they are seen together.<a name=403:8></a> One of the elders firstly tells John how the book should be opened, that the Lion of the tribe of Juda should do it; He has prevailed to do it.<a name=403:9></a> That would be an exploit.<a name=403:10></a> Then you see "in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing, as slain".<a name=403:11></a> It is interesting and instructive, too, to notice the transposition, the living creatures first and the elders second.<a name=403:12></a> It is as if the elders take second place, which love will ever do when it is in service.<a name=403:13></a> No one is morally right who cannot take a second place.<a name=403:14></a> The Lord Jesus has taken a second place; He has led the way, and here the elders take a second place.<a name=403:15></a> It is in the interests of the service.<a name=403:16></a> We must always be ready, however experienced, however intelligent, when certain crises arise requiring energy rather than spiritual intelligence, to let the energetic ones be in front.<a name=403:17></a> It is energy here, with intelligence of course, for the living creatures understand, and the elders are second.<a name=403:18></a> It is a time of action.<a name=403:19></a> The fifth chapter is

		action.<a name=404:1></a> It is the Lion of the tribe of Juda doing things; He is going to open the book; He is going to open the seals, and as He opens each of the first four, a living creature is attending.<a name=404:2></a> That is action.<a name=404:3></a> Opening seals is a matter of energy, a matter of power, and that is what a living creature represents.<a name=404:4></a> So, beloved brethren, what is needed is energy, that living creatures should be present in the service of God.<a name=404:5></a>

		You will observe, dear brethren, that these scriptures allude to prophetesses.<a name=445:1></a> Other scriptures speak of them also, but these four serve to convey what I understand to be set out in the thought of a prophetess.<a name=445:2></a> Others, as I said, are alluded to, some bad ones -- for the enemy never fails to imitate what God introduces and uses, so that we have "the woman Jezebel, she who calls herself prophetess", (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2:20">Revelation  2:20</a>).<a name=445:3></a> The most sinister feminine name in the Scriptures is Jezebel.<a name=445:4></a> What makes her name so important is that she exists today, and is employing her nefarious powers to the utmost.<a name=445:5></a> That she calls <i>herself</i> prophetess is significant, for it is a feature of that system to which she belongs, which is essentially Babylonish, and which implies worldly show, worldly distinction, and worldly greatness.<a name=445:6></a> Simon called Magus gave out that <i>he was</i> "some great one" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#8:9">Acts  8:9</a>), and Jezebel calls <i>herself</i> prophetess.<a name=445:7></a> The Spirit of God leaves us in no doubt as to what her prophesying implies, and that its effects are according to what she teaches.<a name=445:8></a> Not only are common people her victims, but servants -- the Lord's servants: "she teaches and leads astray my servants" -- (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2:20">Revelation  2:20</a>) -- teaching them the very worst things.<a name=445:9></a> I just allude to her so that we may have in mind what the subject implies; how the enemy uses the idea, and that this personage symbolizes a great religious system, renowned for every iniquity, which has built itself up and spreads its influence abroad.<a name=445:10></a>

		These are negative features of the subject, and it is sorrowful to own not merely historic, but current dangers.<a name=446:11></a> Jezebel and Noadiah, correspond in their characteristics, the latter coming very near to us, and we have to be on our guard that we are not hampering the servants of God by supposing danger.<a name=446:12></a> The Lord will stand by those who serve however great the danger, as Paul says, "The Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me", (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#4:18">2 Timothy  4:18</a>).<a name=446:13></a>

		She is not regarded officially as Aaron was: Moses was to be God to him, and Aaron was his prophet, whereas there is nothing said about Miriam being appointed.<a name=448:1></a> Now what I want to point out in a practical way is, that this ability for service, in one limited by her sex, is indicated by influence for good, and who can deny the scope of influence for good?<a name=448:2></a> In whomsoever it is found, influence for good is rare.<a name=448:3></a> Miriam's good influence is over the women here.<a name=448:4></a> She moves Godward with her timbrel.<a name=448:5></a> A good lead had been given by Moses in the song, and she is surrounded by the influence of a great victory, and consequently there is liberty.<a name=448:6></a> She is more than equal to it; she can join in the song, and that of herself.<a name=448:7></a> She does not collaborate with others of her sex to form a party to extend her influence, but she takes her timbrel herself and moves.<a name=448:8></a> She moves, not as bringing forward something distinctive, but in connection with the great lead that had been given by Moses, and the women went after her.<a name=448:9></a> I wish to point out what is meant, for influence for good is to be valued, and way is to be made for it, so that the women went after her with their timbrels.<a name=448:10></a> It was a wonderful movement, but it did not go beyond the women of Israel.<a name=448:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Deborah shows another feature in a prophetess.<a name=449:9></a> The first as we have seen, is influence for good over those on one's own level.<a name=449:10></a> Deborah presents a remarkable picture of this subject; she represents the womanly side.<a name=449:11></a> I am not speaking of sisters serving, but of how power lifts out of limitations.<a name=449:12></a> If a sister prays, she is to be covered, recognizing thus the province that belongs to man.<a name=449:13></a> If God has given her power, He is not setting aside another principle, so that the covering of the head is the recognition of the ordering of God.<a name=449:14></a> That ordering is not violated.<a name=449:15></a> But it is sovereign power you find with Deborah.<a name=449:16></a> She is a womanly woman.<a name=449:17></a> -- She is spoken of as "a woman prophetess" (see note in the New Translation, <a href="../bible/Judges.htm#4:4">Judges  4:4</a>).<a name=449:18></a> Christianity is intended to develop what is womanly.<a name=449:19></a> <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:27">Genesis  1:27</a> tells us "male and female created he them", both terms being given under the idea of "Man".<a name=449:20></a>

		J.T.<a name=456:6></a> Well, I think that the epistle to the Romans teaches each of us how to judge <i>himself</i>.<a name=456:7></a> The gospel finds us guilty persons, for it is said, all are brought in guilty before God (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3:19">Romans  3:19</a>).<a name=456:8></a> The believer learns how to judge guilt by God's treatment of himself, and how his guilt has been vicariously met in the death of the Lord Jesus, how that there was no other way for God to deal with sin and save the sinner but by a vicarious death; in this way one learns what sin is in the sight of God.<a name=456:9></a> That is Romans.<a name=456:10></a> The wrath of God is said to be revealed from heaven against all unrighteousness of men; it is revealed from heaven.<a name=456:11></a> The believer escapes it because of faith in Christ.<a name=456:12></a> Christ died to bear the wrath for him, but in due course the wrath will be executed on the unbeliever according to God's judgment of Christ when He was made sin for us, so that the cross is the measure of judgment.<a name=456:13></a> But then the saint also learns to judge the systems that men have built up, according to God's judgment of sin in the believer himself.<a name=456:14></a> God would bring all His people round to His point of view.<a name=456:15></a> The Lord said, "Now is the judgment of this world" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#12:31">John  12:31</a>), before He died, and He would bring all His people to that.<a name=456:16></a> It gives great moral power and stability to the saints as arriving at this judgment.<a name=456:17></a> They are thus on the side of God.<a name=456:18></a>

		J.T.<a name=457:7></a> That is what I was thinking.<a name=457:8></a> Romans teaches the believer how to judge sin in himself.<a name=457:9></a> Corinthians teaches us how to judge it collectively, that is to judge it in the assembly, and 2 Timothy teaches us how to judge it when it has got out of hand in the assembly, when there is no power in the public body to deal with it; then the believer has to take a negative attitude towards it by withdrawing from it.<a name=457:10></a> He does that because of his deliberate judgment of it, and in that he is on God's side, as shown in the book of Revelation.<a name=457:11></a> That is to say, the book of Revelation, particularly the addresses to the assemblies, is in view from the time that the assembly was unable to deal with the evil in itself.<a name=457:12></a> From the time these letters had to be written to them they have failed to judge in themselves the evil, and now all is waiting for God to judge it, and the believer or the overcomer in each assembly is taking sides with God, waiting for Him to come in.<a name=457:13></a> 2 Timothy is, as has often been remarked, the charter for God's people when the public body is unable to deal with the evil within itself.<a name=457:14></a>

		My remarks, dear brethren, will relate to <i>treasuries</i>, that is, as the word indicates, receptacles for treasures, and I hope to show, by the Lord's help, that the divine intent is that each believer in Christ, as receiving the Holy Spirit, is a treasury.<a name=474:1></a> I read from <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#28">1 Chronicles  28</a>, because we have the word in the plural there -- "treasuries", as you will observe in verse 11, "the treasuries thereof", and then in verse 12, "the treasuries of the house of God", and "the treasuries of the dedicated things".<a name=474:2></a> The word "treasuries" being so much stressed in the pattern of the house which David had by the Spirit, and which he gave to Solomon, is to call attention to the saints; it is a type of the saints as containing the precious things of God.<a name=474:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The more we are reminded of what we are in the divine thought, the more dignified we become.<a name=474:4></a> If God says, "ye are all God's sons by faith in Christ Jesus" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3:26">Galatians  3:26</a>), the reception of this statement in the soul conveys a sense of dignity to us; and so if we are regarded as treasuries in the house, we begin, if we are upright, to look about and see whether doors are left unlocked, so to speak, whether the enemy has access, or whether we are letting things out thoughtlessly, which he can use in his <i>imitative</i> operations, for this is, in a very large measure, his way of opposition (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#3:8">2 Timothy  3:8</a>).<a name=474:5></a> We see in the second letter to Timothy, that the mode of opposition was imitation; Jannes and Jambres are alluded to as withstanding God in Moses by imitation, and any clue they might get from Moses or Aaron, or those about Moses and Aaron, as to their mode of operations, would be turned against the service of God.<a name=474:6></a>

		This epistle, among many other things, introduces the thought before me at this time.<a name=475:1></a> The verse should read, "Keep, by the Holy Spirit which dwells in us, the good deposit entrusted".<a name=475:2></a> That is a remarkable statement, obviously not for Timothy alone, but for all who are included in the assembly, in which, as the mystery, are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.<a name=475:3></a> The mystery itself suggests the idea of a treasury, and the idea necessarily attaches to us as forming it; for the assembly, to be very simple, is formed of ourselves -- I mean christians.<a name=475:4></a> The thought should never be, initially, at least, very distant from us or difficult to understand, for in truth it is a question of a believer understanding himself, and to understand oneself, one has to be analytical; the great gospel epistle, Romans, teaches us how to be analytical, both as to ourselves and the truth generally (compare chapter 7).<a name=475:5></a>

		The believer is to be a receptacle of divine things and, to this end, he is to have all the compartments, as it were, of his moral being, including, indeed, his physical being, under his control.<a name=475:6></a> One of the most important fruits of the Spirit, as in the believer, is "self-control", and in this "to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honour" (<a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#4:4">1 Thessalonians  4:4</a>), to have his "fruit unto holiness" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:22">Romans  6:22</a>).<a name=475:7></a> So that the inner chambers are holy, and as holy, available to the Lord for the great things He has, not only for our relief and enjoyment, but to be kept by us, deposited in us, at it were, to be kept securely until that day.<a name=475:8></a> The apostle Paul speaks about himself and those with him as having "this treasure in earthen vessels" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:7">2 Corinthians  4:7</a>).<a name=475:9></a> What he alluded to was the ministry of the new covenant.<a name=475:10></a> How great would be the accession to any company of christians among whom the apostle would sit down, for instance, at the Lord's supper!<a name=475:11></a> He had the treasure, which he had been speaking of, as the ministry of the new covenant.<a name=475:12></a> It would be there, it would be present

		as he sat amongst his brethren, and it is quite obvious that the more there were like him, or nearly like him, the greater would be the wealth of the company.<a name=476:1></a> He says, "we have this treasure in earthen vessels"; he is alluding to his body.<a name=476:2></a> Weak though it would appear to be, as if at any time it might be destroyed, the enemy being ready to take any advantage he could to destroy that great vessel -- it was weak, it was earthen, meaning that it was fragile; nevertheless, there he was, day after day, year after year, maintaining the ministry in freshness and power.<a name=476:3></a> He carried about the treasure and maintained it in integrity, and so, throughout his ministry, he indicates to us the idea of the treasury.<a name=476:4></a> If his body were frail, if the enemy apparently might break it at any moment, he says, "that the surpassingness of the power may be of God, and not from us" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:7">2 Corinthians  4:7</a>), that is to say, God <i>kept</i> him in his fragility.<a name=476:5></a> He was kept in accordance with the divine thought until the last moment of his service down here; the enemy did not succeed in taking away one moment from his life; his service was completed.<a name=476:6></a>

		I speak of the way the treasure was kept, the power of keeping, and I believe Paul represents the idea perhaps as much as any person mentioned in Scripture.<a name=476:7></a> For instance, as he approached Corinth to serve, he had the understanding of what was needed, and kept back from them what could not profit them because of their state.<a name=476:8></a> What power of restraint there was in that vessel; He says, "And <i>I</i>, brethren, have not been able to speak to you as to spiritual" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3:1">1 Corinthians  3:1</a>); so he kept back what they could not receive.<a name=476:9></a> Not that he could not have spoken, for he says, "we speak God's wisdom in a mystery, that hidden wisdom which God had predetermined before the ages for our glory", (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:7">1 Corinthians  2:7</a>).<a name=476:10></a> He could keep all that within the recesses of his treasury.<a name=476:11></a> It was a

		So you find, in the New Testament, persons such as Mary, the mother of the Lord; who is one of the greatest examples.<a name=477:6></a> We have it in the Old Testament in persons such as Daniel, who, having a vision as to the gentile monarchies, especially the fourth one, that with which we have to do today, says, "I kept the matter in my heart", (<a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#7:28">Daniel  7:28</a>).<a name=477:7></a> It was not to be kept there for ever, but it was wise to keep it, and he kept it in his heart until the time arrived for its disclosure.<a name=477:8></a> And so it was with Mary as things came to her; the wonderful things about the Babe that was to be born of her.<a name=477:9></a> She had received instruction as to Him beforehand, but then other things arose.<a name=477:10></a> She might have thought to herself; I must keep what Gabriel said to me, I must cherish that but these shepherds, what they say is a matter of comparatively little consequence.<a name=477:11></a> But, no; what they said was for her, and Scripture says, she "kept all these things and pondered them in her heart" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:19">Luke  2:19</a>).<a name=477:12></a> Through whomsoever they may come, through Gabriel, a shepherd, or a wise man from the East, whatever the medium through which the mind of God comes, the treasure is to be kept; it is valuable.<a name=477:13></a> It must not be allowed loose, as it were, as something common.<a name=477:14></a> We are to recognize that God's things are

		We get this principle early in the Scriptures, in Jacob, a man of very great consequence spiritually.<a name=478:3></a> The early dreams of Joseph -- what treasures they were!<a name=478:4></a> He had spoken of his sheaf standing upright, and his brothers' sheaves all round doing obeisance to his sheaf.<a name=478:5></a> This drew out the hatred of his brothers, but Jacob "<i>kept</i> the saying", (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#37:11">Genesis  37:11</a>).<a name=478:6></a> What does that keeping by the patriarch mean, but that the thing was of value?<a name=478:7></a> Jacob later says, "I wait for thy salvation, O Jehovah", (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#49:18">Genesis  49:18</a>).<a name=478:8></a> He looked forward to the salvation of God, and Simeon said later, "mine eyes have seen thy salvation", (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:30">Luke  2:30</a>).<a name=478:9></a> And so it was with every treasure, from Adam onwards, for the treasures of God began early.<a name=478:10></a> As the Lord says, "For this reason every scribe discipled to the kingdom of the heavens is like a man that is a householder who brings out of his treasure things new and old", (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13:52">Matthew  13:52</a>).<a name=478:11></a>

		Yellow is something extraordinary in the way of sin.<a name=494:3></a> Maybe there is an infidel here, a sceptic, a modernist, or a unitarian.<a name=494:4></a> It is in the head, and points to evil working in the mind.<a name=494:5></a> The word "yellow" is only used here in <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#13">Leviticus  13</a>, and once elsewhere in Scripture.<a name=494:6></a> It is used here very significantly; it refers to sins, including <i>modernism</i>, relating to christendom, where men work out evil things mentally.<a name=494:7></a> This is a question of what is in the head of a man or woman.<a name=494:8></a> The schools are full of it -- this leprosy in the head -- and the children are imbibing it; that is what the devil is aiming at.<a name=494:9></a> If there is one who does not believe in the deity of Christ, or in eternal punishment, or in the inspiration of the Scriptures, or the facts of the gospel, due to the influence of what men have evolved out of their heads by the devil's power, this word is for you.<a name=494:10></a> It is the worst kind of sin.<a name=494:11></a> The priest searches no further; as soon as he sees the yellow hair all is settled.<a name=494:12></a> The person is a leper.<a name=494:13></a> What is he to do?<a name=494:14></a> He must go outside the camp and put a covering on his lip, and say, "Unclean, unclean!<a name=494:15></a>" He has to <i>admit</i> the leprosy.<a name=494:16></a> As soon as he admits and confesses it, the next chapter tells us how he may be cleansed, so that he does not need to stay outside the camp.<a name=494:17></a> I cannot speak more of that now; I am mainly speaking of what is set forth in the colour.<a name=494:18></a>

		Now in Song of Songs we have blackness, and the speaker tells us the cause of it.<a name=494:19></a> It is a question of the <i>governmental</i> dealings of God.<a name=494:20></a> Many are under the governmental dealings of God.<a name=494:21></a> "The sun hath looked upon me", she says.<a name=494:22></a> She is a believer; and not only so, she is comely, as she says in verse 5, "as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon".<a name=494:23></a> She is comely, a true believer -- but under the governmental dealings of God she is

		Well, this book tells us how all this is altered.<a name=495:5></a> This woman had an appreciation of colours.<a name=495:6></a> If you look at her description of Christ in chapter 5:10, you will see this.<a name=495:7></a> "My beloved is white and ruddy", she says.<a name=495:8></a> White is a symbol of purity, as we had it in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#1:18">Isaiah  1:18</a>; "white as snow"; it means purity according to God; but in the setting of this book, which is highly poetical and full of feeling and holy sentiment centring in Christ, we have a blend of whiteness and ruddiness, it is beautification.<a name=495:9></a> "My beloved", she says, "is white and ruddy".<a name=495:10></a> So that whiteness and redness have a different meaning now; combined, they mean beautification.<a name=495:11></a>

		This speaker, as she begins to speak, knows she is without it, but she knows the Beloved has it.<a name=495:12></a> That is to say, one in such a case judges himself; he has not a word to say in self-vindication, but he has much to say about Jesus.<a name=495:13></a> The feminine speaker in Song of Songs comes herself also into beautification, for Christ takes her in hand.<a name=495:14></a> If there is anyone here "black" under the government of God, as she was, I would urge you to read this book, to study it.<a name=495:15></a> It will bring you to see that the Lord Jesus has means not only of purifying you, of removing the blackness, but of beautifying you.<a name=495:16></a> He will make you a nazarite, whiter than snow!<a name=495:17></a> Jeremiah in his plaint in <a href="../bible/Lamentations.htm#4:7">Lamentations  4:7</a> speaks about the Nazarites of Zion, and what they had been.<a name=495:18></a> He says, they were "purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more

		Is anyone in the sense of being black, unfit, feeling that he does not shine amongst his brethren, that he is not among the lilies?<a name=496:3></a> I would urge him to look into this book.<a name=496:4></a> It is within the range of the gospel, for why should I be black when others are white and ruddy?<a name=496:5></a> If I am to be in the assembly of God, it must be as corresponding with Christ.<a name=496:6></a> Can I afford, as one of His, to be outside the range of His assembly where every moral beauty is reflected from His face as it shines there?<a name=496:7></a> I cannot.<a name=496:8></a> Then read this book and you will see how one who is black becomes white and ruddy, and the form like sapphire, as Jeremiah says.<a name=496:9></a> Not only is there beautification in relation to these colours and combinations of colours as seen in the countenance, but their form is like sapphire.<a name=496:10></a> That becomes possible, and a certainty, as in faith I face my blackness, as did the feminine speaker here: she faced the matter.<a name=496:11></a> She knew her comeliness that she was a subject of the work of God; but she becomes black by the government of God which overtook her.<a name=496:12></a> Many have met with disaster in that way in recent years through the working of the will, through the desire to be rich, to better themselves in this world; and if we are found on that line the government of God will overtake us, and we shall lose our colour and become black instead of being whiter than snow and more ruddy than rubies.<a name=496:13></a>
