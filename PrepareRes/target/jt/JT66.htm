		J.T.<a name=1:1></a> One has thought of the idea of beginning.<a name=1:2></a> It may sound somewhat cumbersome as a subject, but it will show itself in time.<a name=1:3></a> It is in mind that we might have right terminology in our conversations; that the terminology may be intelligible and that the brethren may be on the alert to understand; for much is going abroad that is, to say the least, not clear in the sense of ministry, and the hope is that these meetings will help in the sense of clarity and in the sense of intelligibility as to Scripture; so that there may be freedom from mere novelties, and that we may be able to speak as the Bereans, who would search the Scriptures to see if these things were so.<a name=1:4></a> The thought is to carry the idea of the beginning; first as to <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>-- the beginning of things, the creative side, leaving man out; for the idea of 'things' carries down through the ages and enters into doctrine, constantly added to, but still the basic things are carried through.<a name=1:5></a> Then it is thought the second reading should have man in mind, especially seen in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2">Genesis  2</a>; and in later meetings the idea of the beginning in John's gospel and John's epistle.<a name=1:6></a> "That which was from the beginning" <a href="../bible/1John.htm#1:1">1 John  1:1</a>.<a name=1:7></a> Other features may open up as we proceed.<a name=1:8></a> Man is left out of this our first consideration, and, of course, we would all feel that the subject must be incomplete and it will be incomplete, for we have to learn in part.<a name=1:9></a> And so it is thought that we should confine ourselves to the things of creation in this first reading and then in the second reading to bring in the great thought of man, especially in chapter 2.<a name=1:10></a> There may be necessary enquiries in order to indicate the completion of the subject, but it is hoped we shall be able

		to limit ourselves to the passage read.<a name=2:1></a> As already said, we learn in part and there can be no doubt that God has this in mind in these readings; the remarkable interest there is among the brethren as to the Scriptures and scriptural subjects, and how we are able to go on with these readings and increase our learning, for the great intent is to learn.<a name=2:2></a> Learn something, whatever it may be, for our gain on each occasion.<a name=2:3></a> Learn in part, but learn.<a name=2:4></a> And so we have to consider the chaotic condition that is indicated in verses 1 and 2 of this chapter and see how light came in.<a name=2:5></a> "But all things having their true character exposed by the light are made manifest", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:13">Ephesians  5:13</a>.<a name=2:6></a> The first day, therefore, has to be considered as clarifying the whole position.<a name=2:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=2:8></a> Is it necessary to go back to the beginnings in order to get clear in our minds as to things?<a name=2:9></a> The Lord said in the gospels regarding a particular matter that came up with the Pharisees: "but from the beginning it was not thus", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#19:8">Matthew  19:8</a>.<a name=2:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:11></a> Well, I think that is good; and what has to be added is that the beginning is not an inscrutable matter.<a name=2:12></a> A beginning in itself is not an inscrutable matter.<a name=2:13></a> Certainly the beginning of things is not inscrutable, and so we have to consider what is in mind in verses 1 and 2.<a name=2:14></a> These first verses are inscrutable.<a name=2:15></a> They contemplate, of course, what God made.<a name=2:16></a> "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.<a name=2:17></a> And the earth was waste and empty, and darkness was on the face of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters".<a name=2:18></a> So that before we reach our brother's suggestion we have to touch a little on the inscrutable.<a name=2:19></a> The beginning in itself is not inscrutable, but God is.<a name=2:20></a> But when we come to the New Testament it will become more apparent that the beginning here is left.<a name=2:21></a> We cannot enter much on it, because it is left in chaos.<a name=2:22></a> Therefore, we have to seek to bring God

		into it, and see how in coming in He sheds light, and how the idea of beginnings is there and it must enter into all the created things; they became enlarged obviously as time went on, but we have to begin with the roots of things and see how they work out in the doctrine and ultimately in the doctrine of christianity.<a name=3:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.R.<a name=3:2></a> Why does John start his gospel as <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>"In the beginning"?<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:4></a> There is a very great difference in the phraseology.<a name=3:5></a> "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth", whereas in John it is, "In the beginning was the Word".<a name=3:6></a> It is inscrutable and infinite, and of course, better left until we come to it properly.<a name=3:7></a> But we can see the great difference between the two passages in that in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>it is a Person of the Deity.<a name=3:8></a> "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God".<a name=3:9></a> But now we are dealing with things; that is to say, God's creation of the heavens and the earth, and that chaos had come in; therefore the need for the introduction of the positive side.<a name=3:10></a> Verses 1 and 2 leave us in a chaotic condition.<a name=3:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=3:12></a> In relation to what has been said as to inscrutability entering into these earlier verses, do you have that in mind in relation to God in His personal existence or in relation to things?<a name=3:13></a> In what way are you referring to inscrutability in these opening verses?<a name=3:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:15></a> Just in the sense that God is alluded to.<a name=3:16></a> The footnote to the word "God" reads '(Elohim, the plural of Eloah, the Supreme.<a name=3:17></a> It is Deity, God in the absolute.<a name=3:18></a> When other divine names, except Jehovah and Jah, are used, they will be indicated)'.<a name=3:19></a> And then we have indications of the terms.<a name=3:20></a> But we are just left here with the simple thought of God, but we are not to rest upon that.<a name=3:21></a> It immediately carries on in the rest of the chapter to the thought of what He

	<div class="paragraph">
		does, what He created.<a name=4:1></a> And thus we come to material things, and they are not inscrutable; they are knowable.<a name=4:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.W.<a name=4:3></a>P.<a name=4:4></a> Would the word in the book of Job help us in connection with this question?<a name=4:5></a> "Hearken unto this, Job; stand still and discern the wondrous works of God".<a name=4:6></a> And then later on in the chapter: "The Almighty, we cannot find him out", <a href="../bible/Job.htm#37:14">Job  37:14</a>,23.<a name=4:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:8></a> Well, it helps as to what happened in the years that followed what is here.<a name=4:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.W.<a name=4:10></a>P.<a name=4:11></a> "The Almighty" not being found out would be inscrutability, but the works of God are what is seen?<a name=4:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:13></a> That would involve a further period of time.<a name=4:14></a> That is to say, the knowledge of God came into being, and people had been learning.<a name=4:15></a> I believe that Enoch is the first one to indicate to us that the learning time had come; and of course, Job lived many years after.<a name=4:16></a> The flood intervenes and much else, and what we get as to Job has to be fitted in there, but not with the first verses, all indicating a period much further on than this first section.<a name=4:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.J.<a name=4:18></a>H.<a name=4:19></a> Does Isaiah give the divine intent: "Thus saith God, Jehovah, he that created the heavens and stretched them out, he that spread forth the earth and its productions" <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#42:5">Isaiah  42:5</a>, and also, "For thus saith Jehovah who created the heavens, God himself who formed the earth and made it, he who established it, -- not as waste did he create it: he formed it to be inhabited" <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#45:18">Isaiah  45:18</a>.<a name=4:20></a> Is that the intent of God?<a name=4:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:22></a> Quite.<a name=4:23></a> Much had intervened and the prophets come into that.<a name=4:24></a> Moses comes into it and others.<a name=4:25></a> The time of learning had come.<a name=4:26></a> Men were not slow; there were some who learned, but many did not.<a name=4:27></a> Enoch did.<a name=4:28></a> No doubt he represents persons able to learn.<a name=4:29></a>

		A.N.<a name=5:1></a>W.<a name=5:2></a> Is the use of the word 'supreme' in a way relative and should we realise that the absolute Person is behind that appellation?<a name=5:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:4></a> Quite; the Supreme must be supreme to something.<a name=5:5></a> It is a relative term, but even 'God' is to be regarded as relative in a certain sense.<a name=5:6></a> At the same time, the idea of relativeness and abstract must be understood if we are to get anything out of our enquiry.<a name=5:7></a> God Himself is not relative to anyone or anything.<a name=5:8></a> He is abstract; He is entitled to be that; whereas as soon as He creates or has things to be in relation to, then He is relative.<a name=5:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=5:10></a> In the note Mr.<a name=5:11></a> Darby points out: '(It is Deity, God in the absolute)'.<a name=5:12></a> Is the use of the word 'absolute' there the same as you have used in recent times in referring to absoluteness in relation to God?<a name=5:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:14></a> I do not think so.<a name=5:15></a> The word 'absolute' is abstract really.<a name=5:16></a> He is absolute to something.<a name=5:17></a> I mean, the reference is that; it is the Absolute to something.<a name=5:18></a> I do not remember that I ever used the word as we now use it in recent times.<a name=5:19></a> We have to get the idea into our souls of God ".<a name=5:20></a>.<a name=5:21></a>.<a name=5:22></a> dwelling in unapproachable light; whom no man has seen, nor is able to see", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#6:16">1 Timothy  6:16</a>.<a name=5:23></a> We have to learn to use these words and in some sense understand their application, and thus the idea of relativity in each as in touch with everything.<a name=5:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.B.<a name=5:25></a>P.<a name=5:26></a> The introduction into Scripture of the great thought of inscrutability in the Deity is to rouse our hearts in worship in view of all that has been done.<a name=5:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:28></a> Quite so; in the sense in which we are able to take it on.<a name=5:29></a> God begins with us in great patience.<a name=5:30></a> We have just seen that He leaves out the idea of naming certain things, especially Satan.<a name=5:31></a> The time will come when it is brought in in fulness.<a name=5:32></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.B.<a name=5:33></a> Is there something in the fact that the word

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'created' is only in verse 1?<a name=6:1></a> It comes in again in relation to the sea monsters; after that we get the word 'made'.<a name=6:2></a> Is there something in that for us?<a name=6:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:4></a> There is; the word as to what God blesses comes under that heading.<a name=6:5></a> He blesses the fishes and the fowls which would indicate that He is in relation to life, even in the creation.<a name=6:6></a> That is, sea monsters, fishes and fowls and the like -- He is in relation to that.<a name=6:7></a> They are something He is pleased with and something that He blesses.<a name=6:8></a> In verse 22 we get it for the first time: "God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply on the earth".<a name=6:9></a> Now the thought arises there as to what became of the fish, and yet they have a great place in the instructive part of Scripture.<a name=6:10></a> They are not especially mentioned in regard of the flood, and yet they went through.<a name=6:11></a> There must have been something in the mind of God in regard of them in view of the flood.<a name=6:12></a> They would be carried through because they have a great place in the Scripture later.<a name=6:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.H.<a name=6:14></a>H.<a name=6:15></a> What is the difference between God known in the absolute and in the abstract?<a name=6:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:17></a> Well, the word 'absolute' has a meaning, of course, which involves relativity, but 'abstract' does not.<a name=6:18></a> The word 'abstract' is simply that He is not in relation to anything but Himself.<a name=6:19></a> 'Absolute' and 'abstract' have not just the same significance.<a name=6:20></a> The idea of absoluteness comes into relativity.<a name=6:21></a> If absolute, it is absolute in relation to something.<a name=6:22></a>

		Now coming back to these six days, which are our subject, leaving the chaotic conditions which we are entitled to do -- God would not detain us, although He touches it in the prophets, but what He leads us to immediately is light.<a name=6:23></a> "And God said, Let there be light.<a name=6:24></a> And there was light.<a name=6:25></a> And God saw the light that it was good; and God divided between the light and the darkness.<a name=6:26></a> And God called the light Day,

	<div class="paragraph">
		and the darkness he called Night".<a name=7:1></a> So now we are in a position to speak of the darkness around us and the need to keep clear of it and live in positive things in the realm of light; not spreading out too much but confining ourselves as Scripture does, to the beginning, the idea of light.<a name=7:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.W.<a name=7:3></a>P.<a name=7:4></a> Is there a difference between this light and the lights as in verse 14 and the great lights in verse 16?<a name=7:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:6></a> The idea of light is what we have just read.<a name=7:7></a> "And God said, Let there be light".<a name=7:8></a> In later references, we come down to things called lights, but the truth is the word as light appears.<a name=7:9></a> We do well to stop with the first day and see how far we can go; see how far we can accustom ourselves in dealing with things that refer to it in a limited way; learn to be limited when necessary.<a name=7:10></a> We are not to spread out when it is not necessary.<a name=7:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.H.<a name=7:12></a> In your prayer you spoke of the lack of clarity in what is ministered, giving the clue to what you had in mind in this scripture.<a name=7:13></a> Have you in mind that each of these days has a feature that might well characterise the ministry?<a name=7:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:15></a> Well, quite so.<a name=7:16></a> We are to learn to limit ourselves to any given time or thing; just limit ourselves and not be extravagant in speaking of it.<a name=7:17></a> We often become extravagant and lose the full sense of it.<a name=7:18></a> It becomes too big, bigger than it was intended to be.<a name=7:19></a> We are to learn to limit ourselves.<a name=7:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.H.<a name=7:21></a> Is that why the beginning and introduction of evil is not dealt with here?<a name=7:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:23></a> God does not plunge us into evil.<a name=7:24></a> He does not even name Satan.<a name=7:25></a> If we were teaching children we would be simple about it and begin with good things, positive things, lovely things: "whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are noble, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are amiable, whatsoever things are

		C.A.<a name=8:11></a>M.<a name=8:12></a> The question in my mind is the reason this matter of waste and empty and darkness is brought in before we have this great matter of light, and I was asking whether this is because of the way our minds will apprehend light in contrast to darkness.<a name=8:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=8:14></a> We are not able to.<a name=8:15></a> It is the infinite side of things, and we are not required to dip into things beyond us.<a name=8:16></a> The time will come for dealing with them profitably, and we then will not be damaged by them.<a name=8:17></a> These things are just left and immediately we proceed to what is positive.<a name=8:18></a> "And God said, Let there be light.<a name=8:19></a> And there was light".<a name=8:20></a> We have already alluded to it: "And the earth was waste and empty, and darkness was on the face of the deep".<a name=8:21></a> Well, we cannot say much; the best way is to leave that.<a name=8:22></a> The Spirit of God says, "And God said, Let there be light.<a name=8:23></a> And there was light".<a name=8:24></a> We are in a wonderful realm in the word 'light'.<a name=8:25></a> He is not using lights but light.<a name=8:26></a> The word in the plural is used later, but not yet.<a name=8:27></a> We have to learn to rest in light; so the word in John's epistle is: "But if we walk in the light as <i>he</i> is in the light, we have fellowship with one another", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#1:7">1 John  1:7</a>.<a name=8:28></a>

		C.H.<a name=8:29></a>H.<a name=8:30></a> I was thinking of the term in Timothy: "unapproachable light" -- that would not connect with <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>.<a name=8:31></a>

		J.T.<a name=9:19></a> That is just what is said here.<a name=9:20></a> Faith comes by a report.<a name=9:21></a> Many of us may have in our minds that it is the act of God.<a name=9:22></a> Faith is the sovereign action of God; something is done by God sovereignly.<a name=9:23></a> So faith is there, it has to be there in the soul.<a name=9:24></a> But we are now linking on the word.<a name=9:25></a> That is one of the things instrumentally that God has in dealing with all these matters in creation.<a name=9:26></a> He has the instrumentality of dealing with them, and the instrumentality is the word, His word.<a name=9:27></a> And so in these verses we have read, "But they have not all obeyed the glad tidings.<a name=9:28></a> For Esaias says, Lord, who has believed our report?<a name=9:29></a>" <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#10:16">Romans  10:16</a>.<a name=9:30></a> That is, Israel -- what Isaiah says of them.<a name=9:31></a> And then the apostle goes on: "So faith then is by a report, but the report by God's word".<a name=9:32></a> So that we have to think about these scriptures, both by Paul and by Isaiah and then in the scripture before us, where God comes into it.<a name=9:33></a> God <i>says</i> here.<a name=9:34></a> We have that in verse 3: "And God said, Let there be light, And there was light".<a name=9:35></a> God says something and when He says something there is light; something has happened.<a name=9:36></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=26:1></a> As indicated already the thought is to look into chapter 2 in Genesis this afternoon.<a name=26:2></a> While we touched on the sixth day at our earlier reading, we did not complete the details.<a name=26:3></a> We ran on to the end of chapter 1.<a name=26:4></a> Indeed, the whole matter of the creation runs on from chapter 1 to the end of verse 3 of chapter 2, and then the second contemplates a new title taken on by God; a dual title really, the Lord God, Jehovah Elohim; meaning He had entered into special covenant relation with man.<a name=26:5></a> It is thought now that we should touch on the further part of the sixth day and then enter definitely on chapter 2 in which the covenant relation which God had taken on with man was contemplated.<a name=26:6></a> Chapter 1:26 reads, "And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over the whole earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth on the earth.<a name=26:7></a> And God created Man in his image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them".<a name=26:8></a> Another thing is to be noted: that word for 'man' in verse 26 is somewhat altered; in verse 27 it signifies the Adam, the man.<a name=26:9></a> That is to say, that great creature had taken on definiteness in title.<a name=26:10></a> Thus we can understand chapter 2 which properly begins with verse 4 in which we have the word called 'history'.<a name=26:11></a> "These are the histories of the heavens and the earth, when they were created, in the day that Jehovah Elohim made earth and heavens".<a name=26:12></a> That is to say, the earth is taken up definitely as a creation and having a history.<a name=26:13></a> The word 'history' signifies origin, so that we are now

		It appears first in this chapter and in the sense of a vision, so that we evidently arrive at enlargement, for God anticipated Abraham; "After these things the word of Jehovah came to Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram; I am thy shield, thy exceeding great reward", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#15:1">Genesis  15:1</a>.<a name=49:29></a> That was anticipative of

	<div class="paragraph">
		We have what God had in His heart, and how He would expand His thoughts in view of Abraham.<a name=50:7></a> So it says, verse 2, we must remember that he is speaking in the presence of a vision, "And Abram said, Lord Jehovah, what wilt thou give me?<a name=50:8></a> seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus.<a name=50:9></a> And Abram said, Lo, to me thou hast given no seed, and behold, a son of my house will be mine heir.<a name=50:10></a> And behold, the word of Jehovah came to him, saying, This shall not be thine heir, but he that will come forth out of thy body shall be thine heir.<a name=50:11></a> And he led him out, and said, Look now toward the heavens, and number the stars if thou be able to number them.<a name=50:12></a> And he said to him, So shall thy seed be!<a name=50:13></a> And he believed Jehovah; and he reckoned it to him as righteousness.<a name=50:14></a> And he said to him, I am Jehovah who brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give thee this land to possess it.<a name=50:15></a> And he said, Lord Jehovah, how shall I know that I shall possess it?<a name=50:16></a>" That is to say, how is he to know it?<a name=50:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In looking into John's gospel and his writings generally, it may be remarked that they are included, although late, in the general thought of revelation which marks Christianity.<a name=69:7></a> There seems to have been a need for a restatement of facts (John's gospel evidently coming in the latest of all in the written page) from the purely spiritual standpoint and, of course, therefore, the standpoint of inspiration.<a name=69:8></a> Much had been written, too, in the way of description and history, but the gospel of John seems to fit in to give us authoritatively an account of things spiritually; so that the history of Christianity would be on a sure basis and run on to the end, John having been in mind when the Lord said, "If I will that he abide until I come, what is that to thee?<a name=69:9></a>" <a href="../bible/John.htm#21:22">John  21:22</a>.<a name=69:10></a>

		It was a matter for the Lord to decide as to whether John should tarry until He returned, but evidently the Lord meant that His coming should be prolonged and not so immediate as might have been thought.<a name=70:1></a> Prolongation seemed to be a feature in that sense of this section of Scripture.<a name=70:2></a> And so the idea of the beginning marks the gospel of John as it does the book of Genesis, only the gospel of John, as has been remarked, deals with Christianity, the greatest of all dispensations; and, indeed, one might say, the last word as to everything for all the dispensations come upon us, Paul says.<a name=70:3></a> And now it behoves us, if we look into the thing rightly, to fix our minds on the Person of the Lord Jesus; not as in John's epistle because it is the neuter word there, "that which", whereas in the gospel it is, "In the beginning was the Word".<a name=70:4></a> That is, it is purely personal, and it is what is to be predicated of Him personally, extending back to His place in the Deity; not only in time but in the Deity, because it is not only that the Word was in the beginning, but the Word was with God-the idea of the association of the Word with God, and then that He was God.<a name=70:5></a> So that there will be no question in any mind save a reprobate one as to the Deity of our Lord Jesus Christ, and that He is the same Person in the Deity as He is in humanity, only His condition is outwardly changed in humanity.<a name=70:6></a> And so this section of the gospel, that is to the end of verse 18, includes the idea of the incarnation; not only the personal existence of the Lord in the Deity but His incarnate condition.<a name=70:7></a> Therefore, we have comprehensive facts which may be distributed right down the dispensation, and have been, too; the root facts distributed in the power of the Spirit, and, of course, that is greatly stressed in John's gospel-the presence of the Holy Spirit.<a name=70:8></a>

		J.T.<a name=93:3></a> Well, quite; and love, too.<a name=93:4></a> Simeon may be taken as representative of initial affection in that sense: "he received him into his arms, and blessed God, and said, Lord, now thou lettest thy bondman go, according to thy word, in peace; for mine eyes have seen thy salvation", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:29">Luke  2:29</a>,30.<a name=93:5></a> And so as to our brother's suggestion as to this passage in John being possibly an allusion to the Lord as anointed, it seems to me that the whole Person is in mind in His history.<a name=93:6></a> Luke would stress that side, how He was taken into Simeon's arms, who immediately became a worshipper, for he blessed God; and how the Lord is viewed in Luke as born, and as a boy, which carries with it, because of age, some responsibility.<a name=93:7></a> So Mary connects responsibility immediately with her own position.<a name=93:8></a> She was really remiss in what had happened.<a name=93:9></a> In truth the ark was there, although not named.<a name=93:10></a> And so the Lord found His way Himself without having any reference to His parents.<a name=93:11></a> Mary said, "Behold thy father and I have sought thee distressed", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:48">Luke  2:48</a>, but He immediately says, with a suggestion of reproach, "Why is it that ye have sought me?<a name=93:12></a> Did ye not know that I ought to be occupied in my Father's business?<a name=93:13></a>" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:49">Luke  2:49</a>.<a name=93:14></a> So that He is in the presence of the universe already in responsibility, even if that responsibility or measure of it is to be limited in any way, as doubtless it was, because it seems so, by Himself, "And he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and he was in subjection to them", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:51">Luke  2:51</a>.<a name=93:15></a> He is there, we might say, in infinitude.<a name=93:16></a> The Person is there.<a name=93:17></a> His worth and dignity are already alluded to in our brother's remarks as to the "holy thing also which shall be born shall be called Son of God", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:35">Luke  1:35</a>.<a name=93:18></a> The immediate link between the birth as the 'holy thing' and the Son of God is to be noted; because the Son of God is the Person who is to be in full

		J.T.<a name=95:22></a> Well, the neuter being used, I suppose, is to stress reality.<a name=95:23></a> The word 'thing' had already been used -- "the holy thing" which must mean reality and, too, substance.<a name=95:24></a> So here it says, "That which was from the beginning, that which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes; that which we contemplated, and our hands handled".<a name=95:25></a> I am not sure that inscrutability is necessarily stressed; I think it is rather that reality is there.<a name=95:26></a> There is no mistake about it; the real Person is there.<a name=95:27></a>

		A.H.<a name=127:1></a> We have been thinking of this book in the light of the word that "I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify these things to you in the assemblies", (chapter 22:16), seeking to get moral and spiritual gain from looking into them, and would be glad if you would say a word in that relation as to this chapter.<a name=127:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=127:3></a> This book was evidently given later than John's epistles, necessitated by the conditions of the assembly as to the truth in general, so that it is said, "Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to show to his bondmen what must shortly take place; and he signified it, sending by his angel, to his bondman John, who testified the word of God", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:1">Revelation  1:1</a>,2 so that the word of God is involved, because the things are signified, not simply inspiration but signification.<a name=127:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This chapter may be regarded as one of the most distinctive as pointing to the signs.<a name=127:5></a> Here a great sign was seen in the heavens; therefore it is a question of signification, meaning that things are unfolded by signs, not simply in the sense in which the gospel speaks of signs, and not exactly wonders, but still they are wonderful things, they are really wonders; so here the sign is called great, and it is "a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars" -- rightly called a wonderful sign, but we have to find in the Scriptures identification.<a name=127:6></a> The sign involved is to be identified, and it calls attention to Israel, not the assembly but Israel, because she has the marks of Israel.<a name=127:7></a> "A woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars".<a name=127:8></a> She is clothed with authority, the sun being the ruler of the day, and then the moon

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=143:3></a> Chapter 25 is a question of what the people would supply to Jehovah as the outcome of love.<a name=143:4></a> Following chapter 25, what we have in chapter 26 is for housing.<a name=143:5></a> Verse 8 of chapter 25 reads, "And they shall make me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them.<a name=143:6></a> According to all that I shall shew thee, the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the utensils thereof, even so shall ye make it", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#25:8">Exodus  25:8</a>.<a name=143:7></a> It is the idea of pattern, and of course what Christ was here, as indicating what is of heaven down here, and having therefore conditions of housing and protection; it is really God's house, and that means Christ is here as Man as the pattern, and the assembly, too; that is the idea in the type, the dwelling-place of God.<a name=143:8></a> The quality of the metals, and so on, being so rich, reminds us of His house, "whose house are <i>we</i>", (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#3:6">Hebrews  3:6</a>); the saints are God's house.<a name=143:9></a> This is very cursory and may not be perfect, but calls attention to the saints and what they are down here, and it is intended to affect us, as now; we can take more account of it, with the Holy Spirit here among us to fill out the divine thought, and make it practical here below.<a name=143:10></a>

		What is to be said tonight centres around the word 'lawgiver' found in the first two scriptures, and the thought is in the last scripture, though not the word.<a name=202:1></a> It is not the idea of a lawgiver in the sense of arbitrarily asserting the law as a principle, though it <i>is</i> there, but as affording divine principles according to the New Testament.<a name=202:2></a> The Old Testament had the thought of the law, but of very inferior character and quality indeed; all the Old Testament, the whole of it, hardly rose to the full thought of the law of God, at least it was inferior to that of the New Testament, and tended to dwarf the people of God; and so we have in Galatians the thought of the <i>children</i> of God, although in the mind of God they had the character of sons.<a name=202:3></a> It is mentioned in the Old Testament that the people were sons of God, but not in the full sense; inferiority was stamped on the Old Testament; therefore they were kept under "guardians and stewards" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:2">Galatians  4:2</a>) till the time of the crucifixion.<a name=202:4></a> It does not apply to Christ personally, for He was Himself never less than God, but He entered into the period of law and all that attached to it and dignified it according to what He was.<a name=202:5></a> It was the period of law, and of sight, "the period fixed by the father", <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:2">Galatians  4:2</a>, not God exactly, but a figure of speech, the father having a place in any house, and fixing the period for his children; and the period I am speaking of is the period from the fixing of the law at Sinai; and now we are in the very greatest period ever fixed by God, and it cannot be stressed too much; we are sons of God "by faith in Christ Jesus" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3:26">Galatians  3:26</a>);

		What I read in the Old Testament has a certain inferiority to it, even the reference to the lawgiver in both books, as compared to the last scripture in 1 Corinthians.<a name=203:2></a> But here the sceptre is not to depart from Judah; he is not to give it up, and when we come to David, it is greatly increased; it reads in <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#23:3">2 Samuel  23:3</a>, "the ruler among men shall be just, ruling in the fear of God; and he shall be as the light of the morning, like the rising of the sun, a morning without clouds; when from the sunshine, after rain, the green grass springeth from the earth"; so David, in his last words, tells us what a king is to be and Jacob does not tell us that, but that "The sceptre will not depart from Judah, nor the lawgiver from between his feet"; the feet were not of much importance there, but the head and the affections, so that the position of Judah is really inferior; the position of the feet must be taken into account, and we must think of the young, and the older should be more intelligent, so that the younger should keep in touch with the older.<a name=203:3></a> Judah had not acquired that yet, the time had to be waited for; Moses, Aaron, Joshua, David, Josiah, all coming on to superiority of intelligence, but none had reached the fulness of time; that was when Christ came, the vessel through whom we might receive sonship.<a name=203:4></a> It is more than intelligence, we <i>receive</i> it, that thought; and the same thought applies to the Holy Spirit, so it was that certain disciples at Ephesus in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#19">Acts  19</a>, when asked, had not heard if the Holy Spirit was come; they were babes really.<a name=203:5></a> They had not the full light of Christianity, they were really "under guardians and stewards".<a name=203:6></a> You may say that applies to the Gentiles, but it applies to the Jews, too, as we had this afternoon (the difference between <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#3">Acts  3</a>and <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#14">Acts  14</a>).<a name=203:7></a>

		THE DISTINCTION OF JOHN'S WRITINGS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/1John.htm#5">1 John  5</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=321:1></a> I was thinking today of the distinction that should be drawn between John's writings and the writings of the other evangelists, Matthew, Mark and Luke.<a name=321:2></a> They gave the truth in an orderly way, as it grew out of the Lord's ministry.<a name=321:3></a> Mark was the ministry of the gospel.<a name=321:4></a> It was the ministry in general in Luke.<a name=321:5></a> "The glad tidings" would be the same as the gospel.<a name=321:6></a> John was evidently taken up with the great errors that came in after the gospel was inaugurated.<a name=321:7></a> He deals with the Person of Christ, and in the epistles, the continuance from that; that is, these three epistles and the Revelation.<a name=321:8></a> There were, according to the best information available, several errors as to the Person of Christ.<a name=321:9></a> The other apostles expired, and several errors arose.<a name=321:10></a> It looks as if the Lord had reserved John for such an event.<a name=321:11></a> He says to Peter (<a href="../bible/John.htm#21:22">John  21:22</a>), "If I will that he abide until I come, what is that to thee?<a name=321:12></a> Follow thou me".<a name=321:13></a> So that the Lord evidently had a reserve in view of error arising through the devil's work throughout the first century.<a name=321:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I make these remarks as touching now on John's first epistle.<a name=321:15></a> We can see references to traces of the errors as to the Person of Christ.<a name=321:16></a> They have arisen as a development.<a name=321:17></a> Here we have, not a development, but "That which was from the beginning" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#1:1">1 John  1:1</a>), and stress is laid on the humanity of Christ, "that which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes; that which we contemplated, and our hands handled, concerning the word of life".<a name=321:18></a> Note that it is "that which" not 'He which', a neuter thought, as referring to the Lord's Person.<a name=321:19></a> "That which was from the beginning, that which we have

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The error that arose evidently had to do with the Person of Christ in His humanity.<a name=322:2></a> In the gospel of John it is "In the beginning was the Word" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:1">John  1:1</a>), but here it is, "That which was <i>from</i> the beginning", pointing out the Lord Jesus in His humanity, that is, from the incarnation.<a name=322:3></a> The thought of eternal life runs through to the end of the last chapter, and eternal life is to bring out the Lord's deity.<a name=322:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.H.<a name=322:5></a> In reference to the truth of the Person of Christ, has John in mind to impart to our hearts the substantial character of Christianity?<a name=322:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=322:7></a> 'Substantial' is the word.<a name=322:8></a> A visible thing, which can be seen and handled.<a name=322:9></a> It is remarkable that the Lord Jesus can be seen in that light, especially in view of error which has come down to the present time, from the beginning of Christendom.<a name=322:10></a>
