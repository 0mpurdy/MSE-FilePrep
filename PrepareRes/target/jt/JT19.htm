		B.T.<a name=1:3></a>F.<a name=1:4></a> Would you think that the commencement of the epistle to the Hebrews connects with the scene on the mount of Transfiguration when the Father said: "This is my beloved Son: hear him".<a name=1:5></a> <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#9:7">Mark  9:7</a>?<a name=1:6></a>

		Would you mind giving us some idea of what the object was in this epistle being written?<a name=1:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:13></a> To call out the people of God from an order of things which was about to be judged.<a name=1:14></a> Their safety lay in getting out.<a name=1:15></a> Lot's safety lay in getting out of Sodom; but he had no object presented to his heart.<a name=1:16></a> He was to flee; but the point of this book is to present an object great enough to control the minds and hearts of the saints; so that in going out it should be with no uncertain step.<a name=1:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.B.<a name=1:18></a> I suppose when such an One speaks there is something very definite in view.<a name=1:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:20></a> It is the Speaker first, because it is a principle with God that we are to know <i>who</i> speaks.<a name=1:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.L.<a name=1:22></a> The emphasis at the beginning is that "God .<a name=1:23></a>.<a name=1:24></a>.<a name=1:25></a> has spoken to us in .<a name=1:26></a>.<a name=1:27></a>.<a name=1:28></a> Son".<a name=1:29></a> Does not that suggest that we have come to finality?<a name=1:30></a> No voice to be heard after that.<a name=1:31></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.N.<a name=1:32></a>W.<a name=1:33></a> Is the title of the epistle inspired?<a name=1:34></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=1:35></a> I think not.<a name=1:36></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Has spoken to us in Son".<a name=1:37></a> You will observe the unusual form of the passage -- the article is omitted -- "in Son"; so as to throw into greater relief that the Person Himself is divine -- it is none less than God Himself.<a name=1:38></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.C.<a name=2:1></a>H.<a name=2:2></a> Would it be, in that connection, the reason why the writer of the epistle omitted making any reference to himself?<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:4></a> It is to throw into full evidence the One who is the Speaker.<a name=2:5></a> The writer speaks as one of themselves, "spoken unto <i>us</i>".<a name=2:6></a> He wishes to put all possible emphasis upon what he has in mind, that is, that the One who speaks is none less than God Himself; but, nevertheless, a Man so as to be in direct communication with men.<a name=2:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.L.<a name=2:8></a> I suppose it is only by inference that we understand it to be an epistle to Israel, that is, "God having spoken in .<a name=2:9></a>.<a name=2:10></a>.<a name=2:11></a> many ways formerly to <i>the fathers</i>", now speaks to us in Son.<a name=2:12></a> So the whole framework of the epistle is formed around the Jewish system -- assuming the light of God as known in it.<a name=2:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:14></a> And all is to give force to the word at the end: "Therefore let us go forth to him without the camp", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#13:13">Hebrews  13:13</a>.<a name=2:15></a> If He has acquired a place, through the instruction of this chapter, in our hearts, a certain foundation is laid for the final appeal; because it is that believers should go forth to a Person.<a name=2:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		B.T.<a name=2:17></a>F.<a name=2:18></a> Would you say that attention is called, not only to the voice, but to the gracious Person of the Son?<a name=2:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:20></a> Yes.<a name=2:21></a> As just remarked, in the end of this book you have One to whom to go: "Therefore, let us go forth to <i>him</i>", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#13:13">Hebrews  13:13</a>.<a name=2:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.L.<a name=2:23></a> In chapter 6 the Lord is presented in the thought of a city of refuge; and as the epistle proceeds, the greatness of Christ is opened out as that place of refuge.<a name=2:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.F.<a name=2:25></a>M.<a name=2:26></a> Corresponding with that, is there not a ministry in the epistle to build up what is spiritual -- a spiritual order of man in the people addressed, so that their state toward God was relative to their place outside the camp?<a name=2:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:28></a> So you have a great spiritual system evolved

		in connection with the great Speaker; hence the saints are rendered wholly independent of all human organisations; indeed, it is intended to call the saints out of a system of things which had had divine approval -- there could be nothing better than that on this earth -- but the epistle is intended to set the saints up here independent even of that.<a name=3:1></a> They now have in a spiritual way all that which formerly was suggested in a material way.<a name=3:2></a> As formed by this epistle, there would be a company of people governed by heavenly principles, wholly outside of man's organisation.<a name=3:3></a> So it is directly adapted to our own time.<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.L.<a name=3:5></a> Does it not make a very powerful appeal?<a name=3:6></a> That in which the Hebrew saints found themselves enmeshed, we find our brethren, very generally, enmeshed in like manner.<a name=3:7></a> Whilst the light did originally come from God, <i>now</i> they are entangled and held; so this epistle is very helpful today.<a name=3:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:9></a> If you had lived in Jerusalem in the day in which this epistle was circulated there, and met a Jewish Christian (one who had accepted Christianity but had not definitely left Judaism), he would have said to you: What are you going to do; are you going to withdraw from the temple and all with which we have been going on?<a name=3:10></a> You would have answered: See the Person we have presented to us!<a name=3:11></a> He is the Builder of the universe; "<i>By whom</i> also he made the worlds".<a name=3:12></a> And you would have gone through this chapter and pointed out to him that there could be no lack <i>if we have Him</i>.<a name=3:13></a> And, moreover, He is the great antitype of Solomon.<a name=3:14></a> Solomon built the material structure, but He built the spiritual structure, and we are going in for that.<a name=3:15></a> Indeed, everything they had materially we are going to have spiritually.<a name=3:16></a> It matters not whether we are living in Judaea, Greece, Italy or any other place, <i>we have got Him</i>, and we have a spiritual order of things which

		is going to subsist.<a name=4:1></a> That is how one would have spoken to such an one in that day and, I think, it all applies now.<a name=4:2></a> People do not understand how you can get on without an organisation; therefore, the first great thing is to get an apprehension in your soul of the greatness of the Person who addresses you.<a name=4:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.N.<a name=4:4></a>W.<a name=4:5></a> You spoke of human organisations; but this letter would lead us to see that what was divinely appointed is superseded.<a name=4:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:7></a> Yes.<a name=4:8></a> Stephen says, quoting from the prophet, "Heaven is my throne, and the earth is the footstool of my feet: what house will ye build me?<a name=4:9></a> saith the Lord, or where is the place of my rest?<a name=4:10></a> Has not my hand made all these things?<a name=4:11></a>" <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7:49">Acts  7:49</a>,50.<a name=4:12></a> This epistle says: "He who has built all things is God" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#3:4">Hebrews  3:4</a>); but then, the Builder is the Son.<a name=4:13></a> He who builds the house is greater than the house.<a name=4:14></a> The first thing is to get <i>the greater</i>; that is, the Person.<a name=4:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.L.<a name=4:16></a> So we get: "Consider how great this personage was"; who was "assimilated to the Son of God", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#7:3">Hebrews  7:3</a>,4.<a name=4:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		D.M.<a name=4:18></a>R.<a name=4:19></a> In speaking of the greatness of the Person in this way, would it set forth that He was competent to inaugurate a system according to God?<a name=4:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:21></a> That is what comes out.<a name=4:22></a> This chapter lays the basis for all that.<a name=4:23></a> If you get into your soul the greatness of this Person, then all the other things become simple.<a name=4:24></a> The saints are not going to be left at any disadvantage: they have everything in a spiritual way that others may claim to have in a material way.<a name=4:25></a> But the first thing to be sure about is the Person who is speaking.<a name=4:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=4:27></a>M.<a name=4:28></a> God's system will fill the universe in that way: by whom also He made the universe.<a name=4:29></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:30></a> "The worlds".<a name=4:31></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=4:32></a>M.<a name=4:33></a> The tabernacle system was a picture of this -- the universal system.<a name=4:34></a>

		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:1></a> We have it in a spiritual way.<a name=5:2></a> That is the thing to get hold of.<a name=5:3></a> "By whom also he made the worlds", refers to the universe.<a name=5:4></a> Some of us were recently remarking that there is so little time.<a name=5:5></a> Time is the scarcest thing one knows of.<a name=5:6></a> One who was a great astronomer remarked that the waste of time in teaching music was intolerable to him, although he had been a great musician, because he had begun to see the greatness of the physical universe -- of what God had in a material way; but this is spiritual, and the question with us should be: When shall I get hold of all this?<a name=5:7></a> When you come to this epistle it is the spiritual thing.<a name=5:8></a> As you said, the tabernacle was a pattern of the universal system, and it is for us to explore that.<a name=5:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		D.M.<a name=5:10></a>R.<a name=5:11></a> It brings in the truth of Ephesians; "that ye may be fully able to apprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height; and to know the love of the Christ which surpasses knowledge", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:18">Ephesians  3:18</a>,19.<a name=5:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:13></a> The thing is so vast.<a name=5:14></a> If you look into the universe that now is (of course, one knows very little about it), even with the naked eye, you are lost in the contemplation of it; but think of the spiritual order of things, evolved by the One who built the universe in which we are to have part!<a name=5:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.A.<a name=5:16></a>M.<a name=5:17></a> In the beginning of Leviticus it says: "The Lord .<a name=5:18></a>.<a name=5:19></a>.<a name=5:20></a> spoke .<a name=5:21></a>.<a name=5:22></a>.<a name=5:23></a> out of the tabernacle of the congregation": out of the tabernacle condition of things; but here it is in the Person of the Son, speaking out of the universe.<a name=5:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:25></a> You come to that later.<a name=5:26></a> It is only touched on here, but the expression "the worlds" undoubtedly is the universe.<a name=5:27></a> The tabernacle is a figure of that in a spiritual way; and what one feels is the little time there is to go in for that.<a name=5:28></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		B.T.<a name=5:29></a>F.<a name=5:30></a> Would you say that the chapter shows, in a remarkable way, divine wisdom, by unfolding in

		a peculiar manner the glories of the Son so that souls might be attracted?<a name=6:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:2></a> That is the thought, I am sure.<a name=6:3></a> The first great feature of the epistle is to bring into our souls the knowledge of the Son.<a name=6:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.N.<a name=6:5></a>W.<a name=6:6></a> Is the suggestion of relationship wholly absent from that title, "in Son"?<a name=6:7></a> John's way of putting it is that if you have the Son you have the Father also.<a name=6:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:9></a> Of course, you have the Son here; but inasmuch as the article is omitted, which is usually present in designating the Lord in that way, it is to throw into greater relief the Person as being Himself God; that is, it is God speaking, only in the Person of the Son.<a name=6:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.L.<a name=6:11></a> It refers to Deity here.<a name=6:12></a> God is speaking but "in Son".<a name=6:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.F.<a name=6:14></a>M.<a name=6:15></a> But as Man.<a name=6:16></a> Whilst it is God, it is One in manhood; otherwise the voice would not be intelligible to us.<a name=6:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.L.<a name=6:18></a> The great point here is, He speaks "in Son" -- Deity.<a name=6:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:20></a> The first thing is a divine Person speaking.<a name=6:21></a> He is no less than that.<a name=6:22></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:25></a> It is a form of expression which conveys what we call the universe.<a name=6:26></a> It is not simply the world; but "the worlds", the whole physical system.<a name=6:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.L.<a name=6:28></a> The heavens, the earth and all the families.<a name=6:29></a> In other words, everything that is materially created is embraced in the universe.<a name=6:30></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=7:6></a> Great as the thought of creation is, the next statement is really greater, that is, He is "the effulgence of his glory and the expression of his substance".<a name=7:7></a> The material worlds are in themselves far beyond our apprehension, therefore, that in itself establishes the Lord as divine; but then, "the effulgence of his glory".<a name=7:8></a> Think of that!<a name=7:9></a> Think of the Man on the well of Sychar being that -- the shining out of the glory, the effulgence of God.<a name=7:10></a>

		B.

		Would you not emphasise the importance of listening to the voice of the Spirit?<a name=53:1></a> One is impressed that in the confused state of things existing in Christendom the only possible hope of recovery is to take heed to the present voice of the Holy Spirit: "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2">Revelation  2</a>.<a name=53:2></a> It is what <i>the Spirit</i> says.<a name=53:3></a>

		J.T.<a name=71:3></a> That is the point in John's gospel.<a name=71:4></a> So he says in his first epistle, "he is the true God", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:20">1 John  5:20</a>.<a name=71:5></a> The gospel sets before us that it was God Himself.<a name=71:6></a> "He that hath seen me hath seen the Father", <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:9">John  14:9</a>.<a name=71:7></a> But the position of Aaron as priest comes in, in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#28">Exodus  28</a>, with the thought in view that he should minister unto God in that office.<a name=71:8></a> So in the genealogy given in chapter 6 both Moses and Aaron are connected, "This is that Aaron and Moses", <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#6:26">Exodus  6:26</a>.<a name=71:9></a> But then, it goes beyond that in Aaron's case for we have Eleazar and Phinehas; but nothing is said there about Moses' posterity because Moses is the apostle but the priesthood goes beyond Aaron, so that there is adequate testimony to the extension of that side.<a name=71:10></a> And the last-named son, Phinehas, has the priesthood forever; he secures it because of his personal devoted-ness, and not because of his being Aaron's grandson.<a name=71:11></a> It is said in the book of Judges that he stood before the ark in those days -- days of apostasy -- this one priest stood and supported the testimony; chapter 20:27,28.<a name=71:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.L.<a name=166:4></a> I think so.<a name=166:5></a> We might wonder what purpose the record of these Old Testament saints filled, had they not been assembled in this way; the accumulated light brings forth the fulness of the testimony in Christ.<a name=166:6></a> We see that every working of God had Christ in view.<a name=166:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.F.<a name=166:8></a>M.<a name=166:9></a> Would you say that the chapter is constructive?<a name=166:10></a> You were speaking of there being an outline of the men of faith from the beginning of the Old Testament dispensation, to the end before the Lord came; has the Spirit of God put these men together in moral order?<a name=166:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.L.<a name=166:12></a> I think so; the Spirit of Christ was in them.<a name=166:13></a> It is not only that they did things, as we would say, on the principle of faith, but that they did them under the direct impulse of the Spirit of Christ, as Peter suggests in his first epistle, and so the tracing of the line through would show, that from the outset to the end, in relation to the testimony, God was keeping alive before Him what came out in Christ alone in its fulness.<a name=166:14></a> In that way it was accumulative; what came out in Abel and Enoch was carried on to Noah, and so on right through.<a name=166:15></a>

		W.H.<a name=166:16></a>C.<a name=166:17></a> The scripture speaks of Moses in that respect, that he esteemed "the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt".<a name=166:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		F.L.<a name=167:8></a> So that two prominent things which come out in Christ, righteousness and life, are principles seen in Abel, of whom it is said, "having died, he yet speaks".<a name=167:9></a> He loved the mind of God and he died for that very cause, thus his voice becomes a voice in the power of life.<a name=167:10></a> It is easy to see how those things are connected with Christ.<a name=167:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.L.<a name=167:16></a> I think so.<a name=167:17></a> The clue to the chapter is evidently at the end of the previous one, that while there had been a worldly system in connection with the tabernacle and the like, that is seen not to have been the line on which God worked from the outset.<a name=167:18></a> "The just shall live by faith" <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:38">Hebrews  10:38</a>.<a name=167:19></a> As to faith, the word only occurs once in the Old Testament, but the thing itself was the motive power from the very outset; the light which ever was before them was a new Man in a new sphere, God's Man in the world to come.<a name=167:20></a>

		J.T.<a name=249:1></a> It has already been remarked that a leading distinction between Ezra and Nehemiah is that the former is the setting forth of the sovereign work of God, and the latter faithfulness in man.<a name=249:2></a> It will be observed that the book begins: "The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah".<a name=249:3></a> It begins with Nehemiah, and then it says in chapter 2:10, "When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that <i>there was come a man</i> to seek the welfare of the children of Israel".<a name=249:4></a> Personal faithfulness in Nehemiah is emphasised, and then the faithfulness of others, and I think that it accords with the thought of prophetic service.<a name=249:5></a> The first feature of prophetic service is that God sent the prophets; He arose early to send them, showing His interest in His people, His unfailing love.<a name=249:6></a> The prophets being in accord with Him, there was set out in them a sort of subjective testimony in the midst of the general departure.<a name=249:7></a> You see it particularly in the four major or leading prophets whose writings are preserved, besides the others.<a name=249:8></a> Isaiah had to walk barefoot.<a name=249:9></a> Ezekiel was required to lie on his side three hundred and ninety days to bear the iniquity of Israel, and forty days to bear the iniquity of Judah.<a name=249:10></a> So, under the eve of God, there was a testimony by this prophet to the sin of the whole nation, to the whole course of the iniquity of the nation from its beginning.<a name=249:11></a> He was to bear the iniquity of Israel for three hundred and ninety days, and Judah forty days, that is, a day for a year, so that all of the nation is represented by him there.<a name=249:12></a> He is a type of the Lord, who bore the guilt of the nation from the outset.<a name=249:13></a> In Stephen's address

		But his first letter had the effect of reduction; it brought about self-judgment, and so he is now able to say in the second epistle, "our mouth is open to you, our heart is expanded .<a name=313:10></a>.<a name=313:11></a>.<a name=313:12></a> for an answering recompense let your heart also expand itself.<a name=313:13></a> Be not diversely yoked with unbelievers", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#6:11">2 Corinthians  6:11</a> - 14.<a name=313:14></a> And he proceeds, until in chapter 12 he arrives at the thought of a man in Christ: "I know a man in Christ", (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#12:2">2 Corinthians  12:2</a>) he says.<a name=313:15></a> That leads to the expansion that he had before him, which corresponds with this chapter.<a name=313:16></a> "Such an one caught up to the third heaven.<a name=313:17></a> And I know such a man .<a name=313:18></a>.<a name=313:19></a>.<a name=313:20></a> caught up into Paradise", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#12:2">2 Corinthians  12:2</a> - 4.<a name=313:21></a> But before being caught up into Paradise he had been let down by night in a basket through the wall; so that he himself had gone though a most humiliating process.<a name=313:22></a> And I think all that accords with what we had in the earlier chapters of this book as regards Joshua being Moses' attendant, and the bringing in

		J.T.<a name=332:5></a> The great combination in chapter 11 continues the conflict, and Joshua is victorious.<a name=332:6></a> All this opposition corresponds, I think, with Saul continuing to breathe out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord.<a name=332:7></a> Neither Saul nor the elders at Jerusalem had reckoned on Christ being in heaven, nor that He was entrusted with the authority of God.<a name=332:8></a> The overwhelming power of God was now in the hands of a Man, and who could cope with that!<a name=332:9></a> So with Joshua here; in the tenth chapter the five kings were brought down, and not only is Joshua victorious, but Satan, so to speak, is bruised under his feet.<a name=332:10></a> The epistle to the Romans contemplates that Satan shall be bruised under our feet shortly, but Ephesians, I think, contemplates that this is already done.<a name=332:11></a>

		J.T.<a name=344:1></a> I may remark, for those who were not here, that our exercise this morning involved the consideration of <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9">Acts  9</a>, as fitting in with the place that man has in the tenth chapter of this book.<a name=344:2></a> That is to say, the Lord spoke <i>out of heaven</i> to Saul, as <i>Jesus</i>.<a name=344:3></a> The centre of influence henceforth would be from heaven.<a name=344:4></a> And in connection with that there is the authority of the Lord in subduing that which is adverse to Him.<a name=344:5></a> Then we are told that the assemblies had peace and were edified, and walking in the fear of the Lord, were increased through the comfort of the Holy Spirit.<a name=344:6></a>

		And then it was shown from <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13">Acts  13</a>, which corresponded, I thought, with the eighteenth chapter of this book, that after the tribes of Judah and Joseph obtained their inheritance, the dispositions of God for the remaining tribes were made in the house or assembly, i.<a name=344:7></a>e.<a name=344:8></a>, the assembly as come together at Shiloh had set up the tent of meeting there, and the remaining seven tribes obtained their inheritance in that connection.<a name=344:9></a> The twelve apostles had received their commission and spheres of influence direct from the Lord, corresponding with Judah and Joseph.<a name=344:10></a> Whereas, Paul and Barnabas received their commission and work from <i>the Spirit in the assembly</i>.<a name=344:11></a> "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13:2">Acts  13:2</a>.<a name=344:12></a> The assembly was thus the sphere where God intimated His mind, and made His dispositions.<a name=344:13></a> And then we see in the eighteenth and nineteenth chapters, how the tribes which obtain the inheritance under this principle are set in relation to one another; and they became tests to each other.<a name=344:14></a>

		I have in mind to speak a little about the glory, a subject obviously of vast proportions, and consequently, you can understand that one of my difficulties will be to limit myself and present something concise in regard to it.<a name=409:1></a> The gospel of John speaks more of glory than either Matthew, Mark, or Luke; and for the very obvious reason that in it we are introduced into the presence of divine Persons revealed in their relations to each other; indeed John presents what we might designate as the rights of God in love.<a name=409:2></a> Matthew presents to us the rights of God in government, and Mark the rights of God in service; Luke presents to us the rights of God in grace; but it was reserved for John to present to us in his inimitable way the rights of God in love.<a name=409:3></a> God had a right to love; and, in the exercise of that right, He came in, in the Son, and hence the wonderful variety in the display of glory.<a name=409:4></a> So we are in the presence, in this narrative, of a wonderfully varied display of glory.<a name=409:5></a>

		J.T.<a name=432:3></a> Yes; "Drink ye all of it" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#26:27">Matthew  26:27</a>), the Lord said, speaking of the cup; and in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10">1 Corinthians  10</a>it says: "we all partake of that one loaf" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10:17">1 Corinthians  10:17</a>); "we, being many are one loaf, one body", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10:17">1 Corinthians  10:17</a>.<a name=432:4></a> But what he is dealing with here is order, so he says, "For <i>I</i> received from the Lord <i>that which</i> I also delivered to you".<a name=432:5></a> He alludes to the thing that he had delivered and the order in which he had set it up among them.<a name=432:6></a>

		J.T.<a name=432:13></a> Yes; according to Luke.<a name=432:14></a> What is to be observed in the gospels in regard of the order is that Luke tells us that the thought of preparation originated with the Lord Himself, and He sent Peter and John to prepare.<a name=432:15></a> While Matthew and Mark tell us that the suggestion as to where the preparation should take place arose with the disciples, Luke would emphasise that the Lord is concerned about it, that He did not leave it to them.<a name=432:16></a> I think that as to the order in which the supper is commonly celebrated, the thing has been taken out of the Lord's hands; I do not say among ourselves as walking in the truth to some extent, but in a general way the thing has been taken out of his hands.<a name=432:17></a> Men have done what they pleased with it.<a name=432:18></a> You see the gross extent to which men would go with it in the church of Rome, and in other denominations.<a name=432:19></a> In almost every one of them the matter is taken out of the Lord's hands, and all kinds of additions are introduced, so that it is not discernible at all, whatever they may call it.<a name=432:20></a>

		J.T.<a name=433:3></a> I think so; the Lord made His own selection.<a name=433:4></a> Peter refers to the government of the assembly.<a name=433:5></a> He had the keys of the kingdom, and the Acts show that he took the lead in matters, whereas John refers more to family affections.<a name=433:6></a> But the order comes first; before you can have family affections you must have order; hence it says: "He maketh the barren woman to keep house" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#113:9">Psalm  113:9</a>) (that is Peter's line), "as a joyful mother of sons", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#113:9">Psalm  113:9</a>.<a name=433:7></a> Children come in when the house is in order, and with joy; she is a joyful mother of children, for the assembly should be that.<a name=433:8></a> It should be a place of holy joy, but it should be in connection with order.<a name=433:9></a>

		J.T.<a name=438:29></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>there is an indication of spiritual periods; you have the first day of the week and then "eight days after", <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:26">John  20:26</a>.<a name=438:30></a> I think that is a plain indication of assembly experience.<a name=438:31></a>
