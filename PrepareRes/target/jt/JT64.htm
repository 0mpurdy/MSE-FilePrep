		J.T.<a name=1:2></a> The thought in mind is that of pouring out, as seen in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#25:29">Exodus  25:29</a>.<a name=1:3></a> In this chapter, verses 23 to 30, we have the table of shewbread and the vessels of service attached to it for the service of pouring out.<a name=1:4></a> In <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#22:23">Isaiah  22:23</a>, 24 we have a detailed reference to vessels of service; "small vessels, as well the vessels of cups as all the vessels of flagons".<a name=1:5></a> The verses in Isaiah help to show how all are to be in the service of God.<a name=1:6></a> Each vessel represents a person who should function in his place.<a name=1:7></a> The table in the sanctuary in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#25">Exodus  25</a>affords a basis to speak of administration in relation to these vessels, however it may be in the Lord's mind to use us.<a name=1:8></a> The idea of pouring out is the general thought in regard of the vessels, as it is said in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#25">Exodus  25</a>, "And thou shalt make the dishes thereof, and cups thereof, and goblets thereof, and bowls thereof, with which to pour out".<a name=1:9></a> In Titus Paul says, "The Holy Spirit, which he poured out on us richly".<a name=1:10></a> So the thought of pouring out is linked with the Holy Spirit given by Christ from heaven and then administered by Him in the assembly.<a name=1:11></a> The result intended is that each person, being dependent on Christ, should function according to the Lord's pleasure and so be available for divine service in the assembly whether in relation to Himself, or the Father.<a name=1:12></a> The service of God is not an empty form, not mere ritual, but is worked out livingly through persons viewed as vessels, whatever they may have, or whatever use the Lord may make of them.<a name=1:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:4></a> Again it refers to persons.<a name=2:5></a> It typifies the saints viewed administratively.<a name=2:6></a> In Exodus it is viewed as 'the bread of the presence'; it is bread or food, always there before God.<a name=2:7></a> That is the general thought in the type.<a name=2:8></a>

		P.L.<a name=2:9></a> In <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#26">Matthew  26</a>, Mary, having broken the box of very precious ointment, poured it out on His head, as He lay at table.<a name=2:10></a> There was the pouring out.<a name=2:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:12></a> Yes.<a name=2:13></a> The Lord said, "In pouring out this ointment on my body, she has done it for my burying".<a name=2:14></a> Mary of Bethany was a very distinctive vessel.<a name=2:15></a> We have another vessel in the woman of Samaria in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>, who came out of the city with her water-pot, and left it after the Lord had met and instructed her as to living water.<a name=2:16></a> As a result she arrived at the idea of belonging to that system and functioning, being useful in it.<a name=2:17></a> In <a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#17">1 Kings  17</a>we have another, the woman of Sarepta, who had things in her house <i>in vessels</i>; the meal was in a barrel and the oil in a cruse.<a name=2:18></a> That was where they should be and they were therefore usable, and so she was serviceable to Elijah as a type of Christ.<a name=2:19></a> Jehovah says He had commanded her to maintain Elijah and she did.<a name=2:20></a> He had been served by ravens before, but now this woman was to care for him.<a name=2:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		W.O.<a name=2:22></a>S.<a name=2:23></a> Paul speaks of himself as being poured out as a libation in a sacrificial service (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:17">Philippians  2:17</a>).<a name=2:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=2:25></a> Yes.<a name=2:26></a> He was something that could be added to the sacrifice and ministration of the Philippians.<a name=2:27></a> We should be ready thus to add to whatever is going on that is of God.<a name=2:28></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:4></a> Yes.<a name=3:5></a> The gold is not in us naturally.<a name=3:6></a> All begins with Christ and every vessel hangs on Him.<a name=3:7></a> It begins with Him, but does not end with Him.<a name=3:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		H.W.<a name=3:9></a>R.<a name=3:10></a> There were different sizes of cups and vessels, so we would each have our own measure.<a name=3:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:12></a> It is not a one-man ministry; each believer is a vessel.<a name=3:13></a> Paul, speaking of his measure, says to the Corinthians that it was "to reach to you".<a name=3:14></a> He did not serve beyond his measure, but effectively through the power of his ministry.<a name=3:15></a> It was not going a journey to preach.<a name=3:16></a> Divine measures are exact, whatever they are in view of; this is specially seen in Exodus.<a name=3:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		H.W.<a name=3:18></a> The Lord as Minister of the sanctuary has all the vessels under His hand and knows the measure of each.<a name=3:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=3:20></a> Yes.<a name=3:21></a> Exodus is typical of what we have in mind, the true tabernacle which the Lord has pitched and not man, and all the vessels are His.<a name=3:22></a> In Genesis all service to God is without direction from God, but in Exodus all is measured.<a name=3:23></a>

		J.T.<a name=3:31></a> The prophet was directed to make known what Jehovah would do.<a name=3:32></a> There was one to be removed so that way might be made for Christ; Eliakim typifies Him.<a name=3:33></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:1></a> It is a question of God's thoughts.<a name=4:2></a> In creation itself He must have wrought on the principle of <i>weight</i> and <i>measure</i>, and so likewise in Exodus God does not leave things indefinite in His service.<a name=4:3></a> Things are not left open for anyone to do as he pleases.<a name=4:4></a> All is to be according to God's mind.<a name=4:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		H.W.<a name=4:6></a>R.<a name=4:7></a> God is a God of measure, as seen in <a href="../bible/Job.htm#28:25">Job  28:25</a>; <a href="../bible/Job.htm#38:5">Job  38:5</a>.<a name=4:8></a>

		J.T.<a name=4:9></a> Yes.<a name=4:10></a> Nothing is left open to be decided by man's mind.<a name=4:11></a> Christendom is simply a monstrosity from the divine standpoint, as things are carried on according to human standards.<a name=4:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.M.<a name=4:13></a> The vessels are of pure gold.<a name=4:14></a> We are to accustom ourselves to regard the saints as God sees us, "holy and blameless before him in love", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:4">Ephesians  1:4</a>.<a name=4:15></a> There is no admixture.<a name=4:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:17></a> There is no admixture, but there is to be no isolation because of variation of measure.<a name=4:18></a> It is not dependent on man's mind, but on God's mind.<a name=4:19></a> The Lord Jesus is in God's mind in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#22">Isaiah  22</a>and all is to hang on Him.<a name=4:20></a> The Christ is the One who does things.<a name=4:21></a> The Lord in <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#8">Mark  8</a>asks His disciples, "Who do men say that I am?<a name=4:22></a>" Peter answers for the disciples and says that they would say "<i>Thou</i> art the Christ".<a name=4:23></a> Previously it had been said that "He does all things well".<a name=4:24></a> When there is something out of order with us such as failure in speech, as the man in <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#7">Mark  7</a>"who could not speak right", we are to think of the Lord's feelings.<a name=4:25></a> "He groaned".<a name=4:26></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=4:29></a> It refers to the action of Christ in using the saints.<a name=4:30></a> He is the great Superintendent of all in the service of God, so that all is done perfectly and right.<a name=4:31></a> When the service proceeds, we all have pleasure in it as under the hand of the Lord.<a name=4:32></a>

		J.T.<a name=5:1></a> In singing the sisters' voices afford them an outlet, and possibly they use their voices better than brothers.<a name=5:2></a> They are instruments of music, "which I made", said David -- none should be silent.<a name=5:3></a>

		J.T.<a name=5:6></a> Yet the <i>person</i> is being used; there is great need of usability as in the divine system.<a name=5:7></a> We are not to be silent.<a name=5:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.G.<a name=5:9></a> The cup at the Lord's supper has a stimulating effect in connection with the pouring out.<a name=5:10></a> In Corinthians we are all made to drink into one Spirit.<a name=5:11></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>the Lord directed the woman of Samaria; He gives the water, but it has to be drunk.<a name=5:12></a> We often sing 'One spirit, glorious Lord' as we are stimulated by His love.<a name=5:13></a> The cup is an allusion to the Spirit.<a name=5:14></a>

		C.M.<a name=5:15></a>M.<a name=5:16></a> What would be the meaning of the four different kinds of vessels referred to in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#25">Exodus  25</a>, the cups, dishes, goblets, bowls?<a name=5:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:18></a> It is a question of variety, such as should be seen in the assembly.<a name=5:19></a> There is resemblance with us all, as being according to the grace given by Him, like Christ, but there is variety; all are made of gold.<a name=5:20></a> The use of gold alludes to the state of righteousness before God.<a name=5:21></a>

		W.O.<a name=5:22></a>S.<a name=5:23></a> All are made serviceable for pouring out.<a name=5:24></a> David's mighty men brought the water to David and he poured it out before the Lord.<a name=5:25></a> No vessels are mentioned there (<a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#11:17">1 Chronicles  11:17</a> - 19).<a name=5:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=5:27></a> Yes.<a name=5:28></a> The water poured out represented those three men, what they were before God.<a name=5:29></a> They sacrificed their lives for David.<a name=5:30></a> His action showed how he viewed it and hence their place among the mighty.<a name=5:31></a>

		<a name=6>[Page 6]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:1></a> The whole tabernacle was portable.<a name=6:2></a> We have to do with the true tabernacle which the Lord has pitched and not man, but things are portable now.<a name=6:3></a> The wilderness position is always movable, and we are to be ready to move, we are not to be stationary.<a name=6:4></a> Solomon's system involved what was stationary and suggested millennial conditions.<a name=6:5></a> It was a fixed matter, but not so under Moses; everything then was movable.<a name=6:6></a> It was a question of vessels for pouring out, the kind that had to be made, and were made in perfect order.<a name=6:7></a> The waggons in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#7">Numbers  7</a>teach us that all these things had to be moved.<a name=6:8></a> If they were heavy, the Levites who carried them had waggons.<a name=6:9></a> Certain Levites carried the boards and the coverings, which were heavy things, so they had waggons, but the Kohathites had no waggons.<a name=6:10></a> The precious things, the golden things, which point to Christ or the things that are like Christ or of Christ, were carried by the Kohathites on their shoulders, and that is why they were provided with staves; they were for them, that their burdens might be carried on their shoulders.<a name=6:11></a> I think it suggests for us what is most valuable, hence what needs to be most protected.<a name=6:12></a>

		J.H.<a name=6:13></a>H.<a name=6:14></a> Is it in any way linked with <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21">Revelation  21</a>, "the tabernacle of God is with men"?<a name=6:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=6:16></a> I think that shows that it is not the Solomonic character of things in Revelation, but the Davidic.<a name=6:17></a> David is in the mind of the Spirit in Revelation.<a name=6:18></a> He is alluded to in what we read in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#22">Isaiah  22</a>.<a name=6:19></a> It appears that Revelation is in mind, therefore in the address to Philadelphia mention is made of the key of David.<a name=6:20></a> Then again in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22">Revelation  22</a>Christ is said to be the Root and Offspring of David.<a name=6:21></a> So that Revelation has in mind the tabernacle idea, I would say that it is the movable thought, and I suppose our position in heaven eternally will be a movable one.<a name=6:22></a> We shall not be fixed.<a name=6:23></a>

		J.T.<a name=7:4></a> Quite so.<a name=7:5></a> The gospel of John contemplates 'the hind of the morning', corresponding with the title of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>.<a name=7:6></a> All that you speak of is involved in the service of God as we are now speaking of it.<a name=7:7></a> The feminine thought is seen in the beginning of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>.<a name=7:8></a> Mary of Magdalene would be a suggestion of the hind of the morning, and what the feminine thought as taken on by the saints, is for Christ.<a name=7:9></a> There is agility as we were saying; flexibility and agility, both the result of our being affected by Christ Himself.<a name=7:10></a> Things are done in an orderly sense, but done quickly with agility, so that the most possible is procured for God.<a name=7:11></a>

		J.T.<a name=27:1></a> The Lord has been calling attention to the epistles to Corinth, and it is thought that we should have something to say while together at these meetings as to them.<a name=27:2></a> The local idea attaches to the first epistle, hence it begins, "Paul, a called apostle of Jesus Christ, by God's will, and Sosthenes the brother, to the assembly of God which is in Corinth".<a name=27:3></a> Attention is here called to the fact that it is to the assembly of God which is in Corinth; that is to say, the assembly of God in a locality is addressed.<a name=27:4></a> It is the local character of the assembly.<a name=27:5></a> Following that attention is to be called to what is said in chapter 14, verse 23, where the whole assembly is spoken of as coming together in one place.<a name=27:6></a> We have before us in that the thought of the local assembly, even although there might be a hundred gatherings in the assembly in that city, or fifty, or twenty-five.<a name=27:7></a> The local idea is still stressed, although in chapter 14 emphasis is laid upon the <i>whole</i> assembly in the locality coming together, however many or few, for ministry.<a name=27:8></a> They come together at the same time and place.<a name=27:9></a>

		Then it is thought that we should see that the first nine verses of our chapter have an abstract character, that is to say, the saints at Corinth as viewed abstractly as being possessed of certain things, as it says, "I thank my God always about you, in respect of the grace of God given to you in Christ Jesus; that in everything ye have been enriched in him, in all word of doctrine, and all knowledge, (according as the testimony of the Christ has been confirmed in you), so that ye come short in no gift, awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ".<a name=28:1></a> That is what has to be called abstract, because the Corinthian saints were not actually as intelligent as is said here.<a name=28:2></a> You would almost assume that there was nothing at all missing, but it was not so.<a name=28:3></a> These are abstract thoughts, and God is speaking through the apostle of the truth in this epistle from His own point of view, and telling the Corinthians that there is nothing left out from His point of view, and it is a question of their finding it out in due time.<a name=28:4></a> Two epistles are written, so that the saints should know everything required to furnish them in their local position as God's assembly.<a name=28:5></a> That is why it has to be called abstract, because <i>everything</i> was not really true of the Corinthians in the fullest sense; they had to be taught.<a name=28:6></a> That is what I thought ought to be before our minds, so that we might see what God has in His mind for us in view of what is available in the assembly for the general service of God.<a name=28:7></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=42:1></a> It is thought that we should read the third chapter with a view to speaking of the temple, but also touch on chapter 2.<a name=42:2></a> In these epistles to Corinth there is much allusion to Paul himself, to his ministry and to himself generally.<a name=42:3></a> It is to be noted because it indicates that he was intended to be a model.<a name=42:4></a> We mentioned yesterday that the book of Exodus has in it a suggestion of <i>the pattern</i>, and there was to be no deviation from that pattern.<a name=42:5></a> It is thought that the apostle Paul, like the Lord Jesus, is an example of everything as Paul himself says, "Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ", chapter 11: 1.<a name=42:6></a> Paul is not excluding Christ from the idea of pattern, yet Paul, a creature like ourselves, is intended to represent the mind of God in ministry, as well as being an example of christianity or christians.<a name=42:7></a> According to Genesis, at that time in the history of man, the speakers, or servants of God were generally left free as to what they might say or do, but in Exodus God is very particular as to pattern, and Moses was responsible as to the pattern, the pattern of the tabernacle shown him on the mount.<a name=42:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in view of all this, chapter 2 says "And <i>I</i>, when I came to you, brethren, came not in excellency of word, or wisdom, announcing to you the testimony of God.<a name=42:9></a> For I did not judge it well to know anything among you save Jesus Christ, and <i>him</i> crucified.<a name=42:10></a> And <i>I</i> was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling; and my word and my preaching, not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power; that your faith might not stand in men's wisdom, but in God's power".<a name=42:11></a> The apostle thus shows us the example

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=43:8></a> Very good.<a name=43:9></a> There is an economy, although it has been sadly departed from; in fact, we might say that the thought of it is given up in general amongst the professing people of God.<a name=43:10></a> It is, therefore, all the more needed that those of us who would walk in the truth and follow the Lord as Paul did, should be guided by the example that has been spoken of, the example that Paul sets before us, as he said, "Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ".<a name=43:11></a> So that Christ is still the example here, only He is to be apprehended through Paul.<a name=43:12></a> The Lord speaks of him as "an elect vessel to me", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:15">Acts  9:15</a>.<a name=43:13></a> He had been selected by the Lord for this very purpose, not simply that he should be a christian, but that he should be an example to all christians in regard to the teaching and principles governing christianity and the assembly.<a name=43:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=97:1></a> Certain features of truth have been stressed amongst the saints during the last year or two; if not here, elsewhere, but I believe here too, and one is this matter of the collection, to use the language of <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#16">1 Corinthians  16</a>, the collections for the saints.<a name=97:2></a> The brethren in this country are apparently acting on the same principles as elsewhere; but not perhaps in certain details, and I thought it would be wise to call attention to this.<a name=97:3></a> It may be remarked that the thought came before us in the expression in first Timothy, "Let not the assembly be charged" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#5:16">1 Timothy  5:16</a>); that is to say, certain charges, though rightly called for in meeting obligations amongst us, are not to be charged against the assembly; they are not to be provided for and met by way of our collections in connection with the Lord's supper.<a name=97:4></a> Our collections otherwise are not in question; the matter stands relative to the Lord's supper and what is connected with it as to the assembly.<a name=97:5></a> It has been suggested that charges incurred in relation to certain meetings that are held, generally of a large size, for the special purpose of disseminating the truth in a constructive way, should be provided for in our collections at the Lord's supper.<a name=97:6></a> What is in mind in these special meetings has reference to the truth as to the assembly rendered in testimony.<a name=97:7></a> It has been thought therefore that it is quite in order that the assembly should be chargeable for these three-day meetings for inquiry and instruction in the truth, such as have been held recently in Glasgow and London and are later to be held, if the Lord will, in Sydney, because the testimony, that is to say the ministry, is particularly in mind, not exactly the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.J.<a name=98:3></a>F.<a name=98:4></a> Would this gathering here during the last few days come in that same category?<a name=98:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=98:6></a> That is what I think, and I believe the brethren here do, too, because these meetings are expressly for the ministry of the truth relative to the assembly.<a name=98:7></a> The assembly is said by the apostle Paul, speaking in the power of the Spirit, to be "the pillar and base of the truth".<a name=98:8></a> The assembly is that, and therefore gatherings that take that character are rightly provided for from the collection at the Lord's supper.<a name=98:9></a>

		J.R.<a name=98:10></a>v.<a name=98:11></a>N.<a name=98:12></a> And now as to food, where there is temporal need among the saints, where do you fit that in?<a name=98:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=98:14></a> That is a question for the brethren who have to deal with that matter to decide; what does the meeting of <i>need</i> mean.<a name=98:15></a> It is not in Scripture regarded as the supplementing of what is already provided.<a name=98:16></a> The word <i>need</i> ought to be understood according to Scripture.<a name=98:17></a> In James and John's first epistle, it is in mind, and in these epistles to Corinth.<a name=98:18></a> The word in John's epistle is, "whoso .<a name=98:19></a>.<a name=98:20></a>.<a name=98:21></a> seeth his brother have need", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:17">1 John  3:17</a>; that is the expression.<a name=98:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.J.<a name=98:23></a>D.<a name=98:24></a> Our attention has been drawn to <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#8:14">2 Corinthians  8:14</a>, "But on the principle of equality; in the present time your abundance for their lack, that their abundance may be for your lack, so that there should be equality".<a name=98:25></a> The word 'lack' has been referred to in this way as over against 'need'.<a name=98:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=98:27></a> Well I think the word 'lack' in the scripture is to be understood as implying need, because the collection in mind was for Jerusalem, for the <i>poor</i>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=99:8></a> Yes.<a name=99:9></a> Such meetings as have been held, as remarked, in London and Glasgow and are intended to be held in Sydney; they are general meetings specifically for the development of the truth in a ministerial sense.<a name=99:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=99:13></a> Quite so.<a name=99:14></a> The thought is the importance of the truth, the ministry, and the time needed for it.<a name=99:15></a> It is considered that three days is a period well authenticated in Scripture.<a name=99:16></a> The idea of 'three' is well established in Scripture.<a name=99:17></a>

		R.L.<a name=99:18></a> In the meetings to which you refer, would it be in order to have a collection such as has been arranged here to meet the charge of these meetings?<a name=99:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=99:20></a> Yes.<a name=99:21></a> They have in mind the testimony and the ministry supporting it.<a name=99:22></a> Paul uses the word ministry, saying "that the ministry be not blamed" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#6:3">2 Corinthians  6:3</a>); the word 'ministry' is understood in that sense.<a name=99:23></a>

		they have in mind rather the spiritual needs of <i>those present</i>.<a name=100:1></a> It has been a practice sometimes for these week-end meetings for the fares of children and families, including perhaps unconverted people, to be paid, and all that has been made a charge on the assembly.<a name=100:2></a> All this bears on what we are saying now, "Let not the assembly be charged" as spoken of in <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#5">1 Timothy  5</a>, and the brethren would be wise if they were to look carefully at the facts of that chapter, seeing how the assembly is carefully guarded against unnecessary charges.<a name=100:3></a> It is not that the money is not plentiful in order to pay anything of that kind, but the apostle's word is to bring out the dignity of the assembly.<a name=100:4></a> The assembly is not an ordinary human society, it is an exceptional thing, the greatest family in the universe really, and it is so treated in Scripture, a family of firstborn ones, so that its dignity should be maintained in all these matters.<a name=100:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		P.L.<a name=100:6></a> The local occasions you allude to would furnish opportunity for the expenses to be defrayed by a collection on the spot.<a name=100:7></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=100:13></a> Well I see that, but what is to be said firstly is.<a name=100:14></a> Great Britain is not starved, as we speak; it is not like Germany; the rations are enough to keep people alive, so that it is not really a question of need in the full scriptural sense in Great Britain.<a name=100:15></a> The actual facts would show that.<a name=100:16></a> If brethren are free to send parcels to Great Britain, good and well, to supplement what they already have, to increase their food, but the point now in question is whether there is real <i>need</i> and so whether the cost of such parcels is <i>chargeable to the assembly</i>.<a name=100:17></a> Then as regards Germany and other nations in Europe, the question
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=101>[Page 101]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		is, To whom are we sending the food?<a name=101:1></a> Are they real christians, are they walking in the truth?<a name=101:2></a> You cannot always be sure, because we do not know all the facts.<a name=101:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.S.<a name=101:4></a>S.<a name=101:5></a> To refer to facts for a moment, the parcels are being sent from Great Britain to Germany, and are being distributed amongst the households of our brethren.<a name=101:6></a> These parcels are being paid for by brethren individually, although the letters which have been received in acknowledgment indicate considerable need.<a name=101:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=101:8></a> In Germany I would say there is considerable need, and perhaps there is need in England, but I do not know of such need in the sense of which we are speaking.<a name=101:9></a> While there may be considerable need in Germany, the question arises whether the persons that get the food are all in the testimony as we might say.<a name=101:10></a> Of course, we are right individually in meeting need if we can, wherever it may exist, but are we right in using the collections in the assembly to meet general need?<a name=101:11></a> We are dealing now with a very remarkable truth and I believe it has been somewhat ignored.<a name=101:12></a> The phrase "Let not the assembly be charged" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#5:16">1 Timothy  5:16</a>) used by the apostle Paul has to be specially noticed.<a name=101:13></a> He speaks of "widows indeed" and then he says of them that if they have descendants, let their descendants look after them.<a name=101:14></a> They are real widows and they are in need, but the descendants are to look after them.<a name=101:15></a> That is what Scripture says, and then again there was evidently a <i>list</i> that should be used, and it is in regard to a widow.<a name=101:16></a> She was not to be less than sixty years of age.<a name=101:17></a> Well that is a remarkable thing.<a name=101:18></a> Why should that be?<a name=101:19></a> We have to stop and think.<a name=101:20></a> Does it agree with the assembly, the dignity of the assembly?<a name=101:21></a> This widow is to be so and so.<a name=101:22></a> She had to be marked by washing the saints' feet; she has had to be the wife of one man; and several

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.M.<a name=102:4></a> Has not christendom become taken up a great deal with good works and public philanthropy, like Dorcas?<a name=102:5></a> Is not the assembly to be elevated above that in our minds?<a name=102:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=102:7></a> Yes.<a name=102:8></a> The persons that were taken up with the work of Dorcas were greatly distressed when she died, but Peter put them all out.<a name=102:9></a> That is a very solemn thing, that people have to be put out, and it is the idea of elimination that matters.<a name=102:10></a> Although these widows were benefiting from Dorcas, they were put out by Peter.<a name=102:11></a> It was a matter of spirituality that led him to do that.<a name=102:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		W.S.<a name=102:13></a>S.<a name=102:14></a> I have been struck with the words used in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#16">1 Corinthians  16</a>and <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#9">2 Corinthians  9</a>; the apostle says, "Now concerning the collection for the saints" in the first epistle, and "For concerning the ministration which is for the saints" in the second epistle.<a name=102:15></a> Is that the thought to be emphasised, "for the saints"?<a name=102:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=102:17></a> That is just it.<a name=102:18></a> It is a question of the saints, and the word 'poor' is attached to them in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#15">Romans  15</a>.<a name=102:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=102:23></a> The persons who are doing the thing are the best judges as before God of what should be done.<a name=102:24></a> Of course, if it is a brother or a family that are known to have need, it would be right to use the box, because it is for that purpose; only let us be sure of having the intelligence needed to govern the matter.<a name=102:25></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=103:6></a> I can understand that you do not send to England from the box, because, as I have been remarking, that as far as I know, and I have been there recently, they are not in need as Scripture speaks of it.<a name=103:7></a>

		J.W.<a name=103:16></a> I think that some years ago you said that need ought to be met, indeed would have to be met.<a name=103:17></a> Now if there is no <i>need</i> in a scriptural sense among our brethren in England, then the bounty would be sent from individuals.<a name=103:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=103:19></a> Well, that is right.<a name=103:20></a> When a person gives he gives what he pleases, so to speak.<a name=103:21></a> The Lord loves a cheerful giver, but then we are dealing with a specific thing, you know, that is, the assembly and the dignity that belongs to it.<a name=103:22></a> It is not a common thing at all, it is dignified.<a name=103:23></a> And the facts stated in <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#5">1 Timothy  5</a>will indicate that, if the brethren will look into it.<a name=103:24></a>

		I have elected to read from Matthew because it speaks of the very thing that I have before me.<a name=107:3></a> In chapter 15 he speaks about one who has no distinction at all as to generation, but is referred to by the Lord indirectly, or we might even say directly, as a dog.<a name=107:4></a> The word thus used in a spiritual sense, shows that the gentiles were in His mind according to their discreditable histories.<a name=107:5></a> It is not my purpose to enter into the negative side of the human race, but one might speak of the Asiatic race as peculiarly discreditable.<a name=107:6></a> Israel, it is true, was derived from an Asiatic, that is to say, from Abraham himself; but God took account of Abraham as of one who was creditable.<a name=107:7></a> He called him alone, as Isaiah tells us, "I called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him", <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#51:2">Isaiah  51:2</a>.<a name=107:8></a> He never said that of any other.<a name=107:9></a> Later Jacob was blessed, Isaac was blessed, and the twelve tribes were blessed.<a name=107:10></a> The children of Israel were blessed, for God intended to work out His thoughts in the continuing generations through them, and to this end He called Abraham alone and blessed him.<a name=107:11></a> We have to take note of the nations of Asia when we think of Abraham being called alone.<a name=107:12></a>

		In reading these Scriptures, judging that three should be sufficient for such ministry, I have in mind to speak about prayer.<a name=115:1></a> It is a very wide subject, and therefore I do not intend to attempt to cover the ground indicated by the word, but rather to look at specific prayers, which I apprehend should mark us.<a name=115:2></a> We are apt to say prayers, formal prayers, and to limit ourselves to them.<a name=115:3></a> God does not grow weary of prayers, even although they be repeated; at the same time I apprehend that He looks for variety in our prayers, and that He looks for sympathy with Himself in our prayers.<a name=115:4></a> The exercises entering into prayer and the service of God are many and varied, so that fresh thoughts are in order in our prayers.<a name=115:5></a> I only need to recite Solomon's prayer to indicate how varied prayers may be.<a name=115:6></a> It was a very long prayer, but I do not at all advocate long prayers in public, audible prayers, but prefer brief ones covering what may be urgent at any given time, and as covering what is urgent our prayers should include current events in the whole world, current happenings in it.<a name=115:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I turn to Mark, although seeing it was the subject of prayer it might be thought that I should turn to Luke, because Luke is more priestly, if I may say so.<a name=115:8></a> He affords us more detailed instruction as to prayer than any of the evangelists; in fact he is the one, and the one only, who tells us of the disciples who asked the Lord to teach <i>them</i> to pray.<a name=115:9></a> We are told in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#11">Luke  11</a>that the Lord was praying in a certain place.<a name=115:10></a> This is quite in keeping with general scriptural facts, that prayer should be at a certain place or certain places, and so it is that the brethren with whom we are walking together have on our

		I cite these matters, because they are actual examples, and it is always important in ministry to base what one says on Scripture.<a name=116:5></a> Every Scripture is inspired of God and is profitable, and now as I am speaking about prayer, Scripture certainly is profitable for our instruction as to prayer.<a name=116:6></a> So Philippi is noted in that sense, and we get a word by Luke again in the book of Acts, that a certain man of Macedonia was heard by Paul in a vision to say, "Come over into Macedonia, and help us", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16:9">Acts  16:9</a>.<a name=116:7></a> We cannot say what the 'us' covers, but it is what I would call a prophetic voice in prayer, and one to be examined and followed.<a name=116:8></a> If here in Durban there is need in any particular way, and it may be there is need of help in some matter that should be attended to, then I would urge the brethren to pray about that matter, and to say to someone who can help, and has perhaps helped before, 'Come over to Durban and help us'.<a name=116:9></a> You will get an answer, although you may have to wait for it.<a name=116:10></a> Paul did.<a name=116:11></a> The man in Macedonia did not appear right away to him, but he did appear, and appeared in most remarkable circumstances too, when Paul and Silas were in the deepest sufferings, their feet fast in stocks, put on by the jailor, and they were suffering, but they were praising God in their sufferings.<a name=116:12></a> You may be sure that God will have respect not only to our prayers, but to our praises, as He had respect to the praises of Paul and Silas.<a name=116:13></a> They were praising God in the

		I come now to Mark.<a name=118:7></a> As I said, I passed by Luke, but I was compelled to refer to him two or three times.<a name=118:8></a> I want to speak now of the Lord praying, not only praying in a certain place, but praying at a certain time.<a name=118:9></a> Mark says, "And in the morning, rising up a great while before day".<a name=118:10></a> The Lord at such a time, we are told, "went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed", <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#1:35">Mark  1:35</a>.<a name=118:11></a> You can picture the position, dear brethren, and, of course, the heart is always alert normally in thinking of the Lord Jesus in any circumstance in which He was pleased to be, but especially so when He is pleased to be in prayer.<a name=118:12></a> The servant in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#11">Luke  11</a>saw the Lord praying, I should judge.<a name=118:13></a> Luke says He was praying in a certain place.<a name=118:14></a> We are not told whether it was morning, evening or night, but that it was in a certain place.<a name=118:15></a> The idea of place has to be observed because it really enters into the local assembly, as stated in Paul's epistle to the Corinthians, "in every place", where believers "call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ"; that is where the local assembly is to be found, and calling on the Lord is characteristic of the local assembly.<a name=118:16></a> We have been praying together in the ship, as I have said, and reading the Scriptures, but we have not broken bread there, for I do not gather that a ship is exactly a place in the sense in which the Spirit of God speaks of those who "in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus

		Now I am thinking of 'where', there is the idea of 'where' here; there is a desert place, and rising in the morning, long before day, the Lord went out and went away into a desert place.<a name=119:5></a> The word 'desert' there would signify that the place was devoid of anything that would be attractive to man naturally, not that the Lord could not enjoy things, in nature, in the creation.<a name=119:6></a> He never made much of it, but at the same time He was not dead to the excellencies of creation.<a name=119:7></a> The Lord said, "Consider the lilies .<a name=119:8></a>.<a name=119:9></a>.<a name=119:10></a> how they grow".<a name=119:11></a> He knew more about the lilies than even Solomon did, for He created them, but He did not occupy Himself much with these things.<a name=119:12></a> Presently, as the Son of man He will put His right foot on the sea and His left foot on the land, and He will cry as a lion roars, meaning that He has power, has a right to exercise power in all the earth.<a name=119:13></a> "The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof".<a name=119:14></a> It is His, and He made it, but He is not occupied with it just now.<a name=119:15></a> He is occupied with the assembly, dear brethren, I might say exclusively.<a name=119:16></a>

		The Lord says of a certain difficulty, "This kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#17:21">Matthew  17:21</a>.<a name=120:11></a> A special kind of power comes through fasting as allied to prayer too; and I think this is something which we should have laid on our hearts, dear brethren, this matter of fasting.<a name=120:12></a> Perhaps we shall get more answers to our prayers, realise more power in them, if we <i>do</i>.<a name=120:13></a> Of the Lord here, it is said, "In the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place,

		Now, dear brethren, I want you all to take that into your hearts, that <i>it was so</i>.<a name=123:7></a> Gideon simply asked God to do this, and it was so.<a name=123:8></a> The matter happened, and why should it not happen in my case; in any specific cases?<a name=123:9></a> One could mention specific cases in one's history, but I do not want to do that, for there is not one here who could not also mention specific matters in his history when God has answered.<a name=123:10></a> It is a question of what may be needed, and whether we get to God, so that the thing may happen.<a name=123:11></a> I want you to weigh that over.<a name=123:12></a> Get to God, as Gideon did; whatever it be that you are urgently in need about.<a name=123:13></a> Gideon is an example for us; he is set down as a man of faith, as the writer of the Hebrews says.<a name=123:14></a> "Time would fail me to tell of Gedeon" (chapter 11: 32); he had others also in mind, who, as Gideon, acted by faith.<a name=123:15></a> He was one of the men of faith, who did things for God.<a name=123:16></a> God acted to confirm his faith, so that, as he asked God for something, it was so.<a name=123:17></a> What he asked for, that there should be dew on the fleece only, would mean that the blessing was limited to Israel; that fact was seen in the history; for years and years, the blessing of God was on Israel.<a name=123:18></a> God had been with Israel and the nations were left out.<a name=123:19></a>

		The subject in mind is divine teaching as applied to the walk of a believer.<a name=126:1></a> There are many things taught of God, for God Himself teaches.<a name=126:2></a> He teaches through His servants, and indeed, He teaches the saints, through one another, but it is formally stated that God teaches, and that He teaches all His people.<a name=126:3></a> The word in mind, as it is in John's gospel, chapter 6, is, "They shall be all taught of God"; the 'they' of course, would be believers.<a name=126:4></a> It may indeed come out later as to Israel and as to men generally in the millennium, because the millennial period is to be a time of great light and knowledge.<a name=126:5></a> Indeed it is said that as the waters cover the sea, so the earth will be covered with the knowledge of the Lord -- a very great promise, a very encouraging promise, and one to be kept in our minds, especially when there is so much ignorance abroad.<a name=126:6></a> In the prophets it is said, "My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge" (<a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#4:6">Hosea  4:6</a>), which is a very humbling thing to be said of God's people.<a name=126:7></a> There is no reason why there should be a lack, because the knowledge of God is available.<a name=126:8></a> It is available in various ways.<a name=126:9></a> If people are ignorant, it is largely because they will be ignorant, as Paul says of one, "If any be ignorant, let him be ignorant".<a name=126:10></a> You may say, that is a very hard thing to say, but then there are people who are wilfully ignorant, and will not be instructed.<a name=126:11></a> So he has to say to the Corinthians, although he tenderly thinks of them and serves them, he has to say of some that they were "ignorant of God" -- a serious thing to be said that people are ignorant of God.<a name=126:12></a> That is not because God is not known, for He is; the Lord Jesus has made Him known, and yet it had to be said of some in Corinth, that they were ignorant of God,

		Now I am speaking, as I said, about walking, about how we can walk, and how God said that He taught Ephraim to walk.<a name=129:12></a> It was not that Ephraim was lame or halted like Jacob.<a name=129:13></a> Jacob halted on his thigh.<a name=129:14></a> God made him to halt, but He did not take away his power to walk.<a name=129:15></a> Jacob was able to walk, and he had instinct and discernment as to how to guide cattle, to know that cattle should not be overdriven, and if the thought is applied to believers, if believers are viewed to be the cattle, they should not be overdriven.<a name=129:16></a> That is to say, older brethren should not be severe on younger ones, because that is

		Well, now to come back to my scripture as to how Ephraim was taught to walk.<a name=130:7></a> I believe the allusion is to the book of Numbers.<a name=130:8></a> The book of Numbers, the order of it is Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, the fourth book of Moses.<a name=130:9></a> I have no doubt it was in this order that the books of Moses were written according to divine direction.<a name=130:10></a> The book of the Revelation was written by divine direction too.<a name=130:11></a> You remember how the Lord Jesus taught John, the writer of the book of Revelation, how to write the book, and if we are to understand the book we must study the order in which the book is written.<a name=130:12></a> The book was written by John, the writer of the gospel, and the Lord taught him how to write the book of Revelation.<a name=130:13></a> He signified to His servant, to His bondman John, not simply an apostle, but a bondman.<a name=130:14></a> You will all understand what that means, and it applies to every true christian.<a name=130:15></a> He is to be a bondman of Jesus, and His bondmanship is easy, it is not severe; His burden is easy and light.<a name=130:16></a> "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest .<a name=130:17></a>.<a name=130:18></a>.<a name=130:19></a> for my yoke is easy, and my burden is light", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11:28">Matthew  11:28</a> - 30.<a name=130:20></a> It is most attractive, and I would like everyone to come under that burden;

		In the first chapter, as I said, the Lord did teach John how to write the book of Revelation, and the first thing is "what thou hast seen" and then "the things that are".<a name=132:5></a> We have to learn what these mean, and then, "the things that are about to be after these".<a name=132:6></a> There are three phases; "what thou hast seen", "the things that are", and "the things that are about to be after these".<a name=132:7></a> They are a fine matter of study for every young man and woman here, and for the old brethren too.<a name=132:8></a> The old ones, I believe, really are acquainted with the book of Revelation generally.<a name=132:9></a> The teaching needed to write the books of Scripture began as Jehovah taught Moses how to write the Pentateuch, and He taught David how to write psalms.<a name=132:10></a> I do not say he wrote them all, but he collected many, I would say, and made them publishable, made them usable for believers at all times, that they might be comforted by the book of Psalms.<a name=132:11></a> David had that task, but Moses had the task of writing the Pentateuch, and we are now dealing with the fourth book, and it refers to the walk of God's people.<a name=132:12></a> God taught His people how to walk in the wilderness.<a name=132:13></a> It was no easy matter to go through the wilderness, because there were no roads, and there were no motor cars I need not say; there were no signposts on the way.<a name=132:14></a> It was just what it is called, a wilderness, and I believe the original title of the book I am speaking of was just this, 'In the wilderness'.<a name=132:15></a> Israel was in the wilderness, and God taught them in the wilderness how to walk, and hence they found their way into Canaan.<a name=132:16></a> Israel found their way out of Egypt through the Red Sea and over the Jordan into Canaan.<a name=132:17></a> This is what happened, and

	<div class="paragraph">
		In order to clarify what I have been saying, I refer to the first chapter of the book of Numbers.<a name=133:3></a> Israel are numbered; all the males from twenty years old and upwards, not all the women and children but all the males from twenty years old and upwards, are first and were to be taken account of according to their pedigree, another important word.<a name=133:4></a> That ought to have a searching effect on every one of us as to what it means spiritually, what a spiritual pedigree means.<a name=133:5></a> One has to show it if one is to be recognised by heaven, that I have a pedigree that is according to God.<a name=133:6></a> The numbering began in the second year after they had left Egypt, in the second month of it, in the first day of the month, and the numbering was by Moses and Aaron, but they were to have with them head men of every tribe in Israel.<a name=133:7></a> It was to be accurate, it was to be taken in the sight of heaven, as one might say, in the presence of the universe.<a name=133:8></a> These people whom God had brought out of Egypt are to be taught how to walk, but first they must be numbered, and numbered accurately by Moses and Aaron, and by one man out of each tribe of the children of Israel.<a name=133:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The pedigrees given are of the most remarkable company of people that ever appeared on the earth, but there in the wilderness, without any houses around them.<a name=133:10></a> Israel had cattle, of course, but it was a wilderness, and the numbering began there by Moses and Aaron and by one man, a named man, out of every tribe, and the numbering began according to the order of the tribes.<a name=133:11></a> They were all mentioned, Reuben and right down the line.<a name=133:12></a> They were all numbered.<a name=133:13></a> That is the first thing they have to learn, and in connection with that they have to learn the idea of a pedigree.<a name=133:14></a> Well, you say, what does it mean for me?<a name=133:15></a> Well, that is what I want you to think

		The next thing is the learning how to walk.<a name=134:17></a> Many walk a good deal when holiday-making in the summer time, and summer time is coming on in this part of the world, and there will be a good deal of walking, going to the seaside, and such like, but what I am dealing with, beloved, is how to walk, not at the seaside, not for holidays.<a name=134:18></a> Pardon me, I am not going to put you under any bondage in that sense.<a name=134:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is all very well to get fresh air, but there is often too much time spent in such pursuits.<a name=135:1></a> We want to know how to walk even as God taught Ephraim how to walk.<a name=135:2></a> He took him by the arms; very beautiful expression indeed.<a name=135:3></a> I will read it again in <a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#11">Hosea  11</a>"I it was that taught Ephraim to walk -- He took them upon his arms".<a name=135:4></a> That is what Jehovah did.<a name=135:5></a> He took them upon His arms; what a beautiful thought, showing the interest that God had in His people, taking them upon His arms as a parent would a child, so as to teach them how to walk.<a name=135:6></a> Then it adds, "They knew not that I healed them".<a name=135:7></a> That is to say, they were defective in that sense, but then it goes on to say in the fourth verse, "I drew them with bands of a man, with cords of love".<a name=135:8></a> Think of that.<a name=135:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Following up the thought of pedigree, let us think of what is said here as to being taught how to walk, and the tenderness of Jehovah in taking you by your arms, and it is further said drawn by bands of a man.<a name=135:10></a> That is how He did it.<a name=135:11></a> You may be in the burning sun of the desert and the heat and other things like that.<a name=135:12></a> God took pains to take the Israelites by their arms and to draw them by the bands of a man.<a name=135:13></a> I have no doubt that the man was Moses and Aaron.<a name=135:14></a> Moses and Aaron would represent all these things, the tenderness with which they took care of the people of God in the wilderness, and the antitypical teaching, dear brethren, is for every one of us tonight, so that we may be taught how to walk.<a name=135:15></a> God Himself would teach you how to walk along with the brethren.<a name=135:16></a> First of all to take the ground of being a christian, and then as confessing the Lord, get the Spirit, and further as confessing the Lord, come into fellowship, that is to say, let yourself become attached, not unattached, to the Lord's people.<a name=135:17></a> Link up with them vitally, recognising the Holy Spirit, and walk with them.<a name=135:18></a> Walk with the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, the next thing that I would say as regards the teaching of how to walk in the wilderness is in the second chapter of Numbers.<a name=136:4></a> I will be brief, at least, as brief as possible, so as to get through, so that we will not be over the usual time.<a name=136:5></a> The second chapter of Numbers has in mind the military position.<a name=136:6></a> In fact in the first thought of pedigree the numbering of each family is also military.<a name=136:7></a> The military idea is in the age of twenty.<a name=136:8></a> It is just the beginning of the first age, not the dying age, but they are beginning to live, as I might say, by the Holy Spirit, because antitypically that is what twenty years of age would mean; that the believer has the Holy Spirit, and as having the Holy Spirit that he is part of the military.<a name=136:9></a> He has part in the defence of the truth, not only of the walk that is suitable to it, but the defence of the truth.<a name=136:10></a> He is not to get out of step in the ranks.<a name=136:11></a> He is to learn how to walk, and to keep rank, as it says in Scripture.<a name=136:12></a> There were one hundred and twenty thousand who came to David who knew how to keep rank, how to walk together and not have diverse principles or methods.<a name=136:13></a> As Paul says, "Thus I ordain in all the assemblies", that is to say, all the assemblies are to be governed by the same principles, and it is a question of walk, how we walk together.<a name=136:14></a> If one gets out of step with the brethren he is in danger; <i>God</i> would say to such, You are in danger if you get out of step with the brethren in the wilderness.<a name=136:15></a> You may be lost in the wilderness, you may fall in it, and there are many such.<a name=136:16></a> With many of them God was not well pleased; they were strewn in the desert, a terrible thing.<a name=136:17></a> The bodies of nearly six hundred thousand of them were strewn in the desert.<a name=136:18></a> How awful that is, but

		J.T.<a name=141:2></a> The suggestion of the epistles to the Thessalonians is made with a measure of consideration and thoughtfulness, and particularly because they speak so much of judgment.<a name=141:3></a> It is thought that perhaps brethren have not sufficiently weighed the situation that has arisen in the present conditions among the nations, and then the conditions among the saints too, that the idea of judgment has not been taken into account sufficiently, especially in the light of the book of Revelation which was written late, as it is said, "Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to shew to his bondmen what must shortly take place".<a name=141:4></a> That book contains most awful judgments, and they are not imaginary; they are real; and the Lord would, I believe, stress the thought of judgment.<a name=141:5></a> This epistle and the second epistle are especially intended to stress this thought of judgment, especially the persons at whom the judgments are directed, giving distinction as they do to the whole course of history, for the whole course of God's government issues now in the present situation among the nations.<a name=141:6></a> It need hardly be said that we are thinking of the assembly, and its part in all this, and how much we are to be instructed as to it, and ready for it.<a name=141:7></a> Then there is the remarkable address by the apostle to this assembly, which is called the assembly of Thessalonians, as if to remind us that localities and nations and what is found in them cannot be ignored in our public services.<a name=141:8></a> And so the Thessalonians have a great place, but they are peculiarly addressed; that is, not the assembly at

	<div class="paragraph">
		Thessalonica, but "the assembly of Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ".<a name=142:1></a> So that the Father has a great place in the epistle, and the epistle itself shows what a great place the assembly of Thessalonians had in the heart of God, reflected in the apostle in the most endearing terms.<a name=142:2></a> Hence the thought of nations and cities cannot be ignored in our consideration of holy Scripture, because God has written Scripture in relation to history, and geography too.<a name=142:3></a> So that we are not to be indifferent to what the characteristics of Thessalonica were, and then, of course, what are the characteristics of the place in which we are today, and how much these characteristics have to be considered if we are looking into Scripture.<a name=142:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Rem.<a name=142:5></a> What you are stressing, if I gather it rightly, is that the peculiar conditions of countries or certain cities are to be taken account of in the ministry.<a name=142:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=142:7></a> I think they are.<a name=142:8></a> And the best illustration of that would be: "Cretans are always liars", <a href="../bible/Titus.htm#1:12">Titus  1:12</a>.<a name=142:9></a> That was the characteristic that had to be contended with in the ministry.<a name=142:10></a> It is therefore a question of any nation represented here, or country, or the one in which we are gathered, what its characteristics are.<a name=142:11></a> So in chapter 4 of the book of Acts we have the thought of "this city", that is to say, Jerusalem, the one they were in, where the Lord Jesus had been crucified; so we have to take account of what the characteristics are in this sense, and be intelligent about them.<a name=142:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=144:11></a> It certainly has a place in the testimony of the gospel of the word of God; and that raises a matter that one has thought of considerably; namely, that there is very little open-air preaching now, hardly any, and yet it is a good opportunity for asserting judgment.<a name=144:12></a> Indeed it is more convenient and suitable to assert the judgment of God publicly than to do it in the meeting rooms.<a name=144:13></a>

		"wrath" here is used first as to the general feature of it, "Our deliverer from the coming wrath", but now it is applied to the Jews, God's ancient people; for it is said here, in verse 16, that "wrath has come upon them to the uttermost".<a name=177:1></a> How terrible it is, that in spite of all that had been shown to them, as we have been speaking of it in Deuteronomy, that God's wrath has been expressed towards them!<a name=177:2></a> We see it all around us in all that is happening in Palestine and in Europe generally, how the government of God has pursued them.<a name=177:3></a> There is that which can be called wrath in its treatment of them.<a name=177:4></a> And yet all Israel shall be saved, so that there is something to work out in our souls as to the word "wrath" in regard to the Jews.<a name=177:5></a> No other family on earth is treated this way.<a name=177:6></a> God pursues them in His wrath, and yet He pursues them also according to His counsels that all Israel will be saved.<a name=177:7></a> It is another feature for us to think of, but the general thought of judgment in this epistle is very striking.<a name=177:8></a> And the general thought is attached to the Lord's coming too, because the idea will synchronise in His coming, as we shall see in the second epistle, in verse 5 of chapter 1: "a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, to the end that ye should be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for the sake of which ye also suffer; if at least it is a righteous thing with God to render tribulation to those that trouble you, and to you that are troubled repose with us, at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven, with the angels of his power, in flaming fire taking vengeance on those who know not God, and those who do not obey the glad tidings of our Lord Jesus Christ; who shall pay the penalty of everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his might, when he shall have come to be glorified in his saints, and wondered at in all that have believed".<a name=177:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=193:7></a> That is one of the rich doxologies of Romans and very significantly comes in at the close of the eleventh chapter.<a name=193:8></a> The ninth, tenth and eleventh chapters are a great parenthesis in the teaching, to link up the first part of the book dealing with the ministry among the nations, with God's ways as to Israel, and the promises to the fathers, because they were beloved on account of the fathers.<a name=193:9></a> It is a question of God's love, and hence the enlargement of the prophetic truth as to Israel, and therefore, as we had it yesterday, "All Israel shall be saved".<a name=193:10></a> It is very significant that there is such a doxology as that, that such feelings come out of the heart of God as in that doxology, because it is a question of His love.<a name=193:11></a> We cannot say that the nations are loved at all, but it does say the world was loved, "God so loved the world", but that is the world as a system of order, which indicates what God has done in creation.<a name=193:12></a> So that it has not just the same personal value as the end of the parenthesis that I am alluding to, because it is a question of the fathers' sakes; He loved them for the fathers' sakes.<a name=193:13></a> "So that all Israel shall be saved"; and then we see the terribleness of the gentile position, because they will be cut off.<a name=193:14></a> There will be no remedy at all for the gentiles for there is nothing promised to them afterwards, whereas there <i>is</i> something promised to Israel.<a name=193:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=203:9></a> What we are now dealing with is a great matter, a dispensational matter, and the idea of dispensation in the main is applicable to Israel and christianity, and Israel had the oracles at the beginning -- "to them were entrusted the oracles of God", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3:2">Romans  3:2</a>, and God worked accordingly.<a name=203:10></a> Then Christ came in and He was Himself the truth.<a name=203:11></a> He said, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life", <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:6">John  14:6</a>.<a name=203:12></a> The Spirit of God is also said to be the truth, so that we are now in the second great dispensation and it is really the greatest of all, and the ministry has in mind the oracles of God, and so 1 Corinthians provides for the oracles of God; we have already referred to Romans, that the oracles of God were committed to the Jews, but then that has all come into christianity and hence the oracles of God are vested in the temple of God.<a name=203:13></a> It is not a temple built by hands, but a spiritual temple, "Do ye not know that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?<a name=203:14></a>".<a name=203:15></a> That is the principle of these extended meetings; that is to say, it is not a question of fellowship only, but it is the truth, the truth of God, and the assembly is the pillar and base of it, so that the assembly must be in mind in some sense for any three-day meetings that are arranged for us.<a name=203:16></a>

		J.T.<a name=217:2></a> Well, the Lord is aiming at that in the revival that we are in now.<a name=217:3></a> Undoubtedly He has in mind that it should go on to the end, hence the strong word to Philadelphia in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:11">Revelation  3:11</a>, "I come quickly".<a name=217:4></a> That letter to Philadelphia has evidently in mind to touch the <i>assembly</i>.<a name=217:5></a> The words 'thee', and 'thou', and so forth, are to touch the assembly, the remnant as we sometimes say, as if it were the whole assembly, because it is so really in the Lord's mind.<a name=217:6></a> The passage referred to is <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:9">Revelation  3:9</a> - 11: "Behold, I make them of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews, and are not, but lie; behold, I will cause that they shall come and shall do homage before thy feet, and shall know that <i>I</i> have loved thee.<a name=217:7></a> Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, <i>I</i> also will keep thee out of the hour of trial, which is about to come upon the whole habitable world, to try them that dwell upon the earth".<a name=217:8></a> Then, "I come quickly, hold fast what thou hast, that no one take thy crown".<a name=217:9></a> Then all that follows that down to verse 13 is to emphasise the great features that will follow our translation.<a name=217:10></a> That is, "He that overcomes, him will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more at all out"; these are very comforting words for those who have to go out much; "and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven, from my God, and my new name".<a name=217:11></a> So that what we have in verses 9 to 11 must precede what we have in <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#4">1 Thessalonians  4</a>, the coming of the Lord Himself, as Scripture says, "But we do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them that are fallen asleep, to the end that ye be not grieved even as also the rest who have no

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=225:3></a> I think it is probably more comprehensive there than what we have here.<a name=225:4></a> The word 'change' implies what will be necessary, for in Christ "there is no male and female", <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3:28">Galatians  3:28</a>.<a name=225:5></a> That must be taken account of, the sovereign action of God to exclude male and female in the resurrection, so "that world and the resurrection" is a great matter in the divine counsels and secrets, and we have to make allowance for the things we do not understand.<a name=225:6></a> So <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:50">1 Corinthians  15:50</a> says that "flesh and blood cannot inherit God's kingdom", and we have to understand that, how that will come about.<a name=225:7></a> Much must happen, so that it is no longer a question of flesh and blood in the kingdom of God; there is to be a change, and the change would exclude many things, and bring in just what God has in mind to stand forever.<a name=225:8></a>

		J.T.<a name=241:1></a> It is thought well to linger a little on the protracted period, the prophetic period, before touching the final thought, God in judgment, in chapter 2.<a name=241:2></a> The suddenness of the judgment is touched on in chapter 5 of the first epistle, where the word is, "But concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that ye should be written to, for ye know perfectly well yourselves, that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief by night".<a name=241:3></a> The disciples inquired of the Lord, according to <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>, as to whether the kingdom should be restored to Israel then, but the Lord said that it was not for them to know the times and seasons.<a name=241:4></a> Evidently Paul had instructed the Thessalonians as to the general position as to judgment, so that is it carried down here, and in chapter 1 of the second epistle, the suddenness of the judgment being touched on.<a name=241:5></a> The Lord told His own at the beginning, that it was not for them to know the times and seasons, but the Father had reserved them in His own power, and that thought is generally prevalent in Scripture, especially in Mark, where the Lord says that no one knows the times alluded to but the Father, not even the Son; it is a remarkable thing that the Lord should be content to accept this.<a name=241:6></a> The book of Revelation evidently was held in abeyance in the Father's thoughts until God gave it to Christ, so that He should show to His bondmen what must shortly take place; so that we may have some inkling as to coming events, even before the actual facts of judgment are begun in the ways of God.<a name=241:7></a> John is the one that seems to have most to say, especially as to the great white throne.<a name=241:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=313:1></a> What is in mind is that the Lord's supper is the outcome of the passover.<a name=313:2></a> In the Lord's supper the Lord is seen as the house-father; that is to say, the disciples are regarded as auxiliary in some respects; that is, as children in His household, not in the sense in which the children of God are spoken of, but rather that the Lord has this place in the economy, according to the prophet Isaiah, "I and the children that Jehovah hath given me" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#8:18">Isaiah  8:18</a>), alluding to Christ as the Messiah.<a name=313:3></a> The thought has come down to us, and the Lord, I believe, carried it through to His supper.<a name=313:4></a> It would allude to passages in the gospels in which the disciples are viewed as children of Christ, especially in John's gospel.<a name=313:5></a> Peter says, "I go a fishing", and they all say the same thing, that they will go with him.<a name=313:6></a> There were seven of them, and the Lord says, "Children, have ye any meat?<a name=313:7></a>".<a name=313:8></a> He regards them as His children, according to what is said again by the prophet, that He is "Father of Eternity" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#9:6">Isaiah  9:6</a>), or Father of the age.<a name=313:9></a> It is a great thought attributed to Christ, and it should have an appealing effect on the young people especially that the Lord so familiarly takes the place of father to us here.<a name=313:10></a> The apostles had recourse to the same thought, especially John and Paul.<a name=313:11></a> Paul addresses the Corinthians as his children.<a name=313:12></a> John several times addresses those to whom he writes as children.<a name=313:13></a> And so the Lord condescends to bring us into this place, the place of children; not in the sense in which God takes the place of Father, but in the sense in which the Messiah had that place, and the Lord takes it up in the gospels.<a name=313:14></a> I thought all this should be mentioned at the beginning, because the subject begins on the day of unleavened bread, in which the passover

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=332:1></a> This chapter sets before us the inauguration of the dispensation, and the character of it, the gospel being intended to be the outstanding feature of the dispensation, resulting in the formation of the assembly.<a name=332:2></a> What the apostle says from verse 32 to the end of verse 41 may be regarded as entering into the whole chapter, the result in detail being seen in the verses read; that is to say, what marked the early disciples, of whom there were more than three thousand according to what is stated.<a name=332:3></a> It appears as if God would signalise the inauguration of the dispensation by the immediate result of the gospel, the immediate result being that a great many relatively were affected.<a name=332:4></a> Then, in view of what is asserted in authority by Peter in the power of gift, the verses read, beginning with verse 42, tell us how the testimony affected those that believed, and how they persevered, as it is said, in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers.<a name=332:5></a> So that what is in mind now is to point out that the apostolic service is stressed; not Mosaic or Old Testament service in all its subdivisions, but what is stressed is apostolic testimony, not Moses' testimony.<a name=332:6></a> Those who believed persevered in the testimony and teaching and fellowship of the apostles.<a name=332:7></a>

		J.T.<a name=401:1></a> What is in mind is that the Lord Jesus has a household, which He regards as His own, and hence these scriptures speak of His children.<a name=401:2></a> They are to be viewed relatively, not in the sense of His being a father, as God is, but as given children Himself, and hence having a household.<a name=401:3></a> And so these scriptures in the New Testament show how He regarded the disciples, involving tender affections, parental affections, but tender and gracious.<a name=401:4></a> So that the thought will bring out the link between the Old Testament and the New in this sense, that Christ being the Messiah was regarded as having a house, and hence the passover became introductory to the Lord's supper, involving all the government of a house.<a name=401:5></a> This should have a special reference to young people, and to parental feeling in older ones so that the young are cared for in view of the Lord's supper and the service of God working out in it.<a name=401:6></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=402:13></a> Well, I was thinking of the first part so as to proceed in order, as to what was referred to in chapter 7; it says, "And Jehovah spoke again to Ahaz, saying, Ask for thee a sign from Jehovah thy God; ask for it in the deep, or in the height above.<a name=402:14></a> And Ahaz said, I will not ask, and will not tempt Jehovah.<a name=402:15></a> And he said, Hear then, house of David, Is it a small matter for you to weary men, that ye weary also my God?<a name=402:16></a> Therefore will the Lord himself give you a sign, Behold, the virgin shall conceive and shall bring forth a son, and call his name Immanuel" (which we all know means 'God with us').<a name=402:17></a> "Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and to choose the good.<a name=402:18></a> For before the child knoweth to refuse the evil and to choose the good, the land whose two kings thou fearest shall be forsaken.<a name=402:19></a> Jehovah will bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy father's house, days which have not come since the day when Ephraim turned away from Judah .<a name=402:20></a>.<a name=402:21></a>.<a name=402:22></a>" (verses  10 - 17).<a name=402:23></a> Now you referred to another scripture.<a name=402:24></a>

		J.T.<a name=402:28></a> So as to get the full bearing of the text, the chapter begins, "And Jehovah said to me, Take thee a great tablet, and write thereon with a man's style, concerning Maher-shalal-hash-baz.<a name=402:29></a> And I took unto me to witness, sure witnesses".<a name=402:30></a> And then it says in

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=403:14></a> That is just the point that I had in mind, because the passover was introduced in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#12">Exodus  12</a>, and it was to be the beginning of months, the first of the year for Israel.<a name=403:15></a> So that it is a significant thing and opens up wide avenues of instruction, and particularly because it makes way for children; and then the Lord's own part in it in the sense of government, for He is the Son over the house of God.<a name=403:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=424:1></a> This section is very attractive, for there is something to be added, and it is the principle of excelling coming into christianity; and the apostle himself is an example to us of excelling.<a name=424:2></a> Even if it were to be applied in an ordinary sense, in ordinary affairs, the thought of excelling is a right thought to have in mind; whatever we are going to do, to do it well, to excel in it.<a name=424:3></a> If it is right at all, it is right to excel in it.<a name=424:4></a> But if you refer to the word of the apostle, then we are, of course, attracted to the excellence of the things, not simply what Paul excelled in, but the excellency of the things that are indicated in this chapter.<a name=424:5></a> I suppose Philippians is a sort of pointer to what is excellent, as it is said, "The things that are more excellent" (chapter 1: 10).<a name=424:6></a> But even as to ordinary things, here the apostle refers to what marked him as a Jew, in order to combat the Jewish opposers of the truth.<a name=424:7></a> "As to the law, a Pharisee; as to zeal, persecuting the assembly; as to righteousness which is in the law, found blameless".<a name=424:8></a> So that he himself excelled even in that, and this, no doubt helped him to combat Jewish efforts against the truth.<a name=424:9></a> They could not boast much in the presence of Paul, even as to the great distinction that judaism had acquired in the world.<a name=424:10></a>

		J.T.<a name=438:1></a> The proposal is to speak, as we are together, of the truth as apprehended in the feminine feature of it, and therefore we have read from <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#25">1 Samuel  25</a>, because it speaks of one of the leading types of the assembly; and, of course, if we are to apprehend the feminine side of the truth, we have to consider the types, beginning with Eve.<a name=438:2></a> But this chapter is chosen because it presents such an important type, and one that bears on assembly service, and particularly on procedure.<a name=438:3></a> The book of Samuel affords opportunity, as we have said, to speak of the truth from the feminine standpoint, and Abigail comes in as a leading type; but then she has to be regarded as associated with David, therefore our subject is Abigail and David combined.<a name=438:4></a> The next thing to consider is the fact that Samuel is said to have died.<a name=438:5></a> That is to say, there is a circumstance of serious occasion in Israel, and the question is as to how it is to be met.<a name=438:6></a> We have the fact of Samuel's death, and then immediately it is said in the first verse, that "David arose and went down to the wilderness of Paran"; and we are told about Nabal in order to bring out the facts relative to Abigail.<a name=438:7></a> Abigail is in mind to indicate to us how the assembly is to have its place with us in all crises or difficulties, the assembly is to have the first place in regard to procedure generally.<a name=438:8></a> So that we err greatly unless we take into account the saints as a whole in all matters, bringing in the assembly; she must be regarded in <i>all</i> matters.<a name=438:9></a> What is called a care meeting can hardly in itself be regarded as a means for dealing with matters finally; for finality, matters have to come to the assembly.<a name=438:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=447:14></a> 'Constitutional' is good.<a name=447:15></a> You mean it bears on what we are, because we have, ultimately anyway, to think of ourselves as a whole.<a name=447:16></a> I mean that the assembly has to learn to think of itself as a whole, because it is an immense thought.<a name=447:17></a> <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21">Revelation  21</a>shows how immense it is; it is a regular cube of persons.<a name=447:18></a> It is difficult to lay hold of it in a natural sense, but these are the facts.<a name=447:19></a>

		J.T.<a name=448:7></a> That is the point, I am sure, and we can hardly say it too often that the Spirit of God is here, and remains here.<a name=448:8></a> He remains here from the time He was sent down; "sent from heaven", as the scripture says.<a name=448:9></a> The Spirit of God remains here, and He will remain until we are taken up.<a name=448:10></a> He does not take us up.<a name=448:11></a> The Lord takes us up, but the Spirit remains with us until the time of our taking up or translation.<a name=448:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=448:16></a> Well, it is a question of being able to visualise what the Spirit of God means in these expressions.<a name=448:17></a> We suppose one hundred, two hundred or five hundred brothers sitting together, they have intelligence.<a name=448:18></a> As a thing arises, we have intelligence and speak of it in an intelligent way; so we have, as it were, to discern what the Spirit of God means when He says, "Tell it to the assembly".<a name=448:19></a> Well, facts would mean that we may tell it to each other as brethren; we may tell it to a few as brethren, but in due time we have to tell it to the whole company, the whole assembly has to be informed, and informed in an orderly way, in a holy way, too; not simply as men do in a parliamentary sense, for we are dealing with holy things.<a name=448:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.T.<a name=449:3></a> Quite so.<a name=449:4></a> Tentative is the best word that one can use, and a very important word.<a name=449:5></a> We await the <i>completion</i> of the matter, but much has to be done tentatively.<a name=449:6></a> We know each other, and speak freely to each other, have confidence in each other, and believe each other, and the Spirit of God joins His help to our weaknesses too, so that presently things happen according to God; so that what is done on earth is done in heaven; it is in agreement with heaven.<a name=449:7></a>

		The passage in 2 Timothy is particularly in mind for this meeting.<a name=457:1></a> Paul saying to Timothy, "Preach the word".<a name=457:2></a> On the boards, outside the doors of the meeting rooms, usually the gospel is announced, which is quite right, but "the word" at the present time is really more accurate than "the gospel"; for the importance of preaching the word, that is, the word of God, cannot be over-emphasised.<a name=457:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have selected Abraham for enlargement of this thought, because he is the one to whom <i>the word</i> is first said to have been spoken, that is the word of God.<a name=457:4></a> It is mentioned twice in the chapter, which I hope the brethren will take notice of, and see why it is so, why the matter appears just in this way so early in the history of Abraham, that the word of God should be spoken to him first; not that it was not spoken to others, but as to actual words used, it was spoken to him first.<a name=457:5></a> All that is in the chapter is to enlarge on the thought, and to show too how the thought is to be set out basically and enlarged on, and how it is prophetic in a great measure, and yet future; so that, as I said, I am free to take up Abraham as the subject, in the main.<a name=457:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I would point out, and will amplify later, that we belong to the <i>New</i> Testament.<a name=458:1></a> Genesis particularly enlarges on the generations of certain persons, certain distinguished persons, beginning with Adam, even enlarging on the creation itself; earth's resources of vegetation and the like, are all attributed to creation.<a name=458:2></a> We read of the histories, or generations, of the heavens and the earth, when they were created.<a name=458:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I mention that, because it may be overlooked by us, and it is the function of ministry to do all possible to instruct the saints, until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God; and we have not yet arrived at that in any great measure, brethren.<a name=458:4></a> Though I have not been here much, I can only speak from my general knowledge of the gatherings universally, in saying that in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ, as to the full-grown man, we have not advanced very much; whereas Ephesians has in mind that we should be no longer babes.<a name=458:5></a> Every one of us has been a babe, or if he has not, he will be a babe spiritually; but then Ephesians is aiming at much more than that, <i>the full grown man</i>, and that we should be no longer babes.<a name=458:6></a> It is not to discredit our having been babes, but to make it clear that we should be no longer babes.<a name=458:7></a> Many are content with the stage they have reached in the truth, but growth is the principal thought in mind, the growth of the saints, and so, as I said, Abraham, the most distinguished man in Genesis, is taken up in a most remarkable way.<a name=458:8></a> Mention is made of generations, such as of Adam, Noah, Isaac, and Jacob, but <i>not</i> of Abraham.<a name=458:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In saying that I would in no sense convey to anybody that Abraham is not the most distinguished man in Genesis, for I believe he is, and yet he is left out of the records of generations, he is not mentioned.<a name=458:10></a> I believe, dear brethren, that he is just in that sense exempted, as <i>we</i> all are.<a name=458:11></a> We are all exempted from

		Now, that is why, with other things, I have read <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#15">Genesis  15</a>, which I am calling Abraham's chapter, supremely.<a name=460:2></a> It is after certain other things had happened.<a name=460:3></a> It is after chapter 14; that is the chapter in which Melchizedek met him, and blessed him.<a name=460:4></a> Melchizedek blessed him, for he was greater than Abraham.<a name=460:5></a> It is quite right to make comparisons in these personalities.<a name=460:6></a> I do not mean the Deity, but persons who are distinguished by coming to the Lord Jesus; and Melchizedek was a type of the Lord Jesus; he was assimilated to Him, to the Son of God.<a name=460:7></a> It is said of him, "Without father, without mother, without genealogy; having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but assimilated to the Son of God, abides a priest continually".<a name=460:8></a> That is to present Christ to us, the real Melchizedek.<a name=460:9></a> He appears before this chapter, in which we are told that "the word of Jehovah came to Abram in a vision".<a name=460:10></a> I think that it is the first time we get a vision in Scripture; the word came to him in a vision after a certain period, and God said, "Fear not.<a name=460:11></a> Abram; I am thy shield, thy exceeding great reward".<a name=460:12></a> That is how Abraham is met, when the word is presented to him, and what I have in my mind is to encourage and interest everybody here, in the <i>word</i> of God, because of the light it always carries with it, the knowledge of God.<a name=460:13></a> It is a question of the <i>word</i> of God, and the word of God is really God Himself, no less than that.<a name=460:14></a> It is "living and operative, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and penetrating to the division of soul and spirit, both of joints and marrow, and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.<a name=460:15></a> And there is not a creature unapparent before him; but all things are naked and laid bare to his eyes, with whom we have to do".<a name=460:16></a> <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#4:12">Hebrews  4:12</a>, 13.<a name=460:17></a> You may see there how the idea of

		Having said all that, I proceed to show how Abraham was taken up at this point, because it is early in his history, it is before the birth of Isaac and before the birth of Ishmael.<a name=461:7></a> God is bent on instructing Abraham, and Abraham was bent on being instructed, for he says to God, "How shall I know?<a name=461:8></a>".<a name=461:9></a> Are there any young people here who want to know things?<a name=461:10></a> How are you going to know things?<a name=461:11></a> It would take a good while to enlarge on the amount of knowledge that we have, but the <i>means</i> of knowledge that we have is the Holy Spirit, and this is one of the greatest thoughts that the Scriptures afford us, that the Holy Spirit is here to instruct the saints, so that we be no longer babes, for the assembly is not made up of babes, it is made up of grown men, not women, but <i>men</i>.<a name=461:12></a> It is made up of men, or persons who are converted, and who have the Holy Spirit, and understand the truth.<a name=461:13></a> The assembly is viewed also as a feminine thought, dear brethren, and God has His own way of changing the feminine idea from man and woman.<a name=461:14></a> The Scripture says, "There is no Jew nor Greek; there is no bondman nor freeman; there is no male and female; for ye are all one in

		But then there are other things, and it is a question of the word, as I have been saying.<a name=464:14></a> Abraham was to take some things, not buy them; certain creatures were required for this matter of instruction that Abraham needed.<a name=464:15></a> So God says to him, "Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she-goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtle-dove, and a young pigeon".<a name=464:16></a> The ages of the birds are not given, but the others are given; so it is a question of the age of these creatures.<a name=464:17></a> First the heifer, and the thought I had in mind, is that of

		And so the thought here is to bring out the word of God, how it was presented to Abraham first, and undoubtedly marked his whole life, and reaches up to the present time.<a name=469:11></a> Abraham was the subject of the work of God, and subject to the light of God, and God was his God.<a name=469:12></a> He was the God of Isaac and Jacob, and so He is our God on the same principle as He was Abraham's.<a name=469:13></a> We believe God, and it is counted to us as righteousness, and so we are subjects of the work of God, and it is in mind to illuminate our souls, to bring us up in the truth, that we should be a witness to Christ at this closing moment, not days or years, but moments, because the end is so very near.<a name=469:14></a> God is preparing, and making every one of us ready for the very great event of which the apostle speaks, "For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout".<a name=469:15></a> That is a clear evidence of His power, and as I said, our chapter finishes, "in the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates".<a name=469:16></a> The whole matter is settled on the principle of covenant between God and Abraham.<a name=469:17></a>

		What is in mind, dear brethren, is to call attention to the fact that God at times reduces His people in order that they may be usable, that He may accomplish His purposes.<a name=470:1></a> This has been His way from the outset, and it is brought forward now because it has application tonight.<a name=470:2></a> God has things to do and He intends to do them by persons who are wholly dependent on Him, and dependent, it may be, on Him because of their fewness, because of their weakness, for it is said of certain ones in earlier days, "out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens".<a name=470:3></a> So in this case of Gideon in the book of Judges, we have a remarkable illustration of war carried on for the defence of the truth, the defence of God's people, and Jehovah decided that they were too many to accomplish the work, because He wished to make room for Himself.<a name=470:4></a> And so He said to Gideon, "The people that are with thee are too many".<a name=470:5></a> As a matter of fact, history shows that in result, as the battle developed and increased, and was won by Israel, there were a greater number with Israel than there were at this particular time; there were more than thirty-two thousand, but that was the number at this particular time, and Jehovah decided and said that there were too many.<a name=470:6></a> And He said to Gideon that those who were fearful should depart, and leave mount Gilead and return to their tents.<a name=470:7></a> So they did, and you can understand, dear brethren, that those who returned would not be making any show of triumph, they would be humbled, and God intended that; that they should return, not a victorious people in war, but a humbled people, because they were fearful in war.<a name=470:8></a>

		But then they were yet too many.<a name=471:1></a> God says to Gideon: "The people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee".<a name=471:2></a> That is to say, the number must be reduced, because the victory must be God's, the work must be God's, the result must be God's, and whatever is to be done must be done by God.<a name=471:3></a> He will have it so.<a name=471:4></a> And so, dear brethren, He is with His people to wage their battles, to win their battles for them, but He wishes to have a certain number, He wishes to have a usable number.<a name=471:5></a> This is something which I believe has application to the present time, and therefore I have read it, and am speaking of it, and I want to continue the subject further in the gospel of Matthew.<a name=471:6></a> Matthew being the assembly gospel, as we have often said to one another, there is the same principle of reduction, and then we have the same principle in the book of Revelation.<a name=471:7></a> The same principle is there, although the idea of the assembly is retained, and that is just exactly what I want to enforce in what I have to say, that whatever reduction there may be made, in order that God should have a usable people, a people for His own use, a people that should glorify Him in what He does, He retains the idea of the assembly.<a name=471:8></a> This is the time of the assembly, the assembly period, and God is not giving up His thought at all; it is continuing.<a name=471:9></a> And so whatever happens, whether we are reduced in number, or increased in number, God will have the assembly maintained, so that His thought as to the dispensation may be realised.<a name=471:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Matthew is the evangelist that is selected to bring out this truth, but I have turned to the book of Judges, to bring out the type of it, a type of the situation which I believe is current at the present time amongst the saints, both here and in other parts of the world.<a name=471:11></a> That is to say, God is prospering His people in a material way, prospering them too in

	<div class="paragraph">
		numbers or largeness of meetings, and prospering them in other respects, all of which, and indeed each of which, would tend to shut Him out, whereas His thought is to come in, and be in, and stay with us, hence in Matthew the Lord says, "Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world".<a name=472:1></a> So that we need not be without Him, and if He is not with us, we need not think that we can have recourse to some other means to accomplish our thoughts.<a name=472:2></a> God will retain His place with us, and He will reduce us to retain it, because He has designed to work Himself.<a name=472:3></a> He has come in, in Christ; He has the Man of His counsel, the Man according to His own heart, as David was, and He wishes to use Him, and He wishes to use those whom that Man would choose, and provide with gift to be used.<a name=472:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So in turning to Judges, it is just to bring out a type, and it is a striking type too; it is indeed brought into an anti-type in the second epistle to the Corinthians, an epistle that deals with church methods and manners and ways.<a name=472:5></a> And so I will just read a passage that intimates to us what is meant in this type in the book of Judges, and you will see when I read it, that it means reduction in a moral way if we are to be usable to God.<a name=472:6></a> The passage is <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:7">2 Corinthians  4:7</a> - 14, "But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the surpassingness of the power may be of God, and not from us, every way afflicted, but not straitened; seeing no apparent issue, but our way not entirely shut up; persecuted, but not abandoned; cast down, but not destroyed; always bearing about in the body the dying of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our body; for we who live are always delivered unto death on account of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh; so that death works in us, but life in you.<a name=472:7></a> And having the same spirit of faith, according to what is written, I have believed,

		So there were thirty-two thousand of the people, and God says they are too many.<a name=473:14></a> Now you may question in your minds what I am alluding to, and I do not wish to be literal in any allusion I am making; I wish to convey the truth, dear brethren, without any sense of accusing anybody, or questioning any thing or person in the service of God, in this country or any other country.<a name=473:15></a> I would only bring out certain truths, and we are entitled to do that; we should, if we are serving the Lord, bring out

		in early in chapter 6 he was threshing wheat, which was a difficult matter.<a name=475:1></a> It was in a certain place that was not very convenient for the purpose, but he was doing it, and he was doing it to hide the wheat from the Midianites.<a name=475:2></a> Without anybody but himself, he was doing that; he was threshing wheat.<a name=475:3></a> And Jehovah looked upon him, and He said to him, "Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel, .<a name=475:4></a>.<a name=475:5></a>.<a name=475:6></a> thou shalt smite Midian as one man".<a name=475:7></a> And so I would say, dear brethren, let us take up what any one of us can do.<a name=475:8></a> If we see that certain things are to be done, and they are not being done, well, the business of the person that sees that, is to do them, and do what he can.<a name=475:9></a> That is to say, with one man; do what <i>one man</i> can do.<a name=475:10></a> And that is the point with Gideon.<a name=475:11></a> Hence you can understand how Jehovah would reduce the number from thirty-two thousand.<a name=475:12></a> There would be a great many Gideons in that sense, and God would have the number reduced.<a name=475:13></a> He would have <i>one man</i>.<a name=475:14></a> That was the principle that He had then in mind, and at the present time, there are things that He has in mind, and maybe it is that He is not reaching His designs and end, because we have too many, and too much.<a name=475:15></a> I am not saying it is so, I am only suggesting, dear brethren, without questioning, or accusing, or hinting anything of that kind; but there is such a thing as one man doing everything at a particular time, and that is what God said to Gideon.<a name=475:16></a> And as to God, and Christ, and the Spirit, one Man is the principle; that is to say only one Person in the Deity became Man, became incarnate, and He has undertaken the whole matter, thank God.<a name=475:17></a> No one else could do it initially except Himself, and He did it.<a name=475:18></a> He said, according to John, "It is finished".<a name=475:19></a> He did it Himself.<a name=475:20></a> But then in due time, others are taken on, and so it is that a large number here today have been taken on, amongst them myself, in my little way, and I thank God for it,

		and thank God for others too, whom I know here, who are actively engaged in the Lord's service; they have been added to the real Gideon.<a name=476:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then Gideon had his questions.<a name=476:2></a> They were very reasonable too, but he came to perceive that the Speaker was God, was God's angel.<a name=476:3></a> It is a great matter to learn to perceive God.<a name=476:4></a> There are certain circumstances in which God can be seen, dear brethren.<a name=476:5></a> No man has seen Him nor can see Him, in one sense, but still, in another sense, God can be seen.<a name=476:6></a> Gideon perceived it was God, no less, and he said to the Angel that he would like to present something to Him, he would like to offer something; as was said of the Lord Jesus as Priest, He must have somewhat to offer.<a name=476:7></a> And so it is, dear brethren, if we are to serve God, there must be something to offer.<a name=476:8></a> What have we to offer?<a name=476:9></a> Gideon had something to offer, and the Angel said to him that He would wait for him.<a name=476:10></a> This is God, beloved.<a name=476:11></a> God will wait for us, but He wants to have His work done in His own way, in His own way without any additions, or any human methods.<a name=476:12></a> And so it is with Gideon; the Angel waited on him, a very beautiful thought, just as Jehovah waited on Abraham, and as He is ready to wait on anyone here who essays to serve Him.<a name=476:13></a> God will wait for you, He will give you time to get ready, because there is the idea of readiness in the service of God, and God will give us time to get ready.<a name=476:14></a> And so the Angel waited.<a name=476:15></a> I cannot say just where He sat, or what He was doing, but He waited.<a name=476:16></a> Just as Jehovah and two angels in earlier days had waited on Abraham, till he prepared for them.<a name=476:17></a> They waited under a tree for him.<a name=476:18></a> So here the Angel waited, and Gideon brought his present, which is a very beautiful thought; and the Angel directed him as to that, because we must come under divine direction, if we are to do anything for God.<a name=476:19></a> So the Angel used His staff, nothing more than that.<a name=476:20></a> Just
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=477>[Page 477]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		as in the case of Moses, the staff was the thing.<a name=477:1></a> God says, "What is that in thy hand?<a name=477:2></a>".<a name=477:3></a> He says, "A staff", and so he had a staff, and many things were done by it.<a name=477:4></a> So here the Angel used His staff, and caused the fire to ascend, and to gather up what Gideon had brought to Him and presented.<a name=477:5></a> It went up to heaven.<a name=477:6></a> There must be a going up to heaven, beloved.<a name=477:7></a> And so it is that Jesus went up to heaven, before He really began to operate as to gathering.<a name=477:8></a> He went up to heaven and then sent down the Spirit.<a name=477:9></a> The Spirit was sent <i>down</i> from heaven, and hence the great gathering that has come about.<a name=477:10></a> There is a great gathering here tonight too, thank God; it is the work of the Spirit.<a name=477:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So to enlarge further on what I am saying, as entering into the type, the Angel said to him that he should offer a bullock, the second bullock that his father had; and he did.<a name=477:12></a> But he was to offer it at a certain place, and it is to be according to the "ordered manner", and that brings out the whole question, dear brethren, of how things are done, whether it be here, or elsewhere.<a name=477:13></a> <i>How</i> things are done -- whatever they be, whether it be preaching the word, or ministering in any way, or discipline, it is a question of how things are done, because God is jealous as to His own methods, and He will have them abided by.<a name=477:14></a> And so it was in the ordered place, so that Gideon is now on the way to be used, and he was used in a most remarkable way.<a name=477:15></a> He was used according to what I read in Paul's account, but used here in the sense that the ten thousand that were left, were brought down to the water, and God says, "I will try them for thee"; and the way was, that they must lap the water as a dog lapped it.<a name=477:16></a> That is a very humbling thing, that we have to do things as dogs do them, and yet it cannot be done otherwise, to be done rightly, at this point.<a name=477:17></a> And only three hundred succeeded, only three hundred
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=478>[Page 478]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		were admitted as succeeding in this simple method of lapping water with their hand to their mouth.<a name=478:1></a> I do not need to enlarge on that in detail, as no doubt every child here will know something about this remarkable story of Gideon, but the three hundred were there, and were victorious, and all the others had to go home.<a name=478:2></a> It is a very humbling thing to have to go home; first, because you are afraid of the battle, and secondly, because you do not know how to do what is required.<a name=478:3></a> It would be very much better at times if we did go home if things are not done properly, because God will have them done rightly.<a name=478:4></a> He has His own meaning in them, and He will have them done rightly, if they are to be done at all.<a name=478:5></a> And so these nine thousand seven hundred had to go home.<a name=478:6></a> They were disqualified because they were unable to lap the water as dogs do.<a name=478:7></a> There were only three hundred that could do it, and they did it, and God says to Gideon, 'I will save you with those; that is, those that do what I wish to be done, and know how to do it, I will save you by them'.<a name=478:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, that is the simple outline of the facts here, only the further thought is the idea of the three hundred divided into three companies of one hundred, and they were to do everything that <i>Gideon</i> did; not as Jehovah said, but as Gideon did.<a name=478:9></a> He says, "Look on me".<a name=478:10></a> And that is the point, dear brethren, in these matters of assembly character; look to the Lord, see how He did them.<a name=478:11></a> And so it is, as we often quote, that a certain one says to the Lord, "Lord, teach us to pray".<a name=478:12></a> It is a very good thing that that brother, whoever he was, we are not told his name, did not say, 'Teach <i>me</i> to pray'.<a name=478:13></a> He wished all the others to be taught as well as himself.<a name=478:14></a> That is a liberal mind, that you do not want to keep things to yourself, or think you have something for ministry that nobody else has, that you have it secretly.<a name=478:15></a> This brother said to the Lord, "Teach <i>us</i>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=479>[Page 479]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		to pray", and I suppose that is the great lesson, that we learn to pray; and it is the greatest matter at the present time, that we should pray.<a name=479:1></a> We noticed already today, in referring to Philippi, how Paul and Silas, in prayer, praised God.<a name=479:2></a> That is the idea of the service of God proceeding from glory to glory, even in prison, because it is done according to God.<a name=479:3></a> How precious it must have been in the eyes of God in that prison, that there were two men there, their feet fast in the stocks, who were praying, and who then praised God.<a name=479:4></a> That was something that was pleasing to God, and that is the point in all that I am saying, what is pleasing to God.<a name=479:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To return to the subject, the three hundred men were divided into three companies, and they were to go all round the camp.<a name=479:6></a> That is to say, the attack was to be <i>all round</i>.<a name=479:7></a> That is the idea of the ministry, that it is universal, whatever it is.<a name=479:8></a> Whatever we have had today, or whatever we are having now, must be universal.<a name=479:9></a> It must be fit to travel, to go abroad, and become a part of the instruction of the saints.<a name=479:10></a> And so the company of Midianites, however large it was, was encompassed, but encompassed by three hundred men only, and yet they were as grasshoppers on the earth for numbers.<a name=479:11></a> But in result, as I said, as the battle proceeded, there were others beside those three hundred; indeed very many more than the thirty-two thousand, because God has numbers too, and He can use them.<a name=479:12></a> Indeed we have in the book of Revelation the idea of God using numbers, a number of persons that was uncountable; the book of Revelation speaks of that, showing that God has numbers, and will have numbers, and especially quality in them.<a name=479:13></a> And that is what I have in my mind in a moment to bring forward, dear brethren, quality; that in all that I am saying, the assembly must be in view, and the quality suitable to it must be in view.<a name=479:14></a> And so it was that Gideon's three
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=480>[Page 480]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		hundred were men of quality, and the ways and means were a pitcher, an earthen pitcher, as Paul says, "We have this treasure in earthen vessels".<a name=480:1></a> That is to say, it is a question of what we are by the creative power of God, that we are to be used in that humble way, whatever the work is that is to be done.<a name=480:2></a> And so it is a question of pitchers and light in the pitchers, and then the voice of Gideon, who said to them, "Look on me .<a name=480:3></a>.<a name=480:4></a>.<a name=480:5></a> as I do, so shall ye do".<a name=480:6></a> And that is the order of the moment, dear brethren, to have things done as the Lord has done them; the Spirit would teach us to do them, and the teaching of the Spirit is universal.<a name=480:7></a> The Lord Jesus says Himself of Him, that "<i>he</i> shall teach you all things", "he shall receive of mine and shall announce it to you", "he shall guide you into all the truth".<a name=480:8></a> Everything comes out subjectively by the Spirit here below; everything comes down from heaven, but works out down here by the Spirit, and in this and that one of us, whom God has fitted to carry on the work, but the eye must be on Christ Himself, as Gideon said to the three hundred men.<a name=480:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now I must pass on to Matthew.<a name=480:10></a> I have already remarked that Matthew is the assembly gospel, and there are good reasons for saying so.<a name=480:11></a> He carries out the Lord's instructions.<a name=480:12></a> These instructions were given in Galilee, not at Jerusalem.<a name=480:13></a> They were given in Galilee and the converts were to be baptised to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.<a name=480:14></a> Then the Lord says, "Lo, I am with you alway", so that we can carry out something of Gideon's example, in having the Lord with us.<a name=480:15></a> He is never said to have gone up to heaven in Matthew.<a name=480:16></a> Now that may seem strange to some of you, but it is a point to be understood, that in that sense He remains down here.<a name=480:17></a> The Spirit remains too, but the Spirit is in heaven too, as well as remaining down here; that is to be understood.<a name=480:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	<div class="paragraph">
		These things are to be understood, as was said to a certain man, "Understandest thou what thou readest?<a name=481:1></a>".<a name=481:2></a> The question is understanding, not simply the letter of Scripture, but the spirit of Scripture -- the letter, of course, because the letter would not be written if it was not needed, but the spirit of Scripture is greatly needed.<a name=481:3></a> And so the word in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28">Matthew  28</a>is, "Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world".<a name=481:4></a> A very precious and comforting thing, that the Lord is with us!<a name=481:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This comes out in the passage I read from chapter 18, in view of conditions that would reduce the brethren.<a name=481:6></a> That is to say a brother trespassing against another must lead to something being done about it by him; and if he refuses to do what he is told by the assembly then something must be done to meet that; that may mean reduction, and it does mean reduction.<a name=481:7></a> And so the Lord says the man who is trespassed against is to take the matter up with him alone, and ask him to judge himself; if he refuses, the Lord says, "Take with thee one or two besides".<a name=481:8></a> This divine principle is running down from the Old Testament, the book of Deuteronomy; two or three witnesses are needed to establish matters.<a name=481:9></a> When we come to dealing with moral things amongst the brethren we need two or three witnesses.<a name=481:10></a> It is a question of witnesses, witnesses as to facts.<a name=481:11></a> And so there is the thought of two or three witnesses.<a name=481:12></a> And the Lord says, "But if he will not listen to them, tell it to the assembly; and if also he will not listen to the assembly, let him be to thee as one of the nations and a tax-gatherer".<a name=481:13></a> So that is what happens, that the man is ostracised; ostracised at any rate by the man against whom he has trespassed.<a name=481:14></a> But then if the brethren are walking in fellowship really, and there are two or three there, or more, however many more walking in fellowship, they must abide by the principles which the Lord has so plainly
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=482>[Page 482]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		set down; and that is that a man must listen to the assembly or he must be ostracised.<a name=482:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a solemn matter, and it implies what I said, it implies some reduction; a very humbling reduction for him, for the man, but also for the brethren too, because we cannot afford to lose our brethren.<a name=482:2></a> If we love the brethren, we cannot afford to lose them, as reduced, as ostracised.<a name=482:3></a> We love our brethren, it is therefore a pain to us if we have to walk without them, but walk without them we must, unless they abide by the principles so plainly set down by the Lord.<a name=482:4></a> In the early days of the revival in which we have part, there was refusal to abide by these principles of two or three witnesses, and the fellowship; and hence a great many saints left us; they turned away, and, of course, there was a great reduction.<a name=482:5></a> God had His own meaning in that too.<a name=482:6></a> Out of that reduction came more light as to the assembly, and that is just what I mean, that in all that I have to say, the assembly must be in view.<a name=482:7></a> On the one hand, God must have rights.<a name=482:8></a> He must have liberty to do what He pleases, and on the other hand, He cannot be forced to walk with persons who will not abide by His principles, nor will the saints be forced to do so either.<a name=482:9></a> So that we are in that position, that the assembly is maintained, however few, and at the same time refined.<a name=482:10></a> The condition of the material out of which the assembly is formed is refined by the process.<a name=482:11></a> God has that way of doing things, and we can thank Him for it, because we are all profiting by it tonight, what God has done on this principle of reduction, even although it meant the loss of saints.<a name=482:12></a> But it has meant also the refinement of the material of the assembly, although the number has decreased.<a name=482:13></a> I mean to say the quality is increased, and the number has become decreased.<a name=482:14></a> So that we have to go on on those lines.<a name=482:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=483>[Page 483]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Matthew shows that the decrease arises out of a man trespassing, a trespasser who took no account of his trespassing; he had not submitted to the pleadings of his brother, and then secondly, to the pleadings of two or three of his brethren.<a name=483:1></a> On this account there is no other course, dear brethren, there must be reduction, because the persons involved are not fit for the fellowship.<a name=483:2></a> The reduction happens, but at the same time the refinement happens, and the assembly is formed more and more according to God's mind; that is the great point.<a name=483:3></a> And so in Matthew, the Lord says, "I am with you alway", and there are those that can go on, and they do go on.<a name=483:4></a> First, the Lord says after this occurrence, "Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven".<a name=483:5></a> Well, that is something.<a name=483:6></a> That is a great matter, dear brethren, that heaven is with us in what we are doing in the way of binding, but we must be sure that it is just done as it should be, according to the passage I read, according to the Lord's own words.<a name=483:7></a> It must be done as it should be.<a name=483:8></a> And then the next is, "Again I say unto you", the Lord says, "That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven".<a name=483:9></a> "It shall be done for them".<a name=483:10></a> Notice that.<a name=483:11></a> The persons who have been asking, who have agreed, who are of one mind; for God attaches great importance to unity.<a name=483:12></a> This comes out especially in the book of Philippians, which is so full of human feelings and sympathies.<a name=483:13></a> The apostle says that they were with him from the very outset.<a name=483:14></a> They ministered to him, and were with him, they had fellowship with him in the gospel up to the very moment in which he was writing, from the very beginning, and in that book we have it greatly stressed that we are to be of one mind.<a name=483:15></a> Not only that we are to be of one mind about things, certain things, but to <i>think</i> the same things,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=484>[Page 484]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		as well as to say them And so the Lord says further, as I said before, "Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven".<a name=484:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, you see what results we have, that we are never forced to be by ourselves, no one is ever forced to be alone.<a name=484:2></a> John indeed, John the evangelist, the prophet I should say, in the book of Revelation, was alone, but he was in prison, he was in the island called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus.<a name=484:3></a> He would be with the brethren otherwise, he would be ministering among them.<a name=484:4></a> So that there is such a thing as being alone, but there is no need for any of us to be alone, except one who is imprisoned, or one who is unable to be with the brethren for other good causes.<a name=484:5></a> If one is not able to be with the brethren, then he can be alone of course, but he should be with them whenever he can be.<a name=484:6></a> The eyes of heaven are on the brethren, and, dear brethren, we cannot go alone without our brethren.<a name=484:7></a> And so Matthew goes on to say, "Where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them".<a name=484:8></a> The same thing is there, the persons are in mind.<a name=484:9></a> They are in mind in what is being done for them.<a name=484:10></a> So that we need not be afraid of being alone, heaven taking notice of us, and here in this city now we have many; and it is a glorious thing to look on the faces that I am looking at now, and to speak to such persons.<a name=484:11></a> It is a glorious thing, and one values it.<a name=484:12></a> And so one is encouraged at the work of God, I might say, universally, as far as I am acquainted with it.<a name=484:13></a> It is taking on the character that is in evidence here tonight, although perhaps in a lesser degree of numbers.<a name=484:14></a> And then, as I said, Matthew establishes us as to this matter of reduction, in the fact that we can have either two or three, and when it comes to the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=485>[Page 485]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		two or three, they are gathered together.<a name=485:1></a> There is an assembly feature in the gathering together, and thus situated we may count on increase, and we always find it, and it is the increase of God, dear brethren.<a name=485:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Finally, in the passage in Revelation, I had the same thought in mind; that is to show how it works out in refinement, in quality, and on the other hand, it works out in the recognition of the assembly.<a name=485:3></a> The Lord says, "thee" and "thou".<a name=485:4></a> The word is to the angel of the assembly, but the angel as a representative of the assembly, and the angel is recognised in the pronouns "thee" and "thou", and such words as these; meaning that the Lord is taking account of us as the assembly.<a name=485:5></a> Wonderful word to be able to communicate, as I am communicating it now, and it is particularly so when He says, that they may know "that <i>I</i> have loved thee".<a name=485:6></a> That is not an individual, that is the assembly.<a name=485:7></a> What He has in His mind is the assembly, and He is causing it to be <i>known</i> that it is the assembly, and that He loved it, according to Ephesians.<a name=485:8></a> He "loved the assembly, and has delivered himself up for it".<a name=485:9></a> So you can see how these few passages work out what I have endeavoured to present to you; that is, the idea of refinement; on the one hand refinement in the work of God, affording liberty to God in the service in what He wants to do; and on the other hand affording refinement in the assembly itself, and the assembly itself being in evidence, both in Matthew, and in the book of Revelation.<a name=485:10></a>

		I refer to John's writings, feeling that they will commend themselves to us at this time, especially as conveying grace, as it is said, "The law was given by Moses, grace and truth subsists through Jesus Christ", so that the principle of grace, and that in a lavish way, is in mind in John's writings.<a name=486:1></a> But what I would immediately speak of is two words in this passage, the words, "He" and "we" -- "As he is, so are we in this world".<a name=486:2></a> That is to say, the Lord links Himself up with us, in this sense, saying that as He is, so are we.<a name=486:3></a> So that our theme will, in this way, take on these words, "He" and "we".<a name=486:4></a> "As he is, so are we", but in this <i>world</i>.<a name=486:5></a> We are in this world; we are not viewed as in heaven, but He is.<a name=486:6></a> We are viewed on earth, and in spite of this, the word says, "As he is, so are we in this world".<a name=486:7></a> So it is "He" and "we".<a name=486:8></a> And these thoughts will enable me to enlarge somewhat on the other passages read, and particularly as to this matter of judgment.<a name=486:9></a> We have had it before us today, and yesterday, and it is the most solemn subject we can have; but this passage says, "That we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world".<a name=486:10></a> Thus we stand related to Him, and in this sense He is identified with us, and hence we have boldness in the day of judgment, whenever it comes.<a name=486:11></a> The judgment will come, of course, there is nothing more sure, for God has appointed a day in the which He will judge the world; that does not mean judgment in a punitive sense, but in the sense of rule and order, but He has also in mind to place Christ on the great white throne, a most terrible thought.<a name=486:12></a> But we can nestle under the Lord's wings in the light of this verse that I have read, "As he is,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I proceed to enlarge a little, especially as to John, the apostle John, not John the baptist, but the apostle John, the same as in the book of the Revelation, who may be called the prophet John; one greatly trusted by the Lord, one confided in too, and not the least that He has confided in him to write the most precious things for us, especially the truths that are so impregnated with grace.<a name=487:2></a> And I am reminded of another scripture, similar to what I have read, but alas, in a negative sense, "He", that is the Lord Jesus, "came unto his own, and his own received him not".<a name=487:3></a> Well, you can contrast that, dear brethren, with other scriptures that I shall hope to speak of, that He was not received when He came into this world, for John presents Him as coming into this world; not as born in it, as Luke and Matthew speak of Him, but as having come, "the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us".<a name=487:4></a> So that we as christians understand that the Lord Jesus is God, and that He became something that He had not been before, but He became it in order to be with us; in order to work out, too, all that was needed for redemption, and for the accomplishment of God's purposes.<a name=487:5></a> So it is said, "The Word became flesh, and dwelt among us".<a name=487:6></a> And then the next thing is, "and we".<a name=487:7></a> There we get the 'we', that is to say, the christian's 'we'.<a name=487:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I hope everyone in this audience is a christian.<a name=487:9></a> We would feel for you if you are not, although it is quite possible there are those who are not christians, but there is no need of your continuing thus, for this very meeting is intended to affect you, to affect you in the sense of grace, so that you may become one of the 'we', the 'we' that are linked up with Christ, no less than that, and linked up with Him <i>as He is</i>.<a name=487:10></a> It shows how wonderful His redemptive work

		But then the Lord is the Leader in all this, and that is what I want to show according to <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>.<a name=488:12></a> It is said there that the Lord Jesus, knowing He was going to the Father, "having loved his own who were in the world, loved them to the end".<a name=488:13></a> Well, you say, that would show that He is a Person to be attracted by, as one that will love people continually; but then it is not only that He loves them continually for a period, but He loves them in spite of all possible opposition, and loves them to the end of the period of opposition; whatever it was and however long,

		That is another thing, eternal life.<a name=489:14></a> That is something that is shared in by us, but not His Deity, His Godhead.<a name=489:15></a> Eternal life is communicable, and we can have it, and every believer has it.<a name=489:16></a> Every true believer has it, because it says again in the most wonderful language by John: "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life".<a name=489:17></a> These are the conditions of redemption, the conditions of the gospel, but I am not attempting to preach the gospel now, but I do seek to unfold something of the meaning of terms, so that we might be in what they mean and possess the things, and be in the good of them, in the enjoyment

		It says, "being let go".<a name=497:2></a> We may not suffer persecution much now, in fact we do not.<a name=497:3></a> Christians are not in any special way suffering persecution as of old, but persecution may come to us; and it is well to think of it, too, because we do not know what is ahead of us.<a name=497:4></a> Yet, we do know what is ahead of us, and that is that the Lord Jesus has promised to keep us out of the hour of trial, which is about to come upon the whole habitable world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.<a name=497:5></a> The Lord Jesus has promised that to us, and it is a great thing to lay hold of the promise.<a name=497:6></a> Well, as I was saying, Peter and John were let go; that is to say, they had been under custody.<a name=497:7></a> The officers came to them and arrested them, but they were let go.<a name=497:8></a> Perhaps we may expect, that under the government of God, if we are persecuted, we may be let go; many have been.<a name=497:9></a> During recent years, many young men have been inducted into the army, and were bound to serve; there was no option attached to it, and they suffered, but God has blessed them.<a name=497:10></a> There are many who are in the service of the Lord now, because they submitted to the government of God in what they were inducted into.<a name=497:11></a>

		So we never can tell what may come, and it is well to have our minds made up as to consequences, and to make up our minds, too, that the Lord Jesus is involved.<a name=497:12></a> As Peter said he would lay down his life for Him, we may say the same; Peter said it, but the Lord questioned it, at least He pointed out that he would do something else; but then later he did actually do what he said he would do; he was actually martyred for Christ; and we may be martyred.<a name=497:13></a> I am not here to prophesy anything like suffering, because it is not my business, it is not my thought; but at the same time I do think it is well, dear brethren, for us to make up our minds as

		They were let go.<a name=498:4></a> That is what we read in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#4">Acts  4</a>; they were let go, and they went to their own.<a name=498:5></a> That is the way the passage should read.<a name=498:6></a> In the Authorised Version they went to their own company, and, of course, that was true, they were their own company, they were the apostles and the others that loved Jesus.<a name=498:7></a> They went to their own; it is the same word that is used in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>, and in <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>, and it is to show that the disciples came into the thought of 'He and we'.<a name=498:8></a> He had suffered, and now they are suffering.<a name=498:9></a> They had been imprisoned, but had been let go, and we may count on God, dear brethren, if sufferings come, if persecutions come, that we will be let go and that God will have mercy on us; that is the thing to have in our minds, to learn to pray, and to count on God to answer our prayers that there will be the letting go.<a name=498:10></a> There has been this, in fact, during the past years to which I have alluded, but there may be more suffering.<a name=498:11></a> I am just urging now that the dear brethren will be simple about it, and yet face everything, face the conditions, not be blind to the conditions that are in the world; the Lord will love us right through them.<a name=498:12></a> At the same time the consequences may be more severe than we expect, and the Lord would have us to be ready.<a name=498:13></a> Peter and John were ready, and they rejoiced that they were suffering for Him; that was the state of things at the beginning, and one would love to see that state of things being revived, the idea of suffering for Christ.<a name=498:14></a> It is given to us, it says, to suffer, not only to believe on the Lord Jesus, but to suffer for His sake.<a name=498:15></a> And again, as the Lord said of Paul, "I will show him how great things he must suffer

		But then there are these great things that, "as he is, so are we in this world", and that He is loving us to the end, and that love will continue, too, eternally.<a name=499:4></a> And then, that there is love among ourselves; and one of the greatest things in a moral sense, is that in spite of the conditions in the world, there are those who actually love each other.<a name=499:5></a> I believe I may say freely that all in this whole company in this hall, large hall as it is, in general all love one another.<a name=499:6></a> I would ask anyone here who is not one of us, but a real christian, just to take note of this, that there are so many in this hall in Sydney who love one another.<a name=499:7></a> It is one of the greatest things that can be said, really, in a moral sense, that there are so many who love one another.<a name=499:8></a> It is so, whatever you may think, that there are those who love one another, and as many as you see here tonight, and I thank God for them.<a name=499:9></a> The fact is, it draws out one's heart to all the brethren, because their very love in itself makes them lovable.<a name=499:10></a> It makes them lovable to Christ, and lovable to every admirer of love, of persons who have love, and who love one another.<a name=499:11></a> So I would urge, dear brethren, in view of all that I have read and said at this time, that we should keep in mind the possibilities.<a name=499:12></a> The Lord would have us to be ready for any and every eventuality that the testimony may require or may bring upon us, so that we may glorify the Lord as His martyrs, because that is what is given to us, to be His martyrs, as Paul said of Stephen, "thy martyr, Stephen".<a name=499:13></a> One loves the thought.<a name=499:14></a>

		I have in mind to be brief at this meeting at the end of our series.<a name=501:1></a> At the same time I wish to consider the circumstances in which we are found, and to say something that will help in them, help the saints locally and all of us.<a name=501:2></a> This book from which I have read is well known to be peculiar, and it is regarded by some as a sealed book; the latter thought is wholly false, for it is not sealed, it is open.<a name=501:3></a> We have in it what is called a little opened book, meaning that what is in mind is not very cumbersome, not such as the world would regard as great, but which nevertheless comprises immense moral history.<a name=501:4></a> And this is in mind in what has been read, that the brethren may be on moral lines.<a name=501:5></a> So that, as we read, we may know how to discern, to judge.<a name=501:6></a> The apostle Paul says, "Do ye judge".<a name=501:7></a> That is, we are to judge of what is said and the import of it, and gain in strength in a moral sense, for we are surrounded with immoral conditions; immoral in the sense of infringement of divine rights, and we need certain features, especially wisdom, in dealing with them.<a name=501:8></a> At the same time moral power also, so that we are not fearful, we are not afraid when we are in the right, and we have to speak for what is right.<a name=501:9></a> And so the Lord says, "Fear not them which kill the body, .<a name=501:10></a>.<a name=501:11></a>.<a name=501:12></a> but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#10:28">Matthew  10:28</a>.<a name=501:13></a> And then we have Jehovah's dealings with Abraham, who is called, the Scripture says, alone; "I called him alone, and blessed him", <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#51:2">Isaiah  51:2</a>.<a name=501:14></a> But He says to him, "Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#15:1">Genesis  15:1</a>.<a name=501:15></a> So that God furnishes us in this way as having to encounter what I am speaking of, that is to say the moral conditions, and what may grow out of them too, in the sense of

		violence.<a name=502:1></a> Satan, as has often been remarked, has two weapons; the first is seduction, the other is violence.<a name=502:2></a> And so his names are given twofold in this book, and they both imply violence, murder.<a name=502:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is encouraging to read this chapter in the midst of this book, we may say in the very midst of it, because it speaks of victory.<a name=502:4></a> And I am thinking of the word, "Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:59">1 Corinthians  15:59</a>), without saying what the particular victory is, but God gives it to <i>us</i>.<a name=502:5></a> One of the greatest things for us, in a way, especially in warfare, is the assurance of victory as given to us by God.<a name=502:6></a> Now this chapter, as doubtless you have all noticed, speaks of victory, and poetry enters into it.<a name=502:7></a> "I saw as a glass sea mingled with fire, and those that had gained the victory over the beast, and over its image, and over the number of its name, standing upon the glass sea, having harps of God.<a name=502:8></a> And they sing the song of Moses bondman of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and wonderful are thy works, Lord God Almighty; righteous and true are thy ways, O King of nations.<a name=502:9></a> Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name?<a name=502:10></a>" It is as if they were saying they are not fearing now, they are not in a slavish fear of God, they love God, and because of their love they are in victory.<a name=502:11></a> So it says, "Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name?<a name=502:12></a> for thou only art holy: for all nations shall come and do homage before thee; for thy righteousnesses have been made manifest"; or, as it may read, 'Thy judgments are made manifest'.<a name=502:13></a> We see in that last statement, 'Thy judgments are made manifest', that judgment is a great feature of the book.<a name=502:14></a> And of a great system, it is said that God has judged <i>our</i> judgment (that is the judgment of the saints) upon her, and hence the importance of having a right judgment of all conditions; in fact one sometimes says he has a judgment about everybody that he

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=503>[Page 503]</a>

		knows, and certainly a judgment about the systems that are current; and therefore of this one that I allude to, "God has judged your judgment upon her".<a name=503:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is therefore the moral side in these matters, and it works out on moral principles, moral judgments as to persons and systems, and one may add nations and religious bodies too, because of the importance of the saints knowing things, and having a right judgment, "Judge ye what I say".<a name=503:2></a> So that it is important that each one of us should have a judgment, first about persons, then about systems, then about nations, and other such things.<a name=503:3></a> So that we are conversant with things, as having to do with them even in a judicial sense; we face things and fear not, as the word was to Abraham, "Fear not".<a name=503:4></a> That is to say, face them courageously.<a name=503:5></a> It was the one word to Abraham at that time in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#15">Genesis  15</a>, and the idea is in the great charge to Joshua, "Be thou strong and very courageous", <a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#1:7">Joshua  1:7</a>.<a name=503:6></a> So that we may as well face things as evade them, because things will happen.<a name=503:7></a> God has spoken in a prophetic way in the history of the great revival that we are now having part in; what marked the brethren in the early days was prophecy, and that would mean not simply what we call prophetic ministry, but prophetic events, coming events, so that the prophetic map, as we may call it, was opened up to the brethren, and we can thus look into it and weigh what may be geographical or spiritual, whatever it may be, basing all on the outline of the truth in the prophetic scriptures.<a name=503:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Looking into this book, we are furnished at the very outset with certain weapons, and what are particularly in mind are the seven Spirits of God.<a name=503:9></a> These have to be understood in their connection; that is, it is a prophetic book, a book of symbols, but the Spirit of God is in mind.<a name=503:10></a> And the idea of seven would be to stress the full thought as expressive

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And thus I have called attention to the seven Spirits of God.<a name=504:10></a> The Godhead is alluded to in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1">Revelation  1</a>.<a name=504:11></a> John addresses himself to the assemblies in verse 4.<a name=504:12></a> "John to the seven assemblies which are in Asia: Grace to you, and peace, from him who is, and who was, and who is to come".<a name=504:13></a> The address is to the seven assemblies, showing how much the assembly is in mind in this book.<a name=504:14></a> They are written to by John; the Lord writes seven letters to the assemblies, showing how great the thought of the assembly is in this book, and the Lord is seen towards the end of the chapter, in the midst of the seven assemblies; that is to say, the seven assemblies are seen <i>before</i> the Lord is spoken of.<a name=504:15></a> This shows

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As I said, the assembly is set out in this book, and then the Lord is seen <i>there</i>, in the midst of it.<a name=505:3></a> And so in these verses, as I said, "To the seven assemblies which are in Asia: Grace to you and peace from him who is, and who was, and who is to come, and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne; and from Jesus Christ".<a name=505:4></a> That is, the first reference is to God Himself.<a name=505:5></a> "Who is" is present, and "who was" is historical, and "who is to come" is prophetical.<a name=505:6></a> These are the three aspects in which God is presented to us in this book.<a name=505:7></a> And then the seven Spirits which are before his <i>throne</i>, that is to say the Spirit of God in this sevenfold sense is before His throne; it is a question of the throne and the authority of God, and the power to support it in His Spirit.<a name=505:8></a> And then "from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth", and then the Lord Himself comes in for an ascription of praise by the assemblies.<a name=505:9></a> "To him who loves us, and has washed us from our sins in his blood, and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father, to him be the glory and the might to the ages of ages.<a name=505:10></a> Amen".<a name=505:11></a> I have read all that to keep the subject before us, and especially that the Spirit may be understood.<a name=505:12></a> We have many works on the Holy Spirit, many written works, and much ministry too, much current ministry on the Holy Spirit, but it is of the very greatest importance that we should be conversant with the truth of the Holy Spirit.<a name=505:13></a>

		We should understand too, this sense in which He is seen in this book, that is to say, in a sevenfold character, as if He can be divided in His service, as it were, for He is wonderfully lowly, taking such a lowly place to serve us, having been here for all these centuries, and ready to attend to all matters, and if it be a question of conflict, to attend to all that relates to it; and that we should be in His hands as good soldiers of Jesus Christ.<a name=506:1></a> Now I stress that, dear brethren, especially to the young ones here.<a name=506:2></a> Pardon me for using that well-known phrase, the young ones, as if they are the only ones, but they are in the main what God is relying upon.<a name=506:3></a> He is taking away the old ones; He has a right to do so, and on their side they are able to say, "To depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better".<a name=506:4></a> We often say that, perhaps not always truly, or faithfully, but there is no doubt that the Lord is helping the elder brethren to be in liberty of soul, and to carry on and to be examples to the younger, so that the work may go on in the remnant.<a name=506:5></a> As we had it today, "Shear-Jashub" means a remnant shall return, and so the remnant will work out in the youth, the young men.<a name=506:6></a> "I have written to you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abides in you".<a name=506:7></a> That is a word for youth, dear brethren.<a name=506:8></a> The word of Scripture is, "One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh".<a name=506:9></a> Well, the one that comes is usually the immediate one, the present one, and so I am speaking to you, and urging that each of us should be a good soldier of Jesus Christ, and endure hardships; however they may arise, endure them; be patient in them.<a name=506:10></a> "Be patient therefore, brethren", says James, ".<a name=506:11></a>.<a name=506:12></a>.<a name=506:13></a> for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh", <a href="../bible/James.htm#5:7">James  5:7</a>, 8.<a name=506:14></a>

		And so love is greatly stressed in the Scriptures, and particularly in one chapter, in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#13">1 Corinthians  13</a>.<a name=508:2></a> This chapter enlarges on what love is, as over against other things.<a name=508:3></a> Faith, hope, love; these are three things grouped together.<a name=508:4></a> "The greater of these is love".<a name=508:5></a> Not the greatest, but the greater; that is to say, in that form, two elements are set over against one, and that one is love; it is the greater.<a name=508:6></a> They are the three greatest things, we might say, but "the greater of these is love"; that is, the other two taken together are less than love.<a name=508:7></a> And so if a man has not love, he is nothing.<a name=508:8></a> Whatever he may do, or give, or be in his own mind, he is nothing if he has not love.<a name=508:9></a> It is a very humbling thing that it is so, that if we have not love, we have not anything at all.<a name=508:10></a> That is the chapter that I have alluded to; it is a love chapter, and it is a chapter to stress what I am saying.<a name=508:11></a> So the word is here, "I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass".<a name=508:12></a> Now I ask you, dear brethren, to weigh the things that are mentioned here, the specific things that are mentioned, and that these men that are alluded to are persons that have gotten the victory over them, things which are all hostile.<a name=508:13></a> "A sea of glass mingled with fire, and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass".<a name=508:14></a> I need not enlarge on the idea of glass, it conveys the idea of transparency, which is one of the first features that are proper to christianity, that we are transparent, that we are bold in telling the truth, and in working out the truth in our lives, and in having to encounter these elements of the beast,

		Now I venture to bring forward John himself in this book, the beloved apostle; he is not called that here, he is just a prophet here, he is never called an apostle in this book; he is a prophet.<a name=509:16></a> But in the first case we find him falling down as dead in the presence of the Lord Jesus, and it was right; the Lord did not reprove him for that, it was reverential.<a name=509:17></a> He saw the wonders in which He appears in the first chapter, and he fell down before the Lord as dead.<a name=509:18></a> The Lord did not reprove him for that.<a name=509:19></a> But in chapter 19: 10, he falls down to worship an angel; he is full of courage, and is used of God to assert victory for the saints, yet he falls down to worship an angel.<a name=509:20></a> That is to say, he fails in that in which he has overcome; and the angel himself before whom he fell has to reprove him; so that, dear brethren, we may defend things and condemn what is not right, and yet we may give way to the very thing we are condemning.<a name=509:21></a> And so it is, that in this chapter which I allude to.<a name=509:22></a> John falls down to worship an angel; that is to say, he is idolatrous.<a name=509:23></a> Think of that, that such a man as he, and such a vessel is used in this book; for the book is given to John.<a name=509:24></a> It is given to Christ by the Father, but the Lord gives it to John; "he .<a name=509:25></a>.<a name=509:26></a>.<a name=509:27></a> signified it .<a name=509:28></a>.<a name=509:29></a>.<a name=509:30></a> unto his servant John".<a name=509:31></a> And

		John is found, as I said, in this wrong attitude for the moment, showing how easily we may give way; after having succeeded victoriously in maintaining what is right, we may momentarily give way to what is wrong, even the very thing that we have been condemning.<a name=510:1></a> I warn the dear brethren as to this, to stand firm in what is right.<a name=510:2></a> As Paul said, whatever you think of us, <i>you</i> do what is right.<a name=510:3></a> So the point is to be right in what we are dealing with, and not to give way, even for a moment.<a name=510:4></a> And so in the last chapter of the book we have the same thing.<a name=510:5></a> John falls down to worship the angel; he is again idolatrous.<a name=510:6></a> You can understand that it is very far from me to say anything against a great servant like John, but it is written for our learning.<a name=510:7></a> How easily we may give way for a moment, and do great damage in giving way when at first we hold firmly to the right.<a name=510:8></a> So that John is seen twice over in this book as idolatrous, and has to be reproved for it.<a name=510:9></a> But when he falls down before the Lord there is no reproof, he is in the presence of a divine Person.<a name=510:10></a> That is the great difference here, dear brethren, the difference between an angel and a divine Person; the worship of angels is idolatry, but not the worship of a divine Person.<a name=510:11></a> We are to worship God, we are to worship Christ, and I might add that the Spirit too is included in the subject of worship.<a name=510:12></a> We are to maintain in our souls a right estimate of the blessed Spirit of God, especially in the way in which He is seen in this book, in the sevenfold manner, the seven Spirits of God.<a name=510:13></a>

		Well now, in what I am speaking of in chapter 15, it says "they sing".<a name=510:14></a> I am reading about overcoming.<a name=510:15></a> They have overcome all these elements, and we are in the very midst of all these elements.<a name=510:16></a> I am not going to speak in any unseemly way, I am not going to give any reason or cause for the enemy to speak reproachfully of what I am saying, dear brethren; but I am seeking now to give you the truth,

		in a concealed, or I might say limited way, but yet to give it that you should have it before you and be ready for any emergency that might arise, to be strong and very courageous.<a name=511:1></a> And so the result is in verse 3, "they sing the song of Moses".<a name=511:2></a> That is to say, the brethren have a song -- It is not the Marseillaise, it is not any such thing, not any party matter at all; it is the song of Moses.<a name=511:3></a> "They sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb".<a name=511:4></a> That is to say, Moses is recognised according to his mediatorial position in the service of God, and they sing his song; it was a song of victory, possibly <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15">Exodus  15</a>, I suppose, but they sing it; and then the song of the Lamb.<a name=511:5></a> How wonderfully honoured he was as associated with the Lamb.<a name=511:6></a> That is what God would do for us; the assembly has the nearest place to Christ, the nearest place to God in the whole universe.<a name=511:7></a> So you see with Moses how he is honoured in that same sense, as with the Lamb; that his song is sung with the song of the Lamb.<a name=511:8></a> And so it is "the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb".<a name=511:9></a> And the song is this, "Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints".<a name=511:10></a> That is, all this is attributed to God; He is the King of saints.<a name=511:11></a> Or it may be the King of nations, but He is the King of saints anyway, which is a very suggestive thing for us all, because I am speaking to saints.<a name=511:12></a> I am not speaking to unconverted people, I am here to speak to the saints, and I am speaking to them in the sense that God is the King of saints.<a name=511:13></a> So that we are subject to God, but still we have a song -- These persons alluded to have a song, and it is a song of victory, it is the song of Moses, and it is the song of the Lamb.<a name=511:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so it goes on in verse 4, "Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify they name?<a name=511:15></a> for thou only art holy, for all nations shall come and worship

		before thee".<a name=512:1></a> Notice how the worship of God is brought in; it is insisted on because that is the idea of the book; it is a book of insistence on what is right; and this is quite right here, and insisted on as right, that "all nations shall come and worship before thee".<a name=512:2></a> Now as I said John failed in this very thing, and we are all apt to fail in this very thing.<a name=512:3></a> If he did, we are all apt to fail in a thing we have condemned, we are apt to fall in with it even for a moment, and do damage.<a name=512:4></a> But here there is nothing of that.<a name=512:5></a> It says, "Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name?<a name=512:6></a> for thou only art holy, for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy judgments are made manifest".<a name=512:7></a> That is to say God is glorified by the song here, because His judgments are made manifest.<a name=512:8></a> As I said at the beginning, it is so important that we should have a right judgment of everything.<a name=512:9></a> And that if God's judgments are made manifest, to stand by them; if it means conflict, stand by them; if we need to suffer, stand by them.<a name=512:10></a> They are the judgments of God; they go through; they go through into the lake of fire too.<a name=512:11></a> But here it is the seven last plagues of God that are aimed against western Europe, and inclusive of Australasia too, because Australasia is just the outcome of Europe, and the seven last plagues of God are aimed against the renunciation of christianity.<a name=512:12></a> It is an awful thing, what is coming in.<a name=512:13></a> It is all around us, not only here, but in Europe and America, it is all around; the renunciation of the truth of christianity.<a name=512:14></a> So that in one moment the Lord will take away His own, and then the whole matter will be just a shell of wickedness.<a name=512:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now you may say, I am speaking strongly, and perhaps you say there is no need for it, but there is need for it, because God would have us to stand up about things, for His rights, and His services.<a name=512:16></a> And so here the thing is asserted to be right, for it says,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=513>[Page 513]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"For thou only art holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy judgments are made manifest".<a name=513:1></a> The thing is manifest, and therefore it is a question of standing up for these judgments of God, whatever they may be, and so the victory.<a name=513:2></a> That is the victory of these people -- dear people they are -- that are alluded to here.<a name=513:3></a> It says, "I saw .<a name=513:4></a>.<a name=513:5></a>.<a name=513:6></a> a sea of glass mingled with fire, and them that had gotten the victory over the beast".<a name=513:7></a> We may say blessed be their name, because they are sufferers, and the Lamb is a Sufferer.<a name=513:8></a> The very title, Lamb, is related to suffering.<a name=513:9></a> And the song of the Lamb, was the song of a Sufferer.<a name=513:10></a> And so, dear brethren, I am just, as it were, calling upon you to stand up for the truth.<a name=513:11></a> I cannot very well do better than this tonight.<a name=513:12></a> I am just about to leave this city, and this country shortly, and I would seek to leave with and impress on the brethren the importance of standing up for what is right; whatever others may do, as Paul says, you do what is right.<a name=513:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so the end is in verse 7, that "one of the four beasts" (or living creatures) "gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever.<a name=513:14></a> And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled".<a name=513:15></a> That is to say, the temple is closed until these terrible things happen; the service of God will be resumed in another world altogether; "that world and the resurrection".<a name=513:16></a> But the temple is seen as closed.<a name=513:17></a> I believe that is what is in mind; it is a prophetic matter, and the temple of God will be closed until these matters are fulfilled; and then God will take up other threads of service in what is called the millennial world; that world and the resurrection.<a name=513:18></a> God will do that; in the meantime He is continuing, and His temple is still open; we have

		part in it; we are indeed ourselves, as christians, part of the temple of God.<a name=514:1></a> Paul says, "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?<a name=514:2></a>" So that the temple is still open, but it will soon be closed, and that terrible shell of wickedness left in western Europe, to say nothing about the East.<a name=514:3></a> I am speaking now about the West because it is a question of the renunciation of christianity.<a name=514:4></a> That is what is coming, as Paul says to the Thessalonians, that the coming of the Lord will not be until there be an apostasy, and then the man of sin shall appear.<a name=514:5></a> That is all imminent, dear brethren; the Lord may come now, at any time and take us to be with Him.<a name=514:6></a> But then all this will happen.<a name=514:7></a> Is it not worth while to have it in mind and be ready for it?<a name=514:8></a> So that while the temple of God remains open, as it is open yet, be present in it, continue on in the service of God, and do what you can in His service, in the gospel and otherwise.<a name=514:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So I leave all this, dear brethren, with you in the Lord's name, that there may be a fulfilment of it in the youth, according to John's letter to the young men, "I write to you, young men", and then he says, "I have written to you", as if he said, I write to you today, but I wrote to you before.<a name=514:10></a> And it may be that things have come to us and we have forgotten them, and they have to be repeated; and that is how graciously John carries on with the young men.<a name=514:11></a> "I have written to you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.<a name=514:12></a> Love not the world, nor the things in the world .<a name=514:13></a>.<a name=514:14></a>.<a name=514:15></a> because all that is in the world .<a name=514:16></a>.<a name=514:17></a>.<a name=514:18></a> is not of the Father".<a name=514:19></a> So that we are set up in that way by John's exhortations, and then as I said, we have the warning of him even falling into idolatry, if even for a moment, after all his steadfastness and faithfulness in insisting on right in these wonderful pages of the book of Revelation.<a name=514:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is in the light in which this meeting is held that I ventured to read this scripture, remembering that the local assembly has proved her place in the service of ministry.<a name=515:1></a> In <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:2">1 Corinthians  1:2</a> that assembly is addressed as "the assembly of God which is in Corinth", meaning that it is the local company that is in mind.<a name=515:2></a> Corinth being a city, a city in which the Lord appeared to Paul the apostle and said, "No one shall set upon thee to injure thee; because I have much people in this city", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#18:10">Acts  18:10</a>.<a name=515:3></a> The Lord indicated, therefore, that He was singling out Corinth as a city in which He should have an assembly, and it should be large.<a name=515:4></a> There were gifts in that assembly according to the first chapter, and God had set them there; moreover, it is said in chapter 12, before the matter of gift is mentioned, that no one could say, "Lord Jesus", unless in the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=515:5></a> Thus the assembly there was signalised by the presence of the Spirit in it, and the Spirit would make much of the Lord Jesus.<a name=515:6></a> He would say, "Lord Jesus", in those who were ministering.<a name=515:7></a> Then again, it is suggested in chapter 14 that if the whole assembly should come together in one place, room should be made for prophetic ministry, the prophets were to be free to speak, for God had set them in the assembly.<a name=515:8></a> The order in which the gifts were set there is apostles, prophets, teachers, and so on, so that the assembly was properly furnished for the exercise of ministry, and, of course, ministry was and is for the edifying of the body of Christ; clearly not to make much of any minister especially, but to edify the body of Christ, "until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at the full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:13">Ephesians  4:13</a>.<a name=515:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in the light of all these facts, I ventured to read these verses in 2 Chronicles, because they furnish opportunity to call attention to a section of Scripture that is freighted with spiritual power, with spirituality, and with personality distinguished by God in His testimony.<a name=516:1></a> It is the beginning of the second book, the first book closing with an account of the end of David's reign.<a name=516:2></a> According to 1 Kings, David was enfeebled by age, but evidently in the closing chapters of the first book of Chronicles he has been strengthened specially by God, and we are reminded in this of God's special interest in those who minister the truth to the saints, as is said here, "thy great people"; not that the Spirit of God would eulogise the saints specially, but if He says "thy great people", He refers to them in an abstract sense; that is, as those who are born of God, redeemed by the blood of Christ, and indwelt by the Holy Spirit; they are, therefore, great.<a name=516:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		David was evidently strengthened of God to speak to them at this juncture.<a name=516:4></a> The first book, as I said, gives us the closing ministry of David.<a name=516:5></a> He is there recorded as having died, and certain ones wrote his life, showing how important a minister he was.<a name=516:6></a> It is said, "Now David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.<a name=516:7></a> And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years: he reigned seven years in Hebron, and he reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem.<a name=516:8></a> And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour; and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.<a name=516:9></a> And the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer; with all his reign and his might, and the times that passed over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries", <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#29:26">1 Chronicles  29:26</a> - 30.<a name=516:10></a> Thus, according to the way Scripture presents the facts, he was the most distinguished

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		than up to that time who had reigned in Israel, and in his closing remarks recorded in <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#29">1 Chronicles  29</a>, he speaks of God as the Head; it is a very remarkable thing that he should speak thus of God.<a name=517:1></a> We speak of Christ as the Head, which is right, of course, for He is Head of the body, the assembly; but David spoke of God as Head, and in this way enriched the remarkable address that he made to God in the sight of all the people.<a name=517:2></a> And so, as I said, the section affords great richness.<a name=517:3></a> Anyone who has read it, that is to say, the closing chapters of the first book and then the opening chapters of the second, which speak of Solomon, will know that what I say is true, that we are dealing with one of the richest sections of Scripture, and I believe that it is in keeping with the facts here tonight to say that we have recently come through a time marked by peculiar richness of fellowship and ministry.<a name=517:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So I am encouraged to refer to all this, that the dear brethren may be encouraged, especially all the young men who are here.<a name=517:5></a> I do not speak of the young women, because I am speaking rather for the moment of gift, having in mind the importance of gift.<a name=517:6></a> It is said in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:7">Ephesians  4:7</a>, "But to each one of us has been given grace according to the measure of the gift of the Christ".<a name=517:7></a> But then there are specific gifts to which I have already referred, that is to say, "some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints; with a view to the work of the ministry, with a view to the edifying of the body of Christ".<a name=517:8></a> So that as I said, the young men are in mind in this word.<a name=517:9></a> There are old men here, of course, and David represents the old.<a name=517:10></a> He dies, for God has a right to His children and God is taking him even as He took Enoch.<a name=517:11></a> But David, representing the old men, was not jealous of his son.<a name=517:12></a> He knew from God Himself that Solomon was to reign

		in his stead, and he had no jealousy in his heart towards him.<a name=518:1></a> That is a matter also that all young brethren should be concerned about, that they may not in any way be jealous about their elder brethren.<a name=518:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To confirm what I say, I refer now to the second book of Kings which presents to us the successor of Elijah, that is Elisha.<a name=518:3></a> It is said, Elisha poured water on the hands of Elijah (<a href="../bible/2Kings.htm#3:11">2 Kings  3:11</a>), which would mean that he was not at all jealous of his great superior who was taken to heaven.<a name=518:4></a> He aspired to be like Elijah, but he was not jealous of him.<a name=518:5></a> He poured water on his hands, so as to make his ministry better, and that is the spirit that should lay hold of all the young men here; not to be jealous in the least degree of the elder, but if possible to render their ministry more effective in their old age, because old age has its advantages.<a name=518:6></a> It has its disadvantages, as most of us who are old know, but it has its advantages; that is to say, it has the advantage of experience, experience with the brethren, experience with God too, which would mark the twenty-four elders in the book of Revelation.<a name=518:7></a> That thought is taken from David.<a name=518:8></a> It was he who inaugurated the idea of twenty-four in the courses of the Levites and the priests and the workers of all kinds under his rule.<a name=518:9></a> They were divided into twenty-four courses in general, and that was to facilitate and to implement their service.<a name=518:10></a> It is a most important section in that sense, because it leads into the book of Revelation, which is the closing book of the New Testament, in which David has a peculiar place, the Lord Himself referring to him, speaking of Himself as He that has the key of David, showing what a place David had in the divine mind.<a name=518:11></a> In the end of that book the Lord says, "<i>I</i> am the root and offspring of David".<a name=518:12></a> That is to say, He was greater than David, as the root of David, but then He was the offspring of David, and therefore David comes in for a great place, as indicated

		Now as to youthfulness.<a name=519:2></a> In the twenty-third chapter of the first book it says, "And David was old and full of days; and he made Solomon his son king over Israel.<a name=519:3></a> And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.<a name=519:4></a> And the Levites were numbered from thirty years old and upward; and their number, by their polls, man by man, was thirty-eight thousand.<a name=519:5></a> Of these, twenty-four thousand were to preside over the work of the house of Jehovah; and six thousand were officers and judges; and four thousand were doorkeepers; and four thousand praised Jehovah with the instruments which I made, said David, to praise therewith.<a name=519:6></a> And David divided them into courses according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari", <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#23:1">1 Chronicles  23:1</a> - 6.<a name=519:7></a> These are features of David's government, David's service in Israel.<a name=519:8></a> He was an old man, and knew he was to be replaced by his son.<a name=519:9></a> Earlier he had had in his mind to build the house, and Nathan said to him, "Do all that is in thy heart; for God is with thee", <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#17:2">1 Chronicles  17:2</a>.<a name=519:10></a> But Nathan spoke too fast, for Jehovah intended to set up Solomon instead of David.<a name=519:11></a> David, hearing this, was quite subject, and now he is ready to make his son, Solomon, king in his stead.<a name=519:12></a> This is to say, we have David and Solomon together on the throne, showing that there is no thought of rivalry, which is one of the most baneful things that can be amongst us, especially in ministry.<a name=519:13></a> The old and the young are to serve together, and the young are to implement the service of the old in due course.<a name=519:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so, dear brethren, I have been encouraged as I said, to read from this section, because it brings out David in this peculiar light, in this peculiar way in which God would honour him.<a name=519:15></a> He honoured him in a degree more than any before him, but Solomon

	<div class="paragraph">
		even more; that is to say, David had to take account of this, but yet he made Solomon his son king.<a name=520:1></a> "And David was old and full of days; and he made Solomon his son king over Israel".<a name=520:2></a> So that he and Solomon were on the throne together.<a name=520:3></a> It is to bring out the unjealous attitude of a spiritual man, and that is the point that is in one's mind.<a name=520:4></a> There are the elder brethren here, and we are thankful, too, for the young ones.<a name=520:5></a> I can see from where I am standing a great many faces of young men.<a name=520:6></a> There is a great need for them, and much room for them, and the elder ones are not at all jealous of them; they are making way for them.<a name=520:7></a> But, at the same time, the elder have to be supported, and that is how Elisha supported Elijah, in that he poured water on the hands of the prophet.<a name=520:8></a> He would implement his service by refreshing him, and that is the point that is in one's mind.<a name=520:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So we get now in this passage in the second book this wonderful prayer, as if God is being honoured by Solomon.<a name=520:10></a> He said to Solomon, "Ask what I shall give thee.<a name=520:11></a> And Solomon said to God, Thou hast shewn unto David my father great loving-kindness, and has made me king in his stead.<a name=520:12></a> Now, Jehovah Elohim, let thy word unto David my father be firm; for thou hast made me king over a people numerous as the dust of the earth.<a name=520:13></a> Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this thy great people?<a name=520:14></a>".<a name=520:15></a> Now God is above and Solomon is below, but Solomon has it proposed to him by Jehovah that he should ask, and that is the point that I would make now, so as to make much of the opportunities of prayer.<a name=520:16></a> The need is great and wide, and the labourers are comparatively few, and there is therefore room; and God is ready to give.<a name=520:17></a> "Ask, and it shall be given you".<a name=520:18></a> And so here, Solomon made this remarkable prayer: "Give me now wisdom and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=521>[Page 521]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge, this thy great people?<a name=521:1></a> And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thy heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of them that hate thee, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked for thyself wisdom and knowledge, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king, wisdom and knowledge are granted unto thee", <a href="../bible/2Chronicles.htm#1:10">2 Chronicles  1:10</a> - 12.<a name=521:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that is my advice in closing as to all these dear young brethren who are here.<a name=521:3></a> The thing is to ask of God whatever is needed, "ask of God, who gives to all freely and reproaches not" (<a href="../bible/James.htm#1:5">James  1:5</a>), because of the need.<a name=521:4></a> The first thing is to find what need there is, and then seek to meet it, and God will not fail to give us the gift that is required.<a name=521:5></a> "Desire earnestly the greater gifts", we are told.<a name=521:6></a> Why not have the greater gifts?<a name=521:7></a> God has them and has furnished them.<a name=521:8></a> I believe the Spirit has brought them all down here, and they are to be distributed as they are needed, and it is a question therefore of calculating what the need is, and then asking of God.<a name=521:9></a> Ask of God what will meet the need as you see it, and then be doing; that is the idea.<a name=521:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so, as I was saying, God says, "Wisdom and knowledge are granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches and wealth and honour, such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee, neither shall any after thee have the like".<a name=521:11></a> A great opportunity is open to us.<a name=521:12></a> I have been in this country now for a considerable time, and I have seen great evidence of interest among the saints, more than I have ever seen before, and it is a great encouragement and stimulation.<a name=521:13></a> I am speaking, not to myself or the elder brethren, but to the younger ones, so that, dear brethren, as discerning the need that is evident, we may ask God for what will meet
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=522>[Page 522]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the need, because a great work is opening up to us.<a name=522:1></a> I might mention South Africa, where I have been also, for the work of God is progressing in all these countries, to say nothing of Europe and America, but now I am just speaking of these southern countries.<a name=522:2></a> There is a great work in progress and there is a great need for workmen, and the Lord would thrust us into the field.<a name=522:3></a> I am not saying that we should give up our employment; I do not believe we should.<a name=522:4></a> I am rather hesitant about that.<a name=522:5></a> I have not done it myself, and I believe, generally, young men are safer at their employment, but they should seek to see what is needed and apply themselves to the work, and the Lord will give them understanding and what is needed in the way of gift and ability.<a name=522:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One was encouraged to speak in this admonitory way, dear brethren, to suggest something that I see is needed, and that is for the young men to get to God and find out by discernment, by prayer and watchfulness, what is really needed amongst the saints.<a name=522:7></a> There is a great people in these southern countries.<a name=522:8></a> Are they properly cared for?<a name=522:9></a> Is there enough ministry?<a name=522:10></a> Is there example, for that is, perhaps, the most needful thing of all, example for others as to what is right, and especially in the matter of discipline, how discipline is to be carried on; for it was the way of God, I believe, from the days of Enoch, the seventh from Adam, that there should be discipline.<a name=522:11></a> His name signifies discipline, and the thought that is before one is that we should seek to know how to carry on discipline.<a name=522:12></a> David knew how to do it.<a name=522:13></a> He was, as I said, a ruler.<a name=522:14></a> He reigned forty years, which is remarkable; and we are told where he reigned.<a name=522:15></a> We are told too, the number of children he had, and so forth; so we are to learn from example, from what we see in him.<a name=522:16></a> Now Solomon has replaced him.<a name=522:17></a> He is set on the throne,

	<div class="paragraph">
		and David has gone, the Lord having taken him, and Solomon elects to pray to God.<a name=523:1></a> God says, 'You had better ask, Solomon.<a name=523:2></a> Ask!<a name=523:3></a>' The Lord says in the gospels, "Ask, and it shall be given to you .<a name=523:4></a>.<a name=523:5></a>.<a name=523:6></a> knock, and it shall be opened to you", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#11:9">Luke  11:9</a>.<a name=523:7></a> In that wonderful chapter He says if we ask the Father He gives us the Holy Spirit.<a name=523:8></a> "How much rather shall the Father who is of heaven give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?<a name=523:9></a>" Think of the magnitude of that gift!<a name=523:10></a> You may say, That is for young people; but it is a matter of the ability we should have for ministry, as well as for the young people.<a name=523:11></a> Young brothers and sisters, of course, need the Holy Spirit, and that is one of the first questions that should be asked of young people wishing to come into fellowship, 'Have you received the Holy Spirit?<a name=523:12></a>' But if you are to serve in the ministry, it is supremely important that we should ask, and be sure that we have the Holy Spirit, not merely as a theory but as a fact.<a name=523:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So at Ephesus, one of the greatest fields Paul laboured in, he said to the twelve men, "Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed?<a name=523:14></a> And they said to him, We did not even hear if the Holy Spirit was come", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#19:2">Acts  19:2</a>.<a name=523:15></a> They say that they did not know.<a name=523:16></a> So we must be on our guard that we are not ignorant of what is needed in the service of God, and be sure that we have the Holy Spirit, with all the wealth that comes in in this connection.<a name=523:17></a> Jehovah says to Solomon, "Because this was in thy heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of them that hate thee, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked for thyself wisdom and knowledge, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king: wisdom and knowledge are granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches and wealth and honour, such as

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So I close with these thoughts, dear brethren, and again refer to what I have said, that there is the need of ability for service, the need of instruction in discipline, and first how to discipline myself.<a name=524:2></a> That is the first thing to learn, how to discipline oneself, how to keep oneself right, and then to be an example to others.<a name=524:3></a> As Paul says to Timothy, "Faithful men such as shall be competent to instruct others also", <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:2">2 Timothy  2:2</a>.<a name=524:4></a> There is a need, not only of being instructed oneself, but of instructing others, that we may be able to impart something in the way of teaching or instruction to our younger brethren and sisters.<a name=524:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I now refer to the sisters, because they are needed, and one has often questioned why it is that we have no gift among the sisters.<a name=524:6></a> Philip the evangelist had four daughters who prophesied, and while I have often spoken of this I repeat it, as I feel it is necessary now to bring it forward, that there is very little, if any, gift among the sisters.<a name=524:7></a> Yet there was gift at the beginning, and the women are told in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11">1 Corinthians  11</a>what to do if they are praying or prophesying; they are to keep their heads covered.<a name=524:8></a> That is a remarkable chapter.<a name=524:9></a> Before we come to the truth of the Lord's supper we have the thought of headship.<a name=524:10></a> It says, that every woman praying or prophesying is to have her head covered.<a name=524:11></a> Well, one may say, that is nothing at all; but <i>it is something</i>.<a name=524:12></a> What God enjoins <i>is</i> something and cannot be ignored, and if we ignore it we shall never prophesy.<a name=524:13></a> What flows out from it is gift, and I am only just mentioning, I might say hesitatingly, the thought of sisters having gift; but why not?<a name=524:14></a> If they had it at the beginning why not now?<a name=524:15></a> I put that question, why not now?<a name=524:16></a> The Spirit of God is here, and I verily believe He has brought all the gifts with Him from heaven.<a name=524:17></a>

		"Having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this which ye behold and hear", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:33">Acts  2:33</a>.<a name=525:1></a> It was a question of gift, and those persons were used to convict people, who recognised them as those who had knowledge.<a name=525:2></a> They enquired from the other apostles, as well as Peter, and they said, "What shall we do, brethren?<a name=525:3></a>" Peter is ready to tell them what to do.<a name=525:4></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I have in mind is to speak of what is seen in the first scripture, namely, "simplicity as to the Christ".<a name=526:1></a> The word 'simplicity' has to be understood in its context, even as every word of Scripture has to be understood.<a name=526:2></a> We are not to add to Christ in our thoughts or ornament Him in any way according to man.<a name=526:3></a> The circumstances at Corinth called forth this expression of feeling from the apostle, for corrupting influences were at work there.<a name=526:4></a> In the first epistle the temple of God was in danger of being corrupted, the corruption implying destruction in a moral sense.<a name=526:5></a> And so here the apostle was concerned, because a corrupting element was affecting the minds of the saints in regard to Christ, which would result in something being added to Him in the minds of the saints, as if He was not to be regarded and spoken of and loved <i>as He was</i>.<a name=526:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord has been treated indifferently throughout the history of the assembly.<a name=526:7></a> The danger the apostle had in mind soon became prevalent, the danger of adding to what scripture says of Him, as if Christ in Himself as presented in testimony was not just enough.<a name=526:8></a> Other things, and ideas, certain ornamentations according to man, became the fashion, and this has spread abroad throughout christendom, so that the true Christ has been largely lost to view.<a name=526:9></a> If the clergy were questioned as to Him, the answers would be varied and generally beside the mark, even as when the Lord raised the question as to what men were saying about Him; however respectful the answers may be, there will be few that are not largely short of the truth.<a name=526:10></a> It is unquestionably true that corruption is abroad, corruption of the minds of men, and of nominal christians, as to the truth of Christ.<a name=526:11></a> The danger has

		always been current even in such a spiritual meeting as at Colosse, for it was a spiritual meeting.<a name=527:1></a> The apostle Paul could say that although he had not been there, he rejoiced in beholding their order.<a name=527:2></a> He did not need to write to them as to their public order.<a name=527:3></a> It was right there, and it was a joy to him having heard of the conditions among the saints.<a name=527:4></a> It was a faithful minister and one of the local men at Colosse who had been to the apostle and had given him an account of the conditions of the assembly, giving him certain satisfaction because the order of God marked them; they had much beside that that was of God, but they were in danger of admitting the thought that something could be added that had not been presented to them already in Christ.<a name=527:5></a> He was concerned about them and it was one of the principal burdens of the apostle to call to mind and point out the danger of anyone practising among them philosophy and vain deceit.<a name=527:6></a> That involved what is called the rudiments or elements of the world, and the same word is used to the Galatians in which the word despicable or beggarly is added: "beggarly elements".<a name=527:7></a> The Spirit of God pours contempt on these elements, and yet the proposal was that they should be added, as though the Christ who was presented in the gospel was not just the full Christ, but that something was needed additional to Him.<a name=527:8></a> That, dear brethren, is what I have in mind.<a name=527:9></a> That was in the apostle's mind when he said "I have espoused you unto one man".<a name=527:10></a> That Man was Christ without any human ornamentation, without any attempt to make Him different.<a name=527:11></a>

		At Corinth there was a threefold presentation of Christ, the Son of God.<a name=527:12></a> He was preached among them, and Silvanus and Timotheus had part in the preaching at Corinth during those eighteen months in which the apostle laboured in that city, and it was the Son of God that was preached.<a name=527:13></a> The Son of God

		Now I go on to the third passage to show how all this was cumulative, that the disciples were quietly learning with Jesus alone with themselves.<a name=531:16></a> That is how the verse reads, "Jesus alone with themselves".<a name=531:17></a> Let us never leave that out, "with themselves".<a name=531:18></a> As becoming man, the thought is that He is to have others with Him.<a name=531:19></a> He is great enough to fill the universe, to fill eternity, but the divine intent was to come into the economy so as to develop a system of things full of men, replete with humanity according to God.<a name=531:20></a> How great a thing it is to be brought into this already; the word is <i>themselves</i>, that is, <i>ourselves</i>.<a name=531:21></a> They themselves or ourselves is a word of importance in the New Testament and I am increasingly fond of it.<a name=531:22></a> I would urge every young christian
