		In this book an attempt has been made to meet a desire, often expressed, for an account of the way the Lord has taken, since the beginning of the nineteenth century, to recover the truth of the assembly given to the apostle Paul -- which was so soon lost in accordance with the Spirit's express warning as given us in <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#4:1">1 Timothy  4:1</a> - 3 and <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#3:1">2 Timothy  3:1</a> - 5 -- and to maintain it against successive efforts of Satan to overthrow it.<a name=1:2></a> A very useful book on these lines was issued by the late Mr.<a name=1:3></a> G.<a name=1:4></a> W.<a name=1:5></a> Ware, but it had only a private and limited circulation, and is not now generally available, besides which the course of time since it was issued has brought further recovery of truth, and further opposition to it, which have been treated of in the following pages.<a name=1:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The object in view has been, as far as possible, to emphasize the particular truth that was involved in each conflict, rather than to dwell unnecessarily on history and personalities, and the method adopted has been to draw largely on letters written by those who were alive at the time of the occurrences in question, or who were well acquainted with them.<a name=1:7></a> In the process of compiling this history, much assistance has been derived from the book by Mr.<a name=1:8></a> Ware above referred to.<a name=1:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is hoped that the perusal of this history will have the effect of stimulating faithfulness to the truth of God on the part of all who read it, the history itself affording the most encouraging evidence of the faithfulness of our Lord Jesus Christ and of the Holy Spirit, through all the years of conflict, in maintaining the truth in its purity notwithstanding every attack upon it.<a name=1:10></a><br>A.<a name=1:11></a>J.<a name=1:12></a>G.<a name=1:13></a> 1951

		INTRODUCTION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was in 1827 and the years immediately following that there first came into evidence the existence in many different places of a work of God, very small in its beginnings, which shewed itself in saints who were feeling dissatisfied with the state of things in the Established Church and dissenting bodies standing apart from the same, and meeting in private houses for the breaking of bread.<a name=2:1></a> At first the companies so doing often only numbered three or four, and were ignorant that similar companies in other places were doing the same.<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this work of God, no servant of the Lord can be identified as being specially used; the Spirit of God was operating sovereignly in the hearts of many saints, widely separated from one another, apart from the instrumentality of any one particular servant.<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In 1827 Mr.<a name=2:4></a> J.<a name=2:5></a> N.<a name=2:6></a> Darby was a curate in County Wicklow, Ireland, but was much disturbed in mind by the action of the then Archbishop of Dublin, who charged his clergy to petition the Government for protection from molestation by Roman Catholics in carrying out their parochial duties.<a name=2:7></a> In the exercise of soul which this occasioned, the Lord shewed him that He was Head of the assembly, which was His body, united to Him by the Holy Spirit, and that each believer was a member of that body.<a name=2:8></a> This truth laid hold of him, and as the sovereign right of the Spirit in the assembly to use whom He would became clear to him from Scripture, the error of the clerical principle became apparent to him, and he left the Established Church in 1828, about the same time writing the paper, "The Nature and Unity of the Church of Christ".<a name=2:9></a> The equally important paper,

		<a name=3>[Page 3]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"The Notion of a Clergyman -- Dispensationally the Sin against the Holy Ghost", was written about that time also, though not published till some years later.<a name=3:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the years immediately following 1827 the work of God above referred to spread rapidly, and Mr.<a name=3:2></a> Darby soon became recognised as one whom the Lord was using in an outstanding way to open up His mind regarding the assembly.<a name=3:3></a> Besides Mr.<a name=3:4></a> J.<a name=3:5></a> N.<a name=3:6></a> Darby, Mr.<a name=3:7></a> J.<a name=3:8></a> G.<a name=3:9></a> Bellett, Mr.<a name=3:10></a> G.<a name=3:11></a> V.<a name=3:12></a>&nbsp; Wigram, Capt.<a name=3:13></a> Hall, Dr.<a name=3:14></a> E.<a name=3:15></a> Cronin, Mr.<a name=3:16></a> F.<a name=3:17></a> Hutchinson and Sir Edward Denny, among others, were identified with the movement, and also from 1833, though then only eighteen years of age, Mr.<a name=3:18></a> J.<a name=3:19></a> B.<a name=3:20></a> Stoney.<a name=3:21></a> Mr.<a name=3:22></a> B.<a name=3:23></a> W.<a name=3:24></a> Newton was also identified with it in its early beginnings.<a name=3:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It has always been the case that Satan has sought to oppose and spoil what God is doing, and never has it been more apparent, save in his unceasing opposition to the Lord Jesus in the days of His flesh, than in his opposition to the operations of the Holy Spirit in forming the assembly down here as a heavenly vessel, the body of Christ, united to Him, and taking character only from Him.<a name=3:26></a> The <i>Acts</i> of the Apostles shews how unceasingly the labours of the apostles, and especially the apostle Paul, to whom the ministry of the assembly was committed, were opposed by Satan, either by violence or by sedulously introducing elements of corruption, and the condition into which the assembly fell, even while the apostles were still alive, as clearly indicated in the second epistle to Timothy, the second epistle of Peter, the epistle of Jude, and the first three chapters of Revelation, shews how successful that opposition ultimately became.<a name=3:27></a> At the time of the Reformation God intervened in power to establish the truth of justification by faith, and to bring in deliverance, over an extended area, from much of the pernicious influence of Rome, but the Reformers

		never accorded to the Holy Spirit practically the place that was His due, and as a consequence the clerical principle was never overthrown, and the state of Protestantism has long since been that described by the Lord in His address to Sardis, "Thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead", <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:1">Revelation  3:1</a>.<a name=4:1></a> In these circumstances it is not surprising that when God again intervened, in the first half of the nineteenth century, to recover the truth of the assembly in its distinctiveness and heavenly character, and to establish it in power among His saints, the devil should renew his opposition, and maintain it ceaselessly, and the pages that follow are intended to give a broad account of the way that such opposition has been met by the Lord, and of the truth that has been established as a result of each successive conflict.<a name=4:2></a>

		EVENTS AT PLYMOUTH, AND SUBSEQUENTLY AT THE BETHESDA MEETING IN BRISTOL, 1844 TO 1849

		The facts relating to these matters, and the principles involved, are clearly set forth in the following: --

		(a) Letter by Mr.<a name=5:1></a> W.<a name=5:2></a> Trotter, dated July 15th, 1849.<a name=5:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Beloved Brother, -- In your favour of the 26th ult.<a name=5:4></a>, you say you have received Mr.<a name=5:5></a> Juke's printed letter to the Leeds and Otley gatherings, from which you learn that something has occurred at Bethesda, rendering it in your judgment needful for us to separate therefrom, and you wish me to furnish you with all that has been printed on all sides.<a name=5:6></a> The fact is, however, that the present question arises out of others which have exercised the souls of brethren for years; and it would be impossible for you to understand the one without some acquaintance with the others.<a name=5:7></a> My object, therefore, is to give you a brief and general statement of the whole case, referring you throughout to such of the principal publications on all sides as may enable you to form a judgment for yourself as to whether or not my statements are borne out by the facts.<a name=5:8></a> All I desire is that with the facts fairly before them, brethren should seek light and grace from God to judge of them in His presence.<a name=5:9></a> Were He thus simply sought, with nothing to desire or maintain but His glory, I doubt not He would make a plain path before His people (indeed I believe He has done so) however difficult and intricate it may appear to anything but the eye of faith.<a name=5:10></a>
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is now nearly twenty years since it pleased God to awaken many of His children to the importance, and solemnity, as well as to the exceeding blessedness of what He has revealed in His word respecting HIS CHURCH.<a name=6:1></a> Its union with Christ as one body (of which He is the glorified Head) quickened, indwelt, and governed by the Holy Ghost come down from Heaven, along with the proper hope of the Church, which is the coming of God's Son from Heaven, formed the substance of what the Christians I speak of were led to discern as the teachings of God's word on this subject.<a name=6:2></a> I speak not of God's previous dealings with the souls of many of them.<a name=6:3></a> They held of course the common faith of Christians with regard to foundation truths, and there was doubtless a great measure of personal devotedness, self-denial, and separation from the world, before they received clear light from God's word as to what the calling, glory, position, and hopes of the Church are.<a name=6:4></a> What I speak of is the effect this light from God's word had upon their souls, and how it manifested itself in their course.<a name=6:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first effect was necessarily a deep sense of the entire contrast between all that man and the world calls "the Church", and what "the Church" really is as seen in the light of God's thoughts.<a name=6:6></a> Deep humiliation and sorrow of heart, with unfeigned confession of the Church's low and sorrowful estate were the fruit of this.<a name=6:7></a> Then came the exercise of conscience as to whether they could maintain their individual connections with the great professing body in any of its several sections -- whether, in short, this was not the practical denial of what the Church is, as the one holy elect bride of Christ separated from the world to wait on Him as her only hope, and knowing now the presence of the Comforter as her only joy.<a name=6:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Many and painful and deep were the searchings of heart through which these brethren passed; issuing, however, in the secession of many individuals from
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=7>[Page 7]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the various bodies of professing Christians, and in their coming together for worship and communion on ground entirely distinct from that taken by any of the denominations around.<a name=7:1></a> It was not that they attempted to re-constitute the Church as God (not man) had constituted it at first.<a name=7:2></a> To attempt this they (at least most of them) saw would be presumption, and end in something worse than that from which they had withdrawn.<a name=7:3></a> Having got a higher standard than before by which to judge themselves and things around, I mean God's own thoughts concerning "His Church", they had been forced by the contrariety to these thoughts of everything which bore the name of "the Church" to go "outside the camp".<a name=7:4></a> Just as Moses went outside God's camp of Israel because a calf was worshipped there instead of God, so did these brethren go outside the camp of the professing Church, because of the virtual and practical denial there of the holiness, the unity, and the heavenly calling and hopes of the Church; and finding one another thus outside, they were cast upon the living God for His guidance how to act.<a name=7:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		They formed no system, they made no plan.<a name=7:6></a> Their hope was the speedy return of Jesus, and they desired to be found of Him, yea, and that as many of His saints as possible might be found of Him in such a position that they might not "be ashamed before him at his coming".<a name=7:7></a> The will of God and the end for which Christ died they saw to be "that he might gather together in one the children of God scattered abroad".<a name=7:8></a> The very instincts of the divine life too, made them desire and feel their need of the fellowship of saints.<a name=7:9></a> And it pleased God to show them that they neither needed to re-constitute the Church themselves (which was plainly impossible), nor wait till He should re-constitute it upon earth (which He has nowhere promised to do), but that at once they had the warrant of His word for meeting together for

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		worship and communion, with the assurance of the Lord's presence to bless them and guide them onward in their path.<a name=8:1></a> "Wherever two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them".<a name=8:2></a> In the faith of this they began to meet together, and they found the Lord faithful to His word.<a name=8:3></a> His presence was manifested among them, and His strength made perfect in their felt and acknowledged weakness.<a name=8:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There were two things clearly involved in the ground on which they were thus gathered together.<a name=8:5></a> The name of Christ being the centre of their union, that which they looked for in any who sought their fellowship was the saving knowledge of that name by the quickening power of the Holy Ghost.<a name=8:6></a> But then, as it was really the perception God had given them of His holiness and the holiness that became His house, which had separated them individually from the bodies with which they had been connected, so was there full provision in the blessed promise of our Lord above cited for maintaining that holiness even where but two or three are gathered together in His name.<a name=8:7></a> "<i>There am I in the midst of them</i>".<a name=8:8></a> More effectual provision for godly discipline there could not be, and solemn indeed is the sanction declared in the context as attaching to any act of discipline flowing thus from the presence of the Holy One in the midst of His twos or threes.<a name=8:9></a> "Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven".<a name=8:10></a> The following extract from the <i>Christian Witness</i> of April, 1835, pages 137 - 8, will show what were brethren's views on this subject then.<a name=8:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Thus, in the worst possible circumstances, two things are secured to the Lord's people, their strength and comfort in His presence, and their right to regard as a heathen man and a publican, any one who brings a scandal on his profession, and blasphemes that holy name by which he is called.<a name=8:12></a> The people of the Lord can always <i>act</i>; if they be His, they have

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		His Spirit, and in that Spirit can meet together, and with that Spirit they can judge and withdraw themselves from any brother, who, after remonstrance, still continues to walk disorderly.<a name=9:1></a> So that the comfort of His worshippers, and the purity of His worship, is secured, by this charter of the ever gracious and loving Lord, to His very feeble remnant.<a name=9:2></a> The simple principle is, that the Lord would never oblige His people to sin".<a name=9:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I feel this extract to be an important testimony at this moment, as many are denying that brethren ever acknowledged any power or capacity for the exercise of discipline in the position they occupy.<a name=9:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For a length of time the blessing of God evidently rested on the brethren who thus began to meet together.<a name=9:5></a> Evangelising testimony went forth, and many in different places were brought to know the Lord.<a name=9:6></a> The attention of Christians too was awakened very widely, and in both ways the number of those meeting together in the name of Jesus was greatly increased.<a name=9:7></a> Much opposition was made by leading men in the several denominations, but this seemed only to increase the attention of Christians to what God was doing, and to confirm in their position of separateness to Him and simple dependence upon Him, those who had been brought there by His grace.<a name=9:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in process of time it became very evident that many had been attracted to the position by other motives than those which swayed the brethren who originally took it.<a name=9:9></a> Attracted by the manifestation of love and union which they witnessed, or finding more joy and refreshment under the ministry which God raised up among brethren than elsewhere, they assumed a position outwardly, the grounds and nature of which they had never really understood by the teaching of God's Spirit.<a name=9:10></a> They preferred to be among Brethren, not because they had gone through the exercises of soul which originally brought brethren out of the different sects to meet simply in the name of Jesus, and in dependence upon the Spirit of God

		alone, but just as people would prefer one denomination to another, choosing that one where all were happy and united, and the ministry such as they approved, never troubling themselves about other matters.<a name=10:1></a> Besides, as at the first introduction of the Kingdom of Heaven, "when men slept the enemy sowed tares" where the good seed had been deposited, so in the case before us.<a name=10:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It now appears that almost from the very first there were elements of evil introduced by the enemy, very slowly and gradually manifesting themselves for a time, but in the end assuming a distinctness and working with an energy which left no room for doubt as to whence they came and to what they tended.<a name=10:3></a> One person, Mr.<a name=10:4></a> Newton, of Plymouth, who if not one of the earliest labourers there, was there soon after the commencement, began at a very early period to pursue a course distinct from that of the other brethren.<a name=10:5></a> This you may see traced from the beginning in "The Narrative of Facts", by J.<a name=10:6></a> N.<a name=10:7></a> Darby.<a name=10:8></a> Suffice it to say here that Mr.<a name=10:9></a> N.<a name=10:10></a>'s course was such as issued in all the other brethren who laboured there at the first leaving Plymouth to work elsewhere.<a name=10:11></a> Mr.<a name=10:12></a> Darby went abroad, Captain Hall to Hereford, Mr.<a name=10:13></a> Wigram to London, and Mr.<a name=10:14></a> N.<a name=10:15></a> was left almost alone at Plymouth.<a name=10:16></a> A beloved brother, Mr.<a name=10:17></a> Harris, who was not identified with the movement at first, became associated in labour with Mr.<a name=10:18></a> N.<a name=10:19></a> at Plymouth, and his presence there for several years was the only hope that brethren elsewhere had of any check being put to Mr.<a name=10:20></a> N.<a name=10:21></a>'s course.<a name=10:22></a> He, however, at a very early period of the present trouble withdrew from association with Mr.<a name=10:23></a> N.<a name=10:24></a> and those identified with him.<a name=10:25></a> The system introduced by Mr.<a name=10:26></a> N.<a name=10:27></a>, and most speciously disguised for a time, was directed to the undermining of all the truth by which God had acted on the souls of brethren, and thus to the setting up afresh in another form of all that had been renounced.<a name=10:28></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The coming of the Lord as any object of present hope or expectation was denied, and there was substituted for it the expectation of a train of events, many of them nowhere foretold in Scripture, and only existing in Mr.<a name=11:1></a> N.<a name=11:2></a>'s imagination.<a name=11:3></a> The real unity of the church as one body indwelt and governed by the Holy Ghost was denied; and instead of it the doctrine was asserted of a kind of independent churches -- so independent indeed, that when division took place at Plymouth, and godly experienced brethren from Exeter, London, and elsewhere went down to aid by their prayers and counsel, Mr.<a name=11:4></a> N.<a name=11:5></a> and his party peremptorily rejected their aid on the ground that they were not of Plymouth, and had no right to interfere.<a name=11:6></a> For the presence and sovereign rule of the Holy Ghost in the church was substituted the authority of teachers, and the authority claimed <i>for them</i> and <i>by them</i> was so absolute, that when Mr.<a name=11:7></a> Newton was charged with untruthfulness, and it was sought by one and another that the charge should be investigated before the whole body of believers, this was steadily refused on the ground that he could not be tried but by those who with him were the teachers and rulers there, and as <i>they</i> acquitted him there was no further appeal and no remedy.<a name=11:8></a> Besides this there was the steady systematic absorbing of all ministry in the word or even participation audibly in public worship into the hands of one or two, with the effectual exclusion by one means or another of all others.<a name=11:9></a> See as to this Mr.<a name=11:10></a> Hill's letter, entitled "Remarks", etc.<a name=11:11></a> There was also the zealous unwearied endeavour to form a party distinguished by Mr.<a name=11:12></a> Newton's views of prophecy and church order, to which the appellation, "the truth", was arrogated, and means were found to keep away from Plymouth any brethren whose views were known to be adverse to those.<a name=11:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Such were the leading features of the system which silently grew up at Plymouth, and I was quite aware

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=12>[Page 12]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		of its existence and of the concern felt by many brethren respecting it from the time that I became acquainted with the brethren between six and seven years ago.<a name=12:1></a> There were worse features to be developed than any of those, but the time did not arrive for their manifestation "till the energy of the Spirit of God was introduced into the scene in the ministry of Mr.<a name=12:2></a> Darby".<a name=12:3></a> Long had he and others watched the progress of things at Plymouth with sorrow and apprehension; still no hand was lifted to arrest the progress of the evil.<a name=12:4></a> At last Mr.<a name=12:5></a> D.<a name=12:6></a> came over from the continent, and after spending several months in Plymouth, labouring within the gathering there, and using what means he could to awaken the consciences of brethren, he was obliged, in order to keep a clear conscience himself, to withdraw from the assembly.<a name=12:7></a> He did so on the ground that God was practically displaced and man set up in His stead, and also that there was evil allowed in the assembly without any means of bringing it before the saints for judgment.<a name=12:8></a> Being called upon by many to explain the grounds upon which he had seceded, he consented, and in doing so he charged Mr.<a name=12:9></a> Newton in two distinct instances with having acted untruthfully.<a name=12:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The result of all this was, that a number of brethren from different parts went down to Plymouth, some of them zealous partisans of Mr.<a name=12:11></a> N.<a name=12:12></a>, and others with no judgment formed on the matters they went to inquire into.<a name=12:13></a> As already stated their interference was sternly refused by Mr.<a name=12:14></a> N.<a name=12:15></a> and his friends, and he would consent to no investigation of the charges against him except on the worldly principle of arbitration, he appointing four of his friends and Mr.<a name=12:16></a> Darby four of his.<a name=12:17></a> This Mr.<a name=12:18></a> D.<a name=12:19></a> felt would be taking the case out of the hands of God and His church, as well as making himself the head of a party.<a name=12:20></a> This proposal he accordingly refused, offering at the same time to meet Mr.<a name=12:21></a> N.<a name=12:22></a> before the whole assembly, or, if it was preferred,

	<div class="paragraph">
		before a number of the most grave and experienced brethren, or before certain brethren, fifteen in number, who had met together previously, and in whose presence that had occurred on which two of the charges were founded.<a name=13:1></a> To none of these would Mr.<a name=13:2></a> Newton consent.<a name=13:3></a> His fellow-rulers at Plymouth acquitted him, though one of them was distinctly implicated in one of the charges, and they were all identified with him and zealously aiding him in the course he pursued.<a name=13:4></a> To no other tribunal would he or they allow the case to be referred (the proposal to arbitration having been, of course, rejected by Mr.<a name=13:5></a> Darby) and hence a separation became unavoidable.<a name=13:6></a> Mr.<a name=13:7></a> Harris had ceased ministering among them for some time, and he eventually withdrew from communion.<a name=13:8></a> Some hundreds withdrew and began to break bread in Raleigh-street, and thus the division was completed at Plymouth.<a name=13:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		At first Mr.<a name=13:10></a> Darby's act was judged by brethren almost everywhere to be rash and premature.<a name=13:11></a> They had not been inside the scene, and so knew but little of the system that had been introduced.<a name=13:12></a> Several of those who went down to Plymouth to inquire, found things so much worse than they had any conception of, that they also separated from Mr.<a name=13:13></a> Newton and his party.<a name=13:14></a> One thing which seems to have weighed greatly with these brethren was the corruption of moral integrity, and the system of intrigue and deception which attended the evil.<a name=13:15></a> In April, 1846, a meeting of brethren from all parts was held in London for common humiliation and prayer, where the tokens of the Lord's presence were graciously vouchsafed to us, and from that time the eyes of brethren seemed to open to the evil.<a name=13:16></a> Mr.<a name=13:17></a> Newton and his friends were invited to that meeting but refused to attend.<a name=13:18></a> They printed their reasons for refusing, which were widely circulated.<a name=13:19></a>

		after, and in the autumn of that year a series of meetings was held in Rawstorne-street, London, very important in their origin, character, and results.<a name=14:1></a> They originated in a visit of Mr.<a name=14:2></a> N.<a name=14:3></a>'s to certain brethren in the neighbourhood of Rawstorne-street and breaking bread there.<a name=14:4></a> He held some Scripture readings at the house of one of them, after which he stated that his errand to town partly was to meet any brethren who were wishful of information as to the charges brought against him in the "Narrative of Facts".<a name=14:5></a> Most providentially Mr.<a name=14:6></a> Darby was at the time in London.<a name=14:7></a> He had come to town on his way to France and had got his passports, changed his money, and was ready to depart, when brethren waited on him to detain him till efforts were made to bring about an open investigation of the whole case, with accused and accuser face to face.<a name=14:8></a> The brethren to whom Mr.<a name=14:9></a> Newton had offered to give information, proposed to him this open investigation.<a name=14:10></a> It was proposed to him again and again by others, but steadily and invariably refused.<a name=14:11></a> The brethren meeting at Rawstorne-street then assembled, and after united prayer and consultation concluded that Mr.<a name=14:12></a> Newton could not be admitted to the Lord's Table there, so long as he refused to satisfy their consciences as to the grave charges alleged against him.<a name=14:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In connection with these events there were three documents issued by Mr.<a name=14:14></a> Newton and his party.<a name=14:15></a> One, a paper by Mr.<a name=14:16></a> Newton himself in answer to the charges of untruthfulness.<a name=14:17></a> Another, by his four co-rulers at Plymouth, assigning reasons for his non-attendance at Rawstorne-street to satisfy the consciences of the saints meeting there.<a name=14:18></a> Also a remonstrance addressed by the Plymouth rulers to the brethren meeting at Rawstorne-street on their exclusion of Mr.<a name=14:19></a> N.<a name=14:20></a> from the Lord's Table.<a name=14:21></a> All these were examined at large in four tracts entitled "Accounts of the proceedings at Rawstorne-street in November

		and December, 1846".<a name=15:1></a> These four tracts are very important as showing the dishonesty connected with the system of which the three papers before named were a defence.<a name=15:2></a> The proceedings at Rawstorne-street, and the publications growing out of them, cleared the souls of many; and in February, 1847, a meeting was held in the same place, attended by many brethren from the country, in which <i>nearly all those who had been at all looked up to amongst brethren</i> gave their solemn testimony as to the evil system which had grown up at Plymouth, and as to the need of absolute and entire separation from it.<a name=15:3></a> The testimonies of Messrs.<a name=15:4></a> M'Adam, Harris, Lean, Hall, Young, and others, were most solemn and decisive.<a name=15:5></a> There was scarcely a brother, whose name was well-known amongst brethren as labouring in the word and watching for souls, who did not at that time acquiesce in the sorrowful necessity for separation from this evil and demoralising system.<a name=15:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And now we come to a new era in this mournful history.<a name=15:7></a> Thus far the evil had been confined to the undermining of all the truths of which there had been a special revival, through the Lord's mercy, among brethren -- the setting up of clerical power and pretension to an alarming extent, and the effort to form a party for these purposes, by means indicating the total loss of integrity on the part of those who used them, and most corrupting in their effects on others.<a name=15:8></a> Now we are to find the foundations of the faith assailed by the introduction of false doctrines concerning the blessed Lord Himself.<a name=15:9></a> Strange things were known to have been taught previously.<a name=15:10></a> In his "Thoughts on the Apocalypse", Mr.<a name=15:11></a> N.<a name=15:12></a> had taught the astounding doctrine that in the future glory the saints will participate in the omniscience and omnipresent power of the Lord Himself.<a name=15:13></a> Other statements, equally strange, had been made on other subjects; but it was not till after the London meeting, in February, 1847, that

		there was brought to light a systematic and diligent inculcation of doctrines which undermine all that is essential to Christianity.<a name=16:1></a> These doctrines were first brought to light by Mr.<a name=16:2></a> Harris.<a name=16:3></a> He published a tract, entitled, "The Sufferings of Christ, as set forth in a Lecture on <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#6">Psalm  6</a>, considered, by J.<a name=16:4></a> L.<a name=16:5></a> Harris".<a name=16:6></a> The lecture, notes of which were thus printed and examined by Mr.<a name=16:7></a> H.<a name=16:8></a>, was by Mr.<a name=16:9></a> Newton.<a name=16:10></a> The following is Mr.<a name=16:11></a> Harris's account of the way in which he became possessed of those notes, and of what induced him to publish them, with his remarks upon them: --

	<div class="paragraph">
		"I desire explicitly to state how the manuscript came under my notice.<a name=16:12></a> About three weeks since one of our sisters in Exeter very kindly lent the notes to my wife, as being Mr.<a name=16:13></a> Newton's teaching, from which she had found much interest and profit.<a name=16:14></a> When my wife first told me what she had brought home, I did not pay much attention to it; but shortly after I felt it was not right in me to sanction in my house this system of private circulation, and I determined to return the manuscript unread.<a name=16:15></a> Accordingly I wrote a note to the sister who had lent the manuscript, thanking her for her kindness, and explaining my reason for returning it unread.<a name=16:16></a> It was late at night when I had finished writing, and I found in the meantime my wife had looked into the manuscript so as to get an outline of its contents, which she mentioned to me, especially the expression that 'the cross was only the closing incident in the life of Christ'.<a name=16:17></a> She thought she did not understand the meaning of the author, and referred to me for explanation.<a name=16:18></a> I then looked into the manuscript myself, and on perusing it felt surprised and shocked at finding such unscriptural statements and doctrine, which appeared to me to touch the integrity of the doctrine of the cross .<a name=16:19></a>.<a name=16:20></a>.<a name=16:21></a>".<a name=16:22></a>

		The doctrines of this lecture on <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#6">Psalm  6</a>by Mr.<a name=17:5></a> N.<a name=17:6></a>, it will be best to state in his own words.<a name=17:7></a> Speaking of Christ, he says, page 7, "For a person to be suffering here because he serves God, is one thing; but the relation of that person to God, and what he is immediately receiving from His hand while serving Him, is another; and it is this which the sixth Psalm, and many others, open to us.<a name=17:8></a> <i>They describe the hand of God stretched out, as rebuking in anger, and chastening in hot displeasure: and remember, this is not the scene on the cross</i>".<a name=17:9></a> He says, on the same page, that this -- the scene on the cross -- "<i>was only one incident in the life of Christ .<a name=17:10></a>.<a name=17:11></a>.<a name=17:12></a> It was only the closing incident of His long life of suffering and sorrow; so that to fix our eye simply on that would be to know little what the character of His real sufferings were</i>".<a name=17:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		After saying, "I do not refer to what were called His vicarious sufferings, but to His partaking of the circumstances of the woe and sorrow of the human family; and not only of the human family generally, but of a particular part of it, of Israel", he goes on to speak of the curse having fallen on them; and then adds, "<i>So Jesus became part of an accursed people -- a people who had earned God's wrath by transgression</i>

		<i>after transgression</i>".<a name=18:1></a> Again: "<i>So Jesus became obnoxious to the wrath of God the moment He came into the world</i>".<a name=18:2></a> Again: "Observe, this is chastening in displeasure; not that which comes now on the child of God, which is never in wrath, <i>but this rebuking in wrath, to which He was amenable, because He was part of an accursed people</i>; so the hand of God was continually stretched out against Him in various ways".<a name=18:3></a> From this dreadful condition he represents our Lord as getting partially delivered at His baptism by John.<a name=18:4></a> I say partially; for elsewhere he distinctly affirms that He only emerged from it entirely by death: "His life, through all the thirty years, was made up, more or less, of experiences of this kind; so it must have been a great relief to Him to hear the voice of John the Baptist, saying, 'Repent ye; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand'.<a name=18:5></a> Here was a door opened to Israel at once.<a name=18:6></a> They might come, and be forgiven; so He was glad to hear that word.<a name=18:7></a> He heard it with a wise and attentive ear, and came to be baptised, because He was one with Israel -- <i>was in their condition, one of wrath from God</i>: consequently, <i>when He was baptised, He took new ground</i>: but Israel would not take it", etc.<a name=18:8></a> Such were the doctrines promulgated by Mr.<a name=18:9></a> Newton.<a name=18:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The exposure of them by Mr.<a name=18:11></a> Harris excited general alarm among those who had been associated with their author; and he, finding it needful that something should be done, issued two pamphlets, in neither of which did he disclaim the lecture, or the doctrines asserted in it; but first stated it more at large, though in a less palpable and offensive form, and then defended and supported it.<a name=18:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It appears that, long before this, a paper of his containing the germ of this doctrine had been inserted in the <i>Christian Witness</i>.<a name=18:13></a> This was pleaded by Mr.<a name=18:14></a> N.<a name=18:15></a> and others in palliation of his subsequent course.<a name=18:16></a> It was said that he had avowed the doctrine openly in

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I well remember the effect produced on my mind by an extract from this paper, which was sent me, and which was as follows: --

		Supposing, of course, that the error confessed was the error contained in his recent tracts, my soul was bowed before God in thanksgiving for such evidence as this extract seemed to afford of a humbled and penitent state of soul in the writer.<a name=21:1></a> Judge of my surprise and sorrow, when I received the paper itself, to find that the above is almost the only word of confession contained in the seven pages of which the paper consists.<a name=21:2></a> And the error confessed is not that of the doctrine already described, the doctrine taught in the Notes of his Lectures and in the two subsequent pamphlets.<a name=21:3></a> No; he only withdraws these for reconsideration; and the error he confesses is one contained in his paper in the <i>Christian Witness</i>, viz.<a name=21:4></a>, the attributing our Lord's endurance of the sufferings in question to His connection with Adam as federal head.<a name=21:5></a> This is the error retracted, and except the paragraph above cited, the tract is little but extenuation and excuse.<a name=21:6></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These doctrines, or this system of teaching, may be stated as comprising:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1. That the Lord Jesus at His birth, and because born of a woman, partook of certain consequences of the fall -- <i>mortality</i> being one, -- and because of this association by nature, He became an heir of death -- born under death as a penalty.<a name=21:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=22>[Page 22]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2. That the Lord Jesus at His birth stood in such relation to Adam as a federal head; that guilt was imputed to Him; and that He was exposed to certain consequences of such imputation, as stated in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>.<a name=22:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3. That the Lord Jesus was also born as a Jew under the broken law, and was regarded by God as standing in that relation to Him; and that God pressed upon His soul the terrors of Sinai, as due to one in that relation.<a name=22:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4. That the Lord Jesus took the place of distance from God, which such a person so born and so related must take; and that He had to find His way back to God by some path in which God might at last own and meet Him.<a name=22:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		5. That so fearful was the distance, and so real were these relations by birth, and so actual were their attendant penalties of death, wrath, and the curse, that until His deliverance God is said to have rebuked Him, to have chastened Him, and that in anger and hot displeasure.<a name=22:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		6. That because of these dealings from God, and Christ's sufferings under them, the language of <a href="../bible/Lamentations.htm#3">Lamentations  3</a>, and <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#6">Psalm  6</a>, <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#38">Psalm  38</a>and <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#88">Psalm  88</a>, etc.<a name=22:5></a>, has been stated to be the utterance of the Lord Jesus while under this heavy pressure from God's hand.<a name=22:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		7. That the Lord Jesus extricated Himself from these inflictions by keeping the law; and that at John's baptism the consequent difference in Christ's feelings and experience was so great, as to have been illustrated by a comparison of the difference between Mount Sinai and Mount Sion, or between law and grace.<a name=22:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		After giving this summary of the doctrines which had been held and taught by himself and others, Mr.<a name=23:1></a> B.<a name=23:2></a> thus proceeds: "I feel, beloved brethren and sisters, whilst writing this outline of doctrine, that it ought to be enough of itself to arouse and alarm you; that it ought to give you at once a sufficient insight into this system of teaching to lead you to ask what spell could have been so firmly bound around us as to make all contented under it; to induce many not only to feed upon it themselves, but to circulate and commend it to others; and to lead some to defend and re-affirm it whenever assailed or threatened.<a name=23:3></a> This, I repeat, might be a very proper question for each to put to his own conscience before God; and I do not doubt that a ready answer would be supplied, according to our individual faith and acquaintance with God; at all events, I do not hesitate to declare that my own mind is satisfied to say -- <i>delusion</i>, and that I am as free to own my conviction as to the <i>source</i> of this delusive power, however painful and humbling to <i>me</i> to do so".<a name=23:4></a>

		"I would say, then -- 1.<a name=23:7></a> That if Christ took at birth, and by birth, certain consequences of Adam's sin, such as mortality; and that if He stood by birth in the relation to God of Israel under the broken law; and that if He took correspondingly the place of distance from God, and had the experiences of an unconverted man, there was surely need enough that He should work his way back to God, and find some point where God could meet Him.<a name=23:8></a> 2.<a name=23:9></a> That if the accompanying inflictions, rebukes, and chastisements from God, due to a person in that position, were really allowed to fall upon Christ, and were moreover pressed upon His soul according to God's power and holiness, there was surely need enough that He

		But there is another point I must advert to before Bethesda's connection with all this comes in view.<a name=26:1></a> In the month of May, 1848, a meeting was held at Bath, attended by about 100 brethren from all parts, the leading features of which were 1.<a name=26:2></a> That in it the brethren who had been rescued from the doctrinal errors of Mr.<a name=26:3></a> N.<a name=26:4></a>, and whose confessions have been noticed, made further confession, full and ample, as to their implication in the charges made against the untruthful, immoral system of Ebrington-street, as brought to light in the "Narrative of Facts", and "Account of Proceedings in Rawstorne-street".<a name=26:5></a> <i>They acknowledged that these charges were just</i>.<a name=26:6></a> One, at least, of those who signed their names to "the Plymouth documents", referred to on page 8, confessed that these documents were justly chargeable with trickery and falsehood <a href="#26:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>.<a name=26:7></a> It is not as delighting in evil, or feeling any pleasure in publishing my brethren's sins, the Lord knoweth, that I mention this.<a name=26:8></a> I am only astonished at the grace bestowed on them thus humbly to acknowledge wherein they had fallen; but I mention it because it is of all importance to remember that the false doctrine is not the only thing in question.<a name=26:9></a> There was a separation, and solemn necessity for it, before the evil doctrine came to light.<a name=26:10></a> And what was made clear to the simplest by the confessions of beloved brethren at the Bath meeting was this, not only that the doctrines must be repudiated, but the system of trickery and deceit guarded against, which preceded the open avowal of the doctrines.<a name=26:11></a> Both system and doctrines, however, blessed be God, were distinctly confessed, and as distinctly renounced, by beloved brethren who had been most deeply entangled in both.<a name=26:12></a> Let this triumph of the restoring grace of our God and Father be our

		2. The other remarkable feature of the Bath meeting was this, that the "Narrative of Facts", and other publications of Mr.<a name=27:2></a> Darby on these mournful occurrences, were subjected at that meeting to the strictest scrutiny; Lord Congleton endeavouring for five hours to prove them false, and Mr.<a name=27:3></a> Nelson, of Edinburgh, aiding him in his efforts.<a name=27:4></a> The result was, that the statements contained in these pamphlets were so fully established that some, who had always mistrusted them till then, exclaimed that they never knew anything so demonstrated.<a name=27:5></a> Mr.<a name=27:6></a> Robert Howard, of Tottenham, and Mr.<a name=27:7></a> Jukes, of Hull, who were present at the meeting, both assured me that nothing could exceed the triumphant manner in which these publications were vindicated from every attempt to call their statements in question; every endeavour to shake their testimony recoiling on the heads of those who made them.<a name=27:8></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1. The object of the paper is to vindicate the conduct of those who signed it in taking a <i>neutral</i> position with regard to the solemn questions which have now been hastily reviewed.<a name=28:7></a> They say, "We were well aware that the great body of believers amongst us were in happy ignorance of the Plymouth controversy, and we did not feel it well to be considered as identifying ourselves with either party".<a name=28:8></a>

		2. They do, nevertheless, at the beginning of the paper, disclaim the doctrines taught by Mr.<a name=28:9></a> N.<a name=28:10></a> They do not mention his name; but say, "We add, for the further satisfaction of any who may have had their minds disturbed, that we utterly disclaim the assertion that the blessed Son of God was involved in the guilt of the first Adam; or that He was born under the curse of the broken law, because of His connection with Israel.<a name=28:11></a> We hold Him to have been always the Holy One of God, in whom the Father was ever well pleased".<a name=28:12></a>

		3. The reasons assigned in this paper of the ten for not judging the error in question are most unsatisfactory, some of them being, in fact, the strongest possible reasons for their investigating it thoroughly.<a name=29:11></a> Hear their words: "The practical reason alleged why we should enter upon the investigation of certain tracts issued from Plymouth was, that thus we might be able to know how to act with reference to those who might visit us from thence (rather, who had already come), or who are supposed to be adherents of the author of the said publications.<a name=29:12></a> In reply to this, we have to state, that the views of the writer alluded to, could only be <i>fairly learned</i> from the examination of his own acknowledged writings .<a name=29:13></a>.<a name=29:14></a>.<a name=29:15></a> Now there has been such variableness in the views held by the writer in question, that it is difficult to ascertain what he would now acknowledge as his".<a name=29:16></a> So, because the author of a heresy is inconsistent with himself, and knows how to puzzle and confuse his readers by apparently contradictory statements, the poor of the flock are to have his disciples let in among them, to scatter the poison of his sentiments, and the pastors plead as their vindication that very tortuousness of error which makes it doubly dangerous, and the necessity for a barrier against it doubly imperative!<a name=29:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4. There is a most dangerous principle asserted in this document.<a name=29:18></a> "Even supposing that those who

	<div class="paragraph">
		inquired into the matter had come to the same conclusion, touching the amount of positive error therein contained, this would not have guided us in our decision respecting individuals coming from Plymouth.<a name=30:1></a> For, supposing the author of the tracts were fundamentally heretical, this would not warrant us in rejecting those who came from under his teaching, until we were satisfied that they had understood and imbibed views essentially subversive of foundation truth; especially as those meeting at Ebrington-street, Plymouth, last January, put forth a statement disclaiming the errors charged against the tracts".<a name=30:2></a> That is, a man may for years teach doctrines admitted to be fundamentally heretical (say Socinian); the congregation which allows him thus to teach (say Socinianism), puts forth a statement disclaiming the doctrines which are still, nevertheless, known to be taught amongst them, and thus accredited by them; members of the congregation apply for communion elsewhere, and unless they can be individually convicted of having "understood and imbibed" Socinian doctrines, this Bethesda principle would require their reception.<a name=30:3></a> They are members of a congregation which allows amongst them a Socinian preacher, and boasts of him as deeply taught in the Word, etc.<a name=30:4></a>; but unless we can prove that they themselves have intelligently embraced Socinian errors, we have no warrant, Bethesda says, for rejecting them.<a name=30:5></a> Do saints need more than this to open their eyes as to the ground Bethesda has taken?<a name=30:6></a> And this is no "fable", no "exaggeration!<a name=30:7></a>" it is Bethesda's recorded judgment of what the fellowship of God's house is.<a name=30:8></a> The words above cited, to which "the ten" subscribed their names, and which were adopted by the vote of the congregation, tell a louder and more solemn tale in the ear of conscience than anything which has been advanced by those whom Bethesda looks upon as her adversaries.<a name=30:9></a>

		5. The manner in which the congregation at Bethesda were ensnared into the adoption of this paper of "the ten" is what no one could approve whose judgment was not previously warped.<a name=31:1></a> "Mr.<a name=31:2></a> Craik stated", at the meeting held July 3rd, 1848, "what would be the <i>order</i> of the meeting, viz.<a name=31:3></a>, the perusal, first, of Mr.<a name=31:4></a> Alexander's letter, then of their reply.<a name=31:5></a> After which the church would give judgment upon it.<a name=31:6></a> But that they (the ten, I suppose) stated deliberately and advisedly, that they were firmly resolved not to allow any extracts to be read, or any comments made on the tracts, until the meeting had first come to a decision upon their paper" <a href="#31:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>.<a name=31:7></a> Think of this: ten persons come forward with a paper committing the church, if they adopt it, to a neutral course between the author of those tracts and his friends on the one hand, and those who reject them entirely as unsound and heretical on the other.<a name=31:8></a> If this paper be adopted Bethesda becomes neutral between Mr.<a name=31:9></a> Newton and those who have disowned him; and yet, till this paper is adopted the authors of it will not allow any extracts to be read from Mr.<a name=31:10></a> N.<a name=31:11></a>'s writings, or remarks to be made on Mr.<a name=31:12></a> N.<a name=31:13></a>'s doctrines.<a name=31:14></a> And, when some objected to the congregation thus giving a decision in the dark, Mr.<a name=31:15></a> Muller said, "The first thing the Church had to do was to clear the signers of the paper; and that, if this was not done, they could not continue to labour among them; that the worse the errors were, the more reason they should not be brought out", etc.<a name=31:16></a> Thus were Bethesda people required, under pain of losing the labours of their beloved and honoured pastors, to assume a position of neutrality with regard to doctrines on which there was not a word to be spoken till they had assumed the position And the majority acquiesced in this: by standing up they declared their approbation of this paper of "the ten", and assumed the position which

		they were required to take.<a name=32:1></a> But while, on the one hand, the course taken in this matter by the rulers was most sad, let no individual in the congregation think to shift on to their shoulders the responsibility of the body in adopting their paper.<a name=32:2></a> Be it that they did it in the dark; be it that they were not allowed to have a ray of light shed on the subject, they did still rise up in approbation of the paper, and they had been informed previously by Mr.<a name=32:3></a> A.<a name=32:4></a> that the errors in question were errors affecting the person and work of our blessed Lord.<a name=32:5></a> Solemn was the responsibility assumed by the congregation in their vote of that evening; tenfold more solemn the responsibility of those who influenced them to come to it.<a name=32:6></a>

		It was soon after Bethesda had thus assumed a professedly neutral position by the reception of Mr.<a name=32:7></a> Newton's agents, and the adoption of this paper, explanatory of the ground on which they were received, that Mr.<a name=32:8></a> Darby presented the whole case to brethren in a circular, which has been reprinted lately in W.<a name=32:9></a> H.<a name=32:10></a> Dorman's "Review of certain Questions and Evils", etc.<a name=32:11></a> Soon after the circular was issued Mr.<a name=32:12></a> Darby went abroad.<a name=32:13></a> All the notice that was taken of it was in a hostile letter from Mr.<a name=32:14></a> Wakefield of Kendal, of the spirit of which I will not trust myself to speak, and all the arguments of which you have seen in Mr.<a name=32:15></a> Jukes's letter to the Leeds and Otley gatherings.<a name=32:16></a> It was by local circumstances that our brother Willans and myself were led, reluctantly enough on our part, to take any share in these proceedings.<a name=32:17></a> You must understand that by means of Mr.<a name=32:18></a> Muller's Orphan houses, Bethesda has links of connection with almost every gathering throughout the country.<a name=32:19></a> With one in Yorkshire we knew that there was a link of great: strength.<a name=32:20></a> Two other gatherings in Yorkshire we knew to have very strong and tender ties to a brother who had been greatly blessed to them in former days,

		A brother had removed from Otley to Bethesda, and by returning, or even coming on a visit, might at any time have forced the question on saints here.<a name=33:3></a> Efforts had been made, moreover, by some to prejudice the minds of saints here and at Leeds by altogether inaccurate representations of Bethesda's position, and of Mr.<a name=33:4></a> Darby's conduct towards it; and what weighed with us more than all the rest, Mr.<a name=33:5></a> Jukes, of Hull, came down from Bath, where he had been in intercourse with the friends of Bethesda's neutral position, resolved to take part with it himself, and this he could not of course do without either the silent acquiescence of brethren everywhere in these parts, or, on the other hand, the consideration by brethren of the whole case.<a name=33:6></a> We had anxiously looked for some persons of note amongst brethren to summon a general meeting to take Bethesda's case and Mr.<a name=33:7></a> Darby's circular into consideration.<a name=33:8></a> A step of this magnitude it was clearly out of the question for us to take.<a name=33:9></a> The question for our consciences was whether to stand by and see the Yorkshire gatherings quietly drawn into a neutral position between the Newtonian heresy and the receivers of it on the one side, and those who had faithfully protested against it and separated from it on the other -- these gatherings all the while, save a few brethren in Leeds and Otley, being profoundly ignorant of what the questions were on which they were to be thus neutral.<a name=33:10></a> This we could not with a clear conscience allow.<a name=33:11></a> We looked to the Lord, and had, I believe, His guidance in sending out the circular which you have seen.<a name=33:12></a> It makes known what the evil is, how by Bethesda's reception of it all the gatherings

		It has been alleged, however, that Bethesda has cleared itself of all charges of fellowship with Mr.<a name=34:7></a> Newton's false doctrines, or the holders of them; and it may be well first to state what has been done at Bethesda, and then to examine whether by all this it is really cleared, so as to be again entitled to the confidence of saints.<a name=34:8></a>

		A meeting was held in Bethesda, October 31st, 1848, in which Mr.<a name=34:9></a> Muller gave his own individual judgment of Mr.<a name=34:10></a> Newton's tracts, stating that they contained a system of insidious error, not here and there, but throughout; and that if the doctrines taught in them were followed out to their legitimate consequences, they would destroy the foundations of the gospel, and overthrow the Christian faith.<a name=34:11></a> The legitimate consequences of these doctrines he stated to be "to make the Lord need a Saviour as well as others".<a name=34:12></a> Still, while recording so strong an individual judgment as this, Mr.<a name=34:13></a> Muller said that he could not

		1.

		2. The conclusion come to was, "That no one defending, maintaining or upholding Mr.<a name=38:4></a> Newton's views or tracts, should be received into communion".<a name=38:5></a> Now this to a person who knew nothing of the controversy, and nothing of the tracts, would sound very fair and straightforward, and it is intensely painful to have at every step to call in question whether documents and declarations do really mean what at first glance a stranger would suppose they mean.<a name=38:6></a> But what are the facts of the case before us?<a name=38:7></a> First, there is no judgment given as to those who had already been received, received too at the solemn cost of the division which immediately ensued at Bristol, as well as all the rest which have followed elsewhere.<a name=38:8></a> It is a judgment as to who "<i>should</i> be received into communion", not as to what should be done <i>with those who had already been received</i>.<a name=38:9></a> Secondly, the conclusion arrived at still leaves the door quite open to those who are in avowed fellowship with Mr.<a name=38:10></a> Newton, provided they do not "defend, maintain, or uphold his views or tracts".<a name=38:11></a> There is nothing here that goes beyond the principle laid down in the paper of "the ten".<a name=38:12></a> "For, supposing the author of the tracts were fundamentally heretical, this would not warrant us in rejecting those who came from under his teaching, until we were satisfied that <i>they</i> had <i>understood</i> and <i>imbibed</i> views essentially subversive of foundation-truth".<a name=38:13></a> If a person comes from Compton-street, and has frankness to say, I <i>understand</i> and <i>hold</i>, and am resolved to <i>propagate</i> as I can, Mr.<a name=38:14></a> Newton's views on the points now in question, he would not be received by Bethesda.<a name=38:15></a> But a dozen persons might come at once from Compton-street and be admitted

		3. The result of this judgment of Bethesda is said to be that "By the 12th of February, 1849, all Mr.<a name=39:13></a> Newton's friends at Bethesda had sent in their resignations -- Captain Woodfall, Mr.<a name=39:14></a> Woodfall, Mrs.<a name=39:15></a> Brown, Mr.<a name=39:16></a> and Mrs.<a name=39:17></a> Aitchison, two Miss Farmers, and two Miss Percivals".<a name=39:18></a> And this is clearly put forth in Bethesda's defence by one of Bethesda's chief leaders!<a name=39:19></a> From the time that these questions arose, the uniform and oft reiterated defence put forth by Bethesda and her advocates was <i>that there were none in Bethesda</i> who held Mr.<a name=39:20></a> Newton's views, or promoted his designs.<a name=39:21></a> Now we are assured by Lord C.<a name=39:22></a> in a tract put forth by Mr.<a name=39:23></a> Groves, that all Mr.<a name=39:24></a> Newton's friends at Bethesda have sent in resignations!<a name=39:25></a> A list of their names is given us, consisting of the very persons who had been received by Bethesda in spite of every warning and remonstrance from within and from without; including also one name which was appended to the paper

	<div class="paragraph">
		The worst, however, remains to be told.<a name=40:13></a> So far from the six weeks' meetings, and the conclusion arrived at, and the result of both, having cleared Bethesda of the evil, or made it more worthy of the confidence of brethren, its actual present position is such as to be less entitled to confidence than before.<a name=40:14></a> We are not left to learn the value and grounds of the resignations of Mr.<a name=40:15></a> Newton's friends from Lord C.<a name=40:16></a>'s statement, as two of them, Captain and Mr.<a name=40:17></a> Woodfall, have circulated a paper in which the grounds of their resignation are plainly stated.<a name=40:18></a> Two sentences from that paper are enough to make manifest the character of the whole proceeding.<a name=40:19></a> "This step of ours", they say, "has been finally determined on from a conversation with one of your pastors, who seems to think this would relieve <i>them</i> from some of their difficulties".<a name=40:20></a>

		Only think of an amicable arrangement between one of the pastors of Bethesda and two of Mr.<a name=41:2></a> Newton's friends who are in communion there, the issue of which is the withdrawal of the latter, <i>to relieve the former from some of their difficulties</i>, these voluntary seceders maintaining meanwhile their right to communion whenever they may think proper to return!<a name=41:3></a> And this is set forth as a proof that Bethesda has cleared herself of the evil, and as enough to satisfy the consciences of brethren that there is nothing now requiring separation from Bethesda.<a name=41:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The fact is, if I am correctly informed, and the truthfulness and accuracy of my informant I have every reason to trust, that there is an open communication between those "friends of Mr.<a name=41:5></a> Newton" who have withdrawn from Bethesda, and others remaining in Bethesda still.<a name=41:6></a> Bethesda has not professed to shut the door against those who are in avowed fellowship with Mr.<a name=41:7></a> N.<a name=41:8></a> and his adherents, unless they uphold, defend, or maintain his doctrines or his tracts.<a name=41:9></a> Sympathisers with him there are unquestionably in Bethesda still.<a name=41:10></a> They have the work to do inside; while those who have withdrawn can do work of another kind outside more effectually than they could have done it within.<a name=41:11></a> I say not that Messrs.<a name=41:12></a> Groves and Muller intended it should be so; far from it; but when expediency becomes our guide, and to maintain our own consistency our object, we become the dupes and tools of an unseen agent, who seeks to accomplish his own purposes by means of us and our ways.<a name=41:13></a> I state it subject to correction; and the moment there is a fair and open meeting, where everything can be gone into, I am willing to give up my author, and have the following statement, with every other I have made, thoroughly sifted and weighed.<a name=41:14></a> I have been

	<div class="paragraph">
		Were I asked my reasons as an individual, for being entirely separate from Compton-street congregation, Plymouth, my answer would be twofold:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1. The sectarian, clerical, and demoralising system there set up, as unfolded in the "Narrative of Facts" and account of proceedings in Rawstorne-street.<a name=42:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2. The awful doctrines since promulgated by Mr.<a name=42:8></a> Newton on the subject of the sufferings of our blessed Lord.<a name=42:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Were I asked the same question with regard to Bethesda, my answer would be:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1. The declared assumption of a neutral position towards the evil system and evil doctrines of Mr.<a name=42:10></a> Newton.<a name=42:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2. The latitudinarian principle laid down in the paper of "the ten", and adopted by the body, that those who are in avowed fellowship with heretics cannot be refused admission to the Lord's table, unless they themselves have understood and imbibed heretical sentiments.<a name=42:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=43>[Page 43]</a>
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		4. That the neutral position has not really been abandoned; that sympathisers with the heresy are yet allowed to be within, and no barrier presented to their free communication with avowed adherents of the heresy without.<a name=43:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"Dear Brethren, -- Our brother, Mr.<a name=51:1></a> George Alexander, having printed and circulated a statement expressive of his reasons for withdrawing from visible fellowship with us at the table of the Lord; and these reasons being grounded on the fact that those who labour among you have not complied with his request relative to the judging of certain errors which have been taught at Plymouth; it becomes needful that those of us who have incurred any responsibility in this matter should lay before you a brief explanation of the way in which we have acted".<a name=51:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"And first, it may be well to mention, that we had no intimation whatever of our brother's intention to act as he has done, nor any knowledge of his intention to circulate any letter, until it was put into our hands in print".<a name=51:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"Some weeks ago, he expressed his determination to bring his views before a meeting of the body, and he was told that he was quite at liberty to do so.<a name=51:4></a> He afterwards declared that he would waive this, but never intimated, in the slightest way, his intention to act as he has done, without first affording the church an opportunity of hearing his reasons for separation.<a name=51:5></a> Under these circumstances, we feel, it of the deepest importance, for relieving the disquietude of mind naturally occasioned by our brother's letter, explicitly to state that the views relative to the Person of our blessed Lord, held by those who for sixteen years have been occupied in teaching the word among you, <i>are unchanged</i>".<a name=51:6></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"We add, for the further satisfaction of any who may have had their minds disturbed, that we utterly disclaim the assertion that the blessed Son of God was involved in the guilt of the first Adam; or that He was born under the curse of the broken law, because of His connection with Israel.<a name=52:3></a> We hold Him to have been always the Holy One of God, in whom the Father was ever well pleased.<a name=52:4></a> We know of no curse which the Saviour bore, except that which He endured as the surety for sinners -- according to that scripture, 'He was made a curse for us'.<a name=52:5></a> We utterly reject the thought of His ever having had the experiences of an unconverted person; but maintain that while He suffered <i>outwardly</i> the trials connected with His being a man and an Israelite -- still in His feelings and experiences, as well as in His external character, He was entirely 'separate from sinners'".<a name=52:6></a>

		Now, to pass from the days of the apostles to our own, we find that, in the revival of the truth over a century ago, what was prominent in the minds of the spiritual was the truth of the assembly.<a name=78:9></a> We have been told that the light broke into the soul of Mr.<a name=78:10></a> J.<a name=78:11></a> N.<a name=78:12></a> Darby that there was a Head in heaven.<a name=78:13></a> Then, said he to himself, there must be a body on earth.<a name=78:14></a> If we read his early writings, such as "The Nature and Unity of the Church of Christ", written in 1828, we find that it is the assembly which is before him, and its moral and spiritual features.<a name=78:15></a> The coming together of saints was to be in the light of those features which pertain to the assembly universally.<a name=78:16></a> The revival was definitely on the line of Paul's glad

		<a name=79>[Page 79]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		tidings, and of Paul's ministry of the assembly.<a name=79:1></a> The brethren who were spiritually instructed had no such thought as that it was the divine intent that the assembly in its universal aspect should be, or should become, invisible.<a name=79:2></a> On the contrary, they felt deeply the fact that it had become so; that "the true church of God had no avowed communion at all" was a grievous evil to be mourned over and confessed.<a name=79:3></a> They felt that the body is here as a substantive reality to be edified, and to increase with the increase of God.<a name=79:4></a> Christ is sanctifying and purifying the assembly, and nourishing and cherishing it.<a name=79:5></a> This is not in heaven, but down here on earth.<a name=79:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But alongside this revival of Paul's doctrine there was developing amongst the brethren an entirely different system of teaching.<a name=79:7></a> There were those who held that the assembly in its universal aspect had become invisible, and that nothing now remained but to set up local assemblies, each being a self-contained body, having no responsibility with reference to other such bodies, and free to receive any individual believer supposed to be personally sound in the faith and consistent in life, without taking any account of the associations in which he may have been previously.<a name=79:8></a> The truth of <i>the</i> assembly in its general unity, calling for recognition in a practical way by those who have the light of it, thus entirely lost its due place.<a name=79:9></a> According to this system of teaching, each separate meeting is an independent "assembly", even if there are several in one town.<a name=79:10></a> Scripture never speaks of different assemblies in one city.<a name=79:11></a> At Jerusalem, where there were thousands of believers, and where they no doubt met in many different places, it is always "the assembly" -- in the singular.<a name=79:12></a> The idea of independent churches, without any recognition of a universal bond of <i>responsible</i> partnership, is quite foreign to Scripture.<a name=79:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There were thus two different conceptions in the minds of brethren.<a name=79:14></a> One was governed by the thought

		<a name=80>[Page 80]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		of the unity of the whole assembly as one body, one house, one temple, and by the thought of all the saints everywhere being called to one universal fellowship.<a name=80:1></a> The other was based on the idea of each meeting being an independent "assembly".<a name=80:2></a> The moment was bound to come when these two different principles would be found to be entirely out of keeping with each other.<a name=80:3></a> It was not long before circumstances arose which brought this to light.<a name=80:4></a> But it is important to recognise that what happened at Plymouth did not bring about the difference of principles.<a name=80:5></a> It only served to expose what was there before.<a name=80:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mr.<a name=80:7></a> Darby and others separated from the original meeting at Plymouth in 1845 because clericalism was set up there, which they rightly judged was not of God.<a name=80:8></a> But the Lord in His wisdom did not allow this particular matter to become the general test.<a name=80:9></a> In 1847 it was discovered that Mr.<a name=80:10></a> Newton held and taught most serious error as to the Lord's personal relationships.<a name=80:11></a> This false teaching definitely raised the question as to whether <i>fellowship</i> involved a <i>responsible</i> partnership or not.<a name=80:12></a> The extreme gravity of false teaching as to the Lord's relationships ought to have helped the brethren to be very sensitive in their affections, as well as in conscience and intelligence.<a name=80:13></a> They ought all to have weighed well that fellowship (or partnership) with such error was most serious in the sight of God.<a name=80:14></a> The ground was taken eventually at Bethesda that the error was condemned, but that fellowship with it by breaking bread with those who held it was no bar to communion, and that no individual believer was to be held responsible for what he might be walking in partnership with, unless he actually avowed the error himself.<a name=80:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus where this principle is adhered to, no assembly bond of partnership which involves saints in common <i>responsibility</i> is admitted.<a name=80:16></a> Each is regarded as an individual who is not to be held responsible for any

		associations he may have been in, but only for his personal views and conduct.<a name=81:1></a> There is no thought of <i>fellowship</i> in this, for fellowship means a common equal sharing, or joint participation, and this, when it is a question of breaking bread, in a most solemn way as before God.<a name=81:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The fact that defilement is contracted by touching what is unclean is clearly laid down in the Old Testament, and the New Testament expressly says, "touch not what is unclean", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#6:17">2 Corinthians  6:17</a>.<a name=81:3></a> It is also clear in Scripture that a much less thing than breaking bread with a person may involve one in responsibility for what he does, for John says that the one who gives a friendly greeting to a man who does not bring the doctrine of Christ "partakes [the verbal form of the word fellowship] in his wicked works", <a href="../bible/2John.htm#11">2 John  11</a>.<a name=81:4></a> One is viewed as in fellowship with his wicked works if simply greeting him.<a name=81:5></a> This shows what a very small thing, as men would say, involves responsibility as before God for one's associations.<a name=81:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If to break bread with an evil-doer does not, in the minds of believers, involve any complicity in his evil, neither does breaking bread with faithful saints involve the recognition that we are in the most intimate partnership with them.<a name=81:7></a> The sense of the divine bond is lost; persons break bread as so many individuals without any sense of responsible partnership.<a name=81:8></a> So that, according to these principles, the local assembly takes independent ground in declining to be bound by any assembly action other than its own, and the individual is held free of any responsibility, even in his own assembly, for anything that may have taken place there, save his own views and his own conduct.<a name=81:9></a> This principle annuls responsibility in regard of associations, which Scripture so carefully maintains; it entirely sets aside the true thought of fellowship.<a name=81:10></a><br>C.<a name=81:11></a>A.<a name=81:12></a>C.<a name=81:13></a>

		MR. DARBY'S TEACHING AS TO THE SUFFERINGS OF CHRIST
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Attention having been called to the subject of the sufferings of Christ by the erroneous teaching of Mr.<a name=82:1></a> Newton, Mr.<a name=82:2></a> Darby issued a paper in 1858 in which he pointed out that the sufferings of Christ fell into three categories:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1. Atoning sufferings which came upon Him from God, when He offered Himself without spot to God to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself, and was forsaken by God.<a name=82:3></a> In these, of course, He was entirely alone.<a name=82:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2. Sufferings which He endured at the hands of men for righteousness' sake, in which character of sufferings the saints may have part.<a name=82:5></a> (See <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#5:10">Matthew  5:10</a>; <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#4:14">1 Peter  4:14</a> - 16, 19).<a name=82:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		3. A wide field of suffering, not covered by the first two categories, which included (a) the suffering in spirit necessarily felt by the Holy One of God in passing through a world of evil (see, for example, <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#7:34">Mark  7:34</a>; <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#8:12">Mark  8:12</a>; <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#9:19">Mark  9:19</a>), (b) the deep anguish occasioned by the <i>anticipation</i> of, and the holy shrinking from, being made sin, and in that position sustaining God's unmitigated judgment of it (see <a href="../bible/John.htm#12:27">John  12:27</a>; <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#26:36">Matthew  26:36</a> - 44; <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#14:32">Mark  14:32</a> - 40; <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22:39">Luke  22:39</a> - 46; <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#5:7">Hebrews  5:7</a>, 8), and (c) the suffering in spirit resulting from His voluntarily entering, in the sympathy of love, into the deep exercises of soul which the godly remnant of Israel will yet pass through as they realise, in the days of the great tribulation, God's governmental dealings with them in respect of their rejection of the Messiah.<a name=82:7></a> This character of suffering, as well as that referred to under (b), entered into the sorrows of Gethsemane.<a name=82:8></a> The feelings of the heart of Christ, caused by these

		I believe, on the contrary, that -- though suffering from man and feeling for all the sufferings of man, and Israel, and the sorrow of love resting continually upon His heart -- the sunshine of God's favour was on Him and was His delight and His joy continually, and thus there was no divine displeasure resting on that Holy One, nor was His frame wasted by the anguish of it.<a name=84:1></a> I detest it as a false abomination.<a name=84:2></a> But I believe that in grace, at the close of His history, when His life-work, as presented to Israel according to promise and gracious service towards man, was brought to a close, He, the object of divine favour, entered into the sorrows of His people.<a name=84:3></a>

		MR. CLUFF AND HIS VIEWS AS TO "DEAD TO NATURE"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		About the years 1878 and 1879 considerable confusion was caused for a time in the minds of many by the teaching of a Mr.<a name=85:1></a> Cluff as to the believer being "dead to nature".<a name=85:2></a> This teaching, while having a superficial appearance of spirituality, was in fact destructive of it, and tended in its results either to unreality or to legality.<a name=85:3></a> The following letters by Mr.<a name=85:4></a> Darby, written at the time, will indicate what were the issues as to the truth involved in this teaching: --

		My Dear Brother, -- Exaggerations are always dangerous and, where imagination is at work, deceive to people's cost; but the subject is a serious one.<a name=85:6></a> "Dead to nature" is not a scriptural expression; so we must see what people mean and what Scripture says.<a name=85:7></a> But deadness to the world and all the flesh is after, is what is wanting among Christians.<a name=85:8></a>

		But none of these is the highest measure taken in Scripture.<a name=87:6></a> These think of sin, though of death to it, but never of our living in it.<a name=87:7></a> Colossians goes a step further, and on to ground which is fully developed in Ephesians.<a name=87:8></a> When man's highest condition in this respect is spoken of, he has not died to anything: he is viewed as <i>dead in</i> trespasses and sins, and then as a new creation -- a creation after God.<a name=87:9></a> It is just mentioned; <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:13">Colossians  2:13</a>.<a name=87:10></a> This is fully developed in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2">Ephesians  2</a>and here note, Christ is not viewed as life-giving, but as raised when a dead man, He having descended in grace to where we were, and in an effectual work for us, so that we rise with Him and into the same place.<a name=87:11></a> This is referred to in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:14">2 Corinthians  5:14</a>, 17, and in the remarkable summary in <a href="../bible/John.htm#5:24">John  5:24</a>.<a name=87:12></a> All this stands on a different ground from being quickened and having died: we have changed our place and position, are created anew.<a name=87:13></a> But if dying is to be brought in and dwelt on, people are really in general under law, and do not count themselves dead; and if they talk of dying to nature, which Scripture does not, they will soon find to their cost that nature is not dead.<a name=87:14></a>

		RYDE AND DR. CRONIN; RAMSGATE AND MR. WM. KELLY
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These matters, which occurred in the years 1879 to 1881, and eventually resulted in the separation often referred to as the "Kelly trouble", were really but the fruit and evidence of a low moral state among the brethren generally, which caused enfeeblement of moral and spiritual perception, and an absence of unity, resulting in a general powerlessness to deal with evil.<a name=100:1></a> The general state shewed itself in an independence of outlook and judgment on the part of certain well-known brothers, with a readiness to override the consciences of their brethren in attempts to enforce recognition of their own judgment.<a name=100:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The material facts of this sorrowful history are as follows: There was in 1879 a company meeting at the Temperance Hall, Ryde, Isle of Wight, which was recognised as in fellowship, though admittedly in a low state.<a name=100:3></a> A letter of commendation from this company having been sent to the brethren at Kingston-on-Thames, and having been read to them in the usual way, this action was challenged by Mr.<a name=100:4></a> W.<a name=100:5></a> Kelly and others on the ground that the state at Ryde was such that the meeting should not be regarded as in fellowship, and that therefore a person commended from there should not be received.<a name=100:6></a> This attitude was resisted by Mr.<a name=100:7></a> Darby and others, on the ground that the Ryde meeting had never been disowned by brethren, and therefore a person from that meeting could not be refused on the private judgment of individual brothers.<a name=100:8></a> In the course of the difficulties existing at Ryde, an independent company had been formed in that town by some who previously broke bread at the Temperance Hall, but this independent company was not recognised by brethren generally in the neighbourhood, who continued to extend fellowship to those breaking bread at the Temperance Hall.<a name=100:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In this state of affairs, Dr.<a name=101:1></a> Cronin, who belonged to one of the London meetings (Kennington), went down to Ryde and broke bread with the independent company, seeking by this means to enforce recognition of it.<a name=101:2></a> The brethren in London were unduly slow in repudiating Dr.<a name=101:3></a> Cronin's action, though there was much concern about it among the saints wherever it became known, and in August, 1879, certain of the brethren who broke bread together at Guildford Hall, Ramsgate, felt that in order to maintain a good conscience before God, they could no longer continue in fellowship with those who supported Dr.<a name=101:4></a> Cronin, whether at Ramsgate, Kennington, or elsewhere.<a name=101:5></a> They therefore, after having broken bread with the rest of their brethren on August 17th, but a common judgment not having been arrived at in a meeting specially called on August 22nd to determine Ramsgate's relations with London, separated themselves and broke bread together on August 24th at Almorah House, Ramsgate.<a name=101:6></a> Those they had left did not break bread on that day, the meeting at Ramsgate being thus broken up.<a name=101:7></a> Had those who commenced to break bread at Almorah House not acted in this precipitate way, much sorrow might have been avoided, for on the very next day news reached Ramsgate that the London brethren had considered Dr.<a name=101:8></a> Cronin's matter and were proposing his exclusion from fellowship, by which action their consciences would be met.<a name=101:9></a> On hearing of the action proposed to be taken by London, those at Ramsgate who had <i>not</i> broken bread at Almorah House, nor indeed at all on August 24th, took another hall at Abbotts Hill, Ramsgate, and assuming assembly status, decided to accept the action proposed to be taken by London, and, without seeking their brethren who had broken bread at Almorah House, closed the door upon them as having withdrawn from fellowship.<a name=101:10></a> As soon as London's proposed action became known to those

		who had withdrawn to Almorah House, they ceased breaking bread, and acknowledging that they had been precipitate in the step they had taken, sought to rejoin their brethren.<a name=102:1></a> This was refused, those at Abbotts Hill claiming to be regarded as the acknowledged company in Ramsgate, and that their brethren at Almorah House had been guilty of schism and as such were excluded from fellowship.<a name=102:2></a> In taking this ground those at Abbotts Hill ignored the just claim of their brethren at Almorah House that, however much they might have failed in detail, their action had been dictated by a desire to maintain what was due to the Lord's name.<a name=102:3></a> On November 21st the brethren at Abbotts Hill withdrew their exclusion from fellowship of their brethren who had separated from them, and who by then were again meeting in the old room -- Guildford Hall -- but declared at the same time that their exclusion of them had been righteous.<a name=102:4></a> On December 18th the Guildford Hall brethren who, as stated before, had ceased to break bread, proposed to those at Abbotts Hill that in view of their common failure, the latter should cease to break bread for one Lord's day and that they should then all meet together for confession and prayer.<a name=102:5></a> This was refused by the Abbotts Hill company, who took the ground of having continued all along to be the recognised company at Ramsgate, despite the break-up that had occurred on August 24th.<a name=102:6></a>

		All efforts by godly brethren elsewhere, including Mr.<a name=102:7></a> Darby, to bring in healing proving unavailing because of the attitude maintained by those at Abbotts Hill, those meeting at Guildford Hall recommenced breaking bread in March 1881, and appealed for the fellowship of brethren generally in doing so.<a name=102:8></a> In the following month a letter of commendation from Guildford Hall, Ramsgate, to brethren in London compelled a decision to be come to as to which of the two companies in Ramsgate was to be regarded as in

		You know that the natural tendency, as numbers increase in the assemblies, is that the heart wearies a little of the truth, which at the outset had authority over us to cause us to walk in the truth in separation from human systems; and at the same time the mind gets more and more occupied with persons who compose the assembly, till at last the truth gives way to the persons in our hearts, the conscience to the intelligence, Christ to the man, and brethren become, in another way, a system of the worst description: this is Satan's aim, and it is in this way that he assails the brethren.<a name=116:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The first fruit from this bad root is, that brethren are occupied with themselves to the exclusion of other Christians who are equally members of the body of Christ: they think of themselves more than of the Lord.<a name=116:4></a> They do all they can to keep the gathering together, losing sight more or less of the great truths which have acted upon hearts individually, and which truths formed the gathering, not as a great work visible and recognised on the earth, but as a <i>testimony</i> from God and for the glory of Christ in the midst of Christianity.<a name=116:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is of the last importance that we should continually remember that brethren are a testimony and <i>nothing</i> else; that is to say, that it is the truth that has kept us for the glory of Christ, and not we ourselves.<a name=116:6></a> This is easily forgotten.<a name=116:7></a> I have particularly noticed proofs of this in Switzerland for the last six years at least.<a name=116:8></a> A late fruit from this root is, that Christian conscience has become valueless from

		But the test is general; it touches closely each one: that is why so many assemblies, and brethren individually in each assembly, are affected by it.<a name=117:5></a> In some cases the assembly is of one mind; in others there are two parties, more or less equal, one holding on to the truth at any cost, the other thinking more of only what is on the surface; and there may be other reasons acting upon many, leading them to follow a course which seems to them more easy.<a name=117:6></a> It has always been thus.<a name=117:7></a> Lot walked a long time with Abraham without his faith being put to the test: when the time for the test came he must walk alone, and then is seen for the first time the measure of truth that he really possessed in his soul.<a name=117:8></a> This is what is happening at the present time, and no one can determine the precise moment when such and such a soul will be put to the test; and we should be wrong in forcing or hastening the test in any way whatever, and even when it is there, to suppose that every one will be tested in the same manner.<a name=117:9></a> All this is in God's hand: nevertheless when such a sifting does come, happy are they who profit by it, receiving the test as from God with searching of heart; or better, seeking to get into the presence of God that He may search it, so that all that interferes with the glory of Christ shall be judged and put away.<a name=117:10></a>

		Much controversy arose over the matter of eternal life, which eventuated in a separation among brethren often referred to as the Bexhill Division.<a name=123:1></a> <a href="#123:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> With many, whose minds were not formed by the way the truth is presented in Scripture, eternal life was regarded as no more than the assurance, through faith in Christ, of never coming into condemnation, whereas Scripture presents it, so far as its present aspect is concerned, as a portion entered into, by the Spirit.<a name=123:2></a> It was in the mind of God for men in giving His only-begotten Son (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:16">John  3:16</a>) and eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord is presented as the gift (or act of favour) of God in contrast to the wages of sin; <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:23">Romans  6:23</a>.<a name=123:3></a> In some scriptures it is viewed as a portion to be entered into in the future, as for example, <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#25:46">Matthew  25:46</a>; <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#10:30">Mark  10:30</a>; <a href="../bible/Jude.htm#21">Jude  21</a>, but in John's writings, as well as elsewhere in Scripture, it is presented as given us now in the Son (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:11">1 John  5:11</a>), to be entered upon in the Spirit (<a href="../bible/John.htm#4:14">John  4:14</a>), to be sustained by continually eating the flesh of the Son of Man and drinking His blood (<a href="../bible/John.htm#6:54">John  6:54</a>), and to consist in abiding in the Son and in the Father (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:24">1 John  2:24</a>, 25) and in the knowledge of the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom He had sent; (<a href="../bible/John.htm#17:3">John  17:3</a>).<a name=123:4></a> It is enjoyed in the circle of the brethren, where love reigns; (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:13">1 John  3:13</a>, 14).<a name=123:5></a> Timothy, who, needless to say, was already a believer when Paul wrote to him, was exhorted to "lay hold of eternal life" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#6:12">1 Timothy  6:12</a>), in contrast to desiring to be rich (verse 9).<a name=123:6></a> In the natural order of things life is not mere existence, but consists in relationships, with the

		Difficulties have arisen in the minds of some whom I esteem as to certain expressions in the American notes on the subject of eternal life, but I think that the root of them lies in not apprehending how the scriptures on the subject present themselves to my mind.<a name=132:9></a> I may be right or I may be wrong, but anyway, it is not at all a question of any thoughts of my own but of the way in which Scripture is apprehended, and I think that those that find difficulty might try to look at things as they present themselves to me before refusing them.<a name=132:10></a> I do not in the matter in any way make light of the work of God in the believer, but on the contrary insist on it as that by which alone eternal life can be entered into, but the point with me is that what is wrought in the believer is not spoken of as eternal life, but is the preparation or the means by which he enters into it.<a name=132:11></a> A man is born again, is enlightened by the gospel and is then sealed by the Spirit, and it is then that by the Spirit he enters into eternal life.<a name=132:12></a> This is in accord with Scripture, which teaches that the living water that Christ gives is in the believer a well of water springing up unto everlasting life; that he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life eternal; and,

		again, that being made free from sin and having become servants to God, we have our fruit unto holiness and the end eternal life.<a name=133:1></a> These passages shew conclusively that the work of God <i>in us</i> is not spoken of as eternal life, but as leading to or ending in it.<a name=133:2></a> It is a great point to apprehend this.<a name=133:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then comes another point, that is, as to the part faith has in it.<a name=133:4></a> The passage, "He that believeth hath everlasting life", is quoted, and so it is said that eternal life is had by faith.<a name=133:5></a> It is certain that no one has it without faith, for a man must have been enlightened by the gospel in order to have the Spirit, but the teaching of Scripture is not that a man gets it by faith, but that the believer is the person who has it.<a name=133:6></a> I might say, by way of illustration, that a member of Parliament votes because he is a member.<a name=133:7></a> This is true; it is his qualification to vote, and yet it is not the cause of his voting.<a name=133:8></a> This is because he belongs to a party and votes according to that party; that is the immediate cause of his voting, though I might well say that a member votes.<a name=133:9></a> A believer has eternal life because he is a believer, that is his title or qualification, but the immediate cause of his having eternal life is that he has the Spirit.<a name=133:10></a> It is that in him which springs up into it.<a name=133:11></a> He has eternal life as being a believer, so that I say the believer has eternal life, as I would say the member votes, but, then, he needs the Spirit to enter into it, as the member needs opinions or party to lead him to vote.<a name=133:12></a> His opinions are not his title, but they are his power, so having the Spirit is not the title to the believer, but faith which apprehends Christ in whom eternal life is.<a name=133:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This leads me to another point as to faith, namely, that one is not called upon to believe anything as to oneself, but faith apprehends what is true in Christ.<a name=133:14></a> I am not called upon to believe that <i>I</i> have eternal life, but that eternal life is in Christ for man -- that He is it.<a name=133:15></a> Scripture is explicit that eternal life is in

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=134>[Page 134]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ -- it is God's gift in Christ, and when faith is there, the seal of the Spirit is given so that we may appropriate what is there in Christ for man.<a name=134:1></a> It is ever there, and Christ is no poorer by our appropriation.<a name=134:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is a very important principle.<a name=134:3></a> I do not want to believe anything about myself in particular, but what is in Christ for all men and, therefore, for me, and this faith is sealed by the Spirit and then begins the principle of appropriation, and this goes on as we advance in the knowledge of God, and so that all that God gives is morally in accord with Himself.<a name=134:4></a> Redemption is according and suitable to His grace.<a name=134:5></a> Salvation is according to His mercy and eternal life is according to His love, and as we apprehend these principles in God, we are enabled to reach our own blessings.<a name=134:6></a> It is certain that eternal life is constantly spoken of in Scripture as something to be entered into; the question therefore arises as to <i>what</i> it is that is to be entered into.<a name=134:7></a> The power or qualification to enter into it I have already spoken of.<a name=134:8></a> This is the springing up of the well of water in the believer.<a name=134:9></a> What is "entered into" is said to be eternal life.<a name=134:10></a> It must be something external to the believer or he could not be said to enter into it.<a name=134:11></a> He enters into it in soul.<a name=134:12></a> I might illustrate it in this way.<a name=134:13></a> When a child is born it enters into the elements of life which it finds existing, such as rule, atmosphere and light; and these things are life to the newly-born infant, without them it could not live.<a name=134:14></a> Had there not been sin man would doubtless have lived in them for ever, but the fall brought into the state of man the principle of non-continuance.<a name=134:15></a> Thus what is life to the infant, and, without which, even Adam could not have lived, is apprehended by us as objective.<a name=134:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in spiritual things the same principle is true -- the believer is born of God and in this way is qualified to enter into the appointed conditions.<a name=134:17></a> Just as the

		newly-born infant has a body subject to natural laws, lungs that can take in the air, eyes that can enjoy the light, so the believer, being born of God, is capable of entering into the conditions of life which God has appointed.<a name=135:1></a> These are, as in natural things, rule, atmosphere and light.<a name=135:2></a> Rule is found in abiding in Christ, so that the believer is delivered from lawlessness; he does not sin because he is under the law or influence of Christ.<a name=135:3></a> Atmosphere is found in the Christian circle, where the love of Christ pervades all, and in that the believer is delivered from a world of hatred and death.<a name=135:4></a> "We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren".<a name=135:5></a> Light is found in the perfect setting forth of God's disposition towards us in Christ, made good in us by the Spirit; Christ is the proof of what the love of God towards us is.<a name=135:6></a> We have thus seen what are the elements of life, and it is <i>in them</i> that eternal life consists, and they are there for us to enter into by the Spirit, and in entering into them we are conscious that we have eternal life, as we are told by the apostle John.<a name=135:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another point as to which objection has been raised, namely, the application of the thought of eternal life to earth.<a name=135:8></a> I certainly am unable to find any Scripture that connects it with heaven.<a name=135:9></a> It may be said that Christ is it, but this is in its application towards earth, and the principles of which I have spoken as making up eternal life properly apply to earth, such as rule, or kingdom, the bearing of which is towards earth.<a name=135:10></a> If Scripture anywhere speaks of eternal life in connection with heaven, I shall certainly receive it, but wherever it is spoken of, it appears connected with God's ways on earth.<a name=135:11></a> In Matthew, Mark and Luke it is connected with the coming age and John gives it a present application.<a name=135:12></a> I therefore prefer to take it up in that light.<a name=135:13></a> It has been said that I limit it, but this is not my thought, but to put

		THE PERSON OF THE CHRIST - F.E.R.
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		While extremely unwilling to enter on the field of controversy, especially on subjects touching the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ, I have thought it right, in the interests of the truth and of the Lord's people, to put out a few remarks on two points of importance which have been in question.<a name=145:10></a> In so doing I decline to reply to any attacks which have appeared, based on isolated statements culled from letters I have written, partly from reluctance to notice them, and partly because I see in these attacks the tendency to shift (it may be almost unconsciously) the ground of conflict, in order to gain a point of vantage.<a name=145:11></a> In what I have to say I adhere therefore to two points that have been in question, which are these: --
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		1. As to whether Christ is ever viewed in scripture as man, distinct and apart from what He is as God.<a name=145:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		2. As to whether the truth of His Person consists in the union in Him of God and man; a favourite formula with those so holding is "God and man one Christ" -- and with this is connected the idea that every title referring to Christ covers the whole truth of His Person.<a name=145:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I affirm that the denial of the first, while claiming to maintain orthodoxy, is destructive of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=146>[Page 146]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christianity in its real power; and I would affectionately warn saints against giving up, in zeal for orthodoxy, the blessed foundations of Christianity.<a name=146:1></a> Further, that the assertion of the second is derogatory and dishonouring to the Son; and I proceed to shew that both the denial and the assertion are contrary to the teaching of Scripture.<a name=146:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first betrays a singular inability to apprehend the great reality of the incarnation, at all events in a most essential aspect of it, namely, the fact of Christ having by it a place as man <i>Godward</i>.<a name=146:3></a> As the Word became flesh He dwelt among men and revealed God, and in Him all the fulness was pleased to dwell; but He Himself filled and still fills a place as Man towards God (see <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16">Psalm  16</a>); and the two thoughts are wholly distinct conceptions, which cannot be grasped at one and the same time by any finite mind.<a name=146:4></a> "No one knows the Son but the Father".<a name=146:5></a> As Man He is both Apostle and High Priest.<a name=146:6></a> In other words, in the Apostle God has, so to say, come out, and in the High Priest man has entered in.<a name=146:7></a> Now these two thoughts, though realised in one Person, must of necessity be separately and distinctly apprehended.<a name=146:8></a> The one presents God, the other, man.<a name=146:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The reality of Christ's manhood in its aspect Godward is amply presented in the New Testament.<a name=146:10></a> There we have the truth, that Christ, having died to sin once, lives to God; <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>.<a name=146:11></a> The having put off the old man and having put on the new is said to be "as the truth is in Jesus", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4">Ephesians  4</a>.<a name=146:12></a> Christ Jesus before Pontius Pilate witnessed the good confession; <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#6">1 Timothy  6</a>.<a name=146:13></a> He sings praises to God in the midst of the assembly; <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>.<a name=146:14></a> He praises in the great congregation, <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>, he has entered in for us as Forerunner; <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#6">Hebrews  6</a>.<a name=146:15></a> He appears in the presence of God for us; <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9">Hebrews  9</a>.<a name=146:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, while fully admitting that, morally, Christ's manhood had its unique and blessed character from
	</div>

		<a name=147>[Page 147]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God, for in becoming man He gave character to manhood, yet in the thoughts above presented it is utterly impossible to introduce the idea of Deity in its proper character and attributes, because in every case it is man that is presented, or rather, Christ is viewed in the light of man Godward.<a name=147:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The refusal of this is destructive of Christianity in its true power, for it is on the side that I have indicated that Christ is placed within the reach of our appropriation, so that we can eat Him and live by Him.<a name=147:2></a> He is, as second Man, the pattern of our blessing, the Leader of our salvation.<a name=147:3></a> He draws us to Himself by making known to us His love; and the affection on our part begotten by this appropriates Him as the expression and pattern of what we are according to the counsel of God; and it is in this way that the believer is led into the true sense of the greatness of his portion, and even partakes morally in the life of God.<a name=147:4></a> As "Lord" Christ is the Object of faith, as Head He is held by the believer, who is led by Him into heavenly blessing.<a name=147:5></a> Hence I am entirely at a loss to understand how the truth of Christianity can be maintained in the absence of the apprehension of Christ in His place as man Godward, distinct and apart from the glory and attributes which belong only to God, and in which Christ has part as Himself being a divine Person.<a name=147:6></a>

The mystery.<a name=148:1></a> They have no true conception that the church is the complement of <i>the Man</i> who glorified God here; but while admitting that all saints are united to Christ, they are leavened with the error that they are united to the Son of God, and they thus betray their ignorance of the mystery.<a name=148:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence it is not surprising that many find difficulty in the apprehension of Christ in the point of view which I have sought to make plain.<a name=148:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second error maintains that the truth of <i>Christ's Person</i> consists in the union in Him of God and man.<a name=148:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, this idea arises, I judge, from confusion of thought as between <i>person</i> and <i>condition</i>, and has been fostered by expressions found in hymns, and the like, which have been used simply and devoutly by Christians without any very strict inquiry into their real force; but it involves a thought very derogatory to the truth of the Son, namely, that in becoming man a change has taken place as to His Person -- He is <i>in Person</i> something which He was not before.<a name=148:5></a> This is not the teaching of Scripture, nor do I think that it can be entertained.<a name=148:6></a> When I come to the word, I find that while in three gospels the truth of Christ in certain official positions is prominent, the fourth (John) is given to us to afford full light as to His Person, that is, "the Son"; and in this respect He is seen in three positions, namely, as eternally with the Father, as come into the world, and as going back to the Father, the same Person unchanged and unchangeable.<a name=148:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Further than this, the Person is even viewed as acting in regard to His form or condition, divine or human; "Being in the form of God, he emptied himself and took on him a servant's form, becoming in the likeness of men".<a name=148:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He comes to do God's will in the body prepared for Him.<a name=148:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		He lays down His life (human condition) to take it again.<a name=149:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have thus a divine Person presented, even apart from the question of form, and the idea of the unity of the Person in the sense asserted is not found.<a name=149:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The One who being in the form of God, emptied Himself, and took on Him a servant's form, is the same who, having become man, humbled Himself, and became obedient to the death of the cross, and is now highly exalted.<a name=149:4></a> There is no idea either of unity, or of change, in the Person.<a name=149:5></a> It is the same person in servant's form, and entering into what that form involved.<a name=149:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The truth of a divine Person assuming human condition, the Word becoming flesh, and in such wise as that He can be viewed objectively as man, I believe; but that is not a question of unity of a Person.<a name=149:7></a> It is a Person in a condition in which He was not previously.<a name=149:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another idea connected with the above appears to be that every title or name inherited by the Son or applied to Him in Scripture embraces or covers, if it does not describe, the whole truth of His Person.<a name=149:9></a> Now I believe this to be a fallacy, and a mistaken way of apprehending Scripture.<a name=149:10></a> Unquestionably the Lord is identified or designated, and designates Himself, by official names or titles, as "the Christ" or "Son of man"; but such titles, though serving sufficiently to identify or designate the Person, do not cover the truth of His Person; and different titles applied to or fulfilled in Christ have to be understood each within its own appropriate limits.<a name=149:11></a> They describe the office, but not the person that holds the office.<a name=149:12></a> In the same way we commonly use official and acquired titles as "The Queen", "The Colonel", "The Doctor", to identify or designate a person, but we have no idea that such a title is descriptive of the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=150>[Page 150]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		person, or covers all that is true of the person, though once the person is so designated, many things can be said which refer to the person, and have nothing whatever to do with the particular designation; for instance, I might say, "When the Queen was a child".<a name=150:1></a> She was not queen as a child.<a name=150:2></a> It is simply a title used for designation, which has its own particular force and meaning.<a name=150:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Jesus is the anointed of God, that is, the Christ, but not properly so until He was anointed, whatever might be true in purpose.<a name=150:4></a> So too, He was not Son of man until He became man, yet He says "The Son of man came to minister".<a name=150:5></a> "What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before".<a name=150:6></a> "The Son of man which is in heaven".<a name=150:7></a> The simple fact is that a title serves to designate the Person, without being descriptive of the Person, or involving any question of the unity of the Person.<a name=150:8></a> The titles "The Christ" and "Son of man" are both official titles which could have had no place or meaning except in the Son having become man; and it is remarkable that the Lord does not in the gospels use what is, perhaps, the nearest approach to a personal name, that is, Jesus, in the same way.<a name=150:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In conclusion, I earnestly entreat saints to come prayerfully and patiently to Scripture to get their thoughts of Christ formed by the word of God; and not to adopt the creeds or moulds into which men, often with pious intent, have cast the truth in the vain effort to guard against error; and it is significant that those who have of late come forward to expose what they deemed to be error, have shewn a tendency in their minds in the direction of a kind of Tritheism.<a name=150:10></a> It is not in this way that the truth of Christ's Person is guarded, or that of the unity of the Godhead maintained.<a name=150:11></a>

		GLANTON AND ALNWICK, 1908
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Matters which arose in 1908 in connection with the two neighbouring meetings of Glanton and Alnwick, resulting in what has often been referred to as "the Glanton trouble", served to emphasise the important principle that responsibility to the Lord for the testimony in each city or place attaches to the assembly in that place.<a name=151:1></a> This is in keeping with the instruction in the first epistle to the Corinthians, which is addressed to "the assembly of God which is in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, <i>with all that in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ</i>, both theirs and ours".<a name=151:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The facts were as follows.<a name=151:3></a> In the town of Alnwick serious personal differences had arisen among those breaking bread.<a name=151:4></a> It may here be remarked that <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#5:23">Matthew  5:23</a>, 24, and <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:15">Matthew  18:15</a> - 17, indicate the means by which personal differences between brethren are to be settled, and it is the responsibility of the spiritual, and ultimately of the assembly in the locality, to see that these means are adopted wherever such differences arise.<a name=151:5></a> The verses that immediately follow the passages cited above, that is <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#5:25">Matthew  5:25</a>, 26, and <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:21">Matthew  18:21</a> - 35, shew what serious consequences to an individual may result if the divinely ordered procedure is not followed, but in following the procedure a befitting spirit of uprightness, meekness and forgiveness is essential.<a name=151:6></a> In the unhappy case of the meeting at Alnwick, however, the differences were not settled, with the result that eventually it divided into two parties, each of which appealed for the fellowship of gatherings around.<a name=151:7></a> It was not a case of one party being committed to some error in truth, or wrong principle, from which the other party withdrew in faithfulness to the name of the Lord, but simply of disunity,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=152>[Page 152]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		resulting from personal differences, of so serious a character that it was impossible for the brethren to go on together.<a name=152:1></a> Some of those who had ceased to break bread at Alnwick started attending the meetings at Glanton, a few miles away, and were eventually received by the brethren there to the breaking of bread, ignoring the responsibility that attached to them, with the rest of their brethren at Alnwick, to humble themselves before the Lord in Alnwick in relation to the confusion that existed there, and to adopt the means provided in the word of God to bring about reconciliation.<a name=152:2></a> Those who were thus received to the breaking of bread at Glanton were subsequently sent back to Alnwick as the recognised company in that place.<a name=152:3></a> The infringement of divine principles involved in their action was pointed out to the brethren at Glanton by many, but as they maintained it and claimed that it must be recognised as done in the name of the Lord, others supporting them in the position they took up, a separation among brethren became inevitable.<a name=152:4></a>

		The gravity of such a case required that it should not be left undetermined; it had to be definitely taken up <i>somewhere</i>, and it was ordained by God that the nearest city should do so.<a name=156:5></a> It was not left to any city to act that might feel inclined to do so; responsibility to do so on behalf of God's people generally was definitely assigned to a particular city.<a name=156:6></a> Divine support can always be counted on when responsibility is taken up according to the mind of God.<a name=156:7></a>

		Christian fellowship is general as well as local, and so if its practical expression in a locality ceases through division among the saints there, the general aspect is involved; in principle responsibility as to it belongs to all the gatherings.<a name=160:3></a> This is recognised in verse 2, "thy elders and thy judges", but afterwards <i>all rests with the nearest city and the priesthood</i>, the elders of the former merging into the latter.<a name=160:4></a> Thus a local sorrow, such as we are contemplating, after general responsibility is accepted, resolves itself into proximity and priesthood.<a name=160:5></a> These must go together, and as they do, the nearest meeting will not act arbitrarily, or officially, but on moral grounds, recognising that what they have on hand is not in their own midst and for which they are responsible to the Lord only, but in another locality, and so coming within the range of all; but that wisdom and confidence in others would leave the service of adjustment with them as the nearest to the scene of sorrow.<a name=160:6></a>

		DIVINE PRINCIPLES AND A DAY OF RUIN
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In 1920 a controversy arose as to the way in which evil, when found amongst us, should be dealt with.<a name=163:1></a> It involved the careful consideration of <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5">1 Corinthians  5</a>, and <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:19">2 Timothy  2:19</a> - 22, with a view to discerning the way to maintain uncompromisingly the holiness which ever becomes the house of God in a manner consistent with the humble recognition of the conditions of brokenness that mark the days we are in.<a name=163:2></a> The exercise which the controversy aroused resulted in the general recognition that it was unbecoming for the saints in any place who are truly separated to the name of the Lord Jesus to assume, in their public actions, to be the assembly of God in the place, and thus to have competence, as the Corinthians had, to <i>remove a wicked person from amongst them</i>, as it is clear that when the apostle wrote to the Corinthians there was the one assembly in Corinth comprising all true believers in the city, and spoken of in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5:12">1 Corinthians  5:12</a>, as "within", in contrast to which there were "those outside".<a name=163:3></a> Anyone therefore removed from amongst the Corinthians would find himself among "those outside" the whole company of believers in the city, whereas at the present time anyone ceasing to be recognised as identified with a particular company of believers can, and, alas, not infrequently does, associate himself with another company of believers.<a name=163:4></a> Such is the state of confusion publicly that marks Christendom, which is described in the second epistle to Timothy as "a great house", in which "there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also wooden and earthen; and some to honour and some to dishonour".<a name=163:5></a> In this condition of things, the divine provision is in the instruction which immediately follows, viz.<a name=163:6></a>, "If therefore one shall have purified himself from these, in separating himself from them, he shall be a vessel to honour, sanctified, serviceable to the Master, prepared

		of all who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=166:1></a> I think this is the scope of the Scripture in a just and sober interpretation of it, taken in its divine setting in an epistle addressed as <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:2">1 Corinthians  1:2</a>.<a name=166:2></a> I hold that it is obligatory not only on all saints, but on all who call upon that holy name, even though it be in profession only.<a name=166:3></a> That, in its full and proper scope, it is not now obeyed is obvious, and is the evidence of departure and ruin, which is humbling to us all as having our part in it.<a name=166:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am unable to see that the acceptance of the above interpretation involves that "we must necessarily judge as evil all the various judgments of the past and consequently our own present position".<a name=166:5></a> It seems to me that if brethren had now come to the conclusion that it was <i>wrong</i> to exclude a wicked person from their fellowship there would be force in your argument!<a name=166:6></a> But the matter is on quite a different footing from this.<a name=166:7></a> Brethren are, thank God, as much set to exclude evil from their associations as ever.<a name=166:8></a> They regard those "various judgments" as morally right, and as come to in the fear of God, with true and upright desire to maintain what was due to the Lord, and what was suitable to the abode of God's holiness.<a name=166:9></a> But there have been many things in the practice of brethren, and terms frequently used in years past, which have quietly dropped out through exercise in the presence of increased light.<a name=166:10></a> For many years, and particularly since we were so much helped by F.<a name=166:11></a>E.<a name=166:12></a>R.<a name=166:13></a>'s ministry, brethren generally have been exercised to avoid taking any ground, or using any terms, that might seem to involve pretension in the scene and circumstances of the church's ruin.<a name=166:14></a> But we do not "judge as evil" what was done uprightly, and for the honour of the Lord's name, and which was, as to its substance, approved of Him, though we might not feel free to do things just in the same way now.<a name=166:15></a> We do not "judge as evil" the measure of

		light and truth we had forty years ago, though we were happy to say and do many things then which we should not say or do now.<a name=167:1></a> To be thankful for increased light does not involve that we "judge as evil" our former measure of spiritual intelligence and growth.<a name=167:2></a> The "dilemma" you speak of does not present itself to my mind as being such at all.<a name=167:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would suggest that the "ground" on which any action may be taken is distinguishable from the "object" or "motive".<a name=167:4></a> It is true that all links with an evil-doer should be severed on the "ground" that he is unfit for any Christian fellowship.<a name=167:5></a> But the "object" in view would be, first, to maintain conditions suitable to the Lord, and in accord with His holy name, and in keeping with the character of God's house.<a name=167:6></a> And, secondly, in the spirit of grace and love, that the offender might be exercised, convicted, and fully restored.<a name=167:7></a> The "motive" in all that was done would be the obedience of faith working through love .<a name=167:8></a>.<a name=167:9></a>.<a name=167:10></a>

		My power is very small, but I would certainly earnestly desire to use it to the utmost to prevent disintegration, and to build saints up in Christ, so that as formed in the divine nature they may be comforted and knit together in love.<a name=167:11></a> May we have wisdom to discern the movements which really tend to divide and scatter, and spiritual power to resist them as strong in the Lord and in the might of His strength.<a name=167:12></a> And in every way may we be found "seeking the wealth of his people, and speaking peace to all his seed"!<a name=167:13></a>

		... Brethren generally are in such substantial agreement as to the principles involved in the present exercise that the idea of division on the subject seems to be simply preposterous.<a name=168:2></a> As to the essential matters, which might justly be regarded as vital to fellowship, there seems to be, happily, universal concurrence of judgment.<a name=168:3></a> That is (1) that all links of association or fellowship with a wicked person should be severed, and (2) that all ecclesiastical pretension should be felt to be utterly unsuitable in the present condition of the church.<a name=168:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But a third question has come in, and become the occasion of diverse judgments running in some cases to the point of serious difference.<a name=168:5></a> That is, whether as to our public attitude, and the public statement of that attitude, in relation to a wicked person, we should take church ground and put him away from amongst ourselves, as could be done at Corinth, or whether it is not more suitable and seemly to take 2 Timothy ground and to act together on the basis of individual faithfulness, but, of course, in the light of all assembly truth and principles.<a name=168:6></a> It must be one or the other.<a name=168:7></a> Whatever terms are used there is really no middle course.<a name=168:8></a> Much has been brought before us in ministry as to this for many years past, and it seems to be the Lord's mind that this question should be now definitely faced.<a name=168:9></a>

		The very fact that there is exercise, with different phases of expression, but which in each case maintains with jealous care separation from evil, and the purity of the saints' associations, and the honour due to the Lord's name, is something to be thankful for, It is evidence that the Lord is not suffering us to drop down into formality, but is preserving exercise as to the import of things, and as to the moral state which can alone take them up rightly.<a name=168:10></a> There is nothing in

		the exercise which, in my judgment, should be regarded as raising the question of fellowship.<a name=169:1></a> It is an exercise for brethren to take up together, and to seek the Lord about, that He may make clear His mind and confirm it in the judgment of His saints.<a name=169:2></a> It is surely not a matter which calls for division.<a name=169:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I go most fully with what has been said; viz.<a name=169:4></a>, "The church -- as set up in responsibility here -- has failed, and there is no corporate body now that we can look to.<a name=169:5></a> We must recognise this, and our own part, too, as contributing to the failure.<a name=169:6></a> Further, it is a principle in the ways of God that when the corporate thing fails the principles that belong to it are maintained in individual faithfulness".<a name=169:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A principle clearly laid down in <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2">2 Timothy  2</a>is that of withdrawing or separation from iniquity or vessels to dishonour.<a name=169:8></a> It is a principle of very wide -- we might say universal -- application.<a name=169:9></a> If it is true that we cannot now look to any corporate body to maintain divine principles, in individual faithfulness we can still act on this basic principle of withdrawal or separation from what is evil.<a name=169:10></a> It is a most valuable divine provision for the last days.<a name=169:11></a> The faithful saint can never be forced to accept association with evil; he can always withdraw from it.<a name=169:12></a> If <i>two</i> were walking together, and one of them became characteristically a wicked person the other could, and would, withdraw from him.<a name=169:13></a> And if fifty or five hundred are walking together, each one must walk individually in regard to him on the withdrawal principle.<a name=169:14></a> It is only as each one acts on this principle that we can follow righteousness together.<a name=169:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in dealing with such a person those who walk together act together.<a name=169:16></a> And the question arises whether there may not be an element in such collective action additional to that of individual withdrawal.<a name=169:17></a> I cannot doubt that when faithful saints thus act there is an additional element, and a very important one.<a name=169:18></a> If

		"two or three" take action, as gathered together to the Lord's name, and with the support and sanction of His presence, their action -- as to spiritual reality, and in the estimation of faith -- has assembly character.<a name=170:1></a> The Lord's presence, and His power and authority, are concerned in the matter.<a name=170:2></a> But the support and confidence which the consciousness of this gives are known only to faith and love, and to the holy and priestly exercises of saints in private with God.<a name=170:3></a> I think we should instinctively feel that it would be out of place and unbecoming to take or claim any such ground as to our public position here.<a name=170:4></a> Every sober and lowly mind would shrink from it as savouring of pretension.<a name=170:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now it seems to me that if the difference between these two things were recognised, as it ought to be, the difficulties as to present exercises would be greatly diminished.<a name=170:6></a> Some seem to fear that the first is in danger of being given up.<a name=170:7></a> No one has any thought of giving it up; it is the supreme joy and strength of faith.<a name=170:8></a> But what is said or done in public should be in keeping with the public position, which is that of a few feeble individuals seeking to walk together in the truth in the midst of assembly ruin and confessing that ruin.<a name=170:9></a> Hence if brethren feel it comely to say that they "withdraw" from a wicked person I cannot regard such action as an evil so great that it ought to be separated from.<a name=170:10></a> It is, at any rate, safe ground to take, as based on a clear divine principle of universal application.<a name=170:11></a> And it is unpretentious, and consistent with a condition of things when, admittedly, "there is no corporate body that we can look to".<a name=170:12></a> It is acting on a broad divine principle which is clearly available even in the most extreme conditions of weakness, and it surrenders nothing unless it be the claim to act publicly as having church position and the presence and power of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=170:13></a> But surely all saints would agree that this latter, as I have

	<div class="paragraph">
		The exercise as to this matter may appear to some to be a mere quibble about words.<a name=188:3></a> But I am convinced that when saints consider it soberly apart from the atmosphere and spirit of controversy, and especially apart from any thought that it involves separation from our brethren, they will realise that it is perhaps more important than at first appeared.<a name=188:4></a> The exercise has been wide-spread, and one feels constrained to believe that, under the Lord's hand, there is needed divine instruction in it.<a name=188:5></a> May it be our concern to see what that instruction is and profit by it!<a name=188:6></a> And may we be subject to one another in the fear of Christ, and be ready to give due place to every part of the truth!<a name=188:7></a> May God enable us, in this last solemn and critical moment, when the enemy is seeking to disintegrate and scatter, to lay ourselves out diligently to endeavour to keep the unity of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace!<a name=188:8></a>

		enquiry into the truth which the above-quoted remarks at Barnet provoked, it became clear that it is only as having become incarnate that the Lord is spoken of as Son, and that for us to assume to carry back into time prior to the incarnation, or into the conditions of absolute Deity, titles and relationships that have only come into view consequent on the incarnation, is to go beyond what Scripture warrants, and results in our unconsciously attributing to the Lord, in His personal glory as in the Deity, a place that is subordinate or secondary, He being thus robbed in our minds of His full glory personally as equal in the Godhead with the Father and the Spirit.<a name=206:1></a> If the truth as to the Person of Christ is fully held in our hearts, the glory of the incarnation, and of the relative positions taken up by the Persons of the Godhead, in order that God might be known in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, becomes greater to us, and promotes an increased spirit of worship.<a name=206:2></a>

		EVENTS RELATING TO CHINA
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For some time prior to May, 1932, information had been circulated widely in England, America, Australia and elsewhere as to the existence in China of a work of God among the Chinese, which had taken form in a fellowship which appeared to be based on the truth, and it was accordingly resolved at that time that a number of brethren should visit China with a view to ascertaining the facts.<a name=216:1></a> As a result six brothers, two from England, three from Australia, and one from America, and two sisters, wives of two of the brothers, visited China during October, November and December, 1932.<a name=216:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		They found that a number of meetings of believers were in existence in the country moving in fellowship with each other, but in separation from denominational systems, and apparently governed by the truth and supported by the Spirit.<a name=216:3></a> In this work of God, Mr.<a name=216:4></a> W.<a name=216:5></a> Nee, who had been marked by considerable ability and devotedness, had been much used in blessing in the gospel and in ministering to the saints.<a name=216:6></a> He had been helped by some ministry by Mr.<a name=216:7></a> J.<a name=216:8></a> N.<a name=216:9></a> Darby which had come into his hands, and it was his writing to London to enquire whether further ministry of the same kind was available that had first drawn the attention of saints in the western world to the existence of this work of God in China.<a name=216:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The visiting brethren, feeling assured that there was no reason why we should not be identified in fellowship with the brethren they had met in China, broke bread with them on November 6th, 1932, after having first communicated by cable with brethren at Vancouver and Brisbane, two neighbouring meetings, and been assured of their fellowship with them in so doing.<a name=216:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		America and attended many of the meetings as one fully accredited as in fellowship.<a name=217:1></a> At some of these meetings he ministered the word.<a name=217:2></a> After he had left England for America, it came to light that, unknown to brethren at the time, he had on one occasion broken bread with an independent company of Christians in London known as The Honor Oak Christian Fellowship Centre, which, though not identified with "Open" brethren, was governed by their principles in that anyone claiming to be a believer was allowed to break bread without regard to the religious and other associations in which he was involved.<a name=217:3></a> During his visit to America Mr.<a name=217:4></a> Nee similarly compromised the fellowship by breaking bread with some who were identified with certain sectarian bodies.<a name=217:5></a> As a consequence letters passed between the brethren in New York and those in Shanghai, on the one hand, and between the brethren in London and those in Shanghai, on the other, seeking to enlighten the Shanghai brethren as to the principles of Christian fellowship and to help them to judge the actions of Mr.<a name=217:6></a> Nee above referred to.<a name=217:7></a> Occasion was also taken to call attention to the fact that Mr.<a name=217:8></a> Nee held unsound views as to the rapture of the saints, and also regarded the symbolical teaching of the book of Revelation as literal.<a name=217:9></a> The serious character of certain teaching which emanated from the Honor Oak Christian Fellowship Centre was also pointed out.<a name=217:10></a> The correspondence continued over a protracted period, considerable time elapsing between the date of each letter to China and its reply.<a name=217:11></a> The final letter from the brethren in Shanghai addressed to the brethren in London was dated July 2nd, 1935; in it certain principles were laid down, among which were the following: --
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"We are to receive all the children of God whom He has received for Christ's sake".<a name=217:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		On receipt of this letter a meeting of assembly character was held in London on July 30th, 1935, at which it was decided that we could not remain identified with those who held such principles, and this decision was communicated to the brethren in China by the following letter dated August 31st, 1935.<a name=218:4></a>

		THE PUBLIC TESTIMONY TO CONSCIENCE BEFORE GOD, MILITARY SERVICE, 1914 - 1918 AND 1939 - 1945, TRADE UNIONISM
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The introduction during the two world wars of 1914 - 1918 and 1939 - 1945 of compulsory military service in the British Empire and America, where previously such service had been voluntary, and the rapid development, especially since the end of the second of those wars, of trade unionism, have brought to the fore the question of the paramount rights of God over the believer, and the consequent necessity that the believer should maintain a good conscience before Him in all that he does.<a name=223:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Great Britain and most parts of the British Empire, and also in America, provision was made by law enabling an application for exemption from military service, or from combatant military service, to be made by anyone otherwise liable to such service who objected to it on conscientious grounds, and, as a result, a way was made in the mercy of God for every instructed believer, rightly feeling that he could not with a good conscience take life, to preserve his conscience and at the same time accord to the authorities whom God has placed over him the subjection that the will of God requires.<a name=223:2></a> The exercise resulting from this was twofold.<a name=223:3></a> In the first place it helped to make clear the distinction between "the world" as a system lying in the wicked one from which the believer is to keep himself unspotted, and the authorities, ordained of God, and ministers of God to us for good, to which the believer is to render subjection "for conscience sake" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#13:5">Romans  13:5</a>).<a name=223:4></a> In the second place, the application for exemption imposed on each applicant the necessity to determine at what point his general responsibility to obey the requirements

		of the law as to military service was modified by his responsibility, as a matter of conscience before God, to do nothing inconsistent with the testimony to God as a Saviour God made known in the one Mediator, Who gave Himself a ransom for all.<a name=224:1></a> Each application had therefore to be a matter of genuine conscience, and not something to be taken up in the hope of avoiding what was uncongenial.<a name=224:2></a> The testimony rendered before the tribunals by those who appealed as exercised believers served to bring to the notice of the authorities, time after time, that there were those whose first concern was to please God in all things, and to maintain what was due to Him, and in their confession the name of the Lord Jesus was publicly honoured, while the fact that many who were not true believers at all claimed exemption on various "conscientious" grounds, but frequently, either by their conduct or by the absence of sound principle in their claims, failed to commend themselves, only served, by contrast, to bear further testimony to the truth.<a name=224:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Of recent years trade unionism has greatly increased in power, and, in its declared policy of endeavouring to embrace every worker, has adopted arbitrary and murderous methods of enforcing its will.<a name=224:4></a> Many unions have, under threat of strikes, forced employers to dismiss from their employment any worker who is not a member of the union, and they have no compunction, whatever be the reason for non-membership, about robbing a non-member of his means of livelihood.<a name=224:5></a> It is clear from Scripture that a believer, on account of conscience before God, cannot be a member of a trade union.<a name=224:6></a> "Be not diversely yoked with unbelievers; for what participation is there between righteousness and lawlessness?<a name=224:7></a> .<a name=224:8></a>.<a name=224:9></a>.<a name=224:10></a> Wherefore come out from the midst of them, and be separated, saith the Lord, and <i>touch not</i> what is unclean, and I will receive you; and I will be to you for a Father, and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Against this aggressive spirit of unionism, which seeks by intimidation to force a believer into unholy associations, and as a result to deprive him of his liberty Godward and thus to rob God of His portion in His saints, the Lord has raised up a standard in many individual believers who have refused to belong to unions, preferring to suffer rather than to surrender what is due to God, and their action has forced on the attention of Governments, municipal authorities, employers of labour, trade union officials, and the public generally the fact that God has paramount rights, and supports those who stand for them.<a name=225:7></a> The path for those who desire to be faithful is one of faith, and often entails suffering and loss circumstantially, but it is one in which the truth of what God said to Abraham is verified, "Fear not, Abram; I am thy shield, thy exceeding great reward".<a name=225:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This forcing on the attention of authorities and of men generally of the question of the rights of God, which has resulted from military service and trade unionism and is still taking place, seems to be consistent with the good confession witnessed by Christ Jesus before Pontius Pilate (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#6:13">1 Timothy  6:13</a>); namely, "I have been born for this, and for this I have come into the world, that I might <i>bear witness to the truth</i>.<a name=225:9></a> Every one that is of the truth hears my voice", <a href="../bible/John.htm#18:37">John  18:37</a>.<a name=225:10></a>

		SUPPLEMENTARY REMARKS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the foregoing recital attention has been concentrated on some of the more outstanding conflicts which the progress of the recovery of the truth has had to encounter, but conflict in one form or another has continued all down the line.<a name=226:1></a> In writing to Timothy, Paul enjoined that the truth was to be handed on by Timothy to faithful men, who would be competent to instruct others also, and then immediately added "Take thy share in suffering as a good soldier of Jesus Christ" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:2">2 Timothy  2:2</a> and 3), evidently implying that the maintenance of the truth required the taking up of a suffering and militant attitude on the part of the faithful.<a name=226:2></a> Frequently the conflicts have been confined to particular localities or areas, but in such cases it will be usually found that the principles involved were those which were at issue in the Bethesda matter or the Glanton and Alnwick matter already dealt with in these pages.<a name=226:3></a>

		SALVATION IN THE ASSEMBLY
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In 1905 the importance of the assembly as a sphere of practical salvation from the world was emphasised in ministry by Mr.<a name=226:5></a> James Taylor, and was, for a time, seriously opposed by certain well-known brethren in England.<a name=226:6></a> It is so obvious from the early chapters of the Acts that in the early days of Christianity believers found in the assembly, into which they were introduced by faith in Christ and the reception of the Spirit, a sphere in which, in the practical enjoyment of eternal life, complete deliverance from the elements of the world was realised (see <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:42">Acts  2:42</a> - 47; chapter 4: 23 - 35), that it is difficult now to understand

		how it could have been seriously contested, but the opposition that arose at that time was an effort of the enemy to use objective truth to deny or obscure the importance and value of the presence in the assembly of the Holy Spirit and His resulting work in the saints.<a name=227:1></a> In this effort the enemy found material at hand in the failure, for a time, on the part of certain leaders to recognise and acknowledge the Lord's sovereignty in using whom He would to bring out His mind for the assembly, but through the grace of the Lord the truth gradually prevailed, though many who refused a subjective line of ministry, including one of the leaders in the opposition, were carried away at the time of the Glanton issue.<a name=227:2></a> The truth brought out at this time is not only clearly set out in the Acts, but is equally clearly presented in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:7">Hebrews  11:7</a>, and in the typical teaching in Genesis to which that verse alludes.<a name=227:3></a>

		CHRIST IN THE MIDST
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In 1909 it was put out in ministry which appeared in print that the Lord had taken up an abiding position "in the midst" of the assembly (<a href="../bible/John.htm#20:19">John  20:19</a>; <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:12">Hebrews  2:12</a>), and that this formed the central truth of Christianity.<a name=227:4></a> It was said that on the day the Lord rose from the dead He fulfilled His promise in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:18">John  14:18</a>, "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you", and that He did not relinquish the position He then took up in the midst.<a name=227:5></a> It is clear from <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>itself that this is not the truth, for after saying in verse 19 that Jesus came and stood in the midst, the scripture tells us in verse 26 that eight days after His disciples were again within, and Thomas with them, and that "Jesus comes, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst".<a name=227:6></a> Moreover, in chapter 21 we read that "after these things Jesus manifested himself again to the disciples" (verse 1), and from <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:21">Acts  1:21</a>, 22, we learn that during the forty days after the Lord rose, as well as during His public

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The suggestion that the Lord has an abiding position in the midst of the assembly tended to obscure the special privilege and blessedness of His <i>coming</i> to His own from time to time, according to <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:23">John  14:23</a>, leading to the highest form of assembly service Godward, and to weaken the sense that this privilege is dependent on suitable conditions, as is clearly indicated in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:15">John  14:15</a>, 21, 23.<a name=228:2></a> It also indirectly tended to obscure the special grace and favour of the abiding presence with us, in the <i>absence</i> of Christ, of the Comforter, the Spirit of truth, in connection with Whose presence the Lord is pleased to come, from time to time, and manifest Himself to His own.<a name=228:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The wrong teaching as to Christ's abiding presence in the midst was challenged by Mr.<a name=228:4></a> J.<a name=228:5></a> Taylor, and as a result of correspondence and exercise that ensued, the article in which the teaching appeared was withdrawn in 1914.<a name=228:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The suggestion of Christ's abiding presence in the midst of the assembly having been shewn to be inconsistent with Scripture does not, of course, set aside the fact that, for support in administration and testimony, He is with us "all the days, until the completion of the age", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28:20">Matthew  28:20</a>.<a name=228:7></a>

		FULFILLED RESPONSIBILITY
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A few years later, considerable discussion arose on the question of fulfilled responsibility, there being an effort with some to press the fact that no one has, in fact, fulfilled responsibility absolutely ("we all often offend", <a href="../bible/James.htm#3:2">James  3:2</a>), to such an extent as practically to destroy the force of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:4">Romans  8:4</a>, "in order that the righteous requirement of the law should be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh but according to Spirit".<a name=228:8></a> It is clear that, as J.<a name=228:9></a>B.<a name=228:10></a>S.<a name=228:11></a> often remarked, in Christianity man's capability (as

		CONCLUSION

	<div class="paragraph">
		A careful consideration of what is set out in the preceding pages leads to the conclusion that the maintenance of the truth requires, in those who desire to walk in it, practical subjection to the Lord, a practical walk in the Spirit with the full recognition of His authority and service in the assembly, and conditions of love among the saints, but it also brings into most encouraging relief the faithfulness of the love of Christ for the assembly, and the faithful and devoted service of the Comforter, the Spirit of truth, Who is ready and able to guide into <i>all</i> the truth all who genuinely desire to walk worthily of the Lord unto all well-pleasing (see <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:10">Colossians  1:10</a>).<a name=230:1></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		At the same time, or very soon after, it was realised that the breaking of bread was expressive of the true fellowship of the church, and <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:20">Matthew  18:20</a> assured several hearts that if they were in the current of the Lord's thoughts and interests they might count upon

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Time passed on; the truth spread in all directions, and was taken up by many -- taken up spiritually by some, mentally by others.<a name=231:6></a> The enemy was roused to activity and sought to swamp the whole thing at Plymouth.<a name=231:7></a> The Spirit of God lifted up a standard against him -- again using J.<a name=231:8></a>N.<a name=231:9></a>D.<a name=231:10></a> Then Bethesda enunciated a base principle of neutrality when the Person of Christ was in question, and adopted the idea of total independency both of gatherings and of individuals.<a name=231:11></a> That is, it was a complete subversion of everything that constituted the present testimony of the Lord.<a name=231:12></a> The nature and unity of the church was quite given up.<a name=231:13></a> That is, the very thing which essentially constituted Christ's interest here was given up.<a name=231:14></a> Thus with those who went away at that time the moral evidence of the Lord's presence is entirely wanting.<a name=231:15></a>

		Dear Brother in the Lord, -- I am interested to have your letter, and to know something of your exercises before the Lord.<a name=235:6></a> I feel assured that He will help you, as you continue to seek Him about the matter, and will give you light as to the path in which He would have you to walk.<a name=235:7></a>

		I am glad that you have arrived at a definite judgment as to the failure of Open Brethren to recognise the truth of the one body in its practical bearing on the fellowship of saints.<a name=235:8></a> This will make your way clear as to continuing association with them, and it will also help you much in regard to other difficulties which beset the path of faith in this day.<a name=235:9></a>

		It is easy to answer the first part of your question.<a name=235:10></a> The Christians with whom I am privileged to walk <i>do</i> recognise the truth of the one body, and this not only in an abstract way (as I suppose all Christians do) but in its practical bearing.<a name=235:11></a> That is, the essential and vital unity of the body is not merely local but universal; <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:13">1 Corinthians  12:13</a> establishes this.<a name=235:12></a> So that local assemblies are not independent congregations who may agree to work and walk together with mutual inter-communion, but the saints who meet locally in assemblies form an integral part of a universal unity, and thus no assembly can be independent of any or all the other assemblies.<a name=235:13></a> It is not merely a question of agreeing to act on the same principles, but the unity is a vital and organic unity.<a name=235:14></a> So that any disciplinary or administrative action is taken in the light of the universal fellowship and the divine

		The brethren at Bethesda chapel, Bristol, in 1848 did not recognise that saints generally were as definitely committed to the refusal of evil which had come to light at Plymouth as were those who had the immediate responsibility of dealing with it.<a name=236:2></a> They held that a judgment of evil in Plymouth did not necessarily bind other assemblies; each assembly must judge for itself, or not judge at all, if it thought best to be neutral!<a name=236:3></a> This was clearly to make the assemblies independent units, and this principle is still maintained by those known as Open Brethren.<a name=236:4></a> What was judged at Plymouth was a clericalism which would have set aside all that the Spirit of God was recovering as to the truth of the assembly.<a name=236:5></a> Later it was found that along with this grave error there was the propagation of most serious evil teaching as to the Person of Christ.<a name=236:6></a> The latter was professedly judged at Bethesda <i>after</i> division had been caused by the refusal to judge it, but the principle of independency (which had left it an open question whether it should be judged or not) was never judged as evil, but is still maintained.<a name=236:7></a>

		The second part of your question, in which you ask, "Seeing there are so many different companies of 'Exclusives', how can one know for certain which is the true expression of the one body?<a name=236:8></a>" is more difficult to answer.<a name=236:9></a> To begin with, I doubt whether the Lord would have us to look for a company which should be the true expression of the one body.<a name=236:10></a> I think this would be too pretentious a ground to take in the midst of all the confusion of these last days.<a name=236:11></a> I believe the Lord would have His saints to recognise the truth of the one body, and every other part of the truth, and to seek to maintain consistency with it by following righteousness, faith, love, peace, and that in so doing there will be found a divine path of separation

		To find the company which has the Lord's approval and presence is a matter which involves not only the truth and principles which have been in question in each case, but also where the different companies stand spiritually at the present time.<a name=237:3></a> I would not care to attempt to prove that one certain company was right.<a name=237:4></a> It is largely a matter of spiritual indications which the Lord will undoubtedly afford to any who only desire His mind.<a name=237:5></a> To follow the man with a pitcher of water is a good guide.<a name=237:6></a> Look out for a living and spiritual ministry of Christ, and for purification from the influences of the world.<a name=237:7></a> But this calls for spirituality of discernment which can only be acquired by nearness to the Lord.<a name=237:8></a> So that we cannot look for certain guidance apart from our own personal communion with the Lord.<a name=237:9></a> For, after all, it is a question of where the Lord is, and of where souls are truly gathered to His name.<a name=237:10></a> And this, as I think you will understand, can only be appreciated in a spiritual way.<a name=237:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As a matter of history each breach amongst brethren which has resulted in permanent separation has been caused either by the attempt to introduce principles or teachings which were contrary to the truth, or by the refusal to accept light which the Lord was giving and which could be substantiated by Scripture.<a name=237:12></a> These things speak indeed of human failure, but they have been permitted as an exercise for faith; they cannot now be ignored, and therefore they cast every enquiring heart very much on the Lord, who does not fail those who wait on Him.<a name=237:13></a>

		May it be ours to pay diligent heed, until the Lord comes, to His word, "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies", so that every feature of the truth of the assembly may be found livingly in expression at that moment.<a name=238:7></a> The Lord says to the assembly in Philadelphia, "I come quickly: hold fast what thou hast, that no one take thy crown".<a name=238:8></a>
