		CHRISTIANITY AS CHARACTERISED BY MYSTERY (1)

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13:1">Matthew  13:1</a> -- 12, 24 -- 52
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=1:1></a>G.<a name=1:2></a> It is clear from this chapter that the thought of Mystery enters into Christianity, the Lord saying to His disciples that it was given to them to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but to others it was not given.<a name=1:3></a> There is a certain element of what is judicial in the blinding of the eyes of those who reject the testimony, so that divine things are hidden from them, but to those who are subject to the Lord, and truly disciples, the things of God are presented in a way that is comprehensible to them, but not to others.<a name=1:4></a> That really involves the Spirit, so the Lord said, speaking of the Spirit, that He would beg the Father and He would give us another Comforter, "that he may be with you for ever, the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not see him nor know him; but ye know him, for he abides with you, and shall be in you.<a name=1:5></a>" <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:16">John  14:16</a>, 17.<a name=1:6></a> So that the presence of the Spirit involves that there are certain things known to believers which are entirely unknown, and impossible of being known, to others.<a name=1:7></a> That brings in the thought of mystery as properly belonging to the saints, something that we should particularly cherish, that it is given to us to be initiated into the thoughts of God which are hidden from men in general.<a name=1:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13">Matthew  13</a>presents things first of all from the standpoint that, if there is to be anything for God, there must be a divine sowing, as in the parable of the sower, but even that brings to light that there are certain adverse influences, the wicked one catching away the seed sown by the wayside, and tribulation and persecution, and thorns, cares of life and so on.<a name=1:9></a> Then there are the six subsequent parables, which are definitely

	<div class="paragraph">
		called similitudes of the kingdom, divided into two threes, the first three giving the position of things publicly, and being intended to open our eyes as to the way that Satan is acting in opposition to what is of God.<a name=2:1></a> The last three give us what is really of God and are intended to give us to understand the true features of it, and I think as the Lord may help us we shall see that the features which are found in the first three similitudes of the kingdom all find their answer in the last three.<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.A.<a name=2:3></a>K.<a name=2:4></a> Does the apprehension of the element of mystery, as you are calling attention to it, as laid hold of by us in the power of the Spirit, greatly help us practically in realising the true greatness of what Christianity is, because all that is connected with it outwardly, and particularly the position of reproach in which we are, is rather small and insignificant?<a name=2:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=2:6></a>G.<a name=2:7></a> Yes, I think that, and therefore it is of particular value for all of us to get a sense that to us it is given to know divine mysteries.<a name=2:8></a> It sets us apart from the whole course and outlook of this world and gives us the consciousness that we have part in and entrance into a system of things of God that the world has no part in and cannot possibly apprehend at all.<a name=2:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.W.<a name=2:10></a>H.<a name=2:11></a> Does the matter of doing the will of His Father enter into the side of understanding the <i>you</i> that you have referred to?<a name=2:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=2:13></a>G.<a name=2:14></a> You are referring to the end of chapter 12.<a name=2:15></a> Yes, I think that greatly helps, that the Lord repudiates His brother and sister and mother; that is, His brethren after the flesh, and indicates that He recognises and identifies with Himself those who do the will of His Father who is in the heavens.<a name=2:16></a> Those certainly become the disciples; in fact, they were the disciples.<a name=2:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.E.<a name=2:18></a> Is there a general correspondence between the scope of things covered in this chapter and the letters

	<div class="paragraph">
		addressed by the Lord to the seven assemblies in Revelation chapters 2 and 3?<a name=3:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=3:2></a>G.<a name=3:3></a> I think there is, but would you say a little more what is in your mind?<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.E.<a name=3:5></a> I was thinking of what was inaugurated originally, and then the finish of things.<a name=3:6></a> What is of God carries through, does it not?<a name=3:7></a> I was thinking of the public side in Laodicea, but the vital side of things in Philadelphia answering somewhat to the last three similitudes.<a name=3:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=3:9></a>G.<a name=3:10></a> I think that entirely.<a name=3:11></a> I believe it is of great importance to be given to see how God views things as they are on the earth at the present time in Christendom.<a name=3:12></a> The kingdom of the heavens, I take it, specially refers to Christendom; that is, that part of the earth which publicly acknowledges the name of the Lord Jesus; but these parables will help us to see that the public condition of things is the result of Satan's work, so the true character of it is exposed to us in order that we should not be deceived by it.<a name=3:13></a> On the other hand, the last three parables will show us what is vital and precious in the sight of God, and one thing that will be noticed in relation to the treasure as it appears in the first of the three last similitudes, is that the character of being hidden is impressed upon it.<a name=3:14></a> The treasure is found hidden in the field and when the man finds it he hides it; that is, the character of being hidden is particularly -- impressed, deliberately impressed upon what is really of God in the world, and it is a great safeguard to see that, because then we become content with the hidden position.<a name=3:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.M.<a name=3:16></a> Is there a militant aspect of the matter in the way the full position is secured in this element of mystery?<a name=3:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=3:18></a>G.<a name=3:19></a> What do you mean by militant?<a name=3:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.M.<a name=3:21></a> Well, it may not be active, but divinely the position is guarded, so that those who have no part

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		in it do not have a part in it; and yet it is open, as you have suggested, to those who are initiated and there is liberty to move as recognising that it is in mystery.<a name=4:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=4:2></a>G.<a name=4:3></a> Well, I think that is implicit in the presence of the Spirit, "whom the world cannot receive, because it does not see him nor know him," the Lord says.<a name=4:4></a> So that in that way, by the gift of the Spirit, the Lord introduces His own into the things of God and excludes those who have no part in them.<a name=4:5></a> It is very important, I think, to see that the Spirit of God involves ability, capacity to enter into the thoughts of God fully, and it also involves a deliberate exclusion of those who have not the Spirit; the mind of man cannot possibly compass divine things.<a name=4:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.C.<a name=4:7></a>B.<a name=4:8></a> Does it show how God is carrying things through while still allowing Satan's power to be active in certain directions?<a name=4:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=4:10></a>G.<a name=4:11></a> That is what I thought was one great value of these parables, and hence, if we take up the parable of the tares, what is clear is that an enemy is at work; the Lord definitely says so, and he is at work in introducing publicly those who have the appearance of the true thing, for the tares resemble the wheat in outward appearance, but actually they are sons of the wicked one.<a name=4:12></a> The word is to let them both grow together; that is, God is not intervening publicly to alter that position.<a name=4:13></a> Then in the next parable of the mustard seed, that which commenced in what was very small has now become outwardly very large, what we speak of as Christendom.<a name=4:14></a> It becomes such that the birds of heaven come and roost in its branches; that is, there is room in it for every kind of evil doctrine; the whole position, so to speak, being discredited, but that is the position publicly.<a name=4:15></a> Then finally in the parable of the leaven there is a certain element introduced into Christianity which pervades the whole
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		thing, and that, I believe, is that the first man, whom God has set aside judicially in the cross of Christ, has been re-introduced, so that what is of man instead of what is of Christ pervades Christianity in its public aspect.<a name=5:1></a> Those, I believe, are the three outstanding characteristics of those three parables, and I believe we shall see in the other three, although not necessarily in that order, that all these elements are met in the vital thing.<a name=5:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=5:3></a>B.<a name=5:4></a> I was wondering if the importance of the thought of what is to be known in mystery is not emphasised, seeing the enemy has his counterpart?<a name=5:5></a> In <a href="../bible/2Thessalonians.htm#2:7">2 Thessalonians  2:7</a> "the mystery of lawlessness already works," and in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#17">Revelation  17</a>the name in the forehead of the great harlot is "Mystery, great Babylon.<a name=5:6></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=5:7></a>G.<a name=5:8></a> I think it is important to see that, that there is mystery connected with what is evil, and these parables are intended to open our eyes to it.<a name=5:9></a> Evil is working systematically, but in such a way that the world does not recognise that it is evil, but the saints' eyes are to be opened to it, to see that God is Master of the situation and that in His own hidden way He is working among the saints the complete answer to all that Satan seeks to introduce.<a name=5:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.E.<a name=5:11></a> Would you say that these three elements or principles are working at the present time, the principle of admixture which is always foreign to the work of God, then the tendency to assume proportions never divinely intended, then the subtle, secret working of evil as seen in the leaven?<a name=5:12></a> Are we constantly facing these principles in assembly matters, assembly sorrows and so on?<a name=5:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=5:14></a>G.<a name=5:15></a> I am sure that is right, and I think it helps to see that in the divine thought of the assembly, these evil principles are completely renounced and the opposite to them is established.<a name=5:16></a> So that, for instance, it seems to me that the parable of the treasure hid in
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=6>[Page 6]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the field is the answer to the parable of the mustard seed; that is to say, in contrast to that which assumes great proportions, the saints understand that the divine idea is that what is of God should be hidden, and we accept that position that our life is hid with Christ in God.<a name=6:1></a> The affections of the saints are bound up with Christ, and He being hidden we are content to be hidden.<a name=6:2></a> Then the parable of the leaven finds its answer in the pearl, because the leaven is the reintroduction of the man whom God has set aside in the cross, whereas the beauty of the pearl is that the assembly is for one Man only, for Christ.<a name=6:3></a> "I have espoused you," the apostle says, "unto one man, to present you a chaste virgin to Christ," <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#11:2">2 Corinthians  11:2</a>, and as the affections of the saints are held by the one Man, they refuse the re-introduction of the other.<a name=6:4></a> Then finally, the parable of the tares finds its answer in the net, the last of the similitudes, because there is the principle of discrimination between good and evil in the assembly, "They .<a name=6:5></a>.<a name=6:6></a>.<a name=6:7></a> sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away," thus good and evil are to be separated.<a name=6:8></a> It is very important to see that in the assembly there is to be the complete answer to all these elements of evil introduced in the public systems.<a name=6:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.A.<a name=6:10></a>K.<a name=6:11></a> I was thinking that what was said might suggest that in the idea of the treasure our minds would be directed to Colossians, whereas in the similitude of the pearl, would we not have the great divine thought of the assembly as in Ephesians?<a name=6:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=6:13></a>G.<a name=6:14></a> I have no doubt that the treasure links on with Colossians, as you say, and the pearl is peculiarly the beauty of the assembly as wholly for Christ, so that is no doubt before us in Ephesians, and I believe works out in a practical way in the exercises of the testimony.<a name=6:15></a> So that Paul in the 2nd epistle
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=7>[Page 7]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		to the Corinthians insists on the fact that he had espoused them unto one Man.<a name=7:1></a> I believe that is wherein the beauty of the pearl lies; its oneness, undivided affection for Christ.<a name=7:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.L.<a name=7:3></a>H.<a name=7:4></a> Is there any significance in the fact that the first three parables are spoken by the sea, and the last three in the house?<a name=7:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=7:6></a>G.<a name=7:7></a> I think that is significant, because the first three are dealing with the public position, whereas the last three, as you say, are spoken in the house, and are the result of the disciples having come to Him and said, "Expound to us the parable of the darnel of the field.<a name=7:8></a>" The parables are intended to induce a spirit of enquiry with us and enquiry which would lead us to the Lord to ask Him in the house, so to speak; you might say when together in the assembly, when together as we are at the present time, or, of course, in private; the idea of the house being private in contrast to what is public.<a name=7:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.H.<a name=7:10></a>G.<a name=7:11></a> Is it in divine wisdom that these evil principles have been allowed to operate in their intensity at the present time to bring out the glorious lustre of the assembly?<a name=7:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=7:13></a>G.<a name=7:14></a> I think so, and to see that God is always victorious all along the line.<a name=7:15></a> Outwardly.<a name=7:16></a> Satan may appear to hold the position, but then as our eyes are opened to what is in mystery we see that God is working triumphantly all through, though in secret, and using the very presence of evil to develop what is of Himself.<a name=7:17></a> I mean as the saints see false elements in the church they repudiate them in faithfulness to Christ and to the truth, and that strengthens what is of God.<a name=7:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.M.<a name=7:19></a> Would it be right to say that if we only take account of the public position we will lose our way, we will not be able to find our bearings?<a name=7:20></a> We need some instruction as to the inside position; that is connected

		with the house.<a name=8:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=8:2></a>G.<a name=8:3></a> I am sure that is right, and hence the value of these parables, and the Lord's instruction that to us, to the disciples, it is given to know the mysteries.<a name=8:4></a> It says in <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#25">Proverbs  25</a>, "It is the glory of God to conceal a thing," verse 2.<a name=8:5></a> God loves to hide what He is doing because that shuts out man.<a name=8:6></a> But then it says that, "the glory of kings is to search out a thing.<a name=8:7></a>" The kings are the saints in their dignity and it is to our honour to search things out, that is, things ought not to remain a mystery to us but we ought to have understanding in regard to them.<a name=8:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		L.G.<a name=8:9></a>L.<a name=8:10></a> Is there a sense in which things need to be maintained in mystery as suggested in Hezekiah's action in regard of the enquiries of those from Babylon?<a name=8:11></a> He lost his power once he opened things out in a public way, so that there seems to be a necessity for things to be retained in a sense in a hidden way in the soul, rather than to be affected by what comes from the outside place.<a name=8:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=8:13></a>G.<a name=8:14></a> I believe the secret of retaining things in secret is our links with Christ; that is, our understanding that the assembly is bound up with Christ, as we were singing in our hymn.<a name=8:15></a> The more we get the sense that the assembly is for time and eternity bound up with Christ, as a wife is to her husband, the more we shall be prepared to accept a position of being hidden and being out of this world because that is in keeping with Christ's present position.<a name=8:16></a> He is out of sight as regards this world.<a name=8:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=8:18></a>T.<a name=8:19></a> Is all this we are speaking of together dependent upon the Spirit and our spirituality, and is it all covered in the expression, "God's dispensation which is in faith"?<a name=8:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=8:21></a>G.<a name=8:22></a> Yes indeed, the dispensation which is in faith.<a name=8:23></a> Quite so.<a name=8:24></a> It is in faith on the one hand, so that the angels spoke to the disciples as the Lord was taken

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=9:12></a>G.<a name=9:13></a> Yes, we have to leave things to the harvest so far as the public position is concerned, but privately we accept separation from evil, in faithfulness to the name of the Lord, and in that position the whole truth regarding the assembly in its proper features can be worked out.<a name=9:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=9:19></a>G.<a name=9:20></a> No, there is nothing more to come, and I believe what you say is right, as having the Spirit there is no reason why we should not enter intelligently and feelingly into all that God has prepared for those who love Him.<a name=9:21></a>

		A.J.<a name=10:5></a>G.<a name=10:6></a> I think because the state of things in Christendom publicly is so confusing, unless the matter is explained.<a name=10:7></a> Hence the Lord explained the parable of the sowing, that there could be nothing for God at all apart from divine sowing, but also that the sowing would be in the presence of all kinds of influences that would seek to counteract it.<a name=10:8></a> Then he explains also the first of the first three similitudes that, as we have been saying, we might be fully intelligent as to what it is that Satan is doing and has been doing publicly.<a name=10:9></a> But over against that, not to be over-occupied with the negative side of things, the Lord brings forward three similitudes to which we are intended to pay great attention, the treasure and the pearl and the net.<a name=10:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		E.A.<a name=10:11></a>K.<a name=10:12></a> Do we rely wholly upon the Spirit for the understanding of these three inside similitudes which have been so misapplied by the profession around for that very reason?<a name=10:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=10:14></a>G.<a name=10:15></a> Quite so.<a name=10:16></a> The profession around would make the leaven a good thing and refer to it as the influence of Christ spreading through the whole world and so on.<a name=10:17></a> That is obviously a misapplication of Scripture: "A little leaven leavens the whole lump," <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5:6">1 Corinthians  5:6</a>, the apostle says in the epistle to the Corinthians referring to the moral evil that was there, and "A little leaven leavens the whole lump," <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#5:9">Galatians  5:9</a>, he says to the Galatians, referring to the principle of legality that had come in in the churches in Galatia.<a name=10:18></a> It is quite clear that leaven in Scripture is an evil principle, not a good principle.<a name=10:19></a>

		A.J.<a name=11:6></a>G.<a name=11:7></a> I suppose the treasure refers to what there is of God, or rather what He has in mind to bring to light in the world, "a treasure hid in the field" which has to be brought to light.<a name=11:8></a> It has been helpfully connected with the passage in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:12">Genesis  2:12</a> which refers to the river Pison which surrounds a certain territory, and it says that the gold was there -- "the gold of that land is good; bdellium and onyx stone are there.<a name=11:9></a>" That is to say, the passage there refers to a certain territory in which there was treasure, what was of real value, so from that point of view the field was not necessarily the whole world, it is a more limited thought; it is the field in contrast to the city or town.<a name=11:10></a> We have to recognise that Paul in his labours was definitely directed not to go in one direction, eastward, and definitely directed westward in his activities.<a name=11:11></a> All that rather bears out the thought that in God's ways and His sovereignty what He is bringing to light as of Himself during this period of Christianity is found in one particular part of the earth.<a name=11:12></a>

		A.J.<a name=23:1></a>G.<a name=23:2></a> We were remarking this morning that the thought of mystery in divine things, as far as our entering into it is concerned, involves the presence of the Spirit, the Lord having told the disciples, "I will beg the Father, and he will give you another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever, the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not see him nor know him," <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:16">John  14:16</a> and 17.<a name=23:3></a> So that the coming in of the Spirit evidently involves, for those who have the Spirit, that they are set up in the possession of things that are entirely outside the range of this world.<a name=23:4></a> I think this passage in 1 Corinthians enlarges on that in that the apostle intimates that he had wisdom to speak of.<a name=23:5></a> He had just said that he renounced entirely man's wisdom, but the Corinthians were to understand he had wisdom to speak of.<a name=23:6></a> It was necessary, however, that there should be a certain state in the saints in order to receive it, and that state, alas, was lacking with the Corinthians.<a name=23:7></a> In writing to the Corinthians the apostle does not proceed to develop what it is he has to speak of, but just says sufficient to induce interest in these things on their part.<a name=23:8></a> He says, "we speak wisdom among the perfect," and then at the beginning of the third chapter he has to tell them they are far from being perfect in that they were babes, and hence the point in this passage in Corinthians I think is just to stimulate our interest in the hidden wisdom which Paul has to make known to us, and to make it perfectly clear that only in the Spirit can this hidden wisdom be entered upon.<a name=23:9></a> On the other hand, as we were saying this morning, it is to show its that there

		is no limit to what can be entered on in the Spirit.<a name=24:1></a> The Scripture says, "for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God," so that, no doubt, while the apostle had in his mind the mystery, he does not call it the mystery in Corinthians but simply says, "But we speak God's wisdom in a mystery, that hidden wisdom which God had predetermined before the ages for our glory.<a name=24:2></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then if one may just intimate what is in mind in the passage in Colossians, he definitely introduces 'the mystery' and introduces it as something that is extremely great, speaking of it as "the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations" then showing that his great exercise was that the saints should be knit together in love; for unless we are united in love, there is no power to enter upon the mystery however much we may think we understand it objectively.<a name=24:3></a> Then finally, he introduces what is the kernel of it, that is, in Christ "dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily," so that nothing outside of Christ is needed by the assembly.<a name=24:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=24:9></a>G.<a name=24:10></a> I would say that.<a name=24:11></a> I think the idea of <i>perfect</i> in Corinthians does not go so far as <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3">Philippians  3</a>where the apostle says that he does not regard himself as being yet perfect.<a name=24:12></a> I think in Corinthians what he has in mind is that we have come to recognise the import of the cross of Christ and are ourselves in accord with it.<a name=24:13></a> We recognise that man in flesh has been set aside judicially in the cross and that everything now for God in us is in the Spirit.<a name=24:14></a> It is only as the Spirit is thus recognised that the deep things of God can be taken up.<a name=24:15></a>

		A.J.<a name=25:4></a>G.<a name=25:5></a> Yes, everything in the way of subjective results in the saints is dependent on the Spirit.<a name=25:6></a> In Matthew, which has in mind the position publicly and dispensationally, it says, "one hundred, one sixty, and one thirty," chapter 13: 8, showing that there is decline and that the dispensation closes with what is outwardly very small.<a name=25:7></a> But in Mark the similar parable says, "one thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundred," chapter 4: 8.<a name=25:8></a> Mark being the servant's gospel and showing that the servant is to aim at a full measure of result.<a name=25:9></a> Then Luke in the corresponding parable says, "bore fruit a hundredfold," chapter 8: 8, which again would link with our own state of soul, "an honest and good heart, having heard the word keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience," verse 15.<a name=25:10></a> That is our side of the matter, not the servant's, that we on our part should not have anything less before us than the full measure of fruit.<a name=25:11></a>

		A.J.<a name=34:5></a>G.<a name=34:6></a> Exactly.<a name=34:7></a> It is also very important to see that when Christ became Man, God had in mind to secure man for His pleasure, not only in a mediatorial way to express Him towards the creation, but to secure man for His pleasure, and Christ as a Man becomes the standard of that, and that also is to find expression in His body, involving perfect response God-ward.<a name=34:8></a> Men are brought into sonship.<a name=34:9></a> A divine Person became Man and has taken up that relationship of sonship because that was in God's mind for men.<a name=34:10></a> Wisdom's delights were with the <i>sons</i> of men.<a name=34:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=35:9></a>G.<a name=35:10></a> I think it is extremely likely it was, because we are told the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet whose name was Saul, and later on he tells us that he told the Lord that, when the blood of His martyr Stephen was shed, he was there holding the clothes, so evidently the stoning of Stephen had made a great impression on Saul.<a name=35:11></a> I have no doubt the pricking of conscience were prompted by what he saw in Stephen.<a name=35:12></a>

		A.J.<a name=52:3></a>G.<a name=52:4></a> Well, it is because 'the Christ' is Christ personally viewed as the One who is to accomplish all God's will, and take His place as the Head of the system of glory and blessing which God has in mind to bring in.<a name=52:5></a> He is the antitype of Adam, set over all the works of God's hands, and in that position the woman is brought to the man.<a name=52:6></a> It is important to have that view of the Christ, to get an impression of the vast system of glory that God has before Him to bring in, in Christ as the Head of it, and it is that One who loved the assembly and has delivered Himself up for it.<a name=52:7></a>

		as Moses had the whole pattern of the tabernacle given to him in the mount, and laboured with that pattern in his mind, so Paul would have the mystery given to him, and then would labour among the saints with that pattern in mind.<a name=62:1></a> In chapter 5 we have what the assembly is to Christ specially emphasised, and the apostle at the end says, "This mystery is great, but I speak as to Christ, and as to the assembly.<a name=62:2></a>" We get the great love of Christ for the assembly, "as the Christ also loved the assembly, and has delivered himself up for it, in order that he might sanctify it, purifying it by the washing of water by the word, that he might present the assembly to himself glorious.<a name=62:3></a>" I think the idea of presenting to Himself involves that He has in mind a vessel that should correspond in every way with Himself, and therefore it fits in with what we have in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2">Genesis  2</a>, where, as the woman is brought to the man.<a name=62:4></a> Adam says, "This time it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh: this shall be called Woman, because this was taken out of a man," <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:24">Genesis  2:24</a>.<a name=62:5></a> Now he has something that exactly corresponds with him, though in feminine features.<a name=62:6></a>

		A.J.<a name=65:8></a>G.<a name=65:9></a> We are, but Adam speaking in that way shows how his feelings were moved as he saw the woman being brought to him; "This time," he says, evidently implying that he had looked for something that would correspond with himself before, and had not found it, but now this time his desires and affections were to be gratified as he saw the woman being brought to him.<a name=65:10></a> Hence I think we can rightly take that up in assembly, that the Lord finds great pleasure in the saints as they come under His notice, and additional pleasure not only because of what they are, but because they represent God's own consideration for Him; just as Rebekah brought to Isaac represents the consideration of the father for the son, because it was the father who set in motion that the servant should go and find a wife for his son Isaac.<a name=65:11></a>

		A.J.<a name=66:8></a>G.<a name=66:9></a> Well I think it is implied, because after speaking of these things, the Spirit through Paul says, "Because of this a man shall leave his father and mother, and shall be united to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh," so that I think the Spirit of God is really leading up to the thought of union, and it is entered into, so to speak, from Christ's own side; Rebekah is from the other side, the question is, "Wilt thou go with this man?<a name=66:10></a>" and she says, "I will go," <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24:58">Genesis  24:58</a>.<a name=66:11></a> And then it says, "she became his wife, and he loved her," <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24:67">Genesis  24:67</a>, so that the movement towards union is on Rebekah's side in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24">Genesis  24</a>, but in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2">Genesis  2</a>it seems to be from the side of the man, a man leaves his father and mother and cleaves to his wife, as though the Lord greatly rejoices in having this vessel secured for Him, that can now be united to Him, and derive from Him, and be moved under His impulse, in all that that will mean, both in the service of God and in the representation of God.<a name=66:12></a>

		The passage we commenced with in Romans speaks of the goodness and severity of God; at the present moment Israel is experiencing the severity of God and we Gentiles are experiencing the goodness of God; but there is a warning that we also shall be cut off if we do not abide in goodness, and that cutting off is very imminent.<a name=69:1></a> Apostasy is rapidly covering Christendom and that means that the Gentiles are no longer abiding in goodness, so that the moment of their cutting off and coming under abiding severity is close at hand.<a name=69:2></a> That will become the occasion for Israel to be taken up afresh; but what it is leading up to is that, whether it be Israel, or whether it be the nations as brought into blessing, all is to be in the sense of mercy.<a name=69:3></a> God has concluded all in unbelief that He might have mercy upon all.<a name=69:4></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe the more the Lord is opening up the higher levels of Christianity the more necessary it is to look to our foundations and roots.<a name=91:12></a> The apostle's prayer "that the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts, being rooted and founded in love," <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:17">Ephesians  3:17</a>, is stated where the heavenly side is stressed.<a name=91:13></a> It is most important to see that our foundations are stable, and they are only stable as governed by the knowledge of God.<a name=91:14></a> So I thought that, after what has been before us already, piety might be a profitable subject, especially as the thought of mystery is connected with it.<a name=91:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first epistle to Timothy presents the truth of the house of God, which does not refer merely to saints as assembled, for we are always the house of God on account of the fact that the Spirit is indwelling us.<a name=92:9></a> Our conduct in the house of God should be in keeping with the truth of the gospel, that the knowledge of God is there and He is the Saviour God.<a name=92:10></a> God is one; He is not one God to believers and another as presented to men.<a name=92:11></a> Our knowledge of God works out in this attitude of prayer for all men.<a name=92:12></a> As praying for all men we shall not have strong feelings of resentment against men.<a name=92:13></a> If people had the impression that we were praying for them constantly, it ought to affect them.<a name=92:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not here a question of praying for <i>the</i> king, but for whoever the king may be at the moment -- "kings and all that are in dignity" covering any form of government, for God uses government to keep lawlessness in check, therefore the saints should pray for it, and the more so as lawlessness increases.<a name=93:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I desire, dear brethren, to indicate what it is that God is working for at the present time, that is, the end to which He is working.<a name=123:2></a> The passage I have read in <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#25">Proverbs  25</a>is very applicable to the present time, for as you will notice, it says that "These are also proverbs of Solomon; which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah transcribed.<a name=123:3></a>" The days of Solomon were Israel's brightest days.<a name=123:4></a> In Solomon's day the house of God was built, the ark was brought to rest, the service of God was set up and was functioning, and the glory of God filled the house.<a name=123:5></a> It really typifies what was no doubt reached at Ephesus under the apostle's ministry; that is, the full thoughts of God in blessing had been made known and there is no doubt that at one time the assembly there entered into them and responded to them, but then when we come to the days of Hezekiah, things are very different.<a name=123:6></a> Between the days of Solomon and the days of Hezekiah, a great departure had come in.<a name=123:7></a> Ten out of the twelve tribes were irremediably lost in captivity in Assyria, and even the remaining two tribes had very largely turned away from God.<a name=123:8></a> Ahaz the king who preceded Hezekiah was probably, up to that time, the most wicked king that Judah had ever had.<a name=123:9></a> But in Hezekiah's day, a measure of recovery was granted.<a name=123:10></a> The house was cleansed and the service of God was re-established, and the passover, the feast of unleavened bread, was kept for seven days, and then for a further seven days.<a name=123:11></a> And it says there was joy in Israel such as had not been since the days of Solomon.<a name=123:12></a> So that Hezekiah's days represent, in picture, a recovery to the greatest levels of truth that were ever ministered to God's people, and in that way answer very much
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=124>[Page 124]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		to the days in which we find ourselves at the present time.<a name=124:1></a> For though it be in much outward weakness, as indeed the position under Hezekiah was as compared with that under Solomon, the fact remains that in the ways of God those of God's people who are available have been recovered and are being recovered to the most precious features of the truth that were ever made known by the apostles.<a name=124:2></a> And it was in the days of Hezekiah that these proverbs of Solomon were apparently brought to light and were transcribed so that they might be on permanent record, and hence they obviously have a particular application to us at the present time.<a name=124:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing that is said in these proverbs which the men of Hezekiah transcribed is that "It is the glory of God to conceal a thing.<a name=124:4></a>" It is most important, beloved brethren, that we should understand that, that God take pleasure in concealing what He is doing, because then we are content even if things outwardly appear to be very small and insignificant.<a name=124:5></a> "It is the glory of God to conceal a thing.<a name=124:6></a>" We were having before us yesterday that the idea of mystery enters into Christianity in a very marked way, and this is in accord with that idea, that it is God's glory to conceal a thing.<a name=124:7></a> The object in that is that God intends to keep His holy and precious things outside the range of the natural man.<a name=124:8></a> And so when the incarnation took place, perhaps the most marvellous event that has ever occurred in the history of this world, when He who is God became Man, it is marvellous the way that God concealed it.<a name=124:9></a> When Jesus was born, He was born in Bethlehem and laid in a manger: there was not room for Him and those that were with Him in the inn, and therefore He was laid in a manger.<a name=124:10></a> Very few had any idea of the immensity of what had taken place in that God had come into manhood.<a name=124:11></a> The immensity of that was entirely concealed from the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=125>[Page 125]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		knowledge of the natural man, and God works deliberately on those lines.<a name=125:1></a> You will remember that the angel notified what had taken place to the shepherds and the angel said, "today a Saviour has been born to you in David's city, who is Christ the Lord.<a name=125:2></a> And this is the sign to you: ye shall find <i>a</i> babe" (it should not read <i>the</i> babe), that is, the angel was not specifically directing their attention to the Person of the Lord Jesus though of course that was involved, but he said, "ye shall find <i>a</i> babe.<a name=125:3></a>" That was the nature of the sign God gave, "a babe, wrapped in swaddling-clothes, and lying in a manger.<a name=125:4></a>" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:11">Luke  2:11</a>, 12.<a name=125:5></a> It was as though when God intimated the greatest possible thing, that a Saviour had been born who should be Christ the Lord, the sign by which they were to be assured of it was not a sign that would appear to man, or that to the natural man would convey any idea that something of transcendent significance had taken place, but the sign was to be "<i>a</i> babe wrapped in swaddling-clothes, and lying in a manger.<a name=125:6></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I only mention that, beloved brethren, to enforce this statement, for it is God's glory to conceal a thing, and I think as we follow His ways we shall see that that principle always operates, that He always conceals what He is doing.<a name=125:7></a> When the Lord Jesus died, to outward appearance it was defeat, but then God intervened and raised Him from the dead, but He did not make a public display of the resurrection.<a name=125:8></a> The Lord Jesus was never seen as risen from the dead save by chosen witnesses; He was never seen by the world; and then similarly He was taken up into heaven.<a name=125:9></a> God did not make a public matter of it.<a name=125:10></a> He did not display it.<a name=125:11></a> It was just to a chosen few that the privilege was given of witnessing the Lord Jesus taken up into heaven, not that God has left Himself without witness to these great things, for the Holy Spirit has come down from heaven and has testified to the great fact
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=126>[Page 126]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		of the resurrection and exaltation of Christ, and the testimony of the Holy Spirit has spread throughout the whole world.<a name=126:1></a> But at the same time, God works in that way, for it is His glory to conceal a thing, and I venture to say without the least fear of it being inaccurate, that the world at large knows nothing whatever of what God is carrying on among the saints at the present time.<a name=126:2></a> But then, "the glory of kings is to search out a thing".<a name=126:3></a> Kings are the saints as marked by royal dignity, and it is our honour to search out a matter.<a name=126:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With that in mind, I seek to pursue this scripture in Proverbs and to link it up with the scriptures we have read in Ephesians and Philippians.<a name=126:5></a> As I was saying I wish to indicate by the Lord's help what it is that God is working to secure, and I think for the present purpose we may limit our consideration to what it says in verse 4, "there cometh forth a vessel for the refiner.<a name=126:6></a>" God is working to secure a vessel, a vessel which is to be produced as the result of a refining process which He is carrying on at the present time, but the great thought before the mind of God at the moment is <i>a vessel</i>.<a name=126:7></a> You remember when Peter was in Joppa he saw a vessel; he fell into a trance and saw a vessel as a great sheet being let down from heaven, held by the four corners and let down to where Peter was, and taken into heaven.<a name=126:8></a> What he saw was <i>a vessel</i>.<a name=126:9></a> God was making known to him that He had in mind to secure a vessel.<a name=126:10></a> The vessel is nothing less, I need hardly say, than the assembly, the assembly too as the body of Christ, a vessel which is intended to be a vessel of praise to God at the present time and throughout eternity, as it says in Ephesians, "to him" (that is, to God) "be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages.<a name=126:11></a>" I understand that means that the assembly is to be the vessel in which glory is to be ascribed to God unto
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=127>[Page 127]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the age of ages.<a name=127:1></a> That is to say, it is to be capable of unceasing praise to God throughout all generations of the age of ages.<a name=127:2></a> Now if it is to be capable of that, it is surely essential that we, as composing the assembly, should become instructed in the glory of God; it is not right that we should have limited thoughts as to God.<a name=127:3></a> We can never become fitted to ascribe glory to God worthy of His name if our thoughts as to God and His glory are limited.<a name=127:4></a> The glory of God, I understand, is the shining out of God in His love pre-eminently, for He is love, but also in His wisdom and in His power and in all that attaches to Him, if one might use the expression, which He uses as subservient to the working out of the thoughts of love.<a name=127:5></a> Our apprehension of this will enable us to ascribe glory to Him in a way that is worthy of His name.<a name=127:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With that in mind, Solomon in these Proverbs says, "The heavens for height, and the earth for depth.<a name=127:7></a>" That is what I wanted by the Lord's help to enlarge upon a little, because the intention is that we should become familiar with heights, as we sometimes sing, 'Heights of glory thou hast given'.<a name=127:8></a> And then we are also to become familiar with depth because God is glorified in the heights to which He can go in blessing, and He is also glorified in the depths to which His love can go in sacrifice in order to reach His end.<a name=127:9></a> We are to be balanced thus in the appreciation both of height and of depth.<a name=127:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The epistle to the Ephesians presents to us the thoughts both of height and of depth; it is largely occupied with the thought of height.<a name=127:11></a> It is written, as of course all the epistles are written, but in a sense I suppose the epistle to the Ephesians supremely so, from the standpoint of Christ being exalted.<a name=127:12></a> The apostle says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every

		spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ," chapter 1: 3.<a name=128:1></a> He did not say that until Christ had already come and had accomplished redemption and had gone to the right hand of God and the Holy Spirit had come down.<a name=128:2></a> That having taken place, the apostle was able by the Spirit to say that God "<i>has</i> blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ.<a name=128:3></a>" That is, all that God had in His mind in the way of blessing for the saints is now set forth in Christ as a Man in His presence in glory, and the Holy Spirit given to us links us up inseparably with Christ where He is, giving us in the Spirit to partake in His life, and giving us understanding of what is involved in the position which Christ fills as a Man in the presence of God, and giving us the ability to respond to it worthily.<a name=128:4></a> And so the apostle in thus speaking in Ephesians traces things back to their source, that God has "marked us out beforehand for adoption through Jesus Christ to Himself": He has done that.<a name=128:5></a> He has "chosen us" it says, "in him before the world's foundation".<a name=128:6></a> We are familiar with these things in the letter, beloved brethren, but I believe it is intended of God that we should sit down quietly in the presence of God and allow these thoughts to sink into our minds, just allow ourselves to become impressed with the fact that God did take account of us.<a name=128:7></a> He foreknew us before the foundation of the world: had us in mind personally before He founded the world.<a name=128:8></a> The thoughts of love were formed and then the founding of the world took place in due time in order that in the, world He might work out the thoughts of love that He had already formed.<a name=128:9></a> This had us in view, beloved brethren, as it had all the saints in view, not simply collectively but individually, everyone of us and all of us together, "chosen in him before the world's foundation, that we should he holy and blameless before him in love.<a name=128:10></a>" Then it says, "marked us out

		beforehand for adoption (or sonship) through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the <i>praise</i> of the glory of his grace.<a name=129:1></a>" The point in view in all this is not that we should be complacent in our blessing but that we should be vocal in God's praise.<a name=129:2></a> It is "to the praise of the glory of his grace"; the <i>glory</i> of it!<a name=129:3></a> How glorious God's grace is!<a name=129:4></a> And the saints are to he vocal in the praise of it.<a name=129:5></a> We are not to be dumb, we are not to be silent.<a name=129:6></a> The saints are laid hold of in order that they may be the vehicle of praise to the blessed God as appreciating the glory in which He is made known.<a name=129:7></a> And so it says, "to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he has taken us into favour in the Beloved.<a name=129:8></a>" I know nothing more affecting than that, beloved brethren, that there is at this present moment in the presence of God, the Beloved, our Lord Jesus Christ, marked out by that wonderful description, <i>the Beloved</i>; beloved in a most absolute way; beloved in His Person as the Son, and beloved on account of His moral worth as Man, the true antitype of David and of Solomon.<a name=129:9></a> David was loved on account of what he was, his name means 'beloved', and he was a man after God's own heart, he was loved on account of the moral worth that was there.<a name=129:10></a> Solomon was loved in sonship, he was the one of whom God said, "he shall be my son, and I will be his father," <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#22:10">1 Chronicles  22:10</a>; (see also <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#17:13">1 Chronicles  17:13</a>, where the truth is stated in the reverse order).<a name=129:11></a> Both these types of Christ find their fulfilment in Christ as He is now in the presence of God as <i>the Beloved</i>.<a name=129:12></a> And God has taken us into favour in the Beloved.<a name=129:13></a> That is, there is a settled position of love that has come in in Christ according to God's purpose and in that position every one of the saints is set.<a name=129:14></a> Who could have conceived it, dear brethren, but God?<a name=129:15></a> And God having conceived it, who could have brought it to pass save by way of a divine Person having

		Now these are some of the heights, dear brethren.<a name=130:2></a> It says, "The heavens for height.<a name=130:3></a>" We are to take account of heaven, Jesus is there, and as we take account of Jesus in heaven we begin to get an impression of the height, the great height of blessing and glory which the blessed God is capable of.<a name=130:4></a> We cannot give any explanation of it save that He is pleased to do it.<a name=130:5></a> It is a question of the good pleasure of His will.<a name=130:6></a> Not one of these statements in the first chapter of Ephesians is without importance, and we are to allow each one of them its place in our hearts.<a name=130:7></a> "According to the good pleasure of his will," that is to say, we are to be impressed with the sense that God is what He is, that He is love in a most absolute way, love working in wisdom, love working in power with infinite resource to accomplish its own thoughts, in order, dear brethren, that we should form part of the vessel which is to ascribe glory to God in a way that is worthy of Him throughout eternity.<a name=130:8></a>

		Then it goes on to say, "in whom (that is, in the Beloved) we have redemption <i>through his blood</i>".<a name=130:9></a> A wonderful thing that there should be an immediate reference to the blood of the Beloved, testifying how far in depth the Beloved has gone in order that God might give effect to the thoughts of love that He has formed.<a name=130:10></a> Apart from redemption, apart from the removing of all the disabilities that lay upon us, these thoughts that God had formed before the foundation of the world could never have been brought to pass, and who was there great enough to accomplish

		redemption save the very same One who is marked out here as the Beloved?<a name=131:1></a> And hence as soon as the height has been brought in, "taken us into favour in the Beloved", the Spirit of God gives us a touch in regard of depth in order that there might be a certain depth added to us, that there might be balance with us, that we might be affected by the sense that the Beloved has had to go into death in order that all God's thoughts might be made good in Him as gloriously risen from the dead and ascended into the presence of God.<a name=131:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And so it says, "the earth for depth".<a name=131:3></a> I shall refer again in a moment to the earth, but if we get height set out before our eyes in Christ in glory, we get depth presented to us in the distance to which Christ has gone in order that divine love might reach its end.<a name=131:4></a> And as I say, it is the heights that set forth the glory of divine love, in the heights to which it will go.<a name=131:5></a> Depth sets forth the glory of divine love in another aspect as to the lengths of sacrifice and suffering to which divine love has been capable of going.<a name=131:6></a> And then as we go on in the epistle to the Ephesians we find that God has not only brought us into a place of remarkable blessing, but it says also that in His grace He has abounded toward us "in all wisdom and intelligence, having made known to us the mystery of his will.<a name=131:7></a>" Now this is important, beloved brethren, because one feature of sonship (and sonship is for the pleasure of God; sonship is not primarily for us although we are brought into it and greatly blessed in it) is not only that the position should be filled out in the affections proper to sons but also that it should be filled out in the <i>intelligence</i> proper to sons.<a name=131:8></a> Every parent takes pleasure in children when they are young and in the simplicity and affection and attractiveness of children, but no parent wants his children to remain young.<a name=131:9></a> No parent would be satisfied to find his children grow

		I pass on to the end of chapter 1, it says, God has set Christ "at his right hand in the heavenlies, above every principality, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name named, not only in this age, but also in that to come; and has put all things under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the assembly, which is his body, the fulness of him who fills all in all.<a name=133:9></a>" I have been saying the assembly is to share with Christ, and here she is seen as having part with Him in His headship over all things.<a name=133:10></a> The headship of Christ over the world to come will be exercised by means of "the assembly, which is his body, the fulness of him who fills all in all.<a name=133:11></a>" The light of God and the influence of Christ will be diffused abroad through heaven and earth by means of the assembly, His body.<a name=133:12></a> I only ask you, dear brethren,

		Before I speak on the passage read in chapter 4, I just want also to refer to the passage in Philippians because that is another aspect of the heavens for height, and it refers to us individually.<a name=134:2></a> So far, I have been referring largely to the assembly, although sonship of course is something we are brought into individually.<a name=134:3></a> It is those who compose the assembly who are brought into sonship, but sonship in the main is that which attaches to each of us individually.<a name=134:4></a> But when we come to the epistle to the Philippians there also we are on individual lines although it refers again to the saints who compose the assembly.<a name=134:5></a> The apostle Paul, nearing the end of his days as he wrote the epistle, shows us that the one thing that was governing his mind was his desire to have Christ as His gain.<a name=134:6></a> It is a marvellous thing to see the great apostle, endowed as he was with extraordinary knowledge and extraordinary gift and devoted in service I suppose above any other, that as he is nearing the end of his days it is not his service that is occupying him, it is not his gift that is engaging him, but his one desire is to have Christ as his possession.<a name=134:7></a> He apprehends that he himself has been apprehended to be found in Christ; he remembers well what he was once, a blasphemer, a persecutor and injurious, an insolent overbearing man, a Hebrew of the Hebrews, a Pharisee of the Pharisees, and all that.<a name=134:8></a> Paul would understand all that he had been, but he understands that divine grace had taken him up to be found in Christ, not

		The book of Numbers is divided into three parts; the first ten chapters give us the people of God set together and moving together in the wilderness according to God's mind; it answers to the first epistle to the Corinthians, "the assembly of God which is in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, with all that in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both theirs and ours," chapter 1: 2.<a name=143:8></a> That is, the position in view is the people of God here in the presence of men as the assembly of God, and they are to maintain all that is due to

		Well now, this afternoon we are dealing with the first section of the book of Numbers, and as I was saying, on the first day of the first month of the second year the tabernacle was set up in the midst of Israel; it was anointed, and the service of God in it was instituted.<a name=144:5></a> That typifies the assembly.<a name=144:6></a> We must recognise, dear brethren, that the truth of the assembly as it was set up by the apostles, has been at one time entirely lost, but we are living in days in which God has recovered the truth; He intends that every feature of the truth should be livingly in expression among God's people, and hence it is for us to pay great attention to the truth of the assembly, because the assembly is <i>the</i> interest which God has provided for His people to be thoroughly committed to, throughout the <i>whole</i> of their life down here.<a name=144:7></a> And so one month afterwards (the tabernacle having been established and set up in the midst of the people, they could take account of the position, and that is what God would have us do) God calls upon Moses to take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel; it was the males of

		twenty years old and upward that were to be numbered.<a name=145:1></a> That does not mean that these matters of which we are speaking are limited to brothers, nor does it mean that no brother or sister is to take them up until he or she is literally twenty years of age.<a name=145:2></a> Far from it!<a name=145:3></a> The males in Scripture represent the side that speaks of responsibility and the readiness to accept responsibility, and the readiness, so to speak, to go to war, for what is contemplated in this chapter is a militant position, it is a question of the defence of the testimony, being ready to stand for it.<a name=145:4></a> Hence every sister as well as every brother is contemplated as ready to accept responsibility, to play her part, or play his part in the defence of the testimony; that is, in the maintenance, with the brethren, of conditions suited to God's dwelling place amongst us, being zealous to preserve it against every obtrusion of evil whatever form it might take.<a name=145:5></a> Twenty years old indicates just a certain measure of maturity, but not much so to speak; it is not an infantile age, obviously, nor is it exactly the age of full maturity.<a name=145:6></a> It means that God wants us from our earliest years.<a name=145:7></a> When we have passed the stage of babyhood, when we have passed the stage of childhood, God contemplates that we should be available to play our part in the defence and maintenance of the testimony here.<a name=145:8></a>

		And so Moses was told to number them, all that were able to go forth to war in Israel; it is a question of the defence of the testimony, and when I say the defence of the testimony, all that it really involves is maintaining what is due to the name of the Lord Jesus, what is pleasing to Him.<a name=145:9></a> If Satan gets in, if he seeks in some way to corrupt or mar the testimony, he does it by introducing among the saints something that is not according to the truth.<a name=145:10></a> It may be some false teaching, it may be some evil practice; but at any rate, it is something which is out of keeping with what is

		find the twelve tribes all allotted their place in relation to the tabernacle, and they are set in their places by God in four camps of three tribes each.<a name=150:1></a> But each tribe is allotted his own place, that is to say, to put it simply, beloved brethren, the saints in Melbourne have their place in the testimony, the saints in London have their place in the testimony, the saints in New York have their place in the testimony, and the saints in the smallest country place where there is the truth of the assembly in living expression, the saints there have their place in the testimony.<a name=150:2></a> It is a universal testimony, but at the same time each one has his own allotted place in it, and hence fellowship is universal, but the responsibilities apply particularly to a locality in which we are set.<a name=150:3></a> We cannot disclaim responsibility in regard of anything that happens in any part of the world, the fellowship is one, the truth is one, and therefore if there is an attack on the truth in any part of the world, all the saints ought to be concerned about it; they may not be able to do much about it if they are far from it, but they can go to God about it in prayer, they can take up the burdens of the testimony in that way.<a name=150:4></a> Paul said that the burden of all the assemblies came upon him <i>every</i> day.<a name=150:5></a> Every day, as he gave himself to prayer, he would go round the different assemblies in his thoughts, and the particular conditions that were found in each, and the particular exercises that they were facing, and he would take them all up before God in prayer.<a name=150:6></a> I do not say that we are all equal to that; I doubt if any of us is equal to it in the same measure the apostle Paul was, only it shows what is open to us, and Paul in being marked by that kind of exercise was just the reflection of our Lord Jesus Christ on high, for our great High Priest on high bears on the breastplate all the local companies before God, in relation to the exercises that they are carrying.<a name=150:7></a> You remember it says that on the breastplate

		Well now, I pass on to <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#5">Numbers  5</a>, in order to speak very briefly of a most important matter, and that is that evil is not to be tolerated in the house of God, it is not to be tolerated in the local assembly.<a name=151:11></a> The word to Moses was, "Command the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp every leper, and every

		one that hath an issue, and whosoever is defiled by a dead person: both male and female shall ye put out; outside the camp shall ye put them, that they defile not their camps, in the midst whereof I dwell.<a name=152:1></a>" I have no intention, dear brethren, of going into detail, I am just calling attention to the principle that evil is not to be allowed in the assembly of God, and the reason given for it is this, "in the midst whereof I dwell".<a name=152:2></a> God says, That is an important matter, that God dwells among His people, that is why evil is not to be allowed, because God <i>dwells</i> there.<a name=152:3></a> And hence, dear brethren, if evil asserts itself among the people of God, and has to be dealt with, it has to be dealt with in the fear of God.<a name=152:4></a> The conscience of every brother or sister should be exercised in relation to it, and it should result in self-judgment, not only in the judgment of the evil in another, but in the recognition, in the presence of God, that one's own heart is capable of it, and it may be that the particular thing finds an answer in one's own heart, and hence the very presence of evil in our midst, and it having to be dealt with, assembly-wise, has in view that we should all be brought into the presence of God.<a name=152:5></a> And as facing the matter before God, and only as judging ourselves in relation to it, is there any power in the true sense, to exclude the evil from our midst.<a name=152:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am not overlooking that in these days of brokenness, we have to move on the line of withdrawing from evil, as authorised by <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:19">2 Timothy  2:19</a>, rather than of putting away from our midst as indicated in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5">1 Corinthians  5</a>, because <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5">1 Corinthians  5</a>contemplates that the whole assembly is available for that, and that public power and authority remain as at the beginning.<a name=152:7></a> While, thank God, there may be saints moving together in a place as governed by the light of the assembly, we have to recognise that the state of things in Christendom is so complex, is so broken, that it

		which I have not yet spoken of.<a name=160:1></a> I read that verse because it shows that there are two positions in connection with the maintenance of the testimony in the wilderness, one is that of pitching by their standards, there is the stationary position; and the other is of movement; "so they encamped according to their standards, and so they journeyed".<a name=160:2></a> It is an important thing to see that the testimony of God is characteristically in movement.<a name=160:3></a> There are times when it is stationary; that has in mind the consolidation of the truth, but characteristically it is in movement.<a name=160:4></a> They moved when the cloud moved; the cloud signifies the presence of God with His people, the presence of the Spirit of God.<a name=160:5></a> From time to time there is a movement of the cloud, that takes form in the Lord presenting some fresh aspect of the truth.<a name=160:6></a> Some fresh aspect of the truth is brought forward authoritatively in ministry and when that takes place, the whole of the saints are called upon to move in relation to it.<a name=160:7></a> When the cloud moved, the whole of the tabernacle had to be taken down, every bit of it had to be taken down, and then it had to be carried until the cloud stopped, and then when the cloud stopped the whole thing had to be set up again.<a name=160:8></a> It was the same tabernacle and had to be set up again in the same way, but it was in a new setting.<a name=160:9></a> So it is, dear brethren, that as the Lord gives fresh accession of light, drawing attention to some feature of the truth which previously had not been apprehended, the intention is that all the saints have their spiritual ears open to it and should be prepared to adjust their thoughts in relation to it.<a name=160:10></a> It has a bearing on the truth of the assembly and the truth has to be taken up and if one may so say, rearranged in the light of the new position that has come about by the movement of the testimony.<a name=160:11></a> I trust, dear brethren, you will weigh this because there is nothing so sorrowful than to go to a place and find that the brethren

		Now I must close and refer briefly to the passage in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#10">Numbers  10</a>because this refers to the time when the testimony started in movement.<a name=161:5></a> It was the first journey from the mount of Sinai: they were just about to set forward in movement, that is to say, now the wilderness is coming into view as a place in which the testimony of God was to be carried notwithstanding any opposition they might encounter.<a name=161:6></a> It says "they set forward from the mountain of Jehovah and went three days' journey.<a name=161:7></a>" I think that means it is a full testimony to what the wilderness is.<a name=161:8></a> Two days would be witness to the fact, three days is complete witness to the fact; that is to say as committed to the testimony of God it is a proving of what the wilderness is.<a name=161:9></a> It says, "the ark of the covenant of Jehovah went before them in the three days' journey, to search out a resting-place for them," The ark moved of its own accord.<a name=161:10></a> If you read the earlier chapters of Numbers you will see that the normal position of the ark was not before the people, but in the midst of them.<a name=161:11></a> When the people moved, the normal position of the ark was to be in the midst of the people.<a name=161:12></a> The camp of Judah was to move first, and then the camp of Reuben and then the ark and then the camp of Ephraim and then the camp of Dan: that was the order; but here the ark moved forward of itself and went before the

	<div class="paragraph">
		It was in my mind to say a word in regard of the government of God, not only as against those who do evil, but more especially to emphasise that it is in favour of those who do well.<a name=164:1></a> Perhaps we do not always bear this in mind in speaking and thinking of the government of God.<a name=164:2></a> When we speak of the government of God, we have in mind that God is exercising control, although in an unseen way, over the earth, and has His eye upon every individual and particularly on His people as moving together, and even upon the nations.<a name=164:3></a> In <a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#1">Ezekiel  1</a>the prophet is given to see a vision, and a vision which conveys that in an indirect and unseen way God is exercising control over what is moving on the earth.<a name=164:4></a> The prophet sees, amongst other things, wheels within wheels; wheels whose rims are exceeding high and full of eyes, indicating that there is nothing that escapes the notice of God.<a name=164:5></a> Above that, he sees the expanse as a terrible crystal, as though to impress us with the thought that "God is light, and in him is no darkness at all," <a href="../bible/1John.htm#1:5">1 John  1:5</a>.<a name=164:6></a> The heavenly city will come forth clear as crystal, but Ezekiel speaks of the terrible crystal indicating that there is no darkness with God, everything is as clear as possible in His sight.<a name=164:7></a> All that is being done, whether by nations or by His people as moving together, is perfectly clear before Him as to its true character.<a name=164:8></a> Then above all that, he sees a throne and the appearance of a man upon it.<a name=164:9></a> We are reminded that the Lord Jesus is in supreme control, however much things happening in the world or even amongst ourselves at times might suggest otherwise.<a name=164:10></a> Faith recognises that the Lord Jesus is in supreme control and considering always for God,

		The thought of the government of God is a very salutary and sobering thought but an encouraging one if we are prepared to go on with what is good.<a name=165:2></a> The apostle says, "God is not mocked; for whatever a man shall sow, that also shall he reap," <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#6:7">Galatians  6:7</a>.<a name=165:3></a> That is, it is an invariable principle with God.<a name=165:4></a> It is part of His ways, and I would say that His ways do not interfere with His counsels of grace.<a name=165:5></a> He has indeed taken us up sovereignly in His love for the greatest conceivable thoughts of blessing, but the fact that we are blessed in Christ, and stand in the place of sons before Him, in no way exempts us from the operation of His governmental ways.<a name=165:6></a> We have to bear that in mind, and as doing so, we shall find we are helped, because that preserves us in the fear of God and preserves us from coming under influences that might otherwise prejudicially affect us.<a name=165:7></a> So it says, "whatever a man shall sow, that also shall he reap.<a name=165:8></a> For he that sows to his own flesh, shall reap corruption from the flesh," but then it says, "he that sows to the Spirit, from the Spirit shall reap eternal life," and that is rather the side which I wanted to stress.<a name=165:9></a> While there is the side of God's government which operates against what is evil, so that if I sow to my flesh I shall of the flesh reap corruption, what I desired to stress is that there is the side of God's government which is advantageous to me; if I sow to the Spirit I shall of the Spirit reap eternal life.<a name=165:10></a>

		I read the scripture in Galatians to draw attention to this great principle of God's government which is always operating in relation to each one of us individually, and it is well for us to face it, for we are either sowing to the flesh or sowing to the Spirit, and it is a question of the lines on which we are going to prosper spiritually.<a name=166:9></a> It says, "And Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year a hundredfold," <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#26:12">Genesis  26:12</a>.<a name=166:10></a> That is how God operates in blessing towards those who pay respect to this principle upon which blessing is enjoyed.<a name=166:11></a>

		The second book of Chronicles is remarkable in this way that it does not only record history, but constantly gives us the moral bearing of it, and frequently shows us how the government of God follows us even to our burial, for there is no book like it for recording the kind of burial certain persons had, and it will always be found to be in keeping with the course they had pursued, showing that the government of God will follow us even to our burial.<a name=169:1></a> In <a href="../bible/2Chronicles.htm#16">2 Chronicles  16</a>Asa is again threatened, and this time he does not turn to the Lord but turns to the king of Syria and at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa.<a name=169:2></a> This time it is a seer; in the previous chapter it is a prophet who came to him with the word of the Lord.<a name=169:3></a> The seer does not speak as having a word from the Lord to communicate to Asa but he speaks as one who sees things.<a name=169:4></a> We may see things as observing God's ways and understanding them, as it says at the end of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#107">Psalm  107</a>, "Whoso is wise, let him observe these things, and let them understand the loving-kindnesses of Jehovah.<a name=169:5></a>" Observation enters into spiritual things and ability, as observing God's ways, to bring home to people what the consequences are sure to be of a certain course they are on.<a name=169:6></a> The seer comes and says, "Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and hast not relied on Jehovah thy God, therefore has the army of the king of Syria escaped out of thy hand," <a href="../bible/2Chronicles.htm#16:7">2 Chronicles  16:7</a>.<a name=169:7></a> Then in verse 9, "For the eyes of Jehovah run to and fro through the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of those whose heart is perfect toward him," a remarkable statement.<a name=169:8></a> The seer, though having to reprove the king on account of his defection, brings forward the operations of God's government in favour of those whose heart is perfect towards Him.<a name=169:9></a> That is what he would stress, what he would leave with Asa as if to encourage him to get away from everything that is in the nature of departure from God, and

		I believe the incidents we have read in the first chapter of Judges are intended to show us the lines upon which we may take possession of our inheritance, and when I speak of our inheritance I mean all that God has prepared according to His purpose and in His love for those whom He has called.<a name=172:1></a> Then I think in the subsequent passages we have certain features that are intended to characterise us with a view to meeting anything that Satan would endeavour to introduce that would hinder the enjoyment of the inheritance or rob the people of God of it.<a name=172:2></a> When Joshua had died, unlike the position when Moses died, there was no leader already on the scene to take his place.<a name=172:3></a> When Moses was about to die he appealed to God to "set a man over the assembly, who may go out before them, and who may come in before them," <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#27:16">Numbers  27:16</a>, 17, and God indicated that Joshua, a man in whom was the Spirit, as He said, was to be leader in place of Moses.<a name=172:4></a> But when Joshua died no such leader was indicated, rather what God had in mind was that His people were to move together mutually.<a name=172:5></a> They ask who was to go up first, and Jehovah said, "Judah"; that is, the tribe of Judah, it was to be a collective movement, and then without any instruction from God Judah says to Simeon, "Come up with me into my lot .<a name=172:6></a>.<a name=172:7></a>.<a name=172:8></a> and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot," <a href="../bible/Judges.htm#1:3">Judges  1:3</a>.<a name=172:9></a> So there is at once brought under notice this great thought of brotherly love, of being together in the things of God, which is a most important matter if we are to take possession and to enjoy the inheritance, because God's thoughts involve His saints all together.<a name=172:10></a>

		I desire to speak of the Son of man as He is presented in these scriptures in John's gospel.<a name=186:1></a> They are not the only passages in the gospel in which He is thus presented.<a name=186:2></a> There is, for instance, one in chapter 5 where we are told that the Father "has given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is Son of man," verse 27, a remarkable statement showing that God is infinitely fair and intends that His judgment should be seen to be so.<a name=186:3></a> So that men will be judged by a Man whose glory it is that He gave Himself a ransom for all, as the Lord says, "The Son of man did not come to be ministered to, but to minister, and give his life a ransom for many," <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#10:45">Mark  10:45</a>.<a name=186:4></a> So that as men are judged, as it says in Revelation, according to their works, they will be judged by One who at all cost to Himself provided a means by which they might have been released from the guilt attaching to them and from the sinful condition in which they were, and hence the judgment will be manifested to be absolutely fair; not a single word will be able to be said against it, but I do not dwell on that, I wish to concentrate on these passages.<a name=186:5></a>

		The Son of man is a subject with which Nathanael, who is introduced to us in the first passage I have read, would be familiar, for we have in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>, the well known reference to the Son of man.<a name=186:6></a> The Psalm starts with "Jehovah our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!<a name=186:7></a> who has set thy majesty above the heavens.<a name=186:8></a>" It was anticipatively directing the attention of faith to Him who has gone up far above all heavens; God has established His glory above the heavens, and the Psalm goes on to speak of the Son of man, saying, "What is man," (i.<a name=186:9></a>e.<a name=186:10></a> Enosh,

		work in Galatia was a legal element seeking to bring the saints of God under the power of the law and requiring that they should be circumcised, and the apostle meeting it goes back to the history of Abraham.<a name=202:1></a> Abraham lived, as he says, 430 years before the law was given, and God's relations with Abraham were not on the basis of law but on the basis of what God was pleased sovereignly to promise.<a name=202:2></a> So the history of Abraham commences with God calling him to leave his kindred and his country and his father's house and to go to a land that He should show him.<a name=202:3></a> He called him to a path of faith; it was to blessing, but blessing which had not as yet been defined in its full character.<a name=202:4></a> He was to move out in obedience and the word to him was that in him all the nations of the earth should be blessed; that is, God was establishing the principle that His thoughts of blessing to go out to all the nations would be on the principle of the obedience of faith, the blessing depending, not on those who were called, but on God Himself.<a name=202:5></a> So the apostle laboured to establish this.<a name=202:6></a> He says in <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3">Galatians  3</a>, "Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness," verse 6; we have that in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#15">Genesis  15</a>.<a name=202:7></a> God led out Abraham, who at that time had no seed, and directed his view to the stars of the heaven and said to him, "So shall thy seed be!<a name=202:8></a>" verse 5.<a name=202:9></a> It looked impossible so far as natural calculations were concerned, but "Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.<a name=202:10></a>" Now we have all commenced on that line, dear brethren, we have believed God.<a name=202:11></a> I am not referring, of course, to what precedes that, new birth, the work of God in us, but I am commencing from our own intelligent history in relation to these things, that we have begun there, we have believed God.<a name=202:12></a> We have believed on Him "who has raised from among the dead Jesus our Lord, who has been delivered for our offences and has been

		Before we proceed further, I would like to refer to the passage in Genesis that I read, because Abraham having believed God and it having been accounted to him for righteousness, and God having promised to give him the land to inherit it, Abraham wants to know how he shall know that he will possess it.<a name=203:11></a> Now that was not displeasing to God, that was not doubting His word.<a name=203:12></a> Abraham wanted to be assured in himself of the reality of the things which God had promised him, and God would have us all assured in ourselves.<a name=203:13></a> That is to say, on the one hand there is such a thing as the word of God which we believe, we commit ourselves to it; it is a question of believing

		When we come to the second point I had in mind, it is what is opened before us in the beginning of chapter 4 and that is, the character of blessing.<a name=208:3></a> The glad tidings is a gospel of blessing.<a name=208:4></a> "In thee" -- that is, in Abraham, on the principle of faith, for Abraham stands for the principle of faith, that it might be by grace -- "all the nations shall he blessed," <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3:8">Galatians  3:8</a>.<a name=208:5></a> But now, when we come to the character of the blessing, that brings in the thought of the son.<a name=208:6></a> You remember that as the history of Abraham developed, God promised him that he should have a son, and in due course, the son was born and he was named Isaac which means laughter; and Sarah said, "God has made me laugh," <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#21:6">Genesis  21:6</a>, that is, it refers to exuberance of spiritual joy.<a name=208:7></a> The name Isaac conveys that it was not a laugh of unbelief.<a name=208:8></a> Sarah had laughed in unbelief before and God had rebuked her for it, but now the son was given, the son was born, and he is named Isaac, and Sarah said, "God has made me laugh.<a name=208:9></a>" When he was weaned Abraham made a <i>great</i> feast.<a name=208:10></a> I believe it is possibly that incident to which the Lord refers when He said in <a href="../bible/John.htm#8">John  8</a>, "Abraham exulted in that he should see my day and he saw and rejoiced," verse 56.<a name=208:11></a> Abraham made a great fest, the son had now come into view and he was weaned, that is, he was standing out by himself, so to speak.<a name=208:12></a>.<a name=208:13></a> There he was, born according to promise; it was not anything that Abraham could produce, it was simply what God had brought in of His own free will.<a name=208:14></a> So we have in chapter 4, "when the fulness of the time was come; God sent forth his Son, come of woman, come under law, that he might redeem those

		That leads me to the third point I had in mind, and that is the substantiality of the blessing.<a name=210:8></a> That is a most important thing, and that lies in the Spirit.<a name=210:9></a> That is, these things are not only a matter of light, of what God has in mind for us, that is what is set out in the glad tidings, but the scripture goes on to say, "But because ye are sons, God has sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father," <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:6">Galatians  4:6</a>.<a name=210:10></a> That brings in the idea of substantiality; that is, things can be substantial, they can be real, they can be known in enjoyment in the power of the Holy Spirit which God has given us, the Spirit of His Son.<a name=210:11></a> It is a question of how to fill out the position.<a name=210:12></a> The Spirit of God's Son cries, "Abba, Father.<a name=210:13></a>" Could there be anything more attractive, could there be anything more pleasing to the heart of God than that we should be able to speak to Him with the same holy feelings of affection as were expressed by our Lord

		Now the last thing one has in mind to speak of is the liberating power of the gospel, and that flows out of what we have been speaking of, for the position of sons necessarily involves a position of liberty.<a name=211:9></a> There is no bondage connected with the thought of a son; you remember the Lord says in <a href="../bible/John.htm#8">John  8</a>, "the bondman abides not in the house for ever: the son

		Well now, in the verse we read in chapter 5, the apostle brings in the thought of Hagar and mentions her in contrast to what we belong to.<a name=212:7></a> Hagar represents a system of religious bondage; he says it finds its counterpart in Jerusalem which now is, and I think there is no doubt, if the apostle were alive today, he would say it finds its counterpart in Christendom.<a name=212:8></a> I do not think there is any question about that.<a name=212:9></a> It found its counterpart in the apostle's day in the Jerusalem that then was, the earthly Jerusalem, which he says was in bondage with its children, and it certainly finds its counterpart today in all that is religious in Christendom around us.<a name=212:10></a> But, he says, "Jerusalem above is free; which is our mother," verse 26, that is, the assembly, Jerusalem, is our centre, the assembly is our centre, it is God's centre, too, and it is above; that does not mean in heaven, it means it is morally lifted above the level of all that is legal and all that marks earthly, worldly religion, it is entirely lifted above the level of it.<a name=212:11></a> The secret of that is that it is characterised by sonship, the assembly is composed of those who are sons and all those who compose it are sons, there is no other character of blessing, the glad tidings of today as preached since

		In closing, I just refer to those two verses which I read at the end of chapter 5, because it may be that they point out what is the secret of any lack of liberty there may be with any one of us.<a name=214:4></a> The apostle says, "they that are of the Christ have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts," verse 24.<a name=214:5></a> It is a remarkable expression that we have <i>done</i> it.<a name=214:6></a> I wonder whether we understand what we have done, and whether we have really done it intelligently in our souls; whether we have crucified the flesh with its affections and lusts, because Christ on whom we have believed, who has been presented as an object of faith to us, is presented to us as One who has reached the position in which we have believed in Him by way of the cross.<a name=214:7></a> He could not be presented as an object of faith in the glad tidings until after the cross was an accomplished fact, and the cross means, as we were saying earlier, that sin in the flesh has been condemned and flesh has been crucified; the history of man in flesh has been ended judicially in a way that expressed God's abhorrence of it.<a name=214:8></a> His judgment of it was that it was only fit for condemnation in the most ignominious way.<a name=214:9></a> The cross was that, the expression of God's judgment of man in flesh.<a name=214:10></a> And now, as we believe in Christ, dear brethren, we have to believe in One who has been crucified, that is, we have to accept that truth that one order of man has been crucified, and we accept it, we take it home to ourselves that we have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts.<a name=214:11></a> I

		ask again, have we done it, dear brethren?<a name=215:1></a> In one sense we have done it in believing in Christ, but it is a question of our becoming intelligent as to what we have done, and of doing it feelingly, intelligently, in the power of the Holy Spirit, for the Spirit who is given to us is always faithful to Christ and always faithful to His cross.<a name=215:2></a> So it says, "they that are of the Christ have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts.<a name=215:3></a> If we live by the Spirit, let us walk also by the Spirit.<a name=215:4></a>" That is to say, we live in the Spirit, our life is life in Christ Jesus, and the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus is what is to regulate us.<a name=215:5></a> Let us walk in the Spirit.<a name=215:6></a> If we live in the Spirit, let us walk in it.<a name=215:7></a> The Spirit is given us as power for life and for walk.<a name=215:8></a> You will find Romans is full of what the Holy Spirit is to those who have believed.<a name=215:9></a> It says, "If we live by the Spirit, let us walk also by the Spirit.<a name=215:10></a>" I believe those two verses which I have just referred to may touch the secret of any lack of liberty there may be amongst us, and I urge upon one's brethren, as one would continually on oneself, to see to it that we are moving on the lines in which liberty in the Spirit may be enjoyed, so that we may be in the full possession of what God has given us in the glad tidings, and in result be fully for the pleasure of the blessed God.<a name=215:11></a>

		SPIRITUAL JUDGMENT AS MAKING FOR OUR PRESERVATION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#7:15">1 Samuel  7:15</a> -- 17
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I desire to say a word as to the feature of spiritual judgment which is to be constantly in exercise amongst us both individually and collectively.<a name=216:1></a> It is intended to preserve us as going on in the things of God.<a name=216:2></a> The early part of this chapter takes account of a state of departure among God's people, but also of recovery, so that .<a name=216:3></a>it says they put away their idols and served Jehovah only, and then God came in for them, granting a signal deliverance.<a name=216:4></a> But now this paragraph I have read comes in following on that, as if the Spirit of God would emphasise that there is something needed if we are to be preserved in the gain of what God has graciously recovered to us.<a name=216:5></a> One great feature that makes for our spiritual preservation is the maintenance of this element of spiritual judgment, for judgment is the application of divine principles or the truth of God to particular matters.<a name=216:6></a> Righteousness and judgment, it says, are the foundation of God's throne (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#89:14">Psalm  89:14</a>); righteousness being the governing principle, that is, what is right before God, and judgment being the application of that principle to particular matters.<a name=216:7></a> And hence it is important that we should all cultivate the faculty of judgment.<a name=216:8></a> We often speak of self-judgment, which is a very necessary matter, but the element of judgment, of particular matters should always be in exercise by us, and having the Spirit of God we are capable of it, for He becomes in us a spirit of judgment.<a name=216:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It says that Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.<a name=216:10></a> He maintained the exercise of this element all the days of his life, and in a systematic way, going round, as it says, in a circuit.<a name=216:11></a> He went from year to year in a circuit, to Bethel and Gilgal and Mizpah.<a name=216:12></a>

		and judged Israel in all those places.<a name=217:1></a> That would convey that what those places stand for was brought to bear continually upon the people of God, in their own practical every-day matters.<a name=217:2></a> What Bethel stands for was brought to bear upon them, and what Gilgal stands for, and what Mizpah stands for, was brought to bear upon them.<a name=217:3></a> It is important that we should thus realise that the Spirit of God has given us some indication of means which we may employ in the exercise of the faculty of spiritual judgment.<a name=217:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Bethel is of course the house of God, where God dwells.<a name=217:5></a> We are ourselves the house of God.<a name=217:6></a> We are always the house of God, in virtue of the presence of the Holy Spirit with us and in us; that is not simply when we are convened, but at all times.<a name=217:7></a> Christians having the Holy Spirit constitute the dwelling place of God, and hence that is to be borne in mind by us as to what befits the house of God.<a name=217:8></a> The Psalm so often quoted by us leaves us in no doubt as to that, "Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thy house, O Jehovah, for ever," <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#93:5">Psalm  93:5</a>.<a name=217:9></a> Whatever form the house of God has taken down the ages, whether the tabernacle or the temple or now the assembly, holiness has become it.<a name=217:10></a> "Thy testimonies are very sure.<a name=217:11></a>" Instances could be brought forward from the Scripture to show that God always insists on the maintenance of the holiness of His house, and hence that is a matter which we are to carry with us.<a name=217:12></a> The Spirit of God, God Himself dwelling by the Spirit in us, would constantly remind us of it.<a name=217:13></a> When thoughts arise in our hearts, contemplated actions, before the thought has been translated into action; let this element of judgment be brought to bear upon it, that God is dwelling in His house by the Spirit.<a name=217:14></a> Paul in writing to Timothy says, "These things I write to thee, hoping to come to thee more quickly; but if I delay, in order that thou mayest know how one ought to conduct oneself

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there was Gilgal.<a name=218:12></a> Gilgal is a reminder to us day by day of the circumcision of the Christ, and of our having been circumcised in the circumcision of the Christ.<a name=218:13></a> That is, it is a reminder to us of the death of Christ and of the only right answer to it in

		our own souls in the understanding that flesh must be cut off, that cutting off having actually taken place vicariously in the death of Christ.<a name=219:1></a> He assumed in grace flesh and blood condition in order that by His death the condition of sinful flesh in which we were involved might be ended, and, as appropriating the truth, we have to make sharp knives as it says in Joshua.<a name=219:2></a> That is, we have to be drastic in the power of the Holy Spirit in applying the truth of circumcision to ourselves.<a name=219:3></a> As the people of God did so, Jehovah said, "This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you," <a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#5:9">Joshua  5:9</a>.<a name=219:4></a> As long as any features of the flesh are in evidence and allowed amongst us, it is a reproach to us.<a name=219:5></a> We are carrying with us a taint of the world, a taint of that out of which we have been redeemed for the pleasure of God.<a name=219:6></a> It is for us to take up in our minds how blessedly the truth has been established for the pleasure of God in Christ by means of His death, as it says in the epistle to the Corinthians, "these things were some of you; but ye have been washed, but ye have been sanctified, but ye have been justified in the name of the Lord Jesus," <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#6:11">1 Corinthians  6:11</a>.<a name=219:7></a> That is the objective side of the truth that has come to pass for us in Christ, and we have appropriated it by faith, and it is accredited to us.<a name=219:8></a> But the scripture goes on to say, "And by the Spirit of our God.<a name=219:9></a>" That is, God contemplates that there should be the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=219:10></a> "Ye have been washed .<a name=219:11></a>.<a name=219:12></a>.<a name=219:13></a> and by the Spirit of our God"; it means in the power of the Spirit of our God, implying that, as the Spirit of God is given His place, there is a subjective answer in us to our position objectively, as having in Christ been washed and sanctified and justified.<a name=219:14></a> So, as I say, Samuel from year to year brought Gilgal to bear upon the people of God.<a name=219:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These are three important elements that come into this matter of spiritual judgment, as intended to be applied by us constantly with a view to our preservation, for, as was said in prayer, our God is a consuming fire.<a name=220:8></a> Everyone knows what his flesh is; as the Scripture says, "The heart is deceitful above all things, and incurable," <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#17:9">Jeremiah  17:9</a>; anyone who knows anything of having to do with God understands that, but there is the power to move in superiority to the flesh, and to be preserved in superiority to it in the Holy Spirit.<a name=220:9></a> The spiritual meaning of these particular features of Bethel, of Gilgal and of Mizpah is intended to be remembered by us as a means by which, with the Spirit's help, we may be preserved.<a name=220:10></a>

		We have been speaking together of the thought of sonship as the characteristic feature of Christianity according to God's mind, so that Peter confesses Jesus as the Christ, the Son of the living God, and then, when taken by the Lord Jesus on to the holy mount, the Father called Peter's attention to Christ, saying, "<i>This</i> is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight: hear him," <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#17:5">Matthew  17:5</a>.<a name=222:1></a> He would not allow any suggestion of something less to be put alongside of the thought of sonship.<a name=222:2></a> Peter had suggested three tabernacles, one for Christ and one for Moses and one for Elias, but as soon as the suggestion was made, the Father intervened in an adjusting way.<a name=222:3></a> Peter was to understand that there was no such thought in God's mind, He had brought in His best.<a name=222:4></a> Sonship, as set out to be learned in Christ, is God's thought for those whom He calls, and nothing secondary is to be put alongside of it.<a name=222:5></a> The Lord sought to establish Peter in the sense of it in saying, "Then are the sons free," and then telling him to take a piece of money and give to those who demanded it, saying, "take that and give it to them for me and thee," <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#17:27">Matthew  17:27</a>.<a name=222:6></a> It is a most remarkable thing that the Lord should say, "for me and thee".<a name=222:7></a> We are to learn the truth in Christ, "for me", and then learn to identify ourselves with Him in that which is set forth in Himself.<a name=222:8></a>

		I want, this evening, in calling attention to these scriptures, to show that on the side of our response our High Priest is the Son of God.<a name=222:9></a> The writer of the epistle to the Hebrews at the beginning of chapter 3 says, "Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus.<a name=222:10></a>" The Apostle is the One in whom God sets out His thoughts toward us, so

		in the first chapter God is speaking now in His Son.<a name=223:1></a> We learn what God's thoughts for us are in sonship in Christ.<a name=223:2></a> He has come in in order that they might be set out; He is thus the Apostle of Christianity, the authoritative exponent in Himself of what God's thoughts of blessing are for those whom He calls.<a name=223:3></a> He is also the High Priest of our confession; He is the One who in Himself sets out the answer to the way God is revealed, in perfect consistency with it, and He is equal to sustaining us in answer to the way in which God has come out.<a name=223:4></a> There is very little more said about the Apostle of our confession after the beginning of the epistle, but the greater part of it is taken up with the side of the High Priest, the One who represents God's people in His presence and who sustains them in moving in response to God.<a name=223:5></a> So, while in the first chapter <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>is quoted, "<i>Thou</i> art my Son: this day have <i>I</i> begotten thee," it is in connection with the Apostle; God brings in His Son and sets out His thoughts for us that they are nothing less than sonship.<a name=223:6></a> In <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#5">Hebrews  5</a>the same Psalm is quoted again, not now to bring in the thought of the Apostle, but in order to show that when God said, "<i>Thou</i> art my Son, <i>I</i> have today begotten thee," He marked Him out for priesthood, "And no one takes the honour to himself but as called by God, even as Aaron also.<a name=223:7></a> Thus the Christ has not glorified himself to be made a high priest; but he who had said to him, <i>Thou</i> art my Son, <i>I</i> have today begotten thee," verses 4, 5.<a name=223:8></a> I only bring that in in order to show the immensity of what is in view in this simple statement in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>, "Thou art my Son; <i>I</i> this day have begotten thee.<a name=223:9></a>" All Christianity is wrapped up in it.<a name=223:10></a> The Apostle of our confession is involved in it, the One who sets out God's thoughts in Christianity, and the High Priest of our confession is also involved in it.<a name=223:11></a> God takes up no less than His Son to represent

		Coming to the scripture with which we commenced reading, the writer says, "Having therefore a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God.<a name=224:2></a>" Hebrews is characterised by the constant allusions to <i>Jesus</i>; that is, the writer would fix our attention on the Person of Christ not primarily in any official view of Him, but in His personal attractiveness, the name by which He is known.<a name=224:3></a> But then He immediately adds to His personal name Jesus "the Son of God", and then that He has passed through the heavens, gone right through; however many heavens there are He has gone through them all into the immediate presence of God.<a name=224:4></a> Hebrews has often been called the epistle of the opened heavens and that is exactly what it is.<a name=224:5></a> The Spirit of God attracts us to the glorious position that Jesus is filling now; He has passed through the heavens; that is, He has gone right into the immediate presence of God and He is there as the Son of God, and as representative of us.<a name=224:6></a> The Representative of the saints is not only in the immediate presence of God, but He is there as His Son in all the affection and nearness and suitability that that involves.<a name=224:7></a>

		I have in mind to speak of the great responsibility that rests upon us to keep what has been committed to us.<a name=263:1></a> In <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1:14">2 Timothy  1:14</a> we read, "Keep, by the Holy Spirit which dwells in us, the good deposit entrusted.<a name=263:2></a>" The more the mind of God is being opened up to us, the greater our responsibility to keep it uncorrupted until the end.<a name=263:3></a> That is a most important matter, and it is well that we should be alive to the fact that we are in a world which is characterised by increasing evil of every kind.<a name=263:4></a> That is not merely incidental, but Satan uses it to endeavour to rob the saints of what God has given them in the way of light and privilege, and not only to rob the saints, but to overthrow if possible the testimony which God is set upon maintaining in this world.<a name=263:5></a> The testimony is a word which is often found in Scripture, and may be summed up in this, that God's will is going to prevail, and that what is of God is going to be established on the earth to the overthrow of all that is not of God.<a name=263:6></a> Conditions in the world would belie such a thought: there is nothing in the conditions in the world, either politically or socially or religiously, to suggest that any progress is being made in the overthrow of evil, and the establishment of what is of God.<a name=263:7></a> But the saints of God have light in their souls, given them by God, that Christ is already triumphant over all the powers of evil for He is risen from the dead and has gone to the right hand of God, and that He has gone to the dominant position which He is at present occupying in order to fill all things; the day of Christ, when that will be established and manifested, is about to come in.<a name=263:8></a> In the meantime, among the saints of God on earth and among them only,

	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe, dear brethren, the history of Samuel presents certain spiritual elements which are essential in any locality for the prosperity of the testimony there, and shows how they may develop from small beginnings.<a name=281:1></a> The elements that I refer to are first what is priestly, then secondly the prophetic word, thirdly power with God in prayer and calling on His name, fourthly the element of spiritual judgment, and then finally the power to bring Christ in so that he acquires the place among God's people that He should have.<a name=281:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think we can see that all these elements are of great value in any locality, and there is no reason why they should not be present, for the days in which Samuel is introduced were about as bad as they could be.<a name=281:3></a> Indeed, they are referred to at the end of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#78">Psalm  78</a>in terms that show that the conditions among God's people had at that time become as bad, as I have said, as they could be, but they afforded the background for God to intervene in His sovereignty to bring in David, and through him to establish all His thoughts concerning His people.<a name=281:4></a> But then, before he brought in David, there was this previous history having its rise in the exercises of a godly woman named Hannah.<a name=281:5></a> There is no reason why the spirit of Hannah should not be with us, for the conditions publicly in Christendom are morally the same as the conditions that obtained in Israel in Hannah's day.<a name=281:6></a> That is, that which claims publicly to be in the position of the priesthood is utterly corrupt, and so much evil and corruption of every kind are now connected with what claims to be divine service that it is utterly nauseous to Him, so that the Lord's word to Laodicea is, "I am about to

	<div class="paragraph">
		But it was in the presence of such conditions that Hannah had her exercises, her husband apparently satisfied to go on with what was formal; the yearly sacrifice was quite sufficient for him, so that he could hardly understand Hannah's exercise that she could be content with nothing less than a son.<a name=282:2></a> What God has in mind for His saints is that they should move before Him and serve Him in the character of sons, and Hannah desired a son.<a name=282:3></a> Elkanah said to Hannah, "Am not I better to thee than ten sons?<a name=282:4></a>" <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#1:8">1 Samuel  1:8</a>, but Hannah pursued her exercise and in due course God gave her the son that she had asked for, and he was named Samuel, which means, 'Asked for of God'.<a name=282:5></a> Now this is a most important matter for us to bear in mind, beloved brethren, and it is always open to us to ask of God.<a name=282:6></a> Samuel represents what is brought in on the basis of asking of God, so that whatever needs may disclose themselves in a locality, whatever falling short there may be in the actual answer to the truth, there is always open to us this avenue of asking of God.<a name=282:7></a> God loves to give in answer to requests, as the Lord said, "how much rather shall the Father who is of heaven give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?<a name=282:8></a>" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#11:13">Luke  11:13</a>.<a name=282:9></a> Hence Samuel represents what is brought in on the principle of one exercised soul having asked of God, having had discernment of conditions, and intelligence of what was needed to meet those conditions.<a name=282:10></a> It says of Samuel that he ministered before the Lord being a boy girded with a linen ephod; that is, he morally displaced the priesthood that was so corrupt.<a name=282:11></a> Officially he was not a priest, for

	<div class="paragraph">
		That is the first thing to be considered in any locality, what is priestly, what will minister to the pleasure of God, not doing it in a merely formal way, but as having the moral conditions that the service of God requires, because it says that Samuel was girded with an ephod of linen.<a name=283:3></a> That represents that the moral conditions suitable to the priesthood were found with Samuel, even though at this time he was but a boy.<a name=283:4></a> That is what God looks for in His people; it was being developed, though in but small measure as yet, and God could now set aside the official priesthood that was so corrupt and distasteful to Him.<a name=283:5></a> I believe it is always God's way that, if He is going to set something aside.<a name=283:6></a> He has already there in existence what is qualified to replace it.<a name=283:7></a> So you remember when the disciples spoke to the Lord about the temple and called His attention to the fine buildings, He told them, "not a stone shall be left upon a stone, which shall not be thrown down," <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#13:2">Mark  13:2</a>.<a name=283:8></a> The Lord had there the widow who had cast in her two mites into the treasury, and therefore that which was only formal could be set aside; what was pleasing to God and devoted to His service was already there in the person of the widow.<a name=283:9></a> That is always a principle with God, and I would urge upon the young brothers and sisters to start young in considering what is pleasing to God so as to develop in what is priestly.<a name=283:10></a> We can only develop what is priestly by being in the presence of God and being attentive to the Holy Spirit.<a name=283:11></a> It is only thus that we shall develop in what is priestly, but that is what counts above everything else in His testimony, and everything that is pleasing to God develops out of what is priestly.<a name=283:12></a> What Samuel was as a great prophet, what he was as a great intercessor and one who had

		power with God as calling on His name, and what he was as a great judge, all flow out of his beginnings in priestly activities.<a name=284:1></a> He was not a priest officially but he was one morally, and it is exactly the same today with the saints of God who give place to the Spirit of God; they are characteristically priestly, and displace all that is formal and official in the priesthood around us.<a name=284:2></a> God passes over all that, and will shortly set it aside completely, because He already has in its place that which pleases Him.<a name=284:3></a>

		So it says that Samuel's mother made him a little coat and brought it to him from year to year.<a name=284:4></a> How important this maternal element is in any company, the element that, as having already considered for God, will watch the growth of that which is young in the company.<a name=284:5></a> The suggestion is that there was normal gradual growth, and each year a fresh coat was needed, and it was the mother that brought it.<a name=284:6></a> It is most important that there should be this maternal watchfulness as to the spiritual growth of those who are younger, that there may be a steady development of what is priestly in the local company, because, I say again, what is priestly underlies everything else.<a name=284:7></a> There can be no power in the prophetic word, or with God in intercession, or in the spirit of judgment -- there can be no power in any of these directions, save as it finds its roots in what is priestly.<a name=284:8></a>

		Then in the end of the chapter Samuel comes before us as marked by spiritual judgment, a most important feature in the assembly.<a name=291:2></a> We are to judge angels, and the world, and in view of our judging the world, God allows all sorts of matters to arise in the history of the assembly; they arise in localities, and have to be dealt with in localities according to the spirit of judgment, that is, right judgment.<a name=291:3></a> Judge not according to sight; but judge righteous judgment," <a href="../bible/John.htm#7:24">John  7:24</a>.<a name=291:4></a> First of; all, before any judgment is pronounced on a matter, the correct facts have to be carefully ascertained and a thorough inquiry made as we see in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#13:14">Deuteronomy  13:14</a> and <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#17:4">Deuteronomy  17:4</a>: then it is a question of bringing to bear upon these facts principles that are according to God.<a name=291:5></a>

		In chapter 16, I think Samuel represents another element.<a name=292:18></a> I do not go into the detail of that chapter, but it is particularly occupied with a locality, that is, Bethlehem.<a name=292:19></a> It is in view of conditions pleasing to God being found in Bethlehem, Saul (that is, the first man at his best) had been rejected by God, and speaking typically, the point is that Christ is to take his place.<a name=292:20></a> David was to be anointed, the man of God's choice; that is, to put it simply, the first man is not to be in evidence in our locality.<a name=292:21></a> Christ is to be everything and in all.<a name=292:22></a> That is what God has in mind, and that is, what we should have in mind; we may say we are a long way from it, but let us keep the divine thought

		Samuel was to go to Bethel to anoint to Jehovah a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, to anoint the king He had provided.<a name=293:3></a> Samuel understands that if Saul is to be set aside, there is sure to be conflict.<a name=293:4></a> He says, "How shall I go?<a name=293:5></a> if Saul hear it, he will kill me," <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#16:2">1 Samuel  16:2</a>.<a name=293:6></a> If anything of the first man in any form has a place in any local company, and the Spirit of God is going to work with a view to displacing that and bringing Christ in, we may rest assured there will be conflict, and the point is how to go about it.<a name=293:7></a> It is like a general, considering the best mode of attack, how to achieve his end with the least possible loss; and Samuel said, "How shall I go?<a name=293:8></a> if Saul hear it, he will kill me.<a name=293:9></a>" God said to Samuel, "Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to Jehovah.<a name=293:10></a> And call Jesse to the sacrifice," chapter 16: 2, 3, and we find in verse 5 that when Samuel moves to Bethel, he says to the leaders that he has come peaceably.<a name=293:11></a> "I am come to sacrifice to Jehovah.<a name=293:12></a> Hallow yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice.<a name=293:13></a> And he hallowed Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.<a name=293:14></a>"

		The idea of sacrifice to Jehovah was to be set before the elders of Bethlehem.<a name=293:15></a> Every true believer would respond to the idea of considering for God, and providing conditions pleasing to God in his locality, and so Samuel was to come to Bethlehem with the object of providing conditions that were pleasing to God, that which God could take pleasure in, and all were to be drawn into it.<a name=293:16></a> Samuel would bring the elders in too, and Jesse and his sons; all were to be drawn into this matter of considering for God with just one object in view, that conditions pleasing to God should be brought in.<a name=293:17></a> That necessitates that Christ should be brought in.<a name=293:18></a> But then Samuel was also to take a heifer
