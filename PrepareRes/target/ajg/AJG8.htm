		A.J.<a name=1:1></a>G.<a name=1:2></a> I was thinking that this epistle stresses the great substantiality of Christianity, that it is a real and substantial thing, marked by life, so that it speaks of "the eternal life, which was with the Father, and has been manifested to us" and the epistle is written, as we know from the last chapter, that we might know that we have eternal life.<a name=1:3></a> What I think we shall find, as we proceed, is that the life that is known and enjoyed among the saints takes character from what God is in His nature, so that we are constantly challenged as we go through this epistle.<a name=1:4></a> Remarks occur in the epistle from time to time that are intended to 'pull us up', so to speak, and make us examine whether we are really in things or not, the Spirit of God insisting on the reality and substance of what we have come into, and that it is entirely of God.<a name=1:5></a> Another thing that the epistle is marked by, as is well known, is the way that the writer says "he" and "him" without specifying, in so many words, whether he is referring to Christ or to God.<a name=1:6></a> We are thus constantly impressed, in this epistle, with God, but God as known in Christ, and I think the fact that we are to arrive at the knowledge of God links on with eternal conditions, the epistle bringing in, for instance, the thought that we are abiding in God and God in us.<a name=1:7></a> I trust, therefore, that as we proceed we shall be helped to face the truth as to how far we are in the power of Christianity, and helped too in our knowledge of God and our entrance into what is eternal in character.<a name=1:8></a> That is what one has in mind in suggesting the epistle.<a name=1:9></a>

		the way the epistle opens, that which was heard and seen, contemplated, handled?<a name=2:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=2:2></a>G.<a name=2:3></a> Yes, the apostle refers to the life which had been before their eyes in the Person of Jesus, not as something that was theoretical or merely doctrinal, but something which they had seen and handled and contemplated.<a name=2:4></a> It was something very substantial, and we can see that John in his ministry leads up, in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21">Revelation  21</a>, to something extremely substantial formed in the saints.<a name=2:5></a> One refers, of course, to the city, where the dimensions of it are given -- "twelve thousand stadia: the length and the breadth and height" suggesting a cube of immense measurement, but immense content, immense substance, and that is what the Spirit of God is labouring to produce.<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.A.<a name=2:7></a>P.<a name=2:8></a> Is this a reference to Christ in His flesh and blood condition, or does it refer to Him in resurrection as He moved in and out among the disciples during the forty days?<a name=2:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=2:10></a>G.<a name=2:11></a> I think it includes both.<a name=2:12></a> It was what they apprehended in Christ in His movements amongst them, before He died, and what they saw in Him during the forty days.<a name=2:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.B.<a name=2:14></a>P.<a name=2:15></a> The footnote refers to <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24">Luke  24</a>.<a name=2:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=2:17></a>G.<a name=2:18></a> Yes, because there we get a specific example of that which was handled.<a name=2:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.C.<a name=2:20></a> Does not that scripture link up the two periods?<a name=2:21></a> The Lord says "I myself," it was the same One they had known in blood and flesh that they could then handle as risen?<a name=2:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=2:23></a>G.<a name=2:24></a> I think that helps.<a name=2:25></a> Of course, in taking account of the Lord in flesh and blood condition, before His death, other things were seen as well as eternal life; that is, we see the Lord in the position of testimony and conflict, but when He was risen from the dead, that is past and is no longer seen, and we can contemplate Him moving wholly in relation

		to that eternal life.<a name=3:1></a> At the same time, we might reverently say that what He was in testimony found its roots and its power in what He was with His Father, which is really the essence of this eternal life.<a name=3:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.H.<a name=3:3></a>H.<a name=3:4></a> Hence such an expression as in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#21">Luke  21</a>, "By day he was teaching in the temple, and by night, going out he remained abroad on the mountain called the mount of Olives.<a name=3:5></a>" Would that link on illustratively with what you are saying?<a name=3:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=3:7></a>G.<a name=3:8></a> That gives the double side of the life of Christ down here before death.<a name=3:9></a> There was the testimony and conflict side, but then there was the secret side, and that is what is connected with this eternal life.<a name=3:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.H.<a name=3:11></a>H.<a name=3:12></a> I was thinking of what you said about His secret life with the Father.<a name=3:13></a> Would that be hinted at as we are taught by the Spirit in relation to the mount of Olives?<a name=3:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=3:15></a>G.<a name=3:16></a> I thought so.<a name=3:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.D.<a name=3:18></a>T.<a name=3:19></a> Would that not be in mind when John says, "we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father"?<a name=3:20></a> (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:14">John  1:14</a>).<a name=3:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=3:22></a>G.<a name=3:23></a> Yes, I think so.<a name=3:24></a>

		H.D.<a name=3:25></a>T.<a name=3:26></a> He does not dwell so much on the Word, but the glory that shone in the relationship that was there.<a name=3:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=3:28></a>G.<a name=3:29></a> Quite so, I suppose what they contemplated as recorded in the gospel is very much the way God was coming out in Him, whereas, what they contemplated as referred to in this epistle was very much the answer to that in a Man.<a name=3:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.McD.<a name=3:31></a> Is the reference in chapter 3 to "see him as he is" additional to what is presented in these verses?<a name=3:32></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=3:33></a>G.<a name=3:34></a> Oh!<a name=3:35></a> yes, certainly, "As he is," of course, takes us on to His present position and condition in glory.<a name=3:36></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=4:3></a>G.<a name=4:4></a> That is so, but that was definitely with a view to testimony being rendered to His resurrection.<a name=4:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		F.C.<a name=4:6></a>H.<a name=4:7></a> Does that scripture in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10">Acts  10</a>include what was referred to earlier in connection with the forty days?<a name=4:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=4:9></a>G.<a name=4:10></a> Oh!<a name=4:11></a> it does undoubtedly.<a name=4:12></a> It was then that He was seen by the witnesses, but it was given with a view to their witnessing to the fact that God had raised Him from the dead, and in a way, one would suggest, that was all that was in view in that scripture; but this scripture is rather that the features of eternal life, as seen in Christ, were taken account of by the twelve, so that they could bear witness of it to ourselves.<a name=4:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.L.<a name=4:14></a> Do you think the fact that the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb are linked on with the twelve foundations in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21:14">Revelation  21:14</a>, suggests the impregnable foundation on which all was inaugurated in a trustworthy company of chosen persons -- "the men whom thou gavest me"?<a name=4:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=4:16></a>G.<a name=4:17></a> I think so.<a name=4:18></a> I think it helps to take account of the peculiarly privileged position that the twelve were in as companying with the Lord, so that in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>, for instance, we find the Lord saying to His Father -- "the words which thou hast given me," that is the divine communications, "I have given them, and they have received them," <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:8">John  17:8</a>.<a name=4:19></a> The communications from His Father, which the Lord was constantly receiving, He communicated to the twelve, drawing them into this wonderful fellowship, the fellowship with the Father and with His Son.<a name=4:20></a> They were constantly imbibing the Father's thoughts as communicated to the Son and as passed on by the Son to the twelve.<a name=4:21></a>

		E.J.<a name=5:1></a>H.<a name=5:2></a> And in the beginning of the Acts the one who was to take the place of Judas had to be equal in witness to that which the eleven had known.<a name=5:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=5:4></a>G.<a name=5:5></a> Yes, he had to be one who had assembled with them all the time the Lord Jesus came in and went out among them, beginning from the baptism of John to the day when He was taken up; so that, as you say, he had to be one who had the same experiences as the twelve.<a name=5:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.D.<a name=5:7></a>T.<a name=5:8></a> Does not the expression "until the day in which he was taken up" show that the forty days of the Lord's coming in and out were necessary for their education to be completed?<a name=5:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=5:10></a>G.<a name=5:11></a> Yes, it does.<a name=5:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.H.<a name=5:13></a>H.<a name=5:14></a> How do you regard the Lord's Person in all this?<a name=5:15></a> Clearly, as I understand, the life which you are now speaking of refers to Him as Man, the seeing and contemplating and handling would refer to Him as Man, but behind all that there lies the glory of His Person.<a name=5:16></a> Would you just say a little about that, that His Person in a way affects all this?<a name=5:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=5:18></a>G.<a name=5:19></a> I think His Person gives character to the life; it was a life lived in constant communion with His Father, but we are brought into it through the testimony of the apostles and by the Holy Spirit.<a name=5:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.McK.<a name=5:21></a> Does the idea of being "manifested to us" involve the completeness of what was manifested?<a name=5:22></a> It is not simply what was presented in testimony and might, or might not, have been received, but does the suggestion "has been manifested to us" involve a kind of adequacy and completeness?<a name=5:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=5:24></a>G.<a name=5:25></a> I would think so.<a name=5:26></a> God presented things in their completeness and wholeness at the very beginning, and what John is combating, in his first epistle, is certain suggestions that there was to be a development in Christianity over and above what came out at the beginning.<a name=5:27></a> He is countering that by

		setting out the complete thought that was in the mind of God, as set out perfectly in Christ to start with, and then everything taking character from that which was from the beginning.<a name=6:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.J.<a name=6:2></a>H.<a name=6:3></a> And there is no lower standard than that for anybody?<a name=6:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=6:5></a>G.<a name=6:6></a> No.<a name=6:7></a> So that when God brought in man in His creation, He set out the full thought that was in His mind, in the sense that Adam was never a child.<a name=6:8></a> Everyone else that came on the scene afterwards had to grow up to that, but the full thought was set out in Adam.<a name=6:9></a> So it is now with Christ; the full thought of what is to characterise Christianity, the life that is to mark it, is set out in Jesus and now we are to take character from it.<a name=6:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.A.<a name=6:11></a>L.<a name=6:12></a> Is the life that was in Christ in that way referred to by Him in <a href="../bible/John.htm#10:38">John  10:38</a> where He says, "that ye may know and believe that the Father is in me and I in him"?<a name=6:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=6:14></a>G.<a name=6:15></a> Well, that would underlie it; that passage, I suppose, is a question of the truth of His Person.<a name=6:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.H.<a name=6:17></a> Would you think the substance that appears in this remarkable word of John was gathered up from an occasion amongst others, like chapter 13, where he leant on the bosom of Jesus?<a name=6:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=6:19></a>G.<a name=6:20></a> I would think so, and what an impression of God John must have got, when Jesus washed his feet and the feet of all the disciples.<a name=6:21></a> He had in his soul the light of the glory of Christ and he would constantly say to himself, 'that is what God is capable of, a love of that character that will stoop so low and wash the feet of disciples.<a name=6:22></a>' So that in the coming day God is going to wipe away every tear from every eye, that is what God is capable of; and I believe John on that occasion would get an impression of that from the fact that Jesus stooped and washed his feet and wiped them Himself.<a name=6:23></a>

		A.J.<a name=7:4></a>G.<a name=7:5></a> I think there is.<a name=7:6></a> I have thought of that; will you say something more?<a name=7:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=7:8></a>C.<a name=7:9></a> I wondered whether that bore on what was being said as to the Lord's Person.<a name=7:10></a> The Person here was no less than God, so that what was manifested in Him was a substantial expression of the divine nature in a man.<a name=7:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=7:12></a>G.<a name=7:13></a> Yes, and a perfect answer, in a man too, to all that God was as set out in Himself, so that both sides are in Him, do you not think?<a name=7:14></a> "He is the true God," it says at the end of this epistle, "and eternal life.<a name=7:15></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.R.<a name=7:16></a>C.<a name=7:17></a> And have you in mind that what came out in Him, in that way, is to give character to what the city is, the cube you spoke of?<a name=7:18></a> Is it the formation in the saints of these features?<a name=7:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=7:20></a>G.<a name=7:21></a> Exactly.<a name=7:22></a> It is God coming out first in Christ and then in a vessel which is His fulness.<a name=7:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		W.H.<a name=7:24></a>K.<a name=7:25></a> Would it be diverting you to ask why, in the beginning of Acts during the forty days when the Lord shows Himself living, He speaks of the things concerning the kingdom of God?<a name=7:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=7:27></a>G.<a name=7:28></a> I think that is important because that is what we need.<a name=7:29></a> He assembled with them in order to convey to them impressions of the assembly, but He spoke to them the things concerning the kingdom of God; that is the bringing us into subjection to God by the Spirit, so that room is made for the substantial work of the Spirit in us, because after all Christianity is nothing if it is not substantial.<a name=7:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=7:31></a>E.<a name=7:32></a> May I ask if we have to approach the truth of the Person of Christ by way of the substantiality of His place as Man?<a name=7:33></a> I thought the term, "That which was from the beginning" is unquestionably a reference to His coming into manhood, and in chapter 5, "He is the true God and eternal life" is

	<div class="paragraph">
		unquestionably an allusion to His Person.<a name=8:1></a> And are there developed touches, as we proceed in chapters 1 and 2, up to chapter 3, to show how immediately we are dependent on what was the portion of the twelve?<a name=8:2></a> We are thus brought into the gain of that, and the "we" in chapter 3, "Beloved, now are we children of God," is inclusive rather than exclusive to the twelve.<a name=8:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=8:4></a>G.<a name=8:5></a> Yes, quite so.<a name=8:6></a> It is important to distinguish in that way in this epistle.<a name=8:7></a> Sometimes when the, apostle says "we" or "us" or "our" he is referring to the apostles, as, for instance, here, "our fellowship is indeed with the Father," and then again in chapter 4: 6, "<i>We</i> are of God; he that knows God hears us; he who is not of God does not hear us.<a name=8:8></a>" That is clearly apostolic; but then the verse you quoted from chapter 3, "now are we children of God," is general, embracing all believers; and so in chapter 5, verse 19, "We know that we are of God," that would refer to all believers, all the children of God.<a name=8:9></a> We thus have to distinguish through the epistle as to when he is referring to what was exclusively apostolic, and when he is referring to the children of God as a whole.<a name=8:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		P.L.<a name=8:11></a> Is there in the two thoughts that blend of authority and mutuality, so essential to the continuation of things here?<a name=8:12></a>

		A.J.<a name=8:13></a>G.<a name=8:14></a> That helps, I am sure.<a name=8:15></a> Authority in what is apostolic, but mutuality in what belongs to all the brethren.<a name=8:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.B.<a name=8:17></a>P.<a name=8:18></a> May we be inclined to think of the twelve as rather slow to move in relation to the heavenly side of things which came out under Paul, and does this balance our thoughts in that to see the distinctive place they had in the foundation of Christianity?<a name=8:19></a>

		A.J.<a name=8:20></a>G.<a name=8:21></a> I am sure that is important; so that was there not great substance with them?<a name=8:22></a> One has felt how, as we read this chapter, we are impressed with

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the fact that while we are being introduced to the thought of eternal life in its blessedness, yet immediately in verse 5 the apostle brings in the side of what is moral, "that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.<a name=9:1></a>" One has been impressed with the thought that Peter got a sense of that in <a href="../bible/John.htm#6">John  6</a>, when he says, "to whom shall we go?<a name=9:2></a> thou hast words of life eternal.<a name=9:3></a>" That shows that he valued the eternal life, but then he goes on to say, "<i>we</i> have believed and known that <i>thou</i> art the holy one of God.<a name=9:4></a>" He immediately shows that in connection with the thought of eternal life there must be the conditions that are suitable to what God is as light, and that was perfectly seen in Jesus, "<i>we</i> have believed and known that <i>thou</i> art the holy one of God.<a name=9:5></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=9:15></a>G.<a name=9:16></a> It was the word of life that the apostle speaks of; that is to say, the intelligible expression of life, according to God's thought of what life is.<a name=9:17></a> It was intelligibly expressed and conveyed to them in Christ, but then he goes on to say that what he has specially in mind is the eternal life.<a name=9:18></a> Life is a wider thought than eternal life; so that we get in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>, the Spirit is life on account of righteousness.<a name=9:19></a> That, in a way, is power to move in every position in which we are, including our position in responsibility and testimony, but eternal life is more limited and is connected with living in relation to the Father and His world.<a name=9:20></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.L.<a name=12:20></a> So that when the moral issue is raised by the Lord with the woman of <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>, after He has enlarged on divine giving, is she not secured testimonially in transparency in her utterance to the men of the city -- "Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done"?<a name=12:21></a> Will not the city, as the product of what is moral, be a great transparent vessel of shedding divine glory over the universe?<a name=12:22></a>

		A.J.<a name=33:1></a>G.<a name=33:2></a> We have a good deal in this chapter as to abiding in Christ, involving fixed conditions by which we are preserved, and where we commenced reading we have one of the many tests that the epistle provides, by which we are intended, as it were, to check up as to where we are and how far we are really governed by the truth.<a name=33:3></a> We cannot take the ground of knowing God, or knowing Christ, if in fact we are lawless and do not keep His commandments, so that the epistle is salutary in that way as insisting on reality.<a name=33:4></a> I think one can see, more and more, that the way that God meets the conditions which have come in through sin is by coming into those conditions Himself, first in the Person of Christ and then in the Person of the Spirit.<a name=33:5></a> Christ has come in and has overcome, passing through the world of evil in every way pleasing to God and setting forth in Himself what God is in His nature and His moral character, and then the Spirit has come in, redemption having been accomplished, in order to attach believers to Christ and form them after Christ.<a name=33:6></a> The result is that what is of God is extended, and, as we read, "the darkness is passing"; it is being gradually displaced, so far as the circle of the saints is concerned by the light.<a name=33:7></a> All around the circle of the saints is morally darkness, but it becomes constantly imperative that we should challenge ourselves by these different statements, and as thus discovering our true measure, we should be exercised to take on the truth more.<a name=33:8></a> So that we have, "He that says, I know him, and does not keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him; but whoever keeps his word, in

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=35:16></a>G.<a name=35:17></a> I think it is very useful to link it up with that.<a name=35:18></a> First of all in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:21">John  14:21</a> the Lord says, "He that has my commandments and keeps them, <i>he</i> it is that loves me; but he that loves me shall be loved by my Father, and <i>I</i> will love him and will manifest myself to him" -- that is the commandments.<a name=35:19></a> Then Judas, not the Iscariote, says, "Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself to us and not to the world?<a name=35:20></a> Jesus answered and said to him, If any one love me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we" -- that is the Father and the Son -- "will come to him and make our abode with him.<a name=35:21></a>" The result really is that the whole Godhead is there, because the Spirit is already there, according to what the Lord had said in verse 16, "another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever," and then in verse 17 "ye know him, for he abides with you, and shall be in you.<a name=35:22></a>" The result, therefore, of keeping the word of Christ is that the Father and the Son come, and They make their abode with such; the Spirit is already there, so that the whole Godhead, so to speak, is known in close proximity and the love of God becomes perfected with such.<a name=35:23></a>

		A.J.<a name=96:15></a>G.<a name=96:16></a> Yes, that is necessary in order to get the gain of the Spirit of God, and I think this simple test, "Jesus Christ come in flesh" (if the import of it is understood) is extremely important.<a name=96:17></a> It involves the truth as to Christ in a very full way, the absolute truth as to His deity and His true manhood, and then what is its import, that every other man is superseded.<a name=96:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=96:24></a>G.<a name=96:25></a> I think that helps, that denying the Son is something positive and would immediately be apparent to a true believer, but this is a question of discernment, as you say, because much that is false is clothed with that which is outwardly attractive, in the sense that the Scriptures are brought in and that kind of thing; hence the importance of really discerning what the essence of the teaching is.<a name=96:26></a>

		A.J.<a name=97:3></a>G.<a name=97:4></a> I think so.<a name=97:5></a> One has often been impressed with the circumstances surrounding the taking of Christ by those with Judas; they were in league with, and sent by, the chief priests and scribes.<a name=97:6></a> It says for instance in <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#14">Mark  14</a>, "the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how they might seize him by subtlety and kill him.<a name=97:7></a>" Those are the religious leaders, and they are moving with subtlety with a view to getting rid of Christ, and that is exactly the character of modern religious teaching.<a name=97:8></a> While it takes on the name of Christ, it is attaching Christ and the Christian teaching to the first man, with a view eventually to getting rid of the need of Christ altogether, so that it is antichristian in its character and effect.<a name=97:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=97:12></a>G.<a name=97:13></a> I would connect the expression "Jesus Christ come in flesh" with what we have in chapter 1 of John's gospel, "the Word became flesh.<a name=97:14></a>" That is to say it is the action of a divine Person; it is God Himself entering into manhood, and the popular religion of today based on following the example of Jesus as a perfect Man here, in the power of the flesh, does not confess that, does it?<a name=97:15></a>

		A.J.<a name=127:1></a>G.<a name=127:2></a> This chapter seems to emphasise the victory, or supremacy, that attaches to those who are begotten of God, the very existence of the world, which lies in the wicked one, only giving occasion for the superiority and ultimate supremacy of God, showing itself in those begotten of Him, to come into evidence.<a name=127:3></a> It is a great triumph for God, that He should be established thus in supremacy in the hearts of His own.<a name=127:4></a> We get the statement to begin with, that "Every one that believes that Jesus is the Christ is begotten of God," and then the love amongst ourselves that embraces those who are thus begotten of Him.<a name=127:5></a> We can see, I think, that no one but one who is begotten of God would believe that Jesus is the Christ.<a name=127:6></a> He is the kind of Man, according to <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#53">Isaiah  53</a>, who is despised and rejected of men, one from whom men turn away; so that no one but one in whom God has wrought would believe that Jesus is the Christ, the chosen One of God, to the exclusion of every other.<a name=127:7></a> So that Christ, in that way, becomes the test and the evidence of the work of God, or of the generation of God.<a name=127:8></a> As soon as the matter of loving the children of God comes in, the Spirit of God (through the writer of the epistle) brings in, as He often does, an immediate test, a test as to the genuineness of our love, whether it really is love that is of God or not.<a name=127:9></a> "Hereby know we that we love the children of God, when we love God <i>and keep his commandments</i>.<a name=127:10></a> For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments.<a name=127:11></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=128:17></a>G.<a name=128:18></a> Yes, that is so.<a name=128:19></a> The gospel is written, as we know, that we might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and believing have life in His name.<a name=128:20></a> The woman in chapter 4 comes to it that He is the Christ, and the man in chapter 9 comes to it that He is the Son of God, and Martha in her confession embraces both.<a name=128:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=129:14></a>G.<a name=129:15></a> I suppose the two terms together embrace the whole thought of what God effects in those who receive His testimony.<a name=129:16></a> The "begetting" is by means of what is presented in testimony, and the thought of "born," I suppose, involves the subjective work of the Spirit of God.<a name=129:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=129:28></a>G.<a name=129:29></a> I am inclined to think that the verse you refer to in <a href="../bible/John.htm#6">John  6</a>refers to the Lord personally; it says "except he who is of God, <i>he</i>" (emphatic) "has seen the Father.<a name=129:30></a>" But when we come to this epistle we are dealing with what is either begotten or born of God and that can be spoken of as "of God" characteristically.<a name=129:31></a> So that, as you say, in verse 4 of chapter 4 we have "<i>Ye</i> are of God, children," then in verse 6, "<i>We</i>" -- apostolic "we" -- "are of God; he that knows God hears us" and so on.<a name=129:32></a> Then again in verse 19 of this chapter we have, "We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in the wicked one.<a name=129:33></a>" I think where we get "of God" as attached

		J.S.<a name=130:16></a>E.<a name=130:17></a> So that when the Lord speaks to the Father in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>, He actually says "that they should know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.<a name=130:18></a>" Is He not there specifically alluding to Himself in His place as Man, whereas when the writer of this epistle says "He is the true God and eternal life" he is alluding to Christ in the glory and greatness of His Person?<a name=130:19></a>

		A.J.<a name=159:1></a>G.<a name=159:2></a> It will be noticed that these two epistles, which are of a personal character, emphasise the truth first of all as that which is a bond between us, so that John says that he loves "the elect lady and her children," and "all who have known the truth" loved them as well, for the truth's sake, and then in the third epistle John's children give him joy by reason of their "walking in the truth.<a name=159:3></a>" Then further we are to be "fellow-workers with the truth," and finally the truth itself bears witness to those who are formed by it.<a name=159:4></a> The truth therefore has a very important place in these two epistles, and also the thought of "in truth," so that we have "loving in truth" and "walking in truth.<a name=159:5></a>" The epistle, which as one has said is personal in character, contemplates I suppose the working out practically among the saints of the truth of the first epistle and, moreover, it shows (as we might expect, seeing that the truth is involved) that there will be the ceaseless efforts of the enemy against it.<a name=159:6></a> The second epistle brings in the enemy seeking to get in from outside, and the necessity for the truth's sake of being uncompromising in relation to it, and then in the third epistle the enemy seeks to operate from the inside and we have the necessity for going on with what is good in the presence of such.<a name=159:7></a>

		I shall doubtless have occasion, dear brethren, to refer to other scriptures, though not necessarily turning to them, but one would like to engage your interest in the description we have in this chapter of the assembly as it will be seen in millennial glory, understanding that what is set before us in this chapter represents what God is working to at the present time.<a name=192:1></a> It is important to keep in mind that the details that are given in this chapter of the assembly as the product of divine workmanship, are given us not simply as a matter of interest, but that we may see how far the conditions amongst us correspond with them now, and if not, that we should be concerned to accept any adjustment that may be necessary in order that the divine thoughts should be realised.<a name=192:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		the saints, they are seen sitting on thrones, they are priests of God and of the Christ and they reign with Christ for a thousand years, that is the public vindication of the saints.<a name=193:1></a> Then there is the loosing of Satan, for a short period, after a thousand years, and the final test of man, and then the coming in by God in judgment and the great white throne and evil dealt with finally.<a name=193:2></a> Then after that there is the introduction of the eternal day, the tabernacle of God with men, and God shall dwell with them and be their God.<a name=193:3></a> So the Scriptures show us how completely, how unerringly, God can and will carry everything to a right conclusion, and that is an important matter for us, dear brethren, because the present moment is a moment when we should be concerned as to carrying things to completion, the truth is given to us and the Spirit is with us for that very purpose.<a name=193:4></a> Just as God shows that He will carry everything to completion, so He looks to us, at the present time, in our own spheres of responsibility, that is our own local assemblies, to see that things are carried to completion.<a name=193:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, after all that, the Spirit of God gives us this remarkable description of the heavenly city, not in eternity, but in the day of glory, the millennium, and it is seen as a great vessel of divine administration, it comes down out of heaven from God, having the glory of God.<a name=193:6></a> Now to my mind it is very impressive that the Spirit of God, having carried things to completion, should, so to speak, go back and engage us with this wonderful description of what God is effecting in the saints at the present time, and bring it forward not so much in relation to the service of God, although, as I hope I may show, the service of God is not lacking, but bring it out as a vessel of administration.<a name=193:7></a> Now I say that, dear brethren, for this reason, that one feels for oneself, and I believe it is true for most of us, that we may have a fairly good knowledge of the truth and of divine principles

	<div class="paragraph">
		and so on, but what tests us is administration, that is putting the truth and the principles we know into actual application, that is where we are tested, and a good deal of the ministry of the last several years has been on the lines of administration, because it is in right administration that God is glorified.<a name=194:1></a> Hence the Spirit of God, as I say, goes to some pains to describe to us this beautiful vessel, this full expression of the glory of divine workmanship in a vessel which is capable of "coming down out of heaven from God, having the glory of God.<a name=194:2></a>" What I understand by that is that the influence that the saints will wield in that day will be an influence of holy love, that God will be seen in all that is done, we are to understand that administration will be actual, there will be the reigning over cities and so on given to one and another, but in the world to come the administration will be from heaven and it will be by means of the assembly.<a name=194:3></a> As we were seeing this morning and this afternoon, it is seen as a great vessel marked by immense substance, the measurements of the city being given in order that they may convey to our minds the idea of immense substance.<a name=194:4></a> Hence the importance, beloved brethren, of acquiring and developing in substance, substance that is of God, and substance that is really of God is just found in the measure in which we are formed in love, as indeed it says in Corinthians, if I "have not love, I am nothing.<a name=194:5></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, it has often been remarked that the number twelve is prominent in this chapter, constant repetition of twelve, and that is to impress us with love in unity, all the influence and administration of this vessel in that day will be in love, but in unity, a most important matter, beloved brethren, because God is one, and therefore the vessel that is to be expressive of God must be expressive of unity, must be expressive of love, but love in unity, and so twelve is taken up in Scripture as a number intended to
	</div>

		<a name=195>[Page 195]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		convey administrative ability in love operating in unity.<a name=195:1></a> Twelve, as we know very well, and I only repeat it to make the point clear, is easily manipulated; you can have twelve ones, or six twos, or four threes, or three fours, or two sixes, but whatever you have it is still the twelve, in unity, but in wonderful adaptability to the needs of the moment, and that is characteristic of love, love is never rigid, love is never legal and hard, love is easily adaptable, while maintaining the truth it is easily adaptable to the conditions that have to be served.<a name=195:2></a> How wonderfully adaptable the Lord Jesus was to the needs of the disciples.<a name=195:3></a> He would go any length to serve them in love.<a name=195:4></a> He would lay aside His garments, and take a linen towel, and gird Himself, and then pour water into a basin, and wash the disciples' feet, every one of them in turn, and wipe them with the linen towel with which He was girded.<a name=195:5></a> He wanted to leave an impression of love, He wanted to give them something that would form them, so that these things should not be simply doctrines or theories, but that they should become substantial in the saints, thus fitting them for the day when we are to come down out of heaven from God, having the glory of God.<a name=195:6></a>

		I would call attention, first of all, to what it says as to the foundations, "the wall of the city" it says "had twelve foundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.<a name=195:7></a>" That is, the ministry of the twelve is connected with the foundations of the wall.<a name=195:8></a> The ministry of the twelve was largely connected with the testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, it says in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#4:33">Acts  4:33</a>, "with great power did the apostles give witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus"; now that is not simply witness to a fact -- it is a fact, of course, the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, a most important fact, a fact that is abundantly attested, but it is not only a fact -- it has a great moral import, because the

		resurrection of the Lord Jesus was "resurrection from among the dead," it was a selective resurrection and involved that God had taken up out of death the Man Jesus, Jesus Christ, the Man who pleased Him, and had rejected every other man.<a name=196:1></a> Now we well know that, dear brethren, as sound teaching, but has it really laid hold of us?<a name=196:2></a> Because that is the first great feature in the building of the walls of this city, the walls are for the protection of what is within, and the first great feature in the wall is this understanding of the complete rejection by God of every other man and His approval of the Man Jesus Christ shown in His having raised Him up from among the dead.<a name=196:3></a> That is to be wrought into our souls, dear brethren, in a very real way, manhood that is approved of God is only learned in Jesus, the fact that He is called Jesus Christ simply means that He is the anointed or approved of God, Jesus is the Christ.<a name=196:4></a> We read in the epistle of John that some denied that Jesus is the Christ, but it is of the utmost importance to accept that <i>Jesus</i> is the Christ and give it power in our souls, that is that we want to be in line with God and to allow no other man in a practical way than that which is according to Jesus Christ.<a name=196:5></a> How much trouble would be saved, dear brethren, in our own lives and in our localities if this truth was really laid hold of and worked out, if no other man was allowed to have place.<a name=196:6></a> Jesus was a Man who sought only the will of God, who sought only the glory of God, who was characteristically obedient and characteristically dependent, there was purity of motive in all that He did, and the motive was that God was in all things to be glorified, and so we can well understand what an immense thing it is, if this is laid at the foundation.<a name=196:7></a> Indeed we know that Paul went to Corinth with that in his mind, determined to know nothing among them save Jesus Christ and Him crucified, and we read in Ephesians also

		"Jesus Christ himself being the corner-stone.<a name=197:1></a>" Now that is a matter of great importance, beloved brethren, and I need not enlarge upon it, but I only urge it on us all, because the wall, as I say, is what is for the protection of what is inside the city; the city itself, it says, is "pure gold, like pure glass," see how the purity is emphasised, the city itself is "pure gold," that is, the city itself conveys impressions of what is divine, gold speaks of what is divine and this is "pure gold," it is the glory of God shining untarnished by means of all that is done by the city.<a name=197:2></a> And when we say by the city, dear brethren, do not let us lose sight of the fact that the city is composed of the saints, that each one of us has his part in this, we do not want to lose sight of that, although it is the idea of a city, an entity, one great vessel of divine influence and glory, yet in fact it is composed of the saints, and hence we must see to it that the features that mark the city find place each one of us with ourselves.<a name=197:3></a> The city, it says, is "pure gold, like pure glass.<a name=197:4></a>"

		And now I pass on to the gates, because this is a matter of very great importance, beloved brethren, at the present time.<a name=197:5></a> It says, "the twelve gates, twelve pearls; each one of the gates, respectively, was of one pearl," so that from whatever direction the city was approached anyone seeing it would get the same impression, at whatever point administration took place, at whatever point judgment was exercised according to God, the same feature would be seen; it says, "the twelve gates, twelve pearls; each one of the gates, respectively, was of one pearl.<a name=197:6></a>" Now each of our local assemblies, beloved brethren, may be rightly likened to a gate of the city.<a name=197:7></a> In our localities matters have to be dealt with, administration has to proceed, matters as they arise have to be judged according to God; are the same features and the same principles governing us in all our localities?<a name=197:8></a> If not, to the extent that it is not so this

		feature of the city is lacking.<a name=198:1></a> There is a tendency in some places -- you will bear with me for saying it -- to a certain independence of outlook, a preparedness to adopt a private view or a local view in contrast with that which the Lord has made general among the saints; well, that is out of keeping with this thought of the city.<a name=198:2></a> It is an important matter that these things should be faced, sometimes people say, 'we must see it before we adopt it,' but then why not see it if others see it?<a name=198:3></a> In the book of Numbers we read that when the people of God were to move forward, first of all the cloud moved and I suppose priests, at any rate, would be on the look-out to see when the cloud moved, then the priests had to sound an alarm, and when they sounded the alarm the camp on the east had to move, then they sounded a second alarm and the camp on the south had to move, but there is no word about sounding a third alarm -- surely two soundings of alarm should be sufficient to set all the people in movement in their due turn, and even if they had not heard the alarm, or had not paid heed to it, surely they can see that their brethren are moving.<a name=198:4></a> If two camps have moved surely the third camp should move, and then the fourth; there is no idea of independence of outlook among the people of God, they all had to move together, even though only two alarms were given all four camps had to move, had to move in a divine order, and if they did not move they would break up the unity of God's people, and destroy the testimony and God's pleasure in them.<a name=198:5></a> Now this is an important matter, beloved brethren, and the Lord would really call our attention to it, the great danger of independence of outlook and private or local thoughts causing the brethren in some parts to abstain from following that which the Lord is giving to the saints as a whole, and setting up, it may be, private customs or independent thoughts.<a name=198:6></a>

		You remember in the history of Gideon -- and Gideon's history largely links with the truth connected with the local assembly, and runs alongside the epistles to the Corinthians -- that Gideon gained a great victory and the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb, were slain, but then there still remained something to be done, the kings Zebah and Zalmunna had still to be overthrown.<a name=199:1></a> And Gideon came to Succoth and he asked the men of Succoth to give bread to his army, he said, "I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna," and the men of Succoth said, "are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in thy hand, that we should give bread to thine army?<a name=199:2></a>" They were not at all in line with Gideon, they were not following up what Gideon was doing, and so Gideon turned from them and went on without them, but he said, when I return "I will thresh your flesh with thorns of the wilderness and with briars.<a name=199:3></a>" Then he went to Penuel, and the men of Penuel answered him in the same manner, and so Gideon had to go on without them.<a name=199:4></a> But God did deliver Zebah and Zalmunna into his hands, and when that was done and the matter was completed he returned to Succoth and seventy-seven elders were taught with briars and thorns of the wilderness, and then he turned to Penuel and broke down their tower and slew the men.<a name=199:5></a> The brethren will understand I am in no sense threatening, or chiding, or reproaching, but one would affectionately beg the brethren not to allow independence of outlook and thoughts and ways, because sooner or later the discipline of God will overtake such as do so.<a name=199:6></a> God is bent upon unity among the saints, He is bent upon this feature, "twelve gates, twelve pearls," the same beauteous feature to be seen in every locality.<a name=199:7></a> The great beauty of the pearl is that it is wholly for Christ, it does not allow any element of independence, it refers to the assembly as marked by singleness of eye and formed under the influence of Christ, and

		that should be seen in every locality, and if it is not seen there is an interference with the unity which God looks for in His assembly, and an enfeeblement of what He intends should be produced as the result of His work amongst us at the present time.<a name=200:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now we might pass on in our thoughts to a further feature in the book of Judges, and I might say in passing that you will remember in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11">Hebrews  11</a>the writer says, "What more do I say?<a name=200:2></a> For the time would fail me telling of Gideon, and Barak, and Samson, and Jephthah, and David and Samuel, and of the prophets.<a name=200:3></a>" Now that is very remarkable, the Spirit of God refers to three pairs of men and in each case He puts the second one first, that is Gideon followed Barak, but the Spirit of God puts him before Barak, Samson followed Jephthah, but the Spirit of God puts him before Jephthah, David followed Samuel, but the Spirit of God puts him before Samuel.<a name=200:4></a> Now I believe the point in that, dear brethren, is that it is Gideon and Samson and David that are prominently in the mind of the Spirit, and that Barak and Jephthah and Samuel were brought in in order to pave the way respectively for Gideon and Samson and David.<a name=200:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now let us consider Jephthah in that light, as brought in to pave the way for Samson, for Samson, I do not doubt, refers to the recovery of the highest features of the truth.<a name=200:6></a> The reason I say that is this, that in the appearing which was given to Samson's parents, they were visited by one who said that his name was "wonderful," he said "How is it that thou askest after my name, seeing it is wonderful?<a name=200:7></a>" It really point on to our Lord Jesus Christ as brought before us in the gospel of John, where the glory of the Person of Christ is so emphasised.<a name=200:8></a> He is indeed "Wonderful," and not only was the name of this angel of Jehovah Wonderful, but it says "he did wondrously, and Manoah and his wife looked on.<a name=200:9></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=201>[Page 201]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now all that is very suggestive of the gospel of John, for if you follow the gospel of John you will find that the Lord Jesus does wondrously, and so wondrously that it calls for contemplation; contemplation is a great feature in the gospel of John, "we have contemplated his glory.<a name=201:1></a>" Manoah and his wife looked on, they were held by that which they observed.<a name=201:2></a> You follow the Lord in His movements in John's gospel, especially the power and dignity in which He goes into death and disposes of it, and then rises out of it, and then ascends, as He says, "to my Father, and your Father, and to my God, and your God," see the glory of those movements, they are movements to be contemplated, and it says "the Angel of Jehovah ascended in the flame of the altar; and Manoah and his wife looked on," that is to say, it is as contemplating the movements of Christ culminating in His ascension that we get led into the highest features of the truth.<a name=201:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now, as I say, Jephthah comes in as preparing the ground for that, and in what way?<a name=201:4></a> I believe it is that Jephthah in his history sets forth the truth of headship in the wilderness.<a name=201:5></a> You remember that Jephthah's conflict was in the land of Gilead, that is, on the east side of Jordan, it was still the wilderness, the territory given to the people by the conquest of Sihon and Og, it was a wilderness position, and when the men of Gilead sent for Jephthah to come and be their saviour, they said to him, "Therefore we have returned to thee now, that thou mayest .<a name=201:6></a>.<a name=201:7></a>.<a name=201:8></a> be head over all of us the inhabitants of Gilead," and he said "shall I be your head?<a name=201:9></a>" and they assured him that he should be their head, and it says he became head and captain over them.<a name=201:10></a> Headship in the wilderness is emphasised in Jephthah's history, and that links with the beginning of <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11">1 Corinthians  11</a>, which is a matter of headship in the wilderness, having in mind the assembly, and the order in the assembly, and the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=202>[Page 202]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		bringing in of the element of subjection in the assembly, in order that we shall be able to move into that which is most precious as following on the Supper.<a name=202:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now the beginning of <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11">1 Corinthians  11</a>is a scripture over which there has been much contention in the past, and it may be still some hesitation or reserve on the part of some, but it is an important element in the truth, dear brethren, if we are to reach the greatest features of the service of God, headship in the wilderness position, the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God.<a name=202:2></a> What an important matter that is, that the element of subjection is to be seen in the man as holding Christ as his Head, and in the woman as holding the man as her head, what a word that is for us brothers, dear brethren, as to whether in point of fact we hold Christ as our Head, as to whether we look to Him for influence and impulse, whether our exercises are to take character from Him.<a name=202:3></a> We need to do that in order to have more influence ourselves.<a name=202:4></a> But then in regard of the sisters, God has placed them in a position of subjection and, therefore, He requires not only that they should be covered in "praying or prophesying" but that at all times there should be authority on their head, because of the angels, in order to show that they acknowledge this principle of subjection.<a name=202:5></a> If the chapter is read carefully, in the light that the whole position is one of headship in the wilderness, the sisters will, I am sure, see that it requires that there should always be something on the head that recognises on their part that they are under authority.<a name=202:6></a> It says in that very passage "neither is woman without man, nor man without woman, in the Lord," and "in the Lord" is not simply when you are praying or prophesying, "in the Lord" covers the whole of our position as in responsibility here, and so the whole position of headship is to be recognised if there is to be any
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=203>[Page 203]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		power to move into the greatest features of the truth.<a name=203:1></a> We know that in the case of Jephthah's history it involved great sacrifice for his daughter, but the spirit of his daughter was beautiful, she was ready for sacrifice, whatever it entailed for her she was ready for it, seeing that God had given the victory over their enemies she was ready for it, she becomes an example for the sisters to see that in every way the principle of headship in the wilderness is recognised by them.<a name=203:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the element of subjection which that calls for is a very important element in the assembly, and will help us in practical subjection to the Holy Spirit, and so we may hope to arrive in greater power and liberty at the highest features of the service of God in the assembly.<a name=203:3></a> Samson's history would bring that before us, not only that it is there objectively in what his parents were allowed to see in the Angel of Jehovah who visited them, but also in what is to be learned from his own personal history, especially after he failed, when it says the hair of his head began to grow again.<a name=203:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the great enemy in Samson's day was the Philistines, and it is the Philistines, dear brethren, which we need to fear.<a name=203:5></a> In this day when the Spirit is emphasised I am sure our great danger is the Philistine element in ourselves, that is to say the attempt to seek to compass the truth of God by our own mental energy and activities, instead of being exercised in increasing degree to give place to the Spirit of God, who will teach us the truth and lead us into it, so that we not only understand it in the Spirit, but are able to move in it in the Spirit, that is the essential thing.<a name=203:6></a> And, therefore, Samson's history illustrates that latter feature, it is a question now of developing power in life, the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven, and it culminates in this, that he overthrows more Philistines
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=204>[Page 204]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		in his death than in his life.<a name=204:1></a> If we would get the full gain of the Holy Spirit of God we must understand that it involves, in a practical way, acceptance of death, but in that acceptance the power of the Spirit becomes a known thing.<a name=204:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now there is one thing more, beloved brethren, which I would touch upon; I have sought to speak of certain elements among us which tend to hinder the full realisation of the thoughts of God.<a name=204:3></a> Let us bear in mind the thoughts of God as we get them in this chapter, and especially as I have said the "twelve gates, twelve pearls," it says "each one of the gates, respectively, was of one pearl" each one, not a single locality different from another, that is the idea, that is something, beloved brethren, to take account of.<a name=204:4></a> It is not unknown amongst us that in some places things may be done by just a few brothers, holding meetings among themselves, doubtless bringing things to the Care Meeting, but at the same time holding things among themselves as though they were elders and entitled to act as elders independently of the assembly, but that is not according to the truth; if we read <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#15">Acts  15</a>, when a matter came up for consideration, it says the apostles and elders were gathered together in relation to the matter, but as we read on we find that the whole multitude was present, the authoritative and experienced element was there, of course, in the apostles and elders, and doubtless they would have most to say, or at any rate most to say that was of any value, but at the same time the whole company was there.<a name=204:5></a> How are we all going to learn, how are the sisters going to learn, dear brethren, to judge the world and judge angels, if they do not have a living part in all the administration that has to take place in the assemblies, that is why the sisters have been brought in to the Care Meetings, because there is to be formed this great vessel of divine administration, and all the saints are to be
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=205>[Page 205]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		fitted to have their part in it.<a name=205:1></a> And so, if things are held in the hands of a few it is a disregard of the truth of the assembly, it is important that it should not be regarded lightly, it is really sin in the things of God, and should be forsaken and confessed as such, because it is militating against the truth of the assembly and it is militating against the sovereignty of the Spirit too.<a name=205:2></a> We read in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>, where it speaks of the sovereignty of the Spirit "to one, by the Spirit, is given the word of wisdom; and to another the word of knowledge .<a name=205:3></a>.<a name=205:4></a>.<a name=205:5></a> to another discerning of spirits" and so on, it does not mean that the Spirit must give it to one or another of six or seven or eight brothers, who may have assumed authority among themselves, we must recognise the assembly, and the sovereignty of the Spirit in the assembly to give help by whomsoever He is pleased to use.<a name=205:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so, dear brethren, bear with me for referring to these things practically and outspokenly, but it is with the single desire that we should all embrace the truth, and that the features of the assembly that are set before us in this scripture that God is looking for, should be practically found in expression in all our localities.<a name=205:7></a> The elders have indeed their place, do not let us think that the elders have not their place, the elders are to be treated with honour, and they certainly have a place of influence, but their influence is derived not from their having a kind of "official" position, but it is derived from what they are, and by the way they love the saints, and by the way they serve them and exemplify the truth and commend it, that is where the power of elders lies.<a name=205:8></a> If you will notice <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20">Acts  20</a>, where Paul addresses himself to the elders of Ephesus, he says, "Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, wherein the Holy Spirit has set you as overseers, to shepherd the assembly of God," "wherein," that is <i>in</i> the flock, that is where the elders are, "in the flock.<a name=205:9></a>" "Take
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=206>[Page 206]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, wherein the Holy Spirit has set you as overseers"; that is the Spirit taking account of His own work in the souls of different ones, the love that is there, the care for the saints that is there, and the Holy Spirit brings them forward as qualified and able for the position of eldership, but they are "<i>in</i> the flock," do not let us forget that.<a name=206:1></a> And then Peter in writing to the elders says, "The elders which are among you I exhort, who am their fellow-elder .<a name=206:2></a>.<a name=206:3></a>.<a name=206:4></a> shepherd the flock of God which is among you" that is, the flock is among the elders; according to Peter the flock is <i>among</i> the elders, according to Paul the elders are in the flock, in each case it conveys the idea of wonderful mutuality between the elders and the flock and nothing other than that.<a name=206:5></a> And so, dear brethren, let these things have place amongst us, let them work out, let the truth give any adjustment that may be needed in the way things are done, so that there may appear under God's eye that which answers fully to His thought according to this scripture.<a name=206:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so we find in the verses we read at the close, "no curse shall be any more; and the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him," "his servants," that is bondmen, but they serve in a priestly way, but here we get an indication that in this great vessel of divine administration, what is, so to speak, giving it tone and power is that the service of God is maintained, maintained by those that are bondmen too, by those who are wholly given to these things, wholly given up to God and His will and His service.<a name=206:7></a> His bondmen shall serve Him, serve Him in priestly service, and shall "see his face; and his name is on their foreheads.<a name=206:8></a>" They are in the full light of God as known in Christ, and His wondrous name, the name that is becoming so precious to us in these days, is on their foreheads, they stand out, they can be seen by anybody, identified
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=207>[Page 207]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		with that name, they have the intelligence of it in their souls and in the intelligence of it they serve the blessed God.<a name=207:1></a> So that is what gives tone and character to the administration, that the service of God is carried on by those who are characteristically bondmen, but who are serving in the holiness and the intelligence that belongs to priests.<a name=207:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now it is this vessel, dear brethren, that is identified as the bride, that is to say, she is attractive because of her beauty, attractive to Christ, attractive to everyone who sees her, but that attractiveness can be only taken on by us, beloved brethren, as we pay heed to the features that the Spirit of God shows He intends to secure and as we are concerned that those features should find practical expression in the various spheres for which we are responsible.<a name=207:3></a> And so the book, we might say, closes with "the Spirit and the bride say, Come" -- the Spirit is there, and the bride is there in her beauty as wholly with the Spirit, no element of divergence, no element of contention against the truth, the bride is there marked by the beauty of complete subjection to the truth of God, and as such, she is able without the slightest hindrance to join with the Spirit in one word to the Lord Jesus and to say "Come.<a name=207:4></a>" May the Lord help us in it, for His name's sake.<a name=207:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Our first scripture is probably in the setting of a dialogue between Jesus and Nicodemus, and the great matter for such a man as Nicodemus is to understand that now that Jesus Christ has come in flesh all the system with which he was connected is morally displaced and terminated.<a name=208:4></a>

		One was impressed with the word last night.<a name=211:4></a> The trumpet was sounded once, twice.<a name=211:5></a> There is no reason, therefore, that because we may have had a scripture recently, that the Lord might not use it again the second time.<a name=211:6></a> We had this scripture recently in a small meeting nearby, and one is counting on the Lord's help for something fresh in relation to these three remarkable scriptures, all being connected with women, three women, three sisters.<a name=211:7></a> The Lord Jesus says in this book, "for this cause was I born" this cause -- that I might bear witness to the truth -- <i>the truth</i>.<a name=211:8></a> That is why I came -- the truth.<a name=211:9></a> The incarnation was no afterthought with God; it was in His mind, in God's mind before time.<a name=211:10></a> And we have seen, beloved brethren, in the course of the testimony, that we needed adjustment in regard to the Lord's sonship; we have become settled in that matter.<a name=211:11></a> The Lord is very interested, too, Himself, that His place has been secured in the affections of the saints.<a name=211:12></a> He is also most desirous that the Spirit should have His place in our affections, and that is the closing feature of the truth -- the Spirit of God.<a name=211:13></a> It is no use continuing a service like this, apart from the Spirit.<a name=211:14></a> No word has any effect apart from the Spirit of God.<a name=211:15></a> He is not only with us but He is in us.<a name=211:16></a> So that in a meeting like this, perhaps the most testing meeting (apart from the care meeting) that we have, the

		In each of these remarkable dealings, beloved brethren, the words occur, "Jesus says to her," and the Lord Jesus has a word tonight, He is still speaking.<a name=212:3></a> He is speaking from heaven, but He is speaking through the blessed Spirit here tonight, and He would have us hear the word of God.<a name=212:4></a> And our brother's remarks only consolidate, and confirm, what is in one's mind, that all of us might be the gainers from a meeting like this.<a name=212:5></a> We need the prophetic word, the word of God, for Tuesday night, the meeting for ministry.<a name=212:6></a> It is well that we should see that that is the night for the meeting for ministry.<a name=212:7></a> The great servant who is now with Jesus, departed to be with Christ, gave us the thought that the meeting for ministry was on Tuesday night, and I connect it, dear brethren, with the 4th of John -- the Lord was wearied with the way He had come.<a name=212:8></a> But as the episode proceeds, He is not weary, He is refreshed in speaking of the Father.<a name=212:9></a> He speaks of the Father, and the worship of God.<a name=212:10></a>

		And I thought that in chapter 4 the Lord is speaking to a woman.<a name=212:11></a> He is speaking to the subjective element that is in our midst tonight.<a name=212:12></a> Beloved brethren, let us take it on, every one of us, one's self included, that we may be subject to the word of God.<a name=212:13></a> It is the prime feature of the moment, that we are to be subject to the word of God, the living and abiding word of God.<a name=212:14></a> It is sharper than any two-edged sword, it is piercing in its effect and it is to help us in our moral being.<a name=212:15></a> It is a prophetic word.<a name=212:16></a> And so the Lord meets this woman, and He at once removes all social distinctions.<a name=212:17></a> The Lord Jesus removes all social distinctions, dear brethren.<a name=212:18></a> It is a bane to the testimony that there

		The Lord Jesus speaks to this woman; He is seeking to adjust her.<a name=213:4></a> There were moral issues that needed adjustment, and in a meeting like this the Lord would speak to us on moral lines, so that the adjustments come; and He says, "Go, call thy husband, and come here.<a name=213:5></a>" She says, "I have not a husband.<a name=213:6></a>" You know, beloved brethren, we have to face these facts, we have to face moral issues; and the Lord says, "this thou hast spoken truly.<a name=213:7></a>" The current ministry is to bring us to the truth, not half way.<a name=213:8></a> The woman came half way, and the Lord would say to her, "thou hast spoken truly.<a name=213:9></a>" But she had not spoken all the truth.<a name=213:10></a> She had to learn the truth.<a name=213:11></a> We have to learn the truth, in the presence of God, what the truth is, it has to come out.<a name=213:12></a> If I do not agree with the ministry, let me come out with it!<a name=213:13></a> Let the brethren see where I am in relation to the truth God is presenting to us.<a name=213:14></a> Let us come out into the open, and if our wills are not active the Lord will help us.<a name=213:15></a> If our wills are active we will not receive help.<a name=213:16></a>

		Now chapter 8, dear brethren, is Saturday night, and it is another woman, but the Lord is not too sure of this woman.<a name=214:15></a> There is much that comes in amongst us in our care meetings.<a name=214:16></a> Jesus said to her, "Neither do <i>I</i> condemn thee -- go, and sin no more.<a name=214:17></a>" In the previous episode the Lord says, "Go, call thy husband.<a name=214:18></a>" She never moved; she did not have to move from her seat.<a name=214:19></a> The idea is that God would help us where we are.<a name=214:20></a> It is a question of moral issues.<a name=214:21></a> In this chapter, the Lord is interested in those who are younger amongst us.<a name=214:22></a> The issue in the 8th chapter is the elders, the issue is with the Pharisees and the scribes.<a name=214:23></a> The issue in the 8th chapter is not the woman.<a name=214:24></a> When we come to the care meeting we have got to have the facts, and we have got to have the principles.<a name=214:25></a> A beloved servant of God, now with Christ, said, 'God says to us, I will take care of the persons, you take care of the principles.<a name=214:26></a>' This servant cannot be quoted too much, dear brethren.<a name=214:27></a> The Lord Jesus has something to say.<a name=214:28></a> What is He doing, so to speak?<a name=214:29></a> What am I doing?<a name=214:30></a> The Lord is showing us what to do.<a name=214:31></a> The Lord is not too sure of the woman, but what He is interested in is that He wants to be sure that all matters are handled rightly.<a name=214:32></a> That is what He wants.<a name=214:33></a> So they go out; they are all

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, in this chapter it is the last woman in the book, and the Lord says to this beloved woman -- there are no moral issues with her -- "Touch me not.<a name=216:6></a>" You may be assured, beloved brethren, if affection for Christ is resident in your soul, individually, and you have difficulties, any difficulties, in relation to the truth, you will become adjusted in due time.<a name=216:7></a> There is no question about it.<a name=216:8></a> If your affections are right, you will get help in regard to every matter; and that is what Mary represents.<a name=216:9></a> She represents one whose affections were right in regard of Christ.<a name=216:10></a> She loved Him.<a name=216:11></a> "They have taken away <i>my Lord</i>.<a name=216:12></a>" A subject woman!<a name=216:13></a> No moral issues there.<a name=216:14></a> She is ready for the service of God.<a name=216:15></a> And the Lord has a word with her.<a name=216:16></a> "Touch me not, for I have not yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brethren and say to them, .<a name=216:17></a>.<a name=216:18></a>.<a name=216:19></a> "

		The brethren will have observed that there is a link between these passages in the thought of binding.<a name=217:2></a> Joseph's comment about his dream was, "We were binding sheaves in the fields.<a name=217:3></a>" And Abigail refers to "the bundle of the living.<a name=217:4></a>" These expressions, I trust, will develop in what the Lord may give.<a name=217:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The character of these meetings is unique.<a name=217:6></a> More than on any other occasion brethren are together from various parts of the world and thus, representatively, these meetings are universal in character.<a name=217:7></a> This is important, for I believe we are not ignorant of Satan's effort to bring in sectional feelings; to attempt, by one means or another, to bring in division of outlook or thought.<a name=217:8></a> It seems timely, therefore, that we should consider how we can all contribute to this matter of binding together, in order that the position may be preserved intact, universally, until the Lord comes.<a name=217:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Early in the gospel by Luke the writer gives us a sign, which is rather unusual for Luke.<a name=217:10></a> We have a number of signs in John's gospel, but in Luke's gospel a sign is given to the shepherds.<a name=217:11></a> The angel said "This is the sign to you -- ye shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling-clothes, and lying in a manger," <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:12">Luke  2:12</a>.<a name=217:12></a> The Spirit of God, through Luke, would give us a sign so that we may not miss our way; that what is infinitely precious to heaven is preserved in the most unlikely place.<a name=217:13></a> Though it may be in smallness and in weakness, yet its preciousness is realised and it is bound up, wrapped, so to speak, in swaddling-clothes and lying in a manger.<a name=217:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may be affected, as together, by the number of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=218>[Page 218]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		those who are present, but many of us will return to places where what is of God is found in smallness.<a name=218:1></a> The Lord would indicate to our hearts, I believe, that this sign is to characterise our day; that what is infinitely precious to heaven is to be found in the most unlikely place, as far as the world's conjecture is concerned.<a name=218:2></a> And yet, it is to be held; it is to be preserved; it is to be cared for, as suggested by this tribute to Mary -- that "she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him up in swaddling-clothes and laid him in the manger.<a name=218:3></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would not wish, in any sense, to detract from the uniqueness of the birth of Jesus, but I believe that in this sign there is the suggestion that what is precious to heaven is to be preserved and cared for in our local settings; it is all to be bound together universally, of course, but it works out locally, and it is bound together with mother feelings.<a name=218:4></a> There is no suggestion of a midwife -- I say it reverently.<a name=218:5></a> We can thank God for those with skilful and sympathetic understanding who can help the work of God through -- but here the power of motherhood is suggested, and this is greatly needed in our localities.<a name=218:6></a> Paul knew the need of it at Thessalonica; he was amongst them as a nurse with <i>her own</i> children, cherishing, yearning over them and imparting character and life to those new-born babes.<a name=218:7></a> These were features characteristic of motherhood.<a name=218:8></a> And thus Luke would write of binding together what may be outwardly weak, but infinitely precious.<a name=218:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then as Luke proceeds with his narrative he gives us a parable which the Lord Jesus spoke, after which He said, "Go, and do <i>thou</i> likewise.<a name=218:10></a>" What is set out in that parable is to be taken on by us, and it relates to binding; it has to do with recovery.<a name=218:11></a> There is a man in a half-dead state.<a name=218:12></a> He may have been pursuing his own will, but he had been caught in a trend.<a name=218:13></a> He was on his way from Jerusalem to

		Jericho, but he was not the only one on that way; there was a priest on it too, and a Levite -- indicating how <i>general</i> was the trend.<a name=219:1></a> How often we may, unwittingly, be caught in a trend like those two hundred men in <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#15">2 Samuel  15</a>who went after Absalom in their simplicity, not knowing anything.<a name=219:2></a> It is a terrible thing to be caught in a trend, but the Lord has in mind that there is to be power to bring about the resuscitation of such, and that involves binding.<a name=219:3></a> It is not now motherhood; it is a matter of bringing about resuscitation.<a name=219:4></a> Power is needed, and right feelings, too, because it says that the Samaritan had compassion!<a name=219:5></a> The priest, in his liberty to move amongst the brethren, seemed devoid of local responsibility.<a name=219:6></a> He may have said, I cannot go into details in specific cases.<a name=219:7></a> On the other hand the Levite was a local brother, for it says, " .<a name=219:8></a>.<a name=219:9></a>.<a name=219:10></a> being at the spot.<a name=219:11></a>" Yet, he was unable to deal with the matter.<a name=219:12></a> But the Samaritan, as he journeyed, "came to him, and seeing him, was moved with compassion, and came <i>up</i> to him.<a name=219:13></a>" He was not on the way down to Jericho, he was travelling <i>up</i> to Jerusalem!<a name=219:14></a> It is only those who are travelling to Jerusalem, those who have the whole universal position of the testimony in their hearts, who rightly can take matters on in a locality.<a name=219:15></a> The Samaritan took the case on and bound up the man, pouring in oil and wine.<a name=219:16></a> He would bring to bear, we might say, the full power of the kingdom of God.<a name=219:17></a> Unless we move in the Spirit's power we can effect nothing for God.<a name=219:18></a> But the Samaritan bound up the man's wounds, pouring in oil and wine -- speaking, I believe, of the essentials of the kingdom of God -- righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.<a name=219:19></a> The binding <i>must</i> be done in righteousness; if not, the wounds will break out again and there will be a worse condition than the first.<a name=219:20></a> But where righteousness enters into this binding, there will be peace and joy, too.<a name=219:21></a> The kingdom of God is not yet in display,

		I would now refer to an incident at the end of the pathway of Jesus here, when the high priest uttered, prophetically, that one man should die for the people; <a href="../bible/John.htm#11:50">John  11:50</a>.<a name=220:2></a> We are told that he did not say this of himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied.<a name=220:3></a> Thus we see the pent-up feelings of God finding public expression, "that Jesus was going to die for the nation; and not for the nation only, but that he should also <i>gather into one</i> the children of God who were scattered abroad.<a name=220:4></a>" What a reminder to us that no matter how hard we may labour, no matter how earnest our desires may be to carry on this binding, it all must be based on the precious fact that Jesus has died -- that He <i>must</i> die that He should <i>gather into one</i> the children of God who were scattered abroad.<a name=220:5></a> Oh, to think that in this our day, the last hours of church history, God would speak to our hearts about gathering into one.<a name=220:6></a> The fact that it was the high priest that uttered this word -- a man who was seeking to get rid of Jesus -- only shows how deep the feelings of God were that His mind might find expression in the midst of all the hatred that was against Christ.<a name=220:7></a> But in our hearts, beloved brethren, there is no hatred against Christ, there is <i>love</i> for Christ, but we are in a day when the children of God are still scattered abroad.<a name=220:8></a> Thank God for those that are in the bundle of the living!<a name=220:9></a> Thank God for those that are consciously in the joy of being bound in a sheaf that remains standing!<a name=220:10></a> But we would have <i>all</i> the people of God in our hearts.<a name=220:11></a> They are <i>all</i> to be gathered at our assembling together unto Him, when "the dead in Christ shall rise first; then we, the living who remain, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds" not one shall be left out!<a name=220:12></a> But in the meantime, with this in our hearts, we would seek to work out in power this matter of binding a sheaf that will remain standing.<a name=220:13></a>

		Well now, as to Joseph's dream -- no doubt his sheaf rising up looked forward to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, but I think that we are justified in applying the general idea to our local exercises.<a name=221:1></a> Joseph would represent the idea of the ministry, I believe -- what is to be effected through the ministry, for the sheaf, represents food.<a name=221:2></a> Joseph became the administrator of the food supply in Egypt.<a name=221:3></a> He was "Saviour of the world," indicating that the whole position, universally, was held intact through his skilful administration.<a name=221:4></a> Oh, how we need to have the universal position in our hearts, that the whole position may be held; that none may be lost.<a name=221:5></a> The Lord Jesus could say that of those whom the Father had given Him, He had lost none save the son of perdition, that the scripture might be fulfilled.<a name=221:6></a> Think of that wondrous sheaf which had been gathered to the bosom of Jesus and bound together!<a name=221:7></a> It remained standing!<a name=221:8></a> See it on the day of Pentecost -- Peter standing up with the eleven -- the sheaf remained standing!<a name=221:9></a> And it <i>will</i> remain standing.<a name=221:10></a> It was the nucleus of what is going right through!<a name=221:11></a> And we all want to be in it.<a name=221:12></a> But there is a danger of <i>not</i> being in it.<a name=221:13></a> Other sheaves are being bound.<a name=221:14></a> Joseph's brethren were binding sheaves, too.<a name=221:15></a> Let us have no part in the binding of a sheaf that will <i>not</i> remain standing.<a name=221:16></a> His brethren could say, "We are all one man's sons; we are honest," <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#42:11">Genesis  42:11</a>.<a name=221:17></a> They had bound a sheaf, but it was not complete; they had to say, "The youngest is this day with our father, <i>and one is not</i>.<a name=221:18></a>" In their binding, they had left one out!<a name=221:19></a> Let us not leave out one, let us hold <i>all</i> in our affections!<a name=221:20></a>

		The details in the scripture show the practical skill which Joseph used in bringing in adjustment.<a name=223:15></a> He immediately raised the question of the <i>brother</i>.<a name=223:16></a> And then he divided two brethren -- Simeon and Levi.<a name=223:17></a> Jacob could say of them -- "Instruments of violence their swords.<a name=223:18></a> My soul, come not into their council; mine honour, be not united with their assembly," <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#49:5">Genesis  49:5</a>.<a name=223:19></a> In principle, he says, Let me never be in a care meeting where Simeon and Levi are!<a name=223:20></a> Never do I want to be in their council!<a name=223:21></a> "Scatter them in Israel.<a name=223:22></a>" And so Joseph separates them, he "divides them in Jacob.<a name=223:23></a>" He bound Simeon before their eyes when he sent the others home.<a name=223:24></a> He said, as it were, this matter will go better if Simeon is not with Levi when the brothers go back to work things

		And now to speak about Abigail.<a name=224:8></a> I believe she represents an element that characterises the body of the saints -- the sympathetic subjective work of God in His people.<a name=224:9></a> That element is abundantly amongst us.<a name=224:10></a> It is sound; it is spiritual; it has right feelings; it has a right judgment of things.<a name=224:11></a> Thank God for it!<a name=224:12></a> It is the spiritual element amongst us.<a name=224:13></a> It is not always in the forefront, alas!<a name=224:14></a> It may be unnoticed, but it is there.<a name=224:15></a> In the forefront at Carmel was a man who was shearing sheep.<a name=224:16></a> Is it possible that there may be with us, in some sense, a tendency to exploit the saints?<a name=224:17></a> Before I leave the matter of the ministry I would address a word to myself and to all who have part in Levitical service, as we call it.<a name=224:18></a> Are we wholly delivered from a tendency to exploit the saints?<a name=224:19></a> The beloved brethren, in our day, have hearts which flow out freely.<a name=224:20></a> I have been greatly touched, while in this country, to receive practical expressions of the love and fellowship of the saints.<a name=224:21></a> This is something which must be regarded and appreciated with spiritual feelings, lest, in any way, we be marked by covetousness.<a name=224:22></a> Paul reminds the brethren at Thessalonica

		And then we see that Abigail went to David with a gift.<a name=227:12></a> In a place characterised by exploitation, the spiritual element rises up to control the situation on the basis of good feelings, which can only exist and find vent when the evil has been named and dealt with.<a name=227:13></a> Thus the wealth that is amongst the saints is now brought into availability.<a name=227:14></a> The yoke of self-interest is thrown off and good feelings mark the saints.<a name=227:15></a> Again we have the administration of food to meet conditions, but here it is in the spontaneous outflow of affections from a spiritual element that rises up to offset the evil, using weapons which are not carnal but nevertheless mighty and effectual.<a name=227:16></a>
