		It will be clear, dear brethren, that the history of Elisha corresponds with the present time.<a name=1:1></a> That is, Elijah was taken up into heaven and Elisha was left here in testimony in his absence.<a name=1:2></a> And his history therefore represents the position of the saints here on earth, as in the charge and possession of the Holy Spirit, as in testimony to God.<a name=1:3></a> And therefore it has a distinct voice to us.<a name=1:4></a> And especially this passage we have read in chapter 2, because Elijah was passing Elisha through a period of instruction with a view to his learning how to fill the place of testimony here in a way that would be approved of God.<a name=1:5></a> And so the chapter opens with it saying that when Jehovah would take up Elijah into the heavens by a whirlwind Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.<a name=1:6></a> Elisha was already at Gilgal.<a name=1:7></a> That is an important starting point, for Gilgal as we know, represents the cutting off of the flesh.<a name=1:8></a> It is of no use our thinking of being here in testimony for God if we are not going to accept the cutting off of the flesh, which has taken place for God in the cross of Christ, and which we are intended to maintain in our souls by the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=1:9></a> For as we were saying this afternoon, the Spirit of God is always faithful to Christ in heaven and to His cross.<a name=1:10></a> He is faithful to Christ in heaven in keeping before us the Man in whom God delights, and faithful to His cross, as that point where God has terminated judicially the history of the first man.<a name=1:11></a> This is not a matter, dear brethren, of mere doctrine.<a name=1:12></a> It is a matter of what has actually taken place.<a name=1:13></a> Let us not forget that, that the death of Christ on the cross has actually taken place.<a name=1:14></a> And that when He took His place on the cross for us,

		and was made sin, God judged sin in the flesh -- condemned it, in the Person of His Son.<a name=2:1></a> And when Christ died and was buried there was before God the actual termination in death vicariously of those who put their trust in Christ and their actual putting out of sight in His burial.<a name=2:2></a> The death and burial of Christ are part of the gospel which we have received, and it is important therefore that we should be ready to accept the moral import of the death and burial of Christ.<a name=2:3></a> We are not honest if we are not prepared to accept the moral import of the death and burial of Christ, for it is an essential part of the gospel which we have believed.<a name=2:4></a> And as I say, the Spirit of God is always faithful to Christ personally and to His death.<a name=2:5></a>

		Now Elisha, so far, was at the right spot.<a name=2:6></a> He was at Gilgal.<a name=2:7></a> And Elijah, it says, went with Elisha from Gilgal.<a name=2:8></a> That is, Elijah would give Elisha to understand that he, Elijah, was prepared to be with Elisha.<a name=2:9></a> But then in the history that follows, the exercise which Elijah raised with Elisha, was whether Elisha was prepared to be with Elijah.<a name=2:10></a> And that is an important matter.<a name=2:11></a> As it says in one of the chapters of 2 Chronicles, "The Lord is with you, while ye be with him.<a name=2:12></a>" That is there are certain conditions necessary if the Lord is to be with us.<a name=2:13></a> He wants to be with us, indeed He says, "I am with you all the days, until the completion of the age.<a name=2:14></a>" He is prepared to be with us, but in actual fact, He can only be with us, in the sense of real power and support, if we are with Him.<a name=2:15></a> And that is the question which the rest of the verses which I read in chapter 2 raise, whether Elisha is prepared to be with Elijah.<a name=2:16></a> Elijah tests him three times over by inviting him to remain where he was while Elijah went on elsewhere, and in each case Elisha says, "As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.<a name=2:17></a>" That is, he was determined that he would be with Elijah wherever he went.<a name=2:18></a> Now that is a most important

	<div class="paragraph">
		matter, dear brethren, if we would be with the Lord and with God in the testimony, that we must be prepared for movement, for the Lord is always in movement.<a name=3:1></a> The testimony is in movement.<a name=3:2></a> The Lord says, "Where I am, there also shall be my servant.<a name=3:3></a>" And while I do not doubt that that refers, in one sense, to the future, the reward that the servant will have in being with Christ, I believe it has very definitely a present voice, that if any one would serve the Lord he must be concerned to be with the Lord where He is at the moment.<a name=3:4></a> And where the Lord is at the moment is to be discerned by the distinctive ministry which the Lord is giving.<a name=3:5></a> And so, Elijah says, "Jehovah has sent me to Bethel.<a name=3:6></a>" And Elisha goes with him to Bethel.<a name=3:7></a> I understand the force of these movements of Elijah to one place after another, is that he would have Elisha learn Elijah's view, Elijah's judgment, of them.<a name=3:8></a> And hence it is for us to inquire what these places represent, and what the Lord has to say in regard of them -- what His view of the matter is.<a name=3:9></a> Bethel, as we know, is the house of God.<a name=3:10></a> And we know, from the first epistle to Timothy, that it is "the assembly of the living God.<a name=3:11></a>" You remember how Paul said to Timothy, "That thou mayest know how one ought to conduct oneself in God's house, which is the assembly of the living God; the pillar and base of the truth.<a name=3:12></a>" And hence, the first thing the Lord would raise with us, with a view to our being fitted to be here in the testimony, is whether we have a right view of the assembly.<a name=3:13></a> Have we got His view of it?<a name=3:14></a> Elisha had to go with Elijah to Bethel, and to see what Elijah thought about Bethel.<a name=3:15></a> And that is an important matter that the Lord would raise, as to whether we have a right view of the assembly, because every one of us who has received the Holy Spirit, belongs to it.<a name=3:16></a> Each one is an essential part of it.<a name=3:17></a> And the first thing that is said about it, and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the first thing that Bethel brings to our minds, is that it is the house of God.<a name=4:1></a> God is dwelling in us by the Holy Spirit, as it says, "A habitation of God in the Spirit.<a name=4:2></a>" And that, one might say, for the sake of any younger ones, is not merely what we are when we are convened, it is what we are always, whether we are together or not.<a name=4:3></a> We are always the house of God in virtue of the fact that God is dwelling in us by the Spirit.<a name=4:4></a> God Himself has taken up His abode in us.<a name=4:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, what kind of behaviour befits those who compose the house of God?<a name=4:6></a> We cannot get away from it even if we would.<a name=4:7></a> God has taken up His abode in us permanently.<a name=4:8></a> The Spirit is never going to leave us.<a name=4:9></a> What kind of behaviour then befits those in whom God is dwelling?<a name=4:10></a> That is something for us to have always in mind.<a name=4:11></a> And not only that but that the assembly, which is the house of God is the pillar and base of the truth.<a name=4:12></a> Now that is a very wholesome matter for us to face, because the truth is in this world in testimony and the assembly is the pillar and base of it.<a name=4:13></a> The idea of a pillar is something that stands out prominently in order to represent the matter in question.<a name=4:14></a> And the assembly is the pillar of the truth.<a name=4:15></a> Now it may be that some have not apprehended the importance of the truth.<a name=4:16></a> Let me just say this that from the moment that the serpent said to the woman in the garden of Eden, "Hath God said," and then he went further and said, "Ye shall not surely die: For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, .<a name=4:17></a>.<a name=4:18></a>.<a name=4:19></a> ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil," insinuating to her mind that God was untruthful, that He was not reliable and that He was holding back from man something that was for his advantage, from that moment the truth has been in conflict in this world.<a name=4:20></a> The truth has been called in question from that moment, and now God has set Himself out to bring
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the truth into display in this world.<a name=5:1></a> He desires that all men should be saved and come to a knowledge of the truth, and that is the truth as to God, the answer to Satan's lie, and the assembly is the pillar of the truth and the base of it.<a name=5:2></a> Hence the importance of the assembly and the responsibility attaching to it that persons are to get their right thoughts as to God from the assembly.<a name=5:3></a> That is the vessel to which the truth of God is committed, the divine intention is that people should get right thoughts as to God from the assembly.<a name=5:4></a> Hence, as I say, dear brethren, this is a very important matter to face.<a name=5:5></a> You can understand Elijah putting the test to Elisha.<a name=5:6></a> I do not suppose for a moment that Elijah hoped that Elisha would stay where he was, he simply invited him to stay where he was in order to bring out the determination that was there in Elisha not to tarry where he was but to move on with Elijah.<a name=5:7></a> And the first place that Elijah saw that it was necessary that he should go to, was Bethel, in order that he should get a right view of the fact that the house of God is here.<a name=5:8></a> And so, as you remember, the apostle Paul, in the first epistle to the Corinthians, speaks to us individually in respect of the great fact that the Holy Spirit is here in each one of us.<a name=5:9></a> He says, "Do ye not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, which is in you, which ye have of God?<a name=5:10></a> "And hence the great fact of the dwelling here in believers of the Holy Spirit is to have effect on the way in which we hold our bodies, where we take them, and what we do with them, because our bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit.<a name=5:11></a> How it dignifies the believer's body -- the youngest believer, how valuable his body is, how dignified it is.<a name=5:12></a> That God Himself has taken up His abode in that frail, human, mortal vessel, the body of the believer.<a name=5:13></a> So that is the first thing, that Elisha was to go to Bethel.<a name=5:14></a> And then the next thing is, Elijah says to him, "Abide here, I

	<div class="paragraph">
		pray thee, for Jehovah has sent me to Jericho.<a name=6:1></a>" Now Elisha is to be at Jericho with Elijah, he is to have Elijah's view of Jericho.<a name=6:2></a> Jericho, as we know, is the world.<a name=6:3></a> It is the world as a great system which Satan has built up and which he would use to hinder the saints of God getting into the inheritance which God has in mind for them.<a name=6:4></a> Later on in this chapter we find that Jericho, as a city, was pleasantly situated.<a name=6:5></a> They say to Elisha, "The situation of the city is good.<a name=6:6></a>" "But," they say, "the water is bad, and the land is barren," and that is exactly what the world is.<a name=6:7></a> It is in a favourable situation at the present moment, and has been ever since Christ went on high, because God is favourable to it.<a name=6:8></a> He is longsuffering, not desiring that any should perish.<a name=6:9></a> So it stands in a favourable position at the present time, but at the same time its water is bad and the land is barren.<a name=6:10></a> That is the resources of life, of life morally, that the world provides, are bad, they have no goodness in them, and there is no fruitfulness for God in the world, as such.<a name=6:11></a> Let not men deceive the saints by suggesting that there are features about the world that are good, and so on, we want to have God's estimate of it.<a name=6:12></a> The Lord said of the Holy Spirit that having come, He would bring demonstration to the world of sin, and of righteousness and of judgment.<a name=6:13></a> "Of sin," He says, "because they do not believe on me.<a name=6:14></a>" Well that holds good today.<a name=6:15></a> The world, as such, does not believe on Christ, and the believer should hold that in his mind, and not be deceived by anything plausible that might suggest what was good in connection with the world.<a name=6:16></a> "They believe not on me" is equally true now as when the Lord spoke the word.<a name=6:17></a> And hence we need to be with the Lord in that and have His judgment and the Spirit's judgment about the world, in which we are, in God's ways, as a matter of testimony.<a name=6:18></a> And then, not only does it not believe on Christ, but it is

	<div class="paragraph">
		exposed, by the presence of the Spirit, in regard of righteousness; it is exposed as unrighteous.<a name=7:1></a> The world had no place for <i>the</i> righteous One, and it has no place for Him.<a name=7:2></a> He says, "Of righteousness because I go away to my Father.<a name=7:3></a>" That is the way the truth is presented in John's gospel.<a name=7:4></a> Not that the Lord was crucified and taken by wicked hands and crucified and slain, although the fact that He was crucified is recorded in John's gospel, but the point of view in John's gospel is that the Lord <i>departed from</i> the world and went to the Father.<a name=7:5></a> He departed from the world because there was no room for Him in the world.<a name=7:6></a> "They have both seen and hated," He says, "both me and my Father.<a name=7:7></a>" "They hated me without a cause.<a name=7:8></a>" There was no room for the righteous One in the world and therefore He left it and went to His Father, and the world stands exposed in respect of righteousness by that very fact.<a name=7:9></a> And then He says, "Of judgment because the ruler of this world is judged.<a name=7:10></a>" That is, the Lord has left the world as a judged thing, and He would have us understand that the prince of the world is judged.<a name=7:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, all that, I believe, enters into this matter of going to Jericho.<a name=7:12></a> We want first of all to have God's view of the assembly and how great it is.<a name=7:13></a> How helpful to us to remember that we belong to the house of God -- that we form it.<a name=7:14></a> And that the assembly is the pillar and base of the truth.<a name=7:15></a> How important that is.<a name=7:16></a> But then we are also to have the Lord's own view of the world, and to hold it in our minds, so that we are not in any way attracted or diverted by it.<a name=7:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And then, at each of these places, if you will notice, the sons of the prophets come to him and say, "Dost thou know that Jehovah will take away thy master from over thy head today?<a name=7:18></a>" And he said, "I also know it; be silent!<a name=7:19></a>" I believe that is intended to

	<div class="paragraph">
		convey to us that Elisha felt the fact that Elijah was going to be taken away.<a name=8:1></a> It becomes a test to us as to whether we really feel the absence of Christ.<a name=8:2></a> Elisha says, "I also know it: be silent!<a name=8:3></a>" as though he had deep feeling about it.<a name=8:4></a> The sons of the prophets could tell him the truth, the actual fact, but he says, "I also know it: be silent!<a name=8:5></a>" As though to say, I do not need to be reminded about that, I am very much feeling it that Elijah is going to be taken from me this day.<a name=8:6></a> And so it raises the question as to whether we are really feeling in regard of the absence of Christ from this scene.<a name=8:7></a> But now it goes on to say that Elijah said, "Abide here, I pray thee, for Jehovah has sent me to the Jordan.<a name=8:8></a>" And it says, "They two stood by the Jordan, and Elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smote the waters and they were divided hither and thither; and they two went over on dry ground.<a name=8:9></a>" I believe that is intended to convey to us, that in our minds and in our hearts' affections we are to contemplate the movements of Christ into death and out of it.<a name=8:10></a> For Jordan, of course, represents the death of Christ.<a name=8:11></a> We know how triumphantly the ark moved into the Jordan when God was going to bring His people into their inheritance.<a name=8:12></a> We remember how they were told to keep a distance of two thousand cubits between the ark and themselves, in order that they might have their attention fixed on the ark, that they might get an impression of the power and dignity of the ark as it moved forward into the Jordan.<a name=8:13></a> As the feet of the priests that bore the ark touched the brim of the water the Jordan went back and there was dry ground made over Jordan.<a name=8:14></a> Jordan, we are told, overflowed all its banks at harvest time.<a name=8:15></a> It has, I understand, a succession of banks in terraces, and all these banks were overflowed at harvest time, and it was at that time that the ark went into Jordan.<a name=8:16></a> So it is to emphasise to us the completeness of the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		victory of Christ over death when He went into death.<a name=9:1></a> The ark went into the midst of Jordan and there it remained, until all the people had passed over.<a name=9:2></a> And the ark in the midst of Jordan, with no waters visible at all, bore witness to the complete victory of the ark over Jordan.<a name=9:3></a> For the antitype to it we have not only to take account of Christ going into death, but of His rising triumphantly from the dead, because it is there, in resurrection from the dead, that the completeness of His victory over death is seen.<a name=9:4></a> And how much entered into the death of Christ.<a name=9:5></a> The judgment of God was there.<a name=9:6></a> The power of Satan was there.<a name=9:7></a> The penalty upon man was there.<a name=9:8></a> All was there.<a name=9:9></a> All was entered into when the Lord went into death, and how complete has been His triumph!<a name=9:10></a> And He went into death in order that He might open up a way through death for the saints to be brought into that which is in God's purpose for them.<a name=9:11></a> I wonder whether we realise that our life is really bound up with Christ?<a name=9:12></a> Or do we simply view it that when we can no longer live here then there is something provided for us in heaven.<a name=9:13></a> Which is it to be, dear brethren, that we hold on to life here as long as we can with the comfortable assurance that when we can no longer remain here there is a place for us in heaven, or do we really believe, that according to the purpose of God, our life is bound up with Christ above.<a name=9:14></a> The things above are our portion, because that is what is to come into view as we see Christ going into death and rising again.<a name=9:15></a> It is a question of Christ as the power of God to open up a way for His people to move into that which His love from the very outset has had for them.<a name=9:16></a> And so that would very effectively detach us from this scene, save as recognising our responsibility to be in it in faithfulness in testimony.<a name=9:17></a> But as regards our vital interests, they are in another scene.<a name=9:18></a> As it says in the epistle to Philippians, Our commonwealth is in

		heaven, that is where it is.<a name=10:1></a> It is not that it is going to be there, but it is there, and it is there because Christ is there, and because the assembly belongs to Christ, as given to Him from the very beginning.<a name=10:2></a> It is a great thing to get into our minds that we belong to heaven, and we belong there because we belong to Christ, and that He is there, and that He has deliberately and in majesty gone into death and risen triumphantly out of it in order to make a way through for the people of God to pass over into the inheritance that divine love has given them.<a name=10:3></a> And the Holy Spirit is the Earnest of our inheritance.<a name=10:4></a> So that while we are still here for a moment in the ways of God, and in order to serve Him and to be here in testimony, we have the power in the Holy Spirit to enter into the things that are ours.<a name=10:5></a> The only thing, really, that we have not got, or that we have not the Earnest of, is the glorified condition.<a name=10:6></a> I quite admit that our measure is small, though there is no reason why it should not be greater, and I suppose, at the very best, we only enter into spiritual things in part at the present time, as Scripture says, "Now I know in part, but then shall I know even as also I am known," at the same time we have the Spirit as the Earnest of our inheritance.<a name=10:7></a> He links us up in our affections with Christ where He is, and He becomes the means by which we may enter livingly into things that belong to heaven.<a name=10:8></a> Well now, all that is in view in our going, so to speak, with Elijah to Jordan.<a name=10:9></a> And it says, "Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither; and they two went over on dry ground.<a name=10:10></a>" It is a question of the inherent power that there was in the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=10:11></a> It was not possible that He should beholden of death.<a name=10:12></a> It was not possible that He should be overcome by all that He entered into.<a name=10:13></a> That is the glory of Christ.<a name=10:14></a> Who

		else but the Lord Jesus, the Son of God, a divine Person, could exhaust the judgment of God?<a name=11:1></a> Who else could go into death in absolute holiness and rise out of it?<a name=11:2></a> It was not possible that He should be holden of it.<a name=11:3></a> And Elijah wrapping his mantle together, I believe, is to convey to us the concentrated power that was there in the Person of Christ on account of who and what He was intrinsically, for it was not possible that He should be holden of death.<a name=11:4></a> And so with the mantle wrapped together, Elijah smote the waters and they divided hither and thither, and they two went over on dry ground.<a name=11:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, so much for the education of Elisha, and so much, dear brethren, for our education too, as we take these things up in the spiritual import of them.<a name=11:6></a> But now Elijah says to Elisha, "Ask what I shall do for thee before I am taken away from thee," and Elisha said, "Let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.<a name=11:7></a>" A double portion.<a name=11:8></a> I suppose that may imply that we are to be impressed with the greatness of Christianity.<a name=11:9></a> And when I speak of Christianity I mean what is here in this day of the Spirit.<a name=11:10></a> The Lord Himself said, "Greater works than these shall he do, because I go unto my Father," suggesting that the apostles as having the Spirit would do even greater things than He had done.<a name=11:11></a> This is a remarkable thing, showing how great the day of the Spirit is.<a name=11:12></a> Even the shadow of Peter, falling upon persons, apparently healed them, and napkins taken from the body of Paul and put upon sick persons healed them.<a name=11:13></a> Such is this day of the Spirit.<a name=11:14></a> But I believe also that Elisha's request for a double portion of Elijah's spirit conveys that he had a very real sense of his own smallness of measure.<a name=11:15></a> I think it would convey that Elisha in his own mind was comparing himself with Elijah, and saying, Well, if I've got to be here in your absence, in the place that you have filled, I shall need a double

	<div class="paragraph">
		portion of your spirit.<a name=12:1></a> I believe it was a sense that Elisha had of his own smallness, his own inequality for the position.<a name=12:2></a> And that surely is a fitting feeling with us, for if we think of the things "which <i>Jesus</i> began both to do and to teach," and the thought of being here as a continuation of Jesus, we should certainly feel, and rightly feel, that we could not possibly fill out that position save in the fulness of the power of the Spirit.<a name=12:3></a> And so Elisha says, "I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.<a name=12:4></a>" And Elijah says, "Thou hast asked a hard thing.<a name=12:5></a>" That is to say, it is not going to be arrived at without exercise, nevertheless he says, "If thou see me when I am taken from thee it shall be so to thee, but if not, it shall not be so.<a name=12:6></a>" What does that mean for us?<a name=12:7></a> It means, surely, dear brethren, the need of constant watchfulness, the need of constant dependence.<a name=12:8></a> You can understand that Elisha would be saying, I dare not take my eye off Elijah now.<a name=12:9></a> If I take my eye off Elijah now he may be taken from me that moment, and then I shall not have the double portion of his spirit.<a name=12:10></a> You can understand what care, what vigilance, it would create, how much Elisha would feel the need of it, his need of watchfulness.<a name=12:11></a> And that is the thing that we all need, dear brethren, at this present time.<a name=12:12></a> Perhaps never more so than now because God is working mightily among the saints, and Satan is active also.<a name=12:13></a> Be assured of that, wherever God is working Satan is not far off, and he is very near to us all, and therefore constant vigilance and constant distrust of ourselves are needed if we are to be here, until the Lord comes, according to His mind.<a name=12:14></a> And so it says, "It came to pass as they went on, and talked, that behold, a chariot of fire and horses of fire; and they parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into the heavens.<a name=12:15></a> And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father!<a name=12:16></a> the chariot of Israel

		Well now, in closing, I wanted to refer briefly to the sixth chapter because that brings in another feature in connection with the testimony which the Lord is stressing at the present time.<a name=15:6></a> The great characteristic feature of Christianity is, of course, the presence of the Holy Spirit.<a name=15:7></a> That is <i>the</i> dominating feature of Christianity.<a name=15:8></a> The Holy Spirit does not simply come upon men from time to time as He did in Old Testament times, but He is here abidingly.<a name=15:9></a> As the Lord said, "God gives not the Spirit by measure.<a name=15:10></a>" Christianity is characterised by the unmeasured giving of the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit having come in personally to abide in each believer and to abide in the assembly, constituting it an habitation of God.<a name=15:11></a> But then there is also another provision for the testimony and that is that the angels of God, which, we are told, are innumerable, are all sent forth, without exception; the scripture says so, and therefore we are to believe it.<a name=15:12></a> Michael is active and Gabriel is active, and the innumerable company of angels, "sent forth," it says, "to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation.<a name=15:13></a>" What a dignity it places upon us, dear brethren, that we are so provided for.<a name=15:14></a> What is it

		That is that Elisha as the vessel of testimony, typical of the saints as in the good of the Holy Spirit, can know what is going on, they can know the movements of the enemy.<a name=17:1></a> The Holy Spirit is God Himself.<a name=17:2></a> He knows all that is going on.<a name=17:3></a> There is not a single movement of the enemy, not a single thought even that men may conceive, that God does not know about.<a name=17:4></a> And therefore if we were more ready to be available to the Spirit, we can be assured of this, that anything that Satan intends to bring in to oppress or hinder the saints, the Spirit of God can make known to us.<a name=17:5></a> And so finding himself outwitted as regards intelligence, the king of Syria thinks that he will use force, and so he sends an army, thinking, of course, that one man and his attendant will be no match for an army.<a name=17:6></a> The young man, his attendant, is disturbed, but Elisha is not disturbed.<a name=17:7></a> He says, "They that are with us are more than they that are with them.<a name=17:8></a>" I suppose in the first place we may say that that is the Spirit Himself.<a name=17:9></a> It says, "Greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world.<a name=17:10></a>" So far as all that is spiritual is concerned, and knowledge and understanding and so on we are infinitely better off than the best brains in the world, because we have the Spirit of God.<a name=17:11></a> But there is also this great fact that there is an innumerable company of angels.<a name=17:12></a> There is no army in the world that is innumerable.<a name=17:13></a> They may run to large numbers, but there is no army in the world that is innumerable.<a name=17:14></a> And the saints have an innumerable company of angels to support them if need be, but not necessarily to preserve them from suffering.<a name=17:15></a> It is not intended that the testimony is to go through without suffering, because it is in suffering that fidelity is proved, and it is in suffering, in suffering for the truth, that one feature of conformity to Christ is brought about.<a name=17:16></a> So we must not expect that God will intervene angelically to prevent the saints

		But I wish to speak now of what we are as brethren of one another -- as those who are born of God.<a name=21:3></a> And that involves that we are to love one another, and that involves too that we are to care for one another's souls.<a name=21:4></a> It is interesting that at the outset, as we read in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#4">Genesis  4</a>, God makes so much of Abel being <i>a brother</i>.<a name=21:5></a> Adam and Eve had been recovered, you might say, to God.<a name=21:6></a> God had brought home to them their guilt, and then He had clothed them with coats of skin, so that, typically at any rate, and I have no doubt in some measure of consciousness of acceptance, they were now set up as being instructed in righteousness, having a judgment of sin, but there as in the value of redeeming love.<a name=21:7></a> I am not speaking of how far they were intelligent, but that is what we can see in it.<a name=21:8></a> That they had been convicted of sin, and that God had provided them with a righteousness, based on the death of a substitute, so that they were really set up now as a witness to righteousness and a witness to redeeming love.<a name=21:9></a> But now Cain is born and Eve thinks she has acquired a man from the Lord; she thinks that the seed of the woman has already arrived in this son Cain who was born, and she names him Cain, meaning "Acquisition" and saying, "I have acquired a man with Jehovah," but she turned out to be mistaken; her son turned out to be the beginning of the line of "the wicked one" -- that is what John's epistle tells us, that "Cain was of the wicked one.<a name=21:10></a>" So that God having recovered Adam and Eve and set them up in this

		abides in death.<a name=32:1></a>" And now it says, "Hereby we have known love.<a name=32:2></a>" It is a question, not now of brotherly love, although love is to find expression in the circle of the brethren, and development there, but now it is love in its absoluteness, what God is in His nature.<a name=32:3></a> We are taught in Peter's epistle that in brotherly love we are to have love.<a name=32:4></a> So it says, "Hereby we have known love, because He has laid down his life for us.<a name=32:5></a>" That is always to be before our minds and hearts, that love has come into expression.<a name=32:6></a> God is love, and what God is has come into perfect expression in Jesus.<a name=32:7></a> He has laid down His life for us, and we ought, it says -- it is now a question of moral obligation -- "we ought, for the brethren, to lay down <i>our</i> lives.<a name=32:8></a>" That shows that the circle of the brethren is constituted for the express purpose of the expression and development of love, because God is love.<a name=32:9></a> And one of the ways in which love expresses itself is that we accept the responsibility to care for our brethren, and especially to care for their souls.<a name=32:10></a> Remember what it says in the epistle to the Ephesians, "Be ye therefore imitators of God, as beloved children, and <i>walk</i> in love, even as the Christ loved us, and delivered Himself up for us, an offering and sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour.<a name=32:11></a>" Love is of God, and we are to be imitators of God, but if we are to learn love in its expression, we learn it in Christ, as it is said, "the Christ loved us and delivered himself up for us, an offering and sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour.<a name=32:12></a>" I believe the expression of love was so perfect in Christ when He gave Himself for us, that it went up to God as a sweet-smelling savour.<a name=32:13></a> Love in activity as of God was seen in Christ in such perfection in self-sacrifice, that it went up to God as a sweet-smelling savour.<a name=32:14></a> And now we are to take on the same features, we are to <i>walk</i> in love as imitators of God, as beloved children.<a name=32:15></a>

		And so, as I was saying a moment ago, in order that these things should not be theoretical with us, the epistle contemplates that we should keep our eyes open, so it says, "Whoso may have the world's substance, and see his brother having need, and shut up his bowels from him, how abides the love of God in him?<a name=33:1></a>" And then chapter 5 says, "If anyone <i>see</i> his brother sinning a sin, not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life, for those that do not sin unto death.<a name=33:2></a>" That is in material things and in spiritual things we are to have our eyes open to see how the brethren are getting on, and if anyone sees his brother, or of course, his sister, sinning a sin, not unto death, the first thing he should do is to ask for him -- to ask God.<a name=33:3></a> He should get to God about him, and plead on his behalf that he may be allowed to continue, that he may be restored in his soul and continue in life.<a name=33:4></a> And then, dear brethren, if we get to God about someone else who has sinned, we shall very likely find that God will raise exercises with ourselves, and all that will be for our help, and as we face those exercises with God, we may acquire a little power and influence, and be able to save our brother.<a name=33:5></a> Indeed in Galatians, as has been much brought before our notice in recent years, it says, "If even a man be taken in some fault, ye who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness, considering thyself lest thou also be tempted.<a name=33:6></a>" The Lord places on the spiritual the responsibility of restoring one taken in a fault.<a name=33:7></a> Here John says you are to ask for him, and use your influence with God that such an one might be recovered.<a name=33:8></a> But Galatians would go further, and say <i>you</i> are to restore such an one.<a name=33:9></a> As has been said by another, if we pray for people we gain power with them.<a name=33:10></a> If we get to God about them in secret we may acquire a certain amount of moral power with them, so as to be able, like Abram, to recover our brother.<a name=33:11></a>

		I think from what I have said, dear brethren, that the importance of the brother, that is, the brotherly element, seen in sisters as well as in actual brothers, will be manifest.<a name=34:1></a> And you will remember too that Paul constantly brings in a brother.<a name=34:2></a> In writing to the Corinthians in his first epistle he says, "Paul, a called apostle of Jesus Christ by God's will, and Sosthenes the brother.<a name=34:3></a>" As an apostle he is authoritative, he brings in the mind of the Lord, and it is the Lord's commandment and it must be obeyed, but then he brings in the brother with him.<a name=34:4></a> The brother would not assert authority, but he would move about as caring for the souls of the brethren.<a name=34:5></a> So Paul always looks for the support of the ministry by the influence and power of the brother.<a name=34:6></a> And so in writing his second epistle to Corinthians he says again, "Paul, apostle of Jesus Christ by God's will, and the brother Timotheus.<a name=34:7></a>" He brings in another brother.<a name=34:8></a> And then in writing to the Corinthians too, in the first epistle he says, "Aquila and Priscilla .<a name=34:9></a>.<a name=34:10></a>.<a name=34:11></a> salute you much.<a name=34:12></a>" "Salute you <i>much</i> in the Lord," why does he say that?<a name=34:13></a> Because Aquila and Priscilla had been local brethren at Corinth at one time, and the Corinthians would know them well, and know indeed, the kind of line that they were on, and when they heard that Aquila and Priscilla, who were with Paul when he wrote his first epistle, saluted them <i>much</i> in the Lord, they would say to themselves, what is the force of that word "much"?<a name=34:14></a> And they would perhaps realise that Aquila and Priscilla were very much concerned about them, and the assembly in their house also.<a name=34:15></a> And as they began to think on those lines, they would begin to understand why they were concerned about them.<a name=34:16></a> It would just be a means of bringing home to them that not only was their condition serious in the sight of the Lord and of His servant the apostle, but this brother and sister, and the assembly in their house,

		I need not say more, dear brethren.<a name=35:3></a> All through the epistles we shall find the influence and importance of a brother.<a name=35:4></a> God has set us together as brethren, and we are brethren because we are born of God.<a name=35:5></a> We are born of God and children of God and that is what constitutes us brethren of one another, and our first responsibility, if I may say so, as children of God in the world is to express God in His nature and moral attributes.<a name=35:6></a> But then we are also a support to one another.<a name=35:7></a> The circle of the brethren is a great support to us as in a world in which we are in testimony, and in this circle we are to accept responsibility as brethren to care for one another's souls.<a name=35:8></a> And so the first brother was a shepherd.<a name=35:9></a>

		the Lord is presented in the epistle to the Hebrews, not so much in an official light, although there are official positions, including that of High Priest, referred to in the epistle: but the Lord is constantly referred to by His personal Name of <i>Jesus</i>, and that is intended to effect in us, attachment of heart to Himself personally.<a name=39:1></a> Jesus is the Name by which He is known by Christians, and it is a personal Name, involving indeed, the truth of His Person -- for the Name means, "Jehovah the Saviour" -- but it speaks of the <i>Man</i>, the Man who has won and holds the affections of those who belong to Him.<a name=39:2></a> And so we are to consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus.<a name=39:3></a> And first of all it says, He is "faithful to him that has constituted him.<a name=39:4></a>" He is faithful to God, faithful in all God's house; not as Moses was, as a ministering servant, but, as Son.<a name=39:5></a> That refers to what He is on God's behalf, that He is set over God's house as Son.<a name=39:6></a> That is, He is not a servant.<a name=39:7></a> He is the Son, and He is over God's house with all the holy and jealous affections as to what is due to God, that characterise Him as Son, and so there is One in charge of God's house, who is over it as Son.<a name=39:8></a> That ensures that nothing will be allowed to pass in the house of God, that is not suitable to God.<a name=39:9></a> Christ is over it for God's pleasure, as Son.<a name=39:10></a> But then He is also officiating in the service of God, or in relation to the things of God, as <i>Priest</i>, and that presents what He is on our side.<a name=39:11></a> As Apostle He has come out <i>from</i> God <i>to</i> us; as High Priest He has gone in on our behalf, to God.<a name=39:12></a> Both offices unite in Christ.<a name=39:13></a> Typically Moses was the apostle, and Aaron was the high priest, but when it comes to Christianity, both offices are taken up by Christ.<a name=39:14></a>

		Well now, in chapter 5, we have a further touching scripture, for it alludes to the intensity of the sufferings of Christ, and it also stresses that His being Son was one of the qualifications for His priesthood.<a name=44:8></a> In the first chapter He is presented as the Apostle, the Apostle of our confession, and the second Psalm is quoted in that connection in that chapter, "Thou art my son, I have today begotten thee.<a name=44:9></a>" That is, the Lord as the Apostle is the One who comes out from God to set out what Christianity is, what the mind of God is, and the characteristic feature of it is sonship.<a name=44:10></a> It is set out in Christ, Thou art my Son, I have today begotten Thee.<a name=44:11></a> That is the first feature of the Name that is brought out in the first chapter, and in that chapter He is presented as Apostle.<a name=44:12></a> That is, the light of God's mind for us is conveyed in Christ, and the first thought that is brought to our notice is that of sonship, "Thou art my Son, I have <i>today</i> begotten thee.<a name=44:13></a>" But now in this chapter, <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>is quoted again, but quoted

		But now I wish to pass on to speak for a moment of Melchisedec.<a name=49:3></a> When we come to chapter 7, the Spirit of God goes back to the occasion of the introduction of Melchisedec.<a name=49:4></a> Melchisedec is a mysterious personage.<a name=49:5></a> We read of him in the fourteenth of Genesis.<a name=49:6></a> He is introduced abruptly in the one incident in which he met Abram returning from the slaughter of the kings, and then we hear of him no more until David writes the 110th Psalm, and in that Psalm it is said, "Jehovah hath sworn, and will not repent, thou art priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedec.<a name=49:7></a>" And then we hear no more of him again until we come to the epistle to the Hebrews.<a name=49:8></a> And it is only in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#14">Genesis  14</a>, and <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#110">Psalm  110</a>and the epistle to the Hebrews, that Melchisedec is mentioned, and yet he is such an important personage, because he is intended to direct our attention to the Son of God, and the Son of God in the glory of His Person, as having neither beginning nor end of days, and as having now taken up priesthood according to God's will, a priesthood that is <i>never</i> going to fail, and <i>never</i> going to be surrendered, because the priesthood is now a priesthood after the order of Melchisedec, and Melchisedec represents Christ as Priest in the power of indissoluble life.<a name=49:9></a> Well now, this Melchisedec was priest of the Most High God, and as Abram returned from the slaughter of the kings, Melchisedec went out and met him with bread and wine, and said, "Blessed be Abram of the Most High God, .<a name=49:10></a>.<a name=49:11></a>.<a name=49:12></a> and blessed be the Most High God.<a name=49:13></a>" So that he typifies the Lord, not now as supporting us exactly in the presence of great pressure, but as

		supporting us in the sense that we belong to a heavenly system, and therefore we are not to become entangled with, or diverted by, anything on this earth.<a name=50:1></a> Melchisedec is presented as priest of the Most High God, and he said, "Blessed be Abram of the Most High God, possessor of heavens and earth," That is, he brought before Abram, that the possessor of the heavens and earth, the Most High God, was being served.<a name=50:2></a> There was the priest -- Melchisedec was there before Him.<a name=50:3></a> And he brought forward bread and wine to sustain Abram.<a name=50:4></a> I have very little doubt it is a veiled allusion to the Supper.<a name=50:5></a> Not that we speak of the wine in connection with the Supper, but there is a kind of veiled allusion, I believe, to the way the Lord would serve us week after week, in order to maintain in our souls the sense that we belong to a heavenly system of divine service.<a name=50:6></a> The Supper leads up to that, and it is renewed week after week, and is intended continually to remind us that we have part, through the grace of God, in the service of God in its most exalted form.<a name=50:7></a> We know God in a way that is greater and more blessed, than any other family.<a name=50:8></a> And so the Lord would sustain us in the sense of that, so that we should not be in any way entangled by what is going on around us, or in any way carried away by anything that is worldly in its nature.<a name=50:9></a> You can easily understand that Abram might have tended to be a little bit elated.<a name=50:10></a> He had taken a long journey in love for his brother, and he had won a great victory over the kings, and he had brought back his brother Lot and all the property, and the danger might be that Abram might be elated, and any of us is in danger at times of being elated: we may have served in a measure of spiritual power, but that is just the moment when we are in danger of being elated.<a name=50:11></a> The moment when spiritual power is experienced is <i>just</i> the moment when we most need support

		lest we should be elated, and as elated, give place in our minds and souls to some element of this world and of the devil, such as the element of pride and of self-satisfaction.<a name=51:1></a> So Melchisedec comes forward and gives him bread and wine, and reminds him that he, Abram, is blessed of the Most High God, Possessor of heavens and earth.<a name=51:2></a> And then Melchisedec blessed the Most High God, as though to suggest to Abram that that is what he is to be engaged in.<a name=51:3></a> He is to be engaged in the service of God.<a name=51:4></a> And the more we engage in the service of God, dear brethren, not formally, but in truth and in liberty which the Holy Spirit affords, the more we shall be preserved from any kind of element of pride or self-satisfaction or anything that is worldly, that is if we <i>truly</i> come into the presence of God.<a name=51:5></a> Of course, it is possible to engage in a form of service and not be true or in liberty in it.<a name=51:6></a> The golden calf shows that.<a name=51:7></a> The people could make a golden calf and proclaim a feast to Jehovah.<a name=51:8></a> And they danced before the golden calf and said, "This is thy god, Israel, who has brought thee up out of the land of Egypt," and yet it was a feast to Jehovah.<a name=51:9></a> So they were ostensibly engaging in the service of Jehovah, and yet what they had done was to cast the gold that they had into a mould, and their thoughts of God were in that set mould, and henceforward their service would be in just exactly the same mould, nothing living about it, and that is something that we have always to guard against.<a name=51:10></a> But the Spirit of God is the great answer to that, the great preservative.<a name=51:11></a> And so, as I say, Melchisedec supported Abram in order that he might be maintained having his part in the service of the blessed God.<a name=51:12></a>

		God worked in creation for six days, day after day, and then on the seventh day He rested and sanctified it, and called upon His people Israel later to hallow the Sabbath day in order that He might convey that while the normal thing is to work, He also cherishes the thought of rest, and would give His people to enter into rest with Him.<a name=54:4></a> So that the thought of the Sabbath goes right through Scripture.<a name=54:5></a> One of the most important references to it, in actual application to ourselves, being in the sixteenth chapter of Exodus, where the manna is given, and where we are told that they ate manna for six days; gathering it each day afresh, and then on the seventh day found none.<a name=54:6></a> Of course it was the Sabbath and God had provided on the sixth day a double amount to carry them over the seventh.<a name=54:7></a> The teaching of that is that if we habituate ourselves to feeding on manna, in connection with the ordinary responsibilities of daily life, six days feeding on manna will lead to a seventh day of rest.<a name=54:8></a> The more we accustom ourselves to feeding on manna, the more we shall find rest in our souls.<a name=54:9></a> That is the principle.<a name=54:10></a> That however much we may have to do, and God expects that His people should have plenty to do, we should learn to find rest in the middle of what we do have

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a very serious matter for any of us to ignore the governmental consequences of the ordering of God that man should work.<a name=56:8></a> "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread," it says.<a name=56:9></a> He also brought in at the same time, certain governmental consequences on the woman, and they remain until this day; but man has to work in the sweat of his brow, and that is part of God's governmental ways with man.<a name=56:10></a> Thus it is important that we should understand that it is for everyone of us to submit ourselves to it, in lowliness and subjection.<a name=56:11></a> As some of us were saying yesterday, God's ways in government always have in mind the furtherance of His ways in blessing.<a name=56:12></a> He has taken us up for blessing before the foundation of the world, and His ways with us, what He orders for us, have in mind the further promotion of the blessing which He has taken us up for, according to His purpose.<a name=56:13></a> Hence, in this passage in Thessalonians, the apostle is commending the brethren saying, that he had no need to write to them as to brotherly love, "for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.<a name=56:14></a> For also ye do this towards all the brethren in the whole of Macedonia: but we exhort you, brethren, to abound still more; and to seek

		Now before I pass on, I urge the brethren to bear in mind that there are those two kinds of work that God has ordained for man.<a name=58:6></a> I hope to speak in a moment of the more exalted kind of work, but first, there is the kind of work that comes upon us in God's governmental ways.<a name=58:7></a> The women have their governmental consequences, and of course, the women have to work too, they work in the house.<a name=58:8></a> But the men particularly have to recognise that God's government requires that they work and work hard and continuously, until the time that they come to die, if they have the ability to do so.<a name=58:9></a> There is also the more privileged and exalted kind of work.<a name=58:10></a> God placed the man in the garden to till it, and to guard it.<a name=58:11></a> Tilling would involve work.<a name=58:12></a> If, as I have no doubt, the garden of Eden is rightly regarded as a type of the assembly at the present time, as that which is intended peculiarly to afford pleasure to the heart of Christ and the heart of God; we can regard the man as placed in it, first as a type of the Lord in charge of all divine pleasure on the earth, and then also, the saints as with Him in it.<a name=58:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=67:1></a>G.<a name=67:2></a> I was thinking of the place which the Holy Spirit has, or is intended to have, in Christianity, and also that what is to be noted at the beginning and is especially emphasised in the early chapters of the Acts is that it is a question also of the whole system being characterised by Jesus in heaven.<a name=67:3></a> It is Jesus who is to give character to the whole system but the power for it is in the Holy Spirit here.<a name=67:4></a> I think Mr.<a name=67:5></a> Raven used to say, an impressive statement, that man is in heaven and God is on earth.<a name=67:6></a> And that is the truth, that Man is in heaven in the Person of Jesus and God is on earth in the Spirit, and He is on earth in order to effectuate in divine power correspondence to what is in heaven.<a name=67:7></a> And hence this first chapter stresses the Holy Spirit, and also stresses that Jesus has been taken up into heaven.<a name=67:8></a> The expression "taken up" conveys the thought of "receiving up" that is it is expressive of the delight of heaven in having Jesus there.<a name=67:9></a> Four times the Holy Spirit is mentioned in chapter one and four times the taking up of Jesus into heaven is mentioned.<a name=67:10></a> And those two great facts, I believe, are to dominate our thoughts in regard of Christianity: that Man, according to God, is in heaven, and that involves the rejection of every other man, and the Holy Spirit is personally down here in order that testimony as to God, a continuation of what was found in Jesus in the days of His flesh, should be maintained in purity and in power, and also that the service of God (not that Acts develops that much), should be maintained in spiritual power.<a name=67:11></a> Perhaps I may remark also that Luke did not write this book, of course, until defection had well set in; that is,

		Luke tells us at the end of his book that Paul was in Rome a prisoner so that he did not write the book until general departure from the truth had come in.<a name=68:1></a> But notwithstanding that he is not accepting any lowering of standard in his own mind, but by the Holy Spirit, is setting before us the true standard that obtained from the very start, and while of course we cannot look for any recovery to Pentecostal days as regards what is outward, it is the divine intention that we should have the divine standard before us, because God will never be content with anything less than the divine standard, and that where the truth is recovered, the recovery is to the original standard.<a name=68:2></a> Hence John in his first epistle insists all the way through on what was from the beginning, and really we not only get what was from the beginning in Jesus personally on earth but also in the assembly as set up at the outset.<a name=68:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		H.L.<a name=68:4></a>H.<a name=68:5></a> The first verse speaks of "all things which Jesus began both to do and to teach.<a name=68:6></a>" Is it the thought then that those things should be continued in men?<a name=68:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=68:8></a>G.<a name=68:9></a> I understand that is the thought and the doing precedes the teaching, that is, the teaching was to be the exposition of what was set out in actual life, and hence the thirty years of the Lord, as to which comparatively little is given us, that long period of thirty years of private life preceding the three and a half years of public testimony.<a name=68:10></a> At the same time in the Acts Luke is not referring to that, because he takes as his standard what came out in the three and a half years of the Lord's public testimony; he starts at the baptism of John.<a name=68:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=69:7></a>G.<a name=69:8></a> I have no doubt it would, because we get His teaching as to the kingdom during the days of His flesh, but it is to be noted that while the assembly is in view -- it says, "being assembled with them" -- it does not say that He spoke to them of the assembly but taught them concerning the kingdom of God.<a name=69:9></a> The kingdom of God really involves subjective formation by the Spirit, because the kingdom of God is the moral sway of God in the soul by the Holy Spirit.<a name=69:10></a> And that is what is so important -- formation by the Spirit of God, if the assembly is to be here according to God.<a name=69:11></a> But the first passage read brings in the prominent place the Holy Spirit is intended to have in Christianity in that it says that the Lord charged the apostles by the Holy Spirit, "Until that day in which, having by the Holy Spirit charged the apostles whom he had chosen, he was taken up," chapter 1: 2.<a name=69:12></a> And then He commands them not to depart from Jerusalem, "but to await the promise of the Father, which, said he, ye have heard of me," as though He would impress them with the fact that nothing was to be done in the way of testimony here without the Holy Spirit.<a name=69:13></a> They were to await the promise of the Father, and then He says, "For John indeed baptised with water, but ye shall be baptised with the Holy Spirit after now not many days," which introduces immediately the thought of the baptism of the Holy Spirit, involving the assembly in which the saints are merged together, to move as

		A.J.<a name=70:6></a>G.<a name=70:7></a> I think Bethany perhaps has some allusion to what was vital in Judaism.<a name=70:8></a> You get no mention of Bethany in the Acts, rather the upper room, and then Jerusalem as near to it, because what is stressed in the Acts is that there is to be testimony, and Jerusalem is first of all the sphere of testimony, the sphere of hostility but the sphere of testimony, but it is to be in the power of what is known in the mount of Olives.<a name=70:9></a> They come from the mount of Olives, and come to the upper room which is in Jerusalem, that is it is a position that is morally above the level of what is around us, sustained by what we have in the Spirit, which the mount of Olives suggests, but yet having testimony in mind.<a name=70:10></a>

		A.J.<a name=72:16></a>G.<a name=72:17></a> I do not think there is much difference.<a name=72:18></a> The note says that the word "taken" means receiving, only in an active sense.<a name=72:19></a> Later on, in the third chapter, we get, "Whom heaven indeed must receive," but that is a more passive word and has not quite the force of the word in this chapter, which is actually "taken up", but in the sense of "receiving.<a name=72:20></a>" And therefore I think it is to convey the great pleasure that heaven had in receiving Him.<a name=72:21></a> So that He was taken up, and they beheld Him taken up.<a name=72:22></a> And not only that, but the angel says to them, "This Jesus who has been taken up from you into

		A.J.<a name=74:13></a>G.<a name=74:14></a> Yes, indeed, and another thing is that as we dwell on this great fact of the Holy Spirit being with us, there is a certain danger perhaps, for flesh is very subtle, of thinking that the Holy Spirit is going to attach Himself to us, and make something of us, but He is not.<a name=74:15></a> He is going to make everything of Christ, the One who was taken up into heaven, and the apostle who was chosen was to be one who would bear witness of His resurrection.<a name=74:16></a> The fact that God has raised up Jesus from among the dead is evidence that He has set aside every other man.<a name=74:17></a> He just raised up one Man from among the dead and let the rest remain in death, you might say, and that is the clearest evidence that He has set aside every other man, and the Holy Spirit is always faithful to that, and will make it good in our own souls, if we are subject to Him.<a name=74:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=92:1></a>G.<a name=92:2></a> What is in mind in reading certain passages from the Acts is to seek to get impressions of Christianity as it was set up at the outset, involving the abiding presence of the Holy Spirit in the assembly.<a name=92:3></a> That is, one might say, the dominating feature of the dispensation, that God Himself is here in the Spirit, but it also involves, as we remarked yesterday afternoon, that the whole position is to be characterised by the fact that Man in the Person of Jesus is in heaven.<a name=92:4></a> And the intention is that what was seen in Jesus, the things which He began both to do and to teach, should be now seen in the assembly here.<a name=92:5></a> That can easily be understood, for God's thought is that He would dwell among men, as it is said, an habitation of God in the Spirit; that is what the assembly is at the present time, and if God is to dwell among men, it must be in conditions that are congenial to Him, it must be in men of the kind that He approves.<a name=92:6></a> Hence we noticed yesterday afternoon that the first chapter of the Acts has many references to Jesus as having been "taken up into heaven," four references to His "taking up" and four references to the Holy Spirit.<a name=92:7></a> And here in this opening address of Peter's after the Spirit had come, the whole burden of his address is, "This Jesus.<a name=92:8></a>" "Jesus, the Nazaraean," in verse 22, and then "This Jesus," verse 32, "has God raised up," and then again in verse 36, "God has made him, <i>this</i> Jesus whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.<a name=92:9></a>" So that Christianity was established in the light of a Man of whom God has approved, who has been cast out by the world and crucified, but raised from the dead and exalted by God.<a name=92:10></a> And then

		as it says in verse 33, "Having therefore been exalted by the right hand of God, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, He has poured out this which ye behold and hear.<a name=93:1></a>" That is, the Spirit has not come independently of Christ, but as given to Christ in exaltation by the Father for men, and poured out by Him.<a name=93:2></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#68:18">Psalm  68:18</a>, it says, "Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive: thou hast received gifts in Man, and even for the rebellious, for the dwelling there of Jah Elohim.<a name=93:3></a>" I thought perhaps we might dwell a little to start with on that great fact, and then in the other passages we have read, see how the testimony as established on earth met with opposition, as we might expect, it taking the form of threatening in chapter 4, and how that was met, and how opposition only served to bind the saints more closely together.<a name=93:4></a> And then how the enemy seeks subtly to counteract what is of God by the introduction of evil, and how fully that was met, chapter 5 serving to bring into prominence how the Spirit of God is spoken of -- the Holy Spirit, God, and the Spirit of the Lord.<a name=93:5></a> And then further, how the result of all that is an increase of holiness among the people, and complete oneness of accord with regard to the dealing with evil, holiness among the people being built up, so that "Of the rest," it says, "durst no man join them.<a name=93:6></a>" So we have in principle the great and high wall of the heavenly city in what is built up in the souls of the saints.<a name=93:7></a> And then finally, we have also the first mention, I think, in the Acts, of angelic service, and the word to the apostles, to go and stand and speak in the temple to the people, "all the words of <i>this</i> life," emphasising that it is life that God intends should be in evidence as His great testimony.<a name=93:8></a> There is the word of life in the Lord in the days of His flesh, but now it is life in the saints that is to be the great testimony.<a name=93:9></a>

		A.J.<a name=94:4></a>G.<a name=94:5></a> Very largely, I think.<a name=94:6></a> Certainly they had to wait for Paul's ministry before the heavenly side of the truth came out, only I think what is seen is that in the power of the Holy Spirit the thing was there vitally before the truth as to it really came out, which is usually God's way.<a name=94:7></a> He usually brings in a thing vitally before He gives the truth to explain what it is He has brought in.<a name=94:8></a> So, for example, with Nicodemus.<a name=94:9></a> There is no doubt that he was born anew, he is distinguished from those whom the Lord would not trust Himself to because He knew what was in man, but it says, "<i>But</i> there was a man," and he came to Jesus by night, and then the Lord speaks to him about new birth.<a name=94:10></a> There was no doubt that Nicodemus was already born anew, but he did not know it, and the Lord was really explaining to him what had come about in himself.<a name=94:11></a>

		A.J.<a name=118:5></a>G.<a name=118:6></a> Yes, I think so, he was doing that.<a name=118:7></a> That is, he was doing what Paul said later of Timothy, that he was caring with genuine feeling how the saints were getting on.<a name=118:8></a> He was following the flock, that is, seeing how they were moving, and Jehovah seeing such an one took him up and said, "Go prophesy unto my people Israel.<a name=118:9></a>" I think that is always to be borne in mind, that while there is what is sovereign and authoritative in the giving of gift, there is always room for devotedness, apart from gift.<a name=118:10></a> And devotedness under the Lord's hand will develop into spiritual ability.<a name=118:11></a>

		A.J.<a name=142:1></a>G.<a name=142:2></a> As we have only one reading left, I thought it wise not to spend time on the beginning of chapter 13, or chapter 15, although they are important passages.<a name=142:3></a> Chapter 13, as we know, telling us that there were in the assembly which was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers, and as they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.<a name=142:4></a> Then having fasted and prayed, and having laid their hands on them, they let them go," and it says, "They therefore, having been sent forth by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia," and so on.<a name=142:5></a> So that that clearly establishes what we have already said as to the Holy Spirit being presented as in charge of Christianity, and in charge of the service and those engaged publicly in the service, and also as to certain moral conditions being necessary if the Holy Spirit is to be unhindered in His activities.<a name=142:6></a> So as it says, "they were ministering to the Lord and fasting," and then, "having fasted and prayed.<a name=142:7></a>" Then chapter 15 gives us the greatest crisis in the history of the testimony, where there was a definite effort of the enemy to introduce the idea that Gentile believers must be circumcised and keep the law.<a name=142:8></a> It is what Paul referred to in his epistle to the Galatians, and chapter 15 gives us the way it was met, by the brethren coming together and patiently waiting on God in regard of the matter; dependence and patience being seen particularly in the apostles.<a name=142:9></a> It says, that after much discussion Peter stood up, as though he did not immediately take a lead, but gave time for others to express themselves and for

		the Holy Spirit to direct him what he should do or say.<a name=143:1></a> And then as was remarked this morning, he stands up and reminds the brethren of what God was doing.<a name=143:2></a> He does not read any scripture but he just reminds them of what God was doing, sovereignly, in having given the Holy Spirit to the Gentiles without any question at all of their keeping the law or being circumcised.<a name=143:3></a> And that should be sufficient for them.<a name=143:4></a> And then James stands up and confirms it by a word, quoting from Amos a scripture which I think it would be right to say in its literal interpretation looks on to the world to come; but giving it in the power of the Spirit an application to the existing exercise, and it was so living that the whole matter was settled, and when they sent a letter to the Gentile assemblies, they say, "It has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us.<a name=143:5></a>" It is a model, really, of a decision in the Spirit arrived at by quiet waiting on God.<a name=143:6></a> We see James expressing a spiritual judgment in what he said, confirming it by Scripture.<a name=143:7></a> I thought perhaps this afternoon we might look at these scriptures we read, first emphasising the need, on the part of those who are moving in the work, to move dependently and tentatively, and then chapter 20, which is most important, giving a review by the apostle of his service at Ephesus, where the Lord allowed him in his ministry to bring out all the truth.<a name=143:8></a> And he goes over it, not only emphasising that he had ministered in a constructive way, but emphasising also that he had moved in love, and places on the elders the responsibility to care for the saints and to remember the example of love which he had set.<a name=143:9></a> He commended them to God and the word of His grace, but reminded them too that the Holy Spirit Himself had set them as overseers.<a name=143:10></a> Paul is an example to us, showing that if the saints are to be built up, they must be cared for with unceasing love, and also we must be concerned as to constructive

		ministry.<a name=144:1></a> And then finally chapter 21 shows how all the saints are brought into the matter and how the Spirit is there among the brethren.<a name=144:2></a> The disciples told Paul by the Spirit not to go up to Jerusalem.<a name=144:3></a> It indicates too, I suppose, although one would speak carefully as to it, that perhaps at this particular point Paul was lacking in sensitiveness, so that he failed to discern that what they had said to him was by the Spirit.<a name=144:4></a> And hence it emphasises the great need for sensitiveness if the things of God are to be carried through, as they are being carried through in the Spirit.<a name=144:5></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=163:7></a>G.<a name=163:8></a> Well, exactly, and Peter is on the same line, it is very interesting to see that Peter and Paul, though leading apostles, are the exemplification of lowliness, and they enjoin it, so that Peter says, "Likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto the elder," and then he says, "Yea, <i>all</i> of you .<a name=163:9></a>.<a name=163:10></a>.<a name=163:11></a> be clothed with humility," elder and younger alike.<a name=163:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=163:15></a>G.<a name=163:16></a> Well, here the apostle is stressing that he had served in love, and then, while he sets himself before them as an example, in order that they should not be left with the last impressions on their minds being of Paul, he finishes by saying, "And to remember the words of the Lord Jesus that he himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.<a name=163:17></a>" It is as though, while he is emphasising the thing in himself, he does not want himself to be the last impression left on their minds.<a name=163:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=164:12></a>G.<a name=164:13></a> Yes, quite so, there is no such thought, as was remarked this morning, of apostolic succession, what we are committed to really is God, and the Holy Spirit is here, so that it says, "Take heed therefore to yourselves and to all the flock wherein the <i>Holy Spirit</i> has set you as overseers," the Spirit is in charge of the position, and if one brother who has served well as an elder is removed, the Spirit will see that the place is filled if there is exercise on the part of the saints.<a name=164:14></a> Of course, if there is carelessness and so on, He might not raise up anyone with the ability of a pastor to care.<a name=164:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=165:13></a>G.<a name=165:14></a> Well, he had just referred to the flock, of course, "Take heed unto yourselves and to all the flock" as though to emphasise that they need care, as a flock does, but then he brings forward the thought of the assembly in order to show how great the flock is, and of what value it is to God, so that he gives the elders an incentive to care for it.<a name=165:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.Me.<a name=165:16></a> In reference to verse 19, the apostle Paul had the light of the assembly of God from the beginning at his conversion, "Why persecutest thou <i>me</i>," and then here it says, "serving the Lord with all lowliness," Would serving the saints be the same as serving the Lord?<a name=165:17></a>

		A.J.<a name=168:1></a>G.<a name=168:2></a> I suppose we always need to remember, in reading the Old Testament, what is said in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#15">Romans  15</a>, that whatever things were written aforetime, were written for our learning.<a name=168:3></a> It only emphasises how great is this period, in which the assembly is being formed, that God has gone to such pains, all through Old Testament times, to work out in the lives of people and to record in His word things that are intended for <i>our</i> instruction.<a name=168:4></a> And I believe this book has a particular voice to us at the present time, having in mind the development in the saints of faithfulness to God, as seen in Mordecai, faithfulness to God and His rights, in the presence of increasing evil, and also the development in the saints of the feminine features of beauty and moral attractiveness as seen in Esther, with a view to their having power with God.<a name=168:5></a> As evil increases and the opposition to the truth increases, what God wants, I believe, is that we should have power with Him.<a name=168:6></a> He can do things and come in, if necessary, apart from the saints, but He loves to bring us into intelligent sympathy with Himself as to matters: to have His own feelings as to them, and to <i>ask</i>, the Lord making much of asking the Father in His name in <a href="../bible/John.htm#15">John  15</a>and 16.<a name=168:7></a> Mordecai is to be regarded sometimes of course, as a type of Christ Himself, but also as a type of spiritual manhood in the saints.<a name=168:8></a> So that in chapter 9, he is called the "man" Mordecai, and he became continually greater.<a name=168:9></a> Where the Spirit of God says, "the man" -- "the man Moses," or "the man Mordecai," and so on, He is stressing, I think, spiritual manhood.<a name=168:10></a> And then he is also a Jew, several times he is called <i>the</i> Jew, and I think that is to stress genuineness, according to <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#2">Romans  2</a>,

		A.J.<a name=170:6></a>G.<a name=170:7></a> That is exactly what I had in mind.<a name=170:8></a> And one has been impressed with the fact that not only did sin enter into the world, by man, but before that sin entered into the universe through the fall of Satan and his angels, and I believe the challenge that has constituted to God's throne is being taken up by God in the assembly.<a name=170:9></a> I believe He intends to secure in the assembly, in the presence of the evil, a sphere where He can see every right of His maintained and every feature that is pleasing to Him secured.<a name=170:10></a> And then, not only will He take up the challenge and meet it fully, so that He is glorified in relation to it, but by the very exercises through which these results are secured.<a name=170:11></a> He forms the vessel that has been in His mind from eternity.<a name=170:12></a> Because obviously if the assembly is to be the helpmeet for Christ she must be holy, she must have holy sensibilities and intelligence in judgment.<a name=170:13></a> No mere innocent vessel would do, she must be a holy vessel.<a name=170:14></a> And the work of formation that goes on, corresponding with the building of the woman, I believe is very largely through the exercises caused by our being in the presence of evil.<a name=170:15></a>

		and evil, and that, of course, is part of the history of the first man; but as looking at it in its typical bearing I think what one has said is borne out by the fact that it says in verse 15, that "Jehovah Elohim took Man, and put him into the garden of Eden to till it and to <i>guard</i> it," showing that there was the necessity for guarding, and God introduced that thought of guarding.<a name=217:1></a> I think the more we consider this thought of the garden that we shall see that what I have suggested is just.<a name=217:2></a> The garden is a limited sphere peculiarly for the pleasure of the one to whom it belongs; Eden itself means pleasure, that is, I take it, that the idea in Eden is the great principle that all that God has created was created for His pleasure.<a name=217:3></a> He has a right to secure pleasure for Himself in it.<a name=217:4></a> But then that has been invaded, as one said, but in the presence of the invasion of it God has secured a garden in Eden, that is, He will secure and maintain a limited sphere on the earth in the presence of evil, so that all that is according to His mind should be there for His pleasure.<a name=217:5></a> And He entrusts Man, that is, in the first place, Christ, you might say, but then ourselves, as formed after Christ, He entrusts us with the responsibility of guarding it.<a name=217:6></a> And that comes in before we get the other type, which comes in in the later part of the chapter, which refers not to the assembly in the position of responsibility here, but to the assembly according to the purpose of God.<a name=217:7></a> I think that is borne out by the fact that in the Acts of the Apostles, the apostle is brought to Corinth where the truth of the assembly in responsibility was developed before he went to Ephesus where the truth of the assembly in relation to divine counsels was developed.<a name=217:8></a> And I think one can see, that it is morally right that God should take up and solve the challenge that the introduction of evil into the universe has raised before He makes known what was in His eternal purpose.<a name=217:9></a> And the very exercises

		A.J.<a name=246:10></a>G.<a name=246:11></a> Well, one does not want in any way to convey an impression of laying down things in a demanding way, so that as you say it is three days.<a name=246:12></a> Fasting really, I think, is what we take up spontaneously as feeling the urgency of the thing, not exactly something that is laid down that we must do.<a name=246:13></a> But on the other hand fasting is made much of here.<a name=246:14></a> We read that the Lord said in one case, "This kind does not go out but by prayer and fasting.<a name=246:15></a>" And then it says in regard of the sending out of Barnabas and Saul, "Having fasted and prayed, and having laid their hands on them, they let them go.<a name=246:16></a>" And earlier, before that, it says that "they were ministering to the Lord and fasting.<a name=246:17></a>" This all shews that fasting had a good deal of place in the early days.<a name=246:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=249:10></a>G.<a name=249:11></a> Well, the more we see things as God sees them, and the more we see how the saints suffer or are threatened with suffering as a result of the enemy's movements, the more, I think, we shall develop in these feelings.<a name=249:12></a> The first thing is to be marked increasingly by praying for the saints, praying for all saints and praying intelligently, not simply praying in a general way that God will bless all His people but taking up with God the exercises that His people are confronted with.<a name=249:13></a> That will help develop us in the feelings.<a name=249:14></a>

		A.J.<a name=250:17></a>G.<a name=250:18></a> Well, quite so, and I think it is a question of our understanding that while we have in the Holy Spirit great liberty with God and have title to go in to God at any time, God looks for certain moral conditions.<a name=250:19></a> So that it says in the Psalm that if I have iniquity in my heart God will not hear me.<a name=250:20></a> It is no use my saying, I am a believer and I have the Spirit and I can draw near to God, if I am allowing iniquity in my heart God will not hear me.<a name=250:21></a> That is the law, you might say.<a name=250:22></a>

		M.S.<a name=272:8></a>S.<a name=272:9></a> Would you say there was a general similarity here with what you get in the beginning of Revelation in the Lord's word to the assemblies, that Samuel was in the position of an overcomer?<a name=272:10></a> I was thinking particularly of this word to Eli in verse 27 of chapter 2, meanwhile the Lord in His addresses in Revelation is bringing home to the responsible element the fact that they were implicated.<a name=272:11></a> Eli was responsible, in spite of the fact that he had spoken to his sons, yet he still remained responsible.<a name=272:12></a> Then over against that Samuel representing the overcomer.<a name=272:13></a>

		A.J.<a name=275:10></a>G.<a name=275:11></a> Well, "Jehovah revealed himself to Samuel at Shiloh by the word of Jehovah," that is, it was not simply one communication but now he was becoming recognised, and God Himself was recognising him as a means of communication between God and His people.<a name=275:12></a>

		A.J.<a name=284:1></a>G.<a name=284:2></a> It has often been said that this part of Luke's gospel has in mind the conditions found in local gatherings.<a name=284:3></a> The chapter begins with the Lord sending out seventy, which is a hint of Paul's ministry, that is, it is something additional to the ministry of the twelve and bringing in greater spiritual fulness, and the ministry was to take shape in places.<a name=284:4></a> So that it speaks of every city and place where He Himself was about to come.<a name=284:5></a> So it helps, I think, to read this passage in that light, that the Lord has in mind the conditions that He would find in localities.<a name=284:6></a> That is that, first of all there is joy in the consciousness of being heavenly, and in the sovereignty of the Father.<a name=284:7></a> Whatever measure of blessing or power connected with the Lord's name might be proved, the great thing is to be kept in the sense that we are heavenly, and our names are written there; and that leads the Lord to introduce the thought of what we speak of as the economy, at least to suggest it.<a name=284:8></a> The response to God in any locality is to be in the sense and enjoyment of the glory of divine grace, all that lies in the sovereignty of the Father.<a name=284:9></a> And then the parable of the good Samaritan is, of course, intended to emphasize that the spirit of care, in the Spirit of Christ, must be found in each locality, involving love that can increase more and more.<a name=284:10></a> As the Samaritan says, "Whatsoever thou spendest <i>more</i>," as though no limit is placed on the expenditure of love.<a name=284:11></a> And then in Mary, of course, we have the feature of the desire to acquire spiritual intelligence, as characteristically sitting at the feet of Jesus.<a name=284:12></a> I thought we might be helped together as considering the scripture on those lines.<a name=284:13></a> The seventy are somewhat elated, or at any rate, rejoice in the experience that even the demons

		A.J.<a name=285:5></a>G.<a name=285:6></a> Yes.<a name=285:7></a> It was what was additional to the ministry of the twelve, and the seventy is a suggestion, I suppose, of great spiritual fulness.<a name=285:8></a> So that Luke, as we know, was a great adherent of Paul and imbibed his ministry, and supports it in <i>his</i> ministry, so there is a hint in the sending out of the seventy of Paul's ministry which was to take shape in cities and places.<a name=285:9></a>

		A.J.<a name=285:13></a>G.<a name=285:14></a> Well, every place is not a city, of course, but it is to take shape in localities.<a name=285:15></a> Some of those localities may be cities, that is, centres of population and centres of human wickedness, but God would have His testimony even in such places.<a name=285:16></a>

		A.J.<a name=308:1></a>G.<a name=308:2></a> I suppose what the Lord says about the Comforter, the Spirit of truth, in verse 13 of chapter 16 of John's gospel, is one of the most important statements regarding His presence with us, that is that He is here to guide us into <i>all</i> the truth, the idea of guiding involving that we do not get into all the truth all at once, but are led from one point to another in the apprehension of it.<a name=308:3></a> But the presence of the Spirit here with the saints has in mind that all the saints should move together.<a name=308:4></a> That is, the divine thought is that the whole assembly should be led into the truth -- <i>all</i> the truth.<a name=308:5></a> And I think that is suggested typically in the scripture in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#9">Numbers  9</a>, where you have the whole of God's people contemplated as constantly in movement, but in movement with periods in between when they were stationary.<a name=308:6></a> That is, there was movement and then an encampment and then a further movement and a further encampment, and so on.<a name=308:7></a> And each time they encamped the tabernacle had to be set up so that God could be served according to His requirement, and then it had to be taken down when they moved and set up again in a new position, the same tabernacle but in a new light.<a name=308:8></a> And the tabernacle system is really a type of the whole system of truth in relation to which God has come out, and in relation to which His people are to serve Him; and hence, every time there was movement on the part of the cloud the whole position had to be taken down and then it had to be set up again, exactly the same system of truth, the same tabernacle with all its parts, but in a new light, in a new position.<a name=308:9></a> And I think all that is typical of the way the Spirit of truth guides into all the truth.<a name=308:10></a> The cloud, it says, covered the tabernacle of the tent of testimony, the

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=309:8></a>G.<a name=309:9></a> It would be the result of that.<a name=309:10></a> That is, the movement of the cloud involves the opening up of some fresh feature of the truth, and then as the result of that the whole system has to be recast in our minds as affected by that new feature of the truth that has been brought out.<a name=309:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=313:21></a>G.<a name=313:22></a> I think the movement of the cloud would constitute the commandment to the people, but then in <a href="../bible/John.htm#16">John  16</a>we find that the Spirit "shall not speak from himself," so that He Himself is under command.<a name=313:23></a> "Whatsoever he shall hear he shall speak.<a name=313:24></a>" The Lord ministered on the same principle according to the twelfth of John, He says, "<i>I</i> have not spoken from myself, but the Father who sent me has himself given me commandment what I should say and what

		A.J.<a name=316:3></a>G.<a name=316:4></a> Yes, I think so.<a name=316:5></a> Take the truth as to the sonship of Christ, when that was clarified for us, it greatly enlarged our outlook as to the way God had come out in revelation and the relatively subordinate place that the Son and also the Spirit had taken with a view to the revelation, and to respond to it, and at the same time it greatly increased our appreciation of the personal glory of Christ; but it had a great effect upon our outlook upon the truth.<a name=316:6></a> And so I am sure, as we apprehend what the Lord has in mind in the present stressing of the Holy Spirit, we shall find that that, too, will have a great effect upon the service of God, not merely as to personally addressing the Spirit, although that, I have no doubt whatever, has a place in it, but I believe more particularly in the definite recognition of the Spirit at every part of the service, as giving His own character of freshness to it.<a name=316:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=323:11></a>G.<a name=323:12></a> It is easy to use such expressions, but it may be they do not convey much sometimes, but in the tenth of Acts we read that "As Peter continued pondering over the vision, the <i>Spirit</i> said to him.<a name=323:13></a>" And then in the eleventh of Acts, when Peter is himself recounting it, <i>he</i> says, "The <i>Spirit</i> said to me.<a name=323:14></a>" He did not say, The <i>Lord</i> said to me, he said The <i>Spirit</i> said to me.<a name=323:15></a> You might say to Peter, How do you know it was the Spirit and not the Lord?<a name=323:16></a> Well, I do not know what Peter would have told you if you had asked him, but he knew.<a name=323:17></a> He was able to recognise whether it was the Spirit speaking to him or whether it was the Lord speaking to him.<a name=323:18></a> And all I can say is, if we want to develop in the ability to recognise the Spirit's voice, we must get to the Lord about it and get to the Spirit about it, and I am sure They will help us, that is all I can say.<a name=323:19></a> It involves sensitiveness, as we have often said, of the Spirit's presence, and that involves that we do not allow things that we know are displeasing to Him, "Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God.<a name=323:20></a>"

		A.J.<a name=332:1></a>G.<a name=332:2></a> What one had in mind was that these scriptures give us the thought of stability individually, so that we are not overcome by any principles or influences of evil, and then, invulnerability in connection with the assembly in chapter 16.<a name=332:3></a> It is clear that chapter 16 contemplates that Satan will be opposed to the assembly all the time, and opposed to it with all the resources of counsel and wisdom that he can draw upon, hades' gates, I suppose, conveying some such idea as that, but the Lord says that He will build His assembly, "on this rock," "and hades' gates shall not prevail against it.<a name=332:4></a>" But, in point of fact, we need to be built up in moral stability if Satan is to gain no advantage, and hence chapters 5, 6 and 7 of Matthew are so important because they indicate the lines on which we may be built up in moral stability.<a name=332:5></a> So that at the end of chapter 7, the Lord says, "Whoever therefore hears these my words and does them, I will liken him to a prudent man, who built his house upon the rock and the rain came down, and the streams came, and the winds blew" and so on, "and it did not fall, for it had been founded upon the rock.<a name=332:6></a>" In contrast to that, one who does not do the Lord's words is likened to a foolish man who built on the sand.<a name=332:7></a> Hence we need to pay great attention to chapters 5, 6 and 7 of Matthew because they establish the lines on which we can be built up as morally stable.<a name=332:8></a> And that is essential if we are to fill our place in the testimony, and in the service of God, too, in the assembly.<a name=332:9></a> Otherwise we expose ourselves to the enemy and become the means of allowing him to get in in relation to the assembly.<a name=332:10></a> One could only read selected passages, of course, from chapters 5, 6 and 7, because they are long

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=357:1></a>G.<a name=357:2></a> It is clear that this chapter leads us to the full thought of Christian privilege indicated in the message which the Lord sent to the disciples by Mary, and I thought the Lord might help us to see the way that the truth has gradually been opened up, for that, I think, is what the chapter develops.<a name=357:3></a> The end of chapter 19 shows that there is a public position taken up in fidelity to the Lord, certain women standing by the cross of Jesus, and too, in Joseph and Nicodemus committed, you might say, to the fellowship of His death.<a name=357:4></a> So a public position is established in fidelity to Christ.<a name=357:5></a> But now in chapter 20 we have Mary Magdalene brought forward as a central figure, evidently possessing the feature of affection for Christ that is not satisfied with mere truth, however precious the truth, but is attached to Christ personally.<a name=357:6></a> And that is really what is to be developed in the assembly, and becomes the secret of entrance into the greatest privileges, because we enter into our greatest privileges with Christ, and in no other way.<a name=357:7></a> So the chapter starts with early morn while it is yet dark.<a name=357:8></a> That is, that there is an absence of light, but the light is gradually going to increase, and what is to be noted is that at the outset great attention is paid to the tomb, that is to the death of Christ, and as there is continual occupation with His death, the import of it and the glory to be apprehended in connection with it increases.<a name=357:9></a> But then there comes a point when the Person of Christ becomes, as it were, a necessity, to Mary Magdalene, and it is then that the whole truth is opened up.<a name=357:10></a> It is well that we should be established in fundamentals in regard of the death of Christ, so that we might be led on to an appreciation of who it is that has lain in death and what was in

		mind in His having lain there, and risen again.<a name=358:1></a> The stone taken away from the tomb was what Mary Magdalene saw as she arrived, which evidently meant that liberty was being given to look into the matter of the tomb.<a name=358:2></a> That is, the truth was going to be made clear as to all that might be apprehended as the fact of the Son of God having died is contemplated.<a name=358:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.N.<a name=358:4></a> What is involved in the fundamentals you referred to?<a name=358:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=358:6></a>G.<a name=358:7></a> Well, we read that Mary goes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and as a result they run to the tomb, and it says, "The two ran together, and the other disciple ran forward faster than Peter, and came first to the tomb, and stooping down he sees the linen cloths lying.<a name=358:8></a>" That was the first thing he saw, the first apprehension of the death of Christ -- the linen cloths lying.<a name=358:9></a> I think that is a testimony to righteousness established.<a name=358:10></a> Linen is always that in scripture, and that is the first thing.<a name=358:11></a> So that if there is to be anything built up in the way of the service of God in our souls, we have first to see how God has come in in Christ to establish a basis in righteousness on which He can work out His thoughts.<a name=358:12></a> So the first thing he saw was the linen cloths lying, but it says, he did not go in.<a name=358:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.T.<a name=358:14></a> Would you say there are features of energy seen here in both Mary and the disciples?<a name=358:15></a>
	</div>

		A.J.<a name=358:16></a>G.<a name=358:17></a> Yes, I would think so, and that is another thing which comes out.<a name=358:18></a> We are told that these two disciples ran together but one ran faster than the other, and then on the other hand, the other when he did arrive, went in further than the one.<a name=358:19></a> So that it is just to indicate that we find that kind of thing in the assembly; that some seem to be able to embrace the truth more quickly than others, others may go into it more deeply, but we have to go on together, that is the great thing.<a name=358:20></a>

		A.Y.<a name=361:2></a> Speaking of Mary, would you say that there is a certain amount of spiritual sensitiveness that marks Mary in her waiting, so that as she waits she gets at once a sight of the Lord Himself, and then gets a further unfolding of the truth in having the message to take to the disciples?<a name=361:3></a>

		A.J.<a name=398:15></a>G.<a name=398:16></a> She became his wife, that is the thought of union.<a name=398:17></a> The idea of a wife is that she has been united to her husband and henceforth she is one with him, so she is thoroughly with him in all his interests.<a name=398:18></a> And that is what is so important in the assembly, that we are brought, by the Spirit, to the point of conscious union with Christ, and then it is a simple matter to have part in the service of God, because paramount before the heart of Christ is that His Father should be served, and He wants the assembly with Him in it.<a name=398:19></a>

		A.J.<a name=409:1></a>G.<a name=409:2></a> In the twenty-fourth chapter as we had last week, Isaac is, of course, a type of Christ, but in this chapter Isaac typifies the believer as having been called with a heavenly calling, and as here in testimony in the midst of influences that would tend to rob him of his true character, as heavenly.<a name=409:3></a> And therefore it is a question of Isaac knowing how to get the full gain of what God had given him, and to move here consistently with it.<a name=409:4></a> The chapter opens with the thought of a famine, and that becomes a test.<a name=409:5></a> A famine becomes the occasion for God to tell him not go down to Egypt.<a name=409:6></a> His father before him had done that, on the occasion of the previous famine and there had been sorrowful consequences.<a name=409:7></a> So here, Jehovah warns Isaac not to go down to Egypt but to dwell in the land.<a name=409:8></a> He says, "Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee and bless thee.<a name=409:9></a>" So that Egypt is the first thing that has to be overcome or refused by Isaac, and he obeys the divine injunction; and from that time onwards it is a question of the Philistine and the influences of the Philistine that have to be overcome by Isaac.<a name=409:10></a> There might be a famine in our own souls, that is to say, a lack of spiritual food and nourishment, and that becomes a test as to whether we are going to resort to what is in character, Egypt, or whether we are going to come under the influence of what is in character, Philistine.<a name=409:11></a> Egypt is not Sodom and it is not Babylon.<a name=409:12></a> There are three great outstanding types of the world in scripture: Sodom and Egypt and Babylon.<a name=409:13></a> Sodom is the world as marked by gross evil, and Babylon is the religious world in which man can glory and obtain glory, but Egypt is just the world as a system where man lives to himself and
