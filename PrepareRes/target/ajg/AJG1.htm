		I feel impressed, dear brethren, I trust by the Lord, to say a word as to godliness, or piety, believing that there is great need of our being reminded of the importance of it.<a name=1:1></a> The Lord is bringing before us in these days much that is connected with the greatest truths of Christianity, the highest privileges of the assembly, intending that we should have power to move into these things, and that requires spirituality; but I believe that before we can be spiritual, we must become marked by righteousness practically, and piety.<a name=1:2></a> You will remember that the Scripture speaks of Simeon in the second chapter of Luke's gospel; how the Holy Spirit was upon him and that it had been revealed to him by the Spirit that he should not see death till he had seen the Lord's Christ; and how he came in the Spirit into the temple.<a name=1:3></a> He was one who was evidently characterised in large measure by spirituality, by being spiritual.<a name=1:4></a> But before saying these things about him, it says that he was just and pious, meaning that he was characteristically righteous practically in all his ways and that he was pious; and I believe those two things, practical righteousness and piety, are essential foundations to spirituality.<a name=1:5></a> That is, unless we are concerned and helped of the Lord to maintain righteousness practically in every detail of life and to cultivate piety, we shall not be able to go very far in the way of spirituality.<a name=1:6></a> The Lord is stressing, dear brethren, that the recovery of the truth which we are now enjoying -- truth that the Lord has given to the assembly now for the past hundred years -- has in mind that all the thoughts of God, the best thoughts regarding the assembly, should be entered

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		upon by us at the close just before we are taken to be with the Lord.<a name=2:1></a> But I say again, and I believe it is incontrovertible, that we cannot in any real power touch spiritual things unless there is a foundation with us of practical righteousness and piety.<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this first epistle to Timothy says much about piety.<a name=2:3></a> If you read through the epistle, I think you will be perhaps surprised at the constant references to piety, or godliness as it is rendered in the Authorised Version.<a name=2:4></a> In chapter 2 the apostle exhorts first of all that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgiving should be made for all men, for kings and those who are in authority, that we may lead quiet and peaceable lives, in all piety and gravity.<a name=2:5></a> It was a prominent thought in the mind of the apostle, so that he gives exhortation <i>first of all</i>, and with a view to this, that we may lead quiet and peaceable lives, in all piety and gravity; for, he says, "this is good and acceptable in the sight of our Saviour God, who will have all men to be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth.<a name=2:6></a>" I believe the force is, dear brethren, that not only are we ourselves to be marked by piety and the blessing that flows from it, but the result of it is to be a testimony to others that saints who are marked by piety are manifestly in the good of salvation.<a name=2:7></a> God wants all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth, enjoying all the truth, involving the knowledge of God; and there is nothing like the knowledge of God to save us practically from all the different features that are current in the world around.<a name=2:8></a> Take discontent for instance; a great feature of the present time is discontent and many things of that kind, that characterise men at the present time.<a name=2:9></a> The great power for salvation from things of that sort is the knowledge of God, and piety brings the knowledge of God into our everyday circumstances; so that we are encouraged to prayer and supplication,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=3>[Page 3]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		intercession and thanksgiving.<a name=3:1></a> All these are things that belong to the knowledge of God; indeed intercession is a wonderful privilege; it is the exercise by those who know God of their privilege of drawing near to God, it is the privilege of exercising that power on behalf of others.<a name=3:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Abraham, who is spoken of as the friend of God, took up the attitude of intercession with God in regard of Sodom.<a name=3:3></a> What a wonderful privilege, that one man outside of those wicked cities, should exercise the power he had with God, as God's friend, in intercession on behalf of Sodom and Gomorrah!<a name=3:4></a> and yet not doing it in any sentimental way, but doing it with a right sense of what was due to God, having the knowledge of God.<a name=3:5></a> So that he says, "There are perhaps fifty righteous within the city.<a name=3:6></a>" And God says, "If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.<a name=3:7></a>" And then Abraham comes down to forty-five, forty, and thirty, speaking in a becoming way, saying he was but dust and ashes, thus showing what a low sense he had of himself; for, like Job who repented in dust and ashes, Abraham had to do with God.<a name=3:8></a> He himself was but dust and ashes, and yet what power he had with God.<a name=3:9></a> He came down to twenty and he came down to ten, but he did not go below ten.<a name=3:10></a> That is to say, while he was thoroughly with God as discerning that men should be saved, yet at the same time he had a right sense of what was due to God, that if a city was so wicked that there were not even ten righteous in it, then it was not suitable to pray for its salvation, it should be judged.<a name=3:11></a> Both Sodom and Gomorrah had to be judged, yet at the same time all that was due to God was maintained by Abraham in the way he interceded.<a name=3:12></a> There is great need for that at the present time, for there is no question but that evil is increasing by leaps and bounds in the world.<a name=3:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Government, which is of God, is increasingly insecure in every country, and therefore the urgent need on the part of the saints is, that we should give ourselves to this kind of prayer, praying on behalf of all men and praying for the support of the government; praying without any political bias at all for whatever authority God has established.<a name=4:1></a> We are to pray for it because abstractly it is of God and it has in mind the maintenance of what is right and the repression of what is evil: These are things that the saints do well to pray for, that we should be able indeed to lead quiet and tranquil lives in all piety and gravity.<a name=4:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Piety has the effect of saving the saints from every kind of bitterness of spirit, discontent, and anxiety.<a name=4:3></a> All these things that more and more characterise the world, and along with that the grasping after being rich with some.<a name=4:4></a> All these things are cured, or rather we ourselves are saved from them by piety.<a name=4:5></a> Piety is that we know God and we bring the knowledge we have of God in a practical way into our every-day circumstances.<a name=4:6></a> And so the apostle says that "the mystery of piety is great," but before this he speaks of how we should behave ourselves in the house of God which is the assembly of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth.<a name=4:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I say, for the sake of any who may be unaware of it, that we are always the house of God.<a name=4:8></a> The house of God is not simply when we are together.<a name=4:9></a> Bear that in mind.<a name=4:10></a> Let the young ones especially bear this in mind, but every one of us, that we are not the house of God simply when we are together.<a name=4:11></a> We are always the house of God by virtue of the fact that God is dwelling with us by the Spirit and therefore, this question as to how we are to behave ourselves in the house of God is a matter that affects us every day and every hour of the day, when we are by ourselves, just as much as when we are together with the saints.<a name=4:12></a> It is a question of the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		kind of behaviour that is suitable to God in His dwelling place, and we are His dwelling place by virtue of the fact that God dwells in us by the Holy Spirit.<a name=5:1></a> Thus not only is there this question of suitable behaviour in the house of God, because we are the house of God, but there is also the fact that the house of God is the assembly of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth.<a name=5:2></a> The assembly has a place in the testimony as the great testimony to and support of the truth.<a name=5:3></a> Hence you can see how sorrowful it is if anyone of us in any way, by his conduct, acts unbecomingly to God and His house.<a name=5:4></a> Not only is it an affront to God personally, but it brings the name of God into disrepute.<a name=5:5></a> The testimony of the truth is bound up with it and hence we can see how important a matter it is, this question of how we behave ourselves in the house of God.<a name=5:6></a> And this involves the practical exercise of piety.<a name=5:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, the apostle says, that "great is the mystery of piety," and great it is indeed.<a name=5:8></a> God, he says, has been manifest in flesh, that is God Himself in the person of Jesus has entered into the ordinary circumstances of human life.<a name=5:9></a> Wonderful fact!<a name=5:10></a> How did He conduct Himself when He entered into the ordinary circumstances of life?<a name=5:11></a> What principle of life, so to speak, was set forth in the Lord Jesus, as having come into the ordinary circumstances of human life?<a name=5:12></a> Because that is what piety is, it is bringing God into the ordinary circumstances of human life.<a name=5:13></a> God Himself in the person of Jesus entered into those circumstances.<a name=5:14></a> According to what principle did the Lord Jesus move in these circumstances, having come in as a Man?<a name=5:15></a> He moved as characterised by unswerving confidence in God and unfailing satisfaction with the circumstances which God ordered for Him.<a name=5:16></a> They were not such as the natural man would choose, to be laid in a manger when born, to be brought up in Nazareth,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=6>[Page 6]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		a despised city.<a name=6:1></a> His reputed father a carpenter, and He Himself working as a carpenter.<a name=6:2></a> All these are not things that appeal to the natural man, they are not the kind of thing that the natural man would grasp after, and yet that is what was brought into expression in this world when God, in wonderful grace, deigned to enter in the person of Jesus into the circumstances of human life.<a name=6:3></a> He glorified God in the way He went through life, finding His confidence in God, doing the will of God, finding His satisfaction in God's will.<a name=6:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the spirit of the Psalmist Jesus could say, "The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places, yea I have a goodly heritage.<a name=6:5></a>" The goodly heritage was what He found in God, in the circumstances which God had ordered for Him, and He moved through on that principle; and even though His pathway led to death.<a name=6:6></a> He could enter into death in confidence in God, saying, "thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.<a name=6:7></a> Thou wilt show me the path of life," <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16">Psalm  16</a>.<a name=6:8></a> "Great is the mystery of godliness.<a name=6:9></a>" We are to contemplate the way God has come into human circumstances in the person of Jesus and how in these circumstances was set out the true principle of life for men in obedience to God, in confidence in God, in finding satisfaction in God.<a name=6:10></a> We shall prove it, dear brethren, if we lay ourselves out for these things.<a name=6:11></a> We shall prove that the knowledge of God is the great thing that abides and gives us peace and rest of mind and heart, so that you can come through whatever circumstances are ordered in the sense that God is with you and that you are with God, as it says "The God of love and peace be with you.<a name=6:12></a>" And so it says, "Great is the mystery of godliness.<a name=6:13></a> God has been manifested in flesh, has been justified in the Spirit.<a name=6:14></a>" There was nothing outwardly to vindicate the Lord Jesus, but He was
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=7>[Page 7]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		justified in the Spirit.<a name=7:1></a> There was undeniable power about His movements, and there is a certain measure of power about our movements if we go on in that simplicity of piety which lies in bringing God into every circumstance of our life.<a name=7:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will remember how touchingly the piety of the Lord Jesus is referred to in the epistle to the Hebrews, chapter 5, "who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up supplications and prayers with strong crying and tears unto him who was able to save him out of death.<a name=7:3></a>" The Lord did not go through circumstances in any stoical or unfeeling way.<a name=7:4></a> The circumstances that God ordered for Him were such that they called forth from Him strong crying and tears, and then it says, "having been heard because of his piety; though he were Son, he learned obedience from the things which he suffered.<a name=7:5></a>" He moved on that principle, learning what was an entirely new thing for Him, for in the form of God obedience did not attach to Him, but having entered into human conditions.<a name=7:6></a> He entered into a condition to which obedience applied, and He filled out the principle of obedience to the full in a most absolute way, "having been heard on account of his piety.<a name=7:7></a>" See the link, the affinity between our souls and Christ, as we move on that principle of obedience.<a name=7:8></a> He has "become the author of eternal salvation to all those who obey him.<a name=7:9></a>" It is as we are characterised by obedience and have the principle of it in every detail of our life, that we get the full gain and support of the priesthood of Christ.<a name=7:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 4 we have the apostle referring to such a simple thing as the matter of our food, what we eat, and he says "every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected; being received with thanksgiving; for it is sanctified by the word of God and freely addressing him.<a name=7:11></a>" One often wonders whether we are in danger sometimes of becoming
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=8>[Page 8]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		careless and set and formal in our thanksgiving at meals, for it becomes an occasion of having to do with God.<a name=8:1></a> The very food we eat is sanctified by the word of God and our freely addressing Him.<a name=8:2></a> Every time we eat, it becomes an occasion for the heart to go out to the blessed God, our freely addressing Him.<a name=8:3></a> Think of the liberty into which we have been brought as His beloved children, and every meal becomes an occasion for us to receive it from the hands of the living and blessed God and address Him freely in a spirit of thanksgiving.<a name=8:4></a> How important are the little details of human life, becoming an occasion for us to have to do with God in a living way and to become deepened thus in the knowledge of God.<a name=8:5></a> Of course, the knowledge of God brings its own exercises because of what He is.<a name=8:6></a> Our God, it says, is a consuming fire; we have to face that.<a name=8:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God intends that we should become partakers of His holiness.<a name=8:8></a> How should we ever be at liberty with Him, if we do not become partakers of His holiness?<a name=8:9></a> He intends that the very exercises and circumstances of human life, as taken up by us with Him, should serve to develop us with a view to our becoming partakers of His holiness.<a name=8:10></a> Think of that!<a name=8:11></a> So that we might be completely at home in the presence of the blessed God.<a name=8:12></a> Hence even the ordinary meal, and they recur three or four times every day in our life, each ordinary meal becomes an occasion for turning to God, not in any formal way, but as having to do with the living God.<a name=8:13></a> It says the food is sanctified by the word of God and our freely addressing Him.<a name=8:14></a> And then the apostle goes on to say we are to "refuse profane and old wives' fables and exercise ourselves to godliness.<a name=8:15></a>" That is, allow it to develop with us and have scope with us.<a name=8:16></a> To be practical in these things means not allowing anything in our lives that is inconsistent with the knowledge of the blessed God.<a name=8:17></a> In all these things we shall develop strength,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		first moral and then spiritual, as growing by and increasing in the true knowledge of God.<a name=9:1></a> So he says "bodily exercise profiteth little, but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come," and the apostle goes on to say that he himself and his fellow workers were putting things to the test.<a name=9:2></a> He says, "For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.<a name=9:3></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 6 he brings in the thought of practical contentment.<a name=9:4></a> What a thing that is, dear brethren, in a world such as this is!<a name=9:5></a> We all know how testing conditions in the world are, and they are likely to be more so rather than less.<a name=9:6></a> How easy it is for us to become in our spirits irritated, or discontented, or anxious, restless, and all that kind of thing, beloved brethren.<a name=9:7></a> This is dishonouring to God, it is as though God were not to be trusted or were not sufficient.<a name=9:8></a> See how important piety is in these practical matters, not only for our own blessing and our own comfort, but as a testimony in the world that there is something that is greater than all the trouble in it, the knowledge of God; something which has power to save people from all the discontent, bitterness of spirit and restlessness that are found marking the world.<a name=9:9></a> There is something that can practically save us from it -- the knowledge of God, and bringing this in in a practical way to bear on our every circumstance here.<a name=9:10></a> The apostle speaks of some who regard godliness as the means for gain, as though material gain were to be pursued, but he says, "godliness with contentment is great gain.<a name=9:11></a> For we brought nothing into this world and it is certain we can carry nothing out.<a name=9:12></a>" Mr.<a name=9:13></a> Raven used to say (he was very fond of referring to this verse, he was constantly bringing it in) the one thing that we can carry out of the world is the knowledge of
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God, and that is what stands us in good stead at the present time.<a name=10:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I venture to say this, as impressed by the Lord with it.<a name=10:2></a> One great thing that we all need is to cultivate and devote ourselves to piety; that is, the knowledge of God and bringing it in practically to the circumstances of our every-day life.<a name=10:3></a> This will provide a moral basis in our souls on which the Lord can build up spirituality, but if we attempt to move into the higher spiritual side of our blessing without moral foundation of practical righteousness and piety, I believe we shall find that we cannot do it.<a name=10:4></a>

		What is in mind, dear brethren, is to show that God has now brought in and is engaged with spiritual and heavenly things.<a name=11:1></a> We have been called to have part in them and, thank God, He uses the circumstances of the present time, wilderness experiences, to develop in us what is spiritual.<a name=11:2></a> It says in the first chapter of the epistle to the Ephesians, in that passage we know so well, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ.<a name=11:3></a>" We are to understand at the outset that our blessings are spiritual and not natural, and that the location of them is in the heavenlies and not on earth.<a name=11:4></a> That is readily understood as we take account of the fact that Christ has gone on high and the Spirit has come; Christ having gone on high into the presence of God, heaven has been opened up to us, and the Spirit having come, the day of what is spiritual has come in.<a name=11:5></a> There is a great tendency with us to cling to what is earthly and natural, but it is good to see from the Scriptures that what is earthly and natural has never been the final thought before the mind of God.<a name=11:6></a> The earthly and the natural things were brought in in His ways as a testimony to heavenly and spiritual things.<a name=11:7></a> Not that there will not be blessing on the earth in a coming day, for there will; indeed, even in eternity there will be a new earth as well as a new heaven, as though God has indicated that He takes pleasure in different spheres and different degrees of blessing.<a name=11:8></a> But that being so, it is well for us to understand that in the sovereignty of God and the love of God, we have been taken up for the very best.<a name=11:9></a> You may not be able to say why; that is a matter that lies in God's sovereignty.<a name=11:10></a> He

		works according to the good pleasure of His will, but there it is, that He has been pleased to choose us in Christ before the foundation of the world for the very best, for heavenly things and spiritual things.<a name=12:1></a> God Himself being a Spirit; that is, He intends to bring us into the closest affinity with Himself.<a name=12:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God has not only made known His thoughts, but Christ, having gone on high in virtue of accomplished redemption, has the right to give us by the Holy Spirit to enjoy His own love and to understand that we are to share with Him as Man in a way that saints of no other dispensation will ever do.<a name=12:3></a> I say, that position having come about, Christ having gone on high and the Spirit having already come, you can understand that God wishes us to take an interest in heavenly and spiritual things, and that we should lay ourselves out to enter into them, and not allow ourselves to be detained by worldly things or even natural things.<a name=12:4></a> We often refer to Rebecca and how the question was put to her, "Wilt thou go with this man?<a name=12:5></a>" <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24:58">Genesis  24:58</a>.<a name=12:6></a> The test with which Rebecca was faced was not whether she was going to be governed by what was worldly, but whether she was going to allow herself to be detained by what was legitimate in the natural sphere, her brother and her mother.<a name=12:7></a> That was the test with which she was faced, and when the question was raised with her, "Wilt thou go with this man?<a name=12:8></a>" ("this man" being a type of the Holy Spirit) she says, "I will go.<a name=12:9></a>" The result was, that she became a comfort to Isaac's heart and was loved by him, all suggesting the possibilities that are open to us to become a comfort to Christ if we will yield ourselves to what is spiritual.<a name=12:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The passage I read in 1st Corinthians emphasises this.<a name=12:11></a> It says, "The first man Adam became a living soul; the last Adam a quickening spirit.<a name=12:12></a>" You can see how what is spiritual comes in, how

		immensely greater Christ is than Adam.<a name=13:1></a> It is the last Adam we are to take account of.<a name=13:2></a> He is a life-giving spirit.<a name=13:3></a> I wonder whether we all recognise, that if we have received the Holy Spirit we partake by the Spirit in the life of the last Adam.<a name=13:4></a> That is a very elevating thought.<a name=13:5></a> In <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10">Luke  10</a>the Lord says, "rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven," but here we have not merely that our names are written in heaven, but we ourselves are heavenly and therefore fit for heaven.<a name=13:6></a> So it says here, "howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual," as though the Spirit of God through the apostle is urging upon us to take account of the fact that the change has now taken place; that there was that which was first, which was natural, but Christ having come in and the Spirit having come, what was ever in God's mind has come in; and He is urging us to take account of the glory of it, and to take account of the fact that we ourselves have been called to have part in these wonderful things.<a name=13:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle goes on to say, "the first man out of the earth, made of dust"; it is a question of what he was constitutionally.<a name=13:8></a> If Adam had never sinned he would still have been earthy, but the second Man, out of heaven!<a name=13:9></a> What an immensely superior order of manhood has come in in Christ, a divine Person, bringing supreme moral excellence into manhood.<a name=13:10></a> Think of the grace of God that has in mind that we should partake of it.<a name=13:11></a> This is not something mystical, but something which has actually come in by virtue of the fact, that we have received the Holy Spirit.<a name=13:12></a> We partake by the Spirit in the life of the heavenly One.<a name=13:13></a> "Such as he made of dust, such also those made of dust; and such as the heavenly one, such also the heavenly ones.<a name=13:14></a>" And, "as we have borne the image of the one made

		Well now, we can only enter upon what is spiritual, we can only take on the features of the One who is heavenly, in the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=14:2></a> God has given us the Holy Spirit in order that we might be able to take on what is spiritual, that we might find our life in what is spiritual and take on heavenly features.<a name=14:3></a> We were referring to the third chapter of John's gospel where we have the truth of new birth; that is, if there is to be anything for God, He must begin entirely anew.<a name=14:4></a> There must be a new moral being as a result of God's work, and the character of the new moral being is that it is spirit.<a name=14:5></a> "That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit," showing that the two are in absolute contrast.<a name=14:6></a> I think the Lord puts it that way so that we may understand, that God is working now on the lines of what is spiritual.<a name=14:7></a>

		I would turn to Exodus now in order to show that God would use the exercises of the wilderness that we may realise the need for the Spirit; and to give us, if we may so say, a taste for the Spirit, that we may really lay ourselves out for that which is spiritual.<a name=14:8></a> I can assure the younger brethren that they will never regret it if they do so.<a name=14:9></a> In the living water, a type of the Spirit, there is that which satisfies for ever.<a name=14:10></a> If I may go back for a moment in the history of God's people as brought out of Egypt, you will remember that at the end of <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15">Exodus  15</a>they went three days in the wilderness and found no water.<a name=14:11></a> Then when they did find it, it was bitter, so the waters were called Marah; and the question was, What were they to do?<a name=14:12></a> Now it is an early experience in our spiritual life to find that the circumstances which God orders for us are not at all according to our natural taste.<a name=14:13></a> There is nothing in the wilderness; that is, in the ordinary circumstances of responsible

		It is of great help, support and encouragement when we first begin to take account of the fact that the Lord Jesus in wonderful grace has entered into the circumstances of human life and has been through them as governed in every way by the principles proper to a man in relation to God.<a name=15:9></a> That is to say, as having His part in Deity it did not belong to Him to obey, for, you cannot attach the thought of obedience to God as such, but when the Lord Jesus entered into the human position, He entered into conditions to which obedience attached, and He filled them out in human life in perfect accord with the position which He had taken up.<a name=15:10></a> The carpenter's shop at Nazareth was not what men might regard as the most desirable of circumstances, but these circumstances were the will of God for Him, and He accepted them and filled them out in a glorious way on the principle of obedience.<a name=15:11></a> Everything the Father ordered for Him was pleasing to Him.<a name=15:12></a> His Father had been pleased to hide things from the wise and prudent and reveal them unto babes, and He said, "Even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight," <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10:21">Luke  10:21</a>.<a name=15:13></a> It alters the whole aspect of things in regard of that which may be contrary to our natural tastes if we begin to see that in the

		Following on that, we find in chapter 16 that the manna is given.<a name=16:12></a> God has introduced in the Person of Jesus the principle of obedience to His will, and now He says as it were, I will give you food and I will give it to you daily on that principle.<a name=16:13></a> The Lord Jesus moved in the circumstances of human life on the principle of one day at a time.<a name=16:14></a> He had His ear opened morning by morning.<a name=16:15></a> It was morning by morning that the manna was given.<a name=16:16></a> Moses said to the people, "In the evening, then shall ye know that Jehovah has brought you out from the land of Egypt; and in the morning, then shall ye see the glory of Jehovah.<a name=16:17></a>" They had desired flesh, and in the evening God brought up quails, not then in judgment as on a later occasion, but just to show them that, if necessary, He could do anything; He can work a miracle.<a name=16:18></a> He could order our circumstances, if He chose, so that they should all be congenial, but that would not result in any spiritual

		Then they came to a seventh day, a sabbath, and that is what results as we appropriate the manna, we come to rest in our souls.<a name=17:13></a> It produces sabbath conditions.<a name=17:14></a> "Come to me, all ye who labour and are burdened, and I will give you rest," <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11:28">Matthew  11:28</a>.<a name=17:15></a> And then the Lord shows us the way in which we get it; He says, "take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest to your souls.<a name=17:16></a>" He says, as it were, 'You must come the right way; take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me.<a name=17:17></a>' It was after feeding upon the manna for six days that they arrived at a seventh day, a sabbath of rest.<a name=17:18></a> I have said all that in order to show what Christ can be to us in the wilderness; but when we come to <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#17">Exodus  17</a>, it is not a question there of Christ so much, but of

		Now in the seventeenth chapter of Exodus we have the question of thirst again.<a name=18:6></a> There was no water and the people murmured.<a name=18:7></a> Water evidently alludes to the idea of refreshment and satisfaction, and we might as well face it, that God does not intend that we should find satisfaction save in the Holy Spirit.<a name=18:8></a> If we ignore this, we shall only be heaping up to our souls years of sorrow.<a name=18:9></a> We read that "the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.<a name=18:10></a>" There is no limit to His activities and what He can do for us, and God intends that we should, early understand that all the refreshment and satisfaction we need are to be found in the Spirit.<a name=18:11></a> So Moses cried to the Lord, and the Lord told him to go on before the people and take with him the elders of Israel and his rod, and He says, "I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink.<a name=18:12></a>" Think of that, the rock being smitten!<a name=18:13></a> Typically, it is Jehovah Himself being smitten in the Person of Jesus.<a name=18:14></a> It is as though God would say, so urgent is it that these people should receive the Spirit, that they should have all the joy

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, the next thing we find is that the position is challenged.<a name=19:7></a> Amalek comes up against them and Moses at once calls upon Joshua.<a name=19:8></a> Joshua was only a young man.<a name=19:9></a> I do hope that the younger brothers and sisters will not think that these things are relegated to the older ones.<a name=19:10></a> I read this passage because Joshua particularly represents one who is in the gain of the Spirit.<a name=19:11></a> In certain positions he is typical of Christ Himself, but in the main he is rather representative of one who is in the gain of the Holy Spirit.<a name=19:12></a> Here, he is intended to be representative of us all.<a name=19:13></a> Now Amalek represents the power of Satan working through the flesh, and I am sure you will have noticed that Amalek is most inveterate.<a name=19:14></a> His hand is on the throne of Jah.<a name=19:15></a> He is deliberately opposed to the rights of God, and God will have war with him from generation to generation.<a name=19:16></a> The flesh is incurable.<a name=19:17></a> It says that they who are in the flesh cannot please God, and that the mind of the flesh is enmity against God.<a name=19:18></a> We are to understand what flesh is, the awfulness of it, and that there is no escape from it save as we walk in the Spirit.<a name=19:19></a> The point is, On whose side are we going to be?<a name=19:20></a> Are we going to be like Joshua, who chose men and fought

	<div class="paragraph">
		against Amalek?<a name=20:1></a> We read that "Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.<a name=20:2></a> And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed; and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.<a name=20:3></a>" You may say, Is there any weakness with the Lord?<a name=20:4></a> For Moses with the rod in his hand on the top of the hill is a type of Christ.<a name=20:5></a> What does it mean?<a name=20:6></a> There is certainly no weakness with the Lord, but I believe that Moses with his rod represents the authority of the Lord over our souls, which sometimes becomes weakened.<a name=20:7></a> Satan is aiming at that, to weaken the Lord's authority over us.<a name=20:8></a> Now when Moses' hands were heavy, Aaron and Hur supported them.<a name=20:9></a> Aaron represents the sympathetic support of Christ.<a name=20:10></a> The Lord understands all about our exercises and is prepared to support us in them.<a name=20:11></a> If our exercises are in singleness of heart, which Hur perhaps represents, his name meaning <i>purity</i>, and we are set to go in for the best, although we have to feel what flesh is, how opposed it is to the things of God, yet if we will allow the Lord's authority over us, we shall be given the victory.<a name=20:12></a> Aaron and Hur stayed up Moses' hands, "the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.<a name=20:13></a>" And the next verse says that "Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.<a name=20:14></a>" Joshua in that way started on this journey of becoming spiritual, and he started by accepting the conflict that flesh will always bring in; but he proved the support of the Lord.<a name=20:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is very important, beloved brethren, though elementary.<a name=20:16></a> "Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua.<a name=20:17></a>" How the Lord had His eye on Joshua, and He has His eye on everyone here, because of what we are destined for, such great things.<a name=20:18></a> He would have these things rehearsed in the ears of everyone, "I will utterly

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In closing, I would refer briefly to <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#27">Numbers  27</a>, where we read that God had told Moses that he was not to go into the land.<a name=21:10></a> He had failed in the test, failed to sanctify God.<a name=21:11></a> It says in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#106">Psalm  106</a>that the people provoked Moses in his spirit "so that he spoke unadvisedly with his lips.<a name=21:12></a>" They provoked his spirit.<a name=21:13></a> God is concerned with our spirits, rather than with our bodies.<a name=21:14></a> He gives us our bodies as vessels in which to serve Him, and to some He may preserve health and strength for a little while; with others He may allow poor health and suffering, but the great thing is our spirits.<a name=21:15></a> Hebrews calls Him "the Father of spirits.<a name=21:16></a>" This scripture calls Him "the God of the spirits of all flesh.<a name=21:17></a>" Proverbs tells us that one who rules his spirit is better than

	<div class="paragraph">
		Moses leaves it to the Lord to name the leader, and Jehovah immediately says, "Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit.<a name=22:22></a>" Joshua was now considerably older than he was in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#17">Exodus  17</a>.<a name=22:23></a> This is the kind of person we need to lead us into heavenly things.<a name=22:24></a> Joshua was pre-eminently the leader for the land, while Moses was the great leader for the wilderness, because he was faithful in all God's house.<a name=22:25></a> But a leader for the land must be one who is characterised by affording liberty to the Spirit

		I have the desire, dear brethren, to speak of Christ as available to us as food, first as the passover, secondly as the manna, then as the living bread come down from heaven, and finally as the old corn of the land.<a name=24:1></a> There are other aspects in which Christ is presented to be fed upon, but these four are of great importance and follow in consecutive order; and it will help I believe, if we can gain some impression of Christ on these distinctive lines.<a name=24:2></a> I need not say that it is important that we should cultivate the habit of appropriating spiritual food.<a name=24:3></a> No one of us who was in anything but the poorest of health would contemplate for a moment going on for long without food, and yet there may be a danger with some of us of neglecting spiritual food; whereas the habit of feeding is just as essential to spiritual life as it is to natural life.<a name=24:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Food is presented in the spiritual sphere attractively in that Christ in different aspects is the food of His people.<a name=24:5></a> There may be certain aspects also in which the saints themselves may be food, for David when fleeing from Saul fed on the shewbread taken from before the Lord; the shew-bread I think referring to the saints as they appear before God in their unity and order.<a name=24:6></a> David fed upon it.<a name=24:7></a> You can understand how at a time when some of God's people were acting in a way that was unworthy of them as His people in persecuting God's anointed, it was important that David should be sustained in his spirit by feeding upon God's thoughts regarding His people, and not allowing himself to be occupied with their waywardness.<a name=24:8></a> But in a general sense it is Christ who is presented as the food of the saints.<a name=24:9></a>

		When one speaks of feeding upon Christ or upon spiritual food whatever it is, the idea is that we allow our minds to dwell upon it, and our minds become the inlet to the affections, for the spiritual affections are fed with that with which the mind engages itself.<a name=25:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, the first thing that comes before us in the scriptures we have read is the passover, and I would say at the outset that the passover is an idea which goes right through.<a name=25:2></a> It is not exactly an elementary idea; it is rather a fundamental one.<a name=25:3></a> That is, the passover was celebrated in Egypt, it was celebrated in the wilderness, it was celebrated in the land, but manna was only partaken of in the wilderness; at least, it was wilderness food.<a name=25:4></a> The passover is something that applies to us in whatever position we are found.<a name=25:5></a> It was that which became strength to God's people to move out of Egypt.<a name=25:6></a> It was that which they had to celebrate in the wilderness, and it was that which they had to celebrate constantly in the land.<a name=25:7></a> Hence you will see that it is a basic idea that applies to us in whatever position we are regarded.<a name=25:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think it is important, beloved brethren, to lay hold of that, for the passover represents I need not say, Christ as the One who endured in an unmitigated way the judgment of God against sin.<a name=25:9></a> As feeding upon it, it becomes the lever in our affections by which we ourselves are maintained in the same judgment of sin as God has expressed in the death of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=25:10></a> When once that is seen, you will understand how basic it is, because in whatever position we are looked at it is essential as God's people that we should be maintained in the judgment of sin.<a name=25:11></a> Any amount of privilege will not avail us if we go on in the allowance of that which God has judged in the cross of Christ.<a name=25:12></a> The fact that we are sons, the fact that we are blessed with all spiritual

		All the scriptures read refer to eating.<a name=26:3></a> I did not read the scripture that refers to the putting of the blood on the lintel, because that act did not need to be repeated.<a name=26:4></a> Indeed, the passover strictly speaking did not need to be repeated, but the moral import of the passover needs to be renewed and maintained, and that is seen in the feast of unleavened bread.<a name=26:5></a> Paul, in writing to the Corinthians in regard to the state of things that existed there, says, "Christ our passover has been sacrificed," <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5:7">1 Corinthians  5:7</a>.<a name=26:6></a> The words "for us" are not there really.<a name=26:7></a> The point is not exactly what has been done for us, but that Christ our passover has been sacrificed.<a name=26:8></a> That has been done and therefore the only thing remaining to be done is for the feast of unleavened bread to be celebrated.<a name=26:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the feast of unleavened bread is the moral answer in us to the passover as setting out the way that Christ has borne the judgment of God against sin.<a name=26:10></a> So when the passover was instituted they were told to "Eat none of it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roast with fire"; that was the important thing; "roast with fire.<a name=26:11></a>" The fire speaks of the direct action of judgment in an unmitigated way, and that is seen when we contemplate the cross, for there the Lord felt the terrible character of divine judgment against sin, expressing His feelings in those words, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?<a name=26:12></a>" In expressing His feelings thus, He did not ask for any mitigation of the judgment but rather He testified to the rightness of it for He says, "And thou art holy, thou that dwellest amidst the

		Well, it says they were to eat it with bitter herbs, "its head with its legs, and with its inwards.<a name=27:3></a>" It is to make it more appealing to our hearts, for the head would refer to the personal dignity of the One concerned.<a name=27:4></a> The legs would refer to the immaculate purity and beauty of His walk, and the inwards would speak of those inward perfections which were so delightful to God when laid bare.<a name=27:5></a> Yet everything came under the action of the fire, and we are to have that in our minds in order that we may obtain a right impression of what lawlessness and self-will are in the sight of God.<a name=27:6></a> I fear we tend to have a very weak sense sometimes of what sin is.<a name=27:7></a> We judge the more flagrant things but we often have a very light apprehension of what pleasing ourselves is in the sight of God.<a name=27:8></a> It is really the working of the will of the creature in opposition to the will of the Creator, and that is why it is to be dealt with so unsparingly.<a name=27:9></a> The great thought is, that we, as God's redeemed people, might be delivered from every kind of lawlessness.<a name=27:10></a> This is presented to us as the food that lies at the basis of our spiritual prosperity; the passover was to be eaten thus, with bitter herbs.<a name=27:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I would pass on now to the thought of the manna.<a name=28:8></a> It has an important place as food for God's people.<a name=28:9></a> In contrast to the passover which applies to us in every position in which we may be viewed, the manna is distinctly food for the wilderness only; that is to say, it is food especially provided to help the people of God in their responsible pathway here.<a name=28:10></a> How gracious of God to provide us with food to support us in every position we may be in, according to His will!<a name=28:11></a> We need manna if we are to fill out the responsible pathway.<a name=28:12></a> Many of us have to go to business, and sisters have their household duties to perform, and the Christian children have to go to school.<a name=28:13></a> All these are different positions in which according to God's will we are set here in responsibility; and what we find, as desiring to fill these positions to His pleasure, is that there is nothing

		So the manna was provided as food for the wilderness and there was no other food provided.<a name=29:3></a> At the outset, for one day, God gave them quails; and then at a later period He gave them quails because they lusted after flesh.<a name=29:4></a> "Not one day shall ye eat, nor two days, .<a name=29:5></a>.<a name=29:6></a>.<a name=29:7></a> but for a whole month, until it comes out at your nostrils, and it become loathsome unto you; because that ye have despised Jehovah," <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#11:19">Numbers  11:19</a>, 20.<a name=29:8></a> They lusted after flesh and they got it.<a name=29:9></a> "For he that sows to his own flesh, shall reap corruption from the flesh, but he that sows to the Spirit, from the Spirit shall reap eternal life," <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#6:8">Galatians  6:8</a>.<a name=29:10></a> In grace God gave them quails for one day.<a name=29:11></a> It was never intended that they should live on quails, but just that they should see that God could do anything.<a name=29:12></a> Just by a word He brought up quails to feed the host of Israel.<a name=29:13></a> There is no limit to God's resources and power, and if it were His will to make everything easy for us in this life.<a name=29:14></a> He could quite easily do so, but that is not His way.<a name=29:15></a> He has in mind to humble us in order, as it says in Deuteronomy, "to do thee good at thy latter end.<a name=29:16></a>"

		God intends that every one of us should be marked by the great moral features of dependence upon Him, which is after all, man's greatest and truest glory.<a name=29:17></a> Men think it is great to be independent, but He who is God over all, as having become Man says, "I was cast upon thee from the womb," <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22:10">Psalm  22:10</a>.<a name=29:18></a> That was how the Lord viewed the matter.<a name=29:19></a> It was His glory, as having become Man, to be dependent on God, and it is man's true glory to be maintained in the position of dependence that is rightly his as God's creature; and along with that is the great

		principle of obedience.<a name=30:1></a> Dependence is something that flesh regards as irksome, and obedience is something that flesh greatly dislikes; but dependence and obedience have been rendered morally glorious by our Lord Jesus Christ who, though God over all, blessed for ever, as having become Man did not desire a reputation but "taking a bondman's form .<a name=30:2></a>.<a name=30:3></a>.<a name=30:4></a> and having been found in figure as a man, humbled himself, becoming obedient even unto death, and that the death of the cross"; <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:7">Philippians  2:7</a>.<a name=30:5></a> The manner of His death was one in which obedience was tested to the full, and it says, "Wherefore," that is, because of the moral excellency of it; "Wherefore also God highly exalted him, and granted him a name, that which is above every name.<a name=30:6></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are intended not simply to accept these things as statements of fact, but to contemplate them, that the One marked pre-eminently and perfectly by obedience has been given a Name above every name.<a name=30:7></a> We are to be impressed with the fact that God regards obedience with the greatest pleasure.<a name=30:8></a> It is in His sight of great moral worth.<a name=30:9></a> These two features of dependence and obedience in manhood are two great things which God would develop in us by means of feeding upon the manna, and He orders the circumstances of our wilderness path with a view to furthering this great end.<a name=30:10></a> He fed the people with manna and humbled them that He "might do them good at their latter end.<a name=30:11></a>" If God brings upon us any circumstances which we find to be humbling, it is all with a view to doing us good at our latter end.<a name=30:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		One great feature of the manna was that it was to be gathered daily.<a name=30:13></a> There was never enough for more than one day except on the sixth day of the week when God gave them enough to carry them over the sabbath, in order that they might know what rest was, but the principle was that there was

		just enough for one day, no more.<a name=31:1></a> That is a thing that God would have us learn in our responsible path, that a great feature of a Christian's life is to be here governed by the will of God and renewed in it day by day.<a name=31:2></a> It makes life so simple if we take things up on that principle.<a name=31:3></a> It means, that we are not looking a long way ahead and wondering how we are going to get on.<a name=31:4></a> We only have to look after today.<a name=31:5></a> I commend that to you.<a name=31:6></a> It is a simple thing to say, but I think a helpful thing to bear in mind, that all we have to be concerned about is today, and therefore let us watch what we have to do today.<a name=31:7></a> When saints get turned aside it has not all happened in a moment.<a name=31:8></a> It is always the result of departure from the Lord; of allowing something to come in that brings in distance; and there was a moment when it began, and if there has been watchfulness on that day, the day it began, it never would have begun.<a name=31:9></a> If we are watchful today, all will be well.<a name=31:10></a> When tomorrow comes then it is today, but all we need is to go on one day at a time; and that is the principle in the manna.<a name=31:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The manna was given fresh from heaven every day.<a name=31:12></a> When the dew was gone there lay on the face of the wilderness a small round thing.<a name=31:13></a> How touching!<a name=31:14></a> In how small a way God came in in the Person of Jesus.<a name=31:15></a> He who created all things by His word, and upholds them by the word of His power, came into human circumstances as a Babe; into such humble circumstances as being in a place like Nazareth, and then in a carpenter's shop.<a name=31:16></a> Think of the grace of this, that He should thus come in order that He might become to millions of His saints, who would afterwards tread the wilderness path, food to sustain them there.<a name=31:17></a> When the writer of the Hebrews speaks about what was to be seen in the holy of holies he says, "and the ark of the covenant, covered round in every part with gold, in

		which were the golden pot that had the manna.<a name=32:1></a>" There is no mention of a golden pot in Exodus.<a name=32:2></a> We would never have known it was a golden pot if it had not been for the writer of the Hebrews.<a name=32:3></a> He had been into the holy of holies to contemplate it and he says, "the <i>golden</i> pot that had the manna," as if he was impressed with the glory of it, that the Creator of the earth should come down and fill out each day the conditions of human life, in order that in so doing He might become the food of His saints right through the wilderness path.<a name=32:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So that, dear brethren, is the importance of our learning to appropriate the manna.<a name=32:5></a> It was a small round thing, and therefore it fits into any circumstances.<a name=32:6></a> Whatever circumstances God orders for us can all be accepted from His hand on the principle of obedience.<a name=32:7></a> It makes everything so simple.<a name=32:8></a> Six days of feeding on manna brings us to a seventh day of rest, because the more the principle of manna is accepted, the more we find rest to our souls.<a name=32:9></a> However testing conditions may be, you are in the will of God and will have His support.<a name=32:10></a> I need not enlarge on that, save that I believe to feed on the manna morally develops what we speak of as shittim wood, an order of man that can stand up in the wilderness in the testimony of God.<a name=32:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we come to a further food which is not referred to in the passages we read in Joshua; the reason being that in the type the people of God were either in the wilderness on the one hand, or in the land on the other.<a name=32:12></a> When they left the wilderness they were in the land, but in the actual experience of God's people things are not quite so definite as that.<a name=32:13></a> We have to be in the wilderness in certain circumstances, and then in others we may pass over to that which answers to the land.<a name=32:14></a> Now there is a food which will enable us to pass over and we get it brought forward in the sixth of John's gospel, for

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the living bread come down from heaven is not manna.<a name=33:1></a> The food in the sixth of John is not food for the wilderness.<a name=33:2></a> That is quite clear, for the Lord says "Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness and died.<a name=33:3></a> This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, that one may eat of it and not die.<a name=33:4></a>" So that however valuable in its place, as relating to wilderness exercises, the manna is, it is not that which is spoken of in the sixth of John.<a name=33:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe the food in the sixth of John is that by means of which we accustom ourselves to find our life in spiritual things; that is, it has in view that we should enjoy eternal life.<a name=33:6></a> We are to find our life in that which death cannot touch.<a name=33:7></a> It is important to note, beloved brethren, that even the best of natural relationships held under the hand of God in thankfulness and purity -- not spoiled as they are in the world -- even these are subject to death.<a name=33:8></a> The happier we are in natural affections, the more keenly death is felt when it invades them.<a name=33:9></a> But there is an order of life and interest which may be known while we are still in this world which death cannot touch; and it is the enjoyment of these things that Scripture speaks of as eternal life in John's writings.<a name=33:10></a> Paul presents eternal life from the future aspect, whereas John presents it as something to be enjoyed at the present time, and this is what is typically spoken of as <i>the land</i>.<a name=33:11></a> It is the thoughts of God which His love has purposed for those whom He has taken up, standing in relation to Christ where He is, but enjoyed now in the power of the Holy Spirit; so that we pass over in our affections from the natural order of things to the spiritual order of things.<a name=33:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first scripture we read from John, the Lord says, "I am the living bread which has come down out of heaven: if any one shall have eaten of this bread he shall live for ever.<a name=33:13></a>" He first of all presents the idea of bread as food which will be sustaining

	<div class="paragraph">
		in its effect, and He Himself is the food.<a name=34:1></a> We are to get that clearly before us.<a name=34:2></a> He came down from heaven as the manna, but now He is presenting Himself as another kind of food also to be appropriated.<a name=34:3></a> When He comes to the thought of our appropriating Him as the living bread, He changes the figure and refers to His flesh as meat and His blood as drink.<a name=34:4></a> In most scriptures where the Lord's flesh is referred to, it has in view His having deliberately come into flesh and blood condition in order by death to terminate that condition and open up for us a new order of life beyond death.<a name=34:5></a> I think it nearly always has that in mind.<a name=34:6></a> I will not say invariably, for the fifth of Hebrews speaks of "the days of his flesh," but mostly where His flesh or His having come in flesh, is referred to, it has in view that He deliberately took up flesh and blood condition in order to terminate it in His death.<a name=34:7></a> That being so, are we going to continue to try and find our satisfaction in an order of life which He has terminated?<a name=34:8></a> At the end of the chapter the Lord speaks of the Spirit's power to quicken.<a name=34:9></a> We cannot understand these things nor get the gain of them save by the Spirit.<a name=34:10></a> The Lord is presenting His flesh and His blood as something to be fed upon by us; that is, we are to feed our minds and affections on the fact that He has died.<a name=34:11></a> Not now that we might be justified and forgiven, but in order that He might have the right to introduce us by the Spirit into a new order of life set out in Himself risen from among the dead.<a name=34:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So He says, "He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood has life eternal, and I will raise him up at the last day: for my flesh is truly food and my blood is truly drink.<a name=34:13></a>" There may be an allusion in that both to the love of Christ as having come in flesh and to the love of God; for the blood often speaks of the love of God.<a name=34:14></a> The blood refers to the pleasure that God had in the life of Jesus here, so we read of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the precious blood of Christ.<a name=35:1></a> And the blood was poured out in order that we might be brought into a new order of life in Christ beyond death.<a name=35:2></a> Thus we can understand that when the Lord says, "For <i>my</i> flesh is meat indeed and <i>my</i> blood is drink indeed," He is reminding us of His own personal love, and indeed of Himself, and also of the love of God which entered into the matter.<a name=35:3></a> The circle of the saints where the Spirit of God is, is the sphere of eternal life, but eternal life in itself is in God's Son.<a name=35:4></a> Then the Lord says, "and I will raise him up at the last day.<a name=35:5></a>" That is to say, it is on this principle that we go right through, not like those whose carcases fell in the wilderness, but as those who went through like Caleb.<a name=35:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In closing, I would refer briefly to the old corn of the land, for that was food which they fed upon as having come into the land, and it was intended to support them in that position.<a name=35:7></a> I read those two verses in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>because I think they convey somewhat of the idea.<a name=35:8></a> The old corn of the land refers, as may be seen from the fifth chapter of Joshua, to the previous harvest (see Mr.<a name=35:9></a> Darby's note); that is, it was there before they arrived at the land.<a name=35:10></a> They found it there when they got there; it belonged to the land.<a name=35:11></a> And that is exactly what the Lord presents to us in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>.<a name=35:12></a> He is alluding to the fact that He is going on before.<a name=35:13></a> At the beginning of the same chapter he says, "Ye believe on God, believe also on me.<a name=35:14></a>" He is really speaking anticipatively, speaking in view of His taking His place in the presence of the Father.<a name=35:15></a> It is there that He wants us to believe on Him.<a name=35:16></a> He would have our affections engaged with Himself in the new position which He has opened up by entering there for us.<a name=35:17></a> And in order to make things real He tells them He will send the Holy Spirit.<a name=35:18></a> He is speaking of course to all the saints, and He speaks of the gain that the

		presence of the Comforter would be to them.<a name=36:1></a> And He says further, "I am coming to you.<a name=36:2></a>" Not only would the Comforter be with them, but in addition the Lord says He would come and personally visit them, referring to visitations from time to time.<a name=36:3></a> And then He adds, "Yet a little and the world sees me no longer; but ye see me; because I live, ye also shall live.<a name=36:4></a>" While the world sees Him no more, we <i>do</i> see Him, for the Spirit engages our hearts with Christ where He is.<a name=36:5></a> The Spirit becomes the power to believe on Him where He is and as He is.<a name=36:6></a> Because He lives, we live also, for our life is in relation to another scene.<a name=36:7></a> We realise that our portion is bound up with Himself.<a name=36:8></a> "Because I live ye also shall live.<a name=36:9></a>" He has gone on before, but this verse presents Him to us as the old corn of the land, the One who is already there and belongs there, and we as feeding on Him are sustained in relation to our heavenly portion.<a name=36:10></a> "In that day ye shall know that I am in my Father.<a name=36:11></a>" It refers to the day of the Spirit.<a name=36:12></a> Then He says, "ye in me.<a name=36:13></a>" That is our position.<a name=36:14></a> And finally, "I in you.<a name=36:15></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I trust I have said enough, dear brethren, to suggest the wealth that there is for us in appropriating Christ as food.<a name=36:16></a> How wonderfully adaptable He is, if I may reverently say so!<a name=36:17></a> The feast of unleavened bread is important and basic.<a name=36:18></a> Then there is the manna for the wilderness, and wonderful gain there is in it for us.<a name=36:19></a> Thirdly, there is the living bread come down from heaven to enable us to pass over in our minds and affections; and lastly, there is the old corn of the land; "because I live ye also shall live.<a name=36:20></a>"

		These scriptures, dear brethren, all refer to the disciple and his teacher, or the bondman and his lord; the passage in Luke referring to the disciple and his teacher; the passage in Matthew bringing in both the disciple and his teacher, and the bondman and his lord; and the passage in John referring to the bondman and his lord only.<a name=37:1></a> The intention in each is the same, that whether we regard ourselves as disciples of Christ; that is, as those who are learning, for that is the idea of a disciple, or whether we regard ourselves as bondmen, which is surely the attitude of mind that each of us should take up, we are to keep in mind that the standard of what God is pleased with, and is working to in each one of us, is what is set out in our Teacher and our Lord.<a name=37:2></a> We are to remember that the disciple is not above his teacher, and the bondman is not above his lord.<a name=37:3></a> And indeed when we come to the passage in Luke it says that "every one that is perfect (or as it should read perfected) shall be as his teacher," which is a remarkable statement, showing that there is a process going on with every one of us.<a name=37:4></a> Discipline will come in in connection with it as may be necessary, for it is a question of disciples, but "every one that is perfected," it says, "shall be as his teacher.<a name=37:5></a>"

		It is a great thing to keep in mind, dear brethren, the setting of the passage in Luke, although there is a certain similarity between these three passages.<a name=37:6></a> The setting of the passage in Luke seems to be on the line of what is moral; that is, we are viewed as in an evil world where men are unthankful and unholy, and may even be our enemies, but in that setting of what is moral the saints are to be disciplined, and to come out like God.<a name=37:7></a> Indeed it says, "ye shall

		In the first chapter of this gospel the word which the angel said to Mary, speaking of the incoming of Jesus, was that He should be called "the Son of the Highest.<a name=38:5></a>" In verse 32 of chapter 1 it says "He shall be great, and shall be called Son of the Highest; and the Lord God shall give him the throne of David his father.<a name=38:6></a>" <i>The Highest</i> is a remarkable expression, and refers, I believe, to the supreme moral excellence that is seen in God.<a name=38:7></a> He says in the prophet Isaiah, "as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts," <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#55:9">Isaiah  55:9</a>.<a name=38:8></a> God has been pleased to bring in the heavens in relation to the earth, to provide us, so to speak, with a means of measurement, a means by which we may come to an estimation of moral values; and if we can measure how much higher the heavens are than the earth, then we shall get some impression of how much higher God's ways are than our ways, and God's thoughts than our thoughts.<a name=38:9></a> Hence the expression <i>The Highest</i>, as applied to God in Luke's gospel, is

		I want to speak, dear brethren, of the wisdom of God, and to show how it is to come into expression in the assembly.<a name=51:1></a> What one has in mind in referring to it is that we might all gain some impression of the greatness of what God has called us to, for if we have been laid hold of by the gospel which has reached us in this day of the Spirit, we have been laid hold of to form part of the assembly, which is the greatest conception that divine love and wisdom could possibly bring into being.<a name=51:2></a> I hope I may be able to convey some little impression of that, how it is intended, that in it God's wisdom should be seen.<a name=51:3></a> At the end of the epistle to the Romans, it says, "To God only wise," the force of the expression being really, 'To God who alone is wise,' conveying that wisdom is only with God, not, of course, that He cannot impart it to men, for He can, as it says, "If any one of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all freely and reproaches not, and it shall be given to him," <a href="../bible/James.htm#1:5">James  1:5</a>.<a name=51:4></a> It is a great thing to get the sense that God only is wise.<a name=51:5></a> Solomon says in <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#21">Proverbs  21</a>, "There is no wisdom, nor understanding, nor counsel against Jehovah.<a name=51:6></a>" That is a very great comfort, that whatever man and Satan may do against God, and against His people, there is no wisdom in it finally.<a name=51:7></a> It may appear to have wisdom, and to a certain extent according to man's reckoning, it <i>may</i> have wisdom, but in the long run it will be all exposed as utter folly.<a name=51:8></a> God will expose it.<a name=51:9></a> And so in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#12">Revelation  12</a>, the dragon appears with seven heads.<a name=51:10></a> That has a suggestion of completeness of wisdom, apparently, for the head is the seat of wisdom; and in chapter 13 the first beast

		appears, and he has seven heads.<a name=52:1></a> He is one of Satan's agents that will shortly appear when the assembly is gone.<a name=52:2></a> Satan and the beast both appear to have remarkable wisdom, but where does it end?<a name=52:3></a> It ends in the lake of fire.<a name=52:4></a> The beast will be taken and cast alive into the lake of fire, and Satan will eventually be cast into the lake of fire, too, and that is the end, you see, of all wisdom against God; that is where it ends, and where its utter folly will be demonstrated.<a name=52:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we have in <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#8">Proverbs  8</a>the thought of wisdom, which is personified there.<a name=52:6></a> It does not literally refer to Christ, because you will notice that all through the chapter it speaks of wisdom in the feminine.<a name=52:7></a> It says in chapter 9: "Wisdom hath built her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars," and so on; so that wisdom is presented, not exactly as a figure of Christ, although there is no doubt whatever that when Christ appeared, the wisdom of God came into expression in Him, as we shall see in a moment; but the idea in <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#8">Proverbs  8</a>is of wisdom regarded as a quality, and what God says about it.<a name=52:8></a> Wisdom, which is personified in the chapter says, "Jehovah possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.<a name=52:9></a> I" (that is wisdom) "was set up from eternity, from the beginning, before the earth was.<a name=52:10></a>" Now I understand that to mean, that before God began to work out His thoughts, He committed Himself to wisdom.<a name=52:11></a> His way as I understand it, is the means He takes to effectuate the thoughts that His heart has formed.<a name=52:12></a> God begins by forming certain thoughts, certain purposes, then the question is, how He is going to work them out; and with a view to working out what thoughts He had formed, He commits Himself to wisdom.<a name=52:13></a> It says, "Jehovah possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.<a name=52:14></a> I was set up from eternity.<a name=52:15></a>" That is to say, God does not do what men do.<a name=52:16></a> They get an idea and they begin to work it out, and they find, perhaps, that they have

	<div class="paragraph">
		to scrap what they have done and begin again; or they achieve a certain measure of success, but they have to amend their original plan, and someone else comes along with something better; and so there is a continual displacement and supersession of what had gone before, but not so with God.<a name=53:1></a> If God forms a purpose, He carefully thinks out, according to wisdom, how He is going to work it out.<a name=53:2></a> He commits Himself to wisdom before He begins His operations, and then when He begins His operations.<a name=53:3></a> He carries them through in wisdom in relation to the thoughts He has already formed; so that first of all, we get, "Jehovah possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.<a name=53:4></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then from verse 27 onwards, we read, "When he prepared the heavens, I was there; when he ordained the circle upon the face of the deep; .<a name=53:5></a>.<a name=53:6></a>.<a name=53:7></a> when he imposed on the sea his decree that the waters should not pass his commandment, when he appointed the foundations of the earth: then I was by him.<a name=53:8></a>" That is, when God began His operations in creation, wisdom was by Him.<a name=53:9></a> "By him" it says; using figurative language, "his nursling: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him; rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth, and my delights were with the sons of men.<a name=53:10></a>" It is figurative language, suggestive, I believe, of the pleasure that God had in taking account of the thoughts He had formed in relation to the sons of men, and in the way in which He was going step by step, to bring these thoughts into expression and full completion.<a name=53:11></a> One cannot go into all the details.<a name=53:12></a> I have no doubt there was a reason in everything.<a name=53:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What God had in mind in relation to the sons of men was to form in that order of creation, <i>men</i>, not angels, but men, those who should be competent to respond to Him perfectly, to be brought into a place of greatest nearness and most holy intimacy, to be

		able to appreciate His glory and respond to it intelligently.<a name=54:1></a> Wonderful things God had in mind, showing unselfish He is; that He, being what He is, desired to have creatures before Him of such a character that they should be able to appreciate what He is with wonderful intelligence, and to respond to Him in wonderful affection.<a name=54:2></a> With nothing less than that would God be satisfied, and so I have no doubt that all these things had a meaning.<a name=54:3></a> "When he imposed on the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment.<a name=54:4></a>" What a comfort that is!<a name=54:5></a> The sea usually represents the workings of lawless men acted upon by Satan, but they are under control.<a name=54:6></a> It was in divine wisdom, dear brethren, that we should be here in a world of evil, for it is in having to be here and having to learn how to choose the good and refuse the evil, and having to learn to trust in God in the presence of evil; it is in all these things that we develop morally and spiritually, so that we may fit the position that God has in mind for us.<a name=54:7></a> And so He was pleased to allow that evil should come in, and that those who were the subjects of His purpose should find themselves in a world of evil, but what was it for?<a name=54:8></a> For our formation and education in the knowledge of Himself.<a name=54:9></a> And so He "imposed on the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment.<a name=54:10></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What a comfort that is, when evil arises like a flood, as it does, sometimes, the saints fall back on that, that God has said to the sea, "Hitherto shalt thou come and no further, and here shall thy proud waves be stayed," <a href="../bible/Job.htm#38:11">Job  38:11</a>; and we trust in God that when the waves of lawlessness arise, that He will just say to them, "no further.<a name=54:11></a>" The whole matter is under His control.<a name=54:12></a> We are thankful for that.<a name=54:13></a> So the seed of Abraham is likened to the sand of the seashore.<a name=54:14></a> God made the sea and provided the sand on the seashore.<a name=54:15></a> You may say, how weak is

		the sand, just little grains; but as held together the sand provides a barrier that the waves of the sea cannot pass over.<a name=55:1></a> And that is just what the saints are; they stand as a great bulwark against the forces of evil, so that however much they arise, there is something here that cannot be overcome.<a name=55:2></a> It is the seed of Abraham, the true seed of faith, those who know God, and God has set them as the bound of the sea, that it cannot pass over; <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#5:22">Jeremiah  5:22</a>.<a name=55:3></a> All these details of creation, I have no doubt, were in divine wisdom because of what God was going to work out in relation to the sons of men.<a name=55:4></a> Wisdom's delights were with the sons of men.<a name=55:5></a> Wonderful thing to think of!<a name=55:6></a> Long before time, as we know it, was created, God had created angels; when He laid the foundations of the earth, "all the sons of God," it says, "shouted for joy," <a href="../bible/Job.htm#38:7">Job  38:7</a>.<a name=55:7></a> They were undoubtedly angels, and angels are creatures of much greater power than men, remarkable power, "angels, mighty in strength," David says in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#103:20">Psalm  103:20</a>.<a name=55:8></a> One angel was able, without any difficulty, to dispose of the army of Sennacherib, an army of one hundred and eighty-five thousand.<a name=55:9></a> Think of the power of one angel, and yet, when it was a question of the purpose of His love, God did not choose angels, but set His delight on the sons of men!<a name=55:10></a> It ought to affect us greatly, that God has passed by angels and taken up the sons of men.<a name=55:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, that being so, how is it to be worked out?<a name=55:12></a> How was God to secure an order of man that would be great enough morally to satisfy His heart and be able to respond to Him intelligently and appreciatively?<a name=55:13></a> Well, the next great step in divine wisdom is the incarnation.<a name=55:14></a> The great secret of divine wisdom is the wonderful fact that one of the Persons of the Godhead would become a Man, and so you get the Lord constantly speaking of Himself as the Son of man.<a name=55:15></a> Wisdom's delights were with the

	<div class="paragraph">
		sons of men, but now the Son of man comes in.<a name=56:1></a> That is a title that the Lord constantly took as referring to Himself as One who had come in to take up all that belonged to man.<a name=56:2></a> He had to take up, dear brethren, all that attached to man because of sin, and give His life a ransom for many, if God's thoughts for man were to be worked out.<a name=56:3></a> So we find Him saying, "The Son of man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many," <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#20:28">Matthew  20:28</a>.<a name=56:4></a> Oh, wonderful grace!<a name=56:5></a> And yet on the other hand, God had destined man for the highest place.<a name=56:6></a> It says in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>, "What is man that thou art mindful of him?<a name=56:7></a> and the son of man, that thou visitest him?<a name=56:8></a> Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and splendour.<a name=56:9></a> Thou hast made him to rule over the works of thy hands; thou hast put everything under his feet.<a name=56:10></a>" That is what God has destined for man, but it was all to be taken up by the Son of man.<a name=56:11></a> In the end of chapter 1 of John's gospel, Nathanael said to the Lord "<i>Thou</i> art the Son of God, <i>thou</i> art the king of Israel," and the Lord said, "Thou shalt see greater things than these.<a name=56:12></a> And he says to him, Verily, verily, I say to you, Henceforth ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man.<a name=56:13></a>" "The Son of God, the king of Israel," related to Israel, but the Lord said, "Thou shalt see greater things than these .<a name=56:14></a>.<a name=56:15></a>.<a name=56:16></a> .<a name=56:17></a> Ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man.<a name=56:18></a>" That is, the Son of man would be supreme, and the angels of God would ascend and descend upon Him; ascending, as it were, to receive His instructions, and descending to execute them, so great is the place of man in the Person of Christ.<a name=56:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in the verse I read in <a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>, the Lord says, "No one has gone up into heaven, save he who came

		<a name=57>[Page 57]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		down out of heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven.<a name=57:1></a>" The latter is a remarkable expression, involving His deity.<a name=57:2></a> Though here as a Man, walking here on this earth, and speaking to Nicodemus, He could yet speak of Himself as "the Son of man who is in heaven.<a name=57:3></a>" He does not say, 'Who was in heaven,' nor 'who is going to be in heaven'; but "the Son of man who is in heaven.<a name=57:4></a>" It is an expression which necessarily involves His deity, because when you come to a divine Person, you cannot limit Him by any idea of location or anything of that sort.<a name=57:5></a> He inhabits eternity.<a name=57:6></a> He is everywhere.<a name=57:7></a> And when the Lord said, "The Son of man who is in heaven," I have no doubt He was intending to convey the truth of who it was, that was there.<a name=57:8></a> That is the keystone of divine wisdom, that He who is God should become Man, and bring into manhood supreme moral excellence.<a name=57:9></a> God has brought in in Christ an order of manhood that is great enough in personal and moral excellence to satisfy His desires, great enough to express God, and to respond to Him in a perfect way.<a name=57:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then, beloved brethren, that being so, what was in mind in a divine Person becoming Man, was that we might be brought into His life; and so redemption has been accomplished.<a name=57:11></a> That was a necessity.<a name=57:12></a> We read in the next verse, "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, thus must the Son of man be lifted up.<a name=57:13></a>" There was a divine must, because of the condition in which men were, they had become the subjects of sin and all its consequences.<a name=57:14></a> And therefore, if God was to effectuate His thoughts in relation to the sons of men, that matter must be dealt with according to God, sin must be judged; and as to the man who was sinful, his history must be terminated in judgment, and the Lord Jesus went to the cross in order that all that might be done vicariously for man.<a name=57:15></a> If it had been effectuated in us, we should never have emerged
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=58>[Page 58]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		from the judgment of God; but the Son of God came and took vicariously, that is on behalf of others, the place that was ours, in order that the judgment might be borne and exhausted, and God be glorified, and the history of sinful man ended judicially in the cross of Christ.<a name=58:1></a> What for?<a name=58:2></a> In order that God might be free to give us life in Christ, and set us up in life in the heavenly order of manhood, the order of manhood that is according to His original thought, as it says in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:48">1 Corinthians  15:48</a>: "Such as he made of dust, such also those made of dust; and such as the heavenly one, such also the heavenly ones.<a name=58:3></a>" The first man was not God's original thought; he was simply brought in by way of testimony, and that God might work out His thoughts in wonderful grace; but it is not an earthly order of man who has place in heaven.<a name=58:4></a> We have received the spirit of the heavenly One; we live in His life, and are of His order.<a name=58:5></a> But what I am seeking to bring before you is that God having conceived His thoughts in relation to the sons of men brought forward wisdom before setting about to carry them out; the first great step in wisdom being the incarnation.<a name=58:6></a> Not that it was first in point of time, because the foundation of the world came before that.<a name=58:7></a> When we get the expression in Scripture "before the foundation of the world," I believe it always refers to the purpose of God.<a name=58:8></a> God had formed His purposes, and then the foundation of the world comes in with a view to the working of them out.<a name=58:9></a> So in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>the Lord says to the Father, "Thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world"; it was a question of God's purpose.<a name=58:10></a> When it is a question of the personal glory of Christ as having His part in Deity, in equality with the Father, the Lord does not use the expression "before the foundation of the world.<a name=58:11></a>" He uses the expression, "before the world was," <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:5">John  17:5</a>.<a name=58:12></a> "Before the world was," I believe, conveys simply the thought of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=59>[Page 59]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		absolute eternity before time began; but when it is said "before the foundation of the world," it has in view that God had formed a purpose, and that the world was founded with a view to working out that purpose.<a name=59:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now when we come to Colossians and Ephesians, we have the thought of the assembly, and the assembly as the body of Christ.<a name=59:2></a> If you have followed what I have sought to present, and have some little impression of the greatness of what has come in in a divine Person having become Man, and that there is now such a Man before God in the person of our Lord Jesus Christ, a Man in whom, Colossians says, "dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily," you will understand what an immense conception the thought of His body is; that is, that He should have a vessel in which what He is as Man can be expanded with a view to being expressed; not that it adds anything to Him in one sense, although it does in another.<a name=59:3></a> Eve added nothing to Adam, in one sense, because she was wholly derived from him; in that sense she added nothing to him, but on the other hand, she did add something to him, because in her he had a counterpart, a complement, the perfect answer, in feminine features, to himself.<a name=59:4></a> That is the thought, as I understand it, in the body of Christ, which is the assembly.<a name=59:5></a> And this is what we have been taken up for, the assembly, as Paul says in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1">Colossians  1</a>, "for his body, which is the assembly.<a name=59:6></a>" He makes it perfectly clear, that the assembly is Christ's body.<a name=59:7></a> That knowledge, or the light of it, had arrested him years before, it shone upon him from heaven, when the Lord said to him, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?<a name=59:8></a>" Saul was not persecuting Christ personally; he was persecuting the assembly, ravaging it, as Scripture says; but the Lord says, "Why persecutest thou <i>me</i>?<a name=59:9></a>" showing Paul that the assembly here on earth was
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=60>[Page 60]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		His own body, inseparably bound up with Him; so that anyone who touched the assembly touched Christ.<a name=60:1></a> That is what He meant; and so in that way as the Holy Spirit was received by Saul of Tarsus, the light would shine into his soul and expand as he went on.<a name=60:2></a> And now in this day, God is securing this masterpiece of divine wisdom, the assembly, the body of Christ; the vessel that is great enough to express Christ in all His features for the pleasure of God, and also, in the coming day as the city, to express God Himself.<a name=60:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, in connection with that, we get greatly stressed the thought of mystery, and I would urge the youngest to take account of this, that if they are Christians and have received the Holy Spirit, they have their part in something which the wisest men in the earth know nothing of, if they are not Christians.<a name=60:4></a> They have their part in what Scripture speaks of as the mystery: something that God has been pleased to hide from the wise and prudent -- those who profess to be wise and learned in the world -- and which He is working out in the most wonderful way, though the world knows nothing about it.<a name=60:5></a> It says in <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#25">Proverbs  25</a>, "It is the glory of God to conceal a thing; but the glory of kings is to search out a thing.<a name=60:6></a>" The kings are the saints, viewed in their kingly dignity, and it is our honour to search out a thing.<a name=60:7></a> Now we ought to set ourselves to inquire, What is the mystery?<a name=60:8></a> and to look at the Scripture, and see what the mystery means.<a name=60:9></a> It was hidden, now it is all out.<a name=60:10></a> It was given to Paul to bring it out, to complete the word of God, and that involves his bringing to light the mystery.<a name=60:11></a> Now the mystery was this, that God was pleased to work by the gospel in all the nations under the sun, and to attract souls to Christ, and to seal them by the Holy Spirit, and by the Holy Spirit to bind them into one body.<a name=60:12></a> So that out of all those different

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		components drawn from different parts of the earth, having different national characteristics and all that kind of thing, the wisdom of God is forming a wonderful vessel, the assembly, which is to be the vessel in which Christ is to find expression.<a name=61:1></a> This is no theory, it is an actuality.<a name=61:2></a> It is a remarkable testimony to the powerful influence of Christ over millions of people, absolutely diverse in character, that as they are formed under His influence, they are drawn together and held together in holy love.<a name=61:3></a> On the one hand it is a testimony to the wonderful influence of Christ, and on the other hand, it is a testimony to the wonderful power of the Holy Spirit, who also is a divine Person.<a name=61:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is the mystery; and those of us who have been privileged to move about a little in different parts of the earth see it.<a name=61:5></a> If you go to England you see the saints bound together in love, loving Christ, they are all drawn from different social positions in life, they have different temperaments, yet they are all drawn together, they move together, they think the same thing, they say the same thing, they praise God together in the same way.<a name=61:6></a> And if you come to the other side of the earth, you find exactly the same thing; and you go to another part -- to America, perhaps -- and you see exactly the same thing.<a name=61:7></a> It is the mystery.<a name=61:8></a> The world cannot possibly understand it; the world has nothing equal to it.<a name=61:9></a> People say, How is it you have friends all over the world?<a name=61:10></a> You are going somewhere you have never been before, and you have friends there, and are received into their houses without the least difficulty.<a name=61:11></a> How is it?<a name=61:12></a> What does it mean?<a name=61:13></a> It is a mystery to them, they cannot possibly understand; and yet it is a great reality.<a name=61:14></a> It is a wonderful thing, the assembly, the body of Christ; and it is what God is working for, and so the apostle was labouring to present every man perfect in Christ.<a name=61:15></a> Nothing of flesh, of course,

		can have any part in this living organism.<a name=62:1></a> If flesh obtrudes itself, it only spoils.<a name=62:2></a> You see how flesh spoiled the assembly at Corinth.<a name=62:3></a> It was no part of God's purpose that the saints should fall into sin.<a name=62:4></a> There was no expression of Christ in that; no expression of the power of the Holy Spirit in that; no expression of the wisdom of God in that!<a name=62:5></a> It only showed to what a large extent through carelessness and unwatchfulness on the part of the brethren, Satan had gained a foothold.<a name=62:6></a> And Paul laboured, mourned and wept, and sent Timothy among them to bring to their remembrance, "my ways as they are in Christ, according as I teach everywhere in every assembly.<a name=62:7></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Every assembly is to take on the same pattern, and that pattern can only be learned from Christ, and so Paul says he laboured "to present every man perfect in Christ.<a name=62:8></a>" The whole bent of his ministry was that every man was to be built up in the knowledge of Christ and to take character from Christ, the heavenly man, the man of God's purpose, because every believer is to form his part in the body of Christ.<a name=62:9></a> And so he says, "For I would have you know what combat I have for you, and those in Laodicea, and as many as have not seen my face in flesh; to the end that their hearts may be encouraged, being united together in love.<a name=62:10></a>" That is essential if Christ is to come into expression in His body, it is essential that the saints should be united together in love.<a name=62:11></a> If we are disunited, beloved brethren, what expression is there of Christ in that?<a name=62:12></a> You see how it cuts entirely athwart the divine mind, if we are not united together in love!<a name=62:13></a> You may say, we are very diverse, and we rub one another up the wrong way, and so on.<a name=62:14></a> That may be perfectly true as regards what we are naturally, but what about the influence of Christ, and what about the power of the Spirit?<a name=62:15></a> What about the bearing of the cross

		I have in mind, dear brethren, to say a word as to true greatness in manhood according to God; for there is no doubt that what God is seeking to bring about is the development of manhood in the saints; manhood which takes its character, I need not say, from Christ.<a name=67:1></a> We need to have God's own thoughts as to what is truly great, for our natural tendencies are to have our ideas formed -- or at any rate influenced -- by what is in the world around us, whereas God would always keep Christ before the minds and hearts of His people, showing us what is really great according to His estimation.<a name=67:2></a> Paul, towards the close of his course, and as being in prison and having plenty of opportunity to weigh things over, says "Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus; who, subsisting in the form of God, did not esteem it an object of rapine to be on an equality with God; but emptied himself, taking a bondman's form, taking his place in the likeness of men.<a name=67:3></a>" Then, as though that were not enough, so to speak, he says, "having been found in figure as a man, humbled himself, becoming obedient even unto death, and that the death of the cross.<a name=67:4></a>" Then, following on that remarkable presentation of the mind that was in Christ Jesus, the Man of God's purpose and pleasure, he says "Wherefore also God highly exalted him, and granted him a name, that which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of heavenly and earthly and infernal beings.<a name=67:5></a>" God intends to ensure that throughout the whole universe, even including infernal beings, there shall be a public recognition of the One whom He delights to honour.<a name=67:6></a> The world at present is marked by

		One has in mind, by the Lord's help, to seek to indicate three lines on which I believe we may be developed in manhood according to Christ; not, however, that there are not other ways, for even the ministry which the Lord gives from His place of exaltation far above all heavens, is intended to that very end, as we were quoting in prayer, "Until we all arrive .<a name=68:2></a>.<a name=68:3></a>.<a name=68:4></a> at the full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ.<a name=68:5></a>" I think these three passages of Scripture, from Numbers, from Genesis and from Esther, may serve to indicate three ways in which God would develop greatness in the saints.<a name=68:6></a> The first is in having to do with God, and the second is in sowing to the Spirit.<a name=68:7></a> The first produces moral greatness according to Christ; the second produces greatness in spiritual wealth and in spiritual substance; and the third is by means of exercises that arise as having to face evil, especially in the assembly, and as proving faithful in relation to those matters.<a name=68:8></a>

		The first item that God gave instructions to Moses about was the ark.<a name=70:7></a> When it came to constructing the tabernacle, the ark did not come first, but when God gave instructions as to the system in which He could take pleasure and dwell in complacently, the first thing He speaks of to Moses is the ark.<a name=70:8></a> Moses would be impressed as he began to take account of who it was that the ark typified, as God said to him "They shall make an ark of acacia wood; two cubits and a half the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.<a name=70:9></a>" Think of the wondrousness of it, that a divine Person was to become Man, and to enter into such wonderful limitations as are there typified.<a name=70:10></a> They are not great measurements, but well within the compass of man.<a name=70:11></a> He, who was the Creator of heaven and earth, the God who upholds

		It says that "Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold; and Jehovah blessed him"; but then there is not only the idea of sowing, but of digging, and that is evidently the exercise of getting rid of everything that would obstruct the free movement of the Spirit.<a name=75:11></a> He removed what would stand in the way of the water springing up.<a name=75:12></a> The Philistines were always stopping up the wells, that is what the natural mind working in the things of God nearly always does.<a name=75:13></a> It stops up the wells, so that there is no freshness.<a name=75:14></a> The natural mind attempting to compass divine things always robs them of their freshness, and we have to beware of the Philistines.<a name=75:15></a> Any tendency to hold the truth of God merely in the natural mind will fail.<a name=75:16></a> There may be a tendency to take on the truth in terms, and the tendency perhaps to place things in pigeon-holes, so to speak, and all that kind of thing.<a name=75:17></a> The truth of God cannot be held in that way.<a name=75:18></a> It must be held in the Spirit,

		and then it will be in constant freshness, just like a fountain of water springing up.<a name=76:1></a> It says, "Isaac dug again the wells of water that they had dug in the days of Abraham his father, and that the Philistines had stopped after the death of Abraham; and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.<a name=76:2></a>" The truth remains the same, but it is taken up afresh in fresh energy in the Spirit, so that it is held in freshness, in living power and enjoyment.<a name=76:3></a> The names are the same; the truth does not change, but taken up in fresh exercise it is held in a fresh and living way.<a name=76:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As Isaac dug these wells, the herdsmen of Gerar strove with Isaac's herdsmen, and said; "The water is ours .<a name=76:5></a>.<a name=76:6></a>.<a name=76:7></a> And they dug another well, and they strove for that also.<a name=76:8></a>" The Philistine element in ourselves always has to be reckoned with.<a name=76:9></a> Whatever is brought forward in freshness, there is the effort, so to speak, to claim it in the power of the natural mind, and say, 'That is ours,' but then a spiritual person will go on.<a name=76:10></a> Isaac went on.<a name=76:11></a> We must have the truth in freshness.<a name=76:12></a> There is nothing satisfying for the saints or for God if the truth is not held in freshness, so the more the Philistines strove, the more Isaac went on digging further wells, until he comes to a point when there is no more strife.<a name=76:13></a> He reaches the truth in such a way that the Philistines cannot rob him of it, they cannot claim it.<a name=76:14></a> The Lord had made room for them.<a name=76:15></a>

		I just referred to that as a matter which we must carry with us all the time we are here, the importance of seeking to acquire spiritual substance so that we are not poverty-stricken.<a name=76:16></a> Jehovah said, "None shall appear before me empty.<a name=76:17></a>" It is a shame to us if we are barren.<a name=76:18></a> God would not have barrenness in His land, or lack of substance in His house.<a name=76:19></a> The scripture speaks of the fatness of His house, but the enjoyment of that depends on us recognising, of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then finally we come to the history of Mordecai, and he, I believe, represents one who became great because of the way he faced the working of evil.<a name=77:3></a> While we are here, we must expect to have to face the working of evil; not that one is setting a premium on evil in the assembly, far from it, but we have to remember that so long as we are here we are in the presence of hades' gates.<a name=77:4></a> There will be the constant plotting of evil to seek in a skilful and systematic way to nullify what is of God.<a name=77:5></a> We are in the presence of it.<a name=77:6></a> The Lord has said in regard to the assembly that "Hades' gates shall not prevail against it," but hades' gates are there and we must recognise that, hence the need for continual watchfulness.<a name=77:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing that marks Mordecai is this constant watchfulness.<a name=77:8></a> He sat in the king's gate; even after he had been led in triumph through the city as the man whom the king delighted to honour, it says "Mordecai came again to the king's gate.<a name=77:9></a>" Nothing succeeded in diverting Mordecai from sitting in the king's gate.<a name=77:10></a> I understand that the king's gate is simply the principle of judging every matter as to how it affects God.<a name=77:11></a> The gate was always the place of judgment, and Mordecai sitting in the king's gate would be that he was one who had habituated himself to looking at everything as it arose, as to how it affected God.<a name=77:12></a> He would have a spiritual judgment of it from that standpoint; not how it affected himself, but how it affected God; and therefore when these two chamberlains were plotting and seeking to lay hands on king Ahasuerus, Mordecai is aware of it.<a name=77:13></a> There is no working of evil among
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=78>[Page 78]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the saints that God will not expose and make clear to those who are watchful and considering for Him.<a name=78:1></a> It is a very important element to be found in the assembly, that there are those characterised by watchfulness and considering in all things for God, because then the true character of anything that is working secretly will become manifest to such.<a name=78:2></a> "The thing became known to Mordecai, and he related it to Esther the queen, and Esther told it to the king in Mordecai's name.<a name=78:3></a>" The assembly is brought into it, and the matter is taken up before God in purity of motive as considering for God only, for this is what Mordecai represents.<a name=78:4></a> These are important elements; and then inquiry was made, too; care was taken to investigate the matter, so that with these elements there the whole thing is exposed and dealt with in a right way.<a name=78:5></a> But all hangs first of all on Mordecai, who was sitting in the king's gate.<a name=78:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing that marked Mordecai and which constituted an element in his greatness, is what comes out in chapter 3, and that is, that he would not under any circumstances yield to the flesh.<a name=78:7></a> This is very elementary, but it is very essential, and something that has to be maintained by us right through to the end.<a name=78:8></a> One has often referred to the apostle Paul, and one marvels at him.<a name=78:9></a> After he had been caught up to the third heaven and into Paradise; even after that, with all the light he had, and even with the thorn for the flesh to buffet him, he says to the Corinthians "I buffet my body, and lead it captive, lest after having preached to others I should be myself rejected.<a name=78:10></a>" That shows what the flesh is even in an apostle, even in a man who has been into Paradise, and there is no other way of meeting it, but by having war with it.<a name=78:11></a> The element of self-seeking was having a damaging effect.<a name=78:12></a> The whole of the princes were giving way to it.<a name=78:13></a> You may say the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		king had commanded it.<a name=79:1></a> We have to take the history as it stands.<a name=79:2></a> God was in that, in order to bring out what was in Mordecai, and to bring about a great deliverance for His people.<a name=79:3></a> Any element of falsity or untruth that comes in amongst the saints, if it is allowed to go on, will rob God of His pleasure in His people.<a name=79:4></a> What Haman had in mind was to destroy the whole of the Jews.<a name=79:5></a> Haman was not intent simply on his own glory.<a name=79:6></a> All the princes bowed to him, but just one man, Mordecai, stood his ground, and whatever it cost he would not yield to this working of the flesh as set forth in Haman.<a name=79:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These are two elements of greatness in the presence of evil; that is, maintaining the principle of sitting in the king's gate, judging of every matter as to how it affects God, and along with that the purpose of heart that will not yield to the flesh.<a name=79:8></a> We know how successful it was eventually in this history of the book of Esther.<a name=79:9></a> We find that Mordecai is the one who is prominent, and also Esther comes in.<a name=79:10></a> She is the counterpart, so to speak, of Mordecai.<a name=79:11></a> Mordecai stands out as the responsible element; and Esther is the subjective answer to what is seen in Mordecai, for she was brought up by him, and even after she became queen she did as he told her.<a name=79:12></a> She sets forth the results of subjection, and of abiding under the influence of one Man.<a name=79:13></a> That is what characterised Esther, and so, I believe, there are two things of particular importance in her.<a name=79:14></a> She was subjected to a process with a view to being pleasing to the king; "six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with spices.<a name=79:15></a>" One would say this to all the brethren, young and old, brothers and sisters, that one great thing to be pursued is to consider and cultivate what is pleasing to God.<a name=79:16></a> There is nothing spectacular about that.<a name=79:17></a> It may involve a considerable process of training.<a name=79:18></a> "Six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with spices" may have seemed a long

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		while to Esther, but it had in view her becoming pleasing to the king.<a name=80:1></a> We can only cultivate that under the influence of one Man, and Esther secretly was under the influence of Mordecai.<a name=80:2></a> Actually she was in the charge of Hegai, the one who was placed over the virgins, possibly typical of the Spirit, and then as being pleasing to the king she acquired power with the king.<a name=80:3></a> The more pleasing we are to God, the more power we shall have with Him.<a name=80:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So another thing comes into view.<a name=80:5></a> When a crisis arises she is prepared to lay down her life for the brethren.<a name=80:6></a>' She must go into the king whatever it costs, and she says "If I perish, I perish"; and then she puts on her queenly robes and goes in to the king, and the king holds out to her the golden sceptre, and Esther touches it.<a name=80:7></a> I believe God, so to speak, would set before us a golden standard, the standard of the divine nature.<a name=80:8></a> Do we love the brethren?<a name=80:9></a> If we love them we ought to lay down our lives for them.<a name=80:10></a> "Hereby we have known love, because <i>he</i> has laid down his life for us; and <i>we</i> ought for the brethren to lay down our lives.<a name=80:11></a>" Am I up to this standard?<a name=80:12></a> If I am, I shall have power with God.<a name=80:13></a> If you love the brethren you will have power with God in relation to them.<a name=80:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Esther drew near and touched the golden sceptre, and the king gave her her request.<a name=80:15></a> Esther's power with the king was largely the effect of Mordecai's influence, so in the verses read in chapters 8 and 9 the Spirit of God enlarges on the glory and greatness of Mordecai.<a name=80:16></a> In chapter 8 it says that "Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white.<a name=80:17></a>" That is very suggestive.<a name=80:18></a> It is the day of his vindication.<a name=80:19></a> It is not at present the day of our vindication, save in a moral sense perhaps, at times; but there is this royal apparel of blue and white, the heavenly colour and what is pure, and "with a mantle of byssus and purple.<a name=80:20></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=81>[Page 81]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this is very suggestive of the greatness of Mordecai as developed in the presence of evil, and then in chapter 9 it says, "Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame went forth throughout the provinces; for this man Mordecai became continually greater.<a name=81:1></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is all one had to say, dear brethren.<a name=81:2></a> One trusts it may be serviceable, and may stimulate with us the desire for that true greatness which is of God, and according to Christ, and in which God Himself is glorified.<a name=81:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Each of these passages, beloved brethren, presents to us a woman who was attracted to one who is a type of Christ, and as to whom it is said, "she became his wife.<a name=82:1></a>" Hence each of them presents, in some distinctive way, features that are proper to the assembly.<a name=82:2></a> We have been speaking together of the assembly and of God's own thoughts regarding it; and it is a very affecting consideration for each of us who have been reached by the gospel and who have received the Holy Spirit, that God in taking us up has had nothing less in mind for us than that we should form part of the assembly.<a name=82:3></a> It is well, therefore, to get a definite impression in our minds as to what the assembly is, what it is intended to be, what it is in the mind of God and what it is to the heart of Christ.<a name=82:4></a> It is good for us to get such definite impressions in our minds, because if we do, we shall have intelligence as to the end to which God is working in all His ways with us; for God, having picked us up for a definite purpose, is consistently working to reach that end.<a name=82:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And I would also say this, that while the assembly is a corporate idea, for it is the body of Christ, composed of many members, yet if the assembly is to possess the features which God intends it should possess, we who form it must in effect take on those features individually.<a name=82:6></a> There is no miraculous way, so to speak, in which the assembly comes into being as possessed of certain features, if those who compose it are not marked by those features; and hence as understanding from Scripture what features are proper to the assembly in relation to Christ, it should induce exercise with us each one, that
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=83>[Page 83]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		something of those features might have place with us individually.<a name=83:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, while the assembly is viewed at first as the result of divine workmanship, according to <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:22">Genesis  2:22</a>, God does not work, if I may use the expression, mechanically.<a name=83:2></a> He works in the intelligence and affections of those whom He has in hand, and the great lever by means of which He operates with us is the attractiveness of Christ.<a name=83:3></a> I have no doubt as to that, that one great means by which God operates in the souls of His people, is the attractiveness of Christ, and that is what comes to light in these two scriptures we have read, and, of course, in many other scriptures as well.<a name=83:4></a> David, on the one hand, was attractive to Abigail, resulting in her repudiating Nabal and repudiating Saul and moving out to David; and moving out to him as already having taken on certain features that were in keeping with David and pleasing to him, and it says of her that she became his wife.<a name=83:5></a> Similarly, also with Rebecca.<a name=83:6></a> There is no question that the result of the ministry of Abraham's servant, who is typical of the Holy Spirit, was to make Isaac supremely attractive to Rebecca, so that although she had never seen him, she was prepared to move out to him.<a name=83:7></a> That indeed, beloved brethren, is characteristic of the present moment, for we can all take up the language of the apostle Peter in his epistle in regard of Christ, when he said, "Whom, having not seen, ye love; on whom though not now looking, but believing, ye exult with joy unspeakable and filled with the glory.<a name=83:8></a>" It is a remarkable testimony to the attractiveness of Christ that He is wielding an influence over tens of thousands, and has wielded an influence over millions, of people who have never seen Him; it is a remarkable thing, but an undeniable fact.<a name=83:9></a> It is one of the elements in what is called the mystery, for we have to acquaint ourselves with the idea of mystery.<a name=83:10></a> Satan has his

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The feature that comes to light in Abigail is that she has the appreciation of God's anointed, the man of God's choice.<a name=84:3></a> The man after God's own heart becomes Abigail's choice, and in the power of that she repudiates both Nabal and Saul, and indeed repudiates herself, for she says, "Upon me .<a name=84:4></a>.<a name=84:5></a>.<a name=84:6></a> let this iniquity be.<a name=84:7></a>" In the case of Rebecca; the characteristic feature is that she is prepared to commit herself to what is spiritual and to renounce what is natural.<a name=84:8></a> These are two great lines upon which the Spirit of God would move us at the present time.<a name=84:9></a> He would use, on the one hand, the existence in this world of what is opposed to Christ to develop in us that appreciation of Christ and affection for Him which would break away from all that denies Him His rights, in order to our being wholly for one Man -- Christ.<a name=84:10></a> On the other hand, He would operate in our souls in the power of the attractiveness of Christ to lead us to prefer what is spiritual to what is natural.<a name=84:11></a>

		relinquishing nothing that was due to God.<a name=101:1></a> So the closing chapters of the gospels which delineate for us the sufferings of Christ at the hands of men, are a great study for us.<a name=101:2></a> In chapters 26 and 27 of Matthew, we find that before the high priests and before the governor, the Lord is asked certain questions which are on the line of personal accusations and He answers nothing; but when questions are asked involving the testimony, immediately the Lord answers.<a name=101:3></a> Immediately it is a question of the testimony, He must speak.<a name=101:4></a> Whatever was involved, He would be faithful to God, and He would meet the position in faithfulness in the position of suffering.<a name=101:5></a> But in personal accusations the Lord answered nothing.<a name=101:6></a> The governor, I suppose, had never had anyone before him before who answered nothing; it says, "the governor wondered exceedingly.<a name=101:7></a>" That gives an idea of the characteristics of the Lamb.<a name=101:8></a> One who would die rather than surrender any item of the rights of God.<a name=101:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What I am leading to is that if we are to have our place in the day of the marriage of the Lamb, if we are to stand by His side as the Lamb's wife when He is publicly vindicated, it necessitates that we are in our turn to suffer rather than surrender anything that is right in the sight of God, and that, I believe, is a feature of the testimony which the Lord will bring into prominence in these closing days.<a name=101:10></a> It says in the gospel of Luke that when the days of His receiving up were fulfilled, the Lord set His face steadfastly to go to Jerusalem.<a name=101:11></a> In the full understanding of what would be involved.<a name=101:12></a> He set His face steadfastly, and now we have arrived at a time that corresponds with this in the history of the testimony, and there is the final phase of the testimony to be completed, having in view taking on the features of the Lamb's wife, that we may stand beside the Lamb in the day of His public glory, and

		And so in chapter seven we have this company which is referred to in verse nine.<a name=102:7></a> "A great crowd, which no one could number, out of every nation and tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes and palm branches in their hands!<a name=102:8></a> The palms are, of course, symbolical of victory.<a name=102:9></a> They stand before the Lamb.<a name=102:10></a> He takes account of them.<a name=102:11></a> He supports them and one of the elders in answer to John says, "These are they who come out of the great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and have made them white in the blood of the Lamb.<a name=102:12></a>" That is, in the presence of all that Satan brings to pass on the earth with a view to overthrowing the faithful few, and in these worst days that will ever have arisen on the earth, there is this great company that no one can number which God brings to light.<a name=102:13></a> We may rest assured that if conditions necessitating suffering, if we are to be faithful, do arise, it is not

		We were speaking together this afternoon, dear brethren, of the heavenly character of Christianity, and I have turned to the epistle to the Hebrews because in this epistle we are addressed in the beginning of chapter 3 as partakers of the heavenly calling, and the first two chapters are intended to attract us by presenting Christ to us personally as in heaven, in the double character of Apostle, on the one hand, and High Priest, on the other, of our confession.<a name=108:1></a> And then at the end of chapter 12 we have an exhortation to see that we refuse not Him who is speaking from heaven.<a name=108:2></a> The epistle opens with the fact that God is speaking, and chapter 12 urges us, near the end of the epistle, to see that we refuse not Him that speaks.<a name=108:3></a> The passage in chapter 12 which we have read takes up the path of faith in which we are all set at the present time, and the ways of God in regard of us in that path.<a name=108:4></a> I have in mind that we should lay hold at the present time of heavenly things, and enter into our portion as sons, which is in God's mind for us, and that we should not be hindered by anything that the world or the flesh or even nature might bring in.<a name=108:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, now, the epistle starts with the thought that God has spoken, and in a distinctive way; as it says, "in Son.<a name=108:6></a>" He had previously spoken by prophets, but now no less a one than the Son Himself has come into view, and He Himself is the Speaker.<a name=108:7></a> He speaks to us; He appeals to us by bringing Himself before our hearts, that we may learn in Him what God's thoughts toward us are.<a name=108:8></a> It is a very important thing to understand, dear brethren, that the mind of God is that we should have our attention directed to Christ in glory, and should

		understand that He sets forth in Himself, and would convey to our understanding, what God intends we should be brought into.<a name=109:1></a> I think if a moment's consideration is given to that it will become clear, because Jesus is God Himself, the second Person of the Godhead, but He has become Man.<a name=109:2></a> Why should He do that?<a name=109:3></a> Obviously it was not necessary, so to speak, unless men were in mind for blessing.<a name=109:4></a> Unless men were in mind there was no object, so to speak, in one Person of the Godhead becoming Man and taking up manhood condition.<a name=109:5></a> And so the whole intent of God is that the Son having come into view as having become Man, and now having taken His place at the right hand of the Majesty on high, that should arrest our attention and that we should inquire, so to speak, What is it that God is showing to us in these wonderful facts?<a name=109:6></a> What are we intended to learn by it?<a name=109:7></a> And so it says that "God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son (or in the Son).<a name=109:8></a>" Notice these last days, which have extended from the day of Pentecost, for the speaking, I suppose, really began with the coming down of the Holy Spirit.<a name=109:9></a> I do not doubt, of course, that there was a speaking of God to men in the presence here of the Lord Jesus in the days of His flesh, but I believe the speaking in its fulness dates from the coming of the Spirit, because the whole point is that we are to understand what God is saying in the fact that Jesus is now to be apprehended in a position in heaven as Man.<a name=109:10></a> So the speaking has extended for nearly two thousand years, and it is called "these last days.<a name=109:11></a>" That is, there is nothing, so to speak, to follow.<a name=109:12></a> The Lord said in the parable, "Last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son," <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#21:37">Matthew  21:37</a>.<a name=109:13></a> There could be nothing to come after the Son.<a name=109:14></a>

		John, at the end of his first epistle, says, "We know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding.<a name=110:1></a>" There is nothing to follow, but then in order that our attention might be further arrested, the Spirit of God enlarges on the greatness of Christ.<a name=110:2></a> He says, Whom God has appointed heir of all things.<a name=110:3></a> Think of that, this forward look into the future, that in a day soon to come Christ is to inherit all things.<a name=110:4></a> All things in heaven and earth are to be taken up by Him and held by Him for the pleasure of God.<a name=110:5></a> And then there is a backward look, it says, "by whom also he made the worlds.<a name=110:6></a>" We know not how many worlds there are, but however many there are they were all created by the Son.<a name=110:7></a> Hence in the consideration of this forward look on the one hand, that He is the appointed heir of all things, and this backward look on the other hand, that by Him God made the worlds, we are intended to be arrested as to the greatness of the Person who is now appealing to us to engage our attention.<a name=110:8></a> And then it makes another remarkable statement, "who being the effulgence of his glory and the expression of his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power.<a name=110:9></a>" That is the present time.<a name=110:10></a> We have had a forward look and a backward look, and now there is something that fits into the present, and that is that the Son in whom God has spoken to us is no less than the One who at the present time is upholding all things by the word of His power.<a name=110:11></a> A remarkable statement intending to impress us with the greatness of Christ, and to impress us with the fact that God is calling attention to Christ in the present position that He fills as Man in the presence of God, that we might understand what God is saying to us in Him.<a name=110:12></a> And then it adds, when He had by Himself purged our sins, or having made by Himself the purification of sins.<a name=110:13></a> A few words but full of meaning.<a name=110:14></a> Who else

		Now that is the position from which He is addressing Himself to us.<a name=111:8></a> God is speaking to us in the Son, and the Holy Spirit will also speak to us in the matter, for when we come to chapter 3 we read, "Wherefore, even as says the Holy Spirit, Today if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.<a name=111:9></a>" It is urgent that we should take account of the way God is speaking in these last days.<a name=111:10></a> So Christ having come in in the greatness of His Person, and having set Himself down on the right hand of the majesty on high, in the value of all that He has accomplished in making purification of sins, it says, "taking a place by so much better than the angels, as he inherits a name more excellent than they.<a name=111:11></a>" The writer of the epistle is writing to Christians who had been Jews, and who in that capacity had been accustomed to God speaking to them by angels.<a name=111:12></a> Angels are wonderful creatures, infinitely greater and more powerful than man.<a name=111:13></a> They are not mortal.<a name=111:14></a> He makes His angels spirits, it says, His ministers a flame of fire.<a name=111:15></a> We read of Gabriel in the book of Daniel, and hundreds of years later we find that

		Now what is involved in the name?<a name=113:5></a> The first thing is, "Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.<a name=113:6></a>" That is the very first thing, so to speak, that God would call our attention to in relation to Christ, that He hails Him as His Son.<a name=113:7></a> "Thou art my Son," He says, indicating clearly that what God had in mind for men was that they should be brought into the place of sons.<a name=113:8></a> Now of recent years, dear brethren, we have heard a great deal about sonship, and rightly so too, but one just fears lest we should become so used to the expression that we should fail to apprehend the magnitude of it, that God has nothing less in mind than that men should stand before Him in sonship, and with a view to that, the second Person of the Godhead came into manhood, and as having become man is saluted by God as His Son.<a name=113:9></a> And then there is something further, He says, "I will be to him for father, and he shall, be to me for son.<a name=113:10></a>" That means that not only is sonship in mind for man, but it is to be sonship filled out with the reciprocated affections proper to sonship.<a name=113:11></a> "I will be to him for father and he shall be to me for son.<a name=113:12></a>" It is not going to be a mere matter of title, it is not going to be an abstract idea, it is going to be a position which will be filled out with the reciprocal affections proper to the position.<a name=113:13></a> Well now, God is speaking to us in all this.<a name=113:14></a> Have we apprehended that that is God's thought for us?<a name=113:15></a> How far are we in sonship practically, I mean actually in the liberty of it?<a name=113:16></a> How far are we in the enjoyment of the affections proper to it?<a name=113:17></a> All this is intended, dear brethren, not to place us in bondage, far from it, but rather to induce exercise on our part, that if

		God is thus speaking to us, evidently He desires and intends that we should come into it.<a name=114:1></a> You remember in the well-known passage in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15">Luke  15</a>, that the younger son, as he returned, had in mind to suggest that he should become a hired servant; but what does the father say?<a name=114:2></a> He says, "Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet.<a name=114:3></a>" That is to say, he has nothing less in mind than the best, and not simply to be brought out, as an abstract idea, but to be put on the young man, so that he would be actually clothed with the best robe and would have the ring on his hand, and as having the shoes on his feet would move in the liberty proper to him as a son.<a name=114:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And so it says, "because ye are sons, God has sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father.<a name=114:5></a>" That is not a matter to be taken up, dear brethren, in mere words.<a name=114:6></a> The words are of no value if the affections and feelings that go with the words as uttered by the Lord Jesus are not present with us.<a name=114:7></a> But then God has nothing less in His mind than that the position of sonship which is set before us objectively in Jesus glorified in the presence of God, should be filled out by us with the actual affections and feelings and liberty that are proper to it, and if we have received the Holy Spirit, we have in the Spirit the potentiality for entering fully into these things.<a name=114:8></a> If we are conscious that our actual measure in them is small, that is something that we might well take up in private exercise with the Lord, because the Lord is prepared to help us into these things, and the Spirit is prepared to do so also, and the one that asks receives, the one that seeks finds, the one that knocks will have things opened to him; but the one that is dilatory and careless will have nothing opened to him.<a name=114:9></a>

		Well now, I did not read the rest of the quotations in chapter 1, they bring in various glories which are all gathered up in the Person of the Son at the right hand of God.<a name=115:6></a> You will find that they involve that His throne is for ever and ever because it is founded in righteousness.<a name=115:7></a> It is established on moral foundations so that it can never be shaken; and moreover He Himself is anointed with oil of gladness above His companions.<a name=115:8></a> That is, it is a system of joy into which we are introduced, and Christ is supreme in it.<a name=115:9></a> And then it is a system that will never pass away, because it depends on Him as to whom it is said, "Thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.<a name=115:10></a>" It is a question of the greatness of Christianity, the system of blessing and glory which is brought in in the Person of Christ.<a name=115:11></a> And His years shall never fail, and we as linked up with Him by the Spirit will find ourselves with Him in eternal blessing.<a name=115:12></a>

		Now God, it says, is bringing many sons to glory.<a name=117:5></a> Glory is the shining out of what God is in the blessedness of His love, and in His wisdom and power as subservient to His love.<a name=117:6></a> And bringing many sons to glory has in mind that He would have those before Him who can respond appreciatively to the glory in which He is revealed.<a name=117:7></a> You will remember when He said the foundations of earth He had in angels those who were called sons of God, and they shouted for joy.<a name=117:8></a> That is, those who were the masterpiece of His creatorial power celebrated His glory seen in the founding of the earth.<a name=117:9></a> But now God has come out in the shining out of His love.<a name=117:10></a> What other explanation can there be, but that God is love, that He should desire that we should be set up in the place of sons before Him?<a name=117:11></a> And then along with His love there is His wonderful wisdom, involving the incarnation, and there is also the greatness of His power seen in resurrection and the mighty working in the saints of the Spirit.<a name=117:12></a> And so God is bringing many sons to glory, that there might be in them a response suited to that glory.<a name=117:13></a> But then there was something further that was befitting to God, and that was the <i>depths</i> of divine love, expressed in suffering, should also be brought out, and so it became God "in bringing many sons to glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.<a name=117:14></a>" It was necessary, that the one in whom divine thoughts were to be set out in their fulness should reach that position by way of sufferings, in order that the depths of which divine love is capable should be brought to

		Now what is it to live by faith?<a name=119:2></a> It is not simply walking in confidence in God, it is that you are governed, as regards the way you shape your course, by the light of unseen things.<a name=119:3></a> God has given you light in your soul as to another world, and you regulate your course by that light, the light of a world that subsists in relation to One as to whom it is said, "Thou art the same and thy years shall not fail.<a name=119:4></a>" So we are to run with patience the race that is set before us, and to look off unto Jesus, the Leader and Completer of faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross.<a name=119:5></a> Let us think of that, the Lord is presented to us as having had a joy set before Him.<a name=119:6></a> I do not know whether one would state dogmatically what the joy was, because if one did so one might limit it.<a name=119:7></a> I suspect that the great joy set before Him was the joy of bringing into effect all the will of God, and that would include the assembly, what we are to the heart of Christ, but I believe that the joy set before the heart of Christ was the joy of bringing into effect all that God had in His mind to secure.<a name=119:8></a> Now Satan made it as difficult for Him as possible, and both directly and through men sought to overcome Him, but for the joy that was set before Him He endured the cross.<a name=119:9></a> Think of what the cross was, the reproach of it, the public contempt of it and all that was met by Him.<a name=119:10></a> And then, of course, what is meant as the judgment of God, too.<a name=119:11></a> He <i>endured</i> the cross, and <i>despised</i> the shame.<a name=119:12></a> How easily we shrink from a little shame or suffering.<a name=119:13></a> In order to go through we are to look steadfastly on Jesus, "who endured the cross, having despised the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.<a name=119:14></a>" That is, He has reached the terminus, and it is a terminus of power and glory

		We were speaking this afternoon, dear brethren, of the importance of the priests feeding on the oblation, and also on the sin offering, and you might say that in principle feeding on the oblation involves that our souls are formed in the appreciation of the second man, while feeding on the sin offering involves that we are developed in the power to judge and repudiate the first man, and that is what I seek grace to develop a little this evening.<a name=122:1></a> That is a line on which God is working with us all, to develop with us appreciation of Christ, and at the same time to develop the readiness and ability to refuse what is not of Christ, and that idea is largely connected with the thought of the threshing floor, which we have brought before us in the first and last passages that I have read.<a name=122:2></a> In the reference to the Lord thoroughly purging his floor it is a threshing floor, and the fan in His hand is a winnowing fan.<a name=122:3></a> The idea of a threshing floor is the separation of the wheat from the chaff with a view to the retention of the wheat, while the idea of a winnowing fan is similar, but has in view the getting rid of the chaff.<a name=122:4></a>

		It may be that our circumstances are, as men would say, very ordinary, and we might feel we would like to do great things for the Lord, but it is an important thing to realise that even the Son of God was here for thirty years in the ordinary circumstances of human life ordered for Him of God, placed in relation to parents who lived at Nazareth, brought up by them, working in a carpenter's shop as a carpenter.<a name=125:7></a> All this, people would say, was very ordinary, but in those circumstances, over a period of thirty years, God found His delight in Him.<a name=125:8></a> It is not a question of great things being done.<a name=125:9></a> If the Lord wills it, great things may be done in due time, but the point is to be faithful in that which is least.<a name=125:10></a> We shall never be faithful in that which is great if we do not learn to be faithful in that which is least.<a name=125:11></a> And it is in the ordinary conditions of human life, home life, school life, business life, and all the ordinary conditions that God appoints for His children, it is in these, in the first place, that we have to learn to be pleasing to God, and we can learn to be pleasing to God in them as keeping near to Christ and taking character from Him.<a name=125:12></a> He has filled them out in

		Having said that much by way of introduction, I want to refer briefly to these incidents in Jacob's history, because Jacob is taken up in Scripture as a type of the believer.<a name=126:13></a> As the subject of God's ways with him in formation; indeed, Jacob's end, so far as the record goes, is even greater than Abraham's.<a name=126:14></a>

		I am not suggesting that Jacob was a greater man than Abraham, but the end of Jacob is delineated for us and he is seen to be a man of great spiritual power, one who was wholly pleasing to God, finishing up as a worshipper and a great blesser.<a name=127:1></a> That is how Jacob finishes, and that shows the kind of product that God has in mind to secure with every one of us.<a name=127:2></a> Well now, as we come to chapter 32 God is beginning to take Jacob in hand in a definite way.<a name=127:3></a> He had had him in hand already, but Jacob had gone his own way for twenty years and now the time had come, so to speak, when God decides to take things in hand definitely, and so in the previous chapter He told Jacob to go back to the land.<a name=127:4></a> Jacob obeyed, and as he comes to Mahanaim he sends messengers to meet his brother, and receives word that Esau is coming to meet him and four hundred men with him.<a name=127:5></a> Now this is a serious matter for Jacob, for he remembers that twenty years before he had acted unbecomingly to his brother.<a name=127:6></a> It is quite true that the motive underlying his actions was a good one, that is he valued the blessing and he wanted to get it, but at the same time he supplanted his brother and deceived his father, too.<a name=127:7></a> And now the time has come when God is going to raise this matter with him.<a name=127:8></a> His brother had been so offended that he even wanted to murder him, and now Jacob hears that he is coming to meet him and four hundred men with him.<a name=127:9></a> The matter is assuming very serious proportions.<a name=127:10></a> It is one thing to meet an offended brother by himself, and another to meet that brother with four hundred men on his side.<a name=127:11></a> God is causing this matter to appear in very serious proportions, and that is exactly how things do appear, dear brethren, things that we have done that are wrong, when we get into the presence of God.<a name=127:12></a> They may seem very trifling when we do them, but when we get into the presence of.<a name=127:13></a> God they assume serious proportions, and God

	<div class="paragraph">
		There can be no progress in us unless things are faced according to God.<a name=128:3></a> And therefore it says that Jacob said, "O God of my father Abraham.<a name=128:4></a>" Now he is cast upon God, he is beginning to face things with God in exercise, and he calls upon God and reminds Him of what He had promised, and how He had told him to return to the land, and he says, "I am too small for all the loving-kindness and all the faithfulness that thou hast shown unto thy servant.<a name=128:5></a>" He is acknowledging all that.<a name=128:6></a> All that is to the good, and he reminds God of His promises, how He had said, "I will certainly deal well with thee, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.<a name=128:7></a>" That is to say in his soul he is holding on to the promises of God.<a name=128:8></a> It is a good thing for us to do that, dear brethren; we have the light in our souls from the Scriptures of what God has taken us up for, indeed before the foundation of the world he has marked us out for something, "according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love.<a name=128:9></a>" He did that before the world was founded, and now we come to face practical exercises with Him.<a name=128:10></a> You may say, I do not know much about sonship; I do not know much about the liberty of it; I do not know much about the joy of it; I do not know much about being holy and without blame before God in love.<a name=128:11></a> We can, so to speak, remind God of what He has committed Himself to, not that He is ever likely to depart from it, at the same time He loves to see us hold Him to what He has said concerning us.<a name=128:12></a> So Jacob gets to God about these matters.<a name=128:13></a> He asks to be delivered from his brother Esau, and bases his plea on the fact that God has sovereignly said that He will bless him and make

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As having the Spirit, Jacob is ennobled; he is a prince of God, and that is what every saint is who has the Spirit of God.<a name=130:3></a> I have no doubt, if one may venture to refer to it, that the members of the Royal family in England have been brought up having in view what they are, that they should learn to behave and move in a way that befits royalty.<a name=130:4></a> And if we understand what we are as princes of God as having received the Spirit, we have something to keep in mind, a standard before us, to be learned in Christ, of what is befitting those who are thus dignified of God.<a name=130:5></a> Are we going to demean ourselves by being marked by the self-will or pettiness or ambition that may have previously marked us, or are we going to appreciate that there is now just one Man before God in whom He finds delight, and that His intention is that we should derive life and character and impulse from that Man?<a name=130:6></a> And so God says, "Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel, for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.<a name=130:7></a>" And then Jacob asks Him His name, but God does not tell him His name then.<a name=130:8></a> He is going to tell him that later on when he is ready for it, but at the moment He just blesses.<a name=130:9></a> The point reached is sufficient for the moment and has to be consolidated.<a name=130:10></a> As Ruth says to Naomi, "Where thou goest I will go, where thou lodgest I will lodge.<a name=130:11></a>" That means, that you understand that

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, we pass on to chapter 35, and it says in verse 9 that God appeared unto Jacob again.<a name=131:10></a> Jacob has now reached Bethel.<a name=131:11></a> God told him to go up to Bethel.<a name=131:12></a> It is a great thing to understand that we belong to the house of God for that is what Bethel means, the house of God.<a name=131:13></a> We belong to it, but indeed we are it.<a name=131:14></a> We "are builded together," it says, "for an habitation of God through the Spirit.<a name=131:15></a>" We are always the house of God and not simply when we are assembled together.<a name=131:16></a> We are the house of God by reason of the fact that God is dwelling in us by the Spirit, and we must therefore remember that there is behaviour becoming in the house of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now God is making His own name known, and is giving Jacob enlargement.<a name=132:8></a> "Be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee; and kings shall come out of thy loins.<a name=132:9></a> And the land that I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.<a name=132:10></a>" That is to say, God is now making Himself known to him in the sovereignty of His love.<a name=132:11></a> What reason was there why God should do this for Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and their seed after them?<a name=132:12></a> No other reason than that He was pleased to do it sovereignly, and that is exactly our position as we are brought to know God.<a name=132:13></a> It is a good thing that we should have our relations with God coloured by that wonderful light.<a name=132:14></a> You can understand the apostle saying, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ" as he took account of all that God has pledged Himself to be and to bring us into, simply because it is the good pleasure of His will to do so.<a name=132:15></a> We may as well accept it; it will greatly increase our appreciation of God.<a name=132:16></a> It will greatly enhance our ability to worship God, to serve Him acceptably, if we give ourselves to think of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we come to chapter 46.<a name=133:8></a> I only want to speak very briefly on the two remaining scriptures, but here we come to a further point in Israel's history.<a name=133:9></a> He is nearing the end, although in fact he lived for 17 years after this point that we read of in chapter 46.<a name=133:10></a> But he is now typically in the light of Christ in glory and his life is henceforth to be bound up with Him and all that is His.<a name=133:11></a> He has had to go through a good deal of exercise to bring him to this point.<a name=133:12></a> We may, beloved brethren, know what it is to arrive in the experience of our souls at the repudiation of the first man and the appreciation of Christ, and we may be formed according to Christ in very considerable measure, and yet we may be in danger of living in natural things instead of understanding that the grace of God has linked us up with Christ and the assembly and that the Christ's things are ours.<a name=133:13></a> As it says in Colossians, "Seek the things which are above, where the Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God.<a name=133:14></a>" For it says, "Ye have died, and your life is hid with the Christ in God.<a name=133:15></a>" That is, all our life and interests are now bound up with Christ, and His interest is in the assembly, which He holds for

	<div class="paragraph">
		Himself and for God.<a name=134:1></a> And so the latter part of Jacob's history, I believe, sets forth the exercises that he had to go through in order to be rooted up from finding his life in his own things, which only tend to disappointment, and to move over in his interests and affections to find his life in that which Christ has in the assembly.<a name=134:2></a> But now he has come to it, and he says, "Now let me die, after I have seen thy face, since thou still livest.<a name=134:3></a>" He has come to real contentment.<a name=134:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a great thing for us to come to true contentment in any little measure.<a name=134:5></a> Whatever happens here, the assembly as bound up with Christ is going through.<a name=134:6></a> He is at the right hand of God, and the grace of God has linked us up with Him and the system that takes character from Him.<a name=134:7></a> The assembly is a sphere which is morally above, and which Christ has here for the pleasure of God, and it is to take character wholly from Him, so that "there is not Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondman, freeman; but Christ is everything and in all.<a name=134:8></a>" It is the place for Christ and Christ only to be seen.<a name=134:9></a> And so Jacob says, "Now let me die, after I have seen thy face, since thou still livest.<a name=134:10></a>" He has been progressing in his soul.<a name=134:11></a> He is now satisfied with Christ.<a name=134:12></a> He is something like the fathers that we read of in John's first epistle who "have known him that is from the beginning.<a name=134:13></a>" Jacob has arrived at true fatherhood according to God.<a name=134:14></a> The work of God has been progressing on the lines of the threshing floor, on the line of the separation of the wheat from the chaff so that the wheat may stand out.<a name=134:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This work has been going on with Jacob and it has almost reached completion and now Jacob dies and is buried, and it is a remarkable thing that when he is buried it says "they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan.<a name=134:16></a>" It is as though

		We were speaking this morning of the cross of Christ and of the answer to it in the Spirit, and I wish to follow on that line a little this afternoon, and to show that, as the import of the cross of Christ is apprehended and its power known by the Spirit, we are able to take account of the saints, ourselves among them, of course, in a double way, which is suggested in the words which we get in each of the four of Balaam's prophecies regarding <i>Jacob and Israel</i>.<a name=136:1></a> I have only read from two of those prophecies, but it will be found that in each of the four the people of God are referred to both as Jacob and as Israel.<a name=136:2></a> Jacob does not necessarily mean the supplanter, but sometimes stands for the people of God here as in testimony and responsibility according to the will of God, so at the end of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#78">Psalm  78</a>we read that David was taken from the sheepfolds to feed Jacob His people, God's people, and Israel His inheritance.<a name=136:3></a> That is what I have in mind, that Jacob and Israel come into view following on the brazen serpent and the springing well; Jacob being God's people as here in testimony according to His will, answering to what we have in the first epistle to the Corinthians, and Israel being God's inheritance; that is, the saints of God in their dignity in sonship as ministering to His pleasure, answering to what we have in Ephesians.<a name=136:4></a>

		Abraham, speaking to God, said, "I have ventured to speak .<a name=143:5></a>.<a name=143:6></a>.<a name=143:7></a> I, who am dust and ashes.<a name=143:8></a>" And so the saints are not boastful; they have learned the cross of Christ.<a name=143:9></a> They have learned to recognise that in themselves they are dying people, so to speak, but then "who can count the dust of Jacob?<a name=143:10></a>" that is, the immense wealth that the Lord has in those who have fallen asleep.<a name=143:11></a> In one moment they will all be raised in His own likeness, and what a glorious distinguished company it will be then.<a name=143:12></a> And then in the next passage we read; it says, "He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob neither hath he seen wrong in Israel.<a name=143:13></a>" God is entitled to look at His people according to what they are in Christ.<a name=143:14></a> He is entitled, if He pleases, to close His eyes to anything in their behaviour that is unbecoming; not that I am making light of it, far from it; nor will God make light of it, far from it; but on the other hand He is entitled to close His eyes to all that, for all that has been met in the cross of Christ, and He is entitled to view them entirely as apart from it all in Christ for His own pleasure.<a name=143:15></a> "He hath not beheld," it says, "iniquity in Jacob neither hath he seen wrong in Israel.<a name=143:16></a>" That was God's answer to Balaam's effort, the effort of an enemy to curse the people of God.<a name=143:17></a> Balaam has to say, "I have received commandment to bless; and he hath blessed and I cannot reverse it.<a name=143:18></a>" Hence, if that is how God views the saints let us see to it that we view them in the same way; that we do not regard them according to what God is not looking at, but that we

		<a name=144>[Page 144]</a>
	</div>

		regard them according to what they are in His sight.<a name=144:1></a> And he says further, "According to this time," that is, at the end of the wilderness journey, "it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!<a name=144:2></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now to enlarge a little on what answers to Jacob and Israel, I have read these passages from Corinthians and Ephesians.<a name=144:3></a> In Corinthians the saints are viewed as God's people.<a name=144:4></a> You will remember that when God first sent Moses to Pharaoh He told him to say, "Israel is my son, my firstborn.<a name=144:5></a> And I say to thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me," <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#4:22">Exodus  4:22</a>, 23.<a name=144:6></a> God's first thought was a son and the service of a son, and then on subsequent occasions when Moses was sent to Pharaoh his message was "Let my people go, that they may serve me," <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#7:16">Exodus  7:16</a>; <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#8:1">Exodus  8:1</a>, 20.<a name=144:7></a> The thought of a people connects itself with the service of God in the wilderness, while the thought of sons connects itself with the service of God in the land, and that is what is in view in these two epistles.<a name=144:8></a> You will notice that in each of them Paul calls himself an apostle by the will of God, showing that the truth that he was about to open up was specially important as definitely linked in his mind with the will of God.<a name=144:9></a> So this matter of the people of God here in testimony, the assembly of God in a place, on the one hand; and then this matter of sonship according to God's eternal purpose, applying to saints universally, on the other hand; both refer to the saints according to God's will.<a name=144:10></a> So in 1 Corinthians it says "unto the church [or assembly] of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints," or saints by calling, and then it goes on to say, "with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours.<a name=144:11></a>" We are now dealing with the assembly locally.<a name=144:12></a> I do not think you can speak of the assembly of God in a place, even in
	</div>

		<a name=145>[Page 145]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		principle, if you have no saints there who are governed by the truth of the assembly.<a name=145:1></a> The mere fact that there may be saints in a place, and therefore abstractly belonging to the assembly, does not warrant, as far as I see, any mention of the assembly of God in that place if they are not in fact moving together as governed by the light of the assembly, for one great thought in the assembly of God in a place is that it can be taken account of as God's accredited vessel of testimony in that place.<a name=145:2></a> If you have two or three saints in a place moving together as governed by the light of the assembly, then without assuming to be the assembly, which no instructed Christians would do, you can speak of the assembly of God in the place in the principle of it.<a name=145:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the idea of the assembly of God is that of a dignified company with which the name of God is connected publicly.<a name=145:4></a> It stands in the place as a company or vessel with which God's name and testimony are identified.<a name=145:5></a> Now that is a great responsibility as well as a great privilege.<a name=145:6></a> The Lord Himself when here was the vessel of testimony, it was a testimony of grace, and He stood up in the synagogue of Nazareth where He had been brought up and said, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to preach glad tidings to the poor," and so on.<a name=145:7></a> He stood up publicly as the anointed vessel of testimony for God in that place where He had been brought up.<a name=145:8></a> Now Christ having gone on high and the Holy Spirit having come, the assembly takes His place as the anointed vessel for the expression of God in each locality, and so in 1 Corinthians the assembly is spoken of as the Christ.<a name=145:9></a> Paul says, "so also is the Christ," <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:12">1 Corinthians  12:12</a>.<a name=145:10></a> He is referring to the assembly.<a name=145:11></a> That conveys the idea of the assembly of God as an anointed vessel, composed of persons set together in a place, bearing the name of God and intended to maintain a testimony

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so in order that they may be equal to this position of being the assembly of God in Corinth they are spoken of also as "sanctified in Christ Jesus.<a name=146:8></a>" That links on with what we have been saying as to the cross and the Spirit.<a name=146:9></a> The cross is what the apostle brings forward in the first chapter to meet the unsatisfactory state of things at Corinth.<a name=146:10></a> He brings in the word of the cross, because every sort of evil was there, and the root of all that was there was that the man that God had ended in the cross had been revived at Corinth.<a name=146:11></a> That is the root of all the troubles amongst us, dear brethren.<a name=146:12></a> Whatever trouble arises amongst us, whatever its character, you can trace it to the fact, that the cross of Christ has not its place in our souls.<a name=146:13></a> If the cross of Christ in the power and import of it is maintained in our souls there will be no trouble amongst the saints.<a name=146:14></a> The saints are spoken of as sanctified in Christ Jesus; that is, they are set apart to God in Him.<a name=146:15></a> How else
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=147>[Page 147]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		could God commit His testimony to them?<a name=147:1></a> Anything committed to the first man is bound to fail, history proves that; so God does not commit His testimony now to the first man.<a name=147:2></a> He commits His testimony to an assembly of persons sanctified in Christ Jesus, those set apart to Him in the Man of His pleasure by the Holy Spirit.<a name=147:3></a> Such persons are saints by divine calling, so when the apostle is dealing in chapter 5 with the gross evil that had shown itself among the saints at Corinth, he says, "Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, according as ye are unleavened," not in order that ye may become unleavened.<a name=147:4></a> That is, he brings to bear upon them what they are in Christ, sanctified persons in Christ Jesus, in order that they may learn to judge and discard everything that is inconsistent with it.<a name=147:5></a> Hence, it is of great importance to us, dear brethren, first to appropriate for ourselves the cross of Christ, and to get the gain ourselves of the presence of the Spirit of God, and then to learn to view ourselves and our fellow saints according to what we are, sanctified in Christ Jesus, unleavened.<a name=147:6></a> That is what we are, and as such God is pleased to entrust His testimony to us, in the place where He has set us, and the power for the maintenance of the position is the Holy Spirit.<a name=147:7></a>

		Now when the tabernacle, God's dwelling place, was constructed, it was anointed in all its parts.<a name=147:8></a> Everything had to come under the anointing, the Spirit of God was to characterise everything that was done in God's dwelling place.<a name=147:9></a> So when we come together in assembly the Spirit of God should give character to everything.<a name=147:10></a> The Spirit of God imparts a certain dignity, a certain power, a certain intelligence.<a name=147:11></a> The Spirit of God imparts to those who are characterised by Him something that is entirely of God, and marked out as not being of man, and that is what God is looking for in the assembly.<a name=147:12></a> If you

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		look at <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#30">Exodus  30</a>, where you find the instructions for the making of the anointing oil, you will see that it had to be carefully compounded.<a name=148:1></a> That is, it can only be arrived at by a good deal of careful exercise.<a name=148:2></a> It was not only olive oil, but there were liquid myrrh and other spices in its composition.<a name=148:3></a> One might have intelligence in the Spirit and yet might be marked by a certain uncouthness in the way things were done, but the anointing oil involves a carefully balanced compound bringing in different features of the Spirit of God and of the Spirit of Christ, so that there is a certain dignity, and a certain grace, and a certain authority, and a certain intelligence, about all that is done.<a name=148:4></a> That is what God is looking for in His assembly, and I believe the more we think about it the more we will see that the anointing ought to enter into everything that is done in the assembly, including, for instance, the giving out of notices and the raising of tunes; everything that is done in the assembly publicly should bear the distinctive impress of the anointing, for the reason that God is publicly represented in it.<a name=148:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now to refer to Ephesians, I was saying a moment ago, that in the recognition of the cross of Christ and the power of the Holy Spirit we are able to take account of ourselves and of the saints according to divine thoughts, and it is a wonderful thing when we have believed in Christ and received the Holy Spirit to take account of the fact that that is the result of God having wrought in us.<a name=148:6></a> All is really of God.<a name=148:7></a> There has been the side of our responsibility to believe the glad tidings presented to us, and thank God we have done it, but having done it we have to recognise that all is of God, that all is the result of the work of God.<a name=148:8></a> The Lord makes that perfectly clear in the third chapter of John's gospel, that there must be new birth, an entirely new beginning, entirely of God.<a name=148:9></a> And God has thus operated, His love entering

		I desire the help of the Lord, dear brethren, to say a little as to our most holy faith.<a name=151:1></a> Jude enjoins upon us to build ourselves up on our most holy faith.<a name=151:2></a> Surely this was in view of apostate conditions, which in his day were manifesting themselves in the world, and which in our day are almost full-blown, for this country and other countries which have been blessed with the truth of Christianity, are rapidly giving it up, and these are things, dear brethren, to which we cannot shut our eyes.<a name=151:3></a> It is in the presence of these conditions, that Jude urges the necessity for us to be building ourselves up on our most holy faith, and to be praying in the Holy Spirit, and thus to keep ourselves in the love of God.<a name=151:4></a> If we are kept in the love of God Christianity is a reality to us, and to be in the enjoyment of Christianity, what is involved in the knowledge of God, and of Christ, and of our portion among the brethren, is the surest preservative against being carried away by the tide of apostasy.<a name=151:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Jude speaks of himself as a bondman of Jesus Christ, and I believe the thought of bondman, whether it be of God or of Jesus Christ, is a most important one for us to take up.<a name=151:6></a> If you care to look it up, you will find that all the writers of epistles in the New Testament call themselves bondmen either of God or of Jesus Christ; Paul in Romans, Philippians, and Titus; Peter in his second epistle; James in his epistle; John in the book of Revelation, and also Jude, as we have said, have all taken up the position that they regard themselves as bondmen of God or of Jesus Christ, and that is not something to be merely taken up by those who are gifted.<a name=151:7></a> The

	<div class="page-number">

	<div class="paragraph">
		epistle to the Romans would show us, that as the gospel of the grace of God is rightly apprehended in our souls, it results in each one of us holding himself, first as a bondman to righteousness, and finally as a bondman to God.<a name=152:1></a> That is of great importance, because it works out practically in our salvation from lawlessness.<a name=152:2></a> To be a bondman of God means that we recognise that we belong to Him in an absolute way, and that is what is to govern us.<a name=152:3></a> Not that there is anything servile about bondmanship, nor that there is anything degraded about it; far from it, for it has been made most glorious in a moral sense by the fact that He who was in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made Himself of no reputation, and took upon Him a bondman's form.<a name=152:4></a> So that bondmanship to God has been exalted gloriously in a moral sense, as being set out perfectly in Christ; and I need not say that after the Lord Jesus came and set out that idea of bondmanship to God, glorifying God in it, it was with the intention of wielding the mighty influence which He holds over the hearts of His people to secure a corresponding result with everyone of us.<a name=152:5></a> So that practically, in a world of evil, we may be delivered from lawlessness, as holding ourselves here under the claims of divine love in redemption and under the influence of Christ, to be for God's will.<a name=152:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in the book of Revelation the thought of bondmen is greatly stressed, and I believe the idea of bondmen in that book is that if we hold ourselves as bondmen to God, we shall be preserved from every influence that would divert us in the testimony.<a name=152:7></a> That is, that whatever situation or test may arise, the question is, do we regard ourselves as bondmen of God?<a name=152:8></a> In Romans it is, I believe, to save us from the lawlessness that might tend to mark us ourselves, but in Revelation, I believe, it has in mind, while, of course, including the other thought, that we
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=153>[Page 153]</a>

		should take our place definitely in the testimony as belonging to God and be here for His rights and His testimony; though it may mean suffering, we shall have divine protection, divine recognition, and the support of the Lord.<a name=153:1></a> So Jude writes as a bondman.<a name=153:2></a> He had intended to write as to the common salvation, but felt compelled to turn aside from his original purpose because of the apostasy which was already showing itself, to urge upon the saints to contend earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints.<a name=153:3></a> The best way to contend for the faith is to be in it in power and enjoyment, so Jude urges upon us to build ourselves up on our most holy faith.<a name=153:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I think perhaps the scriptures we have read in Exodus and Leviticus -- not that one can touch on them in any detail -- might serve to give some definite impression of certain features of our most holy faith.<a name=153:5></a> <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#29">Exodus  29</a>gives us the term <i>most holy</i> connected with the altar.<a name=153:6></a> It says, "seven days shalt thou make atonement for the altar and hallow it; and the altar shall be most holy: whatever toucheth the altar shall be holy.<a name=153:7></a>" The altar speaks of our means of approach to God, and that, I need not say, is Christ.<a name=153:8></a> In Christianity we have continual access to God through Christ by the Holy Spirit, and God would have us recognise that there is no other means of approach.<a name=153:9></a> It must always be by Christ, and that of itself is sobering and sanctifying, for there is no taint of unholiness in Christ.<a name=153:10></a> As down here, the Holy One of God, He was conscious of it Himself.<a name=153:11></a> He said prophetically, as facing death, "Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.<a name=153:12></a>" The thought of the altar involves much, for none but Christ was equal to sustaining all that was placed upon the altar.<a name=153:13></a> If there was to be a presentation to God in the sacrifice of Christ of that which would glorify God in regard of sin, it needed that He should come

		forth in the greatness of His person, for no one else was able to sustain it, and I believe the altar would thus speak to us of the greatness of Christ.<a name=154:1></a> It is taken account of separately from that which is offered on it, see <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#23:19">Matthew  23:19</a>.<a name=154:2></a> It was essential that <i>He</i> should come in, in order that by means of death there should be established a point of continual contact between God's people and Himself.<a name=154:3></a> The principal thought of the altar is not in connection with sin, but rather in connection with the burnt offering, and it says, "This is what thou shalt offer upon the altar; two lambs of the first year, day by day continually.<a name=154:4></a> The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer between the two evenings.<a name=154:5></a>" That is very touching, dear brethren, because it suggests to us how God delights in our drawing near to Him and having to do with Him every morning and every evening.<a name=154:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#28">Numbers  28</a>we find that God lays down what He requires.<a name=154:7></a> It is what God looks for, not simply for our own good, but that He has something for His own satisfaction in that which His people present to Him; so there is in connection with the altar, and it is most holy, this suggestion of the morning lamb and the evening lamb.<a name=154:8></a> That is, God would have us draw near to Him by means of the altar, but in the value of that which has been offered upon the altar, in the continual sense of the offering of Christ, that He has devoted Himself according to God's will to bringing in that which was wholly pleasing to Him.<a name=154:9></a> In another aspect of His death He removes all that was displeasing to Him, but in the burnt offering He establishes what is abidingly pleasing to God.<a name=154:10></a> We have to do with God in the abiding value and acceptance of what the burnt offering means to God.<a name=154:11></a> And so it was to be offered in the morning and "with the one lamb a tenth part of wheaten flour

		mingled with beaten oil, a fourth part of a hin, and a drink offering, a fourth part of a hin of wine.<a name=155:1></a>" And so every approach on our part to God in the value of what Christ is, and has been, as the burnt-offering, will normally be accompanied by some ability to present to God our appreciation of what Jesus was as a Man here wholly delightful to God.<a name=155:2></a> If He was delightful in death, He was delightful to God in life, and that is what is suggested in the flour.<a name=155:3></a> Then there is the drink-offering too, suggestive, I believe, of Jesus having gone the whole length in self-abnegation to God, whatever it cost; the pouring out of the drink-offering suggests going the whole length, and in doing so affording holy stimulation to the heart of God.<a name=155:4></a> I believe it is to find an answer in us, for Paul contemplates in writing to the Philippians that he would willingly be poured out as a libation on the sacrifice and ministration of their faith.<a name=155:5></a> The Philippians had brought a gift to Paul at considerable cost to themselves, for they were poor, and Epaphroditus had nearly lost his life in bringing it, and he was so delighted in that free giving in them as the fruit of his labours, that he said if necessary he was prepared to go to the utmost length in subjection to God's will, even to martyrdom, that they might be all the more stimulated to follow on similar lines.<a name=155:6></a> He therefore contemplated that he might be poured out as a libation in order to give completion to that which was so pleasing to God in them.<a name=155:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As I have said, the first impression that we get of the libation is in Christ, and every day, every morning, we must have to do with God by means of the altar, as identified with the burnt-offering offered on the altar.<a name=155:8></a> God does not contemplate, when it comes to the evening, that we should be any less in the sense of acceptance in our appreciation of Christ and of the pleasure God has in Him.<a name=155:9></a> He does not contemplate we should be any less in the appreciation of

		that in the evening than the morning.<a name=156:1></a> It abides unchangingly before God and the Spirit of God would remind us of it.<a name=156:2></a> If we think rightly of the altar we embrace it at least twice a day; indeed it really gives character to the whole day, the evening being equal to the morning.<a name=156:3></a> That is, God's heart should be refreshed by the saints drawing near to Him in the liberty which the appreciation of Christ and His precious death involves.<a name=156:4></a> So we can understand that the altar is spoken of as most holy.<a name=156:5></a> This is a very simple matter, but a most precious one, and it is one of the items of our most holy faith in which we are to build ourselves up.<a name=156:6></a> The more we embrace this the more we shall be accustomed to having to do with God, and enabled to stand against the tide of apostasy which is shortly to sweep over the so-called Christian world.<a name=156:7></a> And so in verse 45, God says, "I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel, and will be their God.<a name=156:8></a> And they shall know that I am Jehovah their God, who have brought them forth out of the land of Egypt to dwell in their midst: I am Jehovah their God.<a name=156:9></a>" As we avail ourselves of the altar and of our privilege of drawing near to God, we shall become established in the knowledge of God, for He delights to dwell among His people and be their God.<a name=156:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Leviticus we come to further matters that are spoken of as most holy, and in chapter 6, verse 14, the expression is connected with the meat offering or oblation, and what is brought into prominence is not only the offering of the oblation to Jehovah, but also the eating of it on the part of the priests.<a name=156:11></a> There is the offering of it to Jehovah, so that God might have His portion in what the oblation speaks of, but also it is contemplated that the priests themselves should eat of it.<a name=156:12></a> Now, if one may speak for others, I believe this is a matter in which most of us will feel we are defective, for we live in days that are

		marked by much activity and rapidity and distraction of one kind and another, and Satan would make use of all these things to hinder us from taking time to feed our souls with things that are most holy.<a name=157:1></a> It is essential that we should learn how to feed on the food provided for the saints.<a name=157:2></a> Feeding, as far as I understand it, means dwelling with our minds on certain things presented to us objectively, so that the affections become fed, and it is specially important in relation to every presentation of Christ as the oblation.<a name=157:3></a> He was, as a Man down here, wholly according to God, and entirely different from the order of man that brought such displeasure to the heart of God.<a name=157:4></a> We can well understand God opening the heavens and saying, "Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight.<a name=157:5></a>" I would venture to suggest that we might well make it a matter of personal exercise and desire expressed to God, that He would open our eyes more and more to what it was that He found so delightful in Jesus.<a name=157:6></a> I mean that we should have ability to take account of the detailed perfections of Jesus as they appeared under God's eye.<a name=157:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How much it meant to God to have One who was His equal, down here in flesh and blood, moving in the power of the Holy Spirit, all His movements perfect, ever considering for God, never a single movement for Himself, ever glorifying God.<a name=157:8></a> How little one is able to speak of it, and yet there is that which was under God's eye as perfect, whether it was in the thirty years before he came out in public testimony or in the three and a half years of testimony.<a name=157:9></a> All was perfect.<a name=157:10></a> In the second chapter of Leviticus we get various details as to different ways in which the oblation might be presented.<a name=157:11></a> So we find fine flour mingled with oil and then fine flour anointed with oil; the one referring to the essentially holy character of the manhood of the Lord Jesus, apart altogether

		from what He was in testimony here, and the other referring to what He was here in testimony in the power of the anointing.<a name=158:1></a> These suggestions all speak of the way in which the perfections of Jesus were brought to light under the eye of God.<a name=158:2></a> So we are given ability, in reading the gospels, not only to see the import of what is written and its bearing upon the assembly, but also to see how the gospel writers by the Holy Spirit present to our eyes and hearts what Jesus was under God's eye.<a name=158:3></a> As priests we are to feed upon it, in order that we may become more like Him, so that our approach to God may be such as will afford Him pleasure.<a name=158:4></a> It says in verse 17, "It shall not be baken with leaven; as their portion have I given it unto them of my offerings by fire; it is most holy; as the sin-offering, and as the trespass offering.<a name=158:5></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that leads us to the sin offering and the trespass-offering, as to which I read a few verses at the end of chapter 6 and the beginning of chapter 7.<a name=158:6></a> It is remarkable that in the book of Leviticus, in which so much, in the earlier part of it, deals with our ministering to the pleasure of God by drawing near to Him with offerings of various kinds, the sin offering and the trespass-offering come last.<a name=158:7></a> The burnt offering comes first, and then the meat offering or oblation, and then the peace offering and finally the sin offering and trespass offering.<a name=158:8></a> I suppose the trespass offering has reference to the infringement of the rights of God, and the sin offering has reference to what sins are as an affront to God's holy nature.<a name=158:9></a> There is His nature which is outraged by every sin, and there are also His rights which are challenged by every sin, so the returning prodigal in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15">Luke  15</a>says, "I have sinned against heaven and before thee; I am no longer worthy to be called thy son.<a name=158:10></a>" Heaven is God's throne, and is a question of the rights of God, and every sin is a sin against heaven;

		<a name=159>[Page 159]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that is, it is a challenge to the rights of God, for it is the assertion of the will of the creature in opposition to the will of the Creator.<a name=159:1></a> Every sin therefore is serious from that standpoint, it is rebellion against the rights of God, but then God being love, every sin is offensive to His nature.<a name=159:2></a> The returning prodigal says, "I have sinned .<a name=159:3></a>.<a name=159:4></a>.<a name=159:5></a> before thee.<a name=159:6></a>" Think of the enormity of sinning against such a God!<a name=159:7></a> Sin is thus to be taken account of by us in no superficial way, but as involving this double aspect of seriousness.<a name=159:8></a> I believe the sin offering and the trespass offering view the matter from these two standpoints, but in each case it is spoken of as most holy.<a name=159:9></a> We need not enlarge upon it, dear brethren, in fact one has but little ability to speak of it, but how important it is, that we, as priests, should know what it is to eat the sin offering and also the trespass offering.<a name=159:10></a> It says, every male among the priests was to eat thereof and also in verse 26, "the priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it; in a holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tent of meeting.<a name=159:11></a>" So it is contemplated that as priests we should feed upon the trespass offering and the sin offering.<a name=159:12></a> That is, that every failure on my part not only requires that I should confess it before God and be restored to communion in the abiding value of the blood of Christ, but that one should deepen in the appreciation of what it cost the Lord Jesus, and what it cost God, to put that sin away, and not only so, but we should deepen in the appreciation of the Holy One who alone could put it away by means of His own sacrifice.<a name=159:13></a> So the practical exercise connected with this is intended that there should be brought into activity what is priestly in myself.<a name=159:14></a> As having the Holy Spirit I am capable of what is priestly, and what is priestly should come into operation as I feed on what has been offered.<a name=159:15></a> And this works out in priestliness in regard of the failures of others, for if

		I have only touched on these things very briefly, but I am sure that you will appreciate that these are items of a most important character.<a name=160:2></a> All these exercises as passing through a world full of evil, are intended to develop in us the means whereby we build ourselves up on our most holy faith, and are kept in the sense of the love of God.<a name=160:3></a> There is nothing so precious to us as the love of God.<a name=160:4></a> God has given us the Holy Spirit not only to shed the love of God abroad in our hearts, but that we may avail ourselves of it and thus become expanded and formed by the reality of divine love known in our souls.<a name=160:5></a> As we do these things we shall present in the world that which will restrain the full development of evil.<a name=160:6></a> The mystery of lawlessness is already working, but there is He who restrains and that which restrains, and that includes the work of God in the souls of His people.<a name=160:7></a> They are able to bring in positively that which is pleasing to God, and thus to raise a banner against the developing evil, which will not develop completely until after the assembly is taken.<a name=160:8></a>

		Well now in closing, I want to refer briefly to what we have in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>, for while we do not get the expression <i>most holy</i> in that chapter, I think everyone will recognise that it presents to us things that are most holy.<a name=160:9></a> I had in mind especially the Father's name, for the Lord refers to it in the chapter as a means by which the disciples were kept while He was with them, and the means by which they were to be kept after He was taken from them, and in speaking to His Father in relation to it He says, <i>Holy Father</i>.<a name=160:10></a> It is very touching to hear the Lord addressing His Father in this way, <i>Holy Father</i>, as standing in contrast to the world of evil in which His own were to be left in His absence.<a name=160:11></a> He says,

		"Holy Father, keep them in thy name which thou has given me, that they may be one as we.<a name=161:1></a>" It is very touching that the Lord presents Himself as a Man here, moving in the good of what the Father was to Him, all that the name of the Father meant to Him.<a name=161:2></a> So in a previous chapter He says to the disciples, "If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.<a name=161:3></a>" A most touching thing that the Lord presents Himself as having remained in the joy of His Father's love as having kept His Father's commandments.<a name=161:4></a> So He presents things in a way that we can take up.<a name=161:5></a> In John's epistle, the Father is presented to us as in contrast with the world.<a name=161:6></a> The young men are exhorted by John not to love the world, nor the things that are in the world, then he speaks of the things that are in the world as being the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes and the pride of life.<a name=161:7></a> Now it is possible to be apart from the world outwardly, and yet to be governed largely by the things of the world, but John says if anyone love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.<a name=161:8></a> The Lord prays that the Father would keep them in His name, not that He should take them out of the world, but that He should keep them out of evil, and He adds, "As thou hast sent me into the world, I also have sent them into the world.<a name=161:9></a>" If we may, as I believe we may, take this up humbly in the principle of it as applying to ourselves, that we are sent into the world in order to be here in the testimony.<a name=161:10></a> What a dignified position it places us in!<a name=161:11></a> And He says further, "I sanctify myself for them, that they also may be sanctified by truth.<a name=161:12></a>" I understand that to mean that the Lord set Himself apart from this world by going to the Father, in order that we may learn in Him the place we have in the Father's love.<a name=161:13></a> There is nothing so sanctifying as the sense of the Father's love resting

		I have in mind, dear brethren, to speak of the personal influence of Christ upon five individuals: upon the man who had a legion of demons, upon Mary of Bethany, upon Peter, upon John, and upon Paul.<a name=163:1></a> The influence of Christ shows itself in the first case in subjection and sobriety, in Mary in intelligence, in Peter in serving love, Peter taking it on and enjoining it on others, in John in restful love, and in Paul in purpose of heart to acquire and take on heavenly excellence, that which is most excellent.<a name=163:2></a> I believe all these things should be found in the assembly, but there cannot be anything found in the assembly that is not found in the individuals who compose it, and hence the need that each of us should be concerned as to how far we keep ourselves under the influence of Christ.<a name=163:3></a> There is no greater power in the universe than the influence of Christ.<a name=163:4></a> It is a great thing, dear brethren, to understand it; it is a most transforming influence that exceeds and ever will exceed all others, the influence of Christ.<a name=163:5></a> His influence over millions is tremendous, and eternal in its results, and I believe God effects what He is working out in the saints now, by way of the personal influence of Christ brought to bear upon them by the Holy Spirit.<a name=163:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the man in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#8">Luke  8</a>presents the effect of that influence on a man who was in a complete sense under the power and influence of evil.<a name=163:7></a> He was possessed by a legion of demons.<a name=163:8></a> He thus represents an extreme case, a case that is not intended, so to speak, to be representative of us all, for one would not dare to say that anyone here was under the influence of a

		demon, far less of a legion of them, but at the same time, he presents an extreme case of a man under the influence of evil, in order to show that, what the Lord can do in an extreme case.<a name=164:1></a> He can do in every other case that is less extreme, and every one of us has to recognise that in some degree at least, each one is under the influence of evil until he or she is brought to do with the Lord.<a name=164:2></a> But then what comes to light is that not only was the power of evil in that man completely dispossessed, but that he came in an effective and transforming way under the personal influence of Christ, and that is what God intends for every one of us, that we should be brought abidingly under the influence of Christ.<a name=164:3></a> It says that they went out and saw the man out of whom the demons had been cast sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and sensible.<a name=164:4></a> The idea of sensible here is not so much the idea of intelligence as rather that he was sober, having a sober estimate of himself.<a name=164:5></a> Each one of us needs that, dear brethren, for naturally each one of us likes his own will and in some degree or other has high thoughts of himself.<a name=164:6></a> With some it may be more pronounced than with others, with some it may be more secret than with others, but I think everyone here will acknowledge that it is natural to us, until we are brought into touch with Christ, to like our own will and to have high thoughts of ourselves.<a name=164:7></a> Now, the effect of the grace of God reaching us in Christ is to deliver us from all that.<a name=164:8></a> I think one of the earliest results of grace being rightly apprehended is that we are delivered from every element of self-will.<a name=164:9></a> We present our bodies, as it says in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12">Romans  12</a>, "a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your intelligent service.<a name=164:10></a>" The Lord came in, that that might be secured in every one of His own.<a name=164:11></a> He came in, as it says figuratively in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#21">Exodus  21</a>, with His body: I am referring to the Hebrew bondman.<a name=164:12></a> The Lord would thus, as having

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a wonderful thing to think how transforming the influence of Christ is; there is nothing so affecting as His personal influence.<a name=165:3></a> And as we begin to take account of what Paul says in relation to the Lord Jesus, "Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant," it is likely to have a subduing and transforming effect upon us.<a name=165:4></a> There is a certain moral excellence, dear brethren, in being here for the will of God, as well as its being our intelligent service, the only right answer to the grace that has reached us.<a name=165:5></a> So this man was sitting at the feet of Jesus; he was delivered from the power of evil and in subjection to Christ.<a name=165:6></a> But then, as a result of coming under the influence of Christ we become sober.<a name=165:7></a> We do not begin to have high thoughts about ourselves, the cross of Christ has its right place in our hearts, and we begin to take account of things in the light of that.<a name=165:8></a> We say to ourselves that our old man has been crucified with Him.<a name=165:9></a> That is the effect in our hearts of contemplating the cross of Christ, so that high thoughts are written off.<a name=165:10></a> There is not only the cross of Christ, but there is the mind which was in Christ Jesus, of which we have been speaking.<a name=165:11></a> If one begins to have thoughts of obtaining a reputation for himself, the Spirit of God reminds one of Him who made Himself of <i>no</i> reputation, and God has highly exalted Him.<a name=165:12></a> God has given Him all the reputation, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow.<a name=165:13></a> It is these things presented to our hearts in Christ personally that have a definitely formative, subduing effect upon us.<a name=165:14></a> We have sober thoughts, not having high thoughts of ourselves, as

		it says in Romans "as God has dealt to each a measure of faith.<a name=166:1></a>" We are not to think nothing of ourselves, because we recognise that God is working in us and when God begins to work we are not worth nothing!<a name=166:2></a> We are intended to work into the divine plan, but we have sober thoughts of ourselves according as God has dealt to each a measure of faith.<a name=166:3></a> Now that, I believe, is what is illustrated in the man who was possessed with a legion of demons; they found him sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind.<a name=166:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now with Mary of Bethany what is seen in her is that characteristically she sat at Jesus' feet and listened to His word.<a name=166:5></a> The Lord says of her that "Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.<a name=166:6></a>" It is very important, beloved brethren, that we cultivate the habit of listening to the word of Christ, because I do not know any way in which we shall become intelligent spiritually save as listening to the word of Christ.<a name=166:7></a> All divine wisdom is in Christ, all fulness is in Him, and the assembly is to derive from Him.<a name=166:8></a> Mary had grasped the idea; that is, in its application to us, it is not only that we read the Scriptures and the ministry and attend the meetings, but is it our exercise that the Lord will speak to us in it, that in it we will hear the Lord's voice, and are we cultivating sober thoughts, so that there is an opportunity for the Lord to speak to us.<a name=166:9></a> That is what is so important.<a name=166:10></a> The Lord Himself, as having come in as Man to serve God, moved on the principle that His ear was opened morning by morning to hear as the instructed.<a name=166:11></a> <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10">Luke  10</a>provides us with certain features which are to be found marking each local company.<a name=166:12></a> The chapter begins with the Lord sending out seventy to every city and place where He Himself was about to come.<a name=166:13></a> That is, cities and places were in mind, and the Lord was intending that the ministry of the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=167>[Page 167]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		seventy would come under His review as to its effects when He Himself would come to the place to see what results there were.<a name=167:1></a> The chapter gives various characteristics that are to be found in local companies, it is stated, for instance, that there is to be the rejoicing that our names are written in heaven.<a name=167:2></a> That is we are to rejoice in our heavenly portion, so distinctive, and to praise the Father accordingly, then the spirit of care is to be there.<a name=167:3></a> The Good Samaritan took up the man whom He found and brought him to the inn, and took care of him, and then in leaving indicated that any amount of care may be expended upon the saints and the Lord will see that those who do so are repaid.<a name=167:4></a> And then there is also the incident as to Mary, which shows that spiritual intelligence is also to be a feature of each local company, sitting at Jesus' feet and listening to His word, and no one is to deprive us of that.<a name=167:5></a> Martha was cumbered with much serving.<a name=167:6></a> It is a right thing to desire to serve the Lord and we are to be active in it, always abounding in the work of the Lord, which applies to us all, it does not only apply to gift, but is addressed to the brethren, but at the same time as abounding in service we are also to preserve a balance, and to see that our activities of service do not deprive us of sitting at the feet of Jesus and listening to His word.<a name=167:7></a> Only in that way can the intelligence that God looks for in the assembly, be learned.<a name=167:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Peter in his epistle shows, I think, how much he had been affected by the way Christ has served.<a name=167:9></a> It is worthy of note that Peter as an elder enjoins on his fellow elders, and says, "the elders which are among you, I exhort, who am their fellow elder and witness of the sufferings of the Christ, who also am partaker of the glory about to be revealed shepherd the flock of God which is among you.<a name=167:10></a>" He is speaking as a man of experience.<a name=167:11></a> He is not
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=168>[Page 168]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		speaking as an apostle, though he might well have done so, and he does indeed call himself apostle of Jesus Christ in opening his epistle, but he is speaking as an elder, one who had had years of experience, and I suppose there was no one who had had more experience of the shepherd service of Christ than Peter.<a name=168:1></a> He would no doubt carry a sense of it in his soul.<a name=168:2></a> It is he who speaks of the Shepherd and Overseer of our souls.<a name=168:3></a> We well know how the Lord Jesus shepherded Peter.<a name=168:4></a> There came a time in the history of the disciples when the Lord said to them, "Will ye also go away," and Peter said, "Lord, to whom shall we go, thou hast words of life eternal"?<a name=168:5></a> As though he would say, 'I know where the food supply is.<a name=168:6></a>' He knew how his own soul had been fed, he was not going to be turned away from the Shepherd.<a name=168:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So one of the first things in shepherding is to see that suitable food is provided, and also to see that there is encouragement.<a name=168:8></a> How the Lord would encourage Peter!<a name=168:9></a> When Peter came forward as he did on one occasion with his confession, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the Living God," the Lord immediately speaks to him and says, "Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona, for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.<a name=168:10></a>" The Lord encouraged Peter, and there is nothing so encouraging as to bring home to the saints something of the thoughts of divine grace which they have part in.<a name=168:11></a> So the Lord would, so to speak, say to Peter, 'You are blessed indeed, Simon Barjona.<a name=168:12></a>' He called him by the name by which he was known amongst men, but implies, 'You have something in your heart that the Father has implanted there; you have something that your neighbour has not, it is a sovereign act of God.<a name=168:13></a>' So God has given us an appreciation of Christ.<a name=168:14></a> In no other way can it be explained, but that it is God's sovereign act in opening

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		our eyes to Christ, so we may well encourage one another that we have been thus blessed.<a name=169:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the Lord went on to say, "Thou art Peter," and the Lord would say to every one of us, that if God has wrought in us sovereignly, we are to have part in that system, in that response in the assembly, which God is securing at the present time.<a name=169:2></a> So everyone who has a right apprehension of Christ and of the saints may be encouraged on these lines.<a name=169:3></a> But then Peter also knew how to be rebuked, for the Lord said to him on one occasion, "Get thee behind me, Satan.<a name=169:4></a>" A most solemn rebuke!<a name=169:5></a> as though to remind us that if we allow our minds to work, we shall expose ourselves to the influence of Satan.<a name=169:6></a> Peter knew what the care of the Lord Jesus was for his soul.<a name=169:7></a> As the Lord was in the presence of His persecutors, as they were reviling Him and spitting upon Him, the Lord turned and looked at Peter when he had just denied the Lord for the third time.<a name=169:8></a> You can understand how Peter would be affected by the look of Jesus; there was the Lord in the midst of His sufferings at the hands of men, and in the midst of all that, there was no self-consideration on the part of the Lord, but He turned and looked on Peter; the shepherd care of Christ was showing itself in serving Peter.<a name=169:9></a> And then when the Lord arose from the dead, how He went after Peter!<a name=169:10></a> When Mary of Magdala, and Mary the mother of James and Salome came to the tomb on the first day of the week a young man said to them, "Go tell his disciples <i>and Peter</i>, he goes before you into Galilee," <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#16:7">Mark  16:7</a>.<a name=169:11></a> Then when the Lord Himself had appeared to the two going to Emmaus, they returned to the disciples who were saying, "The Lord is indeed risen and has appeared to Simon.<a name=169:12></a>" I say that in order to convey an impression of the way Peter was affected by the personal influence of Christ, so that he as an elder enjoins on his fellow elders, as one who has himself
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=170>[Page 170]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		been shepherded, to shepherd the flock of God which is among them.<a name=170:1></a> Thus there is to be no element whatever of self-consideration or self-seeking in it; it is a question of the flock of God, and caring for the sheep in the flock of God requires a spirit of serving love.<a name=170:2></a> Peter had taken on shepherd features, and enjoins on the elders to "shepherd the flock of God, exercising oversight not by necessity but willingly; not for base gain, but readily; not as lording it over their possessions; but as being models for the flock.<a name=170:3></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is a most important matter, beloved brethren, for those of us who are getting to be a little older, the older brothers and the older sisters should see the great importance of exemplification.<a name=170:4></a> It is one of the most important things in Christianity, the importance of the truth being set out by means of exemplification and the elder ones are responsible to take it on.<a name=170:5></a> The younger ones may take it on too, but the elders are especially enjoined to be models for the flock.<a name=170:6></a> It is a principle that always holds good.<a name=170:7></a> You will remember how Paul dealt with the conditions that existed at Corinth, how in his epistle he brought authority to bear upon them, but authority as from a distance; that is, he would not come in amongst them, he knew that if he came in amongst them, he would have to deal drastically with the conditions that existed, so he remained away, but in order to enforce the authority in a moral way he sent amongst them Timothy, his beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who, he said, "shall put you in mind of my ways as they are in Christ, according as I teach everywhere in every assembly.<a name=170:8></a>" Thus Timothy as moving about, would remind them of Paul's ways, so that there would be seen the power of exemplification, which the Spirit of God always supports.<a name=170:9></a> This is illustrated, I believe, in the history of Gideon, for the history of Gideon answers to the history of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=171>[Page 171]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the Corinthians.<a name=171:1></a> It is a question of which man is going to have place amongst God's people, and the wrong man was there in Gideon's time.<a name=171:2></a> That is, Midian was there with the two kings and the two princes, and it says Israel was greatly impoverished because of Midian.<a name=171:3></a> They left no sustenance in Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass, and by what means were they to be delivered?<a name=171:4></a> By the sword of the Lord and of Gideon.<a name=171:5></a> The sword of the Lord is the authority of the word of the Lord.<a name=171:6></a> It is like the apostle bringing in the Lord's commandment in his epistle, but the sword of Gideon is the power of exemplification, because Gideon said "look on me, and do likewise.<a name=171:7></a>" These two things are always necessary in any local company to meet conditions that are contrary to the truth.<a name=171:8></a> On the one hand the authority of God's word, but on the other hand the power of exemplification of the truth.<a name=171:9></a> So Peter is affected by the serving love of Christ, and he enjoins on the elders to shepherd the flock of God, as being models for the flock.<a name=171:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When we come to John, it is the influence of Christ in restful love, because there is such a thing as serving love and there is such a thing as restful love, and both are to be characteristic of the assembly at this present time.<a name=171:11></a> It is like Abigail, who, as invited to become the wife of David, said, "Let thy handmaid be a bondwoman to wash the feet of the servants of my Lord.<a name=171:12></a>" That is, serving love, but in view of restfulness.<a name=171:13></a> Serving love is what is to characterise us here, but the assembly is also to learn restful love, and we are all to learn it, for God delights in it.<a name=171:14></a> He will rest in His love, He will joy over His people with singing, <a href="../bible/Zephaniah.htm#3:17">Zephaniah  3:17</a>.<a name=171:15></a> I believe John had learned restful love in Christ for he had companied with the Lord Jesus, as, of course, the other disciples had done, but John especially seems to have been affected by the moral glory that he apprehended in Christ.<a name=171:16></a> When I say the moral glory I do not mean
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=172>[Page 172]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the excellence of manhood in Jesus, but rather the glory of Christ as with His Father that John seems particularly to have been impressed with.<a name=172:1></a> He speaks of glory a great deal in his gospel.<a name=172:2></a> He says "we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father.<a name=172:3></a>" That is not according to man's ideas of glory, but it evidently greatly attracted John as he took account of Jesus, as an only-begotten with a father, and so he goes on to speak to us of "the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father.<a name=172:4></a>" A wonderful presentation of Christ, beloved brethren, for John wrote that by the Spirit of God many years after Christ had ascended, he wrote from that standpoint, the present position of Christ.<a name=172:5></a> That is, he presents the idea of settled conditions of love, the Father loving the Son, and the Son resting in the love in which He is as Man, and that, dear brethren, has come into view in Christ so that we might apprehend what our portion is as taken into favour in the Beloved.<a name=172:6></a> Not that anyone else but Christ is said to be in the bosom of the Father, but His position in its uniqueness is apprehensible by us.<a name=172:7></a> You remember in the first chapter of John's gospel, certain disciples followed Jesus and He turned and saw them following and said, "What seek ye?<a name=172:8></a>" and they said, "Rabbi, where abidest thou?<a name=172:9></a> and he says to them, Come and see.<a name=172:10></a> They went therefore, and saw where he abode, and they abode with him that day.<a name=172:11></a>" Thus they were introduced into the abode of the Son, and they abode with Him.<a name=172:12></a> Now I believe John had peculiarly apprehended that, and so in chapter 13 we have John in the bosom of Jesus; that is, he had apprehended, if I may say so, the bosom idea; the idea of restful love, the place where love can be restful.<a name=172:13></a> I am sure we need to cultivate restfulness.<a name=172:14></a> The first presentation of love in the Scriptures is the love of a father for a son, it is set forth in Abraham and Isaac.<a name=172:15></a> "Take now thy

		<a name=173>[Page 173]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		son, thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest.<a name=173:1></a>" That is, so to speak, the prime thought how Christ is to be apprehended in sonship as loved of the Father, and it goes into eternity.<a name=173:2></a> When we get a sense of the place the Son has in the affections of the Father and the place the assembly has in the affections of Christ, we understand what the Lord said, in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>, referring to this day, "in that day ye shall know that <i>I</i> am in my Father, and <i>ye</i> in me, and <i>I</i> in you.<a name=173:3></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the influence of Christ upon John was seen in the verses read from <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>.<a name=173:4></a> He was enjoying love in the bosom of Jesus, and in that position he was absolutely unmoved whatever arose.<a name=173:5></a> A serious issue is raised, the Lord says that one of the disciples should deliver Him up.<a name=173:6></a> Simon Peter made a sign to John to ask who it might be of whom He spoke.<a name=173:7></a> But John, leaning on the breast of Jesus says to Him, "Lord, who is it?<a name=173:8></a>" That is, it is not only a question of being restful in love, but you can rely on it, on the strength of it; and so John stresses one thing that will go through, the love of Christ.<a name=173:9></a> He says, "Jesus, knowing that his hour had come that he should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, loved them to the end.<a name=173:10></a>" The Lord was taking account of what the world would be in His absence, and He set Himself to love them right through to the end.<a name=173:11></a> It is most important, dear brethren, that we should have the sense of that and cultivate it too.<a name=173:12></a> There is one thing that will never fail, and that is the love of Christ, and it is a good thing to see to it that we strengthen ourselves in the knowledge of it.<a name=173:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, now finally in regard to Paul.<a name=173:14></a> The influence of Christ upon Paul was, of course, very great and varied.<a name=173:15></a> I do not suggest that what is seen in this third chapter of Philippians was the only result of the influence of Christ upon Paul for it certainly was not, but it is a striking thing that when we come to

	<div class="paragraph">
		the epistle to the Philippians we have Paul, who was, I suppose, the greatest of the apostles, and had more revealed to him than any other, and suffered more than any others, as he is drawing near the close of his history, marked by one desire to know Christ, and to apprehend that for which he had been apprehended by Christ Jesus.<a name=174:1></a> He speaks of "the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord" and speaks in the first chapter of our approving the things that are more excellent; it is a superlative expression, because literally there cannot be anything better than what is excellent.<a name=174:2></a> He commenced his career as a believer with the light of the glory of Christ, a light above the brightness of the sun.<a name=174:3></a> As far as we know he did not know Christ in the days of His flesh, and even if he did he says in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5">2 Corinthians  5</a>, "yet now we know him thus no longer.<a name=174:4></a>" Certainly his history as a believer dated and took character from the light he received of Christ in glory.<a name=174:5></a> We have never seen Christ; but Paul had seen Him, and he apprehended in Christ in glory, the full thought that God has in mind for those whom He has taken up in Christ.<a name=174:6></a>

		May our hearts live for it, as we begin to get some sense of it.<a name=174:7></a> What it will be to be for ever free from the hindrance of the flesh, and the limitations of the earthen vessel, with no longer any trace of the conditions in which we are at the present time, but to be found in Christ, wholly suitable to the pleasure of God.<a name=174:8></a> We can appreciate it objectively in Jesus, but to think that we are to be like Him, even extending to our bodies.<a name=174:9></a> Christ's body of glory!<a name=174:10></a> The apostle is speaking of it as though his heart is filled with what he apprehended in Christ, and he says, "but one thing, forgetting the things behind, and stretching out to the things before, I pursue, looking towards the goal, for the prize of the calling on high of God in Christ Jesus.<a name=174:11></a>" The prize is nothing else than to

		THE FATHER, THE SON AND THE SPIRIT, IN RELATION TO THE SAINTS

		I have read these scriptures, dear brethren, in order to speak of the Father, and the Son, and the Spirit, in relation first of all to the individual believer, and then in relation to the saints as moving together in the light of the assembly and forming part of it.<a name=176:1></a> It is a touching thing that the Persons of the Godhead should come so near to us as they have done.<a name=176:2></a> We are intended in that way to know God fully as He is revealed, and each individual believer is intended to know the Father as revealed in the Son by the Holy Spirit, and to be conscious too of the service of the Holy Spirit to him, and the operations of the Holy Spirit in him.<a name=176:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We speak much in these days of the assembly and rightly so, and we should cherish it above everything, but it is well to bear in mind that the assembly is composed of individuals, and that we shall not get any greater measure of spiritual affections and intelligence in the assembly than is in the individuals who compose it, and therefore each individual brother or sister should be concerned as to his own part livingly in the things of God.<a name=176:4></a> You remember that Andrew and another followed Jesus; they had been disciples of John the baptist, but they heard him speaking, and followed Jesus.<a name=176:5></a> "But Jesus having turned, and seeing them following, says to them, What seek ye?<a name=176:6></a> And they said to him .<a name=176:7></a>.<a name=176:8></a>.<a name=176:9></a> where abidest thou?<a name=176:10></a> He says to them, Come and see," <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:38">John  1:38</a>, 39.<a name=176:11></a> That is very interesting as showing how the Lord takes notice of every individual movement toward Himself, and would certainly encourage it.<a name=176:12></a> He turned and saw them following and asked what they were seeking.<a name=176:13></a> He would have it come from them

		as to what they were seeking; He would have things definite in our minds as to what we desire, and would encourage every exercise, take notice of it, and indeed add to it, go beyond what we might be asking at the moment.<a name=177:1></a> Andrew, having proved the grace of the Lord Jesus, went and sought his brother Simon, and brought him to Jesus, and "Jesus looking at him said, <i>Thou</i> art Simon, the son of Jonas; thou shalt be called Cephas (which interpreted is stone.<a name=177:2></a>)" That is what the Lord would do to every young brother or sister as first having to do with the Lord.<a name=177:3></a> He would give you a sense that you are to be called Cephas, that is, that He has taken you up that you might be an integral part of the spiritual house, composed, not of material stones, but of living stones.<a name=177:4></a> God is pleased to dwell and be served, in a house composed of persons, persons capable of affections, capable of intelligence, and persons who are to be moved in their affections so as to serve God, not formally, not according to a man-made system, but to serve God spontaneously from the heart, and that is what Cephas conveys.<a name=177:5></a> Simon was to be called Cephas.<a name=177:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		According to another gospel the Lord said to Simon, "Thou art Peter," which is another thing, meaning that every believer having the Holy Spirit <i>is</i> a stone, but it is not sufficient to be a stone, we must be <i>called</i> a stone; that is, we are one characteristically.<a name=177:7></a> While a stone is an integral part of the spiritual house, it is also a living element in it and contributes its own part, and that is what the Lord wants in regard to every brother and sister, that not only are you to understand, that if you have received the Holy Spirit you are constituted a stone, but that you have the capabilities to function, and He wants you to function so that people will call you a stone.<a name=177:8></a> In young people it is sometimes difficult to find much in them of that kind of thing; that is,

		<a name=178>[Page 178]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		of the idea of Cephas.<a name=178:1></a> The Lord wants every brother and every sister to be called Cephas, so that persons understand that you yourself are contributing your own part to what is going on livingly in the assembly.<a name=178:2></a> Perhaps sisters may inquire how they contribute their part, seeing that they are not allowed to take part vocally in the assembly save in having part in the singing and in the amens, but they contribute their part just as really and as substantially as brothers, for they bring into the assembly affection for Christ, and affection for God the Father, and intelligence too, in the Spirit they bring in feelings and intelligence that are capable of being unified, in the power of the Spirit, with what is there with the rest of the brethren.<a name=178:3></a> In what is living they contribute much to the substance and wealth that is there, and every sister as well as every brother should recognise that this is why God has taken us up.<a name=178:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now with that in mind, the early part of the gospel of John shows us individuals who are led, held, and fitted for that, and this woman in the fourth chapter of the gospel of John is illustrative of it.<a name=178:5></a> What is so remarkable is that in spite of what this woman is we have the Lord personally serving her and dealing with her, and He introduces her to the truth of the Holy Spirit, the living water, and He leads to the thought of the Father, and the Father seeking worshippers, individuals who are constituted worshippers, not as I said in any formal way, but in the character of what springs up within; for that is the figure used in regard of the living water.<a name=178:6></a> That is a great necessity, dear brethren, that every brother and sister should understand that the Lord is ready to serve him individually so that this might come to pass, and the Spirit is ready to serve him individually, and the Father is appreciative of our movements of affection and response toward Him.<a name=178:7></a> It is of great importance that everyone should understand that

		the whole Godhead, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are interested in us personally, and are concerned about our being set free from everything that would hinder us from functioning in the assembly.<a name=179:1></a> The Lord was weary and sitting on this well to which the woman came.<a name=179:2></a> "Jesus therefore, being wearied with the way he had come, sat just as he was at the fountain.<a name=179:3></a>" That is He sat there a weary Man.<a name=179:4></a> Why does it tell us that?<a name=179:5></a> I believe it is to convey to us how very near the Lord Jesus has come to us, so near that He could actually experience weariness.<a name=179:6></a> It is to convey to us how sympathetic He is, how tender He is, that He understands and enters feelingly, sin apart, into the experiences that we may ourselves have part in.<a name=179:7></a> That is of very great encouragement, because the Lord in sitting on the well in that way was available to this woman.<a name=179:8></a> He was intending to convey that she need not be afraid to entrust her difficulties, and you might say, her secrets and her exercises to Him.<a name=179:9></a> He wanted to gain her confidence, so He said, "Give me to drink.<a name=179:10></a>" Wonderful thing to see Him who had created the fountains of water say to a woman, "Give me to drink.<a name=179:11></a>" It is a very touching expression of the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, that He was actually asking a drink of a Samaritan woman in order to gain her confidence, and this is how the Lord will act with any one of us in order to gain our confidence, because He wants to gain and hold our confidence, and we will never cultivate individual dealings with the Lord unless He has gained our confidence.<a name=179:12></a> "Jesus says to her, Give me to drink (for his disciples had gone away into the city that they might buy provisions).<a name=179:13></a> The Samaritan woman therefore says to him, How dost thou, being a Jew, ask to drink of me who am a Samaritan woman?<a name=179:14></a> for Jews have no intercourse with Samaritans.<a name=179:15></a>" He has gained her confidence, so He immediately says, "If thou knewest the gift

	<div class="paragraph">
		You can see how skilfully the Lord is moving in order to engage her confidence and interest and increase it.<a name=180:2></a> He says, "who it is that says to thee," to raise the question in her mind as to who He was.<a name=180:3></a> We may well raise that question in our minds as we have to do with the Lord.<a name=180:4></a> We all know who He is, but are we impressed with the fact that it is open to us to have to do personally with the Son, with the Son as come so near to us, the Word who became flesh and tabernacled among men, actually moving in and out among men as accessible to them.<a name=180:5></a> "Thou wouldest have asked of him; and he would have given thee living water.<a name=180:6></a>" That engages her interest all the more, she begins to ask questions until she is brought to this point that she says, "Give me this water, that I may not thirst nor come here to draw.<a name=180:7></a>" He had said, "Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again; but whosoever drinks of the water which I shall give him shall never thirst for ever, but the water which I shall give him shall become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life.<a name=180:8></a>" You can understand the woman saying, I do not know that I understand what that means, but at least it sounds attractive.<a name=180:9></a> "Never thirst for ever.<a name=180:10></a>" Think of the possibility of never being unsatisfied, of never thirsting, of a fountain in oneself springing up into eternal life, and you can understand that, however little the woman understood, it would be attractive.<a name=180:11></a> That is what the Lord wants, He wants us to be attracted by the possibility of never thirsting for ever, of being made superior to the desires of the flesh within, and the influence and power of the world around, so that we find our life in things that cannot be affected by death, and know what it is to enjoy eternal life.<a name=180:12></a>

		The result of His speaking to the woman in this way is that she says, "Give me this water"; she wants it.<a name=181:1></a> I would urge, that, if you cannot say that you know something of the service and power of the Holy Spirit as satisfying you with divine things, that you get to the Lord about it, ask Him to make it a reality to you.<a name=181:2></a> The Lord loves to see definiteness in His people.<a name=181:3></a> "Ask, and it shall be given to you; seek and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you," <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#11:9">Luke  11:9</a>.<a name=181:4></a> These are three unconditional promises, and it is for us to take them up and have to do with the Lord about these matters.<a name=181:5></a> "Give me this water, that I may not thirst nor come here to draw.<a name=181:6></a> Jesus says to her, Go, call thy husband.<a name=181:7></a>" Up till now He did not raise a single question as to her past.<a name=181:8></a> He was encouraging her to move in the direction of what He was preparing to give her, and now that she has expressed a desire, and her interest is aroused, He puts His finger on the whole secret of her life.<a name=181:9></a> What for?<a name=181:10></a> Was it to expose her?<a name=181:11></a> It was not, save to herself.<a name=181:12></a> The disciples had all gone into the city to buy food.<a name=181:13></a> There was no reason for them all to have gone, but it was no doubt of God that they went, so that the woman might be alone with the Lord, and if the Lord is going to expose us.<a name=181:14></a> He only exposes us to ourselves, and that for our good.<a name=181:15></a> He puts His finger upon the secret of this woman's life in saying to her, "Go, call thy husband, and come here.<a name=181:16></a>" What is the result?<a name=181:17></a> She says, "I see that thou art a prophet," but more than a prophet was there.<a name=181:18></a> We have to do with One far greater than merely a prophet.<a name=181:19></a> One who knows the secrets of our hearts, and not only knows the secrets, a prophet might know that if God enlightened him.<a name=181:20></a> There are instances of prophets knowing people's secrets.<a name=181:21></a> The wife of Jeroboam disguised herself and went to Ahijah who was blind, and it says "as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of

		Jacob divides itself into two periods, one of them commencing with the light which God gave him in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#28">Genesis  28</a>, of God's house, and terminating in chapter 35 where Jacob is found completely in accord with it, and the second period beginning with the light which God gave him in chapter 37 through Joseph's dreams and finishing at the end of his career.<a name=193:1></a> I want to touch on these two divisions in the life of Jacob.<a name=193:2></a> One is connected with the light of the house of God and has reference to our being adjusted and formed, on what I may speak of as moral lines.<a name=193:3></a> When I speak of moral lines, one has in mind matters of good and evil, and we have to learn that our standards of good and evil as being Christians, are not to be governed by the standards of men, but are to be governed by an unerring and unwavering standard which is that of the house of God, what is befitting to it.<a name=193:4></a> Then the second period of training, so to speak, has reference not so much to what is moral, but to what is spiritual, and raises the question as to what order of things we are going to find our life in, in the natural order of things, or whether we are going to have an apprehension by the Spirit of the spiritual order of things bound up with Christ and finding its expression at the present time in the assembly, the great administrative system of which Christ is the Head and in which we are intended to have part as a present matter, as, indeed, our commanding interest.<a name=193:5></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Following on that experience in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#32">Genesis  32</a>, Jacob goes a little further.<a name=196:10></a> He still has not gone quite the whole length when we come to chapter 35, and God says to him, "Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there, and make there an altar unto the God that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.<a name=196:11></a>" It is a question of a definite understanding by us of the house of God, the assembly of the living God, and that as regards our conduct, our standards of right and wrong, these matters are not to be regulated by what is current among men,

		but are to be regulated by what is suitable to God in those who compose His house.<a name=197:1></a> The result of this word to go up to Bethel and dwell there, was that Jacob said to his household and to all that were with him, "Put away the strange gods that are among you, and cleanse yourselves, and change your garments.<a name=197:2></a>" It necessarily involves certain exercises, certain looking around, so to speak, as to what it is we are carrying along with us, as to what our ordinary manner of life is, as to what our associations may be, for garments often refer to associations in which we move and appear among men; Jacob says all these things are to be taken into account.<a name=197:3></a> They are to be brought under review in the light of the house of God.<a name=197:4></a> "Put away the strange gods that are among you, and cleanse yourselves, and change your garments," and the result is, "they gave to Jacob all the strange gods that were in their hand, and the rings that were in their ears, and Jacob hid them under the terebinth that is by Shechem.<a name=197:5></a>" Then the next verse shows how God acknowledges and honours anyone who moves in exercise on these lines.<a name=197:6></a> "The terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.<a name=197:7></a>" Remember what God said to Eli, "Them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed," <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#2:30">1 Samuel  2:30</a>.<a name=197:8></a> It is a great thing, dear brethren, to be honoured by God, and the way to be honoured by God is to honour Him.<a name=197:9></a> "Them that honour me I will honour.<a name=197:10></a>" So because Jacob had honoured God He placed His own terror upon the cities that were around in order that Jacob should go through unmolested.<a name=197:11></a>

		I pass on to the other section of Jacob's training and it has its roots, I believe, in the dreams which Joseph had and which he recounted to his brethren and his father, for you will notice that the Spirit of God particularly says, "And his brethren envied him; but his father kept the saying," <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#37:11">Genesis  37:11</a>.<a name=198:16></a>

		to the future.<a name=201:1></a> If the first dream links very largely with the epistle to the Colossians, the second dream links with the epistle to the Ephesians, for it presents Christ as typified in Joseph as Head of all principality and power and exalted to the highest place, as <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:20">Ephesians  1:20</a>, 21 says, "He set him down at his right hand in the heavenlies, above every principality, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name named.<a name=201:2></a>" But it is now more particularly the administration which Christ has under His hand in the assembly at the present time, that I had in mind to speak of for the moment, and that is, I believe, why the history of Joseph is brought in now for several chapters.<a name=201:3></a> Joseph is seen as one who suffered.<a name=201:4></a> He is presented typically as one who died and is raised again.<a name=201:5></a> He is spoken of in Moses' song in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#33:16">Deuteronomy  33:16</a>, as the one "that was separated from his brethren," and this is the position with our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=201:6></a> He is separated from His own by death and resurrection, or it may be from His earthly people.<a name=201:7></a> In whatever way you view it, He is separated from them by death and resurrection.<a name=201:8></a> Joseph, of course, did not die literally.<a name=201:9></a> He was put down into the pit, but the Spirit of God says there was no water in it, and he was drawn up out of the pit; he was sold into Egypt; he was put into the prison in Egypt, and then brought out of the prison.<a name=201:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is great detail entering into Joseph's own formation, but the final position we come to in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#41">Genesis  41</a>is that he is in great exaltation.<a name=201:11></a> He is second only to Pharaoh.<a name=201:12></a> Pharaoh says to him, "I am Pharaoh; and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt.<a name=201:13></a>" Then, very interestingly, what is brought in at this point is the question of the administration of food.<a name=201:14></a> I am sure all will agree that the question of spiritual food is an important matter.<a name=201:15></a> We shall languish as saints if we have not spiritual food, and spiritual

		food becomes prominent at this point in Joseph's history.<a name=202:1></a> God had given Pharaoh light that there should be seven years of great plenty, and then this should be followed by seven years of famine, and as a result, Joseph is established in the place of administration in order to conserve and administer the food supply.<a name=202:2></a> That is what the Lord Jesus is doing at the present time in a spiritual sense.<a name=202:3></a> I believe it is right to say that, spiritually, the seven years of plenty and the seven years of famine are going on alongside one another, for there is no question that this is a period of great plenty for those who are in a position to receive it.<a name=202:4></a> There is no lack in the fulness of Christ, and there is no lack in spiritual ministry at the present time, there is great plenty, but, on the other hand, if you look abroad, there is very great famine of spiritual food outside the realm where the Lord Jesus administers.<a name=202:5></a> In the application of this passage to our souls, the two periods of seven years of plenty and of famine are going on together.<a name=202:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another thing to be noted and that is that although Joseph was established in the place of administration of food by Pharaoh, before he commenced his administration we are told that Pharaoh gave him a wife, namely, "Asnath, the daughter of Potipherah the priest in On.<a name=202:7></a>" Then later on in the chapter she is again referred to, and again it is stated she is "the daughter of Potipherah the priest in On.<a name=202:8></a>" It is as though the Spirit of God is emphasising what is priestly, and what is priestly means that suited moral conditions are maintained, for the priest always considers for God and what is due to God in His house.<a name=202:9></a> This is a most important matter.<a name=202:10></a> While all spiritual wealth is in the hands of the Lord Jesus, "In him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily," <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:9">Colossians  2:9</a>, yet the administration of it among the saints is dependent on suited moral conditions being found with us.<a name=202:11></a> The two have to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		be allied.<a name=203:1></a> Before Joseph enters upon his administration, he is given this priestly wife.<a name=203:2></a> That is a very important thing because the administration of food works out in localities.<a name=203:3></a> That is clearly indicated here where it says, "He gathered up all the food .<a name=203:4></a>.<a name=203:5></a>.<a name=203:6></a> and put the food in the cities.<a name=203:7></a>" In general, the administration of spiritual food amongst God's people is carried on in the local companies.<a name=203:8></a> It is there and there only that it finds expression.<a name=203:9></a> Largely, it is maintained through those who constitute the local companies, but there is also what is additional in the way of gift which is, so to speak, a further touch of the Lord Jesus Christ in His consideration for the assembly.<a name=203:10></a> He furnishes gifts, and they are not confined in the exercise of their gift to any one locality, but the actual administration of it is in the local companies, and this is a great thing to bear in mind, but before the administration can take place there must be found suitable moral conditions.<a name=203:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That was particularly emphasised in the history of God's people in the days of Eli.<a name=203:12></a> The moral conditions in the days of Eli were as bad as they could be, and what was the result?<a name=203:13></a> It says, "The word of Jehovah was rare in those days; a vision was not frequent," <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#3:1">1 Samuel  3:1</a>.<a name=203:14></a> There was nothing that you could call spiritual food.<a name=203:15></a> Why was that?<a name=203:16></a> It was not that God's hand was shortened.<a name=203:17></a> It was not that His love to His people was any less, but the conditions among God's people precluded the food being given.<a name=203:18></a> There was one woman in Israel, Hannah, who felt it keenly in exercise before God, and in answer to her exercise Samuel was given, and with Samuel there began to arise consideration for God.<a name=203:19></a> Before he developed as a prophet, he was morally a priest, for we are told, "Samuel ministered before Jehovah, a boy girded with a linen ephod.<a name=203:20></a>" He was not officially a priest for he was not of Aaron's family, but he was morally a priest as over against

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another result brought in in this chapter of suited moral conditions being found, another result of the alliance of Asnath with Joseph, and that is, two sons were born to Joseph.<a name=204:14></a> They are suggestive of what the saints are to Christ at the present time; Manasseh meaning, "For God has made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house," and Ephraim meaning, "For God has caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction," or as the name itself means, <i>Doubly fruitful</i>.<a name=204:15></a> All that is very suggestive of what the Lord Jesus finds in the assembly at the present time.<a name=204:16></a> There is what more than compensates Him for all that He has suffered at the hands of His earthly people, causing Him to forget all His toil and affliction,

		The Spirit of God through Paul says in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:46">1 Corinthians  15:46</a>, "That which is spiritual was not first, but that which is natural, then that which is spiritual," indicating that, all along, God has had in mind what is spiritual as His final thought.<a name=205:11></a> He brought in the natural and the earthly merely as testimony in His ways, but He has now reached the spiritual in that our Lord Jesus Christ is a quickening spirit, and this is the day of the Holy Spirit, and the blessings are spiritual and heavenly in character.<a name=205:12></a> Therefore it is

		a question for everyone of us to ask himself, How far he is finding his life practically in the things that are above; that is, morally above, in the things connected with Christ and with His assembly which, is for the moment down here on earth?<a name=206:1></a> The assembly is not earthly, it is heavenly; it is on earth in the ways of God in testimony at the present time and for God's service, but it is heavenly: heavenly in its origin and destiny as the vision given to Peter in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10">Acts  10</a>clearly shows.<a name=206:2></a> It is just that which was raised with Jacob in this second part of his history, as to where in fact he was going to find his life and interests and whether he was spiritual or unspiritual.<a name=206:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We may be good Christians on moral lines and our conduct may be blameless, measured by the standards of what is fitting in the house of God, but the next question arises as to whether we are spiritual, whether we are finding our life in the things of the Spirit, and that was exactly the test proposed to Jacob.<a name=206:4></a> He had lost sight of Joseph, and did not know that he was alive, far less had he any conception of the glorious administration that existed under his hand.<a name=206:5></a> Joseph's great desire was that Jacob should come down to him where he was.<a name=206:6></a> He should leave his own sphere of things and find his life and interest in Joseph's circle of interests and Joseph's message is that he will maintain him and his little ones.<a name=206:7></a> By command of Pharaoh, Joseph sends his brethren back with wagons, and it says they came to Jacob, their father, "and told him, saying, Joseph is still alive and he is governor over all the land of Egypt.<a name=206:8></a> And his heart fainted, for he did not believe them," <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#45:26">Genesis  45:26</a>.<a name=206:9></a> How easily unbelief may find a place with us, dear brethren.<a name=206:10></a> "He did not believe them.<a name=206:11></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is no excuse for us if we are marked by unbelief, for we have the Holy Spirit and He has come to bear testimony to the glory of Christ.<a name=206:12></a> The Scriptures are full of it.<a name=206:13></a> If we read the Scriptures,

		I want to speak, dear brethren, of serving God, and to seek to show the encouragement there is in the Scriptures for every one of us, whether it be brother or sister, to be here definitely as serving God.<a name=209:1></a> The scripture we commenced with in Isaiah is one of particular encouragement, for Jehovah says that it is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, those who serve Him, that "No weapon that is prepared against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that riseth against thee in judgment, thou shalt condemn.<a name=209:2></a>" He says, "This is the inheritance of the servants of Jehovah; and their righteousness is of me, saith Jehovah.<a name=209:3></a>" It is as though God would say to everyone who is prepared to take up the exercise of serving Him, whatever form that service may take, that they can afford to do so in singleness of heart with the assurance that God will stand by them.<a name=209:4></a> He will, of course, afford to them any adjustment that they may need.<a name=209:5></a> He will have His own way with them.<a name=209:6></a> The Scriptures are full of God's ways with His servants, but He would at the outset say that the servant need not be concerned about what others think or say about them, if, in fact, they are in singleness of heart serving God.<a name=209:7></a> "Their righteousness," Jehovah says, "is of me.<a name=209:8></a>" In speaking of serving God, one is not limiting one's thoughts to serving in ministry or anything of that kind.<a name=209:9></a> I think the Scriptures read will show that <i>servants of God</i> is a term that goes far wider than serving in the power of gift in the ministry of the word or in the gospel.<a name=209:10></a> Certainly there is no suggestion of any such thing in the case of Job, yet he is one of whom God speaks as "My servant

		Job.<a name=210:1></a>" The thought of serving God is a very wide one.<a name=210:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to refer to these cases of Job and Caleb and David and Anna in order to indicate different aspects in which serving God shows itself, and also to show, not only, as the verse in Isaiah says, how God stands by those who serve Him, but also to show how He takes in hand any discipline that may be needed in order that they may serve Him more effectively.<a name=210:3></a> God will take that in hand Himself.<a name=210:4></a> I do not think you can read of any servant in the scripture who is not disciplined.<a name=210:5></a> In the case of Job the service that marked him in the first instance was that he was characterised by personal piety, concerned as to himself and his household to maintain practically what was pleasing to God.<a name=210:6></a> He was thus characteristically a servant of God, and God calls Satan's attention to him.<a name=210:7></a> That is a serious matter, you might say a surprising matter, that God should call Satan's attention to a servant of His, for God knew well that if Satan were allowed a free hand it would be in opposition to those who serve God.<a name=210:8></a> Yet God calls Satan's attention to Job, with the result that Satan was allowed to put his hand upon him to a remarkable extent, affecting him in his circumstances in a most grievous way, and affecting him also in his body and in his health.<a name=210:9></a> What God had in mind was to bring out, I believe, the indestructibility of His own work in Job.<a name=210:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In speaking to Satan in chapter 1 about Job, God calls him "My servant Job," and similarly in chapter 2, but in the remaining chapters to chapter 41 inclusive, there is no reference to "My servant Job.<a name=210:11></a>" In chapter 42, four times over in a very short space of time, God uses the same expression and says "My servant Job.<a name=210:12></a>" That is what Job was as serving God.<a name=210:13></a> He had come through in no way damaged by what God allowed Satan to bring upon him; but

		In order to bring Job to this point, God brought before him His wonderful wisdom and majesty, and concluded by drawing his attention to the creature who is king over all the children of pride.<a name=211:10></a> No one was able to handle him but God.<a name=211:11></a> I believe it is an allusion to Satan, one who cannot be handled by anyone but God, but then we are in the light of this, that God has handled Satan.<a name=211:12></a> The Son of God has been manifested, to "undo the works of the devil", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:8">1 John  3:8</a>.<a name=211:13></a> That is a wonderful thing, and the manner of the undoing of the works of the devil has been most marvellous, bringing to light what God is in His blessedness.<a name=211:14></a> Think of it, that the Son of God should have come in manhood, an incorruptible Man, and has met Satan and been into death to accomplish redemption, yielding Himself to pay the full price needed if redemption was to be effected, and that we might receive the Holy Spirit, and be

		Well, now, the epistle to the Ephesians, I need not say, is written from the standpoint of the exaltation of Christ, as, indeed, we are told in this very epistle that God has "set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named," <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:20">Ephesians  1:20</a>, 21.<a name=224:5></a> We are in the presence, in this epistle, of the greatest conceivable exaltation, the greatest conceivable elevation too in a moral sense, and that is to give us an idea of the kind of riches, so to speak, into which we are introduced.<a name=224:6></a> The greatest thoughts of God are now to be opened up to us, and Christ is already there as Man in the position from which those thoughts are unfolded.<a name=224:7></a> That is a great thing to take account of.<a name=224:8></a> In olden times, Abraham and others saw things as God revealed them to them, distantly.<a name=224:9></a> "Abraham," the Lord says, "rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad," <a href="../bible/John.htm#8:56">John  8:56</a>.<a name=224:10></a> At the same time, what he saw was still in the distance, but things are no longer in the distance.<a name=224:11></a> Christ is already

		What I am seeking to stress is that the day for these things has come, in that Christ is already in the position which the purpose of God has marked out for Him as Man, and the Spirit has come.<a name=225:4></a> The day for heavenly things and spiritual things has come.<a name=225:5></a> That is what one wants to reach, that the day for these things is now.<a name=225:6></a> We are not to put them off till the future, and so the apostle says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us.<a name=225:7></a>" The apostle can speak in that way.<a name=225:8></a> He is dealing with God, and with God's standpoint, so to speak, and, as I say, Christ is already in that position, and in Jesus where He is is the setting out of what God has in His thoughts for us.<a name=225:9></a> It is well for us to take that in, and so the apostle can say that God "hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ.<a name=225:10></a>" He has chosen us, he says, "in him before the foundation of the world.<a name=225:11></a>" It is remarkable the scope that is covered in one or two verses, going back to before the foundation of the world, eternity in the past, if one may speak of the past in relation to eternity; going back to that, and then looking on to what is called the administration

		We have often gone over these things, dear brethren, but it is well to go over them again to get our minds and spirits saturated with the sense of the blessedness of God operating entirely from His own side; not presented as actuated by any question of need on our part or desire, for indeed these matters go back to before the foundation of the world, but choosing us for His own pleasure, choosing us in Christ.<a name=226:4></a> One sees, dear brethren, what divine purpose is, how marvellous it is!<a name=226:5></a> How from the very outset, when once the thoughts of divine love were conceived, the incarnation was in view, as, you might say, the keystone of all that God was going to effect.<a name=226:6></a> He chose us in Christ.<a name=226:7></a> The explanation of it, of course, is that all is "according to the good pleasure of his will.<a name=226:8></a>" It is not a question of what might meet our most exaggerated thoughts or desires; it is a question entirely of what will satisfy the heart of God.<a name=226:9></a> You might say, why should God desire it?<a name=226:10></a> Well, it is a matter for us to consider, why indeed?<a name=226:11></a> I was speaking of different ones who were moved in a spirit of worship.<a name=226:12></a> Paul, himself, is another remarkable instance.<a name=226:13></a> So blessedly did he know God that in writing an epistle like Romans, he constantly bursts out in doxology.<a name=226:14></a> In chapter 1, he refers to God as Creator, saying of men, that they "worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who

		We must acknowledge that there is much to be done yet if the saints are to be brought into full possession of all that God has in His mind for them.<a name=237:1></a> With all the light that God has given us, and the Lord has been giving us much light, we must acknowledge we have a long way to go yet as regards actually getting into these things in power.<a name=237:2></a> So that Joshua, seeing what was needed there, called upon the sun to stand still.<a name=237:3></a> He seeks that the full shining of Christ should continue, the sun stood still in the midst of heaven.<a name=237:4></a> It is a question of appealing, so to speak, that the full shining of Christ should be brought to bear powerfully upon the saints.<a name=237:5></a> "Arise, shine: for thy light is come," <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#60:1">Isaiah  60:1</a>.<a name=237:6></a> The apostle says, "Wake up, thou that sleepest, and arise up from among the dead, and the Christ shall shine upon thee," <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:14">Ephesians  5:14</a>.<a name=237:7></a> It is a question of prayer that calls upon God to cause the light of Christ and all that it means to shine powerfully upon the present situation, that the saints should be brought into their inheritance.<a name=237:8></a> So Paul, in the epistle to the Ephesians, doubtless feeling that it was beyond even his ability to set out at great length what the thoughts of God were, and indeed if there were any attempt to define them it would but limit them, whereas in fact, they are illimitable, just sets out enough to convey the mind of God in outline and to incite interest in it on our part, and then he prays.<a name=237:9></a> He tells us in chapter 1 at great length what he prays, and in chapter 3 he prays again, that the Father would strengthen us with might by His, the Father's, Spirit "in the inner man; that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith.<a name=237:10></a>" It is as though he is crying to the Father that He would cause the Christ to shine, and to shine unchallenged upon the hearts of the saints.<a name=237:11></a> That is what Paul does, he prays, he bows his knees.<a name=237:12></a> There was never a day like this day in Joshua which extended about the length of

		two days, and that is what this present dispensation is doing.<a name=238:1></a> It is being extended about the length of two days.<a name=238:2></a> "One day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day," <a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#3:8">2 Peter  3:8</a>.<a name=238:3></a> This great dispensation is being extended because God has His choicest thoughts to effectuate in the saints.<a name=238:4></a> So what is needed in addition to what we do ourselves and what Christ does from heaven is that there may be power to pray, and power to pray in a way that will prevail: "And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the Lord hearkened unto the voice of a man.<a name=238:5></a>" A man commanded the situation.<a name=238:6></a> You may rest assured the more we pray in relation to these great things, the more God will answer it in bringing the saints into them in power.<a name=238:7></a> Paul prays in chapter 3, and in chapter 6 he urges us, to pray and persevere in it for all the saints.<a name=238:8></a> He enlarges on the necessity for prayer.<a name=238:9></a> As to this great victory, it says, "There was no day like that before it or after it, that the Lord hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the Lord fought for Israel.<a name=238:10></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		That is all I had to say, to stimulate us in the recognition of the importance of this day, the great things that God has in mind for the saints that we are to be brought into.<a name=238:11></a> I repeat that it is not a question of waiting until the Lord comes, to bring us into these things.<a name=238:12></a> What Ephesians has in mind is not the future but the present, the saints entering into their portion at the present time.<a name=238:13></a> There is ministry from the Christ in glory; there is also what each is to do as a joint of supply contributing his own part; and then, finally, there is the great power of prayer, prayer exercised by those who have power with God, for God will hearken to the voice of the man who is in the appreciation of His thoughts regarding the assembly and desires that the saints may come into them.<a name=238:14></a>

		We were speaking this afternoon, dear brethren, of Joseph in relation to his brethren, and all the feelings which were found with Joseph, and I have read these scriptures as indicating, I believe, something of the feelings of Christ in regard of the saints as finding expression through Paul, because every right feeling in regard of the saints has been derived from Christ.<a name=239:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#28">Exodus  28</a>we have in Aaron clothed with the garments of glory and beauty, a type of Christ in His present position and service on high as personally sustaining the whole service of God in the assembly down here on earth.<a name=239:2></a> If you will remember, on the skirts of the cloak of the high priest were pomegranates and bells, the pomegranates being very suggestive of the local assemblies, each pomegranate being complete in itself and yet each setting out the idea of unity in itself.<a name=239:3></a> Then along with the pomegranates, suggestive of the local companies in their unity and fruitfulness under the eye of God, there were golden bells, suggesting that there is not only what is for the pleasure of God in the local companies, but also there is to be testimony, the bells undoubtedly referring to that.<a name=239:4></a> Paul says in 1 Thessalonians, "the word of the Lord sounded out from you.<a name=239:5></a>" The remarkable thing is that all these are presented as on the skirts of the cloak of the high priest; that is, they are all sustained and supported by the high priest personally.<a name=239:6></a> When you begin to think of what there is in the world today of true assembly character in all but one, at any rate, of the continents, you can understand how immense is the service of Christ in sustaining that for the pleasure of God day in and day out, and I might say night in and night out,

		Another thing to be remembered is that it is supported feelingly, for the people of God were carried on the high priest's shoulders according to their birth, referring, I believe, to what the Lord Jesus is doing as interceding for every one of us individually at the present time.<a name=240:2></a> <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:34">Romans  8:34</a> states that and adds, "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?<a name=240:3></a> shall tribulation or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?<a name=240:4></a>" All finds its answer in the intercession which the love of Christ is carrying on at the present time, and not only so, but the names of the children of Israel were borne in four rows of three on the breastplate of the High Priest, the breastplate of judgment, and the four rows of three undoubtedly allude to the four camps of three tribes each in which the people of God were set around the tabernacle; that is, it refers to the saints as committed publicly to the testimony of God in their various local settings, tribal settings, using the type, and in that setting also, not merely in the individual needs and pressures and testings of the saints, but in connection with the exercises which they have as seeking to move together in their respective localities, the saints are being borne up before God by the Lord Jesus continually on the breastplate of judgment, meaning that He has a perfect judgment as to the conditions that exist in every locality.<a name=240:5></a> He has a perfect knowledge of them, and a perfect judgment as to them; a judgment as to what is the cause of anything that is lacking or unsatisfactory; a judgment as to what is the need in each locality.<a name=240:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a great thing to have a sense, that the heart of Christ is caring for the saints, but caring for them, if I may venture to use the expression, feelingly and intelligently; that is caring for them in relation to
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=241>[Page 241]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		what the thoughts of God concerning them are, and having no less desire than that there should be a complete answer to those thoughts amongst the saints.<a name=241:1></a> We see that in Epaphras in Colossians.<a name=241:2></a> He had learned from Christ, for he continued urgently in prayer that the saints at Colosse should stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.<a name=241:3></a> He was not content with half measures; however far they might have attained, he wanted them to go still further, and we may rest assured, dear brethren, as knowing something of the Lord Jesus, as knowing how characteristically He is devoted to the will of God, that He will not rest content until a perfect answer to God's thoughts is found amongst His people.<a name=241:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I have said that much by way of introduction, but also to impress us with this thought of the feelings of the heart of Christ, and how those feelings will find expression and reproduction in those who are near to Him.<a name=241:5></a> That is particularly seen in Paul, for I have no doubt Paul stands out head and shoulders above anyone else in this matter of feeling for the saints.<a name=241:6></a> He says in 2 Corinthians, "the crowd of cares pressing on me daily, the burden of all the assemblies," and at the same time it was not limited to the state of the assemblies, but his interest in the saints was individual as well; so he says further, "Who is stumbled, and I burn not?<a name=241:7></a>" If he heard of one stumbled soul, one young brother or sister it might be, who was stumbled, his heart burned at the thought of it, his spiritual indignation, so to speak, was awakened as he heard of even one soul amongst the saints being stumbled.<a name=241:8></a> So if Paul could be marked by similar feelings, there is no reason why we should not be also, in our measure.<a name=241:9></a> I do not think it was exactly apostolic, although no doubt his position as apostle largely contributed to it, but feelings of this kind are not a matter of gift, they are a matter of being near to the Lord, and of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		getting an impression in nearness to Christ of what His own feelings are in regard of the saints.<a name=242:1></a> So the apostle, as concluding his second letter to the Corinthians says, "For the rest, brethren, rejoice.<a name=242:2></a>" That is his final word to us.<a name=242:3></a> The Corinthian epistle, as we know, deals with the saints in their local settings as committed in the locality where they live to the testimony of God; whereas the Colossian saints are viewed in connection with heavenly truth, the universal setting of the assembly, and in both settings we get the apostle's feelings in regard of the saints coming out in these verses we have read.<a name=242:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In writing to the Corinthians, Paul had addressed them in both epistles as "the assembly of God which is in Corinth.<a name=242:5></a>" Brethren will, I am sure, understand that in nothing I am saying am I assuming that the saints in this place, or anywhere else, moving together in the truth, claim to be the assembly of God, or can claim to be that.<a name=242:6></a> That would be presumption, because we represent only a fraction of the whole number of saints that there are, but in the mercy of God we have been delivered from captivity; for the church as a whole is in captivity to the world, but we are living in days in which God has wrought to deliver some of His people from captivity, and we are among those set free, that is our position.<a name=242:7></a> Just as in the days of Ezra and Nehemiah, those who came up from captivity were enabled of God to build the house and to set up the service of God in it; and to build the wall and dedicate it with the gates proper to it, so in this our day those saints who have been set free from what is contrary to God, are in a position, if they will go on with the Lord and with the Spirit, and govern themselves by the truth that relates to the assembly; to enjoy every feature of the truth, although it be only in outward smallness and weakness.<a name=242:8></a> Therefore we may take up humbly the thoughts of God regarding
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=243>[Page 243]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the assembly; and, indeed, dear brethren, if we do not, we are unrighteous, for there is no other truth than the truth of the assembly that can possibly regulate saints going on together.<a name=243:1></a> It is a matter of positive righteousness as we seek to go on together to regulate ourselves by the light that governs the assembly.<a name=243:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having said that, I return to what I was saying, that the apostle addressed both his epistles to the Corinthians to "the assembly of God which is in Corinth.<a name=243:3></a>" That is something to rejoice in, dear brethren; he says, "For the rest, brethren, rejoice," the idea being that at Blenheim, or any place you like to name, where any saints are available as delivered from what is opposed to the truth, there should be in that place something that answers to the thought of God's assembly.<a name=243:4></a> There should be a vessel in the place which the Lord claims as His own, "My assembly," and which He is prepared to sustain provided the conditions necessary are there; and in spite of all the evil that is around, in the very presence of it, that there should be what is available under the hand of Christ to maintain the service of God for His pleasure, and to maintain in the midst of the evil around a true light as to God, light as to His holiness and faithfulness, in unity amongst ourselves, and with the ability to deal with evil, if it should show itself, in a way according to God.<a name=243:5></a> All these things are features of glory, things that properly belong to the assembly of God, and it is a matter to rejoice in, dear brethren, that it is open to us to have our part in these great things.<a name=243:6></a> The time for it will soon be gone, the opportunity will soon be past.<a name=243:7></a> The days of our receiving up are near, and therefore the urgent need that we should all be of one mind, to provide under the hand of the Lord the conditions in which He can maintain the service of God and a true testimony to His name.<a name=243:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=244>[Page 244]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the apostle says, "For the rest, brethren, rejoice.<a name=244:1></a>" In each epistle he had linked a brother with himself, Sosthenes in the first epistle, and Timotheus in the second, in each case calling him "the brother.<a name=244:2></a>" That is, these two elements are always necessary if there is to be a prosperous condition of things in a local company.<a name=244:3></a> There must be what is authoritative on the one hand, not in the assertion of authority on the part of one not having it, but authoritative in the sense of the apostle's doctrine, and what is brotherly on the other.<a name=244:4></a> So he says, "For the rest, brethren, rejoice; be perfected; be encouraged; be of one mind; be at peace.<a name=244:5></a>" There is only one mind that is properly characteristic of the assembly, dear brethren.<a name=244:6></a> The apostle develops it in Philippians.<a name=244:7></a> He presents it in a most exalted form in <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2">Philippians  2</a>, saying, "Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus; who, subsisting in the form of God, did not esteem it an object of rapine to be on an equality with God; but emptied himself, taking a bondman's form, taking his place in the likeness of men.<a name=244:8></a>" No reputation!<a name=244:9></a> and a bondman!<a name=244:10></a> What a mind to shine out in one who is God, yet did not claim for Himself the glory and dignity proper to Deity, but took a bondman's form.<a name=244:11></a> It is possible that this mind should be in us.<a name=244:12></a> You will remember how Abigail was attracted by the light of God's anointed as found here in wilderness conditions, and how David sent a message to her that he wished her to become his wife.<a name=244:13></a> That is exactly what the Lord would say to us.<a name=244:14></a> He is here in testimony in wilderness conditions and He wants His assembly to be thoroughly united to Him in one mind and one thought; and Abigail said, "Let thy handmaid be a bondwoman to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.<a name=244:15></a>" She was, so to speak, of one mind with Christ who became a bondman, who assumed that form.<a name=244:16></a> She says, 'All

	<div class="paragraph">
		I want, my greatest aspiration, is to be a bondwoman to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.<a name=245:1></a>' That is the spirit in which things will prosper in any local company.<a name=245:2></a> How that will develop mutuality, and affection, and consideration for one another, just one or two moving in that spirit, with no other thought before them.<a name=245:3></a> And so she became united to David.<a name=245:4></a> So the apostle says, "Be of one mind, be at peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.<a name=245:5></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then he says, "Salute one another.<a name=245:6></a>" He is concerned about mutual feelings among the brethren.<a name=245:7></a> "Salute one another with a holy kiss.<a name=245:8></a>" It is a salutation that is to be holy.<a name=245:9></a> One is not suggesting that it be taken up literally in an actual kiss, but whatever form the greeting may take, whether kiss or handshake, greet one another with it in holiness.<a name=245:10></a> Let love be expressed in the salutation.<a name=245:11></a> "Salute one another with a holy kiss.<a name=245:12></a> All the saints salute you," that is, the saints at the place from which he was writing.<a name=245:13></a> "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.<a name=245:14></a>" So he brings in the whole Godhead, beginning with the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=245:15></a> That is, I believe, a subduing influence.<a name=245:16></a> It is a remarkable thing that he should not begin with God.<a name=245:17></a> One would have thought that as he was going to bring in the activity of the Godhead, he would have begun with God, but he begins with the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=245:18></a> It is a subduing influence.<a name=245:19></a> You will remember how the dew comes down from heaven, even Nebuchadnezzar was bathed with the dew of heaven.<a name=245:20></a> There was that subduing influence, so to speak, interwoven with God's governmental ways with that man.<a name=245:21></a> "His body was bathed with the dew of heaven till seven times had passed over him.<a name=245:22></a>" And so the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is a kind of subduing influence.<a name=245:23></a>

		The apostle says in this epistle, "Ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that for your sakes he being, rich; became poor, in order that <i>ye</i> by <i>his</i> poverty might be enriched," <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#8:9">2 Corinthians  8:9</a>.<a name=246:1></a> All that is to be carried in our minds.<a name=246:2></a> The apostle, with great feeling, as one expressive of this grace, brings it to bear upon us.<a name=246:3></a> You will remember how he appeals to them, saying in the first epistle, "For if ye should have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the glad tidings.<a name=246:4></a> I entreat you therefore, be my imitators," <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#4:15">1 Corinthians  4:15</a>.<a name=246:5></a> How the feelings of Paul come out in that way as expressive of the feelings of Christ!<a name=246:6></a> "I entreat you therefore, be my imitators.<a name=246:7></a>" He says in that same passage, "Railed at we bless; persecuted, we suffer it; insulted, we entreat; we are become as the offscouring of the world, the refuse of all, until now.<a name=246:8></a>" That is what he brings to bear upon the Corinthians, so that they might have before them in himself the pattern of true Christianity, and in order that it might be strengthened, he sends Timotheus, who, he says, "is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who shall put you in mind of my ways as they are in Christ, according as I teach everywhere in every assembly," <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#4:17">1 Corinthians  4:17</a>.<a name=246:9></a> It is a most important thing that the assembly is to be according to one pattern.<a name=246:10></a> Paul, like Moses coming down from the mountain with the pattern of the tabernacle, had the pattern in his mind before ministering and before coming to Corinth.<a name=246:11></a> He had the whole plan as a wise architect and he laid the foundation.<a name=246:12></a> A builder does not start to build until he has the plan.<a name=246:13></a> The plan is first drawn up, and then the work proceeds according to the plan, and Paul had the whole plan of the assembly as God had it in His mind; and not only did he minister the truth but he exemplified it in his ways as they are in Christ, as he says, "according

		Then Paul brings in Onesimus, whom he calls, "the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you.<a name=249:5></a>" You can see how Paul is fixing his eyes on the work of God in one and another.<a name=249:6></a> Onesimus, the runaway slave of Philemon had been converted and brought into touch with Paul while he was in bonds at Rome, and became converted.<a name=249:7></a> He belonged to Colosse, we may assume that Philemon lived at Colosse by comparing this with the epistle to Philemon.<a name=249:8></a> There seems to be no doubt that the two epistles were written at the same time and conveyed at the same time, probably by Onesimus himself.<a name=249:9></a> So Paul says, "Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you.<a name=249:10></a>" He had not been that when the Colossians last saw him, but now he was to return to them as a faithful and beloved brother, "who is one of you.<a name=249:11></a>" He would evidence amongst them the work of God who had taken up one from their very midst and converted him.<a name=249:12></a> We know how cheering it is when the work of God in an unlikely person in our midst comes to light in an unlikely way; how encouraging and stimulating it is to the hearts of the saints.<a name=249:13></a> Paul is not only ministering the truth, but bringing things to the notice of the brethren that will all help to stimulate their interest in divine things, and link them on in their affections

		I wish to speak, dear brethren, of the Father of glory and the Lord of glory and the Spirit of glory, three remarkable expressions involving the three Persons of the Godhead, and showing that each of Them is connected with the idea of glory.<a name=254:1></a> I hope the Lord may enable me to convey some impression that Christianity, as enjoyed down here, is a system of glory, not in any fanciful way or using in any sense extravagant expressions, but substantially it is a system of glory, and it is well that our eyes should be open to it, for the more we appreciate that it is so, the more we shall be delivered from any kind of hankering after this present world.<a name=254:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul, in writing to the Corinthians, says, "We speak God's wisdom in a mystery"; he says this of himself and his fellow-labourers.<a name=254:3></a> He does not speak of the wisdom of this world, but of that hidden wisdom which God had predetermined before the ages for our glory.<a name=254:4></a> He evidently contrasts this world, with its princes who, in ignorance of what is truly glorious, have crucified the Lord of glory, with a system of wisdom which God had predetermined before the ages for our glory.<a name=254:5></a> Evidently that implies that we are to glory in it.<a name=254:6></a> So I think it will be agreed, if we give a moment's thought to it, that to have some sense borne in upon us that we are having part now, by the grace of God and as drawn to Christ, and as having been sealed with the Holy Spirit, in a system of glory which God had predetermined before the ages for us, for ourselves, is something that might well stimulate us to know more about what it is that we have come into; and to be happily in it, because no one is so unsatisfied as a believer who tries to have a little bit of two worlds.<a name=254:7></a> A believer

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in writing to the Ephesians the apostle speaks of the Father of glory.<a name=255:3></a> We have in these passages I have read from Paul's ministry, and from James' ministry, and from Peter's ministry, evidence to show how unified the great apostles were in appreciating that what they were having part in with their fellow-believers was a system of glory.<a name=255:4></a> Paul, writing to the Ephesians, says, "Wherefore I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is in you, and the love which ye have towards all the saints, do not cease giving thanks for you, making mention of you at my prayers.<a name=255:5></a>" I believe that faith in the Lord Jesus as brought in in this epistle, does not merely refer to that initial faith which marks us as we believe the gospel, but rather to that settled faith which is characteristic of established believers, that their affections, and their faith as entering into their affections, are livingly and abidingly connected with Christ where He is.<a name=255:6></a> "The Lord Jesus" is an expression peculiar to Paul's ministry and expresses the way in which Christ is held affectionately by those composing the assembly.<a name=255:7></a> It is a combination of the reverential address that is due to our Lord Jesus Christ in view of who He is, with that personal appreciation of Christ and knowledge of Him which is unique to the assembly.<a name=255:8></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These features proper to the assembly were seen in the Ephesian saints, and Paul, as having heard of it, says, "I .<a name=257:4></a>.<a name=257:5></a>.<a name=257:6></a> do not cease giving thanks for you, making mention of you at my prayers, that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, would give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of him.<a name=257:7></a>" It is a remarkable presentation of God, that He should be spoken of as the God of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=257:8></a> It is clearly, presenting the Lord Jesus as Man, apprehended as such where He is, and the very expression, our Lord Jesus Christ, I believe, involves the thought that we are associated with Him in that position in which He is apprehended.<a name=257:9></a> But that God should be spoken of as the God of our Lord Jesus Christ; that is, God in relation to men, of whom Christ Himself in manhood is the pattern!<a name=257:10></a> Think of God having men before Him who take character from Christ, who will, indeed, appear before God in the image and likeness of Christ.<a name=257:11></a> Think what a conception it is!<a name=257:12></a> That is what God has in mind in regard of the sons of men, His own creatures.<a name=257:13></a> The subject is wonderful, dear brethren, that there should be such a Man in the presence of God, the second Person of the Godhead become Man in order that all His thoughts regarding men might be established for His pleasure by bringing into manhood an order of excellence that could not possibly attach to the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the apostle, speaking in this way of God, calls Him the Father of glory; that is, He is the source of all that is true glory; there is much glory at the present time attached to this world, glory of a kind, but it will all pass away.<a name=258:3></a> You will remember on one occasion the devil showed the Lord Jesus in a moment of time all the kingdoms of this world and their glory.<a name=258:4></a> He was wise to do it in a moment of time.<a name=258:5></a> If they were subjected to more than a moment's investigation, the utter worthlessness of man's glory would become apparent, but he unfolds it in a moment of time, and that is all the length of time, according to divine measurement, for which the glory of this world will last.<a name=258:6></a> Already it is crumbling to its foundations, but the God of our Lord Jesus Christ is the Father of glory, the source of all that is truly glorious as worthy of God.<a name=258:7></a> So Paul prays to God that He would give us "the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him, being enlightened in the eyes of your heart, so that ye should know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, and what the surpassing greatness of his power towards us who believe.<a name=258:8></a>" It means that we are to know.<a name=258:9></a> May I say at this point that one is impressed with this, that in the presence of the great things which Paul had in his heart as he wrote the epistle to the Ephesians, he makes no attempt to explain to them in great detail, but he prays, and he tells us what he prays.<a name=258:10></a> In the third chapter he tells us that he bowed his knees, meaning that there was intensity of exercise in his prayer, and I believe what is in mind in all this is, that if we would have a real apprehension

		of the things which God in His love has purposed for us, and would have the power to enter into them so that we touch them in some measure of power and enjoyment and reality, the great thing to do is to pray, and to pray on these lines; not, of course, uttering Paul's words as having learned them by heart and saying them, for there is no value in that, but as having direction to our exercises by what the apostle indicates as to the lines on which he prayed.<a name=259:1></a> I believe the point in all this is that if there is any attempt made unduly to define what spiritual blessings are, the inevitable result will be to limit them, whereas they are in fact illimitable.<a name=259:2></a> On the other hand, if there is the exercise and desire to enter into them which shows itself in continual prayer, we shall find that the Spirit of God, who has first-hand knowledge of these wonderful things, will give us more and more an entrance into them, so that we realise that what we are having part in is a system of glory.<a name=259:3></a> Paul prays that God "would give us the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of him, being enlightened in the eyes of your heart, so that ye should know what is the hope of his calling.<a name=259:4></a>"

		<a name=273>[Page 273]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the tabernacle were also to be of the same wood; so also were the table and the two altars, so you will see that the system was intended to take character from the ark.<a name=273:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing is to be noticed in connection with the ark viewed as the ark of the testimony, and that is, it is always, save possibly in the instance in <a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#4">Joshua  4</a>, presented as covered; that is, either covered by the veil, being within the holiest and therefore to be seen only by one going into the holiest, or when the system was in movement, covered actually by the veil, for the priests had to go in and take down the veil and with it cover the ark of the testimony.<a name=273:2></a> It was then covered with a covering of badgers' skins, and finally with a cloth wholly of blue.<a name=273:3></a> Thus covered it was carried.<a name=273:4></a> What I am seeking to point out is that the ark of the testimony is presented as hidden from view, and only to be apprehended by those who take up the exercise of going into the holiest, for only in the holiest could it be seen.<a name=273:5></a> That is important, because it is as we seek the presence of God that we gain some impression of Christ as the ark of the testimony: that is to say, it is not something that is open to public gaze; it is not something presented, so to speak, in the initial testimony of the gospel, but it is something which is to be cherished, and cherished by God's people, for while in the old dispensation only the High Priest had access to the holiest and that but once a year, in Christianity the way into the holiest has been made open to us, and we are encouraged and exhorted in Hebrews to draw near and to enter the holiest.<a name=273:6></a> It is contemplated that we will make a practice of withdrawing into the presence of God, not for the purpose of making our requests known in relation to our own needs, not indeed necessarily for the purpose of praying at all, for the holiest itself is not connected with the thought of prayer, nor
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=274>[Page 274]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		necessarily exactly connected with the thought of worship, though that would result, but more to contemplate what Jesus is and has established in the presence of God.<a name=274:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So I read <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#40:6">Psalm  40:6</a>, 7, 8 because the Lord in Spirit is presented as saying, "Sacrifice and oblation thou didst not desire: ears hast thou prepared me.<a name=274:2></a> Burnt-offering and sin-offering hast thou not demanded; Then said I, Behold, I come, in the volume of the book it is written of me -- To do thy good pleasure, my God, is my delight, and thy law is within my heart.<a name=274:3></a>" That gives us a clue to the idea of the ark of the testimony.<a name=274:4></a> It is Christ as having come into manhood with a view to establishing all that is in the will of God, and establishing it as cherishing it, as having it in His heart; not merely coming, so to speak, officially to do something as commanded to do it, but coming in as loving God's will and devoting Himself to it.<a name=274:5></a> So we read that the ark was to be made of acacia wood; that is a particularly indestructible kind of wood capable of much endurance, signifying, I believe, the distinctive and holy character, the incorruptible character of manhood in which Jesus was found as having become Man; an order of manhood proved in the temptation in the wilderness to be wholly incorruptible, and therefore wholly capable of going through an evil world maintaining all that was due to God, and in no way deflected or corrupted by it.<a name=274:6></a> We, as having through redemption received the Holy Spirit, are capable of being formed after the same order of manhood; indeed, in the Spirit, we partake in it, and as, appreciating Christ and abiding in Christ, we may take character from it, so that we ourselves become incorruptible, as it says in John's epistle, "We know that every one begotten of God does not sin, but he that has been begotten of God keeps himself, and the wicked one does not touch him," <a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:18">1 John  5:18</a>.<a name=274:7></a> It

		is a kind of answer in the saints to what the Lord said of Himself in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:30">John  14:30</a>, "The ruler of the world comes and in me he has nothing.<a name=275:1></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When Christ came into this world He came in as cherishing all that was in the mind and heart of God to establish.<a name=275:2></a> He was going to carry it through and establish it whatever Satan or man might do, and the Lord carried through in triumph every item that was in the will of God.<a name=275:3></a> He surrendered nothing.<a name=275:4></a> In John's gospel, we hear Him saying, "My food is that I should do the will of him that has sent me and that I should finish his work," <a href="../bible/John.htm#4:34">John  4:34</a>.<a name=275:5></a> Then again at the close we hear Him saying, "<i>I</i> have glorified <i>thee</i> on the earth, I have completed the work which thou gavest <i>me</i> that I should do it," <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:4">John  17:4</a>, showing that He had carried it through.<a name=275:6></a> What He had cherished in His heart He had completed.<a name=275:7></a> Not a single item of the will of God was left uncompleted.<a name=275:8></a> He went into death in order to establish the will of God for ever.<a name=275:9></a> In His death a basis was laid upon which God could effectuate His thoughts in mercy.<a name=275:10></a> So we find that upon the ark of the testimony was placed the mercy seat, and from that standpoint God would speak with Moses and communicate His mind to His people.<a name=275:11></a> Moreover, in the ark was to be placed the "testimony that I shall give thee.<a name=275:12></a>" It is once mentioned before the mercy seat is introduced and after the mercy seat is introduced it is mentioned again; it is set in the ark, "the testimony that I shall give thee.<a name=275:13></a>" I believe the bearing of that is that in answer to all that Satan brought into this world in introducing into God's creation a will contrary to God's will.<a name=275:14></a> God has first of all brought in in Christ One who loved His will and was governed wholly by it, and came in for the express purpose of effecting it, and then on the ground of mercy based in righteousness on His death.<a name=275:15></a> God is securing men of Christ's order,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=276>[Page 276]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		who likewise are governed by delighting in God's will, and are regulated by no other.<a name=276:1></a> That means in the full result that we see in Christ in God's presence the pledge of the bringing in and establishing of another world where the will of man in opposition to God is entirely set aside; a world composed of those who take character from Christ, and delight in God's will, so it is a world in which God can dwell complacently.<a name=276:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the testimony in regard of Christ now, as we have it in Ephesians is "He that descended is the same who has also ascended up above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.<a name=276:3></a>" He has already gone up far above all heavens with a view to filling all things.<a name=276:4></a> There is nothing more striking than that.<a name=276:5></a> I urge the brethren to contemplate it that there is a Man now in the presence of God who is going to fill all things.<a name=276:6></a> Let the power of it sink into our hearts, that the day is near when there will be no longer room for anything that does not take character from Christ.<a name=276:7></a> What a day for God!<a name=276:8></a> The day of Christ in contrast to this present scene and all that marks it; a day when the whole universe will be filled with what takes character from Christ, and the greatest influence to bring that to pass will be the assembly, His fulness, the fulness of Him that filleth all in all.<a name=276:9></a> I trust that what I have said will give you some little impression of what the ark of the testimony is.<a name=276:10></a> It is Jesus, known in the truth of His Person, a divine Person become Man, bringing into manhood an order of manhood wholly His own, a wholly incorruptible order of manhood, the great characteristic feature of which is that God's will is delighted in, and God's will is to be established.<a name=276:11></a> Moreover, He is apprehended as having already gone through death and triumphantly risen again and been exalted to the right hand of God, indeed, far above all heavens, and from that point He is going to fill all

	<div class="paragraph">
		things.<a name=277:1></a> That being so, what is the effect of it upon us, dear brethren?<a name=277:2></a> This is an item that we carry in testimony, these things having place in our hearts' affections.<a name=277:3></a> Obviously, one important result is that no other will than God's will, nothing else but what is taking character from Christ, should prevail in the assembly.<a name=277:4></a> The bearing of the assembly at the present time as in testimony here is that it is a sphere where God dwells, and where all things that are going to obtain publicly in the world to come have their answer morally at the present time; hence the more we get the light of this in our souls, the more we shall be regulated by Christ in order to see that conditions in the assembly are, in fact, pleasing to God as governed entirely by His will.<a name=277:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there is another thing, and that is illustrated by Asaph in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#73">Psalm  73</a>.<a name=277:6></a> It has its result in preserving us from becoming affected by influences that otherwise might have a harmful effect upon us in this world.<a name=277:7></a> Asaph was a godly man, but he says, "As for me, my feet were almost gone, my steps had well nigh slipped," the reason for that being as he says, "I was envious at the arrogant, seeing the prosperity of the wicked.<a name=277:8></a> For they have no pangs in their death, and their body is well nourished.<a name=277:9></a> They have not the hardships of mankind, neither are they plagued like other men.<a name=277:10></a>" Then in verse 13 he says, "Truly have I purified my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency: For all the day have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.<a name=277:11></a>" There is a child of God, one of God's people, and he is conscious of what it is to be continually under discipline.<a name=277:12></a> Every one of God's children is in greater or less degree under discipline; not necessarily chastening in a severe form, scourging because of failure on our part, but every parent knows that his children, while they are children, always have to be in greater or less degree under discipline; that is

	<div class="paragraph">
		to say, there is a certain rule, involving sometimes limitations, which has to be maintained in the home for the instruction and preservation and development of the children.<a name=278:1></a> So with God's children, every brother and sister, if he is sensitive, knows that in some way or other he is constantly conscious of God's hand upon him, and necessarily so.<a name=278:2></a> We are conscious of the necessity for it, for we are to become partakers of His holiness.<a name=278:3></a> The more we understand God, the more we realise the necessity for it, but Asaph was feeling that he was plagued all the day long and chastened every morning.<a name=278:4></a> He looked upon the wicked and he saw their prosperity, apparently having no difficulties, and so on.<a name=278:5></a> That was the point of view that Satan was careful to present to Asaph.<a name=278:6></a> So powerful was the effect of this upon him that he said his feet had well nigh slipped until, as he says, "I went into the sanctuaries of God; then understood I their end.<a name=278:7></a>" That was his salvation; he went into the sanctuary of God.<a name=278:8></a> If we resort to the holiest, we shall get an apprehension of Christ in His ability to establish God's will and bring in a world entirely according to Himself for the pleasure of God, and that means we see that this world, whatever conditions are like and however the wicked may seem to prosper for the moment, is bound to come to an end.<a name=278:9></a> You see the utter worthlessness of all that pertains to this world, if you have in your soul the light of One in a dominant position from which He will fill all things.<a name=278:10></a> That means the setting aside for ever of the system of things in which the wicked flourish.<a name=278:11></a> To have Christ in our hearts as the ark of the testimony is more than preservative; it gives us a right judgment as to what this world is morally, and enables us in a satisfied way to be completely apart from it, and wholly given over to the testimony of God to which we have been called.<a name=278:12></a>

		the covenant.<a name=279:1></a> The ark of the testimony, as I see it, is the One who enshrines a testimony which God is giving and which the saints are carrying, that a day is near when God's will will be established publicly.<a name=279:2></a> The ark of the covenant is the one who enshrines and gives effect to all God's thoughts of love concerning His people, and it is a very great thing to appreciate Christ in that light also, as the One who is powerful to make good every thought of love and blessing which God has formed regarding His people.<a name=279:3></a> I have read the three passages, in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#10">Numbers  10</a>, <a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#3">Joshua  3</a>and <a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#8">1 Kings  8</a>, because they present the ark of the covenant in three positions.<a name=279:4></a> In Numbers we have Him as coming into view when the people of God first set out upon their first journey in the wilderness as committed to His testimony.<a name=279:5></a> In the second we have Him as the ark of the covenant as setting aside the power of Jordan so that God's people might pass over into their inheritance.<a name=279:6></a> In the third passage He is brought into His final resting place and the glory of God fills the scene.<a name=279:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#10">Numbers  10</a>it is when the people were about to set out on their first journey as committed to the testimony.<a name=279:8></a> It says, "They set forward from the mountain of Jehovah and went three days' journey; and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah went before them in the three days' journey, to search out a resting-place for them.<a name=279:9></a>" Notice what is said, because often you hear it quoted that the ark of the covenant went three days' journey before the people.<a name=279:10></a> That is not what is said.<a name=279:11></a> What is said is, that <i>they</i> went three days' journey, and the ark of the covenant went before them in the three days' journey; that is, the three days' journey is their journey, only the ark goes before them in it to search out a resting place for them.<a name=279:12></a> I believe what is intended to be conveyed in this is, that we may well afford to commit ourselves thoroughly to the testimony of God in the

		wilderness whatever it entails, because the Lord Himself, in His love for us, will undertake everything that has to be encountered in relation to it.<a name=280:1></a> The three days' journey would be a full experience of what it meant to be in the wilderness committed to God's testimony.<a name=280:2></a> Two days would be a witness to it, but three days' journey would be the full experience of it, a complete testimony to what it meant to be in the wilderness as identified with God's testimony.<a name=280:3></a> It would mean testing, and rigour, and encountering enemies; it would mean all that, but then there is what the ark does entirely of itself: it moved out of its ordinary place in the midst of God's people in their journeying; it leaves that place and takes a place in front of them and goes before them to search out a resting-place for them, and to meet every enemy that had to be met, a most touching thing.<a name=280:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So we read in John's gospel, chapter 3, "Jesus, knowing that his hour had come that he should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, loved them to the end.<a name=280:5></a>" That is the Lord taking account of the fact that His own were now to be left in this world in His absence.<a name=280:6></a> That would constitute the world a wilderness, and they were to be left in the wilderness entrusted with God's testimony, and having that in mind, and knowing full well what the world was, the Lord set Himself to love His own right through to the end.<a name=280:7></a> That is most encouraging.<a name=280:8></a> Before we commit ourselves to God's testimony in this world, there is one thing we may be assured of, and that is, that the love of Christ will see His people right through everything; whatever has to be encountered.<a name=280:9></a> He will encounter it; that is what the Lord would assure us of, and that is what this movement of the ark conveys.<a name=280:10></a> When they began their journey, as identified with God's interests in this world, the ark

		went before them to search out a resting-place, to make sure that it is not all conflict, but that they should have resting-places, and in searching out a resting-place, to meet the enemy; as it says, "And it came to pass when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, Jehovah, and let thine enemies be scattered; And let them that hate thee flee before thy face.<a name=281:1></a> And when it rested, he said, "Return, Jehovah, unto the myriads of the thousands of Israel.<a name=281:2></a>" This was not the final resting-place that was in mind, the final place was Canaan, but this was a resting-place sought out while they were still in the wilderness, and I believe it has its answer in what the Lord's supper affords to us on the first day of the week, for our position publicly is that we are in the wilderness committed to God's testimony, and passing in it through all the exercises that are connected with it, but we appreciate that the Lord provides a resting place in that position, a place where, for the moment, we may lay aside the exercises connected with the testimony, and enjoy His love and the way His love would serve us, and we enter into that resting place in the sense of His complete victory over every enemy that has challenged His way.<a name=281:3></a> So the ark of the covenant represents in that way Christ as great enough to give expression and effect to all that is in the heart of God in regard to His people.<a name=281:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This, in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#10">Numbers  10</a>, is only a provisional resting place while we are in the wilderness, but the great thought of God is that we should pass over into our inheritance, and finally that we should constitute His inheritance.<a name=281:5></a> Joshua presents to us our inheritance, while that which is arrived at under David and Solomon, in finality, represents God's inheritance in the saints.<a name=281:6></a> So in the book of Joshua we have the ark presented to us again as the ark of the covenant, and it is presented as moving into Jordan, and it says,

		"When they that bore the ark were come to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests who bore the ark dipped in the edge of the water (and the Jordan is full over all its banks throughout the days of harvest), the waters which flowed down from above stood and rose up in a heap, very far, by Adam, the city that is beside Zaretan; and those that flowed down towards the sea of the plain, the salt sea, were completely cut off.<a name=282:1></a> And the people went over opposite to Jericho.<a name=282:2></a>" This presents to us Christ as entering in irresistible power into death in all that death meant, in order to break its power and make a way through, so that God's people should be able to pass over into the inheritance which God's love had provided for them.<a name=282:3></a> It has been well said that the ark in Jordan is not so much expressive of the love of Christ, though, of course, love is there, but it is particularly expressive of power, the power that disposed of death.<a name=282:4></a> It says in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#78:61">Psalm  78:61</a>, "And gave his strength into captivity, and his glory into the hand of the oppressor"; that refers to the ark.<a name=282:5></a> Christ is the power and the glory of God, and that was seen particularly as He entered into death, for when the Lord Jesus went into death, all that was involved in death as the judgment of God and the power of Satan, all was concentrated there.<a name=282:6></a> "The Jordan is full over all its banks throughout the days of harvest.<a name=282:7></a>" It was overwhelming to anything else but the ark, but the ark moves into it, and as the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the edge of the water the waters went back, and the waters that flowed down toward the sea failed, and the people passed over; so no water was seen and the victory was complete, and that is exactly what we have in the light of Christ's death and resurrection.<a name=282:8></a> It is true that it says here in verse 17 that the ark remained in the midst of Jordan until all the people had passed over, but that is rather to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The completeness of the victory which Christ has accomplished over death is to enter into our souls.<a name=283:3></a> We are to contemplate it, because what He has done has been in view of us.<a name=283:4></a> God having marked us out for an order of life and blessing which stands related to Christ beyond death; therefore, if we see Christ going into death as the power of God to dispose of death and overthrow it, and rising triumphantly out of death, we understand that He is setting out what is in God's mind for us.<a name=283:5></a> It says in Colossians, chapter 2, "Ye have been also raised with him through faith of the working of God who raised him from among the dead.<a name=283:6></a>" When we come together in assembly, and our hearts are freshly touched by means of the Lord's supper, and He comes in in response to the affectionate desires of His own.<a name=283:7></a> He is able to present Himself as for ever beyond the power of death.<a name=283:8></a> That is an actuality.<a name=283:9></a> We are not yet actually risen but Christ is.<a name=283:10></a> The position is actually held by Christ, and faith apprehends that what has actually come to pass in Christ is God's mind for us, so faith enters into it.<a name=283:11></a> Just as the people had to keep their eyes on the ark and to move, their movements being determined by the movements that they discerned in the ark, so we keep our eyes on Christ; not exactly Christ in death, but Christ as out of it, because the standing of the ark in Jordan until the people were passed over was to demonstrate the completeness of the victory, and that for us is seen in the position Christ has as risen from among the dead.<a name=283:12></a> So, not only is there faith in the operation of God who raised Him from the dead, but also, quickening comes in; there is power in our souls, as our affections are quickened in relation to Christ where

		We were speaking together this afternoon, dear brethren, of the thought of building as connected with the saints, and I wish this evening to speak of God as builder, and to seek to show something of the stability and glory of what He builds, so that we may be stable, and that, in any little measure in which we may be able to have part in furthering divine interests, we may be working with God; that is, working intelligently.<a name=287:1></a> We read of Jonathan that he wrought with God, which is a very important matter, because there is much energy and labour in Christendom that is misdirected and misplaced simply because saints are not in the intelligence of what God is doing, and therefore they work according to their own ideas, instead of having their ideas and aims regulated by the light of what God is working for.<a name=287:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first reference to building in the Scriptures, is in the second chapter of Genesis, the passage I have read, where the word which is rendered 'made,' "the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made he a woman," is actually <i>builded</i>; He builded a woman.<a name=287:3></a> We were speaking this afternoon of the edifying of the body of Christ.<a name=287:4></a> Edifying is, of course, the thought of building, and building involves a constructive process.<a name=287:5></a> It is not like creation which is done in a moment, but it is done stage by stage and done systematically, and done, if one may say so, according to plan, and so we find that God was the first builder.<a name=287:6></a> Afterwards we shall find, in chapter 11, that man began to build, and he has been building up a world of his own for his own pleasure and his own glory ever since; but the One who inaugurated building was God Himself.<a name=287:7></a>

		It is well that we should see in what setting this building of the woman comes.<a name=288:1></a> Adam, as we know, is a type of Him who was to come, and the antitype is seen in our Lord Jesus Christ, and the present view that we have by the Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ is, as we have it in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>, that God has set Him at His own right hand in heavenly glory, "far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, .<a name=288:2></a>.<a name=288:3></a>.<a name=288:4></a> and hath put all things under his feet.<a name=288:5></a>" That is the position which faith recognises.<a name=288:6></a> It is not known in the world, but it is known by the people of God.<a name=288:7></a> It is the position in which Christ has been placed by God; as it says elsewhere, we do not yet see all things put under Him, but faith apprehends that God has already put Him in that position and has put all things under His feet.<a name=288:8></a> God has determined that, and is therefore entitled to regard it as done.<a name=288:9></a> Now that answers very much to the position in which Adam is seen in this second chapter of Genesis.<a name=288:10></a> He is presented to us placed as head of the whole system that God had brought into existence on the earth.<a name=288:11></a> God not only created the earth, but He also brought into existence a world upon the earth, a world of life, a world of great variety of life, a world composed of many different characters of creatures, some of them having their existence on the earth, some of them constituted to have their existence in the heavens, the birds of the air, showing that God delights in great variety and delights in different spheres of life and blessing.<a name=288:12></a> All that was intended to foreshadow typically the system of blessing which God has in mind to establish in the world to come, consisting as we know of various families, some earthly, some heavenly, as it says in the epistle to the Ephesians, "the Father, of whom every family in the heavens and on earth is named.<a name=288:13></a>" So there

	<div class="paragraph">
		As I was saying, every creature expresses some feature of divine glory and Adam's intelligence is seen in that he was able to give names to them all.<a name=289:16></a> But then, in that position, God said it was not meet that the man should be alone.<a name=289:17></a> <i>He</i> would make him an helpmeet for him.<a name=289:18></a> It is just here that this first thought of building comes in, and the idea of the building of the woman involves a process, not an act of creation, but a process.<a name=289:19></a> It is what is going on at the present time by means of the work of the ministry.<a name=289:20></a> It says that He caused Adam to fall into a deep sleep and he slept.<a name=289:21></a> It is, of course, typical of Christ in death; not that Christ is still in death, of course, actually, but I suppose publicly the position is that this is the time of His death.<a name=289:22></a> That is to say,

		Now God is building a counterpart to Christ.<a name=290:5></a> The conception is marvellous, for the body of Christ is composed of all those who receive the Holy Spirit, from the day of Pentecost right on to the time of the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ for His saints.<a name=290:6></a> Hence the body is an immense vessel, and the wisdom of God enters into the formation of this vessel in which Christ is to be perfectly expressed, and the process is going on.<a name=290:7></a> The work of the ministry is going on.<a name=290:8></a> We are to grow, as it says, "we may grow up to him in all things.<a name=290:9></a>" Faithful ministry keeps Christ continually before the hearts of the saints, and will not allow any other ideal but Christ, and will not allow any other man but Christ, and the power by which God works in the souls of the saints, is that they are affected by the influence of the love of Christ.<a name=290:10></a> He descended first into the lower parts of the earth; not only into death, but into the grave.<a name=290:11></a> He has gone right beneath, so to speak, all that lay upon us, in order that He might establish an indisputable claim to have us in life, that we might be brought into what has been from the beginning in God's mind for us.<a name=290:12></a> And so we are to be formed

		And so, it has often been said that the deep sleep of Adam does not typify the death of Christ in relation to any issues that were raised by the incoming of sin, because it took place before sin had come into the world, and that is perfectly true.<a name=292:3></a> Thus it does not contemplate the death of Christ in relation to setting us free from our sins or anything of that sort, but at the same time we have to be formed in holiness and righteousness and love, because a merely innocent being would not in any way satisfy the heart of Christ or be a true counterpart to Him.<a name=292:4></a> The counterpart of Christ must be characterised by holiness and righteousness and fashioned above all in love, and in intelligence too.<a name=292:5></a> And so the divine conception is marvellous, dear brethren, that while other families doubtless will bear some impress of divine glory as the creatures in the physical creation did, the assembly is to be the fulness of Christ, and Christ is the fulness of God.<a name=292:6></a> "In whom all the fulness of the Godhead dwells bodily.<a name=292:7></a>" God has come into perfect expression in the Man Christ Jesus, and that Man is to have a body in which His fulness as Man can find perfect expression.<a name=292:8></a> God has first come out in the Mediator, the Man Christ Jesus, a divine Person become man, and that glorious Man has a vessel which is in turn His fulness, so that what God is as known in the creation perfectly expressed in Christ, is to be expanded, not added to, but diffused, so that the whole redeemed creation, heavenly and earthly families, shall be in the light of God made known in Christ, that light diffused by means of the assembly, His body.<a name=292:9></a>

		In <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#11">Genesis  11</a>we have the thought of man combining to build.<a name=294:1></a> We read of building by man as early as Cain, that he builded a city and called it after the name of his son Enoch, so that the idea of building, which was originated by God Himself, was quickly taken up by man, by man away from God, by unregenerate man, and was taken on as a means by which he would perpetuate his own name.<a name=294:2></a> He called the city after his son Enoch.<a name=294:3></a> In chapter 11 we find a further feature in connection with man's building, and that is, that they were uniting to do it, combining to do it.<a name=294:4></a> It says that the whole earth was of one language and of one speech, "And they said to one another, Go to, let us make brick and burn them thoroughly.<a name=294:5></a> And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar.<a name=294:6></a> And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.<a name=294:7></a>" That is morally a picture of what man has been doing ever since.<a name=294:8></a> I believe that it is the first occasion on which we have men presented as combining together.<a name=294:9></a> Combinations of men are a feature of the present time and a sinister feature too, so far as the saints are concerned, because it involves that there is great concentration of power in the hands of the combinations of men and Satan understands that, and however logical and reasonable from man's standpoint, men's combinations may seem to be, they serve in the hands of Satan to provide a powerful means of opposition to what is of God, because men's combinations do not take God into account, nor His will, nor His name.<a name=294:10></a> They have in mind only the improvement and establishment of their own world, their own will, their own glory.<a name=294:11></a> Hence it comes about that those who seek to be true to the Lord find themselves opposed by the combinations of men in various forms at the present time.<a name=294:12></a> The principles

		governing Christians are entirely different from the principles governing men in the world.<a name=295:1></a> Christians are governed, or should be, by the will of God, and seek the glory of God.<a name=295:2></a> Men are governed by their own will and seek their own glory, and hence the Christian, as seeking to be faithful to the Lord and pleasing to God, holds himself aloof from entering into any association with ungodly men.<a name=295:3></a> There is no affinity between them, no fellowship of light with darkness.<a name=295:4></a> At the very beginning God called the light day and the darkness night.<a name=295:5></a> He stamped each with its own true moral character.<a name=295:6></a> He separated the light from the darkness, and that is a principle with God that is to be maintained by those who would be pleasing to God.<a name=295:7></a> There can be no affinity, no fellowship between light and darkness, and therefore, Christians seeking to be pleasing to the Lord find themselves unable to have part in these various combinations of men, and the position is becoming testing.<a name=295:8></a> Satan is behind the matter, seeking to make it impossible for those who would be governed by the truth to go on.<a name=295:9></a> But then the comfort of this scripture is that God overlooks nothing.<a name=295:10></a> He comes down to see what men are doing.<a name=295:11></a> He says, 'If I do not hinder them, there will be no limit to what they will do.<a name=295:12></a>' So He hinders them and confuses their language.<a name=295:13></a> And this is a matter, dear brethren, at the present time of the greatest importance, but if we are prepared to be faithful and to suffer rather than surrender the truth, we can count upon God to weaken the combinations of men in favour of the saints.<a name=295:14></a> I do not say that He will not still allow them a large measure of strength, but He will not allow them to go the full length.<a name=295:15></a> He did not allow these men to go the full length, but he confounded their language.<a name=295:16></a> That is often the way God takes to weaken men's movements.<a name=295:17></a> They are no longer able to see eye to eye, they begin to speak different languages,

		Now in contrast with all that, it says of Abraham, who, it must be borne in mind, is the father of us all; that is, we are to learn from our father Abraham, that he removed his tent and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre which is in Hebron, and built there an altar to the Lord.<a name=296:4></a> Now Hebron is always typical in Scripture of the purpose of God.<a name=296:5></a> We read in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#13">Numbers  13</a>that Hebron had been built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.<a name=296:6></a> Zoan, I understand, was a seat of learning, representing the wisdom of this world, but there is that which is before the wisdom of this world.<a name=296:7></a> God's purpose was entirely before it.<a name=296:8></a> Whatever men may be doing in their ability, with Satan behind them, building up their own world according to their own thoughts, there is that which was before it and that is the purpose of God, and the purpose of God is going through.<a name=296:9></a> The first one to build was God Himself, and He is going steadily on with His building.<a name=296:10></a> What man is doing does not affect what God is doing, save that under God's hand it all works out to further His work.<a name=296:11></a> The more saints are under the influence of Christ, the more they will be concerned to be faithful to God.<a name=296:12></a> He was faithful to God.<a name=296:13></a> He would die rather than surrender what was due to God, and the very presence of difficult conditions that seem to threaten those who desire to go on with the truth, is only an occasion for God to develop in the saints that feature according to Christ, that they will be faithful to God at all costs and maintain the truth of God.<a name=296:14></a> Only in that

		This is a most important matter for those of us who are older, for if we would see (as every one who is in any way with God would desire to see) the younger generation go on and maintain the truth in a living way, it is essential that we should be concerned as to having moral power to exemplify the truth ourselves.<a name=298:1></a> That is exactly what Abraham did, in moral power.<a name=298:2></a> It is a question, dear brethren, not of what we say, but of what our outlook is as shown by what we do.<a name=298:3></a> If I am seeking a place for myself in this world, I show clearly that I have not in my soul the light of a city that has foundations, whose builder and maker is God.<a name=298:4></a> We are here for the testimony and the pleasure of God.<a name=298:5></a> The question of earning our living and maintaining righteousness and having wherewith to give, will all enter into it and if we are with God.<a name=298:6></a> God will see to it that we do find a way to meet every righteous obligation and have something over to give, coming out like God, as it says in Ephesians, "Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.<a name=298:7></a>" It is a question of fulfilling righteousness, and having something also by means of which we may come out like God, as a giver.<a name=298:8></a> That is why Christians are here.<a name=298:9></a> They are not here to make a name for themselves or a comfortable home for themselves in a scene in which Christ is not.<a name=298:10></a> It is a question of having what is necessary and of going on with the testimony and truth of God.<a name=298:11></a> So Abraham dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob the heirs with him of the same promise.<a name=298:12></a> You know how Isaac had a brother Ishmael, but he was not affected by his father's faith.<a name=298:13></a> He, alas, was affected by his mother.<a name=298:14></a> It says that he dwelt in the wilderness and became an archer and his mother took him a wife from the land of Egypt, so that he did not continue in the faith of his father Abraham, not very

		UNRIGHTEOUSNESS AND UNBELIEF AS HINDERING THE SAINTS
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two things, dear brethren, which often tend to hinder the saints from entering into the enjoyment of their proper portion, and one is the failure rightly to judge some practical unrighteousness, resulting in a lack of nearness to Christ and a certain uneasiness in the presence of the Lord, and the other is unbelief, or unreadiness to avail oneself of the service of the Spirit of God to make the things that are connected with Christ where He is a present reality to us.<a name=304:1></a> Now, I believe these two things are illustrated on the one hand, in the history of Joseph's brethren in the latter part of the book of Genesis, and on the other hand, in the history of Jacob in that part of the book, and the New Testament Scriptures which will help in relation to these two matters are in 2 Corinthians in connection with Joseph's brethren, and in Colossians in relation to Jacob.<a name=304:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We well know, of course, that Joseph is one of the outstanding types of Christ in the Old Testament.<a name=304:3></a> He is presented as the beloved son of his father, his father loved him above all his brethren, and made him a coat of many colours, and the very fact that his father so distinguished him, aroused jealousy in the hearts of ten of his brethren.<a name=304:4></a> We know what the sequel was, that they sold him into Egypt as a bond-slave for twenty pieces of silver, having previously proposed first of all to slay him, and having cast him into a pit, but as the scripture says, there was no water in the pit.<a name=304:5></a> That is to remind us that while he had to go into the pit in order to typify the Lord Jesus Christ as going into death, yet in fact, only the Lord Jesus personally could enter into death
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		in all that it really involved and hence there was no water in the pit in which Joseph was placed.<a name=305:1></a> In due time Joseph was brought up out of prison and exalted to the highest place in the land of Egypt under Pharaoh and became the great administrator of food.<a name=305:2></a> There was no food, in the ordering of God, anywhere to be had, save in the land of Egypt under the administration of Joseph, and Joseph's brethren, impelled by the need of food, came down to Egypt to buy corn, and Joseph immediately comes into view as labouring with remarkable skill and patience and feeling, with a view to bringing his brethren, whom he recognised though they did not recognise him, into right and happy relations with himself.<a name=305:3></a> One cannot go into all the detail of chapters 42 to 44, preceding chapter 45, but the history is well known.<a name=305:4></a> When Joseph saw his brethren, he spoke to them roughly and put all ten of them, for Benjamin did not come, in custody for three days, and then released them, but bound Simeon before their eyes and placed him in prison and sent the rest home with food and with their money returned in the mouths of their sacks.<a name=305:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now let us bear in mind that in all this, Joseph is typical of the Lord Jesus in the way that He acts in discipline with regard to any one of us who is not at ease with Himself.<a name=305:6></a> There are many things that operate to hinder those who are truly saints, truly brethren of Christ, from being at ease in the presence of the Lord, and one of the things that is most effective in preventing us from being at ease in His presence is some past unrighteousness of walk or conduct that has not been properly judged.<a name=305:7></a> Thus it was in the case of Joseph's brethren, and Joseph understood perfectly, as representing God, that there could be no disclosure of his own thoughts and feelings towards them, and no bringing them into restful conditions in the enjoyment of his

		presence, while certain moral questions remained unsolved, and the whole point in Joseph's dealings with his brethren was to bring them to a right judgment of what had marked them in their attitude and conduct toward him.<a name=306:1></a> Let us remember, dear brethren, that in the death and resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ, God has signified His disapproval of the first man and His approval, in an unqualified way, of Jesus.<a name=306:2></a> His action in giving up Christ and allowing Him to be put to death by wicked men, was the exposure, in the action of wicked men, of what the first man is capable of, his heart fully exposed in the presence of perfect goodness in Jesus, so that the first man is exposed as utterly and irreparably opposed to God, and opposed to Christ.<a name=306:3></a> In the death of Christ, God indicated that the first man must be brought to an end in death; only in grace, that was effected vicariously in the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ, in order that all those who are prepared to obey the gospel, might be brought into life and blessing in Christ in the Man in whom God does delight.<a name=306:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in the dreams that Joseph had, there was clear indication that God intended that Joseph should be supreme, and it was that that stirred up, in addition to the fact that Jacob his father showed him preference, the jealousy and hatred of his brethren, and likewise with us every working of our own flesh and our own wills, is really hostility to Christ.<a name=306:5></a> It is really that the flesh in us resents being set aside, resents what God has already given testimony to in the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus, that the first man must go and that Christ only must be exalted, One who always delighted in the will of God, and afforded unfailing pleasure to the heart of God in every detail of His path here, and is now established in the presence of God for His abiding pleasure.<a name=306:6></a> Hence the jealousy of Joseph's

		Joseph was dealing in wonderful skill with his brethren, and <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#45">Genesis  45</a>indicates the end to which Joseph was working, "Come near to me, <i>I pray you</i>.<a name=307:2></a>" His heart was in it, and when they did come near to him, he kissed them, and he spoke to them and they to him.<a name=307:3></a> Moreover, he proposed to them that they and their wives and little ones were to come to him and he would maintain them, so that there was nothing in the heart of Joseph for them but perfect blessing in nearness to himself, but conditional on the right moral relations being maintained.<a name=307:4></a> So long as anything contrary to God was being cherished or excused, there could be no enjoyment of nearness to himself.<a name=307:5></a> Hence he adopted measures which seemed severe, but at the same time, if we read the history, we find that his heart was greatly moved, that he turned aside to weep more than once.<a name=307:6></a> This ought to affect us, if we realise how much pain and sorrow we cause to the heart of Christ if we are going on with any kind of unrighteousness.<a name=307:7></a> It brings in distance from Himself and the Lord feels it.<a name=307:8></a> It is not His desire, so here Joseph moves in remarkable skill, combining severity with remarkable grace, for he not only gave them the food that they needed, but returned their money in their sacks.<a name=307:9></a> We have to be established in grace, or the Lord will never effect anything with us.<a name=307:10></a> It is a great thing to be established in grace, and Joseph, in his dealings with his brethren, maintained that principle that everything that they received must be on the principle of pure grace, and therefore their money was returned to them in the mouth of their sacks.<a name=307:11></a>

		But then he said that they would not see his face unless they brought their youngest brother with them.<a name=308:1></a> Now the youngest brother was Benjamin, and of the ten brothers who up till then had come down to Joseph, six were sons of Leah, two sons of Bilhah and two were sons of Zilpah.<a name=308:2></a> Joseph was a son of Rachel and Benjamin was a son of Rachel.<a name=308:3></a> All the twelve were sons of the same father, but they were sons of different mothers, and Joseph insisted that their younger brother Benjamin must come down with them next time they came, or they should not see his face.<a name=308:4></a> I believe that Benjamin, as being of the same mother as Joseph, represents a subjective answer to the truth; that is, Joseph is a type of Christ, and Benjamin as born of the same mother as Joseph, represents a subjective correspondence in the saints to Christ, and Joseph in insisting that they should not see his face again unless their younger brother was with them, was raising with them the exercise as to what was befitting in those who were sons of Jacob.<a name=308:5></a> Jacob the patriarch; what is befitting in those who are born of God, so to speak.<a name=308:6></a> That is, we are kindred to Christ, thank God, we <i>are</i> kindred to Christ.<a name=308:7></a> We remember well how the Lord Jesus, on the morning of His resurrection, said to Mary Magdalene, "Go to my brethren, and say to them, I ascend to my father and your Father, and to my God and your God.<a name=308:8></a>" We are brethren of Christ, but what befits those who are brethren of Christ?<a name=308:9></a> In the conduct of the ten brothers there was that which was entirely unbefitting to the brethren of Joseph, and in saying that they should not see his face unless Benjamin was with him, I believe he was, in type, raising exercises with them as to what was befitting to those who were really the brethren of Christ.<a name=308:10></a>

		But then as Joseph sent them back again the next time, he tells his servant to put his silver cup in the sack of the youngest, and then to pursue after them and charge them with stealing his cup, and the servant does that, and they let down their sacks to the ground and opened them out, and the servant searched carefully, beginning at the eldest right down to the youngest.<a name=309:8></a> It is a question now of the Holy Spirit, for the servant is a type of the Spirit of God pursuing His work with us.<a name=309:9></a> Everyone is to let down his sack, what we are carrying, and have it searched diligently, and the Spirit of God would subject every one of us to a searching process.<a name=309:10></a> What for?<a name=309:11></a> What does Joseph's cup represent?<a name=309:12></a> It was that out of which he drank.<a name=309:13></a> It evidently suggests that which is intended to minister pleasure to the heart of Joseph, and I believe he was seeking to bring home to his brethren that in their past conduct what had really marked them was that they had robbed him of his pleasure.<a name=309:14></a> That is, applying it to ourselves, any conduct on our part unworthy of

		I have just indicated all that in order to show what I believe is the moral line of teaching in this part of the history.<a name=311:3></a> Now we come to chapter 45, where it says that Joseph could not refrain himself any longer and he says, "I am Joseph," and "Come near to me, I pray you.<a name=311:4></a>" And they came near.<a name=311:5></a> And he said, "I am Joseph, your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.<a name=311:6></a> Now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither for God did send me before you to preserve life.<a name=311:7></a>" That is to say, that now that they have come to acknowledge the truth and to judge themselves in relation to it, Joseph is assuring them that nothing whatever is lost, but that everything now for their blessing is secured and established in himself.<a name=311:8></a> That is where I link on the passage with the verses in 2 Corinthians.<a name=311:9></a> The apostle Paul found that there were certain at Corinth who were charging him with vacillation, saying one thing at one time and another thing at another, what he describes as yea and nay; that is, his word could not be relied upon.<a name=311:10></a> He passes that over lightly, and says, "For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea.<a name=311:11></a>" He does not admit the charge of vacillation, he explains why it was that he changed his plans and gave some who opposed him occasion to suggest that he was vacillating, but having done that he says, the One whom

		Now I understand that to mean this, that whatever promises of God in the way of blessing for men there have been, and there have been many promises, the fact that man has proved to be a failure, has sinned and come short of the glory of God, has become exposed to His judgment and liable to death, has not in any way thwarted God in carrying through His thoughts of blessing for men.<a name=312:4></a> He has found a resource in the person of His Son, our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=312:5></a> The Son of God has come, and in the coming in of the Son of God, we not only have a glorious Man who is entirely apart from the sinful history of the first man, who has had no part in it, nor could He have part in it, for He is entirely holy and sinless, but He has brought in an entirely new order of manhood.<a name=312:6></a> Although come of a woman, come of David's seed, truly a man, yet He brought in an entirely new order of manhood.<a name=312:7></a> That being so, and He being who He is, He was great enough in Himself, by means of His death, to take up and remove every liability that lay upon men.<a name=312:8></a> All that had come in through sin has been perfectly met in the precious death of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the death and burial of Christ, man himself has been vicariously removed from before the eye of God.<a name=312:9></a> There is one Man in the presence of God in whom there is no failure, in whom God finds pleasure of a most complete kind, and He is One great enough in His Person to communicate His own life as Man to men.<a name=312:10></a> The last Adam, it says, is a quickening Spirit.<a name=312:11></a> How glorious that is!<a name=312:12></a> It is the way by which God effects

		You will notice that it says first of all, in verse 1, "That Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.<a name=320:3></a>" That is, the suggestion is that the Lord wants to be with us.<a name=320:4></a> Indeed He says at the end of Matthew, "<i>I</i> am with you all the days, until the completion of the age.<a name=320:5></a>" That is what the Lord has in mind, completion of the age, this wonderful age which is characterised by God making Himself known to men in grace, and the age is to be completed in a way worthy of God, and with a view to that, the Lord is prepared to be with us, and so Elijah went with Elisha.<a name=320:6></a> But there are certain conditions under which the Lord is with His people, and that we get in one of the chapters in the second book of Chronicles, where a prophet says to king Asa, "The Lord is with you, while ye be with him.<a name=320:7></a>" That is the great point, but if we go off, so to speak, on lines of our own, we cannot expect the Lord to be with us, but He is prepared to be with us if we are exercised to be with Him, and that is what follows in the chapter, that Elijah was testing Elisha as to whether Elisha was prepared to

		The first place they come to is Bethel, the house of God.<a name=322:4></a> The Lord would direct our attention to the house of God, which, Paul says in the epistle to Timothy, is "the assembly of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth.<a name=322:5></a>" The first epistle to Timothy is written especially that we might understand the importance of the house of God.<a name=322:6></a> The house of God is where God dwells, <i>His</i> dwelling place on earth.<a name=322:7></a> We ourselves, all of us, who have received the Spirit of God, are constituted the house of God.<a name=322:8></a> Let every believer understand that, that we are the house of God in virtue of God dwelling among us by the Spirit.<a name=322:9></a> We are not simply the house of God when we are assembled.<a name=322:10></a> We are always the house of God in virtue of the fact that God is dwelling in and among us by the Spirit, and hence it is something always to be borne in mind, that there is that which befits the house of God.<a name=322:11></a> Anyone who has a house expects to be able to have things in his own house suited to his own tastes.<a name=322:12></a> And God expects that His house should be such that those who have to do with it will get right impressions of God from what they see in His house.<a name=322:13></a> If you take notice of the features to be seen in a person's house, you get a fairly good idea of what the person is like to whom the house belongs.<a name=322:14></a> Believers are to bear in mind that there is a certain conduct and order and demeanour that befit those who are constituted God's house.<a name=322:15></a> And so, for instance, Paul in writing to Timothy, says, "I exhort, therefore, that first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men, for kings and all that are in

		authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty, for this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour, who will have all men to be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.<a name=323:1></a>" That is one thing that is to mark the house of God, dear brethren, not simply at the prayer meeting, but also in our homes.<a name=323:2></a> Supplications, prayers, intercessions, giving of thanks continually.<a name=323:3></a> We are to remember kings and all in authority, a most important thing in days when lawlessness is so much on the increase and when government generally is so weak.<a name=323:4></a> I am not speaking in any political sense, or as having any biased view of matters.<a name=323:5></a> Government as such is constituted of God, but in the hands of men tends to be palpably weak.<a name=323:6></a> It is of the utmost importance that the saints of God should continue unceasingly, at home and in the meetings, praying for all men, for kings and all in authority, that government, which is of God, and has in mind the enforcement of what is right and the repression of what is evil and the punishment of evil doers, should be maintained, and the saints go through leading quiet and tranquil lives in all piety and gravity.<a name=323:7></a> And then it goes on the say that men ought to pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands without wrath or reasoning.<a name=323:8></a> What men are to be characterised by in praying everywhere, is lifting up holy hands; that is, that in the recognition that we are having to do with God holy hands are necessary, involving what we put our hands to.<a name=323:9></a> It is intended to raise wholesome exercises as to what we do, so that there may be no hindrance to our filling out the position proper to us as men in God's house.<a name=323:10></a> And then it speaks of women and what is to mark them, their demeanour, their deportment, their dress, all these things are not to take character from the world around, but to be governed by the fact that God is dwelling amongst

		The apostle, in his epistle to Timothy, goes on to emphasise the importance of piety, which should characterise every brother and sister.<a name=324:3></a> It means bringing God into our ordinary circumstances of daily life, and moving in relation to God.<a name=324:4></a> "Great is the mystery of piety, God was manifest in the flesh.<a name=324:5></a>" Think of the wonder of that, beloved brethren, that God Himself should have come down into circumstances of human life in the Person of Jesus, and as having come down into these circumstances, filled them out in a way that glorified God.<a name=324:6></a> Jesus was always marked by dependence on God, was always marked by confidence in God, was always marked by the spirit of thanksgiving.<a name=324:7></a> How that glorified God.<a name=324:8></a> There was never a suggestion in the Lord Jesus of any discontent.<a name=324:9></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16">Psalm  16</a>, the Spirit of Christ says, "the lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places, yea I have a goodly heritage.<a name=324:10></a>" Think of how that glorified God, and what a testimony to God it is as the saints move on quietly, dependently, finding their resource in God and satisfied in the circumstances God has ordered for them, no complaining, discontent, or lawlessness in a world marked increasingly by these things.<a name=324:11></a> What a testimony there is to God as the saints who compose His house are governed practically by piety.<a name=324:12></a> That saves us too, from wanting to become rich.<a name=324:13></a> You see the truth of God touches all these matters.<a name=324:14></a> The epistle to Timothy teaches us that those who desire to be rich fall into temptation and a snare.<a name=324:15></a> See how practical Christianity is, and it is practical because it is concerned with

		Then Elijah moves on.<a name=325:9></a> He says again to Elisha, "Tarry here, I pray thee, for the Lord hath sent me to Jericho.<a name=325:10></a>" And Elisha says, "As the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.<a name=325:11></a>" He is prepared to go to Jericho and to see Jericho from Elijah's point of view.<a name=325:12></a> That is an important matter, dear brethren, to see all these features of the truth from the Lord's point of view.<a name=325:13></a> That is what Elijah had in mind, that Elisha was to be with him in these places, so he goes to Jericho.<a name=325:14></a> Now Jericho, I believe, represents the world as a great system built up by Satan, which seeks to oppose the saints and prevent them from entering into God's thoughts fully.<a name=325:15></a> At the day of Pentecost, it was, for the moment, overthrown in those to whom the testimony came with power, and not only at the day of Pentecost, but in the subsequent ministry of the apostles as they moved from place to place, and the testimony gained a place in the hearts of the saints in power, the world was largely overthrown in the souls of God's

	<div class="paragraph">
		"And of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.<a name=327:3></a>" That, I believe, answers to our going with Elijah to Jericho, that we hold in our souls the same judgment of the world as the Lord has.<a name=327:4></a> I quite agree that at the end of this very chapter there is a certain grace shown to Jericho.<a name=327:5></a> The men of the city come to Elisha and tell him that the situation of the city was pleasant but the water was nought and the ground barren, and Elisha tells them to bring him a new cruse and put salt in it.<a name=327:6></a> "And he went forth to the source of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith Jehovah: I have healed these waters: there shall not be from thence any more death or barrenness.<a name=327:7></a>" I believe that refers to what provisionally took place in this world through the establishment of Christianity, the new cruse being the assembly, a new vessel, and salt being the principle of life, that is, preservation.<a name=327:8></a> It introduced an entirely new influence for God in the world.<a name=327:9></a> God is operating provisionally in grace with the world, and in a sense that continues, but the truth is being rapidly given up.<a name=327:10></a> Eventually the world will prove apostate, so when Elisha went to Bethel, little boys, the rising generation, came out and said to the man of God, "Go up, thou bald-head.<a name=327:11></a>" Think what God would think of that, that little boys should dare to speak to a man of God like that, and that is an illustration of what the rising generation will prove to be, utterly apostate in regard of the testimony of the Spirit of God down here, and that will seal the world's doom; hence we

		And then it says that Elijah said, "Tarry, I pray thee, here, for the Lord hath sent me to Jordan," and Elisha says again, "As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.<a name=328:2></a>" And so they went to Jordan, and what took place there?<a name=328:3></a> Elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smote the waters and they were divided hither and thither; and they two went over on dry ground.<a name=328:4></a>" It is a question, dear brethren, of our apprehending the glory of the Person of Christ, that He could go into death and rise triumphantly out of it, breaking its power, so as to bring to light conditions of life beyond death according to God's purpose for us.<a name=328:5></a> How glorious is the Son of God!<a name=328:6></a> Every other man has had to succumb to death, save in the cases of Enoch and Elijah where God intervened, to show that He had a right to set aside death in favour of man if He pleased, because He knew He would do it in the Lord Jesus.<a name=328:7></a> See the Son of God moving in the power of His own Person into death!<a name=328:8></a> Elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together.<a name=328:9></a> The mantle speaks of the measure of the man, and the glory of the Person of the Son of God was seen as He moved into death and rose triumphantly from the dead.<a name=328:10></a> He was "declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead.<a name=328:11></a>" It was not possible that He should be holden of death, and His resurrection from among the dead has meant the opening up, through death, of conditions of life beyond death, which have been in God's purpose from the outset for us.<a name=328:12></a> Are we going to attempt to continue to find our life and interests in things here, when the Lord Jesus has come forth from God, been into death and risen again in order to open up conditions of life beyond death according to God's purpose?<a name=328:13></a> That is what we are to take account of.<a name=328:14></a> "And it came to pass

		Now, I read the incident in chapter 6 in order to show that we may well afford to commit ourselves to God's testimony and to show the advantage we have in the presence of the Spirit of God here, the Spirit of truth, who, as it says, will guide into all the truth.<a name=332:3></a> It says that the king of Syria warred against Israel.<a name=332:4></a> Israel represents the people of God.<a name=332:5></a> I would just say, in regard of Elijah and Elisha, that their ministry was in Israel; that is, to the ten tribes, not the two tribes, so that they represent the ministry of God really in Christendom, for the ten tribes had departed from God's centre and had become largely idolatrous.<a name=332:6></a> They were still God's people, He had not entirely cast them off, but they had departed from God's centre and become idolatrous, and that is exactly the position of professing Christianity.<a name=332:7></a> Christendom embraces those who are true, but many of God's people are captive to that which characterises Christendom and going on with what is merely formal and in character idolatrous, and yet God in mercy maintains a testimony.<a name=332:8></a> We ourselves, though through grace morally apart from it, are publicly part of it, and we cannot separate ourselves from it.<a name=332:9></a> The ministry of the Spirit amongst us not only has in view the maintenance and development of the truth to those who are available, but it is also a testimony to Christendom, and the presence of the Spirit of God among those who are available to Him, becomes a great barrier against the full development of evil.<a name=332:10></a> So it says that the king of Syria warred against Israel.<a name=332:11></a> Syria was a powerful enemy seeking to overthrow the truth, for the truth was held, if it was held anywhere, among God's people, and the king of Syria became conscious that his plans and

		I have in mind, dear brethren, to say a word as to the purpose for which we are in the world, and as to the means for supporting us in the world according to the will of God.<a name=335:1></a> The verses we read in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>are striking because they show that the presence of Christ here in the world brought to light that there was in man no capacity to appreciate what is of God.<a name=335:2></a> The true light shone, but there was no ability in man to appreciate or respond to it, so that it says that "He was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not.<a name=335:3></a> He came unto his own and his own received him not.<a name=335:4></a>" But then in that condition of things God wrought.<a name=335:5></a> There were certain ones who did receive Him and there are certain ones who have received Him, and that is what I want to call attention to, beloved brethren, that we are here as among those who have received Christ and believed on His name, we are here as the result of the fact that God has wrought, and that we have been born of God.<a name=335:6></a> It says, "as many as received him, to them gave he the right to be children of God .<a name=335:7></a>.<a name=335:8></a>.<a name=335:9></a> who have been born, not of blood"; that is, not according to the natural order of birth, "nor of the will of the flesh," the will of the flesh has had no place in it, "nor of the will of man"; that is, it is entirely of God, sovereignly, "but of God.<a name=335:10></a>" As we take account of ourselves in that light as born of God in the midst of a world which, apart from God's operations, would be entirely unresponsive to Him and incapable of appreciating His things at all, it must, I think, raise exercise with us as to what God has in mind in thus working.<a name=335:11></a> What has He in view for those who are born of Him?<a name=335:12></a> It might be

		said that He has in view for us eternal blessing and glory in accordance with His purpose, and other scriptures would show that that is true, but this scripture does not put it that way.<a name=336:1></a> This scripture says that to those thus born He gave the right to take the place of children of God.<a name=336:2></a> To take that place down here of children of God, and linking that with the passage in the first epistle of John, we read, "Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the children of God.<a name=336:3></a>" (The word is <i>children</i>, not <i>sons</i>.<a name=336:4></a>) Not merely are we entitled to take the place of being His children, but that we should be called such, that we should be known as such.<a name=336:5></a> Evidently what is in view is that the children of God are in this world in testimony.<a name=336:6></a> They are here to represent rightly the One by whom they have been begotten.<a name=336:7></a> I think you can see, dear brethren, as we take account of it, the moral darkness that marks the world, black darkness prevailing everywhere except where God has wrought.<a name=336:8></a> You can see what a privileged position, what a distinctive position, the children of God are in.<a name=336:9></a> They are here now as intended to be a testimony to the true God, the blessed God, a testimony in a world which knows Him not, in order that in His children God might be rightly represented and become known -- especially in the characteristics which John's epistle makes so much of -- namely righteousness, practical righteousness in every detail of life, and love.<a name=336:10></a>

		John in his writings traces things to their source and takes account of two generations -- the generation that is of God, marked by righteousness and love, and the generation that is of the wicked one, marked by lawlessness and hatred, but in this passage in the epistle, the apostle says, "Behold, what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the children of God.<a name=336:11></a>" Not only

		that we should be it, but we should be called it, known as such.<a name=337:1></a> Therefore it says "the world knoweth us not even as it knew him not.<a name=337:2></a>" That is a privileged position, that we become involved in the reproach and rejection of Christ in so far as we are in this world marked by the true features of the children of God.<a name=337:3></a> Not only so, but we have the distinction of continuing the true light as to God; the true light as introduced by Christ is to be continued by the children of God.<a name=337:4></a> It says, "the darkness is passing and the true light now shines.<a name=337:5></a>" It shines among the children of God.<a name=337:6></a> There are doubtless other thoughts connected with children, but this position of testimony is, I believe, the main thought in connection with the children of God, and we may rest assured that in it we shall have the care of God as our Father; as a father He will care for His children, but particularly so as we are, in our intelligence and exercises, filling out the position that is proper to that of the children of God, and understanding that this is a definite matter of God's operation and of His sovereignty, that we are born of God, and that must be with a definite object in mind, and the object in mind is that the truth of God might be maintained livingly in those who are His children, in a world that otherwise knows Him not.<a name=337:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I read the passages in chapters 6 and 10 of the gospel, because I believe they show the lines upon which we may be maintained in this position which God has in mind for us, and while the passage in the first chapter and the passage in John's epistle are largely a question of God or the Father, in chapters 6 and 10 of the gospel we have the Lord brought in.<a name=338:6></a> We have Him, of course, in the chapter in the epistle as the One whom we are to see as He is, but in the passages in chapter 6 and chapter 10 we have the present service of Christ to us, and the whole linked up with His Father's will.<a name=338:7></a> So in chapter 6 the Lord says, "All that the Father giveth me shall come to me.<a name=338:8></a>" It is very touching that what belongs to the Father, what is in His hand, so to speak for the purpose He has in mind, has been given to Christ.<a name=338:9></a>" All that the Father giveth me shall come to me, and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out, for I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me, and this is

	<div class="paragraph">
		the will of him that has sent me, that of all that he has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up in the last day.<a name=339:1></a>" Now I believe the idea in that is that the Lord is undertaking, as part of the Father's will, to see that those whom God has given to Him, those born of God, should be carried through and raised up at the last day.<a name=339:2></a> There is no thought of their being overcome by the influences of darkness that are in the world.<a name=339:3></a> The intention is that they should be carried right through and supported by Christ, as it is the will of God that they should be supported here.<a name=339:4></a> So the Lord says it is the will of Him that sent Him that He should lose nothing.<a name=339:5></a> As He is going to His Father he says "those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition, that the scripture might be fulfilled.<a name=339:6></a>" It was a necessity that one of His disciples should be the son of perdition, and therefore he was not carried through, but save for that one He had lost nothing, and He will lose nothing.<a name=339:7></a> But later on in the chapter we find that while the Lord has set Himself, so to speak, to carry those whom the Father has given Him right through, and to raise them up in the last day, it is on the principle of presenting Himself to us as living bread.<a name=339:8></a> That is to say, our side comes in.<a name=339:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We shall not be maintained in life save as we appropriate the food that is provided for the purpose, and I believe the great thing that is necessary if we are to be in this world according to God is that we should be maintained in eternal life.<a name=339:10></a> Eternal life is, according to John's presentation of it, the means by which we are supported above and kept completely superior to the currents and influences that belong to this world.<a name=339:11></a> Here the Lord in chapter 6 proposes that He Himself should become the food of our souls with a view to our being maintained in eternal life.<a name=339:12></a> I cannot go into it in detail, I only stress it, that

	<div class="paragraph">
		while the Lord says, it is His Father's will, that of all that the Father has given Him He should lose nothing, but should raise it up at the last day, it is on the principle of our appropriating the food that He has provided.<a name=340:1></a> The food is Himself, the living bread come down from heaven for the purpose of being appropriated by His own in their minds and affections.<a name=340:2></a> First in the character of the One who has given His life for us; for He speaks of His flesh and His blood, evidently alluding to His death.<a name=340:3></a> His flesh to be eaten, and His blood to be drunk.<a name=340:4></a> He says, "my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed," and also "whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.<a name=340:5></a>" I believe it is an appeal to our affections, that the Lord Jesus came down from heaven and took up flesh and blood condition, for the express purpose, by means of His death which was vicarious, of closing up that condition of sinful flesh in which we were involved, so that we might partake by the Spirit in His life, in that new condition He has entered beyond death, and hence the Lord goes on to say "He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him.<a name=340:6></a>" He becomes a living object for the affections on the principle of our eating His flesh and drinking His blood, and then appropriating Him as the One who has ascended up where He was before.<a name=340:7></a> Christ is to be our life objectively, and the Spirit our life subjectively.<a name=340:8></a> As He says, it is the Spirit that quickeneth, the flesh profiteth nothing.<a name=340:9></a> It is an individual matter which each of us must take up if we are to be sustained in life, and kept above currents that would otherwise affect us adversely as passing through this world.<a name=340:10></a> We must know what it is to be maintained in attachment to Christ by the Spirit on the principle of eating His flesh and drinking His blood, and then eating Him and living by Him, so

		I have the desire, dear brethren, to speak of what the Lord has at the present time in those who are characteristically overcomers.<a name=343:1></a> You will notice that this passage we have read follows on the last words of David; that is to say, it is suggestive of the end of the dispensation, and the Lord taking account at the end of the dispensation of those upon whom He could rely as faithful to Himself.<a name=343:2></a> These mighty men are not suggestive of gift; they are not suggestive of anything that man would take account of as particularly great.<a name=343:3></a> I think we shall see that they all represent in different aspects simple fidelity to Christ, and therefore, they represent features that can be found marking everyone of us, whether brother or sister, whether older or younger, there is no reason why we should not be marked by fidelity to Christ, and as we are thus marked we shall, I think, find that it is of great value to the Lord.<a name=343:4></a> It says, "These are the names of the mighty men <i>whom David had</i>.<a name=343:5></a>"

		idea; that is, that one is prepared, in fidelity to the Lord and to the truth, to go against the stream in whatever way the stream may affect him, in whatever way he may be in danger of being influenced by it.<a name=345:1></a> An overcomer is one who in faithfulness to the truth and dependence on the Lord is prepared to go against the stream, and so in John's gospel the Lord presents Himself as the great Overcomer.<a name=345:2></a> He says, "In the world ye shall have tribulation, but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.<a name=345:3></a>" He said that triumphantly.<a name=345:4></a> He had passed through the world and every influence that Satan could bring to bear upon Him to divert Him from the path of God's will and testimony had been brought to bear upon Him, but He had passed through as an overcomer, in no respect surrendering anything due to God.<a name=345:5></a> He would die rather than surrender, and so, though outwardly it appeared as though He had been overcome when He was taken by wicked hands and crucified and slain, in actual fact He at that very point was overcoming, for He was there establishing, rather than surrendering, what was in the will of God.<a name=345:6></a> He was there establishing God's will and providing in His own death the basis upon which God would effect all His purposes of glory and blessing, so that overcoming is not to be judged by outward appearance.<a name=345:7></a> It may involve going to the wall so far as outward appearance is concerned, as it says of the Lord Jesus that He was "crucified through weakness.<a name=345:8></a>" That is merely what it appeared outwardly.<a name=345:9></a> There was no weakness in Jesus, I need scarcely say, dear brethren, on the cross or at any other time.<a name=345:10></a> He delivered up His Spirit, crying with a loud voice.<a name=345:11></a> There was not the slightest weakness in the death of the Lord Jesus save as regards the outward appearance of things, but as to that it was said, "he has been crucified in weakness, yet he lives by God's power.<a name=345:12></a>" Therefore, overcoming

	<div class="paragraph">
		In John's epistle he also speaks of overcoming, and says, "Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?<a name=346:4></a>" Then, too, in the book of Revelation we get constant references to overcomers both in church history and also in what will appear and develop in the world after the church is taken from it.<a name=346:5></a> I only mention that, dear brethren, in order that you may see the great importance, in the last days especially, of the overcomer.<a name=346:6></a> As a matter of fact, the truth of God has been maintained ever since sin came into the world on the principle of overcoming, for as soon as sin entered into the world Cain introduced false principles, false ideas contrary to the truth for the moment, and then the issue was raised as to whether the truth was going to be surrendered or whether it was going to be carried forward.<a name=346:7></a> Abel came forward to carry forward the truth; he would not surrender it, he would not give way to the stream that Cain had set in motion, but abode by the truth and he had to suffer for it, he had to die for it, but he was the overcomer.<a name=346:8></a> Abel maintained the truth and God raised up Seth in his place.<a name=346:9></a> Eve saying, "God has appointed me another seed instead of Abel, because Cain has slain him.<a name=346:10></a>" We may rest

		assured of this, dear brethren, that if we on our part are prepared to stand by the truth we shall see that the Lord will carry the truth through, but it is to be carried through on the principle of overcoming, so that although Abel died for the testimony, he overcame in not surrendering to the current which Cain in opposition to the truth had set in motion, and the Spirit of God says of Abel that, "he being dead yet speaketh.<a name=347:1></a>" Indeed, we are speaking of him today.<a name=347:2></a> The Lord is bringing the example of Abel to bear on any here to whom it may be necessary, in order to encourage us, whatever may arise, to stand by the truth, because it is in that way that the truth will go through to completion.<a name=347:3></a>

		Well now, having said that much, I would seek with the Lord's help to speak very briefly in detail of these mighty men.<a name=347:4></a> We shall see, I think, that their might did not consist in that which the world would regard as great, but it is important as having part in God's testimony in this world that we should accustom ourselves to look on things as God sees them and as the Lord regards them and not as the world regards them.<a name=347:5></a> So we come to this one who was chief among the captains and we are given his name, and it says of him that "he lifted up his spear against eight hundred whom he slew at one time.<a name=347:6></a>" That is all the detail given us.<a name=347:7></a> We do not even know who the eight hundred were, whether Philistines, or Amalekites, or what kind of enemy they were.<a name=347:8></a> We are not told.<a name=347:9></a> We are simply told there were eight hundred and this remarkable man slew eight hundred at one time.<a name=347:10></a> You might wonder how he could do it, but then he did it, the power of God was with him.<a name=347:11></a> The point is not so much to occupy us with the detail, but for us to see what the spiritual meaning of it is as applied to ourselves, so that each of us may ask himself or herself.<a name=347:12></a> Why should I not develop mightiness of this kind?<a name=347:13></a> Not

		that it is a question of wanting to be anything; that is, not the question, but of being available to the Lord.<a name=348:1></a> "These are the names of the mighty men whom David <i>had</i>.<a name=348:2></a>" I believe what answers to this chief of the mighty men we may see in Paul, but not in Paul as an apostle, but in Paul who was one who was himself formed by the truth, and therefore it is equally available to everyone of us.<a name=348:3></a> I refer to what he says in Galatians, "I am crucified with Christ.<a name=348:4></a>" I believe this extreme might on the part of the chief of the captains, in the language proper to Christianity, is simply the power that marks one who is characteristically self-judged, because a man or woman who is characteristically self-judged is one upon whom Satan can bring eight hundred influences to bear at one time without effect.<a name=348:5></a> It is there that victory is gained.<a name=348:6></a> It is a question of self being judged, not actions being judged, actions are simply the fruit.<a name=348:7></a> Self is the root, and if the matter is judged at the root; that is, the person capable of the actions is in the Spirit's power and in the light of the cross of Christ, maintained in the place of death, then no suggestion of evil that Satan can bring forward, even though it be eight hundred influences at one time, can overcome that person.<a name=348:8></a>

		Now that, dear brethren, lies at the very root of spiritual power, and I do not believe we shall ever be really effective, really mighty for the Lord, unless we have learned, and maintain in power, that elementary lesson of the true spiritual import of the cross of Christ.<a name=348:9></a> I might ask.<a name=348:10></a> Why was Christ crucified?<a name=348:11></a> It was not simply the act of wicked men.<a name=348:12></a> God was pleased to use wicked men instrumentally by which the crucifixion of Christ was brought to pass, but it was only instrumental.<a name=348:13></a> The crucifixion of Christ was a matter of divine love and wisdom and power, the love of Christ, too, entering into it, so that we

	<div class="paragraph">
		might in the light of it learn to judge our own flesh.<a name=349:1></a> Paul could say, "I am crucified with Christ.<a name=349:2></a>" We learn to judge ourselves in the light of what God has effected in the cross of Christ.<a name=349:3></a> The crucifixion is a very solemn matter.<a name=349:4></a> It is expressive of God's judgment of man in flesh.<a name=349:5></a> Christ took that place for us vicariously in order that that judgment might be expressed and executed, and the cross of Christ in its spiritual import is presented to us in the glad tidings to be received as glad tidings.<a name=349:6></a> God has expressed His judgment on man in flesh as incapable of good; it is of no use expecting anything from him.<a name=349:7></a> God has ended his history judicially at the cross, and He expects that in obedience of faith and in affection for the Son of God who hung upon the cross, we should accept that truth, accept it whole-heartedly.<a name=349:8></a> Paul says, "<i>I</i> am crucified with Christ," but he says, "nevertheless I live, yet not I," but Christ liveth in me"; that is, it is not an unreal thing.<a name=349:9></a> The person who says I am crucified with Christ is in fact actually living, but living now on what principle?<a name=349:10></a> He says, "not I, but Christ liveth in me.<a name=349:11></a>" That is to say, the whole object now of Paul's life was that he himself in his body as a man on earth should be a vessel in which Christ should find expression; and he says, in order to show the power by which that may be sustained practically, "the life which I now live in flesh" (that is, in flesh and blood conditions), "I live by faith, the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.<a name=349:12></a>" I believe Paul had had real transactions with Christ, and had learned from the Son of God what the bearing of the cross of Christ was, in its bearing upon Paul, and he had come to it that no less a person than the Son of God had loved Paul and given Himself for Paul, so that Paul might know the joy of walking in liberty, being entirely free from the dominion of sin and the power of law and

		Well, then, the next one we come to is "Eleazar, the son of Dodo, the son of an Ahohite"; he was one of the three mighty men with David, when they had defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone up.<a name=350:9></a> "He arose and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave to the sword.<a name=350:10></a>" In all the three incidents that follow the one relating to the chief of the captains, it is the Philistines that are in question.<a name=350:11></a> They were the great enemy of David, not that he had no other enemies which he overcame, but the Philistines are the most prominent of David's enemies.<a name=350:12></a> The Philistine is always a menace to us, dear brethren.<a name=350:13></a> The Philistine represents,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You remember what was happening at Corinth, how there was great disunity there, and an effort on the part of certain leaders there to undermine the authority of the apostle and the authority of the truth that he presented.<a name=355:5></a> What did Paul do?<a name=355:6></a> He wrote to them authoritatively, bringing the mind of the Lord to bear upon the situation that existed, but then he did something else.<a name=355:7></a> He sent to them his child Timothy.<a name=355:8></a> It does not say he was to teach, but he would bring to the memory of the Corinthians, I have no doubt it means by his example, Paul's ways as they are in Christ, "as I teach everywhere in every assembly," he says.<a name=355:9></a> I picture to myself the influence that young man would have at Corinth.<a name=355:10></a> There would be the great leaders seeking to make something of themselves, and parties ranged under these different leaders, and then there would be the young man Timothy among them, moving in and out in the spirit of Christ, and as he moved without partisanship, governed by the truth, the Corinthians would begin to say to themselves, 'that is exactly like Paul was.<a name=355:11></a>' They would see for themselves that the Spirit of God was supporting that young man, for the Spirit of God will always support the truth, and it is a question, dear brethren, of what the Spirit of God supports.<a name=355:12></a> That is what we want to go in for, and I believe, in Timothy going among them and in his influence in their midst as bringing to their remembrance Paul's ways as they were in Christ, there was, unknown to the great leaders in Corinth, the undermining

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		of their influence and the re-establishing of what was of God in that place.<a name=356:1></a> And so one has often referred, dear brethren, to the importance of the exemplification of the truth.<a name=356:2></a> You remember when Gideon had to meet the host of the Midianites, it says that he divided his men into three companies of a hundred each and he said to them, "Look on me, and do likewise .<a name=356:3></a>.<a name=356:4></a>.<a name=356:5></a> as I do, so shall ye do.<a name=356:6></a>" And then they were to blow with the trumpets and they said, "The sword of the Lord and of Gideon.<a name=356:7></a>" I believe the sword of the Lord is like Paul's epistle, it is the authority of the Lord, the authoritative word of the Lord that has its own way, but then there is also the sword of Gideon and I believe the sword of Gideon is the power of exemplification, for Gideon said, "Look on me and do likewise.<a name=356:8></a>" So Timothy was to exemplify the truth at Corinth so that they might have brought to their remembrance Paul's ways as they are in Christ, as he says, "as I teach everywhere in every assembly.<a name=356:9></a>" It is important to remember, dear brethren, that every assembly is intended to be patterned after the divine pattern.<a name=356:10></a> There is no reason why there should be features of Christ in one place and not features of Christ in another.<a name=356:11></a> The intention is that every local assembly should be patterned after the divine conception, and so Paul says, "as I teach everywhere in every assembly.<a name=356:12></a>" And so, this third man Shammah represents the important principle of holding the ground in a locality, just standing, standing in the truth in a locality, and the Spirit of God will stand by those who are marked by these features.<a name=356:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Finally, we get the three mighty men who are so often referred to, and now it is a question of considering for the heart of Christ.<a name=356:14></a> I am sure that would appeal to everyone who loves Christ, the possibility of considering for the heart of Christ, the possibility of doing it now.<a name=356:15></a> The opportunity for doing it will

		soon be gone, dear brethren, at least in the way in which we have it now.<a name=357:1></a> The opportunity for considering for what His heart desires while He is still rejected, will soon be gone, and so it is an opportunity not to be missed, and it says, "David longed," showing how his feelings were in it.<a name=357:2></a> "David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me to drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is in the gate.<a name=357:3></a>" The water of the well of Bethlehem.<a name=357:4></a> There is nothing Philistine about that; the water of the well of Bethlehem is what is fresh in the power of the Holy Spirit, what has proper assembly features about it, for Bethlehem is always typical, I believe, of the assembly in its local expression, and so as the Lord is looking down on different assemblies, where He sees us.<a name=357:5></a> He is longing that there should be something of the character of the affectionate response proper to the assembly seen in every place.<a name=357:6></a> That should find expression in our being of one mind and breaking bread in remembrance of the Lord, for the calling of Him to mind, not doing it as a formality, but bringing the affections into it; it is a question of answering to the longings of Christ.<a name=357:7></a> "Water of the well of Bethlehem which is in the gate.<a name=357:8></a>" That is what the Lord wants.<a name=357:9></a> How He must feel the cold formalism in all that is around us in the religious world, what people call divine worship.<a name=357:10></a> How the Lord must feel it!<a name=357:11></a> How he felt it when He went into the house of Simon the Pharisee!<a name=357:12></a> He was invited into the house, outwardly patronised, but inside what was there?<a name=357:13></a> "Thou gavest me not water on my feet, but she has washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with her hair.<a name=357:14></a>" On the other hand, what His heart enjoyed as the woman wept and washed His feet with her tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head, and kissed and anointed His feet!<a name=357:15></a> So it says, "David longed," and these three mighty men broke through the host of the Philistines and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Is there someone here who loves Christ, and who has not yet moved in this way of bringing Him what His heart looks for?<a name=358:2></a> It is a great thing to break through, dear brethren.<a name=358:3></a> These three broke through.<a name=358:4></a> It is an important thing that there should be this element of breaking through too in every locality.<a name=358:5></a> If there is any locality where things appear to be a little dry or formal or stale, there should be exercise that there should be the breaking through of all that, and the bringing in of what is fresh and living in the power of the Spirit of God.<a name=358:6></a> That is what the Lord desires and we should all seek that it should be found among us, the breaking through of everything that is Philistine in character and bringing in what is fresh and living in the energy of the Spirit to satisfy the heart of Christ.<a name=358:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So they brought this to David and it says, "nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto Jehovah.<a name=358:8></a>" That does not mean that he did not appreciate it; he very greatly appreciated it.<a name=358:9></a> When it comes to the antitype we see in one sense the Lord does drink of what is brought to Him.<a name=358:10></a> He does appreciate it fully.<a name=358:11></a> He will first of all have His own portion in it.<a name=358:12></a> Then David poured it out to Jehovah, and that is exactly what the Lord is doing at the present time in the assembly as the saints are found responding to Him and affording Him assembly affection in response to His own heart.<a name=358:13></a> The Lord secures it first for Himself and then He turns it all God-ward, all is gathered up and turned to yield refreshment to the heart of God.<a name=358:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, these things that we have touched upon, dear brethren, are not things that the world would regard as of any consequence at all, but they are very great indeed in the sight of the Lord.<a name=358:15></a> "These are the names of the mighty men whom David had.<a name=358:16></a>"

		It is a question of what the Lord has at the present time, and of the possibility of every one of us here contributing to it, so that there may be more for Him during the little while that remains to us.<a name=359:1></a> The chapter goes on to speak of others, it speaks about a man named Benaiah, a mighty man of valour who performed exploits.<a name=359:2></a> He slew two lion-like men of Moab, and then he slew a lion in a pit on a snowy day, and then he smote an Egyptian, an imposing man who had a spear, and plucked it out of his hand, and slew him with his own spear.<a name=359:3></a> They were great exploits, but remarkably enough these exploits were not so great in the sight of David as the things of which we have been speaking.<a name=359:4></a> It says of Benaiah he was a man of great exploits, but he did not attain to the first three, and so I urge on oneself and on the dear brethren the importance of this element of true self-judgment, maintained in the power of the Spirit, and then of the right application of the Holy Scriptures in the power of the Spirit, and then the standing in one's own locality in the truth, and then moving together to provide Christ with assembly affection, according to His longings.<a name=359:5></a>

		I wish to say a word, dear brethren, as to the greatness of Christianity, in which, by God's grace, we have part, for it is characterised by the fact that the Son of God has come, and then by the fact that consequent upon His having accomplished redemption the Holy Spirit has come.<a name=360:1></a> I hope to be able to indicate something of the greatness of what results from these facts, and then further to show that Christianity is a system of movement, for each of these chapters from which I have read brings in the thought of "following," following the Lord; the Lord walking and the disciples following, which means that there is no such thought as stagnation in Christianity, no thought of being where we were ten years ago.<a name=360:2></a> Any such thought as that is foreign to Christianity.<a name=360:3></a> It is a system, if one may use such a word, characterised by life and movement.<a name=360:4></a> It is important that we should all understand that, because we shall not find satisfaction in the things of God, if we become stagnant, and the way to be preserved from stagnation is to be following, following the Lord.<a name=360:5></a>

		Well now, we have, where we commenced reading, the witness borne by John the baptist; he says, "I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him"; that is, upon Jesus.<a name=360:6></a> We have previously had in this chapter the great fact stated by the Spirit of God, by John the evangelist, "The Word became flesh, and tabernacled among us.<a name=360:7></a>" Prior to that we have the personal greatness of the Word.<a name=360:8></a> It says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.<a name=360:9></a>" These are most absolute statements

		as to the personal greatness of our Lord Jesus Christ who is spoken of as "the Word.<a name=361:1></a>" That He was in the beginning, that He was with God, that He was God, and then it goes on to say, "all things were made by him; and without him was not anything made that was made.<a name=361:2></a>" When we say, He was God, we do not imply, of course, that He has ceased to be God, for Scripture is abundantly clear on that point.<a name=361:3></a> Scripture, speaking of Christ as having become Man, says in the epistle to the Romans, "who is over all, God blessed for ever.<a name=361:4></a>" So these great fundamental facts as to the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ are to be held, and held, livingly, in our souls, because as they are thus held we shall become increasingly impressed with what has come in in virtue of the fact that the Son of God has come.<a name=361:5></a> Think of One who is so great become flesh.<a name=361:6></a> "The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us"; that He who is God should in grace have assumed a condition of flesh and blood so that He might bring amongst men in a way that could be apprehended by them the testimony of what God's thoughts of love and blessing were for them.<a name=361:7></a> It says, "The Word became flesh, and dwelt among us," and the apostle goes on to say, "we have contemplated his glory," and what He speaks of as glory is a glory as of an only-begotten with a father; that is the kind of glory that they apprehended.<a name=361:8></a> It is not exactly what men call glory, but it was moral excellence and beauty that was attractive to the eyes of those in whom God wrought.<a name=361:9></a> They discerned in Jesus a peculiar glory as of an only-begotten with a father, and it was God become man that was setting it out; that is the wonder of it, dear brethren, that God should have come in in that way in Jesus, that what He had in mind for men was that sonship should become available for men, and sonship known affectionately, "an only-begotten with a father.<a name=361:10></a>"

		So John the baptist says, "I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it abode upon him.<a name=362:1></a>" We might have thought it wonderful that one Person of the Godhead should come down to earth in the form of Man, but then the Spirit comes also, descending and identifying Himself in grace with the lowly Man who was there, indicating that if God was prepared to draw near to man in grace in the Person of His Son, the Spirit also was prepared to come in and fill His place in lowly service; He would identify Himself in grace with that lowly Man who was there in the Person of Jesus.<a name=362:2></a> And so He descended from heaven as a dove and abode upon Him.<a name=362:3></a> A dove speaks of that which is most sensitive, and the Holy Spirit took that form and abode upon Jesus in order to convey to us that in the Person of the Lord Jesus there was now here on earth as a Man.<a name=362:4></a> One upon whom God could rest with infinite complacency.<a name=362:5></a> There was not the slightest thing about that perfect Man who was there, the Lord Jesus Christ, that was in any way disturbing to the holiness of God.<a name=362:6></a> The Holy Spirit came down and abode upon Him.<a name=362:7></a> All this is very wonderful, because what it is leading up to is that redemption being accomplished we are to be brought to have part in the life of that Man.<a name=362:8></a> We are to receive by the Holy Spirit of His life, and to be brought into a position of favour and a relationship of affection, in Him.<a name=362:9></a> These are thoughts that divine love has devised and divine love and wisdom have carried into effect, so John the baptist says, "He who sent me to baptize with water, he said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, he it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit," and he says, "I saw and bare record that this is the Son of God.<a name=362:10></a>" The Son of God is, I believe, the title which is intended to convey to us the personal pre-eminence of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=362:11></a> It refers

		to Him in manhood, but it involves the truth of His Person, as to who it is that was there in manhood, and therefore it is intended to arouse attention, as John says in his first epistle, "We know that the Son of God has come, and has given us an understanding that we should know him that is true; and we are in him that is true, in his Son Jesus Christ.<a name=363:1></a>" That is, He apprehended in the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ, One come in to bring in the full revelation of God in the light in which He desired to be known, and to bring in conditions of life beyond death in Himself as Man in which we might be given to have part, so that it can be said, "we know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, in his Son Jesus Christ.<a name=363:2></a>" Now He says, "he it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit.<a name=363:3></a>" That is a wonderful thing.<a name=363:4></a> The Lord could not do that until He had first accomplished redemption, removing by the sacrifice of Himself all that lay upon men, in order that He might have the right to baptise with the Holy Spirit.<a name=363:5></a> I have no doubt that it has the assembly in view, for as to the assembly the apostle says, in the first epistle to the Corinthians, "in the power of one spirit we have all been baptised into one body, .<a name=363:6></a>.<a name=363:7></a>.<a name=363:8></a> and all have been given to drink of one Spirit," <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:13">1 Corinthians  12:13</a>.<a name=363:9></a>

		Now these things coming before us it is evidently contemplated that we should be affected by them and be marked by a desire to enter into what God has in His mind for His people.<a name=365:2></a> So it says, "John stood, and two of his disciples; and looking upon Jesus as he walked.<a name=365:3></a>" They <i>looked</i> upon Jesus as He walked.<a name=365:4></a> Jesus was not standing still, He was walking.<a name=365:5></a> He was conveying, so to speak, that what He had now come to introduce was to be characterised by movement, so looking upon Jesus as He walked, John says, "Behold the Lamb of God.<a name=365:6></a>" What an impression!<a name=365:7></a> Those who were godly in Israel would be accustomed to the thought of the Lamb of God.<a name=365:8></a> They would remember for instance that in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#22">Genesis  22</a>God called Abraham to take his son, his only son Isaac whom he loved and offer him up for a burnt offering.<a name=365:9></a> They would understand how God contemplated that there should be something wholly for Himself, that what had come in by sin was only to become an occasion for the fragrance of Christ in devotion to God's will and glory to come into expression.<a name=365:10></a> They would remember Abraham's word, "My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering.<a name=365:11></a>" Now here was the Lamb of God.<a name=365:12></a> We are intended, dear brethren, to fix our eye upon Christ, the Lamb of God.<a name=365:13></a> Take account of what has come in for God, the very existence of sin and what results from it having become an occasion for the devotedness of Christ to come into expression so that not only has God been glorified in regard of all that

		We must be prepared for movement, because as I said at the beginning, Christianity is a system of movement, there is nothing stagnant about it.<a name=366:5></a> Jesus turned and saw them following; wherever there is any desire to follow the Lord, and the features of the truth He is bringing before us, the Lord takes account of it.<a name=366:6></a> He turned and saw them following and said, "What seek ye?<a name=366:7></a>" He would have us say for ourselves what it is that we desire.<a name=366:8></a> If the Lord were to ask each one of us in this room, What seek ye?<a name=366:9></a> what would we answer?<a name=366:10></a> What do we want to know?<a name=366:11></a> He says to these "What seek ye, and they said, Rabbi, which is being interpreted, Teacher, Where abidest thou?<a name=366:12></a>" You might say, why did they ask that.<a name=366:13></a> There was something about the Lord Jesus that made them ask where He dwelt.<a name=366:14></a> They evidently wanted to see Him at home.<a name=366:15></a> There was something about Jesus that was so attractive that they wanted to see Him in His own sphere.<a name=366:16></a> We want to see Him where He is, entirely as He is in circumstances congenial to Himself.<a name=366:17></a> He says "Come and see.<a name=366:18></a>" How encouraging that we have the Holy Spirit so that we can come and see where Jesus is, where He dwells.<a name=366:19></a> The Spirit of God bears testimony to it.<a name=366:20></a> The Spirit of God says, "who is in the bosom of the Father.<a name=366:21></a>" The bosom of the Father suggests what is receptive and restful, a place of abiding affections.<a name=366:22></a> They say, "Where abidest thou?<a name=366:23></a>" and He says, "Come and see," as though He would say, the same place which I am

	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe "Come and see," is a great word for this present time when there is very little readiness to listen to the word of God, very little interest in the gospel preached, whether it be in the halls, or in the open air, very little ear for it apparently.<a name=367:12></a> It looks as though the spirit of apostasy is rapidly creeping over the whole Christian world and there is very little ear outwardly for the gospel, but if there are any showing interest in these things it is a question of being able to say, Come and see.<a name=367:13></a> So Andrew brings his brother to Jesus and it says, "Jesus beheld him," and said, "Thou art Simon the son of Jona, thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation a stone.<a name=367:14></a>" A stone suggests a building.<a name=367:15></a> What is in mind is, that of a spiritual house in which God, as revealed in Christ, is to be served, and God <i>is</i> to be served.<a name=367:16></a> He has come out in Christ in that way which I have been seeking to set before you with a view to being served in response in the affections which

		I believe the first chapter sets forth these things objectively that we may understand what the mind of God for us is, but now in the remaining passages we have read we get the thought of following with something specific in mind.<a name=369:1></a> The Lord says in chapter 8, "I am the light of the world; he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.<a name=369:2></a>" In John's gospel the Lord constantly presents Himself personally to our hearts.<a name=369:3></a> He says, for instance, in chapter 6, "I am the bread of life," intending that we are to understand that we are to feed upon Christ, and feeding in a spiritual sense is a matter of allowing our minds to engage themselves with Christ, and then the affections will follow.<a name=369:4></a> It is a question of the spiritual affections being nourished, but the spiritual affections will not be nourished if our minds are not rightly directed.<a name=369:5></a> Our minds are to give place to these things, to consider Christ and contemplate Him, to follow Him in His movements, and if we are exercised about these things we shall certainly pray about them.<a name=369:6></a> The first chapter should encourage us to do that.<a name=369:7></a> In this chapter He says, "I am the light of the world; he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.<a name=369:8></a>" In verse 31 He speaks to those who continue in His word, which is the same thing as following Him, for the Lord in His word indicates what is in mind for us.<a name=369:9></a> He does not say the same thing today as He said a week ago, for He would have us in movement.<a name=369:10></a> If He has to say the same thing today as He said a week ago it may indicate that we are stagnant, and it is a serious thing if the Lord has to keep on saying the same thing over and over again.<a name=369:11></a> If we are governed by what He says one time then He will have something different to say to us the next time, so the movements of the Lord Jesus are largely indicated in what He says, what His word is at any given time.<a name=369:12></a>

		The Lord would have every one of us following with the flock.<a name=372:5></a> There is no suggestion of independence or insularity about a flock, and any shepherd will tell you that if a sheep isolates itself from the rest of the flock it is evident that the sheep is sick, so the Lord uses this illustration of a flock moving together as regulated by the Shepherd's voice and affected by the living food He provides.<a name=372:6></a> In chapter 10 the Lord says, "My sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me, and I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.<a name=372:7></a>" It is a question of perishing.<a name=372:8></a> You remember how the children of Israel fell in the wilderness because they were marked by unbelief and disobedience.<a name=372:9></a> The Lord says, "<i>My sheep</i> hear my voice, and they follow me and I give them life eternal.<a name=372:10></a>" That is the result of following the Shepherd.<a name=372:11></a> You hear His voice and follow and eternal life is enjoyed.<a name=372:12></a> You are constantly in the enjoyment among the sheep of what is living, always sustained in the freshness of eternal life in the midst of all that is abroad in this world.<a name=372:13></a> "They shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.<a name=372:14></a>" We know something

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we come to chapter 21, and still there is the thought of following, and here it is a question of the Lord's word to Peter.<a name=373:3></a> I believe Peter represents the public history of the assembly; by that I mean the true assembly, not mere profession.<a name=373:4></a> What is true of Peter is that he undoubtedly loved the Lord.<a name=373:5></a> There is no question about that, but he had a chequered history publicly even to the extent of denying the Lord at one time, a most solemn matter, and we have to feel that, not only in regard to ourselves individually, but the unfaithfulness that has marked the history of the assembly.<a name=373:6></a> I believe Peter represents that, and yet at the end of John's gospel he is seen as recovered.<a name=373:7></a> We can take courage from that, for the Lord is working in the way of recovery in our day, so that what is proper to the assembly should come into expression in the assembly, and Peter represents that feature.<a name=373:8></a> John, I believe, represents the underlying work of God that goes through.<a name=373:9></a> He was leaning on Jesus' breast at supper, and Peter was not so near the Lord as that, but at the end Peter glorifies God by his death.<a name=373:10></a> That is something for us to have before us, that whatever it involves we are to finish to the glory of God.<a name=373:11></a> The Lord has to say to Peter, "When thou wast young thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest.<a name=373:12></a>" The girding himself refers to service, and we sometimes find when we are young and girded for service that a certain amount of self-will and independence enters into it.<a name=373:13></a> "But when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and bring thee where thou

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the Lord having said that to Peter, says "follow me," and Peter turns, showing how constantly the Lord has to remind us time after time of what is essential.<a name=374:8></a> He says, "Follow me," and when Peter turns he immediately sees John following, and he says to Jesus, "What shall this man do," and the Lord answering says, "If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee, follow thou me.<a name=374:9></a>" That is the last word to Peter recorded on the part of the Lord Jesus, and if we would finish well, as the Lord would have us finish to the glory of God, we can only do so as we set ourselves to follow the Lord, and that involves having an attentive ear to what He is saying in the ministry and giving it its proper place in our souls.<a name=374:10></a> May we prepare our hearts to have an attentive ear to whatever He is saying, because whatever the need of the moment is, and whatever He is seeking to secure in His people, the Lord will speak in relation to it.<a name=374:11></a> Christianity is a great system of movement.<a name=374:12></a> There is nothing stagnant about it, and if we would be in the current of what the Spirit has in mind the great thing for us is to have an attentive ear to what the Lord is saying and to follow it up.<a name=374:13></a>

		I desire, dear brethren, to speak of the assembly as it is presented in the epistle to the Ephesians.<a name=375:1></a> This epistle contemplates the assembly, not in its local aspect, as do the epistles to the Corinthians, but in its universal aspect, comprising all those who, having believed on the Lord Jesus Christ have been sealed with the Holy Spirit from the day of Pentecost until the day when the Lord takes His own to be with Himself.<a name=375:2></a> The first passage read in chapter 3 is more restricted in the sense that it refers to the whole assembly as it is on earth at the moment; that is, it is a question of what is seen in the assembly now, although, of course, it covers the whole period of the assembly's history on earth.<a name=375:3></a> Obviously it refers to what is seen at any particular time, in the assembly on earth at that moment.<a name=375:4></a> I trust all here are interested in the assembly, for it is the greatest conception of divine love and wisdom; it is to be both in the world to come and throughout eternity a vessel of divine glory, and it is the greatest conceivable privilege that you and I should have part in it.<a name=375:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The epistle to the Ephesians, and, of course, all the epistles, are written from the standpoint of Christ having risen from the dead and ascended to the right hand of God, so that certain things are apprehended now as come to pass in Him.<a name=376:2></a> It says, for instance, in the early part of chapter 1, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us .<a name=376:3></a>.<a name=376:4></a>.<a name=376:5></a> ", not 'who is going to bless us' but "who <i>has</i> blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ.<a name=376:6></a>" Christ being now in His position in the heavenlies at the right hand of God, having accomplished redemption, and the Holy Spirit having come down, it may be said in that way that God has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ; because that is what is in God's mind for us, and <i>all</i> that is in God's mind for us can be realised at the present time by the Holy Spirit, who is the earnest of the inheritance.<a name=376:7></a> When I say all, I mean <i>all</i>.<a name=376:8></a> There is, of course, the actual bodily condition, which is future, the bodily condition of conformity to Christ's own body of glory, and which is proper to heaven; but, subject to that limitation, there is no reason why believers should not enter already in the power of the Holy Spirit into the spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ which God has given us.<a name=376:9></a> Then, further, it says that He has made us accepted, or taken us into favour, in the Beloved.<a name=376:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before I speak of the Scriptures I have read I would specially call attention to what is conveyed by "favour in the Beloved," because I believe it is of great importance to apprehend the settled place that Christ is filling at the present time in the presence of God, in which He is presented to our hearts
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=377>[Page 377]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		as the Beloved in a most absolute way.<a name=377:1></a> He is beloved of God, and God would have us understand that Christ is now to be viewed in that position as loved of God in a settled way, the Beloved One commanding all the affections of the Father's heart.<a name=377:2></a> He is to be apprehended in that way, as the One in whom God has taken us into favour.<a name=377:3></a> There was no reason why Christ should have become Man if it were not that God had in mind for men the character of blessing which is now set forth in Christ as Man where He is.<a name=377:4></a> And therefore, if He is apprehended as He may be apprehended by us, as the Beloved, the Holy Spirit having been given to us, it is intended to convey to us that there has now come to pass in Christ in heaven, for ever beyond death and entirely outside of this world, a settled condition of love having its source in the Father, and its centre in Christ, and with ourselves embraced in it in Him; and all that, too, is according to divine purpose.<a name=377:5></a> It is not anything that we have devised, it is nothing we have thought of, it is something that God has purposed of Himself and for His own satisfaction before the foundation of the world.<a name=377:6></a> The bringing of the world into existence in due course, and all that has transpired in the history of the world, has just constituted so to speak the platform and surroundings on which and in the midst of which God is steadily carrying out His own purpose.<a name=377:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would ask all to weigh that over, because I believe the more these things sink into our hearts the more they will develop a spirit of worship God-ward.<a name=377:8></a> That is what the Spirit of God is labouring to develop amongst us, that we should worship God not as occupied merely with the way He has blessed us, but rather, so to speak, as losing sight of ourselves and having God Himself in His blessedness before our hearts; that He should have thought of such things!<a name=377:9></a> that He should have desired them.<a name=377:10></a>

		and then the wisdom by which they are effected, involving one divine Person becoming Man.<a name=378:1></a> The depths of love, too, in which they are effected, involving redemption through His blood, the blood of the Beloved; and then the power in which they have been effected, involving His being raised again from the dead and set down in the highest place at God's right hand in heaven.<a name=378:2></a> Then the coming in of another divine Person, the Holy Spirit, to bring the testimony of these things to our hearts and make them effective there, and to be in us the Spirit of God's Son, causing us to respond in sonship's affection to the blessed God.<a name=378:3></a> All these things are wonderful, dear brethren, and as we contemplate them and touch them they are intended to develop in us the spirit of worship, as Paul in introducing these things says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=378:4></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, coming to the scripture I read in the first chapter of the epistle, what is touched on is the mighty power of God, which the apostle mentions in order that we might understand that the mighty power of God is operating towards us.<a name=378:5></a> That is, we are not to think that the great things of God are so great that we cannot enter upon them, because the mighty power of God is operative towards us; and if we would allow its operation, so to speak, there is no limit to what we may touch in the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=378:6></a> Speaking of the mighty power of God leads me to speak of the way that God has not only raised Christ from the dead, but that He has set Him down at His own right hand in the heavenlies "far above all principality and power and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come and hath put all things under his feet.<a name=378:7></a>" The second chapter of Hebrews says, "We see not yet all things put under him," but God has <i>already</i> established Christ

		in that invulnerable position, and having done that He is entitled, so to speak, to regard all things as put under His feet.<a name=379:1></a> They are to be so actually very shortly, but Christ is now in an invulnerable position at the right hand of God and therefore faith takes account of all things as already put under His feet.<a name=379:2></a> So it says, "And has put all things under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the assembly, which is his body, the fulness of him who fills all in all.<a name=379:3></a>" That is one wonderful conception which we are to have in our minds, that the assembly is Christ's body.<a name=379:4></a> It is a very great vessel because, as I said, it is composed of all those who, having believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, have been sealed with the Holy Spirit, from the day of Pentecost right on till the moment when the Lord takes us to be with Himself.<a name=379:5></a> Who can number them?<a name=379:6></a> It is the greatest expression of divine wisdom that such a vessel, composed of those from every nation under the sun should be called out by means of the gospel and attached by the Holy Spirit to Christ, and formed by the Spirit's work, as one body; coordinated into one body as a vessel in which Christ Himself shall find perfect expression in His moral features in His love, in His wisdom, in everything that marks Him as Man, all is to find perfect expression in His body, the fulness of Him that filleth all in all.<a name=379:7></a>

		The filling of all things looks on to the coming day when there will not be anything that does not come under the effect of the influence of Christ, and that influence is to be exercised by means of His body.<a name=379:8></a> It is, so to speak, the mediatorial position that Christ has established in His place as Head, for He will exert His influence by means of which everything in all is to be filled through His body, the assembly.<a name=379:9></a> If that be so, you can understand how much God has to work out in us.<a name=379:10></a> The work will be complete in a day very soon to come.<a name=379:11></a> It will be understood what

	<div class="paragraph">
		Passing on to chapter 3, it speaks there of the assembly as that in which the manifold wisdom of God is now to be known to principalities and powers in heavenly places.<a name=380:9></a> Up till now, in speaking of the closing verses of chapter one, I have referred to what is as yet future in the actual display of it, but this passage brings us down to the present, and hence it is of the greatest importance.<a name=380:10></a> The apostle says, "To me, less than the least of all saints has this grace been given, to announce among the nations the glad tidings of the unsearchable riches of the Christ; and to enlighten all with the knowledge of what is the administration of the mystery, hidden throughout the ages in God.<a name=380:11></a>" "The administration of the mystery hidden throughout the ages in God.<a name=380:12></a>" It is not hidden now, it is being made known through Paul's ministry.<a name=380:13></a> But what is the administration of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the mystery?<a name=381:1></a> I hope every believer is interested in the thought of the mystery, because the idea of mystery means that we are initiated into something of which the world knows nothing, something that God has carefully concealed from the wise men of this world; as the Lord says, "I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes.<a name=381:2></a> Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.<a name=381:3></a>" And so, as I said, there is something mysterious which God is working out at the present time.<a name=381:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We should be interested, dear brethren, in the mystery, for it belongs to us, and it says "to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God.<a name=381:5></a>" When Satan first commenced his activities among men he had in mind, I believe, to rob God of His pleasure in men, and to show himself to be greater than God.<a name=381:6></a> Satan is very wise to outward appearance, but in the end it is going to be demonstrated that he has no wisdom.<a name=381:7></a> It says, "the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly"; and God in speaking to the serpent said that the woman's seed should bruise his head.<a name=381:8></a> The head is the seat of wisdom.<a name=381:9></a> So it says in the end of the epistle of Romans, "to God only wise," or as it might read "the God who alone is wise .<a name=381:10></a>.<a name=381:11></a>.<a name=381:12></a> .<a name=381:13></a> be glory for ever.<a name=381:14></a> Amen.<a name=381:15></a>" That is going to be shown, and is being shown at the present time in the assembly to principalities and powers in the heavenlies.<a name=381:16></a> We are not always aware how much interest there is among created intelligences in the heavenlies as to what is going on among the saints, but they are looking on.<a name=381:17></a> We are told in the first epistle of Peter that angels desire to look into certain things.<a name=381:18></a> They desire to look into them, and they are looking on, seeing what God is doing.<a name=381:19></a> Angels

	<div class="paragraph">
		You will remember how, in the early history of the assembly.<a name=382:9></a> Satan tried to blot out what God was doing by persecution; and later, after the decline had come in in the early history of the church the persecution was revived in the ordering of God and for a long period it became very intense.<a name=382:10></a> Then by means of that thing, which shows how completely God has the forces of evil under control, fidelity to Christ was revived; so that in the Lord's address to Smyrna, which contemplates that period in church history when persecution was particularly rampant, we find no word of rebuke, but the saints are viewed there as being faithful unto death.<a name=382:11></a> And thus by the very means of Satan's animosity and opposition God secured in the assembly at that time this quality of faithfulness unto death, a feature of Christ indeed, for He was supremely faithful to God, even unto death.<a name=382:12></a> I have no doubt that this was brought to pass actually by means of the faithful service of Christ, His love and sympathy, and by the service of the Holy Spirit; but then these things were unseen, but what is seen is what comes to light in the assembly.<a name=382:13></a> What came to light in the assembly at that period was that God is so wise, that He was able to make use of the very means that Satan was

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Later on God began to work at the time of the Reformation, and He overthrew some of Rome's power, preparing the way for what was to follow.<a name=383:6></a> He established the great principle of justification by faith and, by doing so, undermined the authority of the church of Rome in the souls of many, and established the great ground on which, in subsequent years, recovery to assembly truth has been possible.<a name=383:7></a> The Holy Spirit was not availed of by the saints in a collective way for many years, or until within the last 120 years or so, but in these last days, God has been working in a powerful way of recovering the truth of the assembly; that the assembly has a glorious Head in heaven, and that the Spirit of God is here on earth, so that we can be free from all domination of the mind and will of man in the things of God, for no man has authority over the saints in the things of God.<a name=383:8></a> Christ is Head of the body, the assembly, and the Spirit is here as indwelling the saints, and as these things have been practically

		Well now, let us see how these things work.<a name=384:5></a> The ground has only been secured through much conflict, conflict for the sake of the Lord and for the sake of the assembly, involving that we have even had to separate from our own brethren.<a name=384:6></a> What has that brought to light?<a name=384:7></a> Such sorrows here, in the wisdom of God, brought to light true assembly affections; that is to say, the very exercise involved in it has developed, in the hearts of the saints who have responded to the truth, a determination that by the grace of God they will be true to Christ whatever it costs; that even though it should mean separation from their brethren, they will be true to Christ.<a name=384:8></a> And thus, by the very means of these exercises the quality of assembly affection for Christ is being developed and has come into evidence, so that principalities and powers in the heavenlies may see in the assembly, through the working out of the mystery, the all-various wisdom of God.<a name=384:9></a>

		Everyone will recognise that the world, the great system built up by Satan, is becoming increasingly difficult in every sphere, the political sphere, the social sphere, the commercial sphere, and every sphere; it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep it going, all the elements of disintegration are there.<a name=386:2></a> Over against that the body of Christ, the assembly, is becoming increasingly knit together, like Joseph's sheaf in the field.<a name=386:3></a> He says, "We were binding sheaves in the field, and lo my sheaf arose, and also stood upright.<a name=386:4></a>" The supremacy of Christ's sheaf comes into evidence, the way saints are being bound together and are remaining standing in the power of the life of Christ.<a name=386:5></a> Every association, whether it be religious or any other association, carries with it the elements of disintegration, and will never stand; the only thing that will remain standing is that which is of Christ, the saints held together in one body in love which is the bond of perfectness.<a name=386:6></a> All the conditions in the world are only serving to develop His own thoughts regarding the assembly, and in the assembly is being seen by principalities and powers the all-various wisdom of God.<a name=386:7></a> I trust that our eyes may be opened to these things, for there are great things moving, and it is for us to spend all our spiritual energies towards the apprehension of what it is we are called to, and to learn how we are to have part in what God is doing at the present time.<a name=386:8></a> At the end of chapter 3 the apostle says "unto him be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages.<a name=386:9></a>" That is to say,

		I feel impressed, beloved brethren, to say a word as to prayer, prayer characteristically and prayer specifically, both individual and collective, because prayer is one of the most important things that we are called upon to give ourselves to.<a name=393:1></a> It is not limited to those who are advanced in the faith, or specially spiritual, for the apostle in writing to the Thessalonian saints who at the time were very young in the faith, only perhaps a few weeks old, said to them, "pray without ceasing.<a name=393:2></a>" Moreover, he said to those same saints, "Brethren, pray for us.<a name=393:3></a>" It is a remarkable thing that the apostle and his fellow-workers should desire and value the prayers of very young believers, and I would commend that to young believers, to begin early to pray for other needs besides their own personal ones and their own exercises, because to have to do with God and with the Lord in prayer and to begin to take up in prayer divine interests however simply it may be done, will be of great help to oneself as well as, of course, tending to promote the interests of God, for we cannot cultivate being in the presence of God without being greatly helped by it.<a name=393:4></a> These are days in which it is of all importance that we should become stable in the truth and happy in it too, that we may have real liberty and also joy, mingled, of course, with right feelings, involving the sorrows of the testimony.<a name=393:5></a> It is a day in which it is urgent that we should prove the power and reality of Christianity, every one for himself or herself, and not leave it for a few.<a name=393:6></a> We are to pay attention to our roots and foundations, and to cultivate being in the presence of the Lord and of God will go a long way to helping us become stronger spiritually.<a name=393:7></a>

		Now in the passage I commenced with, in the third chapter of Luke's gospel, the Lord is presented as praying.<a name=394:1></a> It is where He first comes out under public notice in the testimony.<a name=394:2></a> He had been under public notice to some extent before, for it is said that He "advanced in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and men," <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:52">Luke  2:52</a>.<a name=394:3></a> Men had taken account of Him, but now as He is about to come out and take up His service publicly, He is presented not only as being baptised, but as also praying.<a name=394:4></a> We are not told what He was praying about, but the fact is simply stated that He was praying, and we are intended to gather from that, that it was characteristic of Him, that He was characterised by prayer, and that indeed is a feature of true manhood.<a name=394:5></a> It is man's glory, true glory, that he is dependent upon God, that he does not assume to be self-supporting or self-sufficient, but that he needs God and depends upon Him.<a name=394:6></a> That is true glory in manhood, and it was specially set out in the Lord Jesus when He first appeared to take up His service publicly.<a name=394:7></a> It was then the voice from heaven said, "Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight.<a name=394:8></a>" God is referring to what Jesus had been under His eye during the period of about thirty years which had then elapsed.<a name=394:9></a> That is an important matter to pay attention to, dear brethren, that if we are to have liberty and power with God in prayer, it is necessary that we should be pleasing to Him in the circumstances in which He has set us.<a name=394:10></a> There is nothing necessarily showy about that, nothing that makes anything of us, nothing that appeals to the natural man, but to be pleasing to God in the circumstances which He has ordered for us, whether it be in home life or business or school life, to be pleasing to Him in them is one of the first things that we have to learn.<a name=394:11></a> Dependence upon God, lowliness, and contentment in the acceptance of everything as from Him,

		In <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#5">Luke  5</a>we find crowds coming to Jesus, but He withdrew Himself into the desert places and was praying.<a name=396:3></a> That is a word for those who serve, that they are to beware of undue publicity or popularity, and if anything of that sort arises, their wisdom is to withdraw to desert places; that is, to withdraw from everything that would pander to the flesh.<a name=396:4></a> I am not suggesting, of course, that the Lord Jesus had any occasion to pay attention to that consideration; I am not suggesting that for one moment, but His actions were intended as an example to us.<a name=396:5></a> If there is anything in the course of our service that might tend to elate the flesh, then wisdom lies in withdrawing from it and praying.<a name=396:6></a> So that we come into the presence of God, and things are seen just as they are, and you are seen just as you are, and that is where safety lies.<a name=396:7></a> Then in the following chapter we find that the Lord went into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.<a name=396:8></a> There was something special to pray about, something of great importance.<a name=396:9></a> It was a question of choosing the twelve, and one of them to be a devil, the son of perdition.<a name=396:10></a> You can understand what it would mean to the Lord Jesus to have to select the twelve and that it should be required of Him that one of those twelve should be a son of perdition.<a name=396:11></a> There may be occasions when the urgency of the matters to be prayed for and the amount that there is to be prayed for, call for a certain surrender of the time we may normally spend in sleep.<a name=396:12></a> You will remember that the altar of incense was part of the service of the

		So, dear brethren, in chapter 9 of the same gospel, we find the Lord praying alone, and further, in verse 28, He took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.<a name=397:3></a> "And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering," showing that if we pray we may find ourselves introduced into heavenly scenes where for a moment, we may leave behind the exercises that call for prayer and find ourselves in a position of privilege.<a name=397:4></a> How suggestive it is, that it was "as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered.<a name=397:5></a>" He took on, as it were, heavenly glory.<a name=397:6></a> All these things are delineated for us in the gospel of Luke, which particularly sets out the features of manhood according to God as presented perfectly in Christ, and intended to be taken account of by His people.<a name=397:7></a> Again, in chapter 11, the Lord is seen praying "in a certain place"; that is to say, prayer there has in mind local needs.<a name=397:8></a> That is something that every brother and sister ought to take up in prayer not only at the prayer meeting, but privately as well.<a name=397:9></a> If I may be permitted, I would like to say to any brother who has not enjoyed much in the way of liberty in thanksgiving and praise in divine service, that I believe that if we cultivate private and specific prayer in relation to divine interests, it will promote liberty with God, and when the time for liberty arises, we shall find ourselves set free.<a name=397:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What comes into view in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#11">Luke  11</a>is not only the importance of praying in relation to local needs, but the need of being specific in our prayers.<a name=397:11></a> There

		is prayer as characteristic of us and indicating dependence, but there is also specific prayer.<a name=398:1></a> Hence the need of knowing what to ask for, and asking for it.<a name=398:2></a> So the Lord says, "If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone?<a name=398:3></a> or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?<a name=398:4></a> Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?<a name=398:5></a>" The Lord is suggesting definiteness in prayer, that we are to know whether to ask for bread, or for fish, or for an egg.<a name=398:6></a> All these things are in relation to local needs, and the importance, therefore, of knowing what is needed in the locality, because the whole setting of that passage is that the Lord may come to visit that locality to see what is there, and the one who prays is faced with the possibility that he may have nothing to set before Him when He comes.<a name=398:7></a> "Which of you," the Lord says, "shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves; for a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him.<a name=398:8></a>" It is suggestive of the Lord coming unexpectedly to see what He finds in a certain locality, and the responsibility of those there who are concerned that the Lord will not find an absence of anything He can appreciate.<a name=398:9></a> So we are to pray, and know whether the need is food, which the bread might suggest, or whether there is a need for spiritual energy which the fish might suggest, or whether what is needed is, so to speak, life in embryo, which the egg might suggest, the need for the coming generation.<a name=398:10></a> The whole point I believe, in the passage is that we should have regard for what the needs are, and be specific in our prayers.<a name=398:11></a>

		To refer now to the passage in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22">Luke  22</a>, we come to a most solemn moment in the path of the Lord Jesus, and it is a question of how the will of God is to be carried through to completion, for that is what was immediately before the mind of the Lord.<a name=398:12></a> The

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord says to His disciples in verse 40, "Pray that ye enter not into temptation.<a name=400:2></a>" Then in verse 45 it says "when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow.<a name=400:3></a> And said unto them, Why sleep ye?<a name=400:4></a> Rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.<a name=400:5></a>" Now the point was that Satan was near, and Satan is near us, and we may rest assured that as the testimony is being carried to completion, he will do his utmost to overcome the saints in some way or another.<a name=400:6></a> And hence the need of prayer; "rise and pray.<a name=400:7></a>" It is not the time for sleeping.<a name=400:8></a> I am not speaking, of course, of literal sleep; it is the time for rising up and praying, and praying that we may not enter into temptation.<a name=400:9></a> The dispensation is about to close and the Lord is looking to it that we should carry forward every feature of the truth to completion.<a name=400:10></a> It is urgent that we should be constant in prayer and not find ourselves in a position that we have not faith for, and thus be led into temptation and fail in regard of the testimony.<a name=400:11></a> There is no reason, of course, why we should fail.<a name=400:12></a> The Lord said, "rise and pray that ye enter not into temptation.<a name=400:13></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, passing from that, I wanted in the passage in <a href="../bible/John.htm#15">John  15</a>to show that the Lord contemplates that we should have power with God, and I believe the Lord has in mind in this scripture, what will mark us as moving on together.<a name=400:14></a> I do not mean necessarily limiting it to collective prayer, though it would include that; but the point the Lord has in mind is that His disciples should be going on together as committed to God's testimony.<a name=400:15></a> And as feeling what it is to be in a world in which they are hated, the Lord stresses the importance of loving one another.<a name=400:16></a> "If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you.<a name=400:17></a> If ye were of the

		world, the world would love his own.<a name=401:1></a>" So it is contemplated that as we go on, and the nearer we reach to completion, the more we shall become conscious that the world hates us, but that is not to cause us to surrender or in any way to compromise, but we are to find support in the company of the brethren.<a name=401:2></a> The matter is imperative.<a name=401:3></a> It is one of the bulwarks of the testimony that whatever has to be met in the outside sphere, the support needed for the position will be found in the circle of the brethren.<a name=401:4></a> Hence how important it is that we should cultivate love and enjoy the mutual support and encouragement which the circle of love affords.<a name=401:5></a> So the Lord says in verse 7, "If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.<a name=401:6></a>" That is a remarkable statement, showing as I said before that it may be possible for us to effect far more by the power we have with God in prayer than by anything we can do ourselves, and this is evidently open to all.<a name=401:7></a> It is not a question of those who are gifted, but "if ye abide in me.<a name=401:8></a>" As abiding in Christ we take character from Him; it develops that which will give us power with God.<a name=401:9></a> "If ye abide in me .<a name=401:10></a>.<a name=401:11></a>.<a name=401:12></a> ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.<a name=401:13></a>" It is a question of asking what we will and having it answered, which involves, of course, that our prayers are in keeping with the will of God and the needs of the moment.<a name=401:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These are very encouraging statements, and then the Lord says, "Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit"; indicating, I believe, that this would be a feature that marked the Lord personally, and now it is to be continued in the disciples.<a name=401:15></a> You remember how at the grave of Lazarus the Lord said, "Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.<a name=401:16></a> And I knew that thou hearest me always.<a name=401:17></a>" Think of that!<a name=401:18></a> He had already requested something in relation to the raising of

		What possibilities there are, beloved brethren, if we would only seek to cultivate the reality of abiding in Christ.<a name=402:5></a> Thus shall we become intelligent and understand what the testimony calls for and what the needs of the moment are, because the Lord will continue speaking to the end of the dispensation.<a name=402:6></a> There is no question about that.<a name=402:7></a> It is an evidence of His love.<a name=402:8></a> He says in His word to Philadelphia, "because thou hast a little power, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name .<a name=402:9></a>.<a name=402:10></a>.<a name=402:11></a> behold, I will cause that they shall come and shall do homage before thy feet, and shall know that I have loved thee," <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:9">Revelation  3:9</a>.<a name=402:12></a> Meaning that He will take us out of it to be with Himself; but He places it on the footing that we have kept the word of His patience.<a name=402:13></a> We were saying on a previous occasion that the Lord is patient, and we have to be patient.<a name=402:14></a> We have to go on with the testimony not knowing when it is coming to an end.<a name=402:15></a> Even the Son takes the place of not knowing the day or the hour.<a name=402:16></a> We know not what hour the testimony may end, but we may get impressions that the end is near at hand.<a name=402:17></a> Throughout the period of Christ's patience He will speak to those who love Him, and His speaking will afford us guidance; and as I was saying, He bases His promise to us on the fact that we have kept the word of His patience.<a name=402:18></a> It is for us to see that we do it and that we do it on these lines, that His word abides in us and we abide in Him.<a name=402:19></a> We can affect

		the whole course of things in the company, or in the world of Christian profession, by our prayers, if the testimony demands it.<a name=403:1></a> There is no limit to what we may do in our prayers if the testimony requires it.<a name=403:2></a> You will remember when Joshua was bringing the people into the land and a battle was being waged against the enemy, and, so to speak, the matter was not completed, Joshua called upon the sun to stand still.<a name=403:3></a> There was a man asking what the exigencies of the moment required, in order that God's thoughts in regard of His people should be carried through then and there to completion.<a name=403:4></a> He called upon the sun to stand still, and the result was that the victory was completed, and God came into the matter, so that there were more slain by the hail-stones which came down from heaven than were slain by the children of Israel.<a name=403:5></a> God will come into the matter if we pray as those who have power with Him.<a name=403:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In conclusion, I read the passage from <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#122">Psalm  122</a>in order to add a little increased definiteness to this matter of our prayers.<a name=403:7></a> The psalmist is speaking of Jerusalem, and Jerusalem for us means the assembly.<a name=403:8></a> Jerusalem was God's centre of interest upon earth, and that at the present time is unquestionably the assembly.<a name=403:9></a> Jerusalem is not exactly Zion, for I understand that Zion in its typical bearing refers to the assembly according to God's thoughts regarding it, but Jerusalem is more the concrete expression of those thoughts down here; that is to say, when it refers to Jerusalem, it is the assembly just the same, but viewed as in actual expression amongst the saints.<a name=403:10></a> So it says, "Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together," stressing the importance of love among ourselves, for there is nothing so compacting in its influence as love among ourselves.<a name=403:11></a> That is something that Satan will always seek to attack, and we must therefore lay ourselves out to preserve love among us.<a name=403:12></a>

		While I am speaking a great deal about prayer and the importance of making time for it, not only when we are together but also privately, it must not be thought that I am decrying right activity, for there is a call for right activity also.<a name=404:1></a> We are told to do whatever our hands find to do, with all our might.<a name=404:2></a> In chapter 10 of Luke we see the activities of love in the good Samaritan.<a name=404:3></a> "Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.<a name=404:4></a>" It is self-sacrificing love in care for the saints.<a name=404:5></a> So that while I am emphasising the great importance of prayer, it must not be thought that I am in any way belittling activity; there must be room made for both.<a name=404:6></a> We are to realise increasingly that divine things call for our whole time committal to them; there is no time for anything else.<a name=404:7></a> There are legitimate duties, of course, that have to be fulfilled, but the time is such, and the truth that the Lord is giving is such, and the state of the world is such, that divine things call for complete committal to them.<a name=404:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Referring again to this matter of Jerusalem being compacted together, each one of us contributes his own part in it, so that if there is any little element of personal disagreement among the saints which would interfere with this compacting together, it must be got rid of.<a name=404:9></a> Self-judgment and forgiveness must come in, forgiveness specially marking our day; "forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you," <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:32">Ephesians  4:32</a>.<a name=404:10></a> What a glorious time was the year of jubilee in Israel, and that is what is characteristic of this day of Christianity, the glorious year of jubilee; see <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#25:8">Leviticus  25:8</a> -- 10.<a name=404:11></a>

		Then it says, "Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the Lord.<a name=404:12></a>" That is suggestive of the service of God in the assembly.<a name=404:13></a> Thank God, we are being greatly helped in it.<a name=404:14></a>
