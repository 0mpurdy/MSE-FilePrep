		A.J.<a name=1:1></a>G.<a name=1:2></a> The subject of eternal life is one that is constantly being revived and stressed among us, because it is only as we know more and more of eternal life that we become furnished and enriched in view of the service of God, and also because it is that which makes us superior to things around us, so as to be here for God; and one thing that requires to be pressed in relation to it is the need of faith on our part.<a name=1:3></a> It is to be noticed in the scriptures read and in others too, how much the thought of believing enters into them, that it is not simply confidence in God, but rather that our outlook is toward unseen things, toward Christ Himself, and toward the things that are connected with Him, and this is perhaps one of our points of greatest weakness, the great need among us of active faith.<a name=1:4></a> The Holy Spirit will link Himself in His service to us and His power with faith, but faith is essential, and hence John tells us that he writes his gospel so that we might "believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing we might have life in his name.<a name=1:5></a>" So that life in the name of the Christ, the Son of God, that is, life in relation to the whole range of interests and glory connected with Jesus known in that light, is to be realised on the principle of believing -- that believing we might have life in His name.<a name=1:6></a> Hence where we commenced reading in chapter 3 the Lord raises the question of unbelief; He says, "If I have said the earthly things to you, and ye believe not, how, if I say the heavenly things to you, will ye believe?<a name=1:7></a>" and then He brings in eternal life as the great object that has been in the mind of God in giving His only begotten Son.<a name=1:8></a> So that at the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=2>[Page 2]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		outset we should be impressed with the importance in the sight of God of eternal life for us, that it was in His mind in giving His only begotten Son.<a name=2:1></a> But as we have been saying, it is to be entered upon on the principle of active faith in us.<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.G.<a name=2:3></a>H.<a name=2:4></a> Would you say what you have in mind in the expression "active faith"?<a name=2:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=2:6></a>G.<a name=2:7></a> Paul says in the second epistle to the Corinthians, "while we look not at the things that are seen, but at the things that are not seen; for the things that are seen are for a time, but those that are not seen eternal," <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:18">2 Corinthians  4:18</a>.<a name=2:8></a> So that there is a lot that enters into that -- "while we look not," he says, "at the things that are seen," involving certain purpose of heart as to the direction in which our outlook is going to be; while we look not at the things that are seen but at the things that are unseen, and that is what I had in mind in speaking of active faith.<a name=2:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.L.<a name=2:10></a>M.<a name=2:11></a> Would eternal life be the crown of John's ministry?<a name=2:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=2:13></a>G.<a name=2:14></a> I am not sure whether we can say it is the crown exactly because he leads further in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>, but I believe it is a great point in his ministry that we should have life in the name of Jesus, the Christ, the Son of God, and then in the epistle that we should know that we have eternal life.<a name=2:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.D.<a name=2:16></a>T.<a name=2:17></a> Is it rather more the sphere in which God is operating?<a name=2:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=2:19></a>G.<a name=2:20></a> I think so.<a name=2:21></a> It contemplates a sphere.<a name=2:22></a> It says, "passed out of death into life" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#5:24">John  5:24</a>) and the verse we read at the end of chapter 3 says, "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand," so that there is introduced the idea of a range of interests, of living interests, into which we are to find a part already.<a name=2:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.D.<a name=2:24></a>T.<a name=2:25></a> I was thinking in a certain sense it was basic in relation to John's line of things.<a name=2:26></a> There are

	<div class="paragraph">
		many things that are added -- association with Christ as His brethren, and sonship, and a great many other things that are involved; but I wondered whether eternal life was the prime thought, that God is operating in relation to Christ out of death, and the sphere that is opened up to us as a result of that.<a name=3:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=3:2></a>G.<a name=3:3></a> Yes, I think that is right as far as I understand.<a name=3:4></a> It is clear that eternal life has reference to heavenly things, so that the Lord speaks of heavenly things to Nicodemus.<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.A.<a name=3:6></a>L.<a name=3:7></a> I was thinking of faith.<a name=3:8></a> Do you not think we are rather weak in laying hold of the great truth of the incarnation?<a name=3:9></a> "This life is in his Son" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:11">1 John  5:11</a>), and I was thinking of verse 4 of chapter 1, "In him was life.<a name=3:10></a>" He has brought it in in His own Person, hence faith is to be connected with the Son of God.<a name=3:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=3:12></a>G.<a name=3:13></a> Yes, I think so, and that is most affecting that such great matters are in mind, as you say; the incarnation, and then as chapter 6 has it, the Son of man having ascended up where He was before, and the Spirit having come.<a name=3:14></a> All these are matters that enter into our entrance into eternal life, are they not?<a name=3:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.McK.<a name=3:16></a> In regard to the matter of active faith, is the passage in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21">Numbers  21</a>basic to what you have in mind?<a name=3:17></a> That is to say, everyone that looked upon the serpent lived.<a name=3:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=3:19></a>G.<a name=3:20></a> Yes, I think so.<a name=3:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.A.<a name=3:22></a>L.<a name=3:23></a> Do not both the scriptures that you started with in chapter 3 clearly place eternal life on the other side of death?<a name=3:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=3:25></a>G.<a name=3:26></a> That is an important matter, because there is the idea of life, which sometimes in John's writings is the same thing as eternal life but sometimes has a wider thought; but eternal life is definitely connected with an order of things beyond death.<a name=3:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.D.<a name=3:28></a>T.<a name=3:29></a> That is just what I had in mind in my

		earlier remark, that in a certain sense it is the foundation of what John has to present, is it not?<a name=4:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=4:2></a>G.<a name=4:3></a> I think it is, and hence it comes in very early in the instruction of the gospel because in one sense the third chapter introduces the beginning of the teaching, not, of course, that there is not valuable teaching in chapters one and two, but <a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>begins at new birth and the teaching develops systematically from that point, and I thought it was striking that eternal life is brought in so early.<a name=4:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.J.<a name=4:5></a>H.<a name=4:6></a> Why does the word 'things' appear so much?<a name=4:7></a> "If I have said the earthly <i>things</i> to you," and then "heavenly <i>things</i>," the Lord says.<a name=4:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=4:9></a>G.<a name=4:10></a> Well, because life consists in things as well as in persons.<a name=4:11></a> That is, there are affections and interests, and eternal life has relation to a heavenly order of things, a heavenly order of relationships and affections first, but also to things; so that it says, "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand.<a name=4:12></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.J.<a name=4:13></a>H.<a name=4:14></a> I thought perhaps what you said as to a range of interests enters very definitely into the matter, so that we cannot claim to be in the enjoyment of this precious blessing unless we are linked up with the things that are precious to Christ?<a name=4:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=4:16></a>G.<a name=4:17></a> Quite so.<a name=4:18></a> They all centre in the Person of the Son, and God has given us eternal life and this life is in His Son.<a name=4:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.D.<a name=4:20></a>T.<a name=4:21></a> Would it be diverting you to ask what the connection is between the kingdom and eternal life, seeing they both come into this chapter?<a name=4:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=4:23></a>G.<a name=4:24></a> I suppose the kingdom is necessary because of our condition.<a name=4:25></a> We need to be brought under the authority of the word.<a name=4:26></a> Perhaps you would help us yourself.<a name=4:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.D.<a name=4:28></a>T.<a name=4:29></a> I was just thinking that new birth being connected with the kingdom, we got an impression that in the initial operations of God in the soul, it

		was all in relation to another sphere of things altogether; what Mr.<a name=5:1></a> Raven called 'the moral sway of God in the soul of a person' is really the kingdom, and it gives us an understanding that God is operating in relation to Christ out of death, and He bestows eternal life, so that we may come into a sphere of things in which His pleasure is unalterably secured.<a name=5:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=5:3></a>G.<a name=5:4></a> Yes, I think that is right; hence the moral side of things must come in, and so the Lord says, "the Son of man <i>must</i> be lifted up," <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:14">John  3:14</a>.<a name=5:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.C.<a name=5:6></a> So is the serpent of brass an aspect of the death of Christ as clearing the ground of every moral question, so that we may be free to take up the enjoyment of eternal life?<a name=5:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=5:8></a>G.<a name=5:9></a> Yes, I think so.<a name=5:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.A.<a name=5:11></a>L.<a name=5:12></a> Then the kingdom involves essentially an administration.<a name=5:13></a> There is the heavenly side as well as the earthly side of the kingdom.<a name=5:14></a> I wondered whether verses 35 and 36 give us the full scope of it, the glory of the administration of the Son.<a name=5:15></a> One of the things that are administered is eternal life.<a name=5:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=5:17></a>G.<a name=5:18></a> I think it is a great thing to understand that there is a range of holy affections and interests that are eternal in character of which the Son is the centre and the Father the great source, into which already we have entrance in the Holy Spirit.<a name=5:19></a> So that eternal life, although it is known on earth, is essentially heavenly in its character, and it is eternal in its character, so that in the Spirit we may touch things which are in their character eternal, and in a moment we shall find ourselves in them.<a name=5:20></a> But the point is how much we know of them now.<a name=5:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.A.<a name=5:22></a>L.<a name=5:23></a> It must be eternal because of the Person from whom it proceeds, and the order of life that it is.<a name=5:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=5:25></a>G.<a name=5:26></a> Yes, quite so.<a name=5:27></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=6:3></a>G.<a name=6:4></a> I am not sure whether that is not the "we" of dignity.<a name=6:5></a> "We speak that which we know and we bear witness of that which we have seen.<a name=6:6></a>" There is a sense in which the plural is used, not as meaning many persons or more than one person, but more in the sense of dignity.<a name=6:7></a> I am not sure whether that is not the case here.<a name=6:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		D.McI.<a name=6:9></a> Is that why the Lord lays emphasis on what He says?<a name=6:10></a> He says, "I say the heavenly things.<a name=6:11></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=6:12></a>G.<a name=6:13></a> I think there is a great deal of importance to be attached to the words of Christ, indeed in chapter 6 Peter says "thou hast words of life eternal" (verse 68), that is, as they companied with the Lord what the Lord spoke to them about was the things connected with life eternal.<a name=6:14></a> He did not engage them with the politics of the world and that kind of thing.<a name=6:15></a> He engaged them with eternal life, and Peter recognised that and he says "thou hast words of life eternal.<a name=6:16></a>" We need to pay attention to the words of Jesus which John's gospel is made up of almost entirely.<a name=6:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.J.<a name=6:18></a>H.<a name=6:19></a> Would that suggest a continuous flow, and a continuous unfolding?<a name=6:20></a> There is nothing stationary or stagnant in it.<a name=6:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=6:22></a>G.<a name=6:23></a> No, there is not.<a name=6:24></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=6:29></a>G.<a name=6:30></a> I think it is a most touching thing how near eternal things are brought to us now, the Son having come and having accomplished redemption and ascended up where He was before, the Spirit having been given, all that is in the heart of God is opened to us and it is connected with eternal things bound up with the Father and the Son.<a name=6:31></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=7:4></a>G.<a name=7:5></a> Yes, I think so, that is what it says, "And this is the eternal life, that they should know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent," <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:3">John  17:3</a>.<a name=7:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		G.A.<a name=7:7></a>L.<a name=7:8></a> Do you think that perhaps it is a little easier to centre faith on a man in the glory than to understand the blessed dignity of God having sent His Son down here to bring in life, to bring in His words, to make known His mind, and bring everything in in His own blessed Person?<a name=7:9></a> I have been struck with the glorious dignity of the incarnation.<a name=7:10></a> How much is brought in in the Person of the Son, how everything is there substantially in a Person, "In him is life," and one has felt it is the special urge of John's ministry to bring us into the gain of that.<a name=7:11></a>

		A.J.<a name=8:5></a>G.<a name=8:6></a> Yes, quite so.<a name=8:7></a> The circle of the brethren is the sphere where things are enjoyed.<a name=8:8></a> At the same time the initial presentation of it in John's gospel is rather on the individual line.<a name=8:9></a> As we go on we find it is enjoyed in the circle of the brethren, and only there, but at the same time the gospel is presenting the truth systematically and insisting on the importance of the individual having it.<a name=8:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=8:20></a>G.<a name=8:21></a> That is it, and I believe it is important to stress this, perhaps not unduly, but still it should be stressed, because some years ago a great deal of emphasis was laid, and rightly so, on salvation being in the assembly; it has been greatly stressed, and rightly so, that young people find salvation in keeping with the saints and so on, and one does not want to say a word to weaken that because that is most important; but at the same time that in itself does not constitute eternal life.<a name=8:22></a> There must be the personal entering into it in the power of faith and the Spirit to touch the reality of eternal life.<a name=8:23></a>

		A.J.<a name=10:23></a>G.<a name=10:24></a> I think we can say that because it says in the epistle to Titus, "In the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before the ages of time," <a href="../bible/Titus.htm#1:2">Titus  1:2</a>.<a name=10:25></a> So that I think it is quite right to say that it has been in God's mind for man before the ages of time.<a name=10:26></a>

		A.J.<a name=12:4></a>G.<a name=12:5></a> Yes, I think that is right, so that it would be right, I suppose, broadly to say that the gospel of John presents the truth objectively, and the epistle of John presents the subjective side of things.<a name=12:6></a> In the gospel of John, for instance, the Lord says that He Himself is the truth.<a name=12:7></a> "I am the way, and the truth, and the life," <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:6">John  14:6</a>.<a name=12:8></a> In the epistle it says the Spirit is the truth, so that those are the two sides we have to keep together in balance.<a name=12:9></a>

		A.J.<a name=29:1></a>G.<a name=29:2></a> We scarcely had time this morning to go into chapter 6 as fully as is desirable, so I thought we should return to it this afternoon.<a name=29:3></a> Chapter 6, as we were saying, has in mind how spiritual life is sustained, and deals with the matter, as chapters 3 and 4 do also, from the individual standpoint, the early chapters in John's gospel having in view the building up of the believer's constitution in order to his being able to fit into his place in the assembly, because the assembly is the great thought before the mind of God.<a name=29:4></a> But it is essential that every brother and sister should be in it livingly, and hence the early chapters of John's gospel have that in mind.<a name=29:5></a> Then we shall see, as the Lord helps us, that when we come to chapter 10 and onwards the collective position is in view.<a name=29:6></a> It was remarked this morning that we have in verse 53 of chapter 6, "Unless ye shall have eaten the flesh of the Son of man and drunk his blood, ye have no life in yourselves," that being an initial thought; and then following on that, "He that <i>eats</i> my flesh and drinks my blood has life eternal," that being a characteristic and continuous thought.<a name=29:7></a> The Lord presents Himself in chapter 6 as the bread of life, as He says, "I am the living bread which has come down out of heaven: if any one shall have eaten of this bread he shall live for ever," and then he immediately adds, "but the bread withal which I shall give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.<a name=29:8></a>" This shows that while we have first of all to apprehend the idea that Christ is Himself the food which we are to appropriate continually if we would live, when it comes to the matter of our appropriation we have first of all to learn to eat His flesh and drink His blood, which
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=30>[Page 30]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		evidently is an allusion to His death.<a name=30:1></a> So that the import of His death is to be brought home to us continually, and our affections fed upon it before we come to the further thought that he who eats Me, even he shall live on account of Me.<a name=30:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.B.<a name=30:3></a> Does the question of eating His flesh and drinking His blood involve the breaking with natural things here?<a name=30:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=30:5></a>G.<a name=30:6></a> Yes, I think it does.<a name=30:7></a> It helps us greatly to understand that He came down from heaven and took flesh and blood condition in order by His death to terminate that condition and bring in in Himself beyond death as Man a new character of life altogether in which we are given part in the Spirit.<a name=30:8></a> Hence we are continually to feed on the great fact of His having come down from heaven and died.<a name=30:9></a> That will help us, as you say, to become detached more and more from natural things, because the things of nature hold us much more than we realise, even when perhaps we have learned in some degree to judge the flesh.<a name=30:10></a>

		A.J.<a name=31:11></a>G.<a name=31:12></a> Yes, "become in him.<a name=31:13></a>" I think it is very encouraging to see as has often been remarked, that John writes in view of the last days, the days when all that Paul set up had gone to pieces, but he brings in the great principle of life, so that no thought of God is allowed to lapse after all, it goes through in the energy of life in those who are affected by John's teaching.<a name=31:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=32:20></a>G.<a name=32:21></a> Yes, I think so.<a name=32:22></a> Because after all, although the Lord's pathway here was one of much suffering and sorrow, "Man of sorrows" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#53:3">Isaiah  53:3</a>) it says, yet on the other hand it was a life of continual joy -- He speaks of "my joy" -- and much pleasure to God.<a name=32:23></a> But that life was laid down, which meant He surrendered it, and God surrendered it, but it was laid down with a view to opening up in Himself beyond death an order of life in which we are given part.<a name=32:24></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=61:1></a>G.<a name=61:2></a> We are seeking to get help together on the matter of <i>eternal life</i>.<a name=61:3></a> We had it before us yesterday from John's gospel, and particularly noted the importance of active faith on our part -- the thought of believing is constantly brought in in relation to eternal life.<a name=61:4></a> So that the end of the gospel says that John recorded the signs that he did record, in order that we might "believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that <i>believing</i> we might have life in his name," <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:31">John  20:31</a>.<a name=61:5></a> So that eternal life includes, as has been said, a sphere of affections and relationships and interests which are all involved in the name of "the Christ the Son of God" and lie outside this scene, though to be known while we are in it and to be entered upon in the Spirit, and eternal life was what was in the mind of God when He gave His only-begotten Son.<a name=61:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now, when we come to the epistle, John tells us that he writes his epistle in order that we may know that we have eternal life, not simply have it before us as an idea, but prove the reality of it, because Christianity is nothing if it is not life, known in power.<a name=61:7></a> The importance of that becomes more and more evident as departure from the truth marks the public position, that the truth is supported in life, not by the maintenance of correct doctrine, though that is important in its place, but it is supported in life.<a name=61:8></a> Hence the writer of the epistle, John, is stressing now the reality of things in the saints; indeed in chapter 2 (the part we did not read) he says, "which thing is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing and the true light already shines.<a name=61:9></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So that he begins by reverting to "that which was
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=62>[Page 62]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		from the beginning," and he maintains that all through his epistle, the importance of our learning what was from the beginning and having our thoughts governed by it, not allowing any departure from it or addition to it, but understanding that Christianity in its true features was set out in the beginning, that is in Christ as Man here, and that is to give its character to it.<a name=62:1></a> So that he speaks of the "Word of life," referring to what came under the notice of the apostles in the pathway of Jesus here -- "The word of life" -- that is a living expression in a Man of what life is according to God, and he says, "We have seen and bear witness, and report to you the eternal life, which was with the Father, and has been manifested to us.<a name=62:2></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.A.<a name=62:3></a>L.<a name=62:4></a> Does it not, therefore, greatly help to see set forth in Jesus in all His relationships down here in manhood, just exactly that kind of life that was in the mind of God for us from eternity?<a name=62:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=62:6></a>G.<a name=62:7></a> Yes, I think so.<a name=62:8></a> Not that eternal life covers all the activities of the Lord as Man here, because of course there is the way He filled out the details of ordinary human life in perfection as typified in the manna, and there is what He was in public testimony before men, meeting hostility and so on, but eternal life was really the spring, so to speak, of His movements.<a name=62:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G.A.<a name=62:10></a>L.<a name=62:11></a> I was thinking of what the word says, "and we have seen, and bear witness, and report to you the eternal life, which was with the Father, and has been manifested to us.<a name=62:12></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=62:13></a>G.<a name=62:14></a> Yes, quite so, they could take account of it, that all His springs, you might say, were in the Father, and His life was lived in relation to the Father.<a name=62:15></a>

		E.J.<a name=62:16></a>H.<a name=62:17></a> Is it the thought of what was seen there substantially in Christ?<a name=62:18></a> So that it says, "<i>that which</i> was from the beginning.<a name=62:19></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=63:1></a>G.<a name=63:2></a> Yes.<a name=63:3></a> I think that is most important, it is not quite the presentation of the Lord in His Person (though of course that is involved), but rather the substantiality of what was there, it was the "Word of life.<a name=63:4></a>" The gospel presents Him as the Word, the One in whom personally the mind of God is conveyed to us, but the epistle presents Him as "the Word of life," the One in whom life in its substantiality and characteristics were set out.<a name=63:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=63:10></a>G.<a name=63:11></a> I do not know that one can say much in the way of drawing a distinction.<a name=63:12></a> I think we can see that "we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:14">John  1:14</a>) is stressing what is unique and beautiful in the sense of a relationship of love, and it was unique to Him, too, "A glory as of an only-begotten with a father.<a name=63:13></a>" At the same time, I think that all enters into this thought of the "Word of life.<a name=63:14></a>" It was with the Father, that is to say, as I understand it, it was the character of the life that was lived in relation to the Father.<a name=63:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		H.D.<a name=63:16></a>T.<a name=63:17></a> So that that in itself gave rise to all the Lord's activities in the testimony and His movements amongst men, the spring of it all was, may we say reverently, His life with the Father.<a name=63:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=63:19></a>G.<a name=63:20></a> That is what I thought.<a name=63:21></a> So that there is a verse at the end of one of the later chapters in Luke's gospel that by day He was teaching in the temple and by night he went out and was abroad on the mount of Olives, as though suggesting that the life of the Lord here was made up of those two things -- the public position of testimony amongst

		G.A.<a name=64:2></a>L.<a name=64:3></a> Must that not always be the case in any service or ministry?<a name=64:4></a> Is not what lies behind in our relationships with God much more important in a certain sense than the ministry itself, because if that is missing the ministry is worthless?<a name=64:5></a>

		A.J.<a name=64:6></a>G.<a name=64:7></a> Exactly.<a name=64:8></a> Then it is not given to all to minister, that is a matter of sovereignty, but it is given to all to have part in life.<a name=64:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=64:12></a>G.<a name=64:13></a> Yes, I am sure it does.<a name=64:14></a> So that in the passage we read in chapter 2 the fathers are addressed as having known Him that is from the beginning, and that being characteristic of them, the apostle did not find it necessary to say any more to them, save what he says to all the saints, "and now, children, abide in him.<a name=64:15></a>"

	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ as Man here.<a name=65:1></a> That is what is in mind, it is from the beginning.<a name=65:2></a> The whole point in the epistle is that, in the days in which the apostle was writing, there were many Antichrists and many who were bringing in what was false; hence the apostle insists that the saints must keep before them what was from the beginning, that is, what appeared in Christ as Man here as the expression and standard of Christianity according to God's thoughts.<a name=65:3></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		A.J.<a name=91:1></a>G.<a name=91:2></a> This chapter 3 of the epistle brings out the two generations which are on the earth, that is, those who are children of God as begotten of God, and those who are the children of the devil.<a name=91:3></a> There is the circle or system, in a moral sense, connected with each; the circle of the brethren, on the one hand, where love obtains, and the world on the other hand which lies in the wicked one; the first circle marked by life and the other by death.<a name=91:4></a> So that in verse 14 it says, "we know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren"; and the two are opposed the one to the other.<a name=91:5></a> Chapter 5 brings in the thought of victory over the world.<a name=91:6></a> The passage we have read in chapter 3 is engaged with our knowing and persuading our hearts; that is, proving the reality of Christianity as allowing the truth to govern us and form us, and especially righteousness and love.<a name=91:7></a> Righteousness, in a practical sense, and love, are the outstanding features of the children of God; and in this passage we are urged to allow love to work out practically; first as learning it in Christ, as it says, "hereby we have known love, because he has laid down his life for us," and then as learning to practise it.<a name=91:8></a> By this means we assure our hearts; it says, we persuade our hearts.<a name=91:9></a> So that the reality of the truth is proved and confirmed to us as we walk in it.<a name=91:10></a> It is striking that in verse 23 of chapter 3 we have a commandment, the idea of commandment being what God insists on, what He lays down as particularly for our good, that we are commanded to "believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and that we love one another," which links with what we had at the outset, the importance of active faith with

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.J.<a name=92:3></a>H.<a name=92:4></a> Verse 16 is not put on the basis of privilege or of being voluntary, but it is placed upon the basis of obligation.<a name=92:5></a> Is that what you have in mind in referring to the commandment, that it should be done?<a name=92:6></a> It is, "we <i>ought</i> for the brethren to lay down our lives.<a name=92:7></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=92:8></a>G.<a name=92:9></a> Yes, and I think as confirming us ourselves God has in mind that we should prove the power of Christianity; and then as moving in it in power there should be undeniable testimony in days when apostasy is increasing.<a name=92:10></a> So it is love that we have known, and not specifically the love of Christ, although it is the love of Christ, but it is love which is of God, as come into perfect expression in Christ.<a name=92:11></a> We learn it there, and then it is to work out in ourselves.<a name=92:12></a>

		G.A.<a name=92:13></a>L.<a name=92:14></a> So that God being known in that way every thought is held as binding on the saints.<a name=92:15></a> I was thinking of the Lord Jesus Himself.<a name=92:16></a> "This commandment have I received of my Father.<a name=92:17></a>" The Father's desire and thought in that sense was binding upon the Lord Jesus in love, was it not?<a name=92:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=92:19></a>G.<a name=92:20></a> Quite so.<a name=92:21></a> It is of great importance to realise that it is the truth that is in question ever since Satan introduced the lie into the heart of the woman, and then of the man; the truth as to God has been at issue and the saints now, as begotten of God, are to stand in it and walk in it.<a name=92:22></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=93:7></a>G.<a name=93:8></a> Yes.<a name=93:9></a> It is a commandment.<a name=93:10></a> I think it is well to take note of this first part of the commandment that we should believe on the name of His Son, Jesus Christ, that we should be characteristically believers on the name of God's Son, Jesus Christ, all the renown that attaches to Him, because it opens up another world, another sphere altogether.<a name=93:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=93:20></a>G.<a name=93:21></a> I think it is His death that is in view, that He has laid down His life for us.<a name=93:22></a> I think laying down the life is regarded as the full extent to which love goes.<a name=93:23></a> So that Paul says that he always bore about in his body the dying of Jesus; that is to say, he was carrying the sense of it in his soul and that strengthened him to continue on the line of serving the saints even to the extent of laying down <i>his</i> life for them, if needs be.<a name=93:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=95:5></a>G.<a name=95:6></a> I think so.<a name=95:7></a> It has in mind that we are to be confirmed in the truth.<a name=95:8></a> "Hereby we shall know that we are of the truth and shall persuade our hearts before him.<a name=95:9></a>" The whole point in the epistle seems to be a confirmatory idea that we may know that we have eternal life and prove the power of Christianity.<a name=95:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.McK.<a name=95:11></a> You referred to the idea of being begotten of God; is that the idea that we are made partakers of the divine nature, and is it a matter of that nature having full liberty in this system?<a name=95:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=95:13></a>G.<a name=95:14></a> Yes, I think so, and the brethren are the circle in which it is to develop.<a name=95:15></a> We are not exactly called upon or regarded as loving men; we show grace to men as God does; but it is in the circle of the brethren that love is to be developed.<a name=95:16></a> So that God provided Cain with a brother, a brother Abel, and Abel loved Cain, for God told Cain that his desire would be toward him.<a name=95:17></a>

		E.J.<a name=95:18></a>H.<a name=95:19></a> Does not God say to Moses, "Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother?<a name=95:20></a> I know that he can speak well; and also behold, he goeth out to meet thee; and when he seeth thee he will be glad in his heart.<a name=95:21></a>" God put a brother in touch with one who is to be His servant, and they laboured together in the truth.<a name=95:22></a>

		A.J.<a name=99:7></a>G.<a name=99:8></a> I think it is.<a name=99:9></a> Here this epistle seems to work out that we are our brother's keeper, so that in the earlier part of the chapter, in verse 17, it says, "whoso may have the world's substance, and see his brother having need, and shut up his bowels from him .<a name=99:10></a>.<a name=99:11></a>.<a name=99:12></a> .<a name=99:13></a>" That is, we have our eyes open to the physical needs of our brethren.<a name=99:14></a> Then in chapter 5 we have our eyes open to their moral needs; verse 16 says, "if any one see his brother sinning a sin not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life, for those that do not sin unto death.<a name=99:15></a>" So that there is the practical setting out that we are, in fact, our brother's keeper.<a name=99:16></a> It is remarkable how much details of the incident of Cain and Abel, if looked into, are worked out in this epistle.<a name=99:17></a>

		A.J.<a name=137:18></a>G.<a name=137:19></a> I was thinking in relation to <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3">Ephesians  3</a>; it is a scripture which we often dwell upon, but we get the Spirit brought in here in order to fill out the thoughts of God regarding the assembly, but brought in in the character of the Father's Spirit, so that the Christ might dwell, through faith, in our hearts, and that we might be able fully to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height.<a name=137:20></a> That is to say, the Spirit as the Spirit of God's Son capacitates us to respond to the Father suitably in affections and feelings of Christ, but now the Spirit as the Father's Spirit, enables us to enter sympathetically, you might say, into His own thoughts and outlook; His own appreciation of the Christ, and His own outlook upon the whole extent of glory which He is bringing in.<a name=137:21></a>

		A.J.<a name=142:6></a>G.<a name=142:7></a> Well, I suppose the fulness of God is the way that God is known.<a name=142:8></a> That is, it is the way God has come out in expression.<a name=142:9></a> There is that about God, of course, which the creature can never know, but there is the way He has come out within the range of the creature and what He capacitates the creature to know, and, I suppose, it is involved in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.<a name=142:10></a> So that when we are brought into these things in some degree, we apprehend the Father as supreme in the economy, and that Name giving character to all, but we also apprehend the part that has been taken by the Son and is filled by the Son, and the part taken by the Spirit and that is filled by the Spirit; so that you are in the presence, it seems to me, of the fulness of God, and you are, to some extent, made equal to it.<a name=142:11></a> I do not know that one can say very much about it, but the fulness of God, it seems to me, is love in the wondrousness of its actings, adapting itself to the creature and adapting the creature to it.<a name=142:12></a>

		I wish, dear brethren, to direct your attention to the movements of Christ as they are set before us in this passage, involving love to His own and love to God, believing that, as we are impressed with these movements and rightly affected by them, it will work out in the strengthening of our position here in testimony and also in increased freshness and substance in the service of God.<a name=143:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are greatly privileged in that at the present time the testimony is entrusted to us, in the charge of the Holy Spirit, and the service of God, is also, you might say, entrusted to us, although it is in the hands of the Lord Jesus as the Minister of the sanctuary, and also in the hands of the Holy Spirit.<a name=143:3></a> But I mean it is a great privilege to realise that to us who are but men, God's creatures, He is pleased to give this double privilege of being in a world of evil in the maintenance of the true expression of Himself, and also of affording Him pleasure unceasingly as ministering to His heart.<a name=143:4></a>

		but He is pleased to meet the challenge and take it up and solve every issue that is raised in man.<a name=144:1></a> Primarily, of course, He solves these issues in Christ, as we shall see, but then they are also to be worked out in the power of the Holy Spirit in the saints.<a name=144:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in this chapter 13 the Lord contemplates that He is about to depart out of the world to the Father.<a name=144:3></a> There is a striking majesty about the movements of Christ as we have them presented to us in John's gospel.<a name=144:4></a> He is not presented as being slain and cast out, He is presented as departing out of the world to the Father, and departing at the right time.<a name=144:5></a> Nothing that man could do could alter the time.<a name=144:6></a> The time had come, His hour had come that He should depart out of this world to the Father.<a name=144:7></a> So that as we follow the movements of Christ in the gospel of John we are impressed with the wondrous deliberateness in all those movements; the whole matter being in the divine mind and being carried out steadily by the Lord Jesus without being deflected or hindered; all is done perfectly and to time.<a name=144:8></a> But now the time having come when He should depart out of the world to the Father.<a name=144:9></a> He has in view His own who are to be left in the world.<a name=144:10></a> That is a very touching thing for us to remember, for the Lord has been in this very world and knows its character, and what its influences are and how active Satan is; and knowing all about it He takes account of His own, as He calls us, who should be in the world, and takes occasion, as it says, to love them to the end.<a name=144:11></a> Not that He had not always loved His own, but it is as though the Spirit of God would impress us with the sense that in view of the position which was to arise by reason of His departing out of the world and His own being left in the world, He set Himself deliberately to love them to the end.<a name=144:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence that is one thing, dear brethren, that we can always rely upon, the love of Christ.<a name=144:13></a> As Paul
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=145>[Page 145]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		says, "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?<a name=145:1></a>" Paul proved it in a remarkable degree that nothing and no one could separate him from the love of Christ.<a name=145:2></a> That is something for us to take account of, that whatever arises we may rely on the faithfulness and the power and the service of the love of Christ, because another thing comes into view and that is that Satan is very near.<a name=145:3></a> It is a feature of this chapter that the devil is near; he had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariote, one of the twelve, to betray the Lord.<a name=145:4></a> He was there present on this occasion, one of the twelve, with that thought in his heart, put there by the devil, that he should betray the Lord; and later on in the chapter the devil enters into him.<a name=145:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So we are reminded that that is the situation, the Lord departing out of the world, His own left <i>in</i> the world and the devil very near and very active; and the sorrowful thing is that there should be one of those who outwardly belonged to Christ -- he was not a real disciple though he had that position -- that there should be one who opened his heart to the devil.<a name=145:6></a> We are told in the previous chapter what the secret was; we are told that Judas was a thief and had the bag and carried what was put in it; and therefore for a trifling sum of money, covetousness having taken possession of his heart, he was prepared to betray the Son of God.<a name=145:7></a> It shows how watchful we need to be that we should not allow in our hearts the beginnings of anything that is contrary to the truth, because in the measure in which we do we are exposing ourselves to the attack of the devil.<a name=145:8></a> Let us not forget that the devil is near and that he is bent upon spoiling, if he can, and to what extent he can, what is of God down here, and that we expose ourselves to his attack if we allow in our hearts or minds anything that is contrary to the truth.<a name=145:9></a> Hence the very beginnings of things are to be judged if we

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the devil was near, and it says that, "Jesus, knowing that the Father had given him all things into his hands, and that he came out from God and was going to God.<a name=146:2></a>" How much is comprised in those few words!<a name=146:3></a> He came out from God in order to bring God out in full declaration and to bring out all that was in the mind of God to establish in the way of blessing; and He was going to God.<a name=146:4></a> First He must lay the basis for everything in His death, but all is put in that wonderful way that one of the Godhead had come in in manhood, going through with every thought of the blessed God, and He was going to carry everything right through and secure the full answer to all that God had purposed in His love.<a name=146:5></a> He came from God and was going to God, and He was in the full consciousness of that, and in the full consciousness, too, that the Father had given Him all things into His hands.<a name=146:6></a> Being fully conscious of that, with all the moral glory that attaches to One to whom such great things are committed, He "rises from supper and lays aside his garments, and having taken a linen towel he girded himself.<a name=146:7></a>" He had in mind, as we know well, to set an example of how love acts; He had in mind that an example of love in its actings, and not merely as an abstraction, should be left in the company of His own, and be impressed upon every one who was present.<a name=146:8></a> Only eleven were impressionable, but the Lord intended that all the eleven who were impressionable should take on the impression of love in the way it acts as He was now setting before them.<a name=146:9></a> I need not say that everything that Jesus did is enhanced by the glory of His Person.<a name=146:10></a> So that it says at the end of John's gospel, "And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which if they were written one by one, I suppose

		that not even the world itself would contain the books written.<a name=147:1></a>" They were all of such value that they were worthy to be written one by one; but written books are not capable, they are not sufficient, the world itself could not contain the books that should be written if all the things that Jesus did were written one by one.<a name=147:2></a> There was a moral glory attaching to every one of them.<a name=147:3></a> But in the assembly, the body of Christ, the things that Jesus did are now being repeated, you might say, are now being worked out under His own influence in those who are the members of His body; so that the whole assembly, the body in its entirety, is the vessel in which the things that Jesus did in the moral glory of them will appear in a coming day.<a name=147:4></a>

		So, as I was saying, everything that Jesus did was enhanced by the glory of the One who did them, and here there is the expression and the example of serving love.<a name=147:5></a> No one is asked to get things ready for Him, no one is too unimportant to be served by Him; He does everything Himself and does it in the conscious dignity of His Person and of all that was entrusted to Him.<a name=147:6></a> He rises from supper, He lays aside His garments, as though to divest Himself of anything that would attach official importance to Him, He takes a linen towel.<a name=147:7></a> "He rises from supper and lays aside his garments, and having taken a linen towel He girded himself," that is, He deliberately assumed a bondman's service, "Then he pours water into the wash-hand basin, and began to wash the feet of the disciples, and to wipe them with the linen towel with which he was girded.<a name=147:8></a>" There can be no doubt that He went round the whole circle.<a name=147:9></a> It says, "He comes therefore to Simon Peter"; there is nothing to suggest that He went directly and immediately to Simon Peter; in the course of going round the circle He comes to Simon Peter, and at the end it says, "When therefore, he had washed <i>their</i> feet.<a name=147:10></a>"

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So that we are to gather that He went round the whole circle, every one of His own receiving this personal service from the Lord Himself.<a name=148:1></a> But what has all this in mind?<a name=148:2></a> It has in mind, dear brethren, that we should learn love in its practical working and in its impartiality, love that takes account of every one in the circle.<a name=148:3></a> We were saying this afternoon that the working out of love is largely left to the localities.<a name=148:4></a> Of course, wherever we meet the saints they are an object of love to us and can be served in love; but the practical working out and development of love amongst ourselves really in the last resort works out in the local company, and this is to instruct us that everyone is to be regarded as an object of care and worthy to be served.<a name=148:5></a> The one who washes the feet goes down lower than all.<a name=148:6></a> What a help this will be in the conditions locally, dear brethren, if we begin to take on this spirit that has been set out in Jesus, "Least of all," as it says elsewhere, "and servant of all.<a name=148:7></a>" There is plenty of room for such; there is not much room for those who desire to be something, like Simon Magus who gave out that he was some great one.<a name=148:8></a> There is plenty of room for any of us if we are prepared to be least of all and servant of all; and that attitude of mind and the service that results from it have been dignified by being exemplified in the Son of God.<a name=148:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not know that I need enlarge further on this.<a name=148:10></a> The Spirit of God records the incident through John and he records it in great detail.<a name=148:11></a> I think we may assume that John, as we may say, was spellbound as he saw the Lord moving in this wonderful way, because every movement of His is recorded; how He rises from supper and how He lays aside His garments and how He took a linen towel and how He girded Himself and how He poured water into a wash-hand basin and how He began to wash the feet of the disciples and to wipe them with the towel with which
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=149>[Page 149]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He was girded, and how He took again His garments; all is recorded.<a name=149:1></a> If we had been recording it, the probability is that we would not have recorded all these details; but every detail has its value as we see who it was who was moving in this way.<a name=149:2></a> He was not asking anyone to do part of the labour.<a name=149:3></a> He was doing it all Himself and the least of the twelve was equally served as much as the greatest.<a name=149:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So He tells us what He has in mind.<a name=149:5></a> He says, "Ye call me the Teacher and the Lord, and ye say well, for I am so.<a name=149:6></a> If I therefore, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another's feet; for I have given you an example that, as I have done to you, ye should do also.<a name=149:7></a>" That is, He is setting in motion this great idea of love amongst ourselves and showing that it is not to be a theory but it is to work out in actual expression, and the expression of it is in love that serves.<a name=149:8></a> Just as Abigail, to whom we have often referred, when she heard that she was to become the wife of David in his rejection, said, "Behold, let thy handmaid be a bondwoman to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.<a name=149:9></a>" She understood that the time of David's rejection was a time when those who were with him would need refreshing, and she was content to take her place as a bondwoman, having no aspirations beyond that that she should be privileged to wash the feet of the servants of her Lord.<a name=149:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Peter objects, as we know.<a name=149:11></a> In this chapter Peter is twice in the wrong simply because he had himself before him; either mock-humility, saying, "Thou shalt never wash my feet," or else self-importance saying "Lord, why cannot I follow thee now"?<a name=149:12></a> It is astonishing -- let everyone allow his own heart to bear testimony -- how much self intrudes itself in our thoughts and exercises, and this chapter shows how self can be a real hindrance to the entrance upon the thoughts of God.<a name=149:13></a> So the Lord answers
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=150>[Page 150]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Peter's objections by saying, "Unless I wash thee, thou hast not part with me.<a name=150:1></a>" Who raised the suggestion about part with Christ?<a name=150:2></a> It did not come from Peter; it did not come, as far as we know, from John; it did not come from anyone but the Lord Himself.<a name=150:3></a> He has that in mind in His service toward us in love, that we should have part with Himself.<a name=150:4></a> There is scarcely anything more affecting than that.<a name=150:5></a> John seems to have taken on the idea, for later on in the chapter he is seen in the bosom of Jesus; he understands that the Lord wants him to be near Him, not active in service, but near the Lord.<a name=150:6></a> Service has its due place with those to whom it is given to serve, but service that love dictates is open to anyone, and real service proceeds from nearness to Christ.<a name=150:7></a> So John understands something of what was in the Lord's mind when He alludes to "part with me," so we find him in the bosom of Jesus.<a name=150:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I pass on to verses 31 and 32.<a name=150:9></a> The first passage that I have been dwelling on has in mind that we should be really marked by love amongst ourselves, and that is an important feature as strengthening the position of testimony.<a name=150:10></a> It says, "Jerusalem .<a name=150:11></a>.<a name=150:12></a>.<a name=150:13></a> is a city that is compact together," <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#122:3">Psalm  122:3</a>.<a name=150:14></a> If the saints are moving together in the love that is learned from Christ, the enemy will find it very difficult to get in, and hence the great importance of this idea of being compact together in our several localities, because there is nothing that will so keep the enemy out as the saints being truly together.<a name=150:15></a> The service of love begets confidence, and confidence begets openness, and the more love is in activity the more there are conditions in which Satan finds it difficult to get in.<a name=150:16></a> So love will be always on the watch also, as we were having this afternoon, "If any one see his brother sinning a sin not unto death, he shall ask.<a name=150:17></a>" Love has its eyes open and love, you might say, has its knees ready.<a name=150:18></a> "If any one sees his brother sinning
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=151>[Page 151]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		a sin not unto death, he shall ask.<a name=151:1></a>" So that love is always ready to take up the cause of anyone who for the moment appears to have come under the influence of evil.<a name=151:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So as I was saying, this great thought of love amongst ourselves is an important element in the strengthening of the position here in testimony.<a name=151:3></a> But now we come to these verses 31 and 32, and the Lord says, "Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.<a name=151:4></a>" This, you might say, is the central point of two eternities, if one may use the expression.<a name=151:5></a> That is, speaking according to human ways of expression, time is an interlude or interval between eternity that has gone before and eternity that is to follow.<a name=151:6></a> I realise that it is a human way of expression, but Scripture speaks of "from eternity to eternity.<a name=151:7></a>" But here the cross is in view and it is the central point of everything -- the cross.<a name=151:8></a> Behind the cross lies the marvel of the incarnation, but the cross is the great point at which every issue raised by the introduction of sin has been solved according to God, and in addition love has come out in glorious expression there.<a name=151:9></a> It is the glory of the Son of man that God has been glorified; as I was saying earlier, the issues that have been raised by the introduction of sin God has taken up in man, but it is in the Son of man; it is in the Son of man primarily that they are taken up, and only by the Son of Man could all that was effected at the cross be effected.<a name=151:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the Lord is speaking of the cross.<a name=151:11></a> The moment had now come, it was immediately before His spirit.<a name=151:12></a> Not exactly the sorrow of it; we get a suggestion of Gethsemane, the nearest approach to it in this gospel, in chapter 12, where He says, "Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say?<a name=151:13></a> Father, save me from this hour.<a name=151:14></a> But on account of this have I come to this hour.<a name=151:15></a> Father, glorify thy name.<a name=151:16></a>" How good it is to follow the movements of Christ and the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		words of Jesus, to see the motives that impelled Him in His service.<a name=152:1></a> "Father, glorify thy name.<a name=152:2></a>" There was one Man come forth in Jesus whose one thought was that God should be glorified, that every challenge that had been raised by the introduction of sin should be fully met and in result God should remain supreme in the affections of His creature.<a name=152:3></a> And now the time had come for this to be done.<a name=152:4></a> Sin had come in, the creature upon whom God had set His heart had become estranged from Him, it looked as though the devil had won the day.<a name=152:5></a> And now there is this wonderful movement on the part of the Son of man, and at the cross sin is judged according to divine standards of holiness.<a name=152:6></a> What a wonderful thing that is!<a name=152:7></a> Not judged in those who were sinners but judged in the Person of the Son of man, as it says in another scripture, "Him who knew not sin he has made sin for us.<a name=152:8></a>" Is it possible to fathom it?<a name=152:9></a> We may, at any rate, contemplate it.<a name=152:10></a> It gives us an impression of the wonderful way in which every issue raised by the introduction of sin has been met by God Himself in the Person of His Son, but it involved infinite cost for Christ and for God too.<a name=152:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now the time had come for it to be done, and it was the glory of the Son of man that He should do it.<a name=152:12></a> Sin was judged in a most absolute way; all that was due to God was met and His throne and nature abundantly vindicated, and at the same time a way cleared, by this wonderful road that love has taken, whereby we might be saved.<a name=152:13></a> It is a question not only of holiness being vindicated but of love being expressed, as the hymn puts it.<a name=152:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<blockquote>"Love, that on death's dark vale <br>Its sweetest odours spread; <br>Where sin o'er all seemed to prevail, <br>Redemption's glory shed.<a name=152:16></a><a name=152:15></a>" (<a href=".<a name=152:17></a>.<a name=152:18></a>\hymns\hymns1972.<a name=152:19></a>htm#235:4">Hymn 235</a>)</blockquote>

		He is able to meet <i>any</i> situation and does it consistently with Himself, and shines out in a glory that was never known before, the glory of love in redemption.<a name=153:1></a> But Jesus was needed if it was to be done, and so it says, "Now is the Son of man glorified and God is glorified in him.<a name=153:2></a>" And therefore, in the light of the cross of Christ we become affected more and more by love.<a name=153:3></a> It is not only the way that Christ serves us that impresses us, according to the first part of the chapter, but we become affected by the wondrousness of love in redemption, and at the same time we get a wonderful standard, a perfect standard of holiness.<a name=153:4></a> We learn to judge sin as God has judged it, but we learn to rejoice in the love that has found a way of saving us and making us suitable to itself.<a name=153:5></a> It involves not only redemption but the gift of the Spirit.<a name=153:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But here the Lord is speaking about this moment of the cross.<a name=153:7></a> "Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.<a name=153:8></a> If God be glorified in him, God also shall glorify him in himself," that is, as I understand it, in God; the Lord Jesus is not for the moment glorified publicly but He has been exalted to the right hand of God and God is for the moment keeping Him out of sight.<a name=153:9></a> The moment for His public glory is coming soon, but He is glorified in God, He has not had to wait for that.<a name=153:10></a> Now that being accomplished, God is left free to open up what He has had in His mind all along from before the foundation of the world.<a name=153:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So we find the Lord is moving still; He moved to exemplify love amongst His own.<a name=153:12></a> He moved in His thoughts to the cross, and now He speaks of further movement.<a name=153:13></a> He says, "Ye shall seek me; and, as I said to the Jews, Where I go ye cannot come, I say to you also now.<a name=153:14></a>" Now Simon Peter again intervenes and says, "Lord, where goest thou?<a name=153:15></a>" and Jesus says, "Where I go thou canst not follow me now,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		but thou shalt follow me <i>after</i>.<a name=154:1></a>" That is, the Lord must go first.<a name=154:2></a> In the first part of the chapter Peter has to learn that he must allow the Lord to serve him, he must allow the Lord to set the example of love; but now he is to learn that the Lord must go first; he is to follow after, as we all are, but the Lord must go first, and we will learn our place as we follow the Lord in His movements.<a name=154:3></a> Peter says, "Why cannot I follow thee now?<a name=154:4></a> I will lay down my life for thee.<a name=154:5></a>" Full of himself, full of self-importance, even occupied with his devotedness to Christ!<a name=154:6></a> What a snare self is!<a name=154:7></a> The only thing that will eclipse self is Christ, and the Spirit of God is given us to that end that self should be eclipsed by the appreciation of Christ.<a name=154:8></a> So the Lord has to say to Peter, "Thou wilt lay down thy life for me!<a name=154:9></a> Verily, verily, I say to thee, The cock shall not crow till thou hast denied me thrice.<a name=154:10></a>" What a lesson Peter had to learn!<a name=154:11></a> What lessons we all have to learn!<a name=154:12></a> Believers have to learn what the heart is capable of, what self-confidence will lead to, what boastfulness will lead to.<a name=154:13></a> All these things have to be learnt, and why do they have to be learned?<a name=154:14></a> In order that we should have no confidence in ourselves, as Paul says, in the epistle to the Philippians, "For we are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God, and boast in Christ Jesus, and do not trust in flesh" -- no room for the flesh at all.<a name=154:15></a> We "worship by the Spirit of God," God is before us in His blessedness, the power for the worship being the Spirit of God, and we boast in Christ Jesus, the Man of God's choice, and we have no confidence in the flesh, and that is the happy portion of the believer.<a name=154:16></a> So Peter has to learn it, he has to learn what he is in his own untrustworthiness; but the result of it is that he will learn to appreciate Christ more, and learn to appreciate the Spirit more, and learn to fill out the rest of his time here in distrust of self and in confidence

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So all this is intended to provide substance in our souls as we increase in the knowledge of God; God Himself is to be the object before our hearts, the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.<a name=155:3></a> I believe God is making Himself indispensable to us, and intends to; He intends all the exercises connected with our position here in testimony, and all the exercises that arise in connection with filling out the position of the service of God acceptably in the assembly, to make God Himself, the Father and the Son and the Spirit, indispensable to us, that there should be no room for ourselves; yet it is ourselves having part in these wonderful things in the liberty of sonship, but it is intended that we should be shut up to the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, that we should be satisfied with God.<a name=155:4></a> And the more we learn God, the more there will be real power for worship in the assembly.<a name=155:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the ground being cleared, according to what the Lord says in verses 31 and 32, the Lord is now free to open out what is connected with the Father's purpose.<a name=155:6></a> So He says, "Let not your heart be troubled.<a name=155:7></a>" It is as though the whole position has been met and we can now rest, so to speak, in God and in Christ, and in the Spirit too, for what we have to learn as to ourselves does not in any sense affect what it is that God is bringing in now, and to which we are called.<a name=155:8></a> So the Lord says, "Let not your heart be troubled; ye believe on God, believe also on me.<a name=155:9></a>" That is, Christ Himself is now to be kept steadily before our hearts.<a name=155:10></a> As we were having this afternoon, that is God's <i>commandment</i> that we believe on the name of His Son.<a name=155:11></a> Jesus Christ, all the renown that

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord does not present Himself as supreme in relation to this.<a name=157:9></a> He says, "My <i>Father's</i> house"; He is directing attention to His Father, as He says later on in this chapter, "My Father is greater than I.<a name=157:10></a>" He presents the Father as the great source of all these great thoughts of love.<a name=157:11></a> He is the One Himself who effectuates them, and the Spirit makes it good in us and gives us power to enter into them and move in them in the liberty that is proper to us; but the great source of all is the Father, God known in the blessedness of that name as Father.<a name=157:12></a> So, as our thoughts and hearts come under the impress of these things, as we learn them in the movements of Christ, we become freshly impressed with the wondrous grace in which God is known by us at the present time.<a name=157:13></a> Not now grace connected with the meeting of need, though great grace has been called into activity in the doing of that, but grace that is pleased to give His creature man <i>such a place</i> in nearness to Himself, in union with Christ, and indwelt by the Holy Spirit.<a name=157:14></a> It is as though we are embraced in God; it is a question of God and the blessedness of God and love that is in God in designing these things and bringing them to pass so that we might have our part through grace in the

		A.J.<a name=175:1></a>G.<a name=175:2></a> I think it is clear that this 13th chapter commences a final section of the gospel, so that it begins with "Jesus, knowing that his hour had come that he should depart out of this world to the Father.<a name=175:3></a>" That is that the moment had now arrived for what was final in the mind of God to come in; because Christianity is the greatest thing that the heart of God has devised, involving the most wonderful place for men -- that is for those of the assembly in relation to God known as Father -- and the hour for this had now arrived; and what is to be noticed, I think, is that everything is in the Lord's hands, so that the more we dwell on these chapters, the more we get a sense of great stability and great certainty and that everything is in the Lord's hands, and not only so but the Lord knows everything.<a name=175:4></a> At the end of chapter 16 the disciples come to Him and say, "Now we know that thou knowest all things" (verse 30), showing that they had arrived at that point.<a name=175:5></a> I believe that what was now to open up in the Lord Himself finds its answer in the point we have now reached in the history of the assembly, that we have arrived at some sense of the immensity of what God has brought in in Christ and the Spirit; and arrived at a sense, too, of great certainty and stability, that everything is in the Lord's hands and that He knows everything, and though Satan is near -- and will be near until the Lord takes us to Himself -- yet even Satan is in the Lord's hand, so that the Lord says to Judas, "What thou doest do quickly.<a name=175:6></a>" The whole matter is under divine control, and if Satan is allowed to be near, yet, if we are with Christ, we shall find that

		even his activities only work out to bring the truth into fuller and more glorious display.<a name=176:1></a> So this chapter not only presents the Lord to us in a very attractive way as knowing everything and conscious of the Father having given all things into His hands, and that He comes from God and goes to God, but it also gives us the final solution of every issue in the glorifying of God in verse 31, and then the opening up in chapter 14 of the economy, you might say, leading up to a kind of climax in the word we finished with, where it says, "In that day" -- that is the Spirit's day -- "ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.<a name=176:2></a>" There is an immensity of wealth in that verse that, I think, grows upon us as we think about it.<a name=176:3></a>

		Coming to these chapters we have read, it is clear that it is now a question of our position in testimony, but the Lord seems to indicate that underlying testimony is fruit bearing.<a name=199:18></a> The spring of all true testimony is consideration for God, and what will afford pleasure to God, and hence the necessity of learning everything from Christ and abiding in Him.<a name=199:19></a> The second thing is that in chapter 16 the Lord stresses the place the Spirit has in relation to it, as though the Spirit takes charge of the whole position; so that the Lord says, "When <i>he</i> is come, the Spirit of truth, he shall guide you into all the truth," and "Having come, <i>he</i> will bring demonstration to the world, of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment," and so on.<a name=199:20></a> There is the emphatic word "<i>He</i>.<a name=199:21></a>" <i>He</i> would guide into all the truth and glorify Christ.<a name=199:22></a>

		A.J.<a name=222:1></a>G.<a name=222:2></a> I suppose everybody recognises the unique character of this chapter, which arises from the fact that it is the Son who is addressing the Father, so that there are no limitations.<a name=222:3></a> The Lord in speaking to the disciples in the previous chapters would necessarily be, to some extent, limited by the capacity of the disciples, but now, in speaking to the Father, no such limitations arise; so that the chapter has a unique character, in that the Son's desires come out in full expression, in a wonderfully compressed way, too.<a name=222:4></a> The great desire that the Father should be glorified comes out at once, in the Lord saying, "Glorify thy Son, that thy Son may glorify thee," that being the great end.<a name=222:5></a> Then the principal part of this prayer of the Lord is concerned first with the disciples, and then with those who should believe on Him "through their word," and that as left in this world in testimony they should be kept, special stress being laid on sanctification and on unity, and then leading on at the end to the most precious desires expressed by the Son in relation to His own, verses 24 and 26 especially bringing in what is extremely important and blessed.<a name=222:6></a>

		A.J.<a name=224:17></a>G.<a name=224:18></a> Yes, that is greatly stressed, and I think that is something that perhaps the Lord is impressing upon us, because, in our distinction that we rightly make between the Persons of the Godhead and Their respective glories and activities, there is a danger of unconsciously losing sight of the oneness of the Godhead.<a name=224:19></a> So, in these chapters, the Lord twice says, "I am in the Father and the Father in me," and then again, "Thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee," in order to keep the balance of things in our minds, I believe.<a name=224:20></a>

		A.J.<a name=300:1></a>G.<a name=300:2></a> The last two verses of chapter 20 seem to bring the book to a conclusion, but then this chapter is added as a kind of appendix.<a name=300:3></a> I think one can see that the gospel would not be complete without it.<a name=300:4></a> In chapter 20 we have been led right up to the highest thoughts of God in Christianity -- the greatest spiritual privileges of the assembly and what constitutes our eternal portion, but then in actual fact what the history of the assembly shows, and what our own history will bear witness to, is that we are dependent on the grace of Christ, the gracious service of Christ, to bring us into these things, and to recover us to them if there is at times a measure of departure.<a name=300:5></a> So that the gospel seems to finish on that note, a kind of filling out of what we had in chapter 13, that "Jesus .<a name=300:6></a>.<a name=300:7></a>.<a name=300:8></a> having loved his own who were in the world, loved them to the end.<a name=300:9></a>" Whatever arises in the history of the saints, what secures completion is the love of Christ and its service.<a name=300:10></a> So that there is a further manifestation of Jesus; it says, "After these things Jesus manifested himself again," and then "He manifested himself thus.<a name=300:11></a>" No doubt the incident has a certain dispensational bearing but I do not know that we need occupy ourselves with that, but it is striking that it should be a manifestation in connection with certain conditions which obviously are not according to the Lord's mind.<a name=300:12></a> That is, there are seven disciples, not eleven, but seven of them.<a name=300:13></a> We have a kind of sectional or independent movement that does not embrace the whole; having its issue in one of them saying, "I go to fish," and the others saying "We also come

		with thee.<a name=301:1></a>" But what is so striking is that there is not a word of remonstrance or chiding on the part of the Lord, but the most touching expression of grace; bringing before them that He has His own system of warmth and food, and all is really to be connected with that and contributory to it.<a name=301:2></a> Then the chapter takes up Peter after that, as the personal object of the Lord's service so that he might be fully restored and set on lines on which he can go through to a conclusion that glorifies God; Peter being in that way, I believe, in these closing chapters of John's gospel, a little picture of the assembly in its responsible history, marked by breakdown and utter failure on the one hand, but recovered in the end to real faithfulness.<a name=301:3></a> Not that I am speaking, of course, of the outward public profession, but of what is to be seen practically at the end.<a name=301:4></a> Peter seems to come into accord with John; John going through, and Peter in the end glorifying God by his death.<a name=301:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=303:3></a>G.<a name=303:4></a> I think appearing seems to be the Lord bringing Himself deliberately before them in a particular light, but manifestation rather has in view the impression that was left on those to whom He appeared, so that the thought of manifestation occurs frequently in John's gospel.<a name=303:5></a> In chapter 14 the Lord says, "He that has my commandments and keeps them, <i>he</i> it is that loves me; but he that loves me shall be loved by my Father, and <i>I</i> will love him and will manifest myself to him" (verse 21), and then Judas, not Iscariote, takes up the question, "How is it that thou wilt manifest thyself to us and not to the world?<a name=303:6></a>" But the idea of manifestation has in view bringing some particular feature of His glory definitely into view.<a name=303:7></a>

		A.J.<a name=303:12></a>G.<a name=303:13></a> Yes, I think so.<a name=303:14></a> So the first was to bring out the full light of the heavenly position; the second, apart from this dispensational appearing, was to stress the matter of faith, "Blessed they who have not seen and have believed" (verse 29); and the third is to bring out this feature of His own love and the service of Christ, as that which is to go through to the end, notwithstanding the incidents that may arise in the responsible history of the assembly.<a name=303:15></a>

		A.J.<a name=304:18></a>G.<a name=304:19></a> In Cana of Galilee He "manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him" (chapter 2: 11), and I suppose that is a particular feature of His glory, not in a sense connected with His Person, though, of course, it is connected with His Person, but more what He can do; that He can bring in a spiritual order of things that eclipses the best of nature.<a name=304:20></a> But here it is a manifestation of Himself.<a name=304:21></a> It is, in a sense, what was necessary on account of the defection on the part of His own, and brings out the resources that are there in the love of Christ.<a name=304:22></a>

		What I desire to speak about is the substantial character of Christianity, that it is not merely a system of doctrine but it is something very concrete and substantial and is to be seen in the saints.<a name=324:2></a> That is why I have read these scriptures, because they will be found, I think, to indicate substantial features of the work of God appearing in one and another.<a name=324:3></a>

		We have been speaking this morning and this afternoon of the way God is known as He has come out in wonderful revelation, having constituted what we speak of as the economy, God being known in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, and the more we contemplate the economy, and the movements and services of the respective Persons of the Godhead, the more we are impressed with love, and that is what we might expect, for God is love, and the economy is simply the way that God has devised to bring His love in a tangible way to His creature, man, and to secure man in conditions of holy love before Him for ever, not merely in the blessing that a great benefactor might bestow on someone whom he regards as needy but in circumstances of the greatest conceivable nearness and in the liberty and affection which God has been pleased to devise for man; but in thus being made known, He having come into the light, He has in mind that we should be formed by the light in which He is thus revealed.<a name=324:4></a>

		from God (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21">Revelation  21</a>); it will be marked by great substantiality, immense substance.<a name=325:1></a> The book of Revelation is a book of figures, it is not intended to be taken literally, but we are told in that book that the length of the city and the breadth of it and the height of it are each twelve thousand stadia, and if the Spirit of God gives us measurements, while He does not expect us to be literal in our thoughts, or unduly mathematical, yet He does give us these measurements in order that we may pay attention to them and so be impressed with immensity of substance, and anyone who takes the trouble to work out what the measurement of the city is according to these details given us will arrive at it that it is something over three thousand million cubic miles.<a name=325:2></a> I only mention that, not, as I say, to engage you with things in a literal way, but that the Spirit of God intends us to be impressed with immensity of substance formed in the saints as the result of the revelation of God in the way in which He has come out, so that there should be a vessel, as it comes down out of heaven from God, capable of exercising divine influence upon the whole universe.<a name=325:3></a> In all its influence, in all its movements, in all its actings, it will be an impression of God that is left.<a name=325:4></a> Now that is not to be a mere abstract idea before our minds for the formation of it is going on now and each of us is a necessary part of it.<a name=325:5></a> The formation has to go on in our own souls, and it is to come out in that which is substantially formed in every one of us, so that, as our eyes are opened to see what God is effecting by means of the light in which He has come out in revelation, we can see in the saints what is of God and rejoice to see it as it comes out in its various features and activities.<a name=325:6></a>

		Well now, in reading this passage in the first epistle to the Thessalonians, I wanted to point out, first of all, how Paul himself is formed by the knowledge of God, and then in the other passages how others are brought out as all of them setting forth certain features of this formative work which the blessed God is carrying on.<a name=326:6></a> Paul says in writing to the Thessalonians, "we have not at any time been among you with flattering discourse, even as ye know, nor with a pretext for covetousness, God is witness; nor seeking glory from men," <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#2:5">1 Thessalonians  2:5</a>, 6.<a name=326:7></a> He begins with that which is negative and moral.<a name=326:8></a> He is going to lead on to that which is positive, how he was formed in love, but he begins first of all with that which is negative and moral, and he says that they had not been among them at any time with flattering discourse.<a name=326:9></a> That is an important matter, for "God is light, and in him is no darkness at all," <a href="../bible/1John.htm#1:5">1 John  1:5</a>.<a name=326:10></a>

		The more we have to do with God, the more we have things exactly as they are, and desire to have them exactly as they are, and we do not resort to flattery.<a name=326:11></a> Flattery is a most dangerous thing, and a most unholy thing in the things of God.<a name=326:12></a> Elihu said, "I know not how to flatter; my maker would soon take me away," <a href="../bible/Job.htm#32:22">Job  32:22</a>.<a name=326:13></a> There is a danger

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, I do not want to dwell unduly on these three features, but only to point out that the apostle brings them in first as moral elements that are all around us in the world and may tend to mark any one of us, but from which he was delivered by the light that he had of the blessed God.<a name=327:13></a> But now he says further, "we might have been a charge as

		Paul had taken on the character of a nursing mother, a remarkable thing, that the same kind of feelings and watchful care that had come into expression in the Spirit of God were now finding their counterpart in Paul himself in the way he laboured among the Thessalonian saints, but then he was also affected by what he saw in Christ, and so he goes on to say, "Thus, yearning over you, we had found our delight in having imparted to you not only the glad tidings of God, but our own lives also, .<a name=329:6></a>.<a name=329:7></a>.<a name=329:8></a> " <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#1:8">1 Thessalonians  1:8</a>.<a name=329:9></a> That is, he had come under the impress of the love of Christ.<a name=329:10></a> "He has laid down his life for us" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:16">1 John  3:16</a>), as it says.<a name=329:11></a> "Hereby we have known love, because <i>he</i> has laid down his life for us; and <i>we</i> ought for the brethren to lay down our lives.<a name=329:12></a>" This was working out in the apostle.<a name=329:13></a> It was no longer a matter simply of what was stated in the scripture; it was not only a matter now even of what had come to light in Christ and the Spirit, but it was there formed substantially in Paul.<a name=329:14></a> The thing was taking form in a substantial way in Paul.<a name=329:15></a> He

	<div class="paragraph">
		I think we can see that in that which actuated the apostle in his movements at Thessalonica there is a kind of allusion to the fact that he was impressed with the way God has come out, the Spirit and the Son and the Father, each in turn having His own influence upon the apostle and affecting his outlook towards the saints.<a name=331:13></a> There was that which was in the apostle Paul, formed in him, that corresponded with God.<a name=331:14></a>

		Sometimes it may be Satan is allowed to bring in hindrances to our spirits when we are praying, and the great thing is not to give way, to continue in prayer until the hindrance is removed.<a name=337:5></a> The hindrance <i>will</i> be removed.<a name=337:6></a> Of course, if there is a moral reason for the hindrance, the only way to remove it is to judge it, but sometimes the enemy may bring in pressure upon the mind or obstruction upon the spirit in order to hinder prayer, and the great thing is not to surrender to him but to go on praying, and we will find that power comes in and we get released.<a name=337:7></a> It is a question of combating earnestly in prayer, and no doubt Epaphras, as having the whole will of God before him, being earnest as to it, would not only have the mind of God itself before him, but would also be marked by perception as to the different movements of the enemy, the different influences that were being brought to bear upon the saints, that would hinder them from entering into those things.<a name=337:8></a> And so he says, "Epaphras .<a name=337:9></a>.<a name=337:10></a>.<a name=337:11></a> the bondman of Christ Jesus, salutes you, always combating earnestly for you in prayers, to the end that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God," and then he goes on to say "that he labours much for you, and them in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis," verse 13.<a name=337:12></a> That is, he is a brother who was enlarged; he could take in two neighbouring assemblies as well.<a name=337:13></a> What a commendation!<a name=337:14></a> Upon Paul there came daily the burden of all the assemblies.<a name=337:15></a> Epaphras was perhaps not equal to that, but he was at any rate equal to the burden of three assemblies.<a name=337:16></a> Well now, that is a

		We cannot estimate the value of the impressions that have been left in the hearts of the saints in our considerations these two days, for they are many and varied and wealthy.<a name=342:1></a> They are impressions that belong to another world; they belong to what is eternal; they belong to the Father's world.<a name=342:2></a> We must have felt -- every loyal heart must feel -- the need to come practically into the exercises that make for the consolidation of these expressions in our hearts.<a name=342:3></a> In that connection the world in which we are stands so directly opposed and hostile to the divine realm, for it is Satan's great system by which he holds men, and, alas, holds many believers; and what I would like to speak about this evening is practical deliverance from it, for we must have noticed, as the Scriptures have come before us, that all we have been speaking about in connection with this economy of love lies entirely outside the world as such, and that our access into it, and the opening up of the Father's realm, is on the basis of this world being overcome; the Lord Jesus saying, "Be of good comfort; I have overcome the world.<a name=342:4></a>" This was His last word before, in heart and mind and affection, He turned to the Father.<a name=342:5></a> Indeed, there are many passages that speak of this holy movement out of the world to the Father, and I am sure that our hearts have been allured and attracted -- perhaps as never before -- by the glory of what is unseen and yet so blessedly real, in the knowledge of divine Persons.<a name=342:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And yet this matter of our being in the world remains, as the Lord Jesus said in speaking to the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Father: "I am no longer in the world, and these are in the world, and I come to thee.<a name=343:1></a>" We can but feel how the saints in the world are the subject of the most tender affection, and not only of tender affection but of infinite power to keep them there, just as long as it is desired, for the Lord Jesus is the One who is in entire control.<a name=343:2></a> As we were being so happily reminded, everything goes through according to the divine plan, and yet He says, "I do not demand that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them out of evil.<a name=343:3></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are many allusions to the way we are to be kept.<a name=343:4></a> We think of the Father keeping.<a name=343:5></a> What that means!<a name=343:6></a> Consider the Father -- the greatness of that Person in His tender consideration -- and yet in His sovereign power keeping the saints, <i>keeping</i> them.<a name=343:7></a> Indeed it is a title of God, "unto him that is able to keep," and we would derive comfort and peace and holy joy from the knowledge that the Father is keeping us here.<a name=343:8></a> Then we think too of the Lord Jesus, the apostle in opening up the word to the Galatians saying, "our Lord Jesus Christ, who gave himself for our sins, so that he should deliver us out of the present evil world.<a name=343:9></a>" Then we are reminded of the word as to the Holy Spirit: "Greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world.<a name=343:10></a>" So that, beloved brethren, there is every occasion for peace and joy, and indeed thanksgiving.<a name=343:11></a> It should all enhance the worship of divine Persons to us, as we think of Their ability to keep the saints in the world without loss or harm.<a name=343:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then, in the wisdom of God, there is the practical working out of this matter, that not only are we said to be kept and delivered, and not only have we this wonderful indwelling of the Holy Ghost, but we are to overcome the world and thereby acquire a constitution.<a name=343:13></a> We are left here not only for testimony
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=344>[Page 344]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		but with a view to our acquiring a constitution, and so our very being in the world is to serve this great end, the Lord Jesus saying, "I am no longer in the world, and these are in the world.<a name=344:1></a>" What a wonderful consideration that in that sense the saints are to continue what was here seen in Jesus in that blessed way.<a name=344:2></a> One would trust that the consideration of such a momentous matter should profoundly affect our hearts.<a name=344:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And now as to our being here in the world, this world in which we are, though it be the very scene of divine operations, remains in its dreadful hostility to all that is of God.<a name=344:4></a> Indeed it is the great obstructer, "the prince of this world," the great system which in its entirety and totality stands over against all that divine Persons have brought in.<a name=344:5></a> I am impressed, beloved brethren, by the fact that the whole world is spoken of in its entirety as being opposed and standing over against what is of the Father.<a name=344:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So the word in John's epistle comes with peculiar appeal, surely, to all our hearts.<a name=344:7></a> "I have written to you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abides in you .<a name=344:8></a>.<a name=344:9></a>.<a name=344:10></a> .<a name=344:11></a> Love not the world, nor the things in the world.<a name=344:12></a>" Let us understand, beloved brethren, that there is no point of conciliation between the world and the divine system.<a name=344:13></a> What belongs to the Father is in complete separation from all that there is in the world.<a name=344:14></a> And so the word of the apostle John.<a name=344:15></a> What a man he was in the consciousness of divine affections!<a name=344:16></a> He knew the Persons of whom he spoke.<a name=344:17></a> He knew the Father, and he knew the Son of God, and he knew the Comforter.<a name=344:18></a> What holy conscious knowledge was there in the one who now makes this appeal and gives this word of exhortation to the young men; and one has a concern, dear brethren, that the generation that is growing up -- and God deals in generations -- should have constitution and experience and maturity, and John with

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Spirit of God would help us to get a right impression of the world.<a name=345:3></a> I am not speaking now, for a moment, as to our experience, but rather viewing it abstractly as a system in which all the lusts of the flesh find release and indulgence.<a name=345:4></a> He would, so to speak, describe it in spiritual terms, that we might be free from it, and concerned to be free from it, for, as he tells us, there is no reason for not being free from it, for "greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world.<a name=345:5></a>" Then, as if to conclude the whole matter for us, he would say, "We know .<a name=345:6></a>.<a name=345:7></a>.<a name=345:8></a> the whole world lies in the wicked one.<a name=345:9></a>" If we have any doubts, if we have had any points of compromise, let us be challenged, dear brethren, by the words of the Spirit of God from the beloved apostle, that "the whole world lies in the wicked one," and outside of it, we may say, totally and entirely outside of it, subsists this system of living affections -- the Father, and the Son, and the Comforter, and the saints.<a name=345:10></a> All these blessed and eternal relationships shall never deteriorate, shall never cease; they are all entirely outside of this world; this world standing, as it were, as the great obstructer to the divine realm, and hence the Lord Jesus saying, "I have overcome the world.<a name=345:11></a>"

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have read from this most remarkable Psalm, which is a review by a spiritual person, by a man of God -- a review of the history of things beginning, we might say, with the question of being delivered from this present evil world.<a name=346:3></a> So right at the beginning of this Psalm we have the question of generations to come being fully acquainted with the truth, and it would imply that we are to learn the truth in a living way; that not only should we have ministry, and what is written, but that we should learn the truth as it is in persons.<a name=346:4></a> Paul could speak of Timothy reminding the saints of his ways as they are in Christ.<a name=346:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the Psalm opens up with the provision made for the continuance of the truth in the generations that are to come.<a name=346:6></a> It must be a concern that the generations to come should have the truth as borne witness to in persons and as learned livingly; so that, right at the outset, the blessed God was careful to have the truth in Israel in such a way that it could be taken account of.<a name=346:7></a> We were reminded on the past night of what was substantial, and it would seem that right at the outset God ordained that the elders in Israel should come into the matter of this great truth of deliverance.<a name=346:8></a> In <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#3">Exodus  3</a>, Moses is told to take with him the elders of Israel to Pharaoh, as though He would bring into relief the question and importance of the truth being set out in experienced persons amongst us, that there should be scope and opportunity for all to learn directly from persons, that they might tell it to their children, and so on, to the generations to come.<a name=346:9></a> Think of God having generations who have learned the truth, beloved brethren, and in whom, so to speak, there are no moral defects!<a name=346:10></a>

		I feel the importance of the younger brethren learning the truth, not only learning about it, but as coming into it in a very vital kind of way, and hence the obligation on the elders that it should be there set out.<a name=347:1></a> The reference to the elders is not to give them precedence exactly but rather to put upon them the obligation of the diffusion of the truth in Israel.<a name=347:2></a> We read in this first reference to them that they were to be with Moses at his interviews with Pharaoh, so that they should understand what was in hand as to the great thoughts of God in the deliverance of His people.<a name=347:3></a> Then too, as speaking of the passover, special word was given to the elders that what was said in the initial commandment to Israel might be augmented and amplified, so that it should have weight and so that it should be there by example in what was done.<a name=347:4></a> The word as to seizing the lamb, and the blood in the basins implying what could be handled, and the use of hyssop, would all indicate what is to be seen and taken account of by way of example in the elders.<a name=347:5></a> Later, in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#17">Exodus  17</a>, the word speaks of the elders being with Moses at the smiting of the rock.<a name=347:6></a> I am sure, beloved brethren, the Spirit of God has in mind that these great truths should be held in gravity and moral power amongst us, so that the smiting of the rock was not to be a mere doctrine.<a name=347:7></a> It was not to be a matter simply understood as making way for the gift of the Spirit, but the very importance of it, the solemnity of it, all that it would mean in the sufferings of Christ, was to be present with weight, finding residence, we might say, in the elders of Israel, all with a view to what was formative in the generation that was springing up.<a name=347:8></a>

		The impressions, dear brethren, we shall take away from these gatherings will be many and varied but they will have one thing in common, for we have all been freshly impressed, not only with the greatness of what God has planned for His pleasure and the love that gave rise to it, but also with the preciousness of the One in whom these things have reached us.<a name=353:2></a> His personal place in the divine plan, and the closest possible link we are to have with Him, our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God.<a name=353:3></a> I suppose as reviewing the meetings it would be legitimate to recall the chord that was struck in our hearts, "Behold the man!<a name=353:4></a>" "Behold your king!<a name=353:5></a>" and I have in mind, dear brethren, to speak of Jesus personally, as the One who, according to divine design, is to fill a most remarkable place in the divine realm, not only in relation to the kingdom, but in relation to eternity.<a name=353:6></a> Not only does He fill that place because He is the only One who could fill it, but because it is part of the divine plan that God has designed to bring everything under the domination of one Man, for I apprehend that the kingdom is the settlement of everything in time to make way for the family conditions which will exist in eternity.<a name=353:7></a> With this in view, dear brethren, it is the greatest possible advantage to us to be made aware of what God has before Him to do.<a name=353:8></a> He knows the end from the beginning.<a name=353:9></a> We often have to wait for the unfolding of things, and it is well that we should learn how to wait, and there is that, of course, which is given sovereignly, for instance, to Paul -- his knowledge of the mystery, it was not

		What is in mind now is that Jacob does not mince matters.<a name=357:8></a> He passes over his first three sons with a remarkable rapidity, for if my understanding of the chapter is correct, the two main types of Christ in the chapter are Judah and Joseph, with Benjamin, of course, linked with Judah, but Judah and Joseph.<a name=357:9></a> Judah stands for the establishment of the kingdom and Joseph stands for the establishment of what belongs to the family circle that is going into eternity.<a name=357:10></a> So you get the "bounds of the everlasting hills.<a name=357:11></a>" It is figurative language, and it goes beyond the bounds of the time scene.<a name=357:12></a> In this chapter we can see what it meant for Jacob to have witnessed what had occurred in his first three sons.<a name=357:13></a> He speaks of Reuben as to what he was.<a name=357:14></a> "Thou art my firstborn, My might, and the first-fruits of my vigour: Excellency of dignity, and excellency of strength.<a name=357:15></a>" But it is of no value in the divine realm because it is all of the flesh and there is written over these first three sons, "The flesh profits nothing.<a name=357:16></a>" Paul learned it, "That in me, that is, in my flesh, good does not dwell," <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7:18">Romans  7:18</a>.<a name=357:17></a> We repeat these things, dear brethren, but what hopes we have at times and how we need to be disciplined out of them, for God has taken us up not in regard to what we are in the flesh, but what
