		HOW WE ARE HELPED AND HINDERED IN A DAY OF DIFFICULTY
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In our own circumstances, and in the church, there is a 'needs be' for straits or the trying of our faith.<a name=1:1></a> To this end "tribulation worketh patience", and we are to count it all joy when we fall into divers trials, because the trying of our faith worketh patience, or endurance; and in the church there must be heresies, that they which are approved may be made manifest.<a name=1:2></a> Straits then are to be expected and looked for, as in the circle of the year the winter is looked for.<a name=1:3></a> The ant not only provides for the winter, but also knows what are its resources or helps at such a time, and what its hindrances.<a name=1:4></a> Now this is just our wisdom, to ascertain what are our helps and hindrances in our winter or strait.<a name=1:5></a> It is said of the ant that it displays its wisdom by providing in summer for the winter.<a name=1:6></a> This teaches us that it is the joy and confidence we have in the Lord in the bright day, or the summer, which we are to use and call up afresh to our hearts in the dark day, or the winter.<a name=1:7></a> In a word, we are to be supplied with the good things of summer in the depth of winter.<a name=1:8></a> The same Lord is to comfort and sustain our hearts in the dark day, as He has done in the bright day.<a name=1:9></a> The one help then is the Lord.<a name=1:10></a> I do not say that help may not be given by others, but if it is it must be because of their faith.<a name=1:11></a> Faith in God is the one simple help.<a name=1:12></a> Now though this is not only known, but also acted on in a measure, yet we are constantly exposed to hindrances from those who should have helped us by their faith.<a name=1:13></a>

		Let us trace how the two are presented in Scripture.<a name=1:14></a> Adam in the moment of his wife's apostasy is beguiled by her; she who should have helped him is his hindrance, and simply because she has fallen herself, she drags him into the same depths.<a name=1:15></a> But he rises in faith out of it when he calls her Eve, "the mother of all living".<a name=1:16></a> He is alone

		in his faith; and this is the great principle taught in Scripture, that in faith one must act alone, and the hindrances come from persons whose coalescence or cooperation we seek, either indirectly or directly.<a name=2:1></a> Here Abraham was hampered and hindered.<a name=2:2></a> Lot was not a help, but a hindrance, from which he only extricated himself by acting in simple faith, surrendering his natural rights in confidence in God.<a name=2:3></a> At another time Sarah hindered him in the path and blessing of faith (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#16">Genesis  16</a>), but God restored him to it in the circumcision (chapter 17).<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Moses began in faith, and "refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter; choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season"; yet his confidence in God failed when he said, "I am not eloquent".<a name=2:5></a> In too much confidence in his own power he had attempted by his own hand to deliver his people.<a name=2:6></a> But now, though self-distrusting, he did not reckon fully on God as able to act independently and in spite of his slowness of speech.<a name=2:7></a> His brother Aaron was given to help him; but more than once he was his greatest hindrance in the hour of trial.<a name=2:8></a> In his absence he made the golden calf, and made the people naked to their shame.<a name=2:9></a> So much for the one whom Moses had accepted to help him in lieu of the Lord, or in lack of faith; and this very brother afterwards joined with his sister Miriam in disparaging Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#12">Numbers  12</a>).<a name=2:10></a> He was also hindered by Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.<a name=2:11></a> However, when he took the ground of simple faith alone, and from thence invited and called to those "on the Lord's side", the children of the house of Levi gathered themselves unto him.<a name=2:12></a> Faith is the one real help, and as we walk distinctly in it we encourage and promote the faith of any who have it.<a name=2:13></a> It is of all importance to see that this help is from the Lord only, and though co-operation and countenance from our fellows are not to be refused or disregarded, yet any help we receive through them must

		come to them from the Lord; for if not, their support, however well intended, will be a hindrance.<a name=3:1></a> How often was Joab a hindrance to David; and eventually he died by the sword -- the necessary penalty of those who assume to do God's work after their own devices.<a name=3:2></a> It is refreshing to see how David succeeded when he walked alone in faith, whether in the matter of Goliath, Ziklag, or Mount Moriah.<a name=3:3></a> Surely he could in the depth of his heart say, "blessed is the man that trusteth in thee".<a name=3:4></a> When the man of faith has recourse to man's ways, and accepts the help even of the best disposed, there is sure to be a Perez-Uzzah, as David found to his sorrow when he submitted to the influences around him, and sanctioned that the ark of the Lord should be carried on a cart.<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus in times of difficulty there is less danger of being hindered, when there is no apparent help at all, than when one or more offer their assistance.<a name=3:6></a> We do well to watch and examine every proffer of help in every strait.<a name=3:7></a> Anything or any one who turns us from faith, however promising or enterprising, is really hindering.<a name=3:8></a> We get full and clear instruction as to this in the walk of our blessed Lord.<a name=3:9></a> When He had come down from the mount and was journeying to Jerusalem to die, even John, by his natural jealousy on His behalf, hinders Him.<a name=3:10></a> "We saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#9:49">Luke  9:49</a>.<a name=3:11></a> The great significance and warning in this incident is that the best natural feeling leads one astray in divine things.<a name=3:12></a> Hence in verse 54 we have John and James praying the Lord to command fire to come down from heaven to destroy those who did not receive Him; which drew forth from the Lord the well-merited and sharp rebuke, "Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of".<a name=3:13></a> It is here that all the error arises, and the consequent hindrance to the man of faith.<a name=3:14></a> The most loving or the most devoted may suggest or adopt some natural course which is not of God, and there is necessarily a check and breach.<a name=3:15></a> If there were not, it would prove that God could sanction what He

		disallows, namely, sowing your field with divers seeds, or plowing with an ox and an ass.<a name=4:1></a> If these helps were proffered by any one whose friendship were in any way questionable, there would not be so much danger from them, because one would be more wary in accepting them; but when they come from those who are not only most deeply attached, but truly devoted to their Lord, then there is a greater probability of being drawn away by them.<a name=4:2></a> No one, thank God, could turn our Lord from the path of simple faith.<a name=4:3></a> The suggestion or counsel of the most loving disciple was as unheeded and as sharply rebuked by Him as the worst and most inveterate effort of an enemy.<a name=4:4></a> Thus when Peter, in real consideration for Him, said, with reference to His death, "Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee", the Lord indignantly replied, "Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men".<a name=4:5></a> It is here that the man of faith is so often hindered; natural affection suggests some easy path instead of the path of testimony and suffering; and if one has not his heart fixed on the Lord, he will be hindered by the very one who may at the same moment have the most light and the most of nature, as it was with Peter, for his counsel was most inopportune and inadequate in that trying moment.<a name=4:6></a> He errs in the same way when he cuts off the ear of the high priest's servant.<a name=4:7></a> Daring zeal or extreme acts in the attempt to accomplish a desired end are often more hindering than slackness or cowardice.<a name=4:8></a> How entirely Peter misunderstood the mind and path of the Lord at the time; and instead of being in fellowship with Him in it, he in his eager haste had done a wrong which nothing but the immediate mercy of the Lord could rectify or remove.<a name=4:9></a>

		In Paul's history we are taught how he was helped in times of difficulty, and how he was hindered.<a name=4:10></a> Peter, having shown how fully he agreed with him by eating with the gentiles, withdrew when certain came from James, fearing them of the circumcision.<a name=4:11></a> The one whose

		approbation and countenance had for a moment most helped him was the one who by his unfaithfulness or fear most hindered him; so much so that his chief friend and companion Barnabas was carried away by their dissimulation.<a name=5:1></a> When Paul refused to take with them John, whose surname was Mark, Barnabas betrayed the damage he had sustained, and acted unfaithfully; he took Mark and sailed unto Cyprus.<a name=5:2></a> When one assents to another's departure from principle, he is sure to depart from it himself when the pressure comes upon him.<a name=5:3></a> Barnabas yields to Peter, and he at length is foremost and violent in opposing the faithfulness of the apostle Paul.<a name=5:4></a> In like manner at Jerusalem James hindered Paul by his well-intentioned prudence, involving him in troubles from which he escaped through human means and contrivances more than by direct interposition.<a name=5:5></a> Paul learned in the ship (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#27">Acts  27</a>), that his help came from the Lord; that when everything on which man could count would be wrecked, God was mighty to save.<a name=5:6></a> His word was, "God hath given thee all them that sail with thee".<a name=5:7></a> We find afterwards that when all in Asia had turned away from him, when those he might have reckoned on had slid away, yea, when all men forsook him, he surmounted each and all of these hindrances.<a name=5:8></a> He is not discouraged, his sure resource is in God.<a name=5:9></a> At the most trying moment he can testify, "the Lord stood with me.<a name=5:10></a>.<a name=5:11></a>.<a name=5:12></a> and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion"; an example and a witness to us that, however hindered and unsupported by man, the solitary saint dependent on the Lord will be supported by Him.<a name=5:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the passage in Jeremiah the words at the head of this paper were applied, not to some particular works, or to mere conduct, but to the course adopted by each.<a name=6:2></a> Those who were good adopted and adhered to the path approved of by God, and those who did not bow to His ways were evil, very evil.<a name=6:3></a> It is the <i>principle</i> of which I speak here, and it is important to seize it -- that I am "good" when I follow and adhere to that which God marks out for me, however small and humiliating it may be in the eyes of man; and that it is "evil" when, contrary to God's counsel, I cleave to things now prohibited because of man's failure, refused and forbidden.<a name=6:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the day of Israel's captivity those who recognised the ruin of Israel accepted the captivity, and they were good, very good.<a name=6:5></a> "Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel; Like these good figs, so will I acknowledge them that are carried away captive of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for their good.<a name=6:6></a> For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.<a name=6:7></a> And I will give them a heart to know me, that I am the Lord: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they shall return unto me with their whole heart", <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#24:5">Jeremiah  24:5</a> - 7.<a name=6:8></a> While, on the contrary, those who would not bow, but would remain in the land as if nothing had happened to disqualify them, were evil, very evil.<a name=6:9></a>

		Very amiable, highly moral men might have been among the latter, but whatever they were in their immediate behaviour, they were, as to testimony to God, evil, very evil; while those who had accepted the place of littleness in man's eye, and who were wholly cast on God, were, however naturally unattractive, good, very good.<a name=6:10></a> However one may be influenced by another to a certain point, no one can, in simple faith, enter on or

	<div class="paragraph">
		Having seen that it is the course one pursues which really determines whether one is good or evil, let us next examine how each respectively increases, so that the good becomes very good and the evil very evil.<a name=7:4></a> Continuance under any governing power must necessarily increase its rule and influence over us.<a name=7:5></a> The more we are under it, the more we shall be under it.<a name=7:6></a> Thus habits are called 'second nature'.<a name=7:7></a> Cain may have intended well when he began, but he was wrong in his course from the first; hence he was evil, and in the end proved to be very evil.<a name=7:8></a> Thus Lot, possibly exemplary in all the relations of life, took a wrong course when he chose the well-watered plains; he, by degrees, became more and more identified with this wrong course; he dwelt in Sodom, and sat in the gate of it.<a name=7:9></a> Even though his righteous soul was vexed from day to day with their unlawful deeds, he was more under the control of a wrong influence, and hence the evil was very evil.<a name=7:10></a>

		When one has been carried away by an evil influence, he can never estimate the extent of his departure until, by the good hand of the Lord, he seeks to return to the ground which he has abandoned.<a name=7:11></a> So it was with Lot; until he was aroused by God's mercy he had no idea of the depth of the wickedness there, or its power to render his sons-in-law insensible to his exhortation, though angels authorised and corroborated it.<a name=7:12></a> It is one of the terrible characteristics of an evil influence, that one never knows the depth he has sunk to until he tries to rise out of it.<a name=7:13></a> It is a delusion all the way down, and therefore the repentance or recovery is also gradual, and for this

		In like manner with the spies; ten of them did not fail in conduct, so called, but having lost faith in God, and having been terrified by the giants in Canaan, and the cities walled up to heaven, they not only took a wrong course for themselves, but they discouraged the people -- the evil became very evil.<a name=8:8></a> They might have pleaded their honesty, and their care for the people too, but they lost sight of the Lord, and started aside like a deceitful bow, and thus promoted a universal defection; it was the "day of provocation".<a name=8:9></a> Caleb and Joshua, on the other hand, were the "good", who became more distinctly good every day, and were increasingly bright in their testimony to that great truth, "Blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is.<a name=8:10></a> For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreadeth out her roots by the river, and shall not see when heat cometh, but her leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit", <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#17:7">Jeremiah  17:7</a>, 8.<a name=8:11></a>

		Jonah, in another day, ran counter to the path prescribed for him by the Lord as a servant.<a name=9:12></a> However personally amiable he might be, yet in following his own will in contravention of the Lord's directions he was evil, and every step he took in that course was increasingly evil.<a name=9:13></a> It is not so much the particular act which I do which determines its character, as whether it is of God or of man.<a name=9:14></a> If the former, it is good; if the latter, it is evil.<a name=9:15></a> An act might be very evil with regard to God, which as far as man sees, did not inflict any injury on man.<a name=9:16></a> When man is injured, everyone can see the evil, and reprobate it; but this is an evil in the sight of God, and very grievous too, when man thinks of himself only, and slights the will and mind of God.<a name=9:17></a> Peter, in following the Lord to the high priest's house, was doing his own will; it was evil, and soon became very evil.<a name=9:18></a> The apostle Paul, though most exemplary in life and morals,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When Paul contended for the truth of the gospel, the good was very good, and if Peter had not repented, the evil would have been very evil.<a name=10:7></a> As it was, Barnabas was carried away by their dissimulation.<a name=10:8></a> The way to check the evil is by strictly and unswervingly insisting on the right course; and as this is insisted on, the good becomes apparent, and established, and then it is very good.<a name=10:9></a> But if the wrong course be not at once renounced and repented of, it will increase, according to its evil, to more ungodliness.<a name=10:10></a> For as the good is brought out into distinctness, there will be less excuse for the wrong one, and the folly shall be "made manifest unto all", though the leaders may not repent but wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.<a name=10:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In conclusion, may we be warned and encouraged to refuse any course which is not of God; may we have such simple faith in Him that we can, like the faithful in Israel in that day, accept the place of confessed weakness, without place or name on the earth, confident in heart that the Lord is sufficient for us, and that though there be no bread in the ship, nothing to minister to or prop up the man or his resources, the Lord is adequate for every exigency.<a name=10:12></a> To advocate and adhere to the use

		If the motive be self-consideration, and the object be self-exaltation, then the act, whatever it is, is a slight to the Spirit of God, and it is tempting the Spirit of the Lord.<a name=19:3></a> As the Holy Spirit is present on the earth to testify of Christ, every time I attempt to obtain distinction for myself -- whether with the best plausible reasons, openly, like the priests, offering strange fire, that is, fire of their own, or secretly, like Achan, to acquire something for myself, I am tempting the Spirit of the Lord.<a name=19:4></a> I am always tempting Him when I am acting so as to question the fact of His presence, because it is evident that if I were simply sure that He was present, I neither could nor would seek myself.<a name=19:5></a> I should be at once rebuked and controlled.<a name=19:6></a> The fact that, at the very moment of the greatest demonstration of the Holy Spirit's presence on earth, any two could be found to seek their own importance in God's assembly, is unquestionable evidence that the great aim of Satan is to ignore the presence of the Holy Spirit, and to lead souls to act as if He were not here.<a name=19:7></a> Therefore Peter says, "Why has Satan filled thy heart that thou shouldest lie to the Holy Spirit"?<a name=19:8></a> As afterwards, to Sapphira, "Why is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord?<a name=19:9></a>" Anything which is done by the flesh, or dictated by man's mind, it may be unintentionally, denies the presence of the Holy Spirit.<a name=19:10></a> The sons of Aaron might have alleged that their only object was to increase the amount of fire; but the attempt to add to God's fire and supply any, implied that God's was not enough.<a name=19:11></a> Surely that was tempting the Spirit of the Lord, because it assumed that He would not take notice of it, though they were detracting from God to honour themselves.<a name=19:12></a> Achan's act was secret, and he was led to expect it would never be discovered, though he tempted the Lord in appropriating to his own advantage what was devoted to Him.<a name=19:13></a> Would the Lord

		The more we study and are acquainted with all the ways of God with man, the more we see that the existence of evil gave occasion for the declaration of good.<a name=22:7></a> A man of full age, or matured, is one who has his senses exercised to discern good and evil; he knows that whenever there is an evil there must be a good to supersede it, and he can always determine an evil by, and according to, his knowledge of the good.<a name=22:8></a> The existence of evil is trying to each one according as he is led of God, for God is good and doeth good, but though he will be tried by it, he is not to be overcome by it, but to overcome evil with good, for this is God's way.<a name=22:9></a> Nothing tries the God-fearing soul more than that one professing the same faith as himself, and apparently enlightened by the same truth, should perversely insist on and maintain his own mind contrary to the mind of the Lord; yet this very great trial -- which is a heresy, we read -- is necessary, that the approved may be made manifest.<a name=22:10></a> The fact that heresies are necessary for this end, while on the one hand it supplies a balm to the godly one tried by the heresy, is on the other hand of great warning; for when the testing comes, it is only those equal to the test who shall be manifested.<a name=22:11></a> The approved must not remain unseen.<a name=22:12></a> It is the gracious purpose of God that the good must come abroad; He that sees in secret rewards openly.<a name=22:13></a> The disciples were

		Now this true daily exercise, common to and incumbent on every saint, is <i>par excellence</i> to be observed by the minister.<a name=27:4></a> If I minister to that which should be repressed and supplanted, I am defeating the very object of ministry; for instead of really helping souls, I am, by the wisdom of men, in some form ministering to the flesh.<a name=27:5></a> In every case, whether in myself, or in ministering to others, the one great thing is that the Spirit should be heard.<a name=27:6></a> Hence, if I were speaking to the unconverted, the one great thing I should seek would be that he should hear the voice of the Lord.<a name=27:7></a> I do not seek so much to convince him of anything as to bring his conscience under the eye of God.<a name=27:8></a> It is God I seek to present.<a name=27:9></a> It is His coming near in grace, detecting man's distance in the words, "Where art thou?<a name=27:10></a>" that I insist on as led by the Spirit of God.<a name=27:11></a> It is how God would speak, and not how man might be convinced.<a name=27:12></a> It is evident that it must be in intelligible language, for the conscience cannot be addressed if the words used are not comprehended.<a name=27:13></a> But as I carefully avoid, in my own private walk and course, the counsel or dictation of my natural mind, so do I refuse and avoid every mere natural means, in language or manner, which would recognise and minister to the natural mind which is enmity to God.<a name=27:14></a> The one aim is to bring God's voice close to man's conscience.<a name=27:15></a> It is not man's voice, nor man's arguments, for then it is all man; but it is to be the messenger of God, and that man's conscience may own it.<a name=27:16></a> As Manoah said, "we have seen God".<a name=27:17></a>

		Let us come to detail, and examine how and when we are drawn away from what is simply spiritual to human efforts or the wisdom of men.<a name=30:2></a> Often in gospel preaching, when the danger of souls is vividly pressed on one's heart, simultaneously with the perfect grace and mercy in God to avert it, one is rightly almost overwhelmed, and words would fail to express the yearnings of the heart.<a name=30:3></a> This might be quite of the Spirit, and when truly so, there would be a deeper sense of how ineffectually anything the wisdom of men would suggest would meet the demand.<a name=30:4></a> And then this deep yearning of the heart would be expressed, not coldly and languidly surely, but in solemn words of divine teaching, in such a sense of the gravity of the subject that there would be increase of fear lest anything not of God might intrude.<a name=30:5></a> Every one who has ever known the vigour of fresh light breaking in on the soul must know the desire for an ardent utterance.<a name=30:6></a> Often this is impossible to convey, but when possible, it affords an opportunity for vehement utterance with an excited manner.<a name=30:7></a> But then the power is lost in the display which would have been repressed if the Lord's presence were more before one, and thus depth of feeling would have been produced.<a name=30:8></a> For the deeper the feeling, the less possible is it to convey it, and the less necessary is it for God's glory that it should be conveyed through human means.<a name=30:9></a> So that when Paul came down from the third heaven, though his heart was stored with the deepest things, yet in a natural way he was less fitted to communicate them than before he was acquainted with them.<a name=30:10></a> The vessel is the Lord's, and He made it.<a name=30:11></a> Our care is that He uses us, and that our own feelings, or the wisdom of men, do not sway us in our service; for whenever the flesh is allowed in ministry, it ministers to flesh, and the end of ministry is defeated by itself.<a name=30:12></a>

		In conclusion, surely every faithful servant will heartily admit that his one and only duty is to promote the spiritual welfare of souls, and that Christ only, and nothing else, can effect this.<a name=31:10></a> If we all truly and before God adhere to this, there will be more spiritual ministry, and therefore more practical unworldliness; whereas whenever we give a place to the flesh before God, it will insist on and enlarge its place before man.<a name=31:11></a>

		There is no more dangerous snare than the adoption of a promise or a precept as one's object; for in proportion as it is the magnifying of a gift or a responsibility into a platform for personal distinction, so I must lose sight of the Lord in my pursuit; and when I do, every attainment or acquisition, however right and good in word, must be human, and effected by carnal means.<a name=50:7></a> Thus the farther I advance, the less I commend my efforts to the godly or the spiritual.<a name=50:8></a> Here the Evangelical Alliance failed.<a name=50:9></a> Many an earnest one was drawn into it, but as the heart grew nearer the Lord, it discovered that there was no real bond, no divine oneness mutually controlling them.<a name=50:10></a>

		Again, and here the difficulty increases, there are many who professedly hold church truth, so-called, who, while they advocate the oneness of all saints, do not command the co-operation of those who have Christ's desires simply before them, because they are not in careful separation from doctrinal taints, or the partisans of the authors of them.<a name=52:6></a> Though often well taught and much enlightened, they do not seem to seize the new ground, and holiness, by which only they can reach or in any degree secure, "that they may be all one".<a name=52:7></a>

		Finally, we may rest assured that the nearer we approach to the spiritual condition where oneness can be assured, the more will the more spiritual be drawn together in company, and the more will the Lord honour them with His gifts, so that they may be able to promote His desire, on the principle that "unto every one that hath shall be given".<a name=53:5></a> May the Lord stir our hearts to answer to His desires!<a name=53:6></a>

		The greatest object to the mind is its centre.<a name=59:1></a> That is the point from which every action springs, and to which all actions turn.<a name=59:2></a> If self be my greatest object, everything I do refers and relates to it, whether it be in physics or in ethics.<a name=59:3></a> This is evident enough in the unconverted man, even when he is religious, that is, answering to a natural conscience, as in the case of Cain.<a name=59:4></a> His centre was himself, and hence, when he would be accepted by God, he sought it in a way commendatory to himself in bringing the fruits, not only of his own labour, but of the earth which had been cursed by God on man's account.<a name=59:5></a> If I myself am my greatest object, everything I do and every judgment I form must be with reference to myself.<a name=59:6></a> I am the central point in connection with everything.<a name=59:7></a> Here the natural man necessarily must be, he cannot have any object greater than himself.<a name=59:8></a> However affectionate he may be in the relations of life, or however attached to any object, he makes himself the centre and judges and acts with reference to himself in all his likings and services.<a name=59:9></a>

		Now when a soul is converted, there is at least some sense of One immensely superior to oneself; and according as this true fear of God, which is the beginning of wisdom, obtains and rules in the soul, there is an entirely new centre, and things are looked at and done in relation to it.<a name=59:10></a> Hence we shall find in Scripture that as the relation to God is apprehended, and according to the measure of faith in that relation, so there is a new centre, and everything is necessarily characterised by it.<a name=59:11></a> Abel's faith leads him to see what is due to God; and his life and ways give evidence of the new centre he has found.<a name=59:12></a> He finds and enjoys a new relation with God: he is accepted, and he suffers at the hand of Cain for his new position.<a name=59:13></a> Accepted of God, he learns that he is rejected of man.<a name=59:14></a> His new centre is his only cheer and support in

		Enoch's centre was very marked, and he walked with God three hundred years; before his translation, he had this testimony, that he pleased God.<a name=60:6></a> He was translated that he should not see death.<a name=60:7></a> He had but the one object, to which he referred everything, and by which he was governed in everything.<a name=60:8></a> No wonder that "he was not; for God took him".<a name=60:9></a> He was in his walk the sample of the Man who was entirely to retrieve the distance and alienation into which man had fallen.<a name=60:10></a> I need not multiply examples; once we discover a principle in Scripture we shall easily and continually find examples of it.<a name=60:11></a> Thus Abram, Moses, Joshua, and the prophets, all corroborate this truth, that according to their faith and apprehension of God, so, as they were faithful, they were characterised by it in everything.<a name=60:12></a>

		It is interesting to note that to almost each of the Old Testament witnesses the Lord was revealed in a different and special way, and this was the centre or pivot on which that witness's life afterwards revolved.<a name=60:13></a> The Lord appeared to Moses in the burning bush; the Man with the drawn sword in His hand appeared to Joshua, the seraphim with the live coal to Isaiah.<a name=60:14></a> These revelations of God in His grace gave a colour in everything to the lives of those favoured.<a name=60:15></a> They were bright and useful

		Let us now carry all we have gathered as to this great principle to New Testament times, and let us endeavour to ascertain the cause for the differences in testimony by true and faithful men with regard to christianity.<a name=61:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is no ground or permission now, as there was in Old Testament times, for different revelations of God.<a name=61:3></a> The saints then were individually blest, even though on Israel there was national blessing.<a name=61:4></a> Now every believer belongs to the one and selfsame structure, the church of God.<a name=61:5></a> There is but one Head, one chief corner stone; and though there be a different apprehension of Him by each, and consequent effect, yet it is ignorance or want of faith which limits Christ to any position less than His real one.<a name=61:6></a> And if this be the case, even though the heart be true to Him, the testimony is inaccurate.<a name=61:7></a> Christianity is not really apprehended if Christ be not seen and accepted by faith in His true place.<a name=61:8></a> I do not say souls are not true and sincere, but if they have an incorrect centre, every circle and effort to be practical here must be inaccurate.<a name=61:9></a> Must we not make allowances for growth?<a name=61:10></a> Certainly, but growth is properly a fuller knowledge of Christ.<a name=61:11></a> Of this there are endless measures; I speak now of the simple fact of one's faith and apprehension of Christ's own place.<a name=61:12></a> I am not slighting or denying the fact that there are babes as well as young men, but I submit that the testimony of each must be according to his faith respecting Christ.<a name=61:13></a> If a babe did not see Him in His true place, then the babe's testimony as to the truth and walk of a babe would be inaccurate and incorrect, because the babe had not a true centre from which he started, and to which he turned, deriving all from it and referring all to it.<a name=61:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now as to testimony, one is hardly fit to be a witness until he knows what he is to testify of.<a name=61:15></a> The Lord says of the Holy Spirit, "He shall testify of me".<a name=61:16></a> Surely this was that He testified of Christ, not as He was on earth, but

		as He is at God's right hand; and hence I venture to say that no one can testify of Him now or be in the leading and guidance of the Holy Spirit who does not see Him by faith sitting down at the right hand of God.<a name=62:1></a> There can be no question as to the differences in the mode and subject of testimony, and these differences cannot arise merely from a feeble apprehension of a truth common to all.<a name=62:2></a> The testimonies are too varied and conflicting for this.<a name=62:3></a> As I have already said, it is as necessary for a babe to have a true centre to define and determine what is good and right in a babe, as it is for a father in Christ.<a name=62:4></a> If this centre is wrong he cannot be right in anything however sincere he might be.<a name=62:5></a>

		There is a very pious class, the most numerous, who really love the Saviour, and who are simple in this faith that He came into the world to die for sinners.<a name=62:7></a> They do not go much farther, and the prayer called the Lord's prayer very much describes the measure and extent of their spiritual state.<a name=62:8></a> They believe in the Saviour and a future salvation, but they expect that now God will order and provide blessings and advantages for them on the earth, and they regard every earthly advantage or position in this light.<a name=62:9></a> A Saviour on earth is their centre, and all their conceptions and expectations are in keeping with this, that a Saviour has come, and they look for a reign of blessing <i>here</i>.<a name=62:10></a> There are others in advance of them, who, as it were, see Christ offered up, the blood on the lintel and doorposts.<a name=62:11></a> They know they are quite safe from the judgment due to sinners; they are like the rescued in a lifeboat.<a name=62:12></a> They are like Abel, they know they are accepted through the offering of Jesus once for all.<a name=62:13></a> Yet they are not really out of Egypt, though in heart turning away from it and preparing to leave it.<a name=62:14></a> They are exclusively occupied with their escape, and they are

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next to these are those who see Christ risen, the triumphant One.<a name=63:5></a> They are set free from all fear of judgment, and they have peace with God; but they regard the resurrection of Christ only as to its effect upon themselves, as it is sometimes said, as the receipt in full for all their sins.<a name=63:6></a> They are so cleared by the work of Christ that they do look for the wilderness here, and for the Shepherd's care in carrying them through it, and are often like exiles in a strange country, entirely dissociated from the politics of the country, but very glad to enjoy the naturally good things in the country; and their acceptance and use of natural means in the Lord's service declare that they are not quite dissociated from the world.<a name=63:7></a>

		The last are those who date and refer everything to Christ at the right hand of God.<a name=63:8></a> They have no home but there, and the things of this world are no solace or enjoyment to them from whom the Bridegroom has been taken away.<a name=63:9></a> Their one and only business and joy here is to proclaim the goodness and greatness of the only-begotten Son, full of grace and truth.<a name=63:10></a> When my centre is at God's right hand I derive everything from my Lord there, and I refer everything to Him there.<a name=63:11></a>

		WHO IS IN THE TESTIMONY?
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There has always been a testimony.<a name=63:13></a> The expression "the testimony" is of frequent occurrence in the Old Testament, "the ark of the testimony", "the tabernacle of the testimony", and ".<a name=63:14></a>.<a name=63:15></a>.<a name=63:16></a> gave him the testimony".<a name=63:17></a> From the constant repetition of the word, it is very

		evident that the testimony was of the greatest importance.<a name=64:1></a> It is not necessary to add more to establish this great fact.<a name=64:2></a> Let us then first ascertain the testimony proper to the church, which now, even when general declension has set in, the faithful are called to maintain.<a name=64:3></a> There having always been a testimony, it varied according to the revelation God gave of Himself.<a name=64:4></a> The testimony could not go beyond the revelation, but necessarily must be in keeping with it.<a name=64:5></a> There was always, at every time, a feebleness or a declension in maintaining the testimony, or a surrender of it, when personal consideration weighed with the Lord's people; that is, if those who were called to witness were uncertain as to their own relation with God, or were indifferent to it, they forgot what was due to God, and considered only for themselves.<a name=64:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The testimony now is, "He shall testify of me".<a name=64:7></a> God sent His Son into this world "that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life"; and He is now at God's right hand, the Head of His body the church, which is down here as the real tabernacle of testimony.<a name=64:8></a> In the limits of this paper it is not possible to set forth fully the terms of the testimony.<a name=64:9></a> Suffice it to say that the testimony proper to the church is that all believers now have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, and are set up in the life and Spirit of Christ, a new man, the "church, which is his body".<a name=64:10></a> This testimony gave no place for man under the law, or in any way recognised the old man, save to insist and enforce that he should be in every position and relationship here as God had created him.<a name=64:11></a> The relative natural duties were to be fulfilled in divine power; he was to be subject to the powers that be.<a name=64:12></a> But the testimony declared that the Man at God's right hand was the Man of His purpose, and that now, through divine grace, we were of Him, and not only enjoying the efficacy of His work in our souls, but that we were through the Holy Spirit in conscious and abiding union with Him, so that His interests and concerns were ours.<a name=64:13></a> We testify of Him.<a name=64:14></a>

		The second prayer in Ephesians describes the occupation and delight of the heart which is truly in the calling of God.<a name=65:1></a> This testimony was of so high and superhuman a character that all they that were in Asia turned away from Paul as the teacher of it.<a name=65:2></a> The snare to which the Lord's people in every time have been exposed is to surrender the testimony to which they were called.<a name=65:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As the testimony is of God, it is plain that nothing but divine power can enable a man to maintain it.<a name=65:4></a> Hence the moment the heart is diverted from allegiance to Him, and faith wavers, there must be a declension or surrender of the testimony.<a name=65:5></a> From a sense of fear there is constantly great reluctance openly to admit that the testimony has been surrendered or dimmed; and many, because of this reluctance, degenerate into mere hypocrites, assuming and demanding acknowledgment for a status they desire to have, because it is true, but to which they have no claim on any other ground.<a name=65:6></a> It was so with the scribes and Pharisees in the Lord's day.<a name=65:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		No one is in the testimony who, though converted, is not at peace with God, though I trust there are those in this state who desire to follow on and to know the purpose of His grace more fully.<a name=65:8></a> I merely assert that in their present state they could not be in the testimony.<a name=65:9></a> The little ones in Israel were not involved in their fathers' forfeiture of the land, when they had abandoned the calling of God or their proper testimony.<a name=65:10></a> But they were not competent witnesses; only Caleb and Joshua were in the testimony in that day.<a name=65:11></a>

		The most devoted preacher of the gospel might not be in the testimony, and always when this great service becomes the one object, then the testimony is either overlooked, or is of little interest.<a name=65:12></a> When the benefit of man is paramountly before the servant, he often, unintentionally but assuredly, judges of everything in relation to it, and though he might not say in so many words, 'What is the good of the testimony to the lost

	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us look wider.<a name=66:6></a> Do we not find many christians whose one idea in serving the Lord is the conversion of souls?<a name=66:7></a> And when it is so, I ask again, can the heart exclusively set on the serving of man consider for, or be consistent in any way with, the testimony of the Lord?<a name=66:8></a> They may have light as to the blessing of believers meeting together to remember the Lord in His death, but if they do, this is for their own or the christian's benefit, as the other service is for the unconverted, so that these two embrace all that is required for a true and a full profession on earth.<a name=66:9></a> Alas!<a name=66:10></a> this approaches very closely to the idea of the church in christendom, that it is the congregation of the faithful, where the gospel is faithfully preached, and the sacraments duly administered.<a name=66:11></a> The testimony is entirely lost sight of.<a name=66:12></a> It is plain to be seen how a doctrine of this kind, however tacitly accepted, must allow or excuse the enjoyment of worldly things.<a name=66:13></a>

		A believer is not in the testimony because he retires from the outer or political world, while he accepts and indulges in the things of the world which exalt him personally.<a name=66:14></a> The testimony is so unique, so distinctly characteristic of the rejected Lord, that any one in the testimony would refuse everything which would tend to his distinction here.<a name=66:15></a> The comforts of food and covering he would thankfully accept as absolutely necessary, but the dress or the furniture which would connect him with the fashion of the hour he would

		In conclusion, we must distinguish between those who are earnestly seeking to be true to the christian calling, really growing into the testimony, however slowly, and those who, while professing to be in it, are insensible to the nature of the practice which it demands.<a name=67:13></a> The seller of jewellery might be pressing on in true and rapid strides to the testimony, but he cannot be in it.<a name=67:14></a> He who seeks a livelihood by selling things for man's glory is surely not in the testimony, however he may approve of it in heart and long to be in it.<a name=67:15></a> If he has a true sense of what becomes a follower of Christ now, he could not make a gain by inducing any professor to adopt what was wholly inconsistent to the testimony.<a name=67:16></a> Some then may exclaim, 'Who then is in the testimony?<a name=67:17></a>' I answer that though they are few, we are not for that reason to lower the standard.<a name=67:18></a> That, as I have said at the beginning, has ever been the snare of the adversary.<a name=67:19></a> 'As it is so hard to keep it up', he would say, 'let us reduce

		In reviewing the ways of our God, the one great impression made on us is this, that He will bring into full light, with very positive evidence, what is His mind at the time; so that if I have His word, I may rest assured that it will obtain a hearing in one way or another.<a name=70:9></a> In every instance we see that if there is not simple faith in God, and unwavering integrity in adhering to it, the ways and influence of those we might have counted on will surely hinder us.<a name=70:10></a> If we have the word of the Lord, we must be satisfied to find that our help is only from Him.<a name=70:11></a> Daniel and his three friends would have utterly failed, even though they had the word of the Lord, the truth for the moment, if they had not had faith in God.<a name=70:12></a> How could it be possible that in Babylon, with the greatest power on earth arrayed against them, they could be heard?<a name=70:13></a> They were so convinced that there was no help from man that in everything they turned to God only, be it in declining the king's bread and the king's wine, or in enduring the fiery furnace; and the result was that the effort of the enemy to extirpate or silence the word of the Lord was the very means used to proclaim it; and all Babylon rang with it.<a name=70:14></a>

		The word of God is a lamp to our feet and a light to our path.<a name=73:2></a> It is by His word that every believing soul is enlightened; and as he walks in it with integrity of heart, he finds it is a path of shining light which shines more and more unto the perfect day.<a name=73:3></a> As we walk in the light we advance in it; but if we accept it, and then grow insensible as to God's claims upon us because of it, and end by refusing it, we become blinded.<a name=73:4></a> Concerning faith we have put away conscience and we are wrecked.<a name=73:5></a> It is to be noted the readiness there is to receive truth, while there is no purpose of being controlled by it.<a name=73:6></a> Thus we see in each of the first three examples of the effects of the word in <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#4">Mark  4</a>, that even when it was received with joy there was no real work in the conscience.<a name=73:7></a> The reason of this is that the truth has been received as mere information and as human learning, instead of as light from God to direct one how to walk and behave oneself on the earth according to God.<a name=73:8></a> If the word of God is accepted, ignorance cannot be pleaded; and if it does not act on the conscience and walk, there must be either dullness, perverseness, or blindness.<a name=73:9></a> When there is dullness, it is because the word has not been received in power.<a name=73:10></a> It is in the hearing that the dullness really is, as the apostle says, "dull of hearing".<a name=73:11></a> Consequently he expounds the word more fully to them.<a name=73:12></a> But when it is blindness, it is marked by stumbling, like a man losing his way in a fog.<a name=73:13></a> The cause of this necessarily is that when one accepts truth in any measure, it leads him into a new path, in which he endures only for a time; he loses his way, like the man who began to build the tower and had not sufficient to finish.<a name=73:14></a> Lot accepted the path of faith for a little time, but when he was diverted from it by seeking a present advantage, he became blind, and he

		There have always been, as far as we know, two lights, since the call of Abram, or since a definite path was prescribed for the people of God on the earth, one of faith, and the other of sense.<a name=77:13></a> There have been two companies, both professing to follow the one path or rule; but one, however feeble, clung to it in faith, while the other, though professing to adhere to it, yet continually betrayed that they were doing so because they considered it the right thing, without any exercise of faith as to it.<a name=77:14></a> Let us then gather from Scripture how these two companies are distinguished the one from the other, the traits and eventualities which mark them.<a name=77:15></a> In faith, Abram answers to the call of God.<a name=77:16></a> It does not say that Lot had faith, for faith is counting upon God, but he went with Abram.<a name=77:17></a> These two were types of the two lines which, as far as we know, have continued ever since.<a name=77:18></a> Abram counted on God, and though he turned

		into Egypt because of the famine, he was restored, and entered on the path of faith again.<a name=78:1></a> Lot accompanied Abram into Egypt, and returned again with him to Canaan; he evidently thought it the right course.<a name=78:2></a> But when it came to be a question which side he was to go, we see a marked difference between these two, the man of faith and the man of sense.<a name=78:3></a> Abram, though the senior, and the one naturally entitled to make an election, surrenders it, and Lot avails himself of it, and chooses the well-watered plain, which his good sense told him was the best place.<a name=78:4></a>

		Faith looks to God, and waits for Him; this marks one.<a name=78:5></a> The other, while accepting the path, grasps everything which natural wisdom or good sense can lay hold of or utilise, without openly and distinctly abandoning the path.<a name=78:6></a> The fact that it is sense, and not faith, which influences is more apparent at every step.<a name=78:7></a> The wonder is what could have induced a man without faith to enter on such a course.<a name=78:8></a> But it is this, the judgment may be convinced of the rightness of a course, without the faith which counts on God.<a name=78:9></a> In this way, many a christian has been induced to leave the establishment for some sect which promised to secure him the field or liberty his intelligence demanded.<a name=78:10></a> What really was the difference between Moses and Aaron, two brothers bound together by all natural ties, and now appointed by the Lord to the same service, and both largely acquainted with the work of the Lord?<a name=78:11></a> Truly Moses derived everything directly from the Lord, and then shared His communications with Aaron, who was the public expounder and herald of them.<a name=78:12></a> Both were in the same path; but Moses, as it was shown eventually, was in it in simple dependence on God, while Aaron, who was the more prominently connected with it, in the moment of difficulty gave way entirely to the dictates of his senses, and declared that he had no faith in the nature of the God whose word, accompanied with great signs and mighty wonders, he had so often proclaimed.<a name=78:13></a> Could any divergence as to

	<div class="paragraph">
		One could hardly believe that such an unaccountable and painful breach could arise between two brothers so closely bound together in the work of the Lord.<a name=79:2></a> Alas, the fact proves to us that there are two guides where one might least expect to find them, and that no amount of light, or co-operation of work or service, can prevent the great moral gulf between them; for one has faith in God, and the other, in the hour of trial, turns to his senses and the exercise of his natural ingenuity.<a name=79:3></a> The man of sense in the right path will command a greater company of followers, because the natural mind is swayed by natural force.<a name=79:4></a> The man of faith can only address the faith of others, and he influences only in proportion as there is faith.<a name=79:5></a>

		We are taught a similar lesson in connection with the twelve spies.<a name=79:6></a> They all had the same service; they had the same opportunities and the same light and knowledge; and yet, when it came to definite practice, ten of them, while dilating on the good of the land and its unquestionable excellencies, had no faith in God.<a name=79:7></a> They brought up an evil report of the land, declared that it was "a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature".<a name=79:8></a> They had plenty of natural sense and judgment, they observed things as they are on earth and with man, as natural sense must do -- the keener it is, the more so.<a name=79:9></a> Faith counts on God, and sees Him above and beyond all that man is; and hence Caleb can say, "If the Lord delight in us, then he will bring us into this land".<a name=79:10></a> The great instruction for us is that one can see the good and beauty of the truth, in company too with those who have simple faith in God, and yet not only have no heart for it, but actually become

		The way to obviate the effects of this laxity is, by deed and ways, to insist on the only true testimony, namely, that the one united company of believers, the body of Christ, is called to maintain His name here.<a name=88:7></a> And His name cannot be maintained except as one walks in His Spirit, the greatest of bonds, but yet the one most easily disturbed.<a name=88:8></a> If I am in any way worldly and unsanctified, I am a hindrance to the unity in which each member of His body should be found here, in divine co-operation, to represent Him where He is not.<a name=88:9></a> Hence the great characteristics of the faithful company to the end are, "thou hast .<a name=88:10></a>.<a name=88:11></a>.<a name=88:12></a> kept my word, and hast not denied my name".<a name=88:13></a> Let there be <i>every</i> encouragement for the Lord's people to be on the same ground, with a view to unity, for they are united; but let not laxity or grieving of the Spirit of God be sheltered under the plea of unity; that would be to make it an engine wherewith to destroy itself, and really to prevent the very thing which is proposed to be attained.<a name=88:14></a>

		Let us admit our responsibility.<a name=124:9></a> We are called to be lights in this world, holding forth the word of life.<a name=124:10></a> This is general, but the moment we, by act or word, take any place of prominence, most blessed when in true interest for the well-being of the flock, it is ineffectual or worse if not supported, and our title to it assured, by moral weight.<a name=124:11></a> By moral weight I mean the effect of the word of God on me, and how I am governed by it.<a name=124:12></a> If it does not govern myself, who avow that I have accepted it, how can I expect it to sway those whom I desire to accept it?<a name=124:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We must see and hold in faith our calling before we can understand a division.<a name=128:1></a> A division is a breaking away from our calling, and it must be known and followed in order to mark those who cause divisions and offences among you contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned.<a name=128:2></a> We shall look at our calling first in its varied phases.<a name=128:3></a>

		OUR STANDING
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Individually, by grace, through the work of Christ, "as he is, so are we in this world", and because we are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts crying, "Abba, Father".<a name=128:4></a> In the eye of the Father I am in this world as His own Son is at His right hand, and in my own heart enjoying the greatness of my relationship.<a name=128:5></a> This is the true standing of each believer individually, while corporately we are all baptised by one Spirit into one body, and we have been quickened together with Christ, raised up together, and made to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.<a name=128:6></a>

		OUR DUTY IN THE HOUSE OF GOD

	<div class="paragraph">
		First, to gather to the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=129:1></a> For though the Holy Spirit dwells in the house and each believer is His temple, there is a very important addition to this -- "where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them".<a name=129:2></a> As the ark of the covenant or as the Urim and Thummim were essential to Israel in the days of their faithfulness, so is the presence of the Lord to those in any measure true to Him.<a name=129:3></a> Thus each one would be under His ordering, and worship and edification would be the result of coming together.<a name=129:4></a> Then everything unsuited to His house, every one practically unfit to be recognised as a member of Christ's body, would be put away, or in the event, as alas!<a name=129:5></a> it has happened, that 'canker' was tolerated in the house of God, then there would be no option but to purge oneself from the vessels to dishonour, while following with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart, so that still there might be, as it were, a spot in the house according to the mind of God; and every one acting faithfully to Christ in separating, would really conduce to the blessing of those from whom they had thus separated.<a name=129:6></a>

		THE TESTIMONY
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is very simple and attractive to the devoted heart, but very exacting and arduous to human feelings.<a name=130:5></a> It is comprehensively expressed in the words, "Whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus".<a name=130:6></a> Nothing could be more gratifying to a heart true to an absent one than the obligation to do everything in His name; yet it involves so much, that maintaining His name in any measure evokes every evil force against us, even the wicked spirits in heavenly places, because it insists on the life and ways of a heavenly man on earth, to walk even as He walked.<a name=130:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having given this very brief sketch of our calling, I now turn to note how divisions occur.<a name=130:8></a> It must be plain to every godly soul, when the calling in all its parts is so entirely new and outside of man's tastes, that unless he walks in the Spirit he is in danger of being as is described in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3:3">1 Corinthians  3:3</a>, "For whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?<a name=130:9></a>" Now the first division on record was caused by Ananias and Sapphira seeking to obtain credit

		in the church by falsely representing the amount of property they had surrendered.<a name=131:1></a> It may be contended no true person would dissimulate after this fashion.<a name=131:2></a> True, but the man who does not see the calling of the church, and yet assumes the position of one seeing it, though not in heart opposed to it, while there is no question as to his right and duty to be there, yet, though not in conscience implicated in Ananias' deception, he is deceiving himself and others.<a name=131:3></a> He is not in a truthful position; he may, like Lot in another day, accompany the man of faith, but if he has not faith, sooner or later he must cause division.<a name=131:4></a> This form of deception was not so probable in the earlier days of the church as now.<a name=131:5></a> There was then but one company known as the church of God.<a name=131:6></a> There was in it a present power to rebuke the carnality of any one opposed to the calling to which he had avowedly attached himself.<a name=131:7></a> In this day of weakness and ruin, the judgment of God is much slower, and hence as there is less fear of Him in His own house, so should there be more holy watchfulness lest any should be induced to obtain credit by accepting a standing which does not truly represent him, because like Lot, though he be in it, he has really no faith regarding it.<a name=131:8></a> It may be retorted that every believer belongs to the church, and is bound to take his place as such.<a name=131:9></a> With this I heartily concur.<a name=131:10></a> But I contend only that there must be faith in adopting your true place if you would have any power for continuance in that place.<a name=131:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not want to debar any one, even the feeblest, from entering on his true place; but while it is simply and positively incumbent on each one, I believe the more I understand the grace of the Lord in awakening His people to their calling and to a sense of their failure in departing from it, the more would I fear to press any one into a position owning the calling, though I would press on him the responsibility of it as a member of Christ; labouring by word, by example, and by prayer, to lead every one of Christ's into it truly, for it is their only true

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we see divisions may occur morally by souls assuming a position, even a true one, beyond their faith; and though the division be not open and patent, yet there is as great a moral distance as if openly avowed.<a name=132:5></a> There are divisions, as with Mark, which arise from fear, and again divisions, as with Barnabas, from giving way to natural affection.<a name=132:6></a>

		Lastly, we are bound to "mark them which cause divisions .<a name=132:7></a>.<a name=132:8></a>.<a name=132:9></a> contrary to the doctrine what ye have learned; and avoid them".<a name=132:10></a> The ten spies who brought up an evil report of the land and discouraged the people are of this class, and in the righteous judgment of God they died by the plague before the Lord.<a name=132:11></a> Caleb and Joshua were very distinctly separated from them.<a name=132:12></a> When acknowledged leaders inculcate by word and deed a course subversive of the truth of the calling, there is division which demands a practical separation on every one that names the name of Christ.<a name=132:13></a> Indeed, any line of teaching which is damaging to the testimony must be classed under this head; and the godly have no option but to come out and be separate and touch not the unclean thing.<a name=132:14></a> Such divisions as these must always entail separation; the Spirit of God is grieved until we are in dissociation from them.<a name=132:15></a> We must purge ourselves.<a name=132:16></a> There are, as we have seen, divisions where a right position is assumed without faith; and there it is the duty of all to bear with and heal, as Paul did with both the Corinthians and Galatians.<a name=132:17></a> But there are divisions contrary to the doctrine we have learned, and then there is no option but to "avoid them".<a name=132:18></a>

		AN INTELLECTUAL RECEIVER OF TRUTH IS AN OPPOSER OF IT
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When two profess to see the same truth, and one pursues a course quite different from that adopted by the other, the judgment is, that as the truth cannot produce two different effects, there must be some great discrepancy as to the way in which the truth has been received, and in this, as in everything else, the natural mind is enmity against God.<a name=133:1></a> The apostle evidently conveys that there are two ways in which truth can be received.<a name=133:2></a> He tells us how carefully he avoided the excellency of speech, in his ministry to the Corinthians, "that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God".<a name=133:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nothing is more calculated to weaken the testimony, and subvert the truth, than that the professors of the same thing, avowedly, should act quite differently, and be practically estranged from one another; so that there is a way of receiving a doctrine which unintentionally creates a marked opposition to it, like the Pharisees in our Lord's day.<a name=133:4></a> That this is the case no one can deny.<a name=133:5></a> Hence it is incumbent on us to ascertain the cause of it.<a name=133:6></a> Now as the carnal mind can accept a divine truth formally, beyond one's faith, and as this is at an immeasurable distance from faith in the power of God, which alone grasps the truth of God in its divinity, it becomes plain that the effect of truth depends on the way in which it has been received.<a name=133:7></a> How could the natural mind entertain any idea beyond itself?<a name=133:8></a> It must confine everything it grasps within its own range.<a name=133:9></a> The moment it travels beyond the human ken, it has passed the limit of man's apprehension.<a name=133:10></a> "The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:14">1 Corinthians  2:14</a>.<a name=133:11></a> "For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him?<a name=133:12></a> even so the things of God

		It is very remarkable that coincident with the church's decline there has been, as we have seen, an attempt to seize the truth of the mystery in a human way.<a name=137:10></a> Thus the unique importance of it is admitted, and therefore it is the more necessary that we should ascertain what it is when received by faith, in the power of God.<a name=137:11></a> The first step of faith in the power of God, with regard to the mystery, is that the Holy Spirit has come down from heaven to testify of Christ in heaven.<a name=137:12></a> There are two great marks to this testimony; one, that the world is rebuked, and therefore its countenance not accepted.<a name=137:13></a> The other, that Christ is glorified, and His things, heavenly things, are revealed and disclosed.<a name=137:14></a> The more distinctly and profoundly this great truth is held in the power of God, the more surely and correctly will be seen how the saints on the earth are by Him baptized into one body.<a name=137:15></a> It is always from not apprehending this great fact that there has been error, and a mere human reception of the mystery.<a name=137:16></a> No natural intellect could grasp the nature and effect of the Holy Spirit's residing here, and hence no one can in his intellect grasp the unity of the body; but if my faith is in the power of God, as to this first step, the second follows, that, beyond all human

		Now the gospel, according to the instructions given to Paul (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#26:18">Acts  26:18</a>), transfers the believer from one state to another, and the state to which he is transferred has a twofold blessing: one, the remission of sins; and the other, "inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me".<a name=187:11></a> The Son comes to do the will of God.<a name=187:12></a> He dies, "the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God".<a name=187:13></a> "Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood .<a name=187:14></a>.<a name=187:15></a>.<a name=187:16></a> for the remission of sins", thus to release us from the misery and judgment in which by nature we are plunged; and not this only, but to set us, by the Holy Spirit given to Christ on high, in heavenly joys, in the blessedness of Christ's life here; so that we have not to wait for those joys, but in the very spot of our misery, we have an earnest of the inheritance which is ours now by faith in Him.<a name=187:17></a> The gospel sets the believer free before God, from all that was against him as belonging to Adam, and as to state in this world, as Christ is now in glory.<a name=187:18></a> He

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In pattern, the Lord qualified His disciples for the assembly in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:19">John  20:19</a>, before there was any revelation of the mystery.<a name=189:4></a> The presence of the Holy Spirit and being gathered together to the name of the Lord, ensured a corporate order, though the mystery was not as yet known.<a name=189:5></a> This is very important; that the church should be in divine order, and in the unity of the Spirit, before the truth was known which would have made the order still more obligatory (see <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:46">Acts  2:46</a>, 47).<a name=189:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In a word, the church as the house of God on earth was known before the body was revealed; and when discipline was necessary the apostle recalls the Corinthians to the ground they were on as the assembly.<a name=189:7></a> They were to come together in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the power of our Lord Jesus Christ -- "holiness becometh thine house, O Lord, for ever" -- yet he afterwards in chapter 12 enforces this responsibility by insisting on their corporate relation to one another.<a name=189:8></a> The knowledge of the one body, and that this body is the body of Christ, is the mystery, or the ministry of the church.<a name=189:9></a>

		I have touched on these varied shades, arising from the same imperfect vision, or apprehension of how the end of the first man has come.<a name=198:2></a> In the fulness of time God sent His Son, born of a woman, born under the law.<a name=198:3></a> John's announcement of Him was, "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world".<a name=198:4></a> Mark here, it is the <i>sin</i>, not merely the <i>sins</i>; and hence, in another place, it is said "to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself".<a name=198:5></a> Now the epistle to the Romans details the whole work for the sinner believing in Christ.<a name=198:6></a> In chapter 3 we find, "whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood .<a name=198:7></a>.<a name=198:8></a>.<a name=198:9></a> for the remission of sins .<a name=198:10></a>.<a name=198:11></a>.<a name=198:12></a> that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus".<a name=198:13></a> Hence follow <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#4:7">Romans  4:7</a>, 8: "Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.<a name=198:14></a> Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin".<a name=198:15></a> Not only are the evil deeds forgiven, but the sin is not imputed; and this is assured, because righteousness is imputed, consequent on the resurrection of Christ from the dead.<a name=198:16></a> Thus the sinner is brought to God in perfect peace -- all Christ's work -- and he is set in a new region, the other side of death, on the new ground, through the resurrection of Christ, where righteousness reigns, and consequently peace.<a name=198:17></a>

		"In me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing".<a name=199:5></a> This is an immense advance on admitting that sin is in me.<a name=199:6></a> Thus the flesh, the principle of sin -- its will -- is no longer to be owned by the believer as alive.<a name=199:7></a> It has been met, not by pardon, but by death.<a name=199:8></a> Sin is condemned in the flesh.<a name=199:9></a> True, he often feels that it is alive; but he is to reckon himself dead to it, and has no right to return to it, because it has been set aside in the cross for God, and He -- God -- never reverts to it again with regard to any one in Christ, for every one in Christ is a new creation.<a name=199:10></a> The old man is dead in Christ, or rather through Him.<a name=199:11></a> In Christ I am free from it; hence, "if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live".<a name=199:12></a> God, in His grace, has placed the believer in Christ, and it is his privilege now to say, "The life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me".<a name=199:13></a> The old man having been removed righteously in judgment, the blessed God has translated us from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of the Son of His love; and now, in His life and nature, we have put on the new man, which after God is renewed in knowledge after the image of Him who has created him.<a name=199:14></a> We are now not debtors to the flesh to live after the flesh.<a name=199:15></a> I am crucified with Christ; that is, the old man is.<a name=199:16></a> If I return to the flesh now in any measure, I return to that which has been judicially terminated in the death of Christ.<a name=199:17></a> It has

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Son of God comes into this world, and He is the Lamb of God to take away <i>the sin</i> of the world.<a name=202:4></a> He comes from God's side.<a name=202:5></a> The man under trial, and seeking to attain, comes from his own side.<a name=202:6></a> When God acts from His own side, only His Son could clear everything away from fallen man, worthily of God; so that the believing sinner is brought to God.<a name=202:7></a> He really has nothing to do but to rest the eye of faith on Him who has removed from the eye of God for ever all that offended.<a name=202:8></a> It is not only forgiveness of sins; and hence sin is not imputed, but there is a judicial termination of the body of sin in the cross, and the believer is perfected for ever by the offering of the body of Jesus once.<a name=202:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Many a believer in this day, though knowing that salvation is only through the work of Christ, is unconsciously on the ground of work or attainment, and he seeks relief for his conscience, by bringing Jesus as an all-sufficient offering to God: but as the relief is not permanent, he is obliged to recur to this act again, and he really does not see that God has come forth in gift; that where sin abounded, grace doth much more abound; and that the grace does not merely cover the ruin, but has greatly abounded over it.<a name=202:10></a> "For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:17">Romans  5:17</a>.<a name=202:11></a>

		Secondly, let us note the difference between the heavenly stranger as typified by Abram, in the work of faith, and one who is the heavenly stranger by the gift of grace.<a name=204:8></a> Abram was called out to be a stranger in the land of promise, but he got nothing but as he acted in faith.<a name=204:9></a> There was a certain reward attached to a certain act.<a name=204:10></a> Hence he was always succeeding, when in faith; but if he failed in faith, he lost everything previously gained, as for instance, when he went down into Egypt, and which was in a sorrowful and full degree exemplified in Lot.<a name=204:11></a> But the heavenly stranger now possesses everything before he is a stranger in act.<a name=204:12></a> As he accepts in faith what is his, he is in the enjoyment of it, and this throws him into strangership here, but his enjoyment does not make it his, nor can he lose it because of unbelief, though he be as destitute morally as one who has plenty of treasure in his house but lives in penury.<a name=204:13></a> Hence there

	<div class="paragraph">
		Thirdly, let us look at the difference between Israel entering the land, and the man in Christ.<a name=205:11></a> Everything depended on their act.<a name=205:12></a> They must go in and possess the land.<a name=205:13></a> True, God brought them in, but they had to act in order to possess, and those who went in without faith did not remain possessors.<a name=205:14></a> Now the believer is united to Christ, and is in full title and ownership of the heavenly places before he enjoys any of it.<a name=205:15></a> True, as he accepts in faith the portion which grace has given him, the greater is his sense of possession and consequently of his enjoyment.<a name=205:16></a> In the one case the act was necessary in order to obtain possession; in the other, there was as much title before enjoying possession, as there was consequent on possession.<a name=205:17></a> If I only possess heaven in proportion to my act of faith, as was the case with

	<div class="paragraph">
		We all know the tendency there is in our hearts, and often in proportion to our earnestness, to be on the line of attainment, instead of being simple recipients; and it is well for us to note the difference in state which the effort to attain produces, from that which grace or the acceptance of gift produces.<a name=206:9></a> One who is in the former is never even; he is elated at any sense of his progress, and depressed if he becomes conscious of his losing ground, though generally he is too well pleased with his own engrossment of desire to advance, and obtain more.<a name=206:10></a> In the other, in proportion as the grace is simply held, there is great evenness.<a name=206:11></a> There is ever a sense of being far behind in enjoying the vastness of what has been conferred; and there is the greatest thankfulness for a sight of it, while with each new acquisition, there is the sense that 'the draught which lulls our thirsting awakes our thirst anew' .<a name=206:12></a> The one is like a man making a fortune; while the other is exploring the vastness of the gift bestowed on him; one necessarily is occupied with

		The first great fact is that He continues to work among the people, or line of testimony, where the failure occurred.<a name=207:11></a> When man's sin brought on the flood, God did not revive His work outside of Seth's line.<a name=207:12></a> The line of testimony, Noah, was the one chosen to revive His work.<a name=207:13></a> "Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord".<a name=207:14></a> When failure ensued at Babel, God called out Abram, though Shem's family was involved in the common

	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, when Israel had been many years in bondage, God revived His work.<a name=208:9></a> Where did it begin?<a name=208:10></a> In Moses' parents, where <i>there was godliness, and faith in God</i>.<a name=208:11></a> All Israel is to be blessed and relieved, but the revival begins in the faith of the parents, who hid their son because they "saw <i>he was</i> a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment".<a name=208:12></a> Now this is the second mark.<a name=208:13></a> The first, we have seen, is that God continues with one line, until it has been proved utterly reprobate.<a name=208:14></a> The second is, that He works where there is faith in Him that He will effect His own purpose in contradiction to the world's sway and dictum all around.<a name=208:15></a>

		Again in the day of provocation, the Lord did not cast away Israel, but Joshua of the tribe of Ephraim and Caleb of Judah, who stilled the people, were the chosen of God to revive His work.<a name=209:1></a> They were small in the eyes of men, but true to God's purpose, which is always indispensable in the man for the crisis; and it is interesting to note that Joshua was of the favoured family, the house of Joseph.<a name=209:2></a> Through all the history of the kings we find the same principle.<a name=209:3></a> God did not forsake David's line, but He revived His work, where there was faith, and true purpose to maintain the testimony of the time.<a name=209:4></a> When Christ came, though the wise men acknowledged Him, He connected Himself with the poor, lowly and faithful ones in Israel who sought Him.<a name=209:5></a> Simeon and Anna, in the temple, true to the testimony, are the beginning of the revival of that hour.<a name=209:6></a> He did not forsake Israel even when they said, "This is the heir; come, let us kill him", and cried out, "Crucify him, crucify him", until the nation had condemned itself in the stoning of Stephen.<a name=209:7></a> And then the Lord imparted the light, inaugurated by Stephen, to Saul of Tarsus who was consenting to his death.<a name=209:8></a> I mean He carries on the light.<a name=209:9></a>

		When a breach occurred between Paul and Barnabas, through the dissimulation of Peter, the Lord went on with Paul, because he was faithful to His glory, and the light which he had received.<a name=209:10></a> Silas accompanied him, and Timotheus is given to him at the moment to fill the blank occasioned by the departure of Barnabas.<a name=209:11></a> Thus in the history of the church at any time, it will be found that the Lord succours and supports those who follow on in faith, in the line of His highest interests, or testimony at the time; to the end it is "he that hath an ear, let him hear".<a name=209:12></a> A hidden sin may lead to the discomfiture of the whole company, as it was with Israel in the case of Achan; but God still used Joshua, because he was true to His highest interests; and thus every break-up, sad for the moment, clears the company of the troubling element; and leaves the blessed God at

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second thing is, that it is only in the measure that I am faithful to this light, that I can be any real help to His own, in leading them on.<a name=211:15></a> I must avoid the "bushel" and the "bed" in order that I may duly set forth, for the benefit of the saints, the grace the Lord hath shown me; even though it exposes me, as it surely will, to the opposition of the darkness all around.<a name=211:16></a> My comfort is, that the effectual way to overcome darkness is by the persistent maintenance of the light.<a name=211:17></a> Like Noah in his day; God had shown him great favour in giving him light, and in faith he adhered to it.<a name=211:18></a> He "prepared an ark to the

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is no truth more distinctly insisted on by the apostle Paul than "the mystery of the gospel", the relationship which believers now bear to Christ, as he says, "This is a great mystery", that the church is the body of Christ, and all believers now are the members of His body.<a name=221:5></a> The first great truth to accept in faith is that the church is the body of Christ.<a name=221:6></a> If this is held in simple faith, there can be no question as to the fact of union.<a name=221:7></a> The church could not be Christ's body if it were not united to Him.<a name=221:8></a> It would be only a figure of speech, and not a "great mystery".<a name=221:9></a> The apostle adduces the type of Adam and Eve in order to show that as they were one flesh, so there is a unity now, but of a much greater order.<a name=221:10></a> At all events there is a great point gained when one accepts in faith that the church is Christ's body; and therefore it is

	<div class="paragraph">
		The church is Christ's body and it is in purpose, "the fulness of him that filleth all in all".<a name=222:6></a> Romanism made the church everything, and left out the Head; hence in that system, another head was introduced; but the more truly the church is regarded as Christ's body, the more faithfully will every movement of it be viewed absolutely in relation to Him; and consequently the church comes to no decision but when gathered in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=222:7></a> It is from the Head that all the body, by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, makes increase unto God.<a name=222:8></a> A body can do nothing without its head.<a name=222:9></a> It is from the head all counsel and direction comes.<a name=222:10></a> If it is so in the natural body, how much more so in the great mystery!<a name=222:11></a> It is not competent for any number of christians, majority or not, to act apart from Christ; but any number, however small, directed by Him, determines that which is binding on all, as at the conference in Jerusalem (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#15">Acts  15</a>).<a name=222:12></a>

		To every believer at peace with God, through the work of Christ, it must be a question of paramount interest, What is the church in which he is, and where and how is he to meet according to the mind of the Lord?<a name=227:4></a> If one is not assured by the Holy Spirit of favour with God, into which we have access through our Lord Jesus Christ, one has no real leisure of heart to ascertain which of the many denominations, if any, is owned of the Lord.<a name=227:5></a> But when he is at rest, in the assurance of God's love shed abroad in his heart by the Holy Spirit, he will inquire diligently what is the true way for christians to meet together.<a name=227:6></a> The answer to this interesting question is "For where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:20">Matthew  18:20</a>.<a name=227:7></a> Now this is the simple and unalterable ground for an assembly meeting.<a name=227:8></a> It is the beginning.<a name=227:9></a> The smallest congregation is sufficient to secure the presence of the Lord.<a name=227:10></a> There can be no church meeting which has not this as its basis, for if it has not this, it is, in spirit and nature, independent.<a name=227:11></a> Man acting for God, without the leading of the Holy Spirit, is independency.<a name=227:12></a>

		There are two great elements in prayer: one, that I have the sense of my own need; and the other, that the blessed God has the goodness and power to help me.<a name=245:3></a> These two elements can never be absent from prayer, though a great many other benefits are acquired in prayer.<a name=245:4></a> Thus, the proof that Saul of Tarsus was converted, is, "Behold, he prayeth" -- the opposite of self-reliance, which was engendered at the fall.<a name=245:5></a> It is the language of conversion; a confidence is awakened in the blessed God, a sense that there is good in Him, and thus "God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us".<a name=245:6></a> The sight of Jesus on the cross awakened confidence in the thief, and he prayed unto Him, "Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom".<a name=245:7></a> It is as there is confidence in God awakened in my soul, and a sense of inability to cope with my difficulties, that I turn to God.<a name=245:8></a>

		Now, in the prayer-meeting, we come together to wait upon God that we may be led to act here for His glory, and that the interests of Christ, in the fullest way, may command our attention; the state of souls in every instance, in sorrow, sickness, and sin, with the deepening sense on our hearts of our responsibility to make known the truth of the gospel, not in part only, but the whole truth, the mystery of the gospel.<a name=251:5></a> I believe that when there is a full heart in the prayer-meeting, there must be an earnest entreaty to God that souls may be blessed, and that the good pleasure of His will may be known and followed by the saints; as is said of Epaphras, "Always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God", <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#4:12">Colossians  4:12</a>.<a name=251:6></a> I cannot pray in the assembly beyond my knowledge, but it is a very serious mistake when I think there is nothing to be desired beyond the measure of my knowledge.<a name=251:7></a> I can understand the pastor confining his attention in prayer to the state of souls for whom he is interested; and the teacher to the subjects most on his heart for the saints; and that the evangelist would pray

		I must add a word as to the way holiness is to be secured when there is independency -- that is, open insubjection to Christ in the assembly.<a name=263:2></a> We get an example of this in <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2">2 Timothy  2</a>.<a name=263:3></a> So long as the assembly, though in as bad a state as that of Corinth, has a conscience to respect and to own the presence of Christ, we may always look for recovery; but when the general spirit of the company is lawless, as in <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2">2 Timothy  2</a>, the Lord does not get His place, there is no respect for Him, there is simple insubordination, the most grievous state to which any company of believers can be reduced, when the Lord cannot be there, and every one seeking holiness is to purge himself from vessels to dishonour, not merely from their doctrines, but from themselves, and follow righteousness, etc.<a name=263:4></a>, with "them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart".<a name=263:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we have seen that, whether in our own house, or in the house of God, the lack of holiness, if allowed to go on unjudged, is sure to result, sooner or later, in open departure from the ways of God, or the testimony at the time; and the more advanced one is, the greater will be the exposure.<a name=263:6></a> The reason is self-evident: we grieve the Spirit of God by conniving at what is spurious, or defective, for some supposed advantage; consequently He will not help us, and we become a prey to the enemy in some form or other, generally in the one most to our taste naturally.<a name=263:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The terms objective and subjective are used to express on the one hand what God has done in His grace, and on the other what we are in consequence, or the effect produced by what He has done or given us.<a name=265:1></a> His gift is intended to produce an effect, but it exists before anything is produced by it.<a name=265:2></a> It was objective when God made man in His own image, and, in addition to this, placed him in the garden of Eden, and surrounded him with gifts suited to his nature.<a name=265:3></a> Adam accepted the gifts, but, because he was not subject to what was appointed for him, he forfeited all.<a name=265:4></a> This is the case always with man when set in responsibility; when he does not answer to the gifts conferred on him, he forfeits them.<a name=265:5></a> A believer now does not forfeit the gifts when he receives them in vain, because they are ensured in Christ; but if the gifts do not produce their proper effect, the believer is as if he had forfeited them, for his responsibility is to enjoy them.<a name=265:6></a>

		It was objective when God brought Israel into Canaan, and they were warned that they should forfeit it if they did not retain what had been given to them, on the terms that it had been given.<a name=265:7></a> Hence, though they were set in the land manifestly by the power of God, they did not retain it.<a name=265:8></a> They did not continue in possession in the way in which they were put into possession, consequently they were driven out of it.<a name=265:9></a> A saint now cannot be dispossessed of anything that God has conferred, but if the possession of any of His grace be not retained in the very way in which it was given, the enjoyment will be lost, and he will be as if he had never had it; nay, more, if he ever returns to the enjoyment of it again, it will be with something of the experience of the captives of Israel, returning to the land from Babylon.<a name=265:10></a> Paul writes to the Corinthians, "Receive not the grace of God in vain".<a name=265:11></a>

		THE CHURCH; WHAT IT IS, AND THE LOSS WHEN NOT KNOWN
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first allusion to the church is in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>, where our Lord says to Peter, on his confession that He was "the Christ, the Son of the living God", "Thou art Peter [a stone], and upon this rock [what Peter had said] I will build my church", or assembly.<a name=271:5></a> The word assembly is not a new word, but the structure the Lord would now build is entirely a new one -- one that never existed before.<a name=271:6></a> The Rock on which this new assembly was to be built had only now come.<a name=271:7></a> Here we have the important truth, that the construction of this new assembly would be Christ's own work.<a name=271:8></a> Thus Peter's name -- a stone -- suited the statement that he would be material for the new structure; because a stone is of the same order of material as a rock, therefore he would be of this new assembly.<a name=271:9></a> Thus we have, as the Lord's work, not only that He Himself would be the Builder, but that the material would be of the same order as Himself.<a name=271:10></a> Just as, in another place, it is said, "both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one".<a name=271:11></a>

		Now, in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:19">John  20:19</a>, the first assembly of this order is set forth in pattern.<a name=271:12></a> The disciples are constituted for this assembly on the earth.<a name=271:13></a> The Lord, risen from the

	<div class="paragraph">
		So far we see that the church, or assembly, is here as the house of God -- the Holy Spirit with all who call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord; and He also dwells in saints individually, so that there is an easy response from the Spirit in the individual temple, to the Spirit in the collective temple.<a name=272:13></a> In every one filled with the Spirit we have Christ's own building.<a name=272:14></a>

		The next light we get on the church, after <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>, is in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9">Acts  9</a>, when our blessed Lord says to Saul of Tarsus, referring to the church, "why persecutest thou <i>me</i>?<a name=272:15></a>" thus identifying the church with Himself, and speaking of it as Himself.<a name=272:16></a> Thus, His first word to the one whom He subsequently appointed to be a minister and a witness of the things he had seen, and "of those things in the which I will appear unto thee", related to the mystery of the church.<a name=272:17></a> We must turn to Paul's writings to obtain a correct idea of the church, the body of Christ.<a name=272:18></a> Alas!<a name=272:19></a> there is no correct idea of it retained in christendom.<a name=272:20></a>

		In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12">Romans  12</a>we find an allusion to the body of Christ, as if the truth were known, but no unfolding of the mystery, though, in the last three verses of the epistle, it is referred to as something specially commended to them for their benefit.<a name=273:2></a> Now, in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:12">1 Corinthians  12:12</a>: "For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ", we have the body of Christ referred to as a subject well known, on the ground of which the apostle would correct the disorders at Corinth.<a name=273:3></a> The clause, "so also is Christ", would be very indefinite, were it not explained elsewhere.<a name=273:4></a> Doubtless they had heard before that the church was one body, but we could not comprehend the meaning of "so also is Christ", from this allusion, were it not explained to us in Ephesians, where we read, that He is "head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all".<a name=273:5></a> In Corinthians we learn that there is one body, and that we are all baptised by one Spirit into one body; but from Ephesians we learn that Christ is the Head of His body -- His complement, that which completes Him -- that we are placed in Him in the place where He is, and that we have to grow up to Him in all things, who is the Head.<a name=273:6></a> In Ephesians we have the full mystery -- Christ the Head over all things to the church, which is His body, and therefore united to Him -- His fulness.<a name=273:7></a> As we had the new and privileged position of the body in Corinthians, here we have the marvellous dignity of our position, united to the exalted One in heaven, and in His power down here, where He had been rejected; and the greatness of the Head is further opened out to us in Colossians, in order that we may know our great gain; for in this mystery are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.<a name=273:8></a> These treasures are not from the saints, in any number, by themselves,

		but from the Head of the body, from whom all the body, ministered to and united together by the joints and bands, increases with the increase of God.<a name=274:1></a> So that we arrive at this -- that not only is the blessed Lord the Builder, as He says at the beginning, but He is the Head, the almighty Source of all blessing and power, in the nearest and closest relationship which the word Head conveys.<a name=274:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I now turn to the varied ways in which the truth of the church has been perverted.<a name=274:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Doubtless, at first, through carelessness, many unconverted crept in; those were admitted who were not of Christ's building.<a name=274:4></a> There was man's building, as we find in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3">1 Corinthians  3</a>; but so long as Christ's place was owned and submitted to, He came, as we find in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5:4">1 Corinthians  5:4</a>, though the saints there had forfeited His open support and countenance, like Israel at Ai; yet He would still come and help them to get rid of the known evil in their midst.<a name=274:5></a> But when the assembly had sunk into the ungodliness and disorder described in <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:16">2 Timothy  2:16</a>, His place then was not owned, and the true-hearted were to purge themselves from the vessels to dishonour.<a name=274:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As difficult times grew on and existed, there was not a purging from the vessels to dishonour; though it is to be noted that whenever there was any reviving in the church, it was marked by a measure of separation from the existing corruptions and corrupted state of things.<a name=274:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Romanism, in principle, disclosed the great evil working in the church; and that was leaving out the Head, while the assembly was presumptuously invested with the divine prerogative of binding and loosing for <i>heaven</i>.<a name=274:8></a> The power entrusted to the first assembly by the Lord, in John 20, was binding and loosing for earth -- administrative forgiveness; but romanism assumed that the church was invested with power to bind and loose for heaven.<a name=274:9></a> A human rule was substituted for the Spirit of God, and when this obtained, when the only One who could order according to the mind of Christ was

	<div class="paragraph">
		ignored, then Christ's headship of His body, and place in the assembly, was disowned.<a name=275:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in protestantism, the effort was to correct this enormity, by simply returning to Christ as Saviour, which had been lost in romanism.<a name=275:2></a> Thus real good was done at the reformation; the way of salvation was brought to light; but the church, as it is in the mind of God, and revealed in Scripture, was not at all apprehended.<a name=275:3></a> Hence, in the reformed church, various denominations arose, each one aiming at a recognised membership, which was not part of the order of the reformed church at first.<a name=275:4></a> We can see in this movement (the membership of a church) a vague idea of the body; but there was really no approach to it, but a lulling of the conscience as to the real thing, from accepting a human mode instead of the divine one.<a name=275:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Later on arose the proposal, hailed by some, that all christians should lay aside all the peculiarities of their church arrangements, and come together for mutual prayer and edification, apart from any prescribed rule.<a name=275:6></a> This did not satisfy the more godly, because they naturally asked, If it were possible to come together for <i>one</i> week, why not for many weeks -- why not for our whole time here?<a name=275:7></a> No doubt, many were prepared in this way for the light which the Lord was pleased to make known some sixty years since, which was hailed as an unspeakable boon by them.<a name=275:8></a> The Lord led one of His servants to see that believers in Christ have a Head in heaven, and thus that one Head makes one body.<a name=275:9></a> Thus the truth of the great mystery was restored to the church, and what could not be found in the books of the most godly for eighteen hundred years, from that time was in writing, and <i>viva voce</i> proclaimed to the people of God.<a name=275:10></a> If there had been no divergence from this great truth, or rather, if it had been held in simple faith in its integrity, there would have been no divisions among those who professed to hold it; but when the test came, those who really had not the truth of the mystery, that is,
	</div>

		<a name=276>[Page 276]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the greatness of the Head, and in consequence the unbounded measure of the church's resources and power, were betrayed; while the really sorrowful part of the division was that each section claimed to be gathered on the truth of the church.<a name=276:1></a> Christ is the Head of the church always in the eye of God.<a name=276:2></a> There is one body, fitly joined and compacted together, however scattered and distant one from another the integral parts.<a name=276:3></a> The fact is, that many were gathered on the truth that we are all baptised by one Spirit into one body.<a name=276:4></a> This had been accepted as thoroughly satisfying hearts that longed for the true membership of saints, but it is evident they had not faith in the Head, and therefore they really had not by faith accepted the mystery; because, when independence broke out, they had no power to resist it; and they could not see that they were as responsible to rebuke an offence done to the Head by those who were a thousand miles off, as if it had occurred in their own company.<a name=276:5></a> The bond had been accepted, but the power to maintain them divinely in this bond had not been laid hold of by faith.<a name=276:6></a> Hence division ensued.<a name=276:7></a> Those who had some faith in the Christ remained faithful to Him; the others, while professing to hold the same truth, were apart, and really on different ground.<a name=276:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are besides this, other ways in which the truth of the church as the Christ is practically ignored, even by those still retaining professedly the right ground.<a name=276:9></a> The first, and most common, is, when Christ, for one's own individual blessing, is exclusively before the soul.<a name=276:10></a> When this is the case, the service never goes beyond the gospel; and in evangelical ardour, one feels excused or exonerated, for inattention to or ignorance of, the church.<a name=276:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, there is another form, even more deceptive, where one is so engrossed with one's own feelings, that there is a continued effort to be self-commended as a christian.<a name=276:12></a> This is often marked with great fervency and feeling, which is mere religiousness, and from which, as we see in Colossians the earnest believer, at rest about

		his soul, is preserved only by the truth of the church being laid hold of by faith, which leads him to know Christ in him as everything, and in all.<a name=277:1></a> Thus it was that holiness by faith had its origin, and it is generally betrayed by the way the feelings are acted on.<a name=277:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I might enlarge on these various ways in which the truth of the church is lost, but I merely notice them, and close by referring to another which is more specious, and therefore the more dangerous; I mean when the truth of the Ephesians is held intellectually, which is always the case when the position in which God has set us is <i>exclusively</i> spoken of, leaving out the great power which, in His grace, He has attached to this great position.<a name=277:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I need not add more than the assured belief, that if the mystery, as it is in the mind of God -- "the Christ" -- were, even in a little measure, the centre of all service, there would be the deepest joy of heart, and power for usefulness.<a name=277:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The first state, and ever the one increasing in depth and fulness in the soul, is what is called conversion -- my eyes opened, turned from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God.<a name=277:7></a> The work of Christ in His death and resurrection must be known before there can be any advance in stature or growth.<a name=277:8></a> Often years are spent in reaching the state of the babe.<a name=277:9></a> Babes know the Father.<a name=277:10></a> There is no lower stage, historically, than a babe.<a name=277:11></a> Saul of Tarsus reached it in three days; but the deepest exercise is necessarily endured in the translation, by the mighty power of God, from the power of Satan unto God.<a name=277:12></a> Israel's deliverance out of Egypt typifies the history of this stage.<a name=277:13></a> The conversion often seems quick and sure;

		<a name=278>[Page 278]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		yet, sooner or later, there must be a known sense in the soul of how God has wrought; that He has loosened all the cords with which the enemy had bound us; that He has broken his power on every side.<a name=278:1></a> There is not a ray of hope left, there is not a straw for the ruined soul to cling to.<a name=278:2></a> The thief on the cross, or the Philippian jailer, or Saul of Tarsus, or any one, is brought to a point where the interminable darkness of eternal judgment stares him fully in the face.<a name=278:3></a> "Refuge failed me"; "No man gave unto him".<a name=278:4></a> The better I learn this part of my history, the stronger babe I am, and the better shall I be able to advance; therefore much depends on this period of one's history.<a name=278:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first great relief to the soul is the deep, everlasting assurance that the blood of Christ shelters me from the judgment of God.<a name=278:6></a> Now, if, consequent on this relief, I enter into the judgment that Christ bore for me at the hand of God, if I feed on the lamb roast with fire, and with bitter herbs, a deep repentance, an utter sense of judgment deserved -- "we indeed justly", as the thief on the cross expresses it -- I am, in heart and purpose, on my way out of Egypt, my loins girded, and my shoes on my feet, and my staff in my hand.<a name=278:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here, I am persuaded, the first snare after conversion occurs.<a name=278:8></a> The grandeur of God's goodness and power in breaking down the enemy all around me -- "not a house where there was not one dead" -- in order that I might seek to be sheltered by the blood of His own Son, is beyond my power to describe .<a name=278:9></a> But I am sure some who have enjoyed the shelter of that blood have not really left Egypt.<a name=278:10></a> They have not fed on the roasted lamb with bitter herbs.<a name=278:11></a> They have not entered into what Saul passed through, the three days when he neither ate nor drank.<a name=278:12></a> If I have not a sense of the terrible judgment that awaited me, and that I deserved, I do not appreciate the greatness of the work of Christ in bearing my judgment; for if I had done so, I must make haste indeed to leave the place where I had incurred the judgment of God.<a name=278:13></a>

		"Now is the judgment of this world".<a name=279:1></a> One is converted when he rests by faith in God's estimate of the blood of Christ; one is not in the consciousness of a child -- does not know the Father, until he has learned the grace which has placed him on entirely new ground outside Egypt.<a name=279:2></a> The mark of the soul not out of Egypt is that his religion is to make what is sure still more sure -- that he is clear of judgment.<a name=279:3></a> He does not really fear it, but every work and religious exercise is appreciated in proportion as his sense of security is increased.<a name=279:4></a> The feeling that he is really safe is his chief joy; and every blessing he receives, and every good done, is valued as it conduces to increased assurance.<a name=279:5></a> Often there is much comfort derived from the feeling that one is more holy, and this in itself weakens the work of grace, while it lends a certain cheer to the soul which is not yet at peace with God.<a name=279:6></a> Many, with much injury to souls, have pressed that a soul has peace when it knows forgiveness.<a name=279:7></a> This is not true.<a name=279:8></a> There is assurance of escape from judgment; an assurance, too, that may never be lost, even though that soul may never leave the world where the judgment is.<a name=279:9></a> I have dwelt long on this period, but it is of immense importance.<a name=279:10></a> Hence, in the type, from <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#12">Exodus  12</a>to 15, we learn in detail what those three days were to Saul of Tarsus.<a name=279:11></a> He so learned the death and resurrection of Christ in those three days, after enduring in soul much more than Israel in that desperate time, he found that Christ had so cleared everything of the Egyptian, or, in other words, of the man under judgment, that he could be at home in the glory, where his Saviour was.<a name=279:12></a> He was justified, he was at peace with God, and the Holy Spirit assured him of his freedom from the law of sin and death.<a name=279:13></a> He was a babe of an entirely new race.<a name=279:14></a> Now the mark of a babe is delighting in relationship, like the prodigal in the father's house.<a name=279:15></a> I am in favour; the love of God is shed abroad in my heart by the Holy Spirit given unto me.<a name=279:16></a> I am saved now by my Saviour's life, and I joy in God; this is a great era in my history.<a name=279:17></a>

		Now in the history of some souls there is faith as to the resurrection of Christ from the dead, and thus a sense of justification, yet without full liberty.<a name=280:1></a> Saul, I might say, had arrived at this before the Holy Spirit came; it is He who makes me free from the law of sin and death.<a name=280:2></a> I am not only counted righteous, placed, through grace, before God, as Christ is, raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, but I am in a new state -- "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death".<a name=280:3></a> The order of history is, that it is the law of this new life made known to me by the Spirit, which assures me of deliverance from the law of sin and death.<a name=280:4></a> In the type we see that Israel was over the Red Sea long before they had learned, in connection with their utter depravity, the boundless grace of God.<a name=280:5></a> Israel, after thirty-nine years of unparalleled favour, from day to day, now spake against Him and His servant.<a name=280:6></a> They prove they are totally irreparable, not a good feeling in them.<a name=280:7></a> Then the brazen serpent is put on a pole, and not only a new life given by faith to every sufferer, but also water is given them.<a name=280:8></a> Thus, in type, there is life in Christ, and the Spirit given to maintain us in the enjoyment of that life.<a name=280:9></a> It is thus that liberty is known -- "where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty".<a name=280:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, when there is a sense of peace because of being justified by faith, and yet not full liberty or deliverance, it is because the Spirit is not the acknowledged power, the distinct opponent to the flesh; so that we have not only to live in the Spirit, but also to walk in the Spirit.<a name=280:11></a> When, historically, a soul has reached justification, and yet is not in liberty, while there is a rejoicing in the glorious work of Christ, and, as prefigured in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15">Exodus  15</a>, a desire to see God honoured on the earth, with a sure prospect of reaching heaven in time, there is more or less return to the law, and one's trials are all connected with the wilderness.<a name=280:12></a> It is things of earth which engross one, a longing for the leeks and onions of Egypt, even though there be not a return to Egypt openly.<a name=280:13></a> Alas!<a name=280:14></a> this is a very

		The snare, or danger, at this stage of my history is lest, as we read in Colossians, I should be beguiled by enticing words.<a name=282:1></a> It is evident that in such a case the natural mind would be acted on, and the consequence, as we see there, would be that a mixture of rationalism and ritualism is adopted, or a religiousness, giving some place to the man in the flesh.<a name=282:2></a> It is amazing the variety of shades in which this evil appears and at this stage.<a name=282:3></a> Intellectualism at one time, and excited fervency at another time; always something mental or sentimental; nothing in itself immoral, but so absorbed with my own feelings and ministering to them, that I am not subject to the word of the Lord, and thus I am not divested of any hindrance that crops up in me from having "part" with Him in the new place whither He has gone, and to which He leads me, when I am freed by Him of the soil which would unfit me for it.<a name=282:4></a> If I do not rise to conscious enjoyment of Christ in the place where He is, after I have reached this stage, it is because my feet are not washed.<a name=282:5></a> But when I do, I learn that I am united to Him, and thus only can I be preserved from the religiousness of the flesh; and the same Holy Spirit who has shed abroad in my heart the love of God, now unites me to my Saviour where He is, making known to me that I am indeed a member of His body, of which He is, over all things, the Head.<a name=282:6></a> I am not only transported with joy, but I begin to realise the immensity of the position which I, through grace, now occupy.<a name=282:7></a> I do not see how any human language could convey the blessedness of the stature in which my history culminates.<a name=282:8></a> I am now to grow up to Him in all things, who is the Head -- the Christ.<a name=282:9></a>

		THE ASSEMBLY; ITS USE AND OBJECT
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Our blessed Lord, taking His place in the midst of His own on the day of His resurrection, and there and then forming the assembly for the first time on the earth, would of itself convey to us the gravity and importance of it.<a name=297:1></a> The disciples (the eleven, and they that were with them), were gathered into a room, with closed doors, the Lord Himself the one paramount Object before their hearts.<a name=297:2></a> He comes into their midst, and He now forms the assembly.<a name=297:3></a> He first fits the disciples for it, assures them of peace -- the state belonging to the new ground -- that of divine righteousness, in which He now sets them.<a name=297:4></a> He confers life in the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=297:5></a> He sends them as missionaries into the world, and He announces to them their responsibility, in the words, "Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained".<a name=297:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The assembly is now shown in pattern.<a name=297:7></a> I do not say that it commenced then, but I submit that the pattern of it was given then.<a name=297:8></a> The value of a pattern is that we have in it the essential parts of the thing described.<a name=297:9></a> The Lord, on the first day of the week, when everything is new, places the disciples, both as to their own state and responsibility, as He desired to have them, in assembly order.<a name=297:10></a> No soul, unless in the spiritual mind, which is life and peace, is really qualified to fulfil his part in the assembly.<a name=297:11></a> It is plain that if my own soul's interests are not assured, and that I am not in real restfulness of heart about myself, I cannot truly take an interest in Christ's interests in the assembly.<a name=297:12></a> But being settled, as to myself, before God, now I am called to act for Christ in the assembly.<a name=297:13></a> Invigorated in heart by His presence, His death prominently before me, I travel through remembrance of His death to the great fact that I am beside Him, that He is in the midst; while absorbed by His presence, I learn from Him that I am sent by Him into the world, and that our responsibility is set forth in

		the words, "whose soever sins", etc.<a name=298:1></a> So that the present position of every one is determined by the assembly receiving or refusing.<a name=298:2></a> If we apprehend, in any measure, that the object of the assembly was to care for the interests of Christ on earth, we at once see how much it has departed from its object and use, while it is our blessing to seek from Scripture how we may return, in purpose and practice, to the mind of the Lord.<a name=298:3></a> We may lay down, then, that the Lord's presence, and its effect, is necessarily the first object and use of it.<a name=298:4></a> Secondly, the way He directs and sends forth from there for His service; and thirdly, responsibility as to remitting and retaining sins.<a name=298:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, seeing that the assembly is here for objects so deeply interesting, let us gather from Scripture more about it.<a name=298:6></a> In <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:20">Matthew  18:20</a> we read, "For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them".<a name=298:7></a> Here we have the basis of the assembly.<a name=298:8></a> Two or three would be as nothing without the Lord, but He in our midst -- everything must be rightly determined.<a name=298:9></a> From the context it is evident there was a sense of powerlessness, and this led to prayer; but we were not to be despondent, for where two or three were gathered to His name, He would be in the midst; that is, He, in His grace, would form one of the company, when they were simply gathered to His name.<a name=298:10></a> The Spirit only could gather to His name, and He, the blessed Lord, will then come Himself.<a name=298:11></a> This is the basis of every meeting on divine ground.<a name=298:12></a> There is no power otherwise, and thus, in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24">Luke  24</a>and <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>, the Lord is in the midst of His gathered ones, then only to form in pattern that assembly which is now in existence.<a name=298:13></a> We see in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:17">Matthew  18:17</a> that the assembly was the last place for appeal in personal difficulties with one another, in our wilderness journey; and this affords evidence of the use and object of the assembly.<a name=298:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>the disciples were in company when the Holy Spirit descended, and filled the house where
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=299>[Page 299]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		they were sitting; and, besides, each individual was filled by the same Spirit who had filled all the house where they were sitting.<a name=299:1></a> The assembly, so to speak, was then established in true power; surely Christ was in the midst.<a name=299:2></a> It is a great thing to apprehend the nature of the assembly which is the habitation of God through the Spirit, as here begun.<a name=299:3></a> It was there each individual at first received the Spirit.<a name=299:4></a> The greatest blessing of the time is connected with the assembly.<a name=299:5></a> If we bear in mind that the descent of the Holy Spirit was not on one here, and another there, scattered abroad, but first to the assembly, possibly the same number as in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:19">John  20:19</a>, we must be impressed with the august nature of it; and that a manifestation of the Lord would occur there which would not occur elsewhere.<a name=299:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now a very important fact, which is entirely lost in christendom, must be added here -- namely, that once in the assembly, I am always in it.<a name=299:7></a> I cannot properly say that I am going into the church, or that I am going to church.<a name=299:8></a> It is quite true the assembly meets, or it may be convened; but I am a constituent part of the assembly, at my work, as well as at the convened meeting.<a name=299:9></a> In Israel an assembly was called by trumpets, which I conclude has given rise to bells in the christian era; but the assembly meeting there was in order to provide for some apprehended difficulty.<a name=299:10></a> With christians the assembly is convened also, according to the necessity of the times; and, I conclude, also with the twofold intention of receiving comfort and help to the saints, and guidance and wisdom, under the circumstances, from the Lord.<a name=299:11></a> Surely thus it was in the beginning.<a name=299:12></a> "They continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers".<a name=299:13></a> "All that believed were together".<a name=299:14></a> "And being let go, they went to their own company".<a name=299:15></a> "And when they had prayed, the place in which they were assembled shook, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and spoke the word of God

		with boldness".<a name=300:1></a> It is important to note how blessing is connected with the assembled saints.<a name=300:2></a> It would appear also that Ananias and Sapphira came to the place where the assembly was gathered.<a name=300:3></a> Ananias had come in first, and in three hours after, his wife, "not knowing what was done, came in".<a name=300:4></a> The Holy Spirit was connected with the assembly, and hence Peter can say to Ananias, "Why has Satan filled thy heart that thou shouldest lie to the Holy Spirit?<a name=300:5></a>" Again, we read in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#6">Acts  6</a>that when there was a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration, then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples to them.<a name=300:6></a> Thus we grow into some apprehension of the use and object of the assembly.<a name=300:7></a> The interests of the Lord were to be secured there.<a name=300:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13:1">Acts  13:1</a>, 2 we get a very interesting use of the assembly.<a name=300:9></a> "As they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them".<a name=300:10></a> This occurred in the assembly, and it recalls to us one of the great things connected with the first assembly, in pattern (John 20: 21) when our blessed Lord said, "As my Father hath sent me, even so send I you".<a name=300:11></a> That is, that servants were appointed to definite services in the assembly; as it is said of Timothy, "the gift that is in thee, which has been given to thee through prophecy, with imposition of the hands of the elderhood".<a name=300:12></a> This, doubtless, occurred in the assembly.<a name=300:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We get another interesting statement in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#15:4">Acts  15:4</a>: "And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them".<a name=300:14></a> The assembly is evidently here the central object, and not the apostles and elders; and we find in the same chapter, after the apostles and elders had discussed the question of circumcision, and had arrived at the Lord's mind about it, the assembly endorsed it.<a name=300:15></a> "Then pleased it the apostles and elders, with the whole

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, in <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:4">1 Peter  2:4</a>, 5, 9: "To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious, ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.<a name=301:2></a>.<a name=301:3></a>.<a name=301:4></a>.<a name=301:5></a> But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light".<a name=301:6></a> Here we get the twofold use of the assembly; one to God, offering up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ; the other, setting forth the excellencies of Him who hath called us out of darkness into His marvellous light.<a name=301:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To this I must add the counsel to Timothy, "that thou mayest know how one ought to conduct oneself in God's house, which is the assembly of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth".<a name=301:8></a> Surely a godly soul, on reading the above quotations from the Scripture, will be impressed with the august nature of the assembly.<a name=301:9></a> It may be alleged, and truly, that the assembly now has, to man's eye, lost all trace of its primitive greatness.<a name=301:10></a> This will be readily admitted, but, at the same time, we must remember that its object, and the use for which it was formed, are the same as ever, though there be a marked inability in answering to them.<a name=301:11></a> No creature of God can lose its responsibility as to the object and use for which God formed it; however, from injuries or internal weakness, it may become incapable of conducting itself as it ought; still, the responsibility remains, and this is all I would press; while I am encouraged by the assurance that, however powerless the assembly has become, to any heart which is really set for instruction as to the interests of Christ, there will be given now, as surely as to Nehemiah or Daniel in another day, both light and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I must add a few remarks on the assembly as the body of Christ.<a name=302:2></a> We must bear in mind that every believer in the assembly is a member of the body of Christ, and that, when convened as in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>, because of the intimate connection between each, that if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; if one member is honoured, all the members rejoice with it.<a name=302:3></a> They are there gathered by the Spirit to the name of Christ, in whose name He (the Spirit) was sent by the Father; and consequently each member, in faith holding the Head, which he must do to be true to his responsibility, is really led by the Lord to behave himself in the house of God, and to carry out the mind of the Head there and then.<a name=302:4></a> The apostle adduces the truth of the one body to the Corinthians, to awaken them to their responsibility, and to deter them from merely doing their own pleasure in the assembly.<a name=302:5></a> Now mark, that not only are the saints edified in the meeting, but, "if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14:24">1 Corinthians  14:24</a>.<a name=302:6></a> This great blessing was not effected by the assembly being the habitation of God through the Spirit, but by the present energy of the Spirit, through the members of the body of Christ.<a name=302:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord grant that we may apprehend a little more clearly the use and object of the assembly as it is in His mind.<a name=302:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One word more as to the mystery -- the church as one great structure on the earth, of which Christ is the Head in heaven.<a name=302:9></a> I speak of it now, not merely convened, as in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>, but as we get in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:15">Ephesians  4:15</a>, 16:

		First, then, the sinner, though suffering from his sinful distance from God, does not want to see the full nature of that distance because the more he sees it, and the real nature of it in the sight of God, the more oppressed he must be under the conviction that he could not avert the judgment of God, though the more sensible of deserving it.<a name=305:5></a> Consequently, a sinner in his state towards God differs from the ordinary debtor towards his fellow-man.<a name=305:6></a> The ordinary debtor would at least like to rid himself of an intolerable load.<a name=305:7></a> He looks carefully into his accounts, and sets himself steadily to accept the best terms he can get for liquidating his debt; he would like to know the full extent of the claim, and he longs to be clear of it.<a name=305:8></a> The sinner knows that there is a claim, and a just one; but he does not like to investigate closely its full extent, and still less to open his eyes to the startling fact, that he has "nothing to pay".<a name=305:9></a> Hence the way of grace is entirely unknown among men; for if one forgives his fellow, or a parent a child, or a sovereign a subject, it is preceded by a petition to that effect from the offender.<a name=305:10></a> The offender admits his guilt, and seeks pardon and restoration to his former position, whatever that might have been.<a name=305:11></a> The sinner hates to own his guilt, or to look in the face the judgment so justly imposed on him.<a name=305:12></a> He hates to touch the question at all, as to its real character; and even though religious, he declines to see himself beyond what his own good works would effect for him.<a name=305:13></a>

		If we do not see the immense difference between the sinner, with respect to God, and any ordinary debtor, with respect to his creditor, we cannot understand the course and action of the grace of God.<a name=306:5></a> It is an unknown thing among men that any creditor should cancel the debt, when there is no wish for it on the part of the offender.<a name=306:6></a> Again, we must bear in mind that no one could be under the same penalty to his fellow as the sinner is to God.<a name=306:7></a> I might murder my neighbour, and the law would in justice, require my life; but though that is the most any man could require from me, for that is my all, yet, with regard to God, though I die, I do not by my death set myself right with Him, and cancel the sin on account of which I have incurred death, because I <i>remain</i> under the judgment when I <i>fall</i> under it.<a name=306:8></a> Unless my relations with God are re-established before death overtakes me, I must remain under the doom which has come upon me, through death.<a name=306:9></a>

		It is plain He must not only save him from judgment, in some divine way -- for no ordinary way could effect it; but He must produce an appreciation in the heart of the sinner, even faith in the work which has been done.<a name=307:2></a> The blessed God must not only remove the sinner s distance from His own side, and according to His own satisfaction, but He must awaken and enlighten the sinner as to the real nature of His goodness and love.<a name=307:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We start, then, with the amazing fact, that it is God -- the One who has been offended and abandoned -- who is the only One that moves in the salvation of the sinner.<a name=307:4></a> The sinner will not move.<a name=307:5></a> God follows Adam!<a name=307:6></a> Let the heart conceive the magnitude of that, of the love that follows a beloved fallen creature, in order to save him, and to bring him into the happiest relations with Himself.<a name=307:7></a> Can we understand the love of God, the manner of that love, which is the greatest, deepest governing principle, when there is goodness, seeking to obtain all it desires, when sin is in the object of the love?<a name=307:8></a> This is perfect love in perfect holiness.<a name=307:9></a> The love is determined to reach and recover its object, while holiness insists that it cannot be done but in perfect holiness.<a name=307:10></a> The holiness is divine, as well as the love.<a name=307:11></a> The love could not enjoy itself if it secured anything at the expense of the holiness.<a name=307:12></a> But now, in order to secure holiness, there must be first righteousness for the guilty.<a name=307:13></a> Holiness gives stability to the love; every expression of it is in perfect holiness, and therefore there can be no deviation from any expression of it.<a name=307:14></a>

		The subject for our contemplation is how the blessed God can place the sons of men, now under judgment because of sin, and alienated from Him by wicked works, according to His delight.<a name=307:15></a> There are plainly two great works to be effected ere this great consummation can be attained.<a name=307:16></a> The first is, that He is able, through the intervention of Another, to regard the sinner quite clear,

		according to His own idea of clearness; that is, that He can justify him.<a name=308:1></a> The other work is in the sinner, so that he surrenders his enmity, and, in an entirely new feeling, draws near, and accepts the grace of God that brings salvation.<a name=308:2></a> Until this consummation is reached in this twofold way, we cannot seize or understand christian standing.<a name=308:3></a> The blessed God -- as we see in the garden of Eden -- resolves, according to His nature, to retrieve man's lost condition in His own way, and we are told at the outset how it is to be effected.<a name=308:4></a> When Adam admits his transgression, God not only announces the way He will effect salvation for man, but, as a significant expression of His heart, He clothes both of them with skins, necessarily procured by the death of the animals; that is, setting forth figuratively that God will recover man, through sacrifice, from the ruin of judgment under which he is placed.<a name=308:5></a> His holiness is inexorable; they are driven out, but thus clothed, they wear the significant token of divine grace.<a name=308:6></a>

		How little do we enter into the way the blessed God has sought to express His heart compatibly with His glory; that is, with all His attributes; to express His heart towards man who had sinned, and come short of His glory, and had thus distanced himself from Him.<a name=308:7></a> In the way God treated Adam and Eve, the great principles which governed Him came out.<a name=308:8></a> His purpose was to save.<a name=308:9></a> They carry the assurance of this with them in a twofold way.<a name=308:10></a> God had, in a figure, commended His love to them.<a name=308:11></a> The purpose of God is, not merely to rescue from judgment, as benevolence would do to a great sufferer, but to place him in the happiest relation to Himself.<a name=308:12></a> It is not as a sovereign seeking to effect an amnesty and full pardon for his rebellious subjects, but God, who follows man to his hiding place, and calls to him, "Where art thou?<a name=308:13></a>" This is not even a father's heart going out after an erring child, but the eternal God, not ashamed, as I might say, to declare that He <i>willeth not</i> the death of a sinner; that it is not merely the comfort or gain of the

		Let us briefly review God's dealings with man.<a name=309:2></a> For fifteen hundred years after the fall man was left to himself.<a name=309:3></a> God was not unmindful, for before the seventh fell under the judgment of death, He arrested it in the person of Enoch; and this man, the seventh from Adam, was not only the trophy of grace as to salvation, but he was also a sample of the man restored to God -- not merely acquitted and justified, placed without a charge before the great Executive, but he walked with God; and "he was not; for God took him".<a name=309:4></a> We are told he "pleased God".<a name=309:5></a> Here you have a man, before the judgment on man was confirmed by a complete number, "translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.<a name=309:6></a>.<a name=309:7></a>.<a name=309:8></a>.<a name=309:9></a> He that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him".<a name=309:10></a> Enoch not only believed, but he believed in God's nature.<a name=309:11></a> Now this is a main point, because it is the very reversal of the act of the first man in the garden of Eden, who would not give God credit for His nature, even that He is the <i>Rewarder</i> -- not a Saviour merely, not merely justifying the ungodly, but a <i>Rewarder</i> (mark the word!<a name=309:12></a>) and a Rewarder, not for good works, but for an acknowledgment of a verity, even what God is in Himself.<a name=309:13></a>

		Now when violence covered the earth, God brought a flood of waters upon it.<a name=309:14></a> It repented the Lord that He had made man on the earth, and it grieved Him at His heart: "all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.<a name=309:15></a> And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth".<a name=309:16></a> Noah and his house are saved in the ark; all the rest died.<a name=309:17></a> "All flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#7:21">Genesis  7:21</a>.<a name=309:18></a>

		Here is a great crisis.<a name=310:1></a> Man in the flesh has proved an utter failure, but grace comes in, and Noah and his house are saved -- covered in the ark (figuratively the death of Christ) -- so that there is no flesh to be seen on this universe.<a name=310:2></a> All flesh was either drowned in the waters of judgment, or covered in the ark, and we may safely conclude that it is a type of the far greater salvation and judgment, when our Lord says, "Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the prince of this world be cast out.<a name=310:3></a> And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me".<a name=310:4></a> But Noah, saved from judgment finds access to God through the altar of burnt-offering.<a name=310:5></a> Noah enters on a new history on the earth where he was a few months ago, not only saved from judgment by the ark, but now, out of judgment, he is in the favour of God, and he is His central object of interest here on the earth, though as a man he was nothing better, "the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth".<a name=310:6></a> The great thing we learn from Noah's history is, that God not only saves, but that He secures man's happiness and prosperity in the very spot where he had failed; and this, not only for man's own sake, but because it is a matter of interest to Himself.<a name=310:7></a> The more one dwells on this, the more is the heart filled with adoration to Him for making us objects of His interest.<a name=310:8></a>

		Now we come to law.<a name=311:2></a> It is not possible to understand the value of the law, or the necessity for its introduction, if we do not bear in mind that there is a determined unwillingness in man to own himself a lost, guilty sinner; and, were it not for the law, many would persist in their boast, that they had done nothing wrong.<a name=311:3></a> "By the law is the knowledge of sin".<a name=311:4></a> Man generally must admit that he has broken the law in some way or another; and he that offends in one point is guilty of all (<a href="../bible/James.htm#2:10">James  2:10</a>).<a name=311:5></a> Breaking the law is not the entrance of sin, it is the exposure of what exists there already.<a name=311:6></a> True, in a case like Saul of Tarsus, there was no self-condemnation, because his own conscience was his only judge.<a name=311:7></a> He had not come before God.<a name=311:8></a> As soon as the light of God's presence shone round about him, he fell to the earth -- he had no standing before God; he finds "the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin".<a name=311:9></a> The law set forth what God required of man, if he were to live here on the earth according to His pleasure.<a name=311:10></a> There could be no proper order here on earth, unless the righteousness of the law was maintained; but as by the deeds of the law should no flesh be justified in His sight, the very moment the law was given, and in the same scripture (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#20">Exodus  20</a>), the altar is given, where it is said, "In all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee".<a name=311:11></a>

		I would now turn to the gospels, and gather from them the nature and measure of the new place, or standing, which the blessed Lord set forth in pattern -- the result and object of his work.<a name=313:8></a> In Matthew, Mark, and Luke the Lord first shows how He can lift off every pressure that lay on man.<a name=313:9></a> There are, I might say, three great sections in His work: first, that of relieving the sufferers of their sufferings.<a name=313:10></a> People were greatly attracted to Him, until He, by sending the swine into the deep, indirectly condemns their surreptitious way of evading the law, by making merchandise of swine which they must not eat.<a name=313:11></a> Then they prayed Him to depart out of their coasts.<a name=313:12></a> There was, first, then, the simple relief of the actual suffering, irrespective of the moral state of the sufferer.<a name=313:13></a> Next, the sufferer is not only relieved, but he is in heart attracted to the Lord.<a name=313:14></a> See the Legion -- he was not only relieved, but he desired to be with Him.<a name=313:15></a> Thirdly, the woman in the Pharisee's house was forgiven her sins.<a name=313:16></a> This is moral.<a name=313:17></a> The man that fell among thieves not only finds a Saviour, but is set on His own beast, and cared for at His expense for evermore.<a name=313:18></a> The prodigal is brought to the Father's house; forecast of what was to come.<a name=313:19></a> And, lastly, through His death, the thief, from the lowest place with man is brought to the highest place with God, where the blessed Lord Himself is.<a name=313:20></a> Could anything

		CHRISTIANITY
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christianity began when the Lord Jesus Christ rose from the dead, but was not established until the Holy Spirit came down <i>from Him glorified</i> at God's right hand.<a name=318:5></a> The nature of it had many foreshadowings, dating from the fall of man, and the beauty and power of it were exhibited by Jesus, the Son of God, on the earth.<a name=318:6></a> In order to understand christianity, we must begin with the counsel of God.<a name=318:7></a> Before the world was, the blessed God had purposed to head up all things in Him who is the Christ.<a name=318:8></a> The first thing for us to apprehend is that God had a Man in His purpose -- as we read in <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#8">Proverbs  8</a>-- "always before him".<a name=318:9></a> The Man, according to this purpose was in His mind before Adam was created, in the likeness and image of God.<a name=318:10></a> It is of the utmost importance to be assured that God had a Man in His purpose before Adam was created, or before there was any failure of that order.<a name=318:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, this being admitted, we shall see that, as soon as Adam fails, God has a Man to fall back on, not only to repair the ruin effectually, but to "destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil", by whose instrumentality the ruin of man was caused.<a name=318:12></a> It is a very remarkable coincidence that Jesus, in effecting the redemption of man, would utterly annul the power of evil, by which the man had fallen.<a name=318:13></a> Hence the words of the Lord God to Adam, after his fall, are of the deepest significance.<a name=318:14></a> The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head.<a name=318:15></a> In death, in the judgment, when the Man in reserve should have His own heel bruised in the suffering of death, He should bruise the serpent's head;

	<div class="paragraph">
		We must bear in mind now, that, during the entire interval of man's probation, the servant of God, who was in His secret, looked forward to the Man of God's purpose.<a name=319:3></a> Wherein any servant, through the work of the Spirit, acted for God outside, and independently of man on the earth, then, as recorded in Scripture, he was a type of Jesus, the Man who was to come, who was to bear the judgment of the first man -- bring him historically to an end in judgment, and institute a man of an entirely new order.<a name=319:4></a> You get in Enoch a type of Jesus Christ as He was to God.<a name=319:5></a> He walked with God, and "before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God".<a name=319:6></a> This prefigured what He was personally to God; while in Noah there is the judgment of all flesh, and he and his house only saved.<a name=319:7></a> That is, you get the other side -- man's ruined state, and grace coming in through one Man.<a name=319:8></a> I need not pursue this most interesting study, tracing the features of the coming Man -- Christ Jesus -- feebly prefigured in every servant of God, according as he was faithful.<a name=319:9></a> It is enough to say that the Old Testament abounds with types of the coming One; be it an Isaac received from the dead by Abraham; a Joseph, by Jacob, after having accounted him dead for years.<a name=319:10></a> No doubt Moses longed for this Man, when he cried, "Shew me thy glory".<a name=319:11></a> It could not have been shewn then, except the "back parts", but it was to come in the One in whose FACE it would beam in divine and perennial brilliancy.<a name=319:12></a> Solomon, in figure, was this Man to David, and hence from <a href="../bible/Psalms.htm#16">Psalms  16</a>and 110, Peter can unfold in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>the history of this, the second Man.<a name=319:13></a> The evidence of His coming is not only conclusive, but overwhelming, as one reads down Scripture; for though the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first mark then of deliverance is that as I am free from that wherein I was held, I am not occupied with it, but with sowing to the Spirit, who maintains me in Christ's life, the life wherein I have my freedom.<a name=342:7></a> This is very important, because if we do not walk in the Spirit, we shall wander to the flesh, and there is never liberty when walking in the flesh.<a name=342:8></a> This result (we shall find as we proceed) must never be departed from, for if it be, there is then no progress.<a name=342:9></a> The Spirit is always for progress, and He preserves me from the intrusion of the flesh, which once did enslave me.<a name=342:10></a> A delivered soul is characterised by the paramount place the life of Christ holds in him.<a name=342:11></a> <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>, from verse 12, describes his state: "we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh".<a name=342:12></a> "For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.<a name=342:13></a> For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.<a name=342:14></a> The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God".<a name=342:15></a> I need not here recite all the untold blessedness of a son of God on earth in the midst of the most incongruous circumstances, while he himself is weak personally, and opposed; and all because of the Spirit of Christ who dwells in him.<a name=342:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the practical result consequent on this is, as we see in chapter 12, that the body is the Lord's; presented a "living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service".<a name=343:1></a> This can be true only of a delivered soul.<a name=343:2></a> If there be not freedom from the old master -- the flesh, in the power of the Spirit, there will not be a real true surrender of the body to the Lord.<a name=343:3></a> It is easy to see that if I have a new Master, I am, according to my renewed mind, glad to be governed by Him; and no longer to be in the fashion of this world, but totally transformed according to "that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God".<a name=343:4></a> This result can never be reached apart from deliverance.<a name=343:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is sorrowful the varied attempts which are made to attain to the manner of life proper to one really free.<a name=343:6></a> Many who know well that no amount of good works could secure their salvation, find satisfaction for their consciences in what they <i>do</i>, in seeking to walk acceptably to God, according to their idea of His requirement.<a name=343:7></a> Now it is the real thing that alone fully exposes the counterfeit.<a name=343:8></a> The saint really free, does not seek by his own works to commend himself to God, but in liberty, he walks in the Spirit, and is supported by Him in every step here, whether in trial, weakness, or opposition; and as he does, he is a light in the world for the Lord; he is not trying to be so, as an ascetic, but, set free from himself, he in divine power overcomes evil with good.<a name=343:9></a> If there be not deliverance there cannot be its true results.<a name=343:10></a> One might know much, and be much endowed, like the Corinthians; and yet not be in deliverance.<a name=343:11></a> One who can indulge himself like a Corinthian is not walking in deliverance, even though he may once have experienced it; but if he were walking in the liberty wherewith Christ had made him free, he would shrink from every intrusion of the flesh, whether to indulge it, or to improve it.<a name=343:12></a> "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty".<a name=343:13></a> I might surrender property and position for the Lord, and yet not have this liberty; and unless I have it, I cannot progress into what He would lead me to.<a name=343:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=344>[Page 344]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this liberty, as I have already pointed out, has a twofold effect; one inside -- the believer's inward life; and the other, his outward or practical life.<a name=344:1></a> And mark how one progresses when there is this liberty.<a name=344:2></a> If I am in it, I look up at the Lord's glory.<a name=344:3></a> "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.<a name=344:4></a> But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#3:17">2 Corinthians  3:17</a>, 18.<a name=344:5></a> I am at home there and transformed into the same image; and then I can accept that the dying of Jesus shall determine everything in my body.<a name=344:6></a> "Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:10">2 Corinthians  4:10</a>.<a name=344:7></a> It is now, not only that I am free from the law of sin and death, but I approve of practical death to everything in me for which Christ died; and God helps us when this is our fixed purpose.<a name=344:8></a> Hence -- "we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake".<a name=344:9></a> I am not only set free from the flesh which had dominion over me, but I now deny it when it would arise or intrude.<a name=344:10></a> Now unless deliverance be known, one cannot come to this result.<a name=344:11></a> How could I be free to look at the Lord's glory, and be sensibly affected by its power, if I were not in liberty?<a name=344:12></a> and, as I behold His glory, my deliverance is more assured; for in it I am transformed, and there is no recognition of the flesh there; I am sensibly in a new and divine order.<a name=344:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now while, on the one hand when we are in liberty because of the ministration of righteousness, we can look at the Lord's glory and partake of its blessed effects, another confirmation of deliverance is, that we can enter the holiest.<a name=344:14></a> We have boldness to enter, and we come in, a consecrated priesthood.<a name=344:15></a> In the one, the ministration of righteousness, I find the liberty in which I can approach, and that the glory, instead of repelling me, transforms me into the Lord's image; and in the other, the holiest, I enter into my place with God.<a name=344:16></a> One

	<div class="paragraph">
		The effect of deliverance is very apparent in service.<a name=345:2></a> I admit that there may be gift when there is not deliverance.<a name=345:3></a> But probably a gifted man not in deliverance will do one of two things; either keep wide of the subjective side of the truth he presents, or present it in a legal way.<a name=345:4></a> In the former case he may never have had the sense of needing deliverance; in the latter he has, and his conscience is not at ease.<a name=345:5></a> It is always a refuge to the conscience to exact what it does not possess.<a name=345:6></a> What is possessed is presented as the outcome of grace, and not as a mere demand.<a name=345:7></a> One who feels it right to be heavenly makes an effort to be so; but the one who really enjoys his heavenly portion, knows and presents the great gain of it; one dwells on the obligation, and the other on the gain.<a name=345:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, I trust we have arrived at this, that if there be not deliverance there is no advance.<a name=345:9></a> The Spirit is ever for growing up into Christ.<a name=345:10></a> There may have been the sense of justification, but the flesh is ever ready to intrude, as at Corinth, or in Galatia, or at Colosse; and if I am not walking in the Spirit there is no progress.<a name=345:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe the brazen serpent to Israel in Numbers 21 in type sets forth to us deliverance; that is, freedom from the old man in whom the poison of sin is, who has been condemned in the cross.<a name=345:12></a> No one is really subdued until he learns in himself that "in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing".<a name=345:13></a> Nothing but the sense of sin in me, of what my nature really is before God, can produce this; no amount of trial or sorrow; and therefore it is only as I have the sense of this poison of my nature, that I either seek deliverance, or could appreciate it.<a name=345:14></a> Thus, in the type, when the people were bitten of the fiery serpents after betraying the incorrigible evil of their hearts, there is the sense of receiving life in that he that looked lived; and there it was that they drank of the water given to them; typically, in the power of the Spirit, they entered on a new path, even onward to Canaan.<a name=345:15></a>

		And further; as I enjoy freedom, I shall like, not only to be dead to sin, but also to be dead to the world.<a name=346:1></a> It is impossible for one to be in the sense of freedom from the flesh, and not to seek to avoid everything which would minister to it, which <i>all</i> of the world does, not its evil only.<a name=346:2></a> The delivered one sows to the Spirit, seeking the things that are above.<a name=346:3></a> It is remarkable how one finds these two characteristics in every spiritual person, every one truly walking in the Spirit; even that he dreads the flesh with ever increasing intolerance of it, and at the same time he seeks to enter more and more into the things of God; "for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God".<a name=346:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, as in the type, Israel entered on a new journey from BEER, where they sang, "Spring up, O well", so we, in the power of the Spirit, enter on a new day, and a heavenward journey, when we have learned that we are "dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord".<a name=346:5></a> Then it is that we are in heavenly life and power ready for Jordan, when deliverance is fully known.<a name=346:6></a> We can then in spirit part company from all here; we are dead to the world, to God we are beside ourselves.<a name=346:7></a> There is no feeling of deprivation, for we are in more enjoyment of the Lord personally.<a name=346:8></a> There is no spirit in us while we are entranced with the association with which we are favoured.<a name=346:9></a> We are first free from the law of sin and death, and the more we enjoy our freedom, the more we shrink from everything which would bring us into bondage; and then, led of the Spirit, we travel through Jordan.<a name=346:10></a> Death to everything here becomes easy to one thus led, for

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The full result follows.<a name=347:6></a> As a worshipper inside, I render the tithes, the heavenly tribute here on earth; and as a soldier, I am "strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might", to stand against the wiles of the devil.<a name=347:7></a> So that full deliverance is not only that I am free from the law of sin and death, but I am across the Jordan.<a name=347:8></a> I have died with Christ in spiritual experience; and now I am enabled to maintain for Him in heavenly regions, growing up into Him in all things, so that He should be expressed down here where He had been rejected, in His heavenly beauty.<a name=347:9></a> When I am walking in full deliverance, a heavenly man, the old man is supplanted, and Satan's power is overborne; and then, and then only, am I in true testimony, and in real happiness.<a name=347:10></a>

		From Adam to Christ, the work of grace in every man of God was to be faithful to God in the circumstances in which he was placed, God acting by him, and for him; but when the Son became a Man, the very nature and ways of God were manifested in the Son of man down here.<a name=356:9></a> Nothing of the sort could ever have been seen in a man before.<a name=356:10></a> There was One now here who always did the things that pleased God.<a name=356:11></a> He was not trying to stand for God on this or that occasion, but He was in Himself a contradiction to everything that was not of God, as the light in the darkness.<a name=356:12></a> He was the exhibition of every divine beauty in every detail of His life.<a name=356:13></a> The life with the Father was manifested unto us; and that in the One who, because the children were partakers of flesh and blood, "likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage".<a name=356:14></a> There is no reinstating of the first man; there is no attempt, as with servants of God up to this, to take the kingdom by violence; now the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than any who had preceded.<a name=356:15></a> Hence, in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4:14">John  4:14</a>, our blessed Lord announces to the woman of Samaria, one who was reduced to the most pitiable condition, that through the <i>gift</i> of God she should have a new wonderful history in the very scene of her former misery.<a name=356:16></a> "Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall

		The order of growth to this is very interesting.<a name=364:4></a> We first know His love in dying for us; and then, like Jonathan, whose soul "was knit with the soul of David", we are in heart bound to Him for the great and eternal service which He has rendered to us by His death for us.<a name=364:5></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here I must remind my reader that the church is spoken of in a twofold way in Scripture, namely, as the house of God, and as the body of Christ; and it is very essential that we should comprehend it in these two aspects.<a name=365:3></a> In the house aspect it is the habitation of God through the Spirit, and as such it was committed to man's responsibility.<a name=365:4></a> It was the sphere where sins were remitted.<a name=365:5></a> The true building is Christ's own work.<a name=365:6></a> He says in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>, "<i>I will</i> build my church".<a name=365:7></a> Each living stone is put into its true place by Christ Himself.<a name=365:8></a> This is the church or assembly in its executive character here on earth; and as such, it was committed to the hands of His people here, "the pillar and ground of the truth".<a name=365:9></a> But on the other hand, the house of God has become like "a great house", where there are vessels, "some to honour, and some to dishonour", <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2">2 Timothy  2</a>.<a name=365:10></a> Through the subtlety of Satan and the remissness of the saints, "there are certain men crept in unawares".<a name=365:11></a> It is still the house, but when it has reached the state of a "great house", the one caring for the church purges himself from the vessels to dishonour, not to pursue a solitary or isolated path, but to "follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart".<a name=365:12></a> Thus it is here intimated that there would always be in the house those who preserve what is due to God in His own house; and any one who does not comprehend this course, and act according to it, could not truly care for the church.<a name=365:13></a> Further on, I hope to refer to the twofold character of the Shepherd's care for the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In its essential state the church is baptised by one Spirit into one body.<a name=366:2></a> Christ is the Head of it.<a name=366:3></a> But as the house of God, there is individual responsibility, though that action, when of the Spirit, cannot be independent of the other members of the body.<a name=366:4></a> The body is never visible, the act of the individual is.<a name=366:5></a> Therefore the assembly, as a habitation of God, is the place where the concerns of Christ in connection with this scene are determined; while the essential state (that of the body) upholds and strengthens each individual in acting for the Lord, though visibly he is only a unit.<a name=366:6></a> The house is Christ's council during His absence; and every one built thereon by Himself is a member of His body, and has essentially a corporate position of the highest order, to which each individual, as he is in the Spirit, must defer; because Christ is the Head, and one cannot defer to the Head without embracing every member of the body for its good.<a name=366:7></a> In like manner, when he fails, he disregards the Head, and all the members suffer.<a name=366:8></a> If a saint does not understand the church in these two aspects, he cannot on the one hand see it in its unchangeable nearness and value to the Lord Jesus Christ, as God's present object on the earth; and on the other hand, if he does not see how it has become like a "great house", and how the name of God has been dishonoured in His own house, as it was in Israel of old, he cannot rightly care for it, because he does not apprehend the nature of the position which the faithful must adopt in such a crisis.<a name=366:9></a> In the one case he does not see the unceasing interminable flow of grace from the Head to the body, ever and always, whenever and wherever the members of His body seek Him, and own His rightful and natural place in relation to them.<a name=366:10></a> It is an unfailing consolation to everyone caring for the church, that Christ's heart is the same towards it now as it was when He uttered <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>, and

		Having learned what the church is in the mind of God, there are next two things in many varied branches which will engage the one who cares for the church, as directed by Him, and in communion with Him.<a name=367:4></a> The first is food, or teaching; the second, discipline.<a name=367:5></a> We cannot fail to see that these two are closely connected, and that the growth and blessing of our brethren is the one object common to both.<a name=367:6></a> We start with this, that we arc to love one another as Christ has loved us, and "this also we wish, even your perfection".<a name=367:7></a> Once we ascertain the great principles which are to guide us in caring for the church, it will be comparatively easy to determine the special service of each.<a name=367:8></a>

		"Meat in due season" is necessary for growth.<a name=367:9></a> "As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby"; and discipline in its full scope is necessary to check the budding or activities of the flesh.<a name=367:10></a> The one is to promote the advancement of the newborn babe, the other to remove the leaven or the snare which interferes with and hinders progress.<a name=367:11></a> To the servant who cares for the church it is simple and easy, if led of the Lord, to feed the saints with "food convenient" for them.<a name=367:12></a> As he is in communion he is sure to be instructed; "out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water"; that is, the Lord's mind, and the truth suited to their state, will be supplied to him from the word, often from the same chapter.<a name=367:13></a> He will be led to dwell on one part at one time, and on another part at another time, according to the need of souls.<a name=367:14></a> The Spirit leads him to supply through the word the particular instruction which the Lord would impart.<a name=367:15></a> Now, though everyone is not a teacher, everyone, as he is walking in communion in word

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It only remains now to add a word on discipline.<a name=368:3></a> The aim of all discipline is the welfare of the church, while at the same time it seeks to effect the welfare of the offender.<a name=368:4></a> If I care for the church, I must seek to purge out all leaven.<a name=368:5></a> So long as the Lord retains His place in an assembly, my duty is to urge on the assembly to look for His help to put away the one who leavens, when there is no possibility of eradicating it.<a name=368:6></a> When the Lord has been displaced in an assembly, which is generally when evil doctrine (or gangrene) has been taught and countenanced, then there is no option but to purge oneself from the vessels to dishonour.<a name=368:7></a> The necessity for this indicates the disordered state of the house, but also declares the ability of every believer to preserve a space in it suited to God in His dwelling-place; and such a company is ever, thank God, to be found.<a name=368:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So far I have dwelt on what is generally called church discipline, where we can see the principle of it in the clearest way.<a name=368:9></a> But besides this, it is incumbent on every saint to exercise discipline towards his fellows with whom he associates.<a name=368:10></a> There are some so bad that he is to "turn away" from them; "do not receive him into the house, and greet him not".<a name=368:11></a> There are others whom he must not receive socially; "have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.<a name=368:12></a> Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother".<a name=368:13></a> Then, finally, each one is responsible to "wash one another's feet"; that is, that in love I am charged to remove from my brother the soil on his conscience which interrupts his communion with the Lord, a most blessed service and an endless one.<a name=368:14></a>

		TRUTH AND ITS EFFECTS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Every truth has its own proper effect.<a name=369:4></a> Our blessed Lord was "the truth"; the fruit of it was fully seen in Him.<a name=369:5></a> As we receive the truth we are sanctified; we are set free from what we are naturally, and introduced into an entirely new order of being.<a name=369:6></a> It is therefore very interesting to note the separate and distinct effects produced, according to the measure or the nature of the truth apprehended in faith.<a name=369:7></a> Each truth has its own effect, and no truth would produce the effect of another truth.<a name=369:8></a> There is no confusion.<a name=369:9></a> If the desired effect is not possessed, the truth that would produce it is not apprehended in faith.<a name=369:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is very evident that the truth of the death and resurrection of Christ, laid hold of by faith, could alone produce peace.<a name=369:11></a> But then, consequent on justification, I have to reach deliverance; that is, that I am free in the life of Christ from the law of sin and death.<a name=369:12></a> I am not only cleared from all guilt, but alive in the One who cleared me, because not only did He die for my sins, but "God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, .<a name=369:13></a>.<a name=369:14></a>.<a name=369:15></a> condemned sin in the flesh".<a name=369:16></a> I do not reach to the proper effect of justification until I have deliverance.<a name=369:17></a> Any one can notice that if justification be known, and yet deliverance -- the practical experience that I am free from the law of sin and death -- be not reached, the believer, in so far as he is conscientious, is occupied with his own state, and does not come up to the proper effect of justification.<a name=369:18></a>

		The proper effect of one dead to sin and alive to God in Jesus Christ is the absolute surrender of the body to the Lord.<a name=370:1></a> It may be objected that many are very clear about the efficacy of the work of Christ, who do not present their bodies a living sacrifice.<a name=370:2></a> True, but if the proper effect of the truth has not been produced, it is plain that it is not the truth that is at fault, but the way it has been received.<a name=370:3></a> It is impossible that one should be clear from all sins by the blood of Christ, and free from the law of sin and death in the life of Him in whose death God condemned sin in the flesh, and not feel that truly the only reasonable service is that the body should be a living sacrifice to the Lord.<a name=370:4></a> The effect of a truth always defines the measure of it that one has apprehended in faith.<a name=370:5></a> One might scan the whole range of revealed truth, but the exact measure of it that has been received in faith will be defined by the effect that it has produced.<a name=370:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence, when there is any limitation of the grace that justifies us and sets us up free in the life of Him through whom we are justified, there must necessarily always be a corresponding lack in self-surrender to the Lord.<a name=370:7></a> We too often expect to find souls clear as to a truth, though in practice we see that they are far from it; and we arc often too much occupied with their acceptance of the truth verbally, instead of judging by its effect on them how far the acceptance is in faith.<a name=370:8></a> It is quite true that if there is defect in the knowledge of a truth, there must be a defect in its effect; though it is better, and conduces more to prosperity, when the effect of truth is in a measure beyond one's knowledge of it.<a name=370:9></a>

		WHY ARE THERE STRIFES?
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Differences amongst christians exist to such a lamentable extent that every true-hearted one would gladly hail any attempt to account for their existence.<a name=374:1></a> It is plain that if all were walking in the Spirit we should be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.<a name=374:2></a> It is not necessary for agreement about any given thing that each should look at the same side of it.<a name=374:3></a> For example, one might dwell on the beauty of a bird's feathers, another on its song, another on its power of flight, while another might confine his attention to its usefulness; but each, in a varied way, is occupied with the one object, and co-operating to a common end.<a name=374:4></a> Each star in the sky has its own distinct light and mission, and yet there is no clashing with one another -- all work together for a common object.<a name=374:5></a> Christ and the church might engage many, and though there would be a variety of apprehensions, there would not necessarily be strife, if the one object were common to them all.<a name=374:6></a> Each of the apostles wrote on subjects diverse from the others, and yet they were in perfect concord.<a name=374:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If, then, a common object ensures a common interest, how is it that there is not concord between christians who have Christ and the church as their object?<a name=374:8></a> If they have one common interest, we might conclude that there would be no discord.<a name=374:9></a> But we do not find it so.<a name=374:10></a> Many have Christ as the one common interest who are not agreed, but who, on the contrary, disagree much as to the way and mode in which this interest is to be expressed.<a name=374:11></a> This was the case with Martha and Mary.<a name=374:12></a> They had one common interest; but one sought to please the Lord according to her natural mind, while the other waited on Him for the unfolding of His own mind; and this was really the "good part" which should not be taken away.<a name=374:13></a> Hence it is evident that there is something more required than a common object of interest, even though it is the

		<a name=375>[Page 375]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		greatest.<a name=375:1></a> There cannot be a common interest without a common object; but when, as in the christian, there are really two powers in deadly opposition to each other, it is necessary for agreement that each should co-operate in the same power; that is, in the Spirit, and not in the flesh.<a name=375:2></a> The real cause of the disagreement between the two sisters was, that one was occupied with the Lord in man's way, and the other was learning from the Lord His way.<a name=375:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this is the great cause of all the differences amongst us.<a name=375:4></a> There is far more real love to Christ amongst christians than is generally allowed by one denomination to another; but the strife is often bitterest where there is most zeal.<a name=375:5></a> When the flesh is countenanced, and its means adopted, there must be direct collision with every one walking in the Spirit of God, for the more the aim of each is the Lord, the more openly must the contrariety in their modes of action appear; and thus they are manifestly distanced.<a name=375:6></a> The purpose is right in a multitude of cases, but the way the purpose is carried out discloses whether one is carnal or spiritual.<a name=375:7></a> "The flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other".<a name=375:8></a> There must be strife when flesh and Spirit come in contact.<a name=375:9></a> All the mistakes of the disciples, while personally attached to the Lord, arose from this.<a name=375:10></a> He was their Object, but they, regarding Him with their natural mind, misapprehended everything.<a name=375:11></a> Thus Peter proposed to build three tabernacles on the mount of transfiguration, and at another time rebuked the Lord for speaking of His death, which drew from Him the severe censure, "Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men".<a name=375:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in this lies the root of our strife in general; that is, man's feeling or judgment sways, and not the Spirit of God.<a name=375:13></a> Every one walking conscientiously can see how easily he can slip into his own judgment or feeling with

		regard to the Lord, and thus be at the very antipodes of the spiritual mind with reference to the matter in hand; and as a rule, the natural counsel has many more approvers than the spiritual, because it addresses the natural mind, which in its judgment always makes man prominent; and hence every natural mind in the audience is in sympathy with it.<a name=376:1></a> "The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God"; on the other hand, the Spirit of God considers absolutely for God.<a name=376:2></a> The collision, in every case, is really between God and man.<a name=376:3></a> Is it for man you are considering, or for God?<a name=376:4></a> From what arose all the distress and exercise of heart to the psalmist, in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#73">Psalm  73</a>, but that he had made himself paramount in his review of all that was passing around him; for when he was in the sanctuary, where God was paramount, everything appeared quite differently?<a name=376:5></a> The greatest contrariety existed between the psalmist when he was outside the sanctuary, and when he was inside.<a name=376:6></a> There was not one single point of agreement between the two.<a name=376:7></a>

		Constantly we find in Scripture that when two or more of the people of God are engaged in any service, the man of faith, the man resting on God, is hindered in his service, and strife ensues, because his companion, or companions, seek to serve according to their own thoughts.<a name=377:2></a> Thus the greatest strife may ensue between the closest friends.<a name=377:3></a> Abraham suffered most from Lot.<a name=377:4></a> Lot followed his natural tastes, and, doubtless at the time, encouraged himself with the feeling that he was more prosperous than Abraham.<a name=377:5></a> See the unhappy collision of Aaron and Miriam with Moses; the two former seemed, to all natural sense, contending for what was right and proper; but, alas!<a name=377:6></a> envy was at the bottom of it, and it was really with the intent of exalting themselves that they cast this reproach on their own brother, and God's most honoured servant.<a name=377:7></a> David was sore distressed by the sons of Zeruiah.<a name=377:8></a> In like manner there is strife between Paul and Barnabas, two men who had long worked together in the Lord's service in the most blessed way.<a name=377:9></a> And why?<a name=377:10></a> Because Barnabas considered for his kinsman, and Paul for the Lord only.<a name=377:11></a> Barnabas evidently did not think that the Jewish tendencies of Mark were of so grave a nature that he was thereby disqualified from being a companion with him in the Lord's service, while Paul, who considered simply for the Lord and the good of His people, distinctly refused to accept his company or cooperation; and it seems, from the reference made to him in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#4">Colossians  4</a>, that there had been orders about him, which were not to be enforced at the time the apostle wrote.<a name=377:12></a> Surely, the more we investigate, the better we shall see that the cause of strife generally between any two christians is that one has allowed human consideration of some kind to sway him, while the other, with a more single eye, considers for the Lord only.<a name=377:13></a> I do not deny that a great deal of mixed motives intrudes, and the best of purposes may be grievously damaged by

		There would be no cause of strife if we all were so simply devoted to the Lord that our bodies were a living sacrifice, not conformed to this world, but transformed by the renewal of our minds, that we may be able to prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.<a name=378:3></a> The more positively abstracted we are from all here, and all that influences us here, and in association with the Lord, the more we are qualified, like Moses coming from the mount, to judge of what is going on here, and to judge of it as God judges of it.<a name=378:4></a> And as then Moses was at issue with Aaron, so it is now.<a name=378:5></a> The more any one is imbued with God's things at the moment, the more is he at issue with his closest companion in the Lord, who is literally in the midst of the things here, and thus more or less affected by them.<a name=378:6></a>

		THE MEASURE OF GRACE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Grace is the first ray of comfort to the soul; and though it is the subject first known and most cherished, yet the measure of it, according to God's revelation of it, is little known.<a name=379:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Grace, according to popular teaching, is the undeserved favour of God in saving everyone who believes in Christ.<a name=379:4></a> The soul's need defines the measure of the grace.<a name=379:5></a> Surely, were the grace of God no more than this, it would be marvellously blessed.<a name=379:6></a> But it is much more.<a name=379:7></a> If the grace were no more than my need required, though it would be sufficient, blessed by God, to rescue me from everlasting misery, it would not, while it saved me from all the consequences of my sins, ever have placed me in nearness to God.<a name=379:8></a> Having sinned, I could not restore myself to the position of innocence that Adam held.<a name=379:9></a> I could be a forgiven sinner, forgiven up to the last moment of my life here, and thus happy in heaven.<a name=379:10></a> Escape from judgment, and an assurance of everlasting happiness, is for the most part the idea which the word grace conveys to many christians.<a name=379:11></a> If grace did not secure to me justification and everlasting happiness, it would not meet my need.<a name=379:12></a> Surely God intimated in the garden of Eden, when He clothed Adam and Eve with coats of skins, that in grace He would not only clear them of their sins, but that He would clothe them afresh by His own hand, that they should not be found naked.<a name=379:13></a> He thus set forth that there should be something more than forgiveness -- escape from a lost state; that in His grace there would be in their future position a great advance beyond that which they had lost by transgression.<a name=379:14></a> This intimated the measure of the grace.<a name=379:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Abram was counted righteous; that is, the grace was equal to the need.<a name=380:3></a> He believed God who quickens the dead.<a name=380:4></a> There was no hope from man as he was, but God in His grace could come in and do what was entirely outside of man.<a name=380:5></a> "And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb: he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God; and being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#4:19">Romans  4:19</a> - 21.<a name=380:6></a> Thus there was a clearance of all guilt.<a name=380:7></a>

		Now, in the case of Isaiah, in chapter 6 we find too that the grace is equal to the need.<a name=380:8></a> His iniquity is taken away, and his sin is purged; but this is in connection with a live coal from the altar, which indicated that the grace could only be on the ground of the action of fire in its sacrificial aspect.<a name=380:9></a> In none of these cases do we see that the sinner obtains more than a full clearance from his guilt.<a name=380:10></a> However, in the offerings in the book of Leviticus a very important truth is presented to us, namely, how the sinner can come near to God.<a name=380:11></a> It is, I might say, the other side now.<a name=380:12></a> The offerings properly are for those who keep the law.<a name=380:13></a> Breaches of the ceremonial law are to be atoned for, and all uncleanness, but the main intention of the offerings was to indicate the place of nearness in which grace sets the believer.<a name=380:14></a> There is much more contemplated than simply clearance.<a name=380:15></a> There was a sense of acceptance, and consequently worship within, in the holy place, for Aaron and his sons, typically the church; and without, Israel, the earthly

		From this review we gather that the blessed God did not intend to limit His grace to our need, that is, to our sins, but that He had in His heart the purpose to superabound in grace.<a name=381:2></a> So not only was debt atoned for, but the grace which covered it was of surpassing riches; so that not only was the man who owed five hundred pence forgiven, but at the moment he was forgiven he received immensely more; "where sin abounded, grace did much more abound".<a name=381:3></a> It is like the four lepers in the siege of Samaria; they not only ate and drank, not only was the famine entirely over, but "they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and came again, and entered into another tent, and carried thence also, and went and hid it"; and from the greatest dearth they were greatly enriched.<a name=381:4></a> There is not only forgiveness of sins, but "inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me".<a name=381:5></a>

		There is great natural reluctance in the heart to reach up to any true sense of the greatness of the grace which has come to us, though our need makes us appreciate the measure of it that meets the need.<a name=381:6></a> Hence what meets the need is always presented to the sinner first, though in the mind of God there is no break in its blessed, endless stream.<a name=381:7></a> A woman who has spent all her living on physicians and is nothing bettered knows well the blessedness of grace, when in faith she touches the hem of His garment.<a name=381:8></a> Beautiful to a degree was her faith, and she finds the grace is equal to her need; she is well, but she did not want to add to it, nor to learn the extent of the stream of blessing which had healed her.<a name=381:9></a> When she comes to Christ, she falls down before Him and tells Him all the truth; now she finds that the grace which cured her is very much greater; she learns the One who is the fountain of grace, her soul is affiliated to the

		There was declension at Corinth, though they were so greatly gifted.<a name=393:20></a> They reigned as kings; led away by self-indulgence, they were loose in their own lives, and therefore were so in the church.<a name=393:21></a> They were not led of the Spirit.<a name=393:22></a> They did not remember that "he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit".<a name=393:23></a>

		to be made perfect in the flesh.<a name=394:1></a> There was declension at Thessalonica, when an event, even the greatest event, engrossed their hearts more than Christ.<a name=394:2></a> There was declension at Ephesus, when they left their first love.<a name=394:3></a> There was declension in Asia, when it could be said, "All who are in Asia .<a name=394:4></a>.<a name=394:5></a>.<a name=394:6></a> have turned away from me".<a name=394:7></a> Declension marked the Hebrews, when in their hearts they turned back to earth, instead of running on to heaven.<a name=394:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we have glanced at the many phases of declension as recounted in Scripture.<a name=394:9></a> I will now seek to define the more general forms in which it occurs, and, at the same time, point out how walking in the Spirit, which is power, would have preserved us.<a name=394:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The most common form of declension is when, after having taken a right step, we are tempted and drawn away by an offer ministering to our natural taste.<a name=394:11></a> Thus it was when the green fields turned away Lot, and when the water so engrossed the nine thousand seven hundred of Gideon's brave followers, that they were suddenly disbanded and unemployed; ready and willing to serve, but disqualified -- the case with many in this day.<a name=394:12></a> Thus, Mark, when at Pamphylia, returned to his house at Jerusalem.<a name=394:13></a> This is so common that no one is safe from it.<a name=394:14></a> In fact, there is sure to be a temptation presented to us after every advance, and the only preservative is to <i>continue</i>: "Whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing".<a name=394:15></a> The insidious feature in this declension is that there is no apparent surrender of any position.<a name=394:16></a> Where there is power, there is the refusal of everything which would divert us from our good beginning.<a name=394:17></a> Indeed, the way to help one in this state is simply to recall them to their beginning.<a name=394:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Secondly, there is declension when one who has, through grace and much exercise, been led to the right ground, and has been blessed there, is overpowered by human influences, while retaining, as he thinks, the right ground and the truth -- like Barnabas taking his kinsman, and going to Cyprus, or Jacob at Shalem; and all

	<div class="paragraph">
		because a worldly sentiment was indulged in.<a name=395:1></a> This is a very painful declension, because one is like Ephraim; "Gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not".<a name=395:2></a> There is no easy recovery from this, because one is deceived, unless one feels the pressure of the world one has fallen into; and then God restores, as He did Barnabas and Jacob.<a name=395:3></a> In both it was an unjudged worldliness which led to their fall.<a name=395:4></a> Had they walked on straight, as called of God, they would have been preserved.<a name=395:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another class, while admitting the beauty and excellence of heavenly things, are really discouraged themselves from going up to possess them, because they have no faith, and discourage others.<a name=395:6></a> This shows the danger of sentimentalising on truth.<a name=395:7></a> It is here, no doubt, that Demas was, and all that are in Asia, who turned away from Paul.<a name=395:8></a> The knowledge of truth in itself is not power, as we see at Corinth, and with the two disciples going to Emmaus, and very markedly with the ten spies.<a name=395:9></a> They commended the land, but discouraged the people.<a name=395:10></a> They had not faith for themselves, and therefore they would taint others, as they were tainted themselves.<a name=395:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again; often, when there is true devotedness with an unbroken will, there is a great deal of energy in preaching or doing.<a name=395:12></a> It is painful to see, at times, with much devotedness, really no spirituality; like Martha, cumbered about much serving, or the disciples going a-fishing.<a name=395:13></a> This declension is very specious, because many, as well as the person himself, regard such a course as very useful.<a name=395:14></a> It is the occupation with the usefulness which feeds the declension.<a name=395:15></a> Generally, those under this form are buoyed up with their own sense of what they had done; ready to say, "We have left all, and have followed thee".<a name=395:16></a> When power works here, they are occupied with their gain in Christ, and not with their service, or their surrender for Him.<a name=395:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One more case.<a name=395:18></a> A declension of a very covert character, and one not easily corrected, is when one contends and

		suffers for the right position -- the heavenly position -- and while, like the two and a half tribes, he endures in battle to secure the position, he never tastes or knows the good of it, nor is he marked by the power of it.<a name=396:1></a> The position of a heavenly man, without the power, is delusive.<a name=396:2></a> It is the power that makes known the reality of the position.<a name=396:3></a> The two and a half tribes fought for the position in Canaan, but never enjoyed the land; their hearts were where their families and their cattle were.<a name=396:4></a> No one could, in faith, accept the position of a heavenly man, without being characterised by separation from this world, a real severance from all on this side Jordan.<a name=396:5></a> Perhaps in no way has the testimony suffered more than by insisting on heavenly position without practical self-denial.<a name=396:6></a> Worldly honours may be declined, while there is as much consideration for oneself in earthly things as if there were nothing greater.<a name=396:7></a>

		THE WORK OF CHRIST AND WHAT IT EFFECTS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In order to understand the effect of a work, we must first know the nature and scope of it.<a name=396:9></a> The great defect in believers is that, while they believe in Christ, they have a limited or incorrect idea of what He has done.<a name=396:10></a> When I know the measure of Christ's work, even though I may not be in the full enjoyment of all He has wrought out for me, I at least know what is mine, and I could not accept anything else.<a name=396:11></a> It will be found that in christendom the variety of sects arises from their varied limitations of the work of Christ.<a name=396:12></a> Christ's work can be determined only by what He was sent to do.<a name=396:13></a> He can say in anticipation, in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>, "I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do".<a name=396:14></a> In like manner at the beginning of His

	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing, and the thing of the deepest interest to us, is to ascertain what was the work which was given Him to do, and which He has done.<a name=397:2></a> When we go back to the fall, we are told that the seed of the woman should bruise the serpent's head.<a name=397:3></a> Here we get a very definite and comprehensive view of Christ's work.<a name=397:4></a> The power of the enemy is to be broken by Him; He is to "destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage".<a name=397:5></a> The full effect of His work in this respect is not yet manifested.<a name=397:6></a> Satan still rages.<a name=397:7></a> The time has not yet come when He will bruise Satan under our feet, but Satan was vanquished in the death of Christ, so that we can say, "O death, where is thy sting?<a name=397:8></a> O grave, where is thy victory?<a name=397:9></a> .<a name=397:10></a>.<a name=397:11></a>.<a name=397:12></a> Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ".<a name=397:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The important thing for faith to apprehend is what Christ has done.<a name=397:14></a> He has abolished death and brought life and incorruptibility to light by the gospel.<a name=397:15></a> We are not to measure Christ's work by our apprehension of it.<a name=397:16></a> True, there is no sense of its value but as we apprehend it in faith, yet it is of deep moment that we should have before our hearts the measure to be apprehended.<a name=397:17></a> It is clear to every exercised soul how little one walks here in the simple assurance that Satan's power has been broken by Christ, that He has done this work.<a name=397:18></a> We practically realise it as we resist the devil; as it has been said, resist the devil, and when he finds Christ in you, he will flee from you.<a name=397:19></a> Now if we are feeble in our faith as to the subjugation of the power of the devil by Christ in His death, it will be found that we are still more so in our faith as to the place with God which His work has obtained for us: that it is according to His glory; that is, every attribute of His nature is maintained, His righteousness

		When we read that "by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified", what an immense scope and measure is presented to our minds!<a name=398:2></a> All that was typified by all the offerings is fulfilled in divine perfection.<a name=398:3></a> In His one offering we are brought, according to God's holiness, not only <i>from</i> the greatest distance, but <i>to</i> the greatest nearness; we are entitled to be in the Holiest of all by the work of Christ.<a name=398:4></a> It is of all importance that we see that the work which sheltered us from the judgment of God, the worst and most distant place, is the same which has given us title to enter the brightest and the best place.<a name=398:5></a> If His work has done the one, so has His work, and His work only, obtained for us the other.<a name=398:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in His one offering there was the burnt-offering, the meat-offering, and the peace-offering, as well as the sin-offering.<a name=398:7></a> The latter gave the blessed God liberty to have us in the Holiest, and through it we are entitled to enter; but besides, in His presence we have fellowship with Him in His satisfaction in Christ as the Man who glorified Him on earth in death and in life, and who is ever the prosperity-offering for every believer.<a name=398:8></a> It is most important to see that it is the finish of Christ's work which alone can declare the full effect of it.<a name=398:9></a> True, in my soul I may not have reached the finish, but surely if I have not the finish of it before me as He finished it, I have accepted a lower measure than what He has done, and here, though unintentionally, I dishonour Him and suffer loss myself.<a name=398:10></a> In all ordinary things the value is unknown until the execution is completed.<a name=398:11></a>

		Now not only is nearness to God, as the Holiest typifies, secured for us by the work of Christ, but also His place is our place.<a name=399:11></a> Surely it is not enough to hold that the work of Christ effects a clearance of all guilt; that is only a part of the great whole.<a name=399:12></a> The work of Christ is described, "the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God"; not only great as it would be -- to save us from judgment, but to bring us to God.<a name=399:13></a> We have seen that by one offering Christ has effected, according to His own infinite perfection, all that was shadowed forth in types.<a name=399:14></a> Thus our approach to God by His work can only be measured by Himself; nay, the very glory resting on Him, as the One who has established everything

		There are four aspects of His death, and it is thus in parts that we apprehend it.<a name=400:8></a> We learn first how His blood shelters us from judgment.<a name=400:9></a> Then, when we believe in the death and resurrection of Christ, we are not only clear of all our guilt, but we are really as the type sets forth, brought to God; we can sing, "Thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation".<a name=400:10></a> Practically, according to the type, we are not in Canaan yet; we have to learn experimentally the death in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21">Numbers  21</a>.<a name=400:11></a> The Son of man is lifted up, and He is now our life; "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death".<a name=400:12></a> Now, in the liberty of His life, I am not only dead to sin, but I also learn that having died with Him, I am dead to the world.<a name=400:13></a> I am across Jordan; I am in heaven.<a name=400:14></a> We are often a long time reaching up to this, the full effect of His work; and yet it is the same work which sheltered us from judgment which lands us in heaven.<a name=400:15></a> This is exemplified in the thief on the cross.<a name=400:16></a> In one step he is transferred from the deepest degradation and distance to the greatest elevation, and there with Christ -- the most honoured position.<a name=400:17></a> The same work brought him from one place, the lowest and the worst, to the highest and the best.<a name=400:18></a> The man who would limit Christ's work to the first part, and leave out the other, would not only deprive

	<div class="paragraph">
		In 2 Timothy we are given the varied influences which hinder and mar the truth.<a name=402:3></a> The first is, that "all who are in Asia .<a name=402:4></a>.<a name=402:5></a>.<a name=402:6></a> have turned away from" Paul.<a name=402:7></a> The fact that those among whom the apostle had laboured chiefly should turn away from him necessarily had a very injurious effect on souls.<a name=402:8></a> Those who had not known him, and who had heard of his teaching, must have been shaken in their minds as to the validity of it, when those who had heard him first and most turned away from him.<a name=402:9></a> If I turn away from a teacher when I have only first heard him, it may be alleged that I have not understood him; but when those who had known him well turned away from him, after having received from him the deepest truth, they must have been perverted by direct Satanic agency.<a name=402:10></a>

		It is a different thing to be slow or unwilling to receive a truth, and to renounce and abandon it after having received it.<a name=402:11></a> In the one case I have not as yet felt in my conscience the divine verity of it; in the other, after having received it as the truth of God, I have deliberately abandoned it.<a name=402:12></a> There cannot be any growth until this retrogression has been confessed and relinquished; whereas, if I have never received it, there is still hope that the word may be effectual.<a name=402:13></a> The former case is of the character of the sow that was washed, and hence it is "better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them".<a name=402:14></a> A truth may be refused without a surrender of conscience, but when truth once accepted has been given up, then the conscience has been corrupted and over-ridden.<a name=402:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus the era of retrogression began; and surely there is no one who has carefully taken note of the opposition to the truth in our time, but must have seen how one of the most significant marks of the enemy's power is the shameless way in which some have turned away from the truth which they had once accepted, as well as from the teacher they once revered as God's messenger of it.<a name=404:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now while this deep dark foe was preying on the consciences of the saints, secretly abstracting from them the very eyesight of the soul, there were also in the assembly openly "profane and vain babblings" which would "increase unto more ungodliness"; so much so that two well known men maintained that the resurrection had taken place already; that is, there was an open denial of fundamental truth.<a name=404:3></a> When the assembly became so demoralised as to suffer such an intrusion, it was very evident that the Lord's presence was not there, that the saints were not in faith gathered to His name.<a name=404:4></a> If there had been even two or three of them thus gathered, such a grievous intrusion would have been resisted.<a name=404:5></a> And if the conscience of the assembly, not merely the conscience of a few, were not aroused to the enormity of their course, there was then no option left but to separate from these vessels to dishonour.<a name=404:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first instance we have the abandonment of the teacher sent of God, and once accepted as such.<a name=404:7></a> Next we have in the assembly the unblushing advocacy of a teaching which undermines christianity, "saying that the resurrection has taken place already".<a name=404:8></a> Many in christendom are leavened with this doctrine, who would not avow it.<a name=404:9></a> Surely the godless way in which christians, Corinthian-like, seek pleasure as if their bodies were not the Lord's, is a practical denial of the resurrection of the body; it is the principle of, "Let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:32">1 Corinthians  15:32</a>.<a name=404:10></a> Is it to be wondered

		at that concurrently with or consequent upon an avowed abandonment of the apostle, the servant of God, to whom specially the truth of "the mystery of the gospel" was committed, the next inroad of the enemy would be to introduce false doctrine into the assembly?<a name=405:1></a> When this evil was permitted in the house of God it was defiled, and the only course open to the faithful was simply to separate from the vessels to dishonour, and to identify themselves with "those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart".<a name=405:2></a> Thus as a true remnant they would maintain the truth which had been relinquished, and they, gathered to the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, would still enjoy His presence here, and be as God's house, where He could make known His pleasure.<a name=405:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence the action of divine power is greater in restoring than in introducing.<a name=405:4></a> In the latter a space is necessary, but in the other all the influences which together had dismantled and almost destroyed the assembly -- God's house -- are overcome, and it comes forth, as it were, from the dead in spite of them.<a name=405:5></a> Satan seemed to succeed when everything was at its prime; but God sets Satan at nought when, through even a handful, He restores the testimony; and then, too, there is a greater manifestation of His power <i>for</i> us, though not by us.<a name=405:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have considered the nature of the opposition to the truth when failure set in.<a name=405:7></a> Now we have to dwell on the character of it in "difficult times".<a name=405:8></a> The opposition in these times is twofold; one when the truth is withstood by an exhibition of power, and the other, when their ears are turned away from the truth, and are turned to fables.<a name=405:9></a> The first is more with reference to the teachers; the second, to the congregation at large.<a name=405:10></a>

		It is almost inscrutable how one professing to be a christian could attempt to withstand the truth like Jannes and Jambres.<a name=405:11></a> We must remember that these withstood Moses by claiming to do the same works that Moses did by "the finger of God".<a name=405:12></a> They would neutralise that which was of God, by showing that they, by

		calling in our life: Naturally one would have supposed that the course to be adopted in order to expose an imitation would be by instituting a comparison between the real and the spurious; but that is not the way enjoined here.<a name=407:1></a> It is by insisting on the greatness of the positive truth as practically exhibited.<a name=407:2></a> "Thou hast fully known my doctrine", and, "Continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them".<a name=407:3></a> The more fully I am acquainted with the Scriptures, the more I am formed and swayed by them; as one has said, 'I not only get thoughts from Scripture, but Scripture forms my thoughts; and thus in a very blessed way I am kept from man's ways and devisings, and adhere simply and truly to God's ways and manner of acting'.<a name=407:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When one is not proof to this part of the opposition, the second is sure to prevail, namely, such as is described in <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#4:3">2 Timothy  4:3</a>, 4.<a name=407:5></a> "For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; and they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables".<a name=407:6></a> It is not now trying to neutralise the truth by seeking to produce an action similar to what God's power produces; and it is not only the deliberate turning away their ears from the truth, but there is the turning of them to fables, myths, things that never had any existence, false creations of the mind by a power foreign to God; it is an entire surrender of the truth for myths.<a name=407:7></a> But the servant of God must not yield: "Watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry".<a name=407:8></a> And the apostle himself is the example of the solitary unit suffering for the truth of God; an encouragement to us, that if through faithfulness to Christ we are reduced to the same isolation, we shall find the same consolation and succour from the Lord that he found.<a name=407:9></a> "Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that

		THE EFFECTS WHICH SPRING FROM UNION WITH CHRIST
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"We love him, because he first loved us".<a name=408:4></a> His love to us is the origin and spring of all our love to Him.<a name=408:5></a> Hence the better and more fully we know His love and can enter into it, the better we love Him.<a name=408:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are, I might say, three measures of our love to Him.<a name=408:7></a> The first, when we know what He has done for us as Saviour; second, when we know what He is doing for us as Priest; and thirdly, when we know union with Him as our Head.<a name=408:8></a> His love for each of us existed in the whole three before we knew the first; consequently it is only when we know the three that we truly know the love that led Him to do the first -- to die for us.<a name=408:9></a> He "loved me, and gave himself for me"; this embraces everything; He loved the church and gave himself for it; yet our love is always measured by the measure we know of His love.<a name=408:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When I know Him as my Saviour, as the One who bore the judgment for me, who was delivered for my offences and raised again for my justification, then the love of God is shed abroad in my heart by the Holy Spirit which is given to me.<a name=408:11></a> I begin to be without fear, for as His love is known fear departs.<a name=408:12></a> It is when we are relieved from the fear of judgment by His work that we have the first sense of love to Him.<a name=408:13></a> The freedom from fear, assured to our hearts by Himself as when He said to Peter, "Fear not", makes Him dearer to us than anything else; and as they brought their ships to land and followed Him, so does every one who has tasted this measure of His love.<a name=408:14></a> So with Jonathan; when he saw that by the hand of David Goliath, the terror of his soul, had been completely removed, his head in David's

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is very interesting to note the effect of this measure.<a name=409:5></a> The heart has learned that through a Man -- the Lord Jesus Christ -- it is relieved of all fear in the presence of God.<a name=409:6></a> Where the fear existed, there it had been removed, and the consequence is that the heart clings to this Person, and delights to surrender for His sake.<a name=409:7></a> The woman in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7">Luke  7</a>going into the Pharisee's house, a place she would naturally shrink from, in order to express her love to Jesus as her Saviour, sets forth in pattern one who has reached this measure.<a name=409:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We all know how striking and effective it is when we see one now and again so attracted to Him that there is an open and public surrender of property or natural advantages in order to make much of Him.<a name=409:9></a> The One from heaven is more to the heart than any property here.<a name=409:10></a> Love likes to exalt its object at its own loss.<a name=409:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next measure of His love made known to us is the way He is "able to sympathise with our infirmities".<a name=409:12></a> We grow in a deeper sense of the first measure as we advance in the knowledge of His love.<a name=409:13></a> It is like the growth of a tree, every advance in the tree increases the first growth, so that the bottom of the tree is ever the greatest part of it.<a name=409:14></a> In the first measure all the question of sin has been settled; and by the Spirit, in the freedom of His life, we are, though encompassed with infirmity, moving onward and upward.<a name=409:15></a> Then we learn that He never leaves us nor forsakes us, but as we are near Him, He sympathises with us, as He Himself has felt a similar trial or difficulty.<a name=409:16></a> He cannot sympathise with wilfulness; He does with infirmities.<a name=409:17></a> He took our infirmities on Him and bare our sicknesses.<a name=409:18></a> The One who perfectly knows us, perfectly loves us, and is perfectly able to feel with us; He, in divine power, is ever in the aspect suited to cheer and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mary of Bethany knew Him in this measure, she knew His sympathy; while Martha, who suffered from the same sorrow, was too unsubdued to know it.<a name=410:4></a> The knowledge of this measure is very effective.<a name=410:5></a> It is not so much the thought of giving to Him in any open way, as with Jonathan, but now nothing can satisfy but His company; we cannot do without Him.<a name=410:6></a> The more we use Him in our daily difficulties, and learn how He would act in them, -- and thus His own grace is imparted to us, -- the less can we bear to be here without Him.<a name=410:7></a> The most valued thing belonging to this scene is freely buried with Him; and this is properly the difference between the alabaster box of <a href="../bible/John.htm#12">John  12</a>and <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7">Luke  7</a>.<a name=410:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a most wonderful history.<a name=410:9></a> How happy to remember all the way that He has led us!<a name=410:10></a> Surely if Elisha could feel that Elijah was so indispensable to him that nothing but a double portion of his spirit could make up for his absence, how much more with us who know anything of the company of our blessed Lord, so infinitely beyond that of Elijah!<a name=410:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One is now like Ruth to Naomi.<a name=410:12></a> A Person commands our whole being.<a name=410:13></a> It is not now surrender of property in testimony of my heart's affection, but it is that a Person is more to me than anything here, and that I can readily leave everything I have known and valued, as Rebekah did for Isaac.<a name=410:14></a> The One who is my only stay and comfort on this earth has left it; hence I am running on to heaven, for "he that shall come will come, and will not tarry".<a name=410:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we come to the third measure of His love in which every measure is fully learned.<a name=410:16></a> In this measure we know the exceeding greatness of the power that wrought in Christ: we know that we are united to Him by the

		Holy Spirit.<a name=411:1></a> The One whom we know as our Saviour and High Priest is our Head, "from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God".<a name=411:2></a> It is from this altitude that we can acquire some apprehension of His love "which passeth knowledge".<a name=411:3></a> For it is when we know our calling that, as in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:11">Ephesians  3:11</a> - 20, we know the love that passes knowledge, that we might be "filled even to all the fulness of God".<a name=411:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The knowledge of union, which is the consummation of love, has an effect on us entirely different from any previous measure of His love.<a name=411:5></a> True it is that then the greatness of His love in giving Himself is fully known, and hence, as I have said, His giving Himself to death is ever the sure ground for His doing anything.<a name=411:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now let us try to gather from Scripture some of the effects which spring from the knowledge of union with Christ.<a name=411:7></a> I believe the first great effect is restfulness of heart.<a name=411:8></a> Surely as united to Him I know that as He is, so am I in this world.<a name=411:9></a> See the effect on Mary Magdalene as a pattern, when she heard His words, "I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God".<a name=411:10></a> The everlasting bond of union is the climax of affection.<a name=411:11></a> There cannot be more, and there never can be less.<a name=411:12></a> The heart rests in an indissoluble tie to its object.<a name=411:13></a> It cannot be made surer of what it loves.<a name=411:14></a> When the heart has not learned this, it is ever to a great degree occupied with itself -- with relation, I admit, to the Lord, but then there is not complete restfulness; hence I believe this is its first effect.<a name=411:15></a> Stephen knew it in power when he, through the Holy Spirit, "looked up steadfastly into heaven".<a name=411:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, restfulness being the first effect, the next is that I am in spirit where He is; His place is my place, an enjoyment and reality which I could not know here if I were not united to Him.<a name=411:17></a> My joy is full.<a name=411:18></a> An immense field of blessing is now opened out to me, which is embodied in the prayer in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:14">Ephesians  3:14</a> - 21.<a name=411:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=412>[Page 412]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next, as down here, I am devoted to His pleasure; I know in whom I have believed, and, like the disciples, though I am where He is not, His words are now the one thought of my heart.<a name=412:1></a> "If a man love me, he will keep my words".<a name=412:2></a> It is evident one is now in quite a new line.<a name=412:3></a> It has been said that a relationship generates its own affections, hence there is now an entirely new experience to the heart.<a name=412:4></a> As one Spirit with the Lord, I feel I am entirely under His control.<a name=412:5></a> The church is subject to Christ.<a name=412:6></a> I have now but One to please.<a name=412:7></a> It is both my duty and my joy.<a name=412:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If the entirely new position in which I am set through union with Christ be not seen, I shall not be able to understand the drawing of heart to Him which springs from that relationship.<a name=412:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Obedience is ever connected with dependence.<a name=412:10></a> Next to obedience, or keeping His words, I get the sense of His confidence in me.<a name=412:11></a> My heart looks for His confidence.<a name=412:12></a> "I call you not servants .<a name=412:13></a>.<a name=412:14></a>.<a name=412:15></a> but I have called you friends".<a name=412:16></a> "The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her".<a name=412:17></a> There is no greater confirmation of His unhindered love than that He confides in us, no greater joy to my heart; as He said to Peter, "Feed my lambs", "Feed my sheep".<a name=412:18></a> He failed because of confidence in himself, but the Lord would have confidence in him.<a name=412:19></a> What joy to my heart when this is known!<a name=412:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are next in concert with Him, an experience of untold blessedness when I can share with Him in His interests.<a name=412:21></a> If I am not enjoying union I could not be in company with Him in His present work, even to "sanctify" the church.<a name=412:22></a> This is His present chief interest, and the nearer I am to Him and the more subject I am to Him like Sarah, calling Him Lord the more He leads me into what His heart is set on.<a name=412:23></a> If the heart of the queen of Sheba was entranced when she saw all the personal interests of Solomon, how much more is mine, when the Holy Spirit glorifies Him to me; as He said, "He shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you".<a name=412:24></a> It is not easy

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The love that accepts my service binds my heart to itself, for when we serve from love, our love is always increased, as a mother's love for her child.<a name=413:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Service embraces the assembly and its prosperity; a great circle of interest, as the faithful wife devoted to the interests of her lord in his absence, beginning with "endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace", up to the highest point, "till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ", reaching out to every detail which would subserve to this great end; and finally, "strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might", resisting every force of the enemy to turn us aside from making known "the mystery of the gospel".<a name=413:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To the heart in true service, only one thing remains, and that is to see Him.<a name=413:5></a> The heart will be fully satisfied when we see Him .<a name=413:6></a> The one loving Him best, and serving Him best, the bride in character, has but one leading desire, even to see Him, and hence, in company with the Spirit, says to Him, "Come!<a name=413:7></a>" while still unwearied in service.<a name=413:8></a> Surely it is only the heart that lives on His love that can know the way love to Him is deepened and increased as the sense of His coming is a felt reality to it.<a name=413:9></a> Surely the wise virgins trimmed their lamps to go out to meet Him.<a name=413:10></a> The nearer He is, the more the heart longs to see Him.<a name=413:11></a> He promotes love in our hearts by leading us into the consciousness of His being near.<a name=413:12></a> Thus proximity to Him produces suitability; as with Rebekah, when she caught sight of Isaac, she became in appearance suited for him; "she took a vail, and covered herself".<a name=413:13></a>
