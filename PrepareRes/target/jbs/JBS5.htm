		THE PLACE WHERE CHRIST IS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#5:9">Joshua  5:9</a> - 11
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is of all importance that if we know the Lord is not here, we should know the <i>place</i> where He is.<a name=1:1></a> In fact, we could not be truly attached to Him where He is not if we did not follow Him in heart to the place where He is.<a name=1:2></a> The place is heaven, which is our only place.<a name=1:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The point for us to consider next is how we enter into and enjoy the place where He is.<a name=1:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The great failure of the church was giving up Paul.<a name=1:5></a> Therefore it was said to Timothy, "Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of <i>me his prisoner</i>".<a name=1:6></a> All in Asia did not give up evangelical truth, but they gave up Paul.<a name=1:7></a> Anything popular you may have, but not Paul; and why?<a name=1:8></a> Because it is <i>heavenly</i>.<a name=1:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If I look at men of God like Baxter, John Newton, Samuel Rutherford, Owen, or George Herbert, what do I find?<a name=1:10></a> Plenty of affection for Christ, but nothing heavenly.<a name=1:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I cannot believe you love the Person if you would not like to get to the <i>place</i> where He is.<a name=1:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I never saw a division yet in which the heavenly position was not given up by the malcontents.<a name=1:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is of immense importance that we seek to understand the <i>place</i>.<a name=1:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in the passage in Joshua it is not that they were not over Jordan.<a name=1:15></a> They <i>were</i> over Jordan, and it is in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:20">Colossians  2:20</a> that you are over Jordan.<a name=1:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Romans you get "dead to sin, dead with Christ": <i>out of the man</i>.<a name=1:17></a> But in Colossians you are out of the <i>place</i> where the man is.<a name=1:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When I get deliverance I am free from the <i>man</i>; the next step is, I am clear of the <i>place where he is</i>.<a name=1:19></a>

		Gilgal is the actual spot where all of man goes.<a name=2:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Many understand Marah who do not understand Gilgal.<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Marah is that I refuse the thing that would draw me from the wilderness.<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Gilgal you drop it all.<a name=2:4></a> It is <i>cut off</i> and cannot be resumed.<a name=2:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was said lately that the testimony is all about the Lord Jesus Christ; but I would add that the testimony is to a <i>glorified</i> Saviour.<a name=2:6></a> For in <a href="../bible/John.htm#15:26">John  15:26</a> the Lord says, "whom I will send".<a name=2:7></a> This is not the same as in chapter 14: 16: "I will pray the Father, and <i>he</i> shall give", etc.<a name=2:8></a> In one place the Holy Spirit is spoken of as sent by the <i>Father</i>, in the other as sent by the Lord; and there are two distinct offices connected with the mission of the Holy Spirit in these two chapters, in chapter 14 to comfort them, and in chapter 15 testimony.<a name=2:9></a> Power and faith are always connected.<a name=2:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What gives power is, as we have in <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#4">Jeremiah  4</a>, "Return unto me".<a name=2:11></a> "He shall testify of <i>me</i>", the blessed Person who is gone up to the right hand of God.<a name=2:12></a> His body is on the earth, and that body was to be the expression or manifestation of that Man in the very scene of His rejection.<a name=2:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You do not get "testify" in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>, but in <a href="../bible/John.htm#16">John  16</a>, "He shall glorify me, <i>for</i> he shall receive of <i>mine</i> and shall show it unto you".<a name=2:14></a> The effect will be as with the queen of Sheba; she said, as it were, I have lost Abyssinia, but I have gained the knowledge of all the glory of Solomon; "The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16:6">Psalm  16:6</a>.<a name=2:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You can be occupied with feelings of attachment for a person, and yet not be in concert with what that person has, because you are not in the place.<a name=2:16></a> <i>That</i> is "the old corn of the land".<a name=2:17></a> The children of Israel when they got over Jordan had the passover, and the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		day after they ate the old corn of the land.<a name=3:1></a> The passover was a type of the Lord's supper, in which I can say, I have reached the consummation of His accomplished work.<a name=3:2></a> I begin a new day, and I eat of the old corn of the land.<a name=3:3></a> When I come to Gilgal I find I am left in a place where the Lord is not, but I have the power of the Holy Spirit in the place where the Lord is not.<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What has hindered souls from understanding the mystery is that they are not consciously on heavenly ground.<a name=3:5></a> You never can understand the mystery but on heavenly ground.<a name=3:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3">Colossians  3</a>the apostle sought to educate the Colossians for this mystery.<a name=3:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		No man gets clear of the intrusion of the flesh until he gets to Gilgal.<a name=3:8></a> I have seen a great many suffer from the Colossian intrusion; it may be loud singing or anything that brings the man to be a contributor to christianity.<a name=3:9></a> We ought to be able to say to every offer of the flesh, I do not want your learning, I do not want your sanctimoniousness; I want nothing but Christ, for I am complete in Him, and He is everything and in all - I am looking up.<a name=3:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You see a great many texts on the walls, but do you see that text, "Seek those things which are above"?<a name=3:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I never did look back that I did not become a spectacle to my fellows - like Lot's wife.<a name=3:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Take Stephen: he looked up, and he saw he had a Saviour in heaven.<a name=3:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You know very little about a person if you only know what he was and not what he is; and that is the difference between the manna and the old corn of the land.<a name=3:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:4">Colossians  1:4</a> they had not the mystery in faith.<a name=3:15></a> They might have nice meetings and the like - not forsaking the gospel.<a name=3:16></a> Demas, for example, did

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is nothing a man so revolts from naturally as to see that this scene is gone.<a name=4:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But though this scene is gone for me, I am supported down here by supplies from the place where my Lord is gone.<a name=4:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		You may have great capacity for enjoyment of this world, but you do not belong to it.<a name=4:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		By the Holy Spirit I walk the path He has trodden up to the place where He is.<a name=4:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are many who have for a moment tasted it; and I would ask, Had you your relatives, you property there?<a name=4:6></a> No; I had only the Lord.<a name=4:7></a> And were you happy without them?<a name=4:8></a> Perfectly so.<a name=4:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are many in heart over Jordan who have never <i>accepted</i> it.<a name=4:10></a> Your acceptance of the new place necessitates dropping everything connected with the old place.<a name=4:11></a> Like a recruit brought to the barrack gate; he drops all the old, the civilian, to get the new.<a name=4:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle said that when he was caught up into the third heaven he did not know whether he was in the body or out of the body.<a name=4:13></a> They say that a man in a balloon gradually loses, first the sense of feeling, then the sight of things below, then his hearing, and lastly, consciousness.<a name=4:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You do not get a right idea of sanctification until you come to this: Paul came down from the place where he did not know whether he was in the body, and now he will have a crippled body.<a name=4:15></a> The more I understand the exaltation, the more I shall be crippled here.<a name=4:16></a>

		Once you separate the church from the gospel, I am prepared for any departure, human subsidy and carnal support of every kind.<a name=4:17></a>

		In the letter the apostle writes to the Colossians he warns them that they had not the mystery in power.<a name=4:18></a> And nothing but the mystery in power can keep you.<a name=4:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		How often an evangelist deplores the state of his converts!<a name=5:4></a> I say, Your converts are the pattern of yourself.<a name=5:5></a> No one ever understood the gospel thoroughly that did not understand the church.<a name=5:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle prayed for the Colossians, for heaven.<a name=5:7></a> The gospel gives you the right to heaven; the church takes you up to heaven.<a name=5:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		During the last sixty years the truth has been fading away in the kingdom of heaven, which has the word of God for its rule, but not the Spirit; while concurrently God has been recovering the truth in the church, His own assembly.<a name=5:13></a>

		<a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#5:9">Joshua  5:9</a> - 11
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe that this truth of <a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#5">Joshua  5</a>is the most difficult stage in the history of a christian.<a name=6:1></a> It is important to understand that Israel was here over Jordan, but not yet in possession of Canaan.<a name=6:2></a> All the trouble about themselves is over.<a name=6:3></a> Now the question I would ask is, Do <i>you</i> know, and are you in the enjoyment of the new place?<a name=6:4></a> Are you in possession?<a name=6:5></a> I do not say, Do you know your title to the new place?<a name=6:6></a> Title and possession are not the same thing.<a name=6:7></a> If you are not sure of your title, you are legal.<a name=6:8></a> If you are sure of your title and do not possess, you are worldly, for something has come in instead.<a name=6:9></a> What are you set for?<a name=6:10></a> Are you bound for enjoying possession now in the place where you are blessed?<a name=6:11></a> The joys of the Father's house are not to be had anywhere but <i>in</i> the house.<a name=6:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this chapter the people were out of Egypt and had reached Canaan; they had passed over Jordan.<a name=6:13></a> They had kept the passover, and got through the Red Sea; that is, in figure, Christ has died for you.<a name=6:14></a> Each heart can say, I am sure of that; but there are really four stages in the history of the christian.<a name=6:15></a> There are four aspects of the death of Christ.<a name=6:16></a> 1, The Passover.<a name=6:17></a> 2, The Red Sea (Christ died <i>for</i> me).<a name=6:18></a> 3, The brazen serpent.<a name=6:19></a> 4, Jordan (I died <i>with</i> Christ).<a name=6:20></a> The first stage is comparatively easy.<a name=6:21></a> It is more difficult as you get near to Canaan, because the enemy's opposition increases as you approach the land, and it culminates in greatest force when you get into the land.<a name=6:22></a> More than six hundred thousand men started out of Egypt.<a name=6:23></a> How many got into the land?<a name=6:24></a> Two!<a name=6:25></a> Why?<a name=6:26></a> Was there any lack of power to carry them in?<a name=6:27></a> No; the same power that gets me out carries me in.<a name=6:28></a>

		It is all one work; God brought Israel out that He might bring them in.<a name=7:1></a> In christendom thousands are saved who never enjoy possession.<a name=7:2></a> The thief on the cross knew Gilgal, though he did not know any wilderness experience.<a name=7:3></a> Everything was rolled off for him on the cross, where he learned the most wonderful expression of divine grace.<a name=7:4></a> There was no wilderness for him, he was brought through all the road at once.<a name=7:5></a> He had to travel the whole distance of man's depravity and distance from God in company with his Saviour.<a name=7:6></a> He knew Gilgal perfectly.<a name=7:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>we get "newness of life", and that implies newness of place.<a name=7:8></a> You must be of a new order, you cannot have the new place without the new order.<a name=7:9></a> You were of the man that was driven out of paradise; where are you now?<a name=7:10></a> How could a man driven out of paradise get into heaven?<a name=7:11></a> If you have a place with God, you cannot be of the order of man that was driven out.<a name=7:12></a> You are a new order of man, and you are fit for the new place.<a name=7:13></a> You have to get assured of the simple fact that you died with Him, and that you are in His life.<a name=7:14></a> In Romans we are "dead to sin", but in Colossians we have died out of the place, we are "dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world".<a name=7:15></a> "Ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God".<a name=7:16></a> What I want to exercise your hearts about is having to do with One who is out of this scene.<a name=7:17></a> Any believer who can say, I know what it is to be over Jordan, I am clear of this place through the death of Christ, must now "lay hold on eternal life".<a name=7:18></a> You are to enjoy life in the sphere that belongs to you.<a name=7:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But being clear of this place through the death of Christ is not possession, it is qualification for possession.<a name=7:20></a> In <a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#5">Joshua  5</a>the people are not in possession, but they are over Jordan; they have the twelve stones taken from the bed of the river.<a name=7:21></a> Gilgal is rolling off the old thing, you part company with the thing that cannot get in; that is what is meant by verse 9.<a name=7:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Circumcision is parting company with the old thing, it could not take place in the wilderness.<a name=8:1></a> It is not Marah, dying to this and that; Gilgal is mortifying my members, for I have left the old place.<a name=8:2></a> I am risen with Christ.<a name=8:3></a> Gilgal is the manner of preparation for possession: "Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth".<a name=8:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want you to be exercised about possession.<a name=8:5></a> Is there to be no progress?<a name=8:6></a> The great lack amongst us is that so few are set for progress.<a name=8:7></a> At Gilgal you come to the place where no quarter is given to the old thing.<a name=8:8></a> Marah is different, I refuse something that I would like to have; but in Gilgal the old thing is rolled off; "put off the old".<a name=8:9></a> The failure of Israel was that they did not keep to Gilgal.<a name=8:10></a> We often speak of being blessed with all spiritual blessings in the heavenly places in Christ.<a name=8:11></a> How can you talk of your blessings if you are not in spirit in the place of blessing?<a name=8:12></a> I have no doubt that we have not known the separating and abounding nature of the enjoyment, the exuberance of the delight; as the apostle says, "Whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:13">2 Corinthians  5:13</a>.<a name=8:13></a> If you are in a scene of unspeakable delight, are you sorry that you have put off the old?<a name=8:14></a> It is joy unspeakable and full of glory.<a name=8:15></a> What I want you to get hold of is this third stage, where there is "rolling off".<a name=8:16></a> There will never be a time here when there will not be something to renounce.<a name=8:17></a> The moment you stop renouncing you stop progressing.<a name=8:18></a> But your renunciation is not that of a monk or a nun, shutting yourself out of the way of the world; you have got into a new scene.<a name=8:19></a> It is more like a recruit brought to the barracks.<a name=8:20></a> He drops the civilian there and wears uniform.<a name=8:21></a> He is a metamorphosed person, nothing is left of the old.<a name=8:22></a> So with us.<a name=8:23></a> It is, "Not I, but Christ".<a name=8:24></a> We are of Christ's order, we belong to Him.<a name=8:25></a> We "have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him".<a name=8:26></a>

		The question I want to lay on every heart is, Am I at Gilgal?<a name=9:1></a> If not, why not?<a name=9:2></a> If you have not been at Gilgal, you certainly do not know what possession is, and you cannot talk of the place where your blessing is; you cannot get the joys of the Father's house anywhere but in the house.<a name=9:3></a> People fail to accept Gilgal.<a name=9:4></a> If Barnabas had been at Gilgal, he would not have had that difference with Paul; <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#15:37">Acts  15:37</a>.<a name=9:5></a> He would not part with his relation.<a name=9:6></a> Natural relationships hinder; there is great danger of being influenced by natural ties.<a name=9:7></a> I have rolled that off, if I have been at Gilgal.<a name=9:8></a> I am not influenced by them there, because I am in a new order of things.<a name=9:9></a>

		If you turn to <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1">2 Timothy  1</a>, you find the trouble that is in the church to this day.<a name=9:10></a> All in Asia had turned away from Paul, not from the gospel, but from the heavenly side of truth.<a name=9:11></a> The heart that is true will not turn away; but how do you account for it that with all the light and knowledge we have we are not more characterised by entering into possession, having present power, and present consciousness of the mind of the Lord?<a name=9:12></a> That is the old corn of the land.<a name=9:13></a> The manna ceased, and then they get the old corn of the land.<a name=9:14></a> The manna is Christ as support, help, priesthood; the old corn of the land is power.<a name=9:15></a> It is the corn of the land in <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3">Philippians  3</a>, "One thing I do".<a name=9:16></a> We cannot do without help, but help is not power.<a name=9:17></a> Power is that I am in Him and He in me.<a name=9:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe there are two reasons why we do not understand Gilgal.<a name=9:19></a> The first is that all turns upon heart for Christ.<a name=9:20></a> First love is gone, we do not feel His absence.<a name=9:21></a> The second reason is that we do not long for His company, to be where He is.<a name=9:22></a> These are, I believe, the two defects.<a name=9:23></a> You cannot be in possession unless you are over Jordan, nor can you have communion without union.<a name=9:24></a> A great deal of work that is done is not according to the Lord's mind, because it is not done in communion.<a name=9:25></a> How could you, if you

		I need hardly say, beloved friends, that the gospel is the good tidings of God, and it is an important thing that He Himself announces the good tidings.<a name=11:1></a> It is not something that we propose to Him, but something which He proposes to us.<a name=11:2></a> The great thing for the soul to get hold of is that it originated with Him.<a name=11:3></a> He desired that the distance which existed between Himself and us should not continue.<a name=11:4></a>

		The first thing is that man has offended against God, and the character of the offence is not merely bad conduct: it is <i>will</i>.<a name=11:5></a> Eve's was not what would be called bad conduct; but it is important for us to understand what sin is.<a name=11:6></a> "The soul that sinneth it shall die".<a name=11:7></a> <i>That being must go</i>.<a name=11:8></a> Could God allow a creature to set up a will against His own will?<a name=11:9></a> That is exactly where Eve was.<a name=11:10></a> She went against God's will.<a name=11:11></a> That is what made Saul the chief of sinners.<a name=11:12></a> His conduct was most exemplary, no one was a better man, "Touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless".<a name=11:13></a>

		Man is sensible of the distance.<a name=11:14></a> In the opening of the history of the Bible, we have two men, Abel and Cain; and these two men, each in a different way, tried to remove the distance - the distance brought in by sin.<a name=11:15></a> The creature had a will contrary to God, and the creature must die.<a name=11:16></a> Why?<a name=11:17></a> Because it has a will; God cannot allow a thing to subsist which is contrary to Himself.<a name=11:18></a> The lost will be the everlasting testimony of God's power in destruction.<a name=11:19></a>

		The first thing I turn to is to look at the epistle itself.<a name=30:12></a> There was only one truth that could preserve the Colossians from an impending snare.<a name=30:13></a> I do not think that they had actually fallen, but they were in danger.<a name=30:14></a> Now every truth has a speciality.<a name=30:15></a> I mean, that special truth alone can correct that special failing, that moral malady.<a name=30:16></a> I do not think the Lord cured any two diseases in the same way.<a name=30:17></a> He put His hand upon one, touched another, and so on.<a name=30:18></a> People say, Oh, this or that truth is not important.<a name=30:19></a> That truth is important, because that truth alone can correct an error you are sure to fall into if you do not have it.<a name=30:20></a>

		You will find in the history of the Lord's ways that He always prepares the servant himself for what he is to accomplish.<a name=77:1></a> The apostle could say, "What ye have .<a name=77:2></a>.<a name=77:3></a>.<a name=77:4></a> heard, and seen in me, do", and "As ye have us for an ensample".<a name=77:5></a> I look at a man who is explaining a thing to me - have you got it yourself?<a name=77:6></a> Yes, I have learnt for myself what I am explaining to you.<a name=77:7></a> Otherwise you are recommending a thing which has no moral effect upon yourself.<a name=77:8></a> That is what so often makes the teaching ineffectual.<a name=77:9></a> A child heard a doctor recommending that he should not take sugar, so he watched the doctor and saw him take sugar.<a name=77:10></a> The child did not think much of <i>that</i> recommendation.<a name=77:11></a> You find throughout the Old Testament that the Lord passes the servant through the thing in which he is to be effectual in ministry.<a name=77:12></a> He gets the good effect of it himself before he presents it to others.<a name=77:13></a> Before a stone is thrown at Stephen, God introduces him to heaven; "he.<a name=77:14></a>.<a name=77:15></a>.<a name=77:16></a> looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus".<a name=77:17></a> The Holy Spirit conducts him to it as his rightful portion.<a name=77:18></a> That brings us back to the gospel.<a name=77:19></a> Here is the great point, to understand what has been effected for me by the death of Christ.<a name=77:20></a> Not only I am cleared of judgment, but I am entitled to a new place.<a name=77:21></a> The prodigal was not only kissed, but he was brought into the new place.<a name=77:22></a> It has been familiarly said that Adam was a gardener, and that he was turned out of his place because of misconduct.<a name=77:23></a> Now I take that as an illustration; supposing the gardener was forgiven: I meet him and say, Well, has your master forgiven you for the way in which you have acted?<a name=77:24></a> Yes, he has.<a name=77:25></a> Has he given you a new place?<a name=77:26></a> Oh, no, he has not forgiven me so far as to reinstate me.<a name=77:27></a> Now that is where many a soul is, and that soul is never at rest.<a name=77:28></a> And he has never pleased his Father yet.<a name=77:29></a> That is the reason why there is so little addressing the Father when you pray: you are at home with the Saviour, but not with the Father.<a name=77:30></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I desire to make a few remarks on the priesthood.<a name=174:1></a> The object of the book of Hebrews is to detach the Jewish converts from the earth, so to present Christ to their hearts that they may be drawn away from the earth to the place where Christ is, and so effectually that you find at the end of the book they are running a race to where Christ is (chapter 12: 1).<a name=174:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The book opens with a fact of the deepest importance to us.<a name=174:3></a> The question of sins is <i>settled</i> (chapter 1: 3).<a name=174:4></a> "Having made by himself the purification of sins, set himself down on the right hand of the greatness on high".<a name=174:5></a> Sins do not belong to the assembly of God.<a name=174:6></a> To introduce sins into the assembly of God is to introduce what has been put away.<a name=174:7></a> If the question of sins is not settled with you, you are not ready for the Priest.<a name=174:8></a> There is the earthly saint and the heavenly saint.<a name=174:9></a> The earthly saint wants the priest on earth, but the heavenly saint knows that his Priest is in heaven, at the right hand of God.<a name=174:10></a> When you take earthly ground, you are wanting Christ to bless you on the earth.<a name=174:11></a> In the Jewish economy the people knew no assurance, no blessing, till the priest <i>came out</i> of the tabernacle.<a name=174:12></a> (See <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#9:23">Leviticus  9:23</a>.<a name=174:13></a>) But we do not wait for that; we have received the Holy Spirit to tell us of heavenly things.<a name=174:14></a> The tendency of us all is to the earth - the portion of the earthly saint.<a name=174:15></a> The apostle's work here is to turn their hearts away from the earth.<a name=174:16></a> The heavenly Priest is for heavenly blessing.<a name=174:17></a>

		The question of sins having been settled, as I have said, in chapter 1, another thing comes out in chapter 2: 14 - "that through death he might annul him who has the might of death, that is, the devil".<a name=174:18></a> It is not only that sins are purged, but the power of Satan, and

		Now the truth is that when grace is received there is a divine work in the soul; a fear of God at first, and then comes relief when there is faith in Christ, "Whom God has set forth a mercy-seat, through faith in his blood .<a name=181:2></a>.<a name=181:3></a>.<a name=181:4></a> in respect of the passing by the sins, .<a name=181:5></a>.<a name=181:6></a>".<a name=181:7></a> <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3:25">Romans  3:25</a>.<a name=181:8></a> There is then the consequence of grace in the soul, there is the sense of forgiveness.<a name=181:9></a> And when we believe in Him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead, then we are justified.<a name=181:10></a> There is no freedom from the judgment of death and the power of the enemy before justification.<a name=181:11></a> "It is God that justifieth"; and "being justified by faith, we have peace with God", an entirely new state, which we could not have if we were not justified, but being justified by the grace of God, we have consequent thereon the new and blessed state of peace.<a name=181:12></a> I could not have the state of peace if I had not received the grace that Christ was delivered for our offences and raised again for our justification.<a name=181:13></a> If there were not the grace, the free gift, there would not be the state that is attached to the recipient of it.<a name=181:14></a> The grace would be of no use to me if it did not confer a state.<a name=181:15></a> If I am not in peace, a new state, I am not justified.<a name=181:16></a> I either have the form of godliness without the power thereof, or I am still seeking peace.<a name=181:17></a>

		It is clearly impossible that so great a work of God - namely, turning a soul from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God - could be without, as a consequence, a remarkable and singular change of state; and this state has two parts one is, how God is known through Christ; the other, our place in Christ before Him.<a name=181:18></a> The former with reference to our being justified, we read of in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:1">Romans  5:1</a> - 11 the other in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>.<a name=181:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, if the consequence or blessing is so marked in the reception of the gospel, which is altogether outside and apart from me, through the work of Christ, and only made known to me in absolute grace, how much more so will it be as we learn our association with Christ, and also our relationship to Him.<a name=182:10></a> I do not doubt that in the reception of each there is the state with two parts: one, as we have seen, how God is known; and secondly, our place in Christ before Him.<a name=182:11></a> If I know association with Christ, the Minister of the holy places, who is not ashamed to call us brethren, I have boldness to enter the holiest of all through the blood of Jesus.<a name=182:12></a> God is known to me as the One whom I can approach in His own unclouded light and unsullied purity.<a name=182:13></a>

		Lastly, in Ephesians we find the same truth and in the same order confirmed and expanded.<a name=183:12></a> We have, in chapter 1, God's calling; His purpose and will that we should be individually in nature and life suited to Him, "holy and blameless before him in love", together with the adoption through Jesus Christ to Himself; and accepted in the Beloved, we are united to Him who is Head over all things to the church.<a name=183:13></a> This is the grace, His free favour which belongs to every believer.<a name=183:14></a> But mark the blessing from this immense favour - God's calling.<a name=183:15></a> It is not merely a great elevation, a position, without conferring any sensible benefit or gain on me.<a name=183:16></a> Nay, on the contrary,

		I desire in these addresses, if the Lord permit, to bring before you the blessings which are peculiar to christianity.<a name=195:1></a> I beg you to bear in mind the words I use, 'peculiar to christianity', that christians only enjoy those blessings, and that they are connected with Christ's exaltation to the right hand of God.<a name=195:2></a> I dare say some here may not quite understand what I mean by peculiar to christians; I mean peculiar to the saints of this present period during the rejection of Christ.<a name=195:3></a> I suppose there is no one here who will not admit that Christ has been rejected on the earth.<a name=195:4></a> Apparently, as to the two disciples journeying to Emmaus, His going away shattered all their hopes of blessing here; so much so that they said, "Thou sojournest alone in Jerusalem, and dost not know what has taken place in it in these days?<a name=195:5></a>" All was over.<a name=195:6></a> It is a terrible thing that God's Son was refused here; hence you read in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#110">Psalm  110</a>, as the Lord quotes it in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#22">Matthew  22</a>, "The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool".<a name=195:7></a> He is called away for a certain time.<a name=195:8></a> Now what occurs in that interval?<a name=195:9></a> It is of the deepest importance that you should bear in mind that He has been called away, but instead of thinking, like the two disciples, that all is over, new blessings come out from Christ in His exaltation; a new company is found on the earth.<a name=195:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I desire to describe the blessings which have come out, and I begin with entrance into the holiest; though I must remark that the varied blessings are so interwoven that you cannot put them in succession.<a name=195:11></a> Still, I think it is a main point for the young believer to get hold of the fact that there is a class of blessings which

		I refer first briefly to <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#16">Leviticus  16</a>.<a name=196:2></a> There are plainly two classes there; there was the high priest and his house, and there was the congregation.<a name=196:3></a> The high priest and his house typifies Christ and the saints of this present time.<a name=196:4></a> The confusion of christendom arises from trying to mingle the two classes, and to bring in the congregation as if that part of the type was fulfilled.<a name=196:5></a> The congregation was not blessed till the priest came out; and the Priest has not come out yet.<a name=196:6></a> He has gone into heaven itself, gone in for His house; "Whose house are we", thank God!<a name=196:7></a> You see this is connected with the fact of His exaltation.<a name=196:8></a>

		I submit that in <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#16">Leviticus  16</a>there is a great difference between the scapegoat and the high priest gone within the veil.<a name=196:9></a> Now that is exactly the difference between the christian blessing, and the blessing of the congregation in the millennial day.<a name=196:10></a> But many christians do not get in their souls beyond the latter blessing.<a name=196:11></a> The scapegoat carried away the people's sins into the land of forgetfulness.<a name=196:12></a> The people of God on the earth, where all their sins were committed, had this wonderful assurance in their souls - all our sins are carried into the land of forgetfulness.<a name=196:13></a> But when the High Priest went into the holiest, it was not a question of sins at all, it was the contrast to sins - the holiness of God.<a name=196:14></a> If you apprehend this one sentence, I think you will understand my aim.<a name=196:15></a> I maintain that in the holiest there is <i>no thought of sin at all</i>, because it is <i>the holiness of God's presence</i>.<a name=196:16></a> It is a wonderful grace to be assured that in the place where all our sins were committed, they are completely removed into the land of forgetfulness; but then you are in the place where they occurred.<a name=196:17></a> But when you enter the holiest of all there is no sin there; it is the contrast -

	<div class="paragraph">
		I now turn to the scripture I read, to show you that we have the right to enter the holiest; this you get in verse 19, "Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus".<a name=197:7></a> Christ is there, and we have now the antitype of <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#16">Leviticus  16</a>; the High Priest has gone in, and we are His companions who share with Him in that place.<a name=197:8></a> I shall prove this, and show you that it is our right.<a name=197:9></a>

		The first thing in the opening of this chapter is that "the worshippers once purged" shall have "no more conscience of sins"; it does not say 'consciousness', but 'conscience'; nothing can be stronger.<a name=197:10></a> In <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1">Hebrews  1</a>we read, "When he had by himself purged our sins, sat down"; here (chapter 10) it is definitely in connection with His exaltation.<a name=197:11></a> Verses 11 - 13 say, "Every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins: but this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, [or continually] sat down on the right hand of God; from henceforth expecting [or waiting] till his enemies be made his footstool".<a name=197:12></a> (See <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#110">Psalm  110</a>to which I have referred.<a name=197:13></a>) The fact of His sitting down there proved that all was done; "there is no more offering for sin".<a name=197:14></a> I dare say some will say, We commit sins; I will come to that presently.<a name=197:15></a> But there are two things which it is necessary to see.<a name=197:16></a> First, that it is God whom you have offended; and secondly, that it is God Himself who has reconciled you to Himself.<a name=197:17></a> "God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself"; He has effected the reconciliation.<a name=197:18></a> I refer to this passage to prove that His sitting down is proof positive that sins are

		It is wonderful grace that in the place where we are, sins are carried into the land of forgetfulness, but we have the right of entrance into the holiest; the difference is, one is negative, and the other positive: one is that sins are gone; but the other is that you enter the sphere of holiness where there never was a spot; you draw near with your heart purged from an evil conscience and your body washed with pure water.<a name=198:11></a> You may say, Do we not get soiled?<a name=198:12></a> I am coming to that presently.<a name=198:13></a> As I said before, you must see two things - that man has offended God, and God Himself has removed the offence: it has been, for every believer, removed from His eye for ever in the sacrifice of His own Son, "that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus".<a name=198:14></a>

		I now turn to <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>, though I cannot go into it fully.<a name=200:1></a> Here I may remark that the Holy Spirit coming down from a glorified Christ to dwell in the believer is another blessing peculiar to a christian.<a name=200:2></a> No saints of whom we read in Scripture will be equally favoured.<a name=200:3></a> They will have the Holy Spirit <i>on</i> them, but not <i>in</i> them; the distinction is an important one.<a name=200:4></a> Hence when Peter quotes Joel to show that the Holy Spirit will be poured out on all flesh, he adds the present blessing, "Having therefore been exalted by the right hand of God, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this which ye behold and hear".<a name=200:5></a> The Holy Spirit was to remain with them and to be in them according to <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>.<a name=200:6></a> We read in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>, "There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus", and then (verse 2), "For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death".<a name=200:7></a> You are justified, and you know the terms on which God can meet you.<a name=200:8></a> Thank God!<a name=200:9></a> That we saw in chapter 5.<a name=200:10></a> But here it is the blessed state in which you are before Him in Christ; the Spirit is in you, and you have liberty.<a name=200:11></a> "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh", that is, sin has been condemned, not only is there no more remembrance of sins, but sin has been condemned.<a name=200:12></a> At the close of <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9">Hebrews  9</a>we read that He hath appeared "to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself", and He "was once offered to bear the sins of many".<a name=200:13></a>

		There is one point more I would like to say a word on.<a name=204:8></a> It is as to losing communion; I think sometimes we are not sensitive enough about it; and it is connected with the holiest.<a name=204:9></a> It is a remark of much value, that Peter's conscience was relieved in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>, but his heart was not until chapter 21.<a name=204:10></a> Many christians walk with a clear conscience who have not yet known intimacy with Christ.<a name=204:11></a> If you are not acquainted with Him, you cannot be conscious of a break in it.<a name=204:12></a> You may be like Peter, with your conscience relieved, and happy affections restored, but the root of the failure not touched, as in <a href="../bible/John.htm#21">John  21</a>, when the Lord said to him, "Lovest thou me more than these?<a name=204:13></a>" The root of his failure was that he was seeking to be prominent above all the disciples for loving the Lord.<a name=204:14></a> The very quality for which you think you are creditable is the one in which you will fail most, and then you will be humbled; here the washing of the feet applies.<a name=204:15></a> As has been said, and very truly, advocacy is always going on; but when your feet are washed you are conscious of it.<a name=204:16></a>

		The subject I have already commenced and desire to continue is, the blessings peculiar to the christian.<a name=206:1></a> We find that these blessings date from the time when the Lord had gone away, and was exalted to God's right hand; then blessings of a new character were vouchsafed to His own on this earth, where He had been rejected.<a name=206:2></a> On the former evening I was dwelling on the difference between being assured that our sins, where they were committed, have been carried into the land of forgetfulness - a very great thing to know - and the knowledge that we also have the right of entrance into the holiest.<a name=206:3></a> "Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh".<a name=206:4></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I must refer to several scriptures, and I trust you will be able to take a note of them.<a name=207:4></a> The work of the Spirit is divided into two parts in John's gospel, and I think it is a great help to see this; the Holy Spirit is given for your benefit, and also for Christ's service.<a name=207:5></a> Now there is a danger of confounding these.<a name=207:6></a> Turn to <a href="../bible/John.htm#4:14">John  4:14</a> - "Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well [or rather, a fountain] of water springing up into everlasting life".<a name=207:7></a> Plainly this is in yourself.<a name=207:8></a> It is entirely new, and a contrast to <a href="../bible/John.htm#2">John  2</a>, where the wine was out, while this marvellous gift is to be in you.<a name=207:9></a> There is a new power in you, and that power the Spirit of God.<a name=207:10></a> You could not know the things of God unless by the Spirit of God.<a name=207:11></a> Everything you know of God, you know by the Spirit of God; and you never lose that knowledge.<a name=207:12></a> You may lose something you had heard, or a conception of your own mind, but you will never lose anything the Spirit of God has imparted; it is yours; and that is properly your true state.<a name=207:13></a> You start with this fact, that all the will of God for you has been finished by Christ; you do not know it all, but it is all done.<a name=207:14></a> The Spirit of God gives you conscious knowledge of His work, and all you learn by the Spirit of God remains.<a name=207:15></a> If you are under a cloud, you lose your enjoyment of this grace, but when the cloud is

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For the first part of the Spirit's work, I turn to <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:1">Romans  5:1</a> - 11.<a name=208:5></a> I believe the first great thing that a believer learns by the Spirit of God is the terms on which God can be with him.<a name=208:6></a> You have offended against God.<a name=208:7></a> The mistake often is that souls are not set on ascertaining how God, whom they have offended, stands towards them.<a name=208:8></a> Their conscience, or how they can be relieved, is before them.<a name=208:9></a> Now the first 11 verses of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>set forth how God is towards you; that is, if I may use a familiar phrase, the terms of affection on which He is, so that "we also joy [or boast] in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement [or reconciliation]".<a name=208:10></a> The prodigal son could say, I never expected that my father would be on such loving terms with me.<a name=208:11></a> I was trying to be on terms with him, but I find he is on terms with me.<a name=208:12></a> The Spirit leads you into the joy of this great acceptance.<a name=208:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I must add to this <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>.<a name=208:14></a> It is the saying of another, that as chapter 5: 1 - 11 sets forth how God meets you, so chapter 8 sets forth how you are in Christ before Him.<a name=208:15></a> The Spirit effects it.<a name=208:16></a> Verse 2 says, "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death".<a name=208:17></a> If you would understand the greatness of the gift in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4:14">John  4:14</a>, you must study <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>.<a name=208:18></a> You will find there four parts of the work of the Spirit.<a name=208:19></a> First, "If ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live".<a name=208:20></a> Marvellous grace!<a name=208:21></a> The second is the greatness of your relationship: "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God".<a name=208:22></a> The third is that, though you are in a groaning creation, you are "waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I trust I have given you some idea of the first work of the Spirit.<a name=209:3></a> I merely add that if you do not know this work you will not advance to any other.<a name=209:4></a> The Corinthians and the Galatians failed here; they were not dead to sin; though they had the Spirit, they did not know His first work, as detailed in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>and 8.<a name=209:5></a> It is most blessed that the Spirit of God first settles questions about yourself, for you have not rest of heart until they are settled; hence many are looking for holiness by faith, or perfectionism, simply because they are not in the power of the Spirit.<a name=209:6></a> When you walk in the Spirit you are superior to the flesh.<a name=209:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For the next work, I turn to <a href="../bible/John.htm#7:37">John  7:37</a> - 39: "In the last, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried saying, If any one thirst, let him come to me, and drink.<a name=209:8></a> He that believes on me, as the scripture has said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.<a name=209:9></a> But this he said concerning the Spirit, which they that believed on him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified".<a name=209:10></a> I know it is often thought that this refers to serving others; but I think the meaning is that your blessing is so full that it overflows.<a name=209:11></a> On the last day of the feast of tabernacles, as they were celebrating how God had made the earth to minister to them, the Lord challenged them, when He said, "If any one thirst, let him come to me, and drink".<a name=209:12></a> I can do infinitely better for him.<a name=209:13></a> The state of those here is a contrast to chapter 4; there we see a woman in the most deplorable condition, and the grace of God will set her up in a most blessed way.<a name=209:14></a> Here man is surrounded with every earthly blessing, and the Lord

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next work of the Spirit I find in Hebrews.<a name=210:10></a> It is this, that if you have learnt something of the resources which are in Christ, you are soon aware that He who is so much to you is not here.<a name=210:11></a> I hope to go into this blessed subject fully another time, if the Lord permit me.<a name=210:12></a> I refer to the priesthood of Christ: He can sympathise with you in the greatest weakness, because of sorrow and pressure here, and He also would maintain you in the brightest spot in the presence of God.<a name=210:13></a> The effect is that you are drawn away from earth to a Person who is not here, you are attached to Christ in another place; hence I consider it a distinct progress in the Spirit's work.<a name=210:14></a> I am pointing out, as far as I see, the order in which the Spirit of God works in the believer.<a name=210:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is one thing of deep importance that I cannot fully explain; it is, that every christian in his behaviour, in his body, discloses the measure of the Spirit's work in him.<a name=210:16></a> I will give you three examples.<a name=210:17></a> The first is in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12">Romans  12</a>"that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice.<a name=210:18></a>.<a name=210:19></a>.<a name=210:20></a>.<a name=210:21></a> Be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind".<a name=210:22></a> Surely that is your body, your personal appearance?<a name=210:23></a> I do not mean merely dress; I mean your whole bearing.<a name=210:24></a> The second is, not merely that you are not conformed to this world, but that you are transformed into the same image (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#3:18">2 Corinthians  3:18</a>).<a name=210:25></a> This is a great advance.<a name=210:26></a> And again, running the race set before us, looking out unto Jesus, encountering every obstacle

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next work of the Spirit is to lead you to be here for Christ.<a name=211:3></a> He was here for you; the Spirit first makes this known to you, then He leads you to be here for Him.<a name=211:4></a> The Lord in <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>and 14, knowing that He came from God and went to God, prepares His disciples to be here for Him in His absence.<a name=211:5></a> It is in the assembly you learn your calling and duty: you are to have part with Him outside and above everything here.<a name=211:6></a> He has gone to the Father.<a name=211:7></a> He is supreme, and as you are led by the Spirit, you please Him in your service.<a name=211:8></a> To this end the Spirit of God was to bring all things to their remembrance whatsoever He had said to them.<a name=211:9></a> There were two periods in the Lord's life on earth; there were thirty years of private life, and three years of public life.<a name=211:10></a> It is to the three years of public life the Lord alludes here.<a name=211:11></a> You will find the importance of it.<a name=211:12></a> In the thirty years of His private life He set forth what a Man was to the eye of God, so that at the close the Father announces, "Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased".<a name=211:13></a> But in the three years of His ministry He was setting forth what the Father was to man - quite different - and hence, at the close of this period, when on the holy mount, the voice came, "This is my beloved Son: hear him", as you read in the gospel narrative.<a name=211:14></a> It is in the assembly that we get our mission, as we learn from <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>, which is the assembly in pattern: "As my Father hath sent me, even so send I you".<a name=211:15></a> The work of the Spirit, in order to fit us for service, is enunciated in chapter 14, and it is only as this work is known that you are qualified for service; you receive considerably for yourselves in order to be of use to others.<a name=211:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next work of the Spirit is in <a href="../bible/John.htm#15">John  15</a>.<a name=211:17></a> You have come out here to be as the branches of Christ;

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next work I do not find easy to explain, because the less we know of a truth the less we can explain it.<a name=212:4></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#15:26">John  15:26</a> we come to another action of the Holy Spirit: "When the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me".<a name=212:5></a> I ask you to bear in mind the difference between the Spirit's work in chapter 14 and His work in chapter 15.<a name=212:6></a> I am trying to show you the great position in which you are set on the earth.<a name=212:7></a> In chapter 14 you are prepared for service.<a name=212:8></a> But in chapter 15 you bear fruit, you are His branches, His servants.<a name=212:9></a> Here in chapter 15: 26 the Holy Spirit is sent from Christ in heaven for a special purpose: "he shall testify of me".<a name=212:10></a> It was not merely to testify <i>for</i> Me, it is to "testify <i>of</i> me".<a name=212:11></a> I cannot conceive anything greater than this - that the Holy Spirit should enable you to stand forth here in testimony of Christ in heaven, as well as to bear fruit.<a name=212:12></a> You are both a servant and a witness.<a name=212:13></a> I see many serving who are not witnessing.<a name=212:14></a> A witness testifies of a Man whom the world would not have - the heavenly Man.<a name=212:15></a> Here doubtless we enter on the epistle to the Ephesians; you must be a heavenly man before you can testify of Christ in heaven.<a name=212:16></a> No one else could do it.<a name=212:17></a> I cannot dwell on this, but I trust you see that the Spirit leads you to testify of the heavenly Man on the earth.<a name=212:18></a> Though this will expose you to all the opposition of Satan, yet you will be personally, in the armour of God and in the power of His might, able to withstand all Satan's wiles; you will come out in a new character.<a name=212:19></a> As I have said, your manner of life always indicates the measure in which the Spirit of God works in

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I must add a little on <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>.<a name=213:4></a> The Spirit, according to it, enables us to be here as belonging to the Father, kept by Him and learning of Him in such unity and sanctification that the world should believe that He had sent Christ; and eventually that the world should know, not only that Christ was sent, but that we are loved by the Father as Christ is loved.<a name=213:5></a> The more we are led by the Spirit, the better we shall apprehend the great place to which we are called here during the absence of Christ.<a name=213:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In conclusion I would call your attention very briefly to a subject very often overlooked.<a name=213:7></a> It is, that as we suffer with Christ we shall reign with Him.<a name=213:8></a> I have already stated that your body indicates the measure of the Spirit's work in you, it characterises you.<a name=213:9></a> Everything you do, "the deeds of the body", will affect your position with the Lord when He comes to reign.<a name=213:10></a> Hence the Spirit leads you to look for the coming of the Lord: "The Spirit and the bride say, Come".<a name=213:11></a> People speak of going to heaven; I would add, Are you waiting for His Son from heaven?<a name=213:12></a> Every believer without doubt will go to heaven; but it is as you suffer, or endure with Him, that you shall reign with Him.<a name=213:13></a> The harder your life is here for Christ, the better will be your place with Christ in the kingdom.<a name=213:14></a> If you have an easy life here, you will have a very small place in the kingdom.<a name=213:15></a> And therefore if you are walking in the Spirit, He is sure to lead you; it is not a question of how much you do, but how the Spirit leads you to be here for Christ; not so much what you do, but that you endure.<a name=213:16></a>

		I think many, with very little ostentation, are well-pleasing unto the Lord, like a star which you see in a dark night, or like Mary sitting at His feet, hearing His word; she was doing nothing apparently, while Martha was very busy; yet Mary had chosen the good part, she was seeking her Lord's mind.<a name=214:1></a> And if you are led by the Spirit, it will be with you as it was with Mary; when she did act, she quite surpassed Martha.<a name=214:2></a> In order to complete the subject of the leading of the Spirit, you must learn that He is conducting you here in view of the kingdom.<a name=214:3></a> James and John asked for the chief places; the Lord answered, "It shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father".<a name=214:4></a> I fear that there is too much indifference about the kingdom generally.<a name=214:5></a> Are you thinking that Christ will reign here?<a name=214:6></a> In the epistles I find the kingdom much referred to.<a name=214:7></a> Saints were thinking of the Lord coming to reign, to take His place here; hence "the day of the Lord", or the appearing of the Lord, is kept prominently before them.<a name=214:8></a>

		Our subject this evening is, our Priest is in heaven.<a name=215:1></a> I must press upon you, beloved friends, that you will not comprehend the subjects which I am bringing before you unless you realise that Christ has been rejected here, and that the christian's blessings are consequent on His exaltation to God's right hand.<a name=215:2></a> In <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#22">Matthew  22</a>there is a quotation from <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#110">Psalm  110</a>

		"The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand".<a name=215:3></a> I want you to apprehend the gravity of this fact, that the Son of God has been rejected in the world, the scene where we are.<a name=215:4></a> The world was never so guilty, for God was never so fully revealed; and He was never so absolutely refused: "Now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father": "they have no cloke for their sin".<a name=215:5></a> If you do not apprehend the gravity of His rejection, you cannot take in, you cannot seize, the greatness of the blessings which have come out from God, consequent on Christ's exaltation to His right hand.<a name=215:6></a> The mass of christians think of Christ as He was on the earth, and they speak of Him as Jesus; but Jesus is not on the earth; He once was.<a name=215:7></a> The pious sometimes speak of Him as King; He is not yet King, He was refused here.<a name=215:8></a>

		The subject this evening is, that our Priest is in heaven; and the greater the subject the more it is perverted in christendom.<a name=215:9></a> It is not intentional, but the attempt to explain the word of God by the human mind has perverted it.<a name=215:10></a> The unfailing mark of a human interpretation of the word of God is that God's side is omitted, the human mind cannot take it in.<a name=215:11></a> In christendom they have a priest or a minister between them and God.<a name=215:12></a> The human mind has the word of God as to the fact that there is a priest for the

		christian, but it has perverted it by placing the priest on man's side.<a name=216:1></a> Nothing can be a greater perversion than the attempt to set up a priest on the earth.<a name=216:2></a> Among the more enlightened christians a clergyman cannot pronounce the blessing unless he is priested.<a name=216:3></a> Their priesthood is not of Christ, for if He were on earth, He would not be a priest.<a name=216:4></a> You have a Priest, but He is a Priest only in heaven; this must be accepted.<a name=216:5></a> You may ask, Must I be in heaven to know my Priest?<a name=216:6></a> You are not looked at as in heaven in the book of Hebrews; you are running to heaven, and your Priest is there and is not here.<a name=216:7></a> If you say, I do not understand it, you should be troubled at your state, that you are satisfied to be here without knowing Christ as your Priest.<a name=216:8></a> The first thing to see is that consequent on Christ's rejection, He is our Priest in heaven.<a name=216:9></a> Though apparently the sun had gone down at noonday and there was no more hope, yet then God, in the boundlessness of His goodness, made known entirely new blessings, as we read, "Who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings".<a name=216:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first point is that your Priest is not here; He is in heaven.<a name=216:11></a> If you do not accept this, you will not understand nor enjoy the blessing connected with this truth.<a name=216:12></a>

		The book of Hebrews opens in an important way: God, having spoken by the prophets, now speaks by the Son.<a name=216:13></a> It is divine.<a name=216:14></a> In chapter 2 we read, "As the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same".<a name=216:15></a> And in connection with this I will turn to verses 11 and 12.<a name=216:16></a> "For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee".<a name=216:17></a> Now you see that we are His brethren.<a name=216:18></a> We read in <a href="../bible/John.htm#12">John  12</a>, "Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone:

		but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit", or 'many grains', that is, a new order of man springs from Him.<a name=217:1></a> Adam was the earthly order.<a name=217:2></a> Christ is the heavenly order; hence, "Both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren".<a name=217:3></a> The apostle is writing to Hebrews, who naturally would have said, Christ is of our stock: but no, we are <i>His</i> brethren, "all of one".<a name=217:4></a> It is of immense blessing to apprehend this.<a name=217:5></a> Through grace you are brethren of Christ.<a name=217:6></a> Christ had no brethren before His death.<a name=217:7></a> True, we read of His brethren in the gospel, brethren according to the flesh.<a name=217:8></a> But He was alone - a beautiful, peculiar, unique Man in the sight of God.<a name=217:9></a> He had no fellow until He rose; when He died He removed that which was in the way, and now He is not ashamed to call us brethren; we are really of Him.<a name=217:10></a> You must start in the assurance of this grace.<a name=217:11></a> The tendency of the Hebrews, from education and Jewish feelings, was to settle down on the earth; hence the great object of the book is so to attract them to the Lord where He is, that they might be drawn away from the earth.<a name=217:12></a> I do not believe any one is drawn away from the earth unless he is attracted by a Person who is not here.<a name=217:13></a> It is plain that if your heart is taken up with a person who has gone to another place, you are drawn away from the place where you are to where he is.<a name=217:14></a> 'Love enchants the spot where the loved one dwells'.<a name=217:15></a> Christ has gone away, but you are His brethren; He is not ashamed to call us brethren - "whosoever is born of God sinneth not".<a name=217:16></a> I believe you get immense comfort from the fact that you are His brethren.<a name=217:17></a> In chapter 3, we read, "Holy brethren".<a name=217:18></a> Turn now to chapter 3: 6: "But Christ as a son over his own house;" - that is, God's house - "whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end".<a name=217:19></a> It is not only that we are His brethren, but we are His house, made partakers

		Turn now to the end of chapter 4, that you may apprehend the great blessing of a Priest in heaven.<a name=218:4></a> The Hebrews had not turned back, but they were in danger of being like their forefathers; not going to heaven, just as their forefathers had refused to go up to the land on the plea that they were not able to do so.<a name=218:5></a> Caleb tried to still the people in his day, and said, "If the Lord delight in us, then he will bring us into this land".<a name=218:6></a> Hence, in chapter 4 we read, "Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief".<a name=218:7></a> The "rest" was really the rest of God.<a name=218:8></a> Now come out two great helps.<a name=218:9></a> The word of God is one, and Christ the Priest in heaven is the other.<a name=218:10></a> Of the latter we read: "Haying therefore a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast the confession.<a name=218:11></a> For we have not a high priest not able to sympathise with our infirmities, but tempted in all things in like manner, sin apart.<a name=218:12></a> Let us approach therefore with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and find grace for seasonable help".<a name=218:13></a> Now bear in mind that you are His brethren and His house - His companions.<a name=218:14></a> In <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#16">Leviticus  16</a>we read that Aaron offered a bullock for himself and his house.<a name=218:15></a> So far the type has been fulfilled; the remainder, as to the congregation, has not been fulfilled as yet, because the Priest has not come out to bless the people.<a name=218:16></a> (See chapter 9: 23.<a name=218:17></a>) The subject is your infirmities, not your sins; weakness from any cause; the pressure of circumstances, or illness, or - the greatest of all - bereavement: still it is pressure; you are weak, and ready to droop under it.<a name=218:18></a> As I have said, there are two helps.<a name=218:19></a> First, the word of God exposes

	<div class="paragraph">
		where you are, reveals your motives, whether you are making your weakness an excuse not to go on - engrossed with the pressure instead of with the rest of God.<a name=219:1></a> You are very ill, or sorrowful, or bereaved, or greatly oppressed by circumstances; now the word discloses all: "All things are naked and laid bare to his eyes with whom we have to do".<a name=219:2></a> Then follows in verse 14: "Having therefore a great high priest" - mark the language - "who has passed through the heavens", - as Aaron passed through the holy places - "Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast the confession.<a name=219:3></a> For we have not a high priest not able to sympathise with our infirmities, but tempted in all things in like manner, sin apart".<a name=219:4></a> Do not give up.<a name=219:5></a> Our Priest in heaven sympathises with us.<a name=219:6></a> He is outside of everything here, He has gone through every pressure.<a name=219:7></a> His sympathy is not the same kind of help that you read of in the Psalms, when God made a way in the sea, and the like, by His mighty hand; but here it is that you have a Person, the Lord Jesus Christ; you are brethren to Him, you are His house, and He was in the circumstances that we are in, and He knows what they are, and He sympathises with us in them; He bears us company in the pressure.<a name=219:8></a> Take the case of a person in bereavement: no pressure - severe illness or great pain - is equal to the agony of bereavement; there can be no alleviation of the blank, for no one can repair the blank but the one who has caused it.<a name=219:9></a> Now the marvellous grace is, though it be little understood, that the Lord uses the blank as the opportunity for making Himself known in the tenderest way.<a name=219:10></a> As you see with Mary, in <a href="../bible/John.htm#11">John  11</a>, He walked with her, and impressed her with the assurance, as He wept beside her, that if she had lost a brother she had found "a friend that sticketh closer than a brother" in Himself, that she had really gained.<a name=219:11></a> You may think it impossible; but the Lord is so much to you that you are borne up and drawn to Him.<a name=219:12></a> The word

	<div class="paragraph">
		The sense of His nearness as One above it all, but having passed through it, endears Him to you in a peculiar way.<a name=220:2></a> It is not that He removes the pressure, but He so supports you that you are so raised above it by His sympathy that instead of drooping under the pressure, you come boldly to the throne of grace.<a name=220:3></a> But I would press on you, and I trust the Lord will lead you to apprehend, that whatever the pressure is, the Lord would come to you and be such a solace and support to you, that He would be more endeared to you than ever before.<a name=220:4></a> When He relieves you, things are easier for you here, but when He bears you above the pressure, you will never forget it; He Himself becomes indispensable to you.<a name=220:5></a> This in a measure I dare say Ruth found in Naomi - a solace to her in the hour of her sorrow.<a name=220:6></a> The Lord can come close beside us in our sorrow, and share with us in it, and so lift us above the pressure to the height of Himself.<a name=220:7></a> May we all better understand His sympathy.<a name=220:8></a> Every one can speak of a mercy.<a name=220:9></a> But can you speak of being lifted above the pressure in company with the Lord who sympathises with you?<a name=220:10></a> You must bear in mind that the great object of the book of Hebrews is to make the Lord, who is not here, so dear to your heart that you will be drawn away from this place to Him, who has so endeared Himself to you that He is indispensable.<a name=220:11></a>

		I turn now to chapter 10: 19 - 22: "Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh; and having an high priest over the house of God; let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water".<a name=220:12></a> The High Priest in chapter 4 comes down to your lowest point, under the deepest pressure,

		"in all points tempted like as we are", so that He is able to sympathise with you, to bind you to Himself.<a name=221:1></a> Now you are in company with Him, you are of His house.<a name=221:2></a> In the type, Aaron offered a bullock for himself and his house.<a name=221:3></a> We are, through grace, the consecrated company, and all can enter in a common fragrance into the holiest where He Himself is.<a name=221:4></a> In the holiest there was the golden censer, the ark of the covenant, and the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy-seat.<a name=221:5></a> If I were speaking to a gentile, I should speak of the Lord's glory, of which the holiest was a type.<a name=221:6></a> Now you can draw near and be maintained by our great Priest in the brightest spot.<a name=221:7></a> You have the right to enter into the holiest in company with Himself.<a name=221:8></a>

		In the close of chapter 10 you have the effect on you when your heart is drawn to a Person who is not here, but is in another place.<a name=221:9></a> You will long to get to the place where He is; as the Lord is endeared to you, so is the place where He is.<a name=221:10></a> Hence the Lord said to His disciples, "Whither I go ye know, and the way ye know".<a name=221:11></a> The Lord counted on their knowing.<a name=221:12></a> Is your heart attracted to the Lord?<a name=221:13></a> Where is He?<a name=221:14></a> In heaven.<a name=221:15></a> Then are you going on to heaven?<a name=221:16></a> Or are you trying to be comfortable on the earth, the place <i>where He is not</i>?<a name=221:17></a> Then be assured that you are not much drawn to Him.<a name=221:18></a> At the same time I quite admit a certain amount of comfort is necessary.<a name=221:19></a> I think a person is distracted when he is uncomfortable; but that is a different thing; the point is, Who is paramount with you?<a name=221:20></a> "Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also".<a name=221:21></a> Where is He?<a name=221:22></a> You can say, He is my Saviour.<a name=221:23></a> Yes, but I want you to be able to say, He is the One that meets me in the lowest condition in which I can be found; in my weakest moment He comes to me, when no other hand or heart could come near me, and assures me of the interest He takes in me, and so draws me to Himself that I am

		lifted out of it to have company with Himself.<a name=222:1></a> And I do not believe He lifts you out of it for anything else but to have company with Himself.<a name=222:2></a> If you know Christ in His priestly service, you are so drawn to Him that you can say, "We are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul".<a name=222:3></a> And then you are set on leaving this place for the place where Christ is.<a name=222:4></a> It is not dying, it is simply as with Israel, they had to journey through the wilderness in order to possess the land, and through faith in God they could surmount every difficulty; so you are in faith to surmount every difficulty until you are with Christ where He is.<a name=222:5></a> Hence you read in chapter 12: 1, 2, "Let us also therefore, having so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, laying aside every weight, and sin which so easily entangles us, run with endurance the race that lies before us, looking stedfastly on Jesus the leader and completer of faith: who, in view of the joy lying before him, endured the cross, having despised the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God".<a name=222:6></a> It is a simple question: Are you set for Christ where He is?<a name=222:7></a> Would to God I had been more set for it!<a name=222:8></a> I should have had a happier course; one is very easily turned aside by something here; but if your heart is really fixed on Him, then nothing could divert you.<a name=222:9></a> I may illustrate my meaning by a dog's fidelity in following its master; all the wit of your head would not divert the dog from following; you might beat it, or tempt it, but nothing would induce it to swerve.<a name=222:10></a> The right idea of following we get in the words of Ruth, "Whither thou goest, I will go".<a name=222:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now you will encounter difficulties; and you cannot surmount difficulties but by faith, and therefore you are looking off unto Jesus the author and finisher of faith; He has gone the road, and you are His brethren through divine grace, and He gives you of His grace, and you are looking out to where He is; you are

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 12 the importance of discipline is described.<a name=223:3></a> As I understand, the discipline here is not for failure, but to help you, even that you might be partakers of His holiness.<a name=223:4></a> Stephen's suffering in testimony, God turns to good account for him, even to remove everything which would separate him from the Lord.<a name=223:5></a> As we read in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4">2 Corinthians  4</a>, "We which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake".<a name=223:6></a> There is a very great difference between discipline to help you and discipline to correct you.<a name=223:7></a> Jacob at Shechem was disciplined to correct him; he suffers greatly from the Shechemites.<a name=223:8></a> But he goes to Bethel - a very bright day; Rebekah's nurse dies, and the place is called Allon-bachuth, the oak of weeping.<a name=223:9></a> This was discipline to help him; to clear away every thing unsuited to his bright position.<a name=223:10></a>

		I turn for a little to chapter 12: 18, "Ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched", etc.<a name=223:11></a> You are not come to God in that way; you now have the right of entrance into His presence.<a name=223:12></a> Verses 22 - 24 go on: "But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, to the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, and to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel".<a name=223:13></a> It begins at the chief place on the earth, mount Sion; there will be a day when God will rule in mount Sion: "The LORD shall send the rod

	<div class="paragraph">
		In conclusion, one word on chapter 13.<a name=224:8></a> Here your true appearance on the earth is described in the simplest way.<a name=224:9></a> The first point is, "Let brotherly love continue".<a name=224:10></a> You may think that is easy, but you will find this requires most grace; you can love saints who are going on well, but when they are in error and wilful, then we find how little we love them.<a name=224:11></a> Next, "Be not forgetful to entertain strangers"; hospitality to christians, I suppose.<a name=224:12></a> And then, "Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them"; then the domestic circle, "Marriage is honourable in all".<a name=224:13></a> Then comes a very important mark, which often a christian lacks, and we all know how ready we are to fail as to it: "Be content with such things as ye have".<a name=224:14></a> Who is content with such things as he has?<a name=224:15></a> A man in the world is nobody if he is not set on acquiring.<a name=224:16></a> "Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.<a name=224:17></a> So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my

		I turn next to our Lord's words in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>"I go to prepare a place for you".<a name=227:7></a> Some commentators think He is now preparing it.<a name=227:8></a> No; your place was prepared when He went there.<a name=227:9></a> This is a corroboration of what I have said, that the earth could not be your place, seeing that there is a place prepared for you in the Father's house.<a name=227:10></a> When you realise that you have a place in heaven, it has the effect, though you never were there, of drawing you to the Lord who has gone to that place; and if your hearts were true to Him, no other place could fully please you.<a name=227:11></a> The Lord counts on this when He says, "Whither I go ye know, and the way ye know".<a name=227:12></a> Can we all say we know the way?<a name=227:13></a> Like Thomas, we have to say at first: "We know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?<a name=227:14></a>" If your heart is simply fixed on Christ, you will soon find the way.<a name=227:15></a> Surely deep affection would soon find out where He is.<a name=227:16></a> This was the distress of Mary Magdalene: "They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him".<a name=227:17></a> The Lord then tells where He would be.<a name=227:18></a> Evidently it is one of the rewards connected with service: "If any man serve me, let him follow me; and

		Again, if you do not accept heaven as your place, you will not enjoy the blessings peculiar to you as a christian.<a name=228:4></a> I turn to <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#14:15">Luke  14:15</a>.<a name=228:5></a> A pious man said, "Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God"; no doubt with reference to the millennial day.<a name=228:6></a> The Lord replied, as much as to say, There is something before that - "A certain man made a great supper".<a name=228:7></a> Now, beloved friends, the first question is <i>where</i> the great supper is.<a name=228:8></a> The supper is in the house, and not in the land.<a name=228:9></a> Israel, man naturally, would like to find it on the earth.<a name=228:10></a> Many christians - alas!<a name=228:11></a> I have done it myself - look for blessings in the wrong place.<a name=228:12></a> One buys a piece of land.<a name=228:13></a> There is no sin in a piece of land, but it is a gain in the wrong place.<a name=228:14></a> The first thought of every man, even of the working man, is to purchase enough ground to build a house on, and he thinks that it is a mark of God's favour when he succeeds.<a name=228:15></a> You cannot do without a house, I admit; but you are seeking possessions here in the wrong place.<a name=228:16></a> Are you not often drawn away from the Lord by something here?<a name=228:17></a> You are looking for blessings, advantages, in the place where Christ was rejected!<a name=228:18></a> Hence the servant was told to go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come into the house - not the land.<a name=228:19></a> Some quote this passage and say, Come to Christ.<a name=228:20></a> Of course, if any one does not come to Christ, he could not come into the house, to the feast, but the feast is the celebration of grace.<a name=228:21></a> It has been remarked that you get the feast in chapter 14, and the guest in chapter 15.<a name=228:22></a> But where is the feast?<a name=228:23></a> It is in the house.<a name=228:24></a> In the passage, "When he hath found it" [the sheep],

		The Galatians, on the other hand, were seeking to improve the first man.<a name=231:1></a> I quite see that you might be clear of those two failures, but I want you to lay hold of the fact that one who has the Spirit of God, as the Corinthians and the Galatians had, may not have Christ as the paramount object.<a name=231:2></a> With every one walking in the Spirit, Christ is paramount; and you learn from the way the apostle corrects both the Corinthians and the Galatians, where the lack was.<a name=231:3></a> He corrects the Corinthians by presenting Christ in glory outside of everything here.<a name=231:4></a> The effect was that the flesh was in abeyance; it could not be in the glory of God.<a name=231:5></a> If Christ is paramount with you, your heart is fixed on Him.<a name=231:6></a> Christ in glory supersedes the man here; there is no place for him there.<a name=231:7></a> On the contrary, you are transformed into the same image, and practically the effect is that you would be "always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus".<a name=231:8></a> It is important to see that not only does the Holy Spirit dwell in you, but that Christ is in His true place when you are walking in the Spirit.<a name=231:9></a> In like manner, with the Galatians, the apostle sets Isaac in his right place, and then Ishmael must go out; that is, the man under the law must be cast out.<a name=231:10></a> If you are occupied with the man born after the flesh, you are sanctioning the Ishmael who persecutes Christ.<a name=231:11></a> You belong to Christ in heaven, and the Spirit of God has come to you from Him in heaven, and as you walk in the Spirit, Christ is paramount, and you are in this world for Him.<a name=231:12></a> I have not come to your service yet, I am speaking of your gain personally when you receive the Spirit.<a name=231:13></a> I fear there are many who do not walk in the Spirit, hence they rejoice only in their salvation; they have not the power to act here for Christ.<a name=231:14></a> But when you are walking in the Spirit, His normal action in you is to lead you to heaven.<a name=231:15></a> "Being full of the Holy Spirit" he "fixed his eyes on heaven".<a name=231:16></a> If you meditate for a moment you will see that it must be so.<a name=231:17></a>

		I turn now to <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3">Colossians  3</a>.<a name=244:1></a> The Colossians were a faithful company; they had faith in Christ Jesus, and love to all the saints, but they did not know the mystery.<a name=244:2></a> Now if you have accepted that in coming to Christ in the assembly, you come to Him outside of the world which refused Him, you will be prepared for another step, even that you come <i>from</i> Him.<a name=244:3></a> You not only come <i>to</i> Him, the "living stone", but as members of His body you come <i>from</i> Him.<a name=244:4></a> The Colossians, as I have said, did not know the mystery, hence the apostle tells them that he had great conflict for them.<a name=244:5></a> There would not be a great conflict if there had not been a great opposition.<a name=244:6></a> As far as I know, I do not think there is much knowledge of Christ as Head, which is the part of the mystery referred to here.<a name=244:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Colossians were an exemplary company, but they did not know Christ as Head.<a name=244:8></a> I must not speak beyond my measure, but I believe the consciousness of Christ as Head cannot be surpassed - even that you have parted with your own head, and hence you are "dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world", and are risen with Him: "Ye are dead [or have died], and your life is hid with Christ in God".<a name=244:9></a> And what then?<a name=244:10></a> When you accept the circumcision effected in Christ, you are where no human voice is heard, where "there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all".<a name=244:11></a> Now you know Him as Head.<a name=244:12></a> Many can say Christ is chiefest, but can you say He is everything?<a name=244:13></a> You must be outside of every human voice in order to know Him as everything.<a name=244:14></a> Blessed indeed is the moment when you are assured that He dictates to you outside and apart from all of the old man - that He is now consciously your Head.<a name=244:15></a> The effects will follow: "bowels of mercies, kindness", etc.<a name=244:16></a> There are many christians who would not accept the pope or the sovereign as the head of the church, and assert that they own Christ only as the Head, who

		There are two parts: first, our manner of life as He is our object; and secondly, what our portion is as awaiting His kingdom.<a name=247:6></a> The characteristic of those who really look for the Lord is that they are looking out for Him to reign; hence the closing character of the church is, "The Spirit and the bride say, Come".<a name=247:7></a> You get it in the parable of the wise virgins; the kingdom of heaven is likened unto ten virgins.<a name=247:8></a> The cry was, "Behold, the bridegroom", and they went forth to meet him.<a name=247:9></a> I have remarked before that you get very little in the epistles about going to heaven.<a name=247:10></a> Christians, as a rule, talk about going to heaven; and there is no doubt that we shall all go to heaven - the youngest believer.<a name=247:11></a> But you do find a great deal in the epistles about the kingdom; we overlook the kingdom too much; we overlook how we shall be on this earth

		The second part of the first trait is prayer.<a name=249:9></a> Here (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#11:1">Luke  11:1</a> - 13) the Lord gives them a prayer to suit their then condition, and there are very instructive elements in it.<a name=249:10></a> They could acknowledge that God was their Father; they could take that ground because they had seen Him in Christ, and they also looked for the kingdom.<a name=249:11></a> But it was a prayer suitable to the time when the work of the cross had not yet been accomplished, sins had not yet been put away; but I need not dwell upon this.<a name=249:12></a> Then the Lord goes on to explain what prayer is.<a name=249:13></a> He says, "Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves; for a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him?<a name=249:14></a> And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee.<a name=249:15></a> I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet

		because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth".<a name=250:1></a> Here you learn how to pray.<a name=250:2></a> The way is set forth here - that you know your friend has the thing you want, and that you do not look for it elsewhere.<a name=250:3></a> I believe that is an immense thing.<a name=250:4></a> It is sometimes the case with us all that we pray to the Lord about a certain thing, and yet we have a reserve in our minds that if one plan does not succeed we will turn to another.<a name=250:5></a> That is not prayer; prayer is that I know He has it, and that I want it, and I know that if I do not get it from Him I cannot get it elsewhere; that is, I am actually shut up to God.<a name=250:6></a> And you will find that is what the Lord continually does; He shuts you up to Himself.<a name=250:7></a> For an individual the way of prayer is ordinarily what we get in <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#4">Philippians  4</a>you make known all your requests; you may not get the answer, but you get what is a great deal better, the peace of God; though you did not pray for it you get it because you are near God.<a name=250:8></a> The Lord here (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#11">Luke  11</a>) announces that "every one that asketh receiveth"; and He winds up by saying, "How much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?<a name=250:9></a>" The Holy Spirit had not come yet, but that was the highest thing they could get.<a name=250:10></a> These - the word and prayer - are the first trait.<a name=250:11></a>

		Now I read a verse or two further in chapter 11 to show you the second trait.<a name=250:12></a> Verse 33 reads: "No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which come in may see the light.<a name=250:13></a> The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness.<a name=250:14></a> Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness.<a name=250:15></a> If thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light" - it is really 'brightness'.<a name=250:16></a> This is a

		wonderful statement; your body is to be a body of light.<a name=251:1></a> The Lord was the Light of the world, and He has gone out of it; now the point is that if your eye is single, your object is that Light.<a name=251:2></a> It is on the same principle that if you walk in the Spirit you will not fulfil the lusts of the flesh.<a name=251:3></a> A person is walking in the Spirit when Christ is the paramount object to him.<a name=251:4></a> It is not a question of having this thing or the other thing before him, it might be a good work or the like, but he has an object, and that object is the Lord Himself.<a name=251:5></a> Then the eye is single, and the effect is that the body is light; luminous is really the idea, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give its glare, its brightness.<a name=251:6></a> It is a wonderful thing, if you think of it for a moment, that in the place where my Lord was rejected I am to come out in the light of my Lord.<a name=251:7></a> The Light has gone out of this world now; He has gone, but in the very place whence the Light has gone, I look to Him, He is my object; and as the light takes possession of me, there is no part dark.<a name=251:8></a> If you had no part dark, and were completely under the rule of the light, your body would express it; I do not mean merely your dress, I mean the whole of your bearing.<a name=251:9></a> It is what is morally contrary to the darkness; people could say, That person is moving differently from everybody else here; he is separate from all the darkness around.<a name=251:10></a> It is very hard to explain, but it is a moral influence, and I have no doubt that many a one has the sense at times that there is a moral influence about another, so that you would not like to say anything to offend in that person's presence; you would feel it was unsuitable, his very presence checks it.<a name=251:11></a> What a wonderful relief to your heart to think that though the Lord has gone away, and you are here in the world where He was rejected, yet He says that if your eye is single you will be a body of light, you will not be in concert with the darkness around, but in complete antagonism, or rather contrariety to it.<a name=251:12></a> Light is a

	<div class="paragraph">
		I turn now to the hindrances; the hindrances must be removed, and therefore I must know the nature of the conflict which precedes a body of light.<a name=252:5></a> The Lord says (chapter 11: 21), "When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace: but when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils".<a name=252:6></a> The first thing you have to learn is that Satan has been turned out, and Christ has full possession; He is the 'stronger', in fact He has abolished Satan's power in that sense; He went into death that He might destroy him that had the power of death - a wonderful thing!<a name=252:7></a> Satan had power over man's body, but he has been expelled.<a name=252:8></a> Further on I may be able to show you that even his power as to infirmity is gone; the woman (chapter 13) is loosed from infirmity.<a name=252:9></a> But now I am dwelling on the fact that the actual power of possession is gone, and therefore we read in another place that your body is the Lord's: "Do ye not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit?<a name=252:10></a>" Satan's power is gone; that is one thing.<a name=252:11></a> The other is what you get in verse 27: "And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked.<a name=252:12></a> But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it".<a name=252:13></a> As has been remarked, it is not miracles, it is the word of God now; the word of God is the real power of the kingdom of God; the King is not here, but the power of the word is here.<a name=252:14></a> You might say of man's mind, That is a beautiful

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord now adds, No sign shall be given to this generation but the sign of the prophet Jonas.<a name=253:5></a> Jonas and Solomon combined to set forth Christ in a twofold aspect; one, Christ in suffering, and the other, Christ in glory; as Peter puts it, "The sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow".<a name=253:6></a> He is the One who has lain in the grave, as typified by Jonah, and He is the true Solomon.<a name=253:7></a> Then, He says, no man lights a lamp but he sets it upon a lamp-stand, an open place, that all that come in may see the light; and then if your eye is single your body is full of light.<a name=253:8></a> I trust what I have said may lead you to study this interesting scripture, and get more out of it than I can convey to you.<a name=253:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Having set forth this wonderful statement, that your body is to be light, we come to the difficulties of the way: "As he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him".<a name=253:10></a> Here is the first thing you have to contend with.<a name=253:11></a> Many a pious person can say, I desire to have Christ as my simple object, to have my whole body full of light; but now comes out the snare of Pharisaism, and that is, to make an external appearance.<a name=253:12></a> That was the case here, and there is an imitation of light in christendom in this day.<a name=253:13></a> There never was a great reality yet without an imitation, and the only way to correct an imitation is to present the reality.<a name=253:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I turn to chapter 12 in order to set forth the characteristics of the body of light.<a name=254:7></a> The first great characteristic is that you do not fear them that kill the body.<a name=254:8></a> "But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him.<a name=254:9></a> Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God?<a name=254:10></a> But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.<a name=254:11></a> Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows".<a name=254:12></a> The moment I fear God, I find out the wonderful care He has for me; what I could not number myself He numbers: "The very hairs of your head are all numbered".<a name=254:13></a> I want to keep definitely before you that if you are here where He is not, and glad to be here for Him a body of light, your first great characteristic as a body of light is that you do not fear them that kill the body.<a name=254:14></a> You see it in Stephen, and you see it in the apostle Paul.<a name=254:15></a> I have no doubt that if a person were thoroughly with the Lord, it would be easier to suffer for Him as a martyr than to endure a lingering illness.<a name=254:16></a> What a beautiful position a christian may be found in on this earth where the Lord was rejected!<a name=254:17></a> He seeks nothing from the earth, but he gets, while on the earth, from his Lord who is not here.<a name=254:18></a> Then the Lord adds that He will reward you in the kingdom:

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I just refer to verse 13, because there you get again the nature of the conflict; it will disclose to you the Jewish element.<a name=255:2></a> A man wanted the Lord to speak to his brother to divide the inheritance with him; he was looking for something on the earth, and the Lord gave him an example of a man who so prospered in earthly things, that he had to pull down his barns and build greater; but God said to him, "This night thy soul shall be required of thee".<a name=255:3></a> That only comes in as a check; and then we get the next characteristic in verses 22 - 32.<a name=255:4></a> Here the Lord, after saying to His disciples, "Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on", directs their attention to the ravens, how God feedeth them, and to the lilies, how they grow, and how God clothes the grass of the field, and adds:

		"And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind.<a name=255:5></a> For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.<a name=255:6></a> But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added unto you.<a name=255:7></a> Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom".<a name=255:8></a> As I have said, the first great characteristic is not to fear them that kill the body.<a name=255:9></a> If Christ were simply my object, I should not fear them that kill the body.<a name=255:10></a> That is what is outside of me; and the second characteristic is inside; instead of taking thought what I should eat, or what I should drink, or being of doubtful mind, I say, My Father knoweth that I have need of these things, and it is His good pleasure to give me the kingdom; and therefore the principle is, "Seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added unto you".<a name=255:11></a>

		that you are ready for service, "and your lights burning" - that is, your candles, "the light of the body is the eye"; your loins girt and your lights burning, "and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding" - that is, you are waiting for Him to come here.<a name=256:1></a> And what will happen?<a name=256:2></a> Verse 37 tells you: "Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching", etc.<a name=256:3></a>; they are serving Him now, and He will serve them then.<a name=256:4></a> Peter wants to know whether the parable is spoken to them or to all.<a name=256:5></a> "And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall make ruler over his household, to give them their portion of meat in due season?<a name=256:6></a> Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.<a name=256:7></a> Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over all that he hath".<a name=256:8></a> It has been said there are two things here, the expectation of the Lord, and service.<a name=256:9></a> I desire to press much that if you were looking for the Lord, and really expecting Him to come (and that is the meaning of watching) you would be occupied with Christ's household.<a name=256:10></a> He is not speaking here of the church dispensationally, but of His household.<a name=256:11></a> <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#24:45">Matthew  24:45</a>, 46 will make it plainer: "Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?<a name=256:12></a> Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing".<a name=256:13></a> That shows you that the characteristic of a servant watching for the Lord to come back is that he is looking after the interests of His household, giving them their meat in due season.<a name=256:14></a> In that sense it is brought out very distinctly at the close of Revelation, where we read, "The Spirit and the bride say, Come".<a name=256:15></a> Then is added, "Let him that heareth say, Come", you are not occupied with yourself, there is another range, another circle of things that you are occupied with - the circle of His interests.<a name=256:16></a> "Let him that

		Here we read "the lord commended the unjust steward", not for his unrighteousness in taking his master's property, but the instruction the Lord means to convey is that if you use the property entrusted to you in view of the future, as the unjust steward did, He will approve you.<a name=266:6></a> The Lord says, 'It is all My property, and if you use My money in that way I will approve you'.<a name=266:7></a> They were looking at the present advantage of riches; but the point is that the Lord connects it with the future; therefore the chapter finishes up with the parable of the rich man and Lazarus.<a name=266:8></a> Which was the best off in the end, the poor man or the rich man?<a name=266:9></a> "Thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things", but what is their place in the future?<a name=266:10></a> You see, beloved friends, you must take into account that you are in a place where the Lord is rejected; the Lord takes an interest in every one of us, whether poor or rich; but what He is showing here is that earthly goods are His property, and the way He would like you to use them.<a name=266:11></a> It is not that He would like you to neglect yourself and be ascetic, but the real good of the possessions is that you can make friends for the future; that is, that as you spend for the Lord and for the benefit of others what is properly His, but entrusted to you for the time being, it will be for your

		In prospect of the kingdom there is great instruction for us in seeing the characteristics of those who belong to the kingdom.<a name=269:3></a> If you turn to chapter 18 you will see that the first characteristic is that a person has nothing to say for himself.<a name=269:4></a> "He spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others".<a name=269:5></a> Two men went up to the temple to pray; the one had nothing to say for himself - that is the first characteristic; he says, "God be merciful to me a sinner".<a name=269:6></a> Then, following on that, in verse 15, "They brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them.<a name=269:7></a> But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God".<a name=269:8></a> Now, beloved friends, it is of deep importance that we should see the characteristics of those who belong to the kingdom.<a name=269:9></a> The Lord says of little children, "of such is the kingdom of God", because what characterises a little child is that it has no antecedents, nothing that it can fall back upon; it clings, and it cries.<a name=269:10></a> There is something extremely touching in the way a soul truly rests on God.<a name=269:11></a> There is dependence and confidence.<a name=269:12></a> I have no dependence in myself; I may not even know what to ask Him; but just like a child I cling and I cry, and I know that He understands.<a name=269:13></a> An infant has three or four different cries, and a mother understands the meaning of each cry.<a name=269:14></a> But I want to press on you the wonderful

		I see the history of man on the earth, opening with two men, Cain and Abel.<a name=294:5></a> Cain, like every man of sense, perceives that there is a distance between God and man, and he desires to remove the distance.<a name=294:6></a> He is what you might call a man of good human aspirations; but he thought that by the fruits of the earth he could restore relations with God.<a name=294:7></a> He did not understand the nature of the distance; he was altogether in darkness as to it.<a name=294:8></a> And here many really pious are defective; they do not understand the nature of the distance.<a name=294:9></a> Now, Abel in his offering corrects Cain; he offers of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof, a victim not chargeable with his offence bearing the judgment of it, and, at the time of bearing the judgment of it, having a personal excellency.<a name=294:10></a> That was Abel's offering; he got the fat through death; he could not have got it if the lamb had not been killed.<a name=294:11></a> But there was no resurrection there; and I refer to this on purpose, because many people find a measure of relief as to their sins from seeing that Christ died for them; but you are not justified until you see Him risen from the dead.<a name=294:12></a> All through the Old Testament salvation was not accomplished, and could not be accomplished until Christ rose: and when He rose, He had not only borne the judgment on man, but He Himself had risen out of it, and hence He originated, that is, He is the Head of, a new race.<a name=294:13></a>

		Now I turn to <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#23">Luke  23</a>in order that you may see the new place into which the Saviour introduces the believer.<a name=295:7></a> Here the Lord is between two malefactors, and one rails on Him and says, "If thou be Christ, save thyself and us".<a name=295:8></a> We have two men again; not only two men in the beginning of the world, but two men in the beginning of christianity.<a name=295:9></a> Now these two men are two sample men, illustrating the two lines that are in the world.<a name=295:10></a> One of them cannot see anything in Christ, and yet one is locally as near to Christ as the other; he could see Christ only with the natural mind, and the natural mind cannot understand the things of the Spirit of God; hence he says, "If thou be Christ, save thyself and us".<a name=295:11></a> Now look at the other; he is as much degraded as his fellow; but see how grace works in him; the light of God enters his soul.<a name=295:12></a> Light is wonderful!<a name=295:13></a> It was evidently very sudden, for in another gospel we read that he also was reviling.<a name=295:14></a> Beloved friends, light is very sudden; it is instantaneous; thank God, it is divine.<a name=295:15></a> Look at the light which shone out of heaven on Saul of Tarsus.<a name=295:16></a> That is the beginning of the work of grace.<a name=295:17></a> There are two parts of grace: one, the work which Christ has accomplished; the other, that the sinner's eyes are opened, and he is turned from darkness to light.<a name=295:18></a> This is the marvel of His grace, not only that He has removed everything against the sinner, but that He leads the sinner to know it; as we read in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#14">Luke  14</a>, "Compel them to come in".<a name=295:19></a> He compels by His

		Now it is interesting to note how "the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God?<a name=296:9></a>" He has received light, and he finds himself in the presence of God; "the fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom".<a name=296:10></a> I like to see it in a child.<a name=296:11></a> It is a good sign when the fear of God is before your eyes.<a name=296:12></a> It is often, alas!<a name=296:13></a> like the Pharisees in <a href="../bible/John.htm#8">John  8</a>; when the light shone, they went out one by one.<a name=296:14></a> Sometimes if a man is touched at a gospel preaching he will not come again for a while, though if God's light has entered he <i>will</i> come again.<a name=296:15></a> The Pharisees "went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last".<a name=296:16></a> The woman, the sinner, remained where the light was; she was blessed.<a name=296:17></a>

		Now we have seen, I trust, the nature of the judgment, which is the first subject.<a name=312:5></a> We now come to the second - how you can be saved, how the judgment has been borne.<a name=312:6></a> God in His grace saves Noah and his house.<a name=312:7></a> Here His grace is displayed; He shows that He can save, and how He does it.<a name=312:8></a> The ark figuratively sets forth the death of Christ.<a name=312:9></a> There was a moment upon the earth when no flesh could be seen; it was either drowned in the water or covered by the ark.<a name=312:10></a> The covering, the atonement, is God's way of saving the soul.<a name=312:11></a> It was a type; only a few, eight souls, were saved by water.<a name=312:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the import of this type is that they were exposed to the water, the judgment, and they were saved out of it.<a name=312:13></a> We read in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#7:11">Genesis  7:11</a>, "In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up", and in chapter 8: 13, "And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry".<a name=312:14></a> Of course, we are looking at the type at present, how those exposed to the judgment can be saved, for there is no other way in which they could be saved.<a name=312:15></a> The Lord possibly refers to it when He says, "I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me".<a name=312:16></a> There was no way of being saved but by the ark, which typified the death of Christ.<a name=312:17></a> Noah and his house were a type of the saved company.<a name=312:18></a> This type (it is most

		God sees it.<a name=316:1></a> May you realise his singular blessed position.<a name=316:2></a> Now, at verse 35 we read, "Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?<a name=316:3></a>" He does not say 'the Son of man' some commentators would read, 'the Son of man'; no, "the Son of God".<a name=316:4></a> Do you comprehend?<a name=316:5></a> Because if you do, you will be much interested.<a name=316:6></a> And he answered and said, "Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?<a name=316:7></a>" It was not simply that the work had been wrought in his soul, but he had learnt that the light of God's grace puts one outside everything of man.<a name=316:8></a> I press this because, until you understand it, you will never understand the unique position which belongs at the present moment to every one who has been relieved of the judgment of God.<a name=316:9></a> I am speaking to believers now, and I say, Do you know that all of the man under judgment, the best of him, has been so completely removed, that you are outside of all, and that outside of all you are bound in heart to Another, your Saviour, the Son of God?<a name=316:10></a> He said, Lord, who is He?<a name=316:11></a> I believe that is a blessed solitude.<a name=316:12></a> I have no doubt that it is because souls have never been in this solitude that they have not found the unexampled, the incomparable position in which a believer is placed at such a moment.<a name=316:13></a> "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?<a name=316:14></a> He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?<a name=316:15></a> And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him" - the last time he met Him he was blind; now he sees Him - "Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee".<a name=316:16></a> Now, beloved friends, bear in mind where this man who was blind is; he is clear of the darkness, and knows a new and unparalleled place when "he said, Lord, I believe.<a name=316:17></a> And he worshipped him"; his heart absorbed in delight with an object, the Son of God - outside of every man, and in seclusion with Himself.<a name=316:18></a>

		the two great traits of the good Shepherd.<a name=317:1></a> Many understand the one who do not understand the other.<a name=317:2></a> The one is, "I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep".<a name=317:3></a> He died for them; Christ gave Himself a ransom for many.<a name=317:4></a> He gave up the life to which sin could be attached.<a name=317:5></a> You could not be saved by Him, and keep the life on account of which Christ died.<a name=317:6></a> Here there is confusion in souls.<a name=317:7></a> If there were true apprehension of the work of Christ, that He so bore the judgment on man that all the man who had offended against God has been removed to God's infinite satisfaction, and that He who saved you from death is now your life, there would be a wonderful testimony to the grace of God.<a name=317:8></a> You could say, It is not merely that I shall be greatly blessed by and by, but I am unspeakably so now, in the place where once I was under the judgment of God.<a name=317:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second trait of the good Shepherd we read in verses 14, 15: "I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.<a name=317:10></a> As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep".<a name=317:11></a> "I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep".<a name=317:12></a> You are brought into the greatest intimacy with the Saviour; though you are cast out by the religious man, you receive infinitely more in acquaintance with Christ, the Son of God.<a name=317:13></a> The correct reading is, "As the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father".<a name=317:14></a> It is almost too much to say, because it may seem so incomprehensible, that the same kind of acquaintance is to subsist between Christ and the believer as between the Father and the Son.<a name=317:15></a> I can understand an earnest soul saying, Well, if that is true, I should not mind being excluded from every man.<a name=317:16></a> We often sing:

	<div class="paragraph">
		I desire much to press on you that, if any of the pressure from sin remains, your soul will be under a cloud.<a name=318:3></a> I have no doubt that this is the cause of the little happiness some believers have; they are not quite clear of the man under the judgment of God.<a name=318:4></a> The apostle can say for himself, "I am crucified with Christ", not that he should retain the old man, but in order that, being free from the man under judgment, he should be here under the control of Christ, Christ being in him.<a name=318:5></a> Hence the apostle can say, "God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world".<a name=318:6></a>

		I need not add more.<a name=318:7></a> I trust I have said enough to make it plain to you, and I will recapitulate concisely the three points I have spoken on.<a name=318:8></a> First, the weight or judgment on man, the nature of that judgment.<a name=318:9></a> It is senseless a man proposing to discharge a debt of which he knows neither the nature nor the amount.<a name=318:10></a> But, thank God, the Lord Jesus Christ knew exactly all that lay upon us; and He put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself.<a name=318:11></a> He says, "I will discharge it;" "I come to do thy will, O God".<a name=318:12></a> "Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me".<a name=318:13></a> "By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all".<a name=318:14></a> Secondly, how you are saved.<a name=318:15></a> You are saved by appropriating in faith Christ's death, figuratively set forth in the ark.<a name=318:16></a> Noah and his house went into the ark and they were saved; they were a year and ten days in the ark, signifying that in the circumstances of every day here, they were under the cover of Christ's death, excluded from man as he is, but shut in to

		Christ.<a name=319:1></a> You are saved out of the judgment, because Christ has borne it; and as you appropriate His death you are practically free from the man under judgment.<a name=319:2></a> Now, thirdly, you enter on a new history - you are in the favour of God.<a name=319:3></a> The man who was blind entered on a new history; he is not only clear of all the darkness, but he has now the most intimate acquaintance with the blessed Saviour.<a name=319:4></a> There could not be any greater favour or a happier position.<a name=319:5></a> Now this is yours; you are clear of all that was against you in the sight of God, and you are in incomparable nearness and intimacy with Jesus Christ, the Son of God.<a name=319:6></a>

		We have a very interesting type of the work of grace, "the salvation of the LORD", as it is called, in the way Israel was delivered out of Egypt.<a name=320:1></a> The judgment of God had fallen upon Egypt, so that "there was not a house where there was not one dead" - a terrible night of judgment; and as we find in chapter 12, the children of Israel were told to kill a lamb, every man according to his family, and to sprinkle the blood upon the lintel and the doorposts - figuratively the blood of Christ; and God said, "When I see the blood, I will pass over you".<a name=320:2></a> They were inside, and the blood was outside on the lintel and the doorposts, and the judgment passed over them; they were safe from the judgment.<a name=320:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One can be thankful that there are many who believe that the blood of Christ is before the eye of God; it is a good beginning, a good start, but not all.<a name=320:4></a> It is an immense gain to believe that the blood of Christ is before the eye of God, and that because of that blood-shedding, He passes by.<a name=320:5></a> A familiar phrase quite conveys it: 'I know I shall not be lost'.<a name=320:6></a> That is all; you cannot go further.<a name=320:7></a> So with Israel; they were inside, and they were safe from the judgment, but they were not happy.<a name=320:8></a> They were very like a drowning man, rescued by a lifeboat, but still in the storm, on the rough sea - figuratively not out of the place of judgment.<a name=320:9></a> The gospel is that not only are you passed over, but that you are delivered from the judgment.<a name=320:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two things of great importance to bear in mind: one is, that God made the way through the sea; and the other is, that the light which showed the way was God's light.<a name=322:9></a> Christ has made the way through death - the judgment of God.<a name=322:10></a> He died; He has borne the judgment, and He has been "raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father".<a name=322:11></a> I want you to accept that the Israelites did walk this new path through the sea; and every one who walked it knew that he had found the way out of it; as in <a href="../bible/John.htm#5:24">John  5:24</a>, he had "passed out of death into life".<a name=322:12></a> Every one is involved in the judgment.<a name=322:13></a> You cannot get out of it except through the death and resurrection of Christ.<a name=322:14></a> He has opened a way out of death, He is "declared to be the Son of God with power .<a name=322:15></a>.<a name=322:16></a>.<a name=322:17></a> by the resurrection from the dead".<a name=322:18></a> There is no one who with the eye of faith beholds the Lord risen, but sees there is a Man who has come out of all that was against me; He was raised out from among the dead.<a name=322:19></a> "If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt

		believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved".<a name=323:1></a> Think for a moment, it is very simple; one Man has risen out from among the dead, and He has broken all the power of Satan.<a name=323:2></a> Satan tried to terrify Him in the garden of Gethsemane, so that He said, "This is your hour, and the power of darkness".<a name=323:3></a> He went down into death, and bore the sinner's judgment; He so glorified God that He "was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father".<a name=323:4></a> I am speaking now of the antitype; but the type shows us the beautiful way all was done.<a name=323:5></a> There were two things of deepest interest: one, that the way was made through the sea; and the other, that the light from God showed them the way.<a name=323:6></a> They saw the sea on the right hand and on the left - the judgment which they incurred - but they were saved out of it, while Pharaoh and all his host were drowned in the Red Sea.<a name=323:7></a> "The Egyptians whom ye have seen today, ye shall see them again no more for ever".<a name=323:8></a> It is a type that both Satan, and the flesh which Satan can act on, are gone in judgment.<a name=323:9></a> I can understand a simple soul saying, Well, if I could see that, and know that all against me was gone in judgment in the eye of God, I should be perfectly happy.<a name=323:10></a> It is not merely that the blood of Christ was offered, but that He went under the judgment, that He broke the power of the devil, and judicially terminated the man under judgment; as we read in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>(mark the words), "Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil".<a name=323:11></a> I ask every one in this room, Do you really believe the power of the devil is broken, and that Christ has abolished death?<a name=323:12></a> It is not the power of death only, but that "he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage".<a name=323:13></a> All the

		It is of great importance that you should understand the type.<a name=324:2></a> Israel went into the sea, figuratively the judgment of God, and they found that there was a way made for them through it.<a name=324:3></a> "The waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left".<a name=324:4></a> They walked through the sea, and when the morning appeared they were saved, and the waters covered their enemies.<a name=324:5></a> The death of Christ is the judgment of this world; as the Lord said, "Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out".<a name=324:6></a> All Israel walked through the Red Sea; they did not only hear of it, but they walked every step of the way; they appropriated practically for themselves the work which was done for them.<a name=324:7></a> Step by step they appropriated the salvation of God; and where they were saved, their enemies were swallowed up.<a name=324:8></a> Hence the song in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15">Exodus  15</a>"I will sing unto the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea".<a name=324:9></a> The power of the devil is destroyed.<a name=324:10></a> Though the devil is still here, his power as Pharaoh is gone for the believer.<a name=324:11></a> Christ has abolished death.<a name=324:12></a> I do not say that you have by faith laid hold of this great fact.<a name=324:13></a> You may believe in the blood of Christ before the eye of God, but you may not have seen by faith that all which was under judgment has been set aside in judgment.<a name=324:14></a> Israel was implicated in the judgment because of the Egyptians, and now they are gone in judgment, while Israel was led safely through by the Lord.<a name=324:15></a> Hence it is no work of their own, but they sing, "The LORD .<a name=324:16></a>.<a name=324:17></a>.<a name=324:18></a> hath triumphed gloriously".<a name=324:19></a>

		In <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15">Luke  15</a>you will see this explained.<a name=331:1></a> In Exodus Israel was to be brought out of one place into an infinitely better place.<a name=331:2></a> If I were addressing a young man, full of aspirations in this world, I should say, I offer you infinitely more than all you seek here, and at this moment.<a name=331:3></a> You have to learn that it is not merely a future blessing, but a present one.<a name=331:4></a> Hence we read, "Where sin abounded, grace did much more abound".<a name=331:5></a> There are christians who could not explain this passage; they know that their sins are forgiven, but they do not understand that "where sin abounded, grace did much more abound".<a name=331:6></a> The much more abounding is unknown in the righteous government of the world; when a man commits an offence, he incurs the penalty of the law; and when the penalty is paid he is set free.<a name=331:7></a> If in prison for a debt, and a friend pays his debt, he is discharged; his debt was paid through grace, but there is no abounding there.<a name=331:8></a> It is, of course, a great thing to be free of debt.<a name=331:9></a> But there is not only forgiveness with God; God has laid help on One that is mighty; His own arm hath brought salvation to Him.<a name=331:10></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>Christ says to the woman of Samaria, "If thou knewest the gift of God".<a name=331:11></a> God has come out in quite a new way, so that "where sin abounded, grace did much more abound".<a name=331:12></a> The man saved by grace is infinitely better off than man was before he had sinned.<a name=331:13></a> I am pressing the wonderful greatness of the love of God, so that He can say, 'All in you contrary to Me has been removed, to My infinite satisfaction, in the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ; and now My heart is at liberty to do as I please for you'.<a name=331:14></a> This is the gospel of the blessed God, and therefore your new state bears no comparison with the old.<a name=331:15></a> There is no comparison between Canaan and Egypt.<a name=331:16></a> You read in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#11">Deuteronomy  11</a>of the contrast between them.<a name=331:17></a> In Egypt there was no rain, but when the overflow of the river came, they had to conduct the water to the roots of the trees.<a name=331:18></a> "For the land, whither thou goest

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now mark, the first impression the prodigal got on coming to his father was the tenderness of his love.<a name=335:7></a> I lay great stress on this, because the lack in many is that they do not believe it.<a name=335:8></a> Here is verified, "God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself"; and hence when known, "We also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the reconciliation" - not "the atonement".<a name=335:9></a> God Himself has effected it, and therefore He can greet the returning prodigal in the most loving way.<a name=335:10></a> The prodigal at the same time has a deeper sense of unfitness; that is repentance.<a name=335:11></a> "But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet" - that is, he is made meet, "accepted in the beloved".<a name=335:12></a>

		The prodigal is given an infinitely higher position than the one he had lost.<a name=335:13></a> Because God has been glorified by Christ in the work He has done, God can now do more for us than if we had never sinned at all; He can satisfy His heart, so that "where sin abounded, grace did much more abound".<a name=335:14></a> The moment the prodigal was fit for his father's house he was in it.<a name=335:15></a> The word now is, "Bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry".<a name=335:16></a> The meaning is that the believer shares in heavenly festivity.<a name=335:17></a> You may admit that Canaan is superior to Egypt, but here

		I desire to bring before you this evening the greatness of the blessing vouchsafed to the believer in Christ on the earth; the greatness of the gift of God, I do not say <i>from</i> the earth, but <i>on</i> the earth.<a name=338:1></a> It is not merely that all that which was against you has been removed in the cross, that Christ "hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God", but it is the blessing you receive on coming to God.<a name=338:2></a> If it were better known, or rather enjoyed, there would be a wonderful testimony to the grace, even apart from preaching; great would be the testimony of the one who really knew the gift of God - his present portion on the earth, not one which he is expecting, but one which he is enjoying; as our Lord said to the woman of Samaria, "If thou knewest the gift of God", or God as a giver.<a name=338:3></a> I read about the widow of Sarepta, because the Lord alludes to this case in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4">Luke  4</a>when He was rejected by the Jews, He refers to the gentile widow and to the gentile leper.<a name=338:4></a> The tale told us here is very interesting.<a name=338:5></a> There was a great famine in the land, and Elijah was sent by the Lord to be sustained by a widow in Sarepta.<a name=338:6></a> When he came to the city, he saw a woman gathering sticks, and he asked her for a little water.<a name=338:7></a> As she was going to fetch it, he asked her to bring him a morsel of bread, and she said she had not any, she had only a little oil in a cruse and a little meal in a barrel, and she was gathering a couple of sticks, that she might bake a cake, eat it, and die.<a name=338:8></a> Can you conceive anything more deplorable?<a name=338:9></a> It is a true picture of the natural man; he is looking for present enjoyment, but beyond the present he knows nothing.<a name=338:10></a> She is deliberately bent on enjoying her last meal; after that, death - she had no more.<a name=338:11></a>

		In the opening of John's gospel you find that Christ was to effect two great works: one, "the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world"; and the other, "<i>he</i> it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit".<a name=339:17></a> It is important to connect them together.<a name=339:18></a> In the one He removes all that is contrary to God, and in the other He fits us for all that is according to God.<a name=339:19></a> On previous evenings I have dwelt on how He removes all that is contrary to God; I desire now to dwell on the greatness of His gift.<a name=339:20></a> It is of the last importance that

		The woman of Samaria cannot understand His grace, but says, "How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria?<a name=340:11></a> for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.<a name=340:12></a> Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water".<a name=340:13></a> His asking her for a drink might have inspired her with confidence to ask Him.<a name=340:14></a> If you ask me to do anything for you, you embolden me to ask you to do something for me.<a name=340:15></a> If she had asked of Him, He would have given her living water.<a name=340:16></a>

		In verse 14 the Lord tells her, "Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst" (the word for "never" is the strongest word that can be used; it means, neither here nor hereafter); "but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life".<a name=341:8></a> That is, death has been removed, and you are brought into life in the Spirit of God.<a name=341:9></a> The widow of Sarepta saw death overcome; but the believer has a divine fountain within him springing up into eternal life.<a name=341:10></a> The woman was attracted by this great gift; she could not be otherwise.<a name=341:11></a> I would say to any one much attracted by the things of the world, I can tell you of a present benefit, far superior to the brightest gain in this world.<a name=341:12></a> If you could acquire the brightest and greatest benefit here, you must part with it some day, and however great it was you would like to add to it, you could not be satisfied.<a name=341:13></a> But here you are told that the gift of grace is so great that you shall never have a sense of deficiency; you will be in the region of satisfied desire, because it shall be in you; it is not from anything outside of you: "the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life".<a name=341:14></a> I believe the more you read and the more you

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is the natural man who is before us in chapter 2, both in relation to man and in relation to God, but the contrast is here; the new state is declared.<a name=343:3></a> The Lord is setting forth the grace of God, the greatness of His gift.<a name=343:4></a> If He had spoken to the woman of the law, she would have been familiar with the subject.<a name=343:5></a> Here the Lord speaks of God giving, the very opposite of demanding.<a name=343:6></a> God is come out in a new way.<a name=343:7></a> Law is a righteous demand; grace comes to give to the undeserving.<a name=343:8></a> "If thou knewest the gift of God".<a name=343:9></a> No one could have apprehended the greatness of the gift, that it should be in him, not like the wine, outside of himself; and that instead of running out, it should be "in him a fountain of water, springing up into eternal life".<a name=343:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next, let us look at the nature of the gift; it is the Spirit of God.<a name=343:11></a> The Spirit of God is given to every believer in Christ, "In whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise".<a name=343:12></a> Therefore the apostle says to the Corinthians, "Do ye not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which ye have of God; and ye are not your own?<a name=343:13></a>" We do not dwell sufficiently on the simple fact that we have received the Holy Spirit.<a name=343:14></a> If you have not received the Holy Spirit, you have not believed on Christ personally.<a name=343:15></a> In that sense you have not come to Him.<a name=343:16></a> I do not say you have not faith in His work; but as in the case of the ten lepers (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#17">Luke  17</a>) all were cleansed, but nine of them went to ritualism to find approach to God.<a name=343:17></a> Many converted are here.<a name=343:18></a> Only one of the lepers came direct to Christ; he had now a living link with Him; this in pattern is sealing by the Holy Spirit.<a name=343:19></a> Not only has Christ saved you, but you are of Him.<a name=343:20></a> "If any man have not the

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I add a word to those who have tasted this gift of God.<a name=344:14></a> The only way to increase your enjoyment of Him is to be in continued deference to Him.<a name=344:15></a> If you live in the Spirit, walk in the Spirit.<a name=344:16></a> If there was a room in your house where you would have untold joys, but because of your business you could not be always in that room, yet whenever you had a spare moment, I am sure you would go there.<a name=344:17></a> Well, how much more should you walk in the Spirit, so that you should never thirst, for there is in you a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life.<a name=344:18></a> You may have business and many duties, but the more thoroughly you do your

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I could not exaggerate this grace.<a name=345:5></a> It is surely marvellous that God has not only effected the greatest work, the work of our salvation, but He has given you the greatest gift which you are to enjoy now on earth.<a name=345:6></a> If we were more cast upon the Lord as indispensable to us, we should receive more.<a name=345:7></a> You should ever be able to say, "Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over".<a name=345:8></a> We are very often counting up our mercies, the different ways God deals with us, and we say, Well, we are happy.<a name=345:9></a> There is a great deal more for us.<a name=345:10></a> "Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased".<a name=345:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord grant in His infinite goodness that every heart may be impressed with the sense of His wonderful grace, so that in this poor world a man may know that he possesses divine resources in himself, and therefore be able practically to say, Never less alone than when alone.<a name=345:12></a> I do not want any one to be a recluse or an ascetic, but I want you to apprehend the immensity of the gift which you have received, as well as to know the greatness of the work of salvation.<a name=345:13></a> In fact the order in John's gospel is, first the gift of grace, and then, from chapter 8, the work of grace.<a name=345:14></a> When we think of ourselves, we begin with the work; but when we look at God, He presents first the greatness of His gift.<a name=345:15></a> Have you resources?<a name=345:16></a> They are not outside of you, but you have to appreciate them, you have to draw from them; if you have a fountain of water you have to drink of it; and it is as you drink of the water that you shall never thirst.<a name=345:17></a> The Spirit assures you

		I have referred to this in speaking of Saul of Tarsus; he had seen the light out of heaven, and had heard the voice, but he was three days "and neither did eat nor drink"; he was engrossed with the Lord, he was learning the way out of his distance from God, and he found it in the death of Christ; he did get out of it, for he prayed.<a name=349:2></a> Some say, 'But we pray'.<a name=349:3></a> Yes, I know you pray, but it is to be kept in fresh remembrance of Christ's work and not of Himself.<a name=349:4></a> Joseph's brethren never knew the heart of their brother; they knew that he was their brother, and that there never was a better one; but still, though they could say this, they did not know the love which Joseph had for them.<a name=349:5></a> And so it is with many - they do not know the love of Christ.<a name=349:6></a> You may know His work, all He did for you, and not know the love in His heart to render you the greatest service; but you will never be restful until you do.<a name=349:7></a> When you do, you are disclosed to yourself in your true colour, while Christ in His grace and love is assured to you.<a name=349:8></a> And when His love is perfected to you, it is more than you can comprehend.<a name=349:9></a> It "passeth knowledge".<a name=349:10></a> Our translators did not catch the right idea in <a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:17">1 John  4:17</a>: "Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world".<a name=349:11></a> This means that the love of God is expressed and made known to you; a ray of His own feeling about you and the brightness of it has entered your soul and has so affected you that you have "boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world".<a name=349:12></a> God has but one standard - His own Son; as He is up there in the glory, so are you now in this world.<a name=349:13></a> You may say it is too great; but that is the meaning of the scripture.<a name=349:14></a> When God's love shines perfectly into your soul, you have this sense of boldness in the day of judgment; consequently we read,
