		THE CONFLICTS OF CANAAN

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Two things are very evident in this scripture first that the apostle had a great conflict; and second, what that conflict was for.<a name=1:1></a> As the servant of God, Paul was answering to the mind of the Master, he was in conflict to meet the mind of the Master about the saints.<a name=1:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was no easy thing; he would not have great conflict (agony) for a trifle.<a name=1:3></a> He was in prison, and His heart went out to them -- what for?<a name=1:4></a> See verse 2 - that they might have "the full assurance of understanding" in the mystery of God.<a name=1:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Note verse 4 -- "<i>This</i> I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words".<a name=1:6></a> There was no safety except in reaching this topmost point -- there is no safety save in being where the heart of Christ has set you.<a name=1:7></a> In Hebrews you go from earth to heaven; here you go from man to Christ, "in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge".<a name=1:8></a> "In vain the net is spread in the sight of anything which hath wings".<a name=1:9></a> If you are in Christ above, you are above the claims of things here that are snares.<a name=1:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Are saints' hearts comforted (verse 2) practically?<a name=1:11></a> They are sure of salvation, but the heart is never comforted until it lays hold of the <i>Person</i> of Christ.<a name=1:12></a> In any dispensation, whatever God gave, the great thing was to maintain the top; the highest point was the place of safety, and to forsake it was ruin - Satan always tries to take from us the best bit of truth.<a name=1:13></a> Now what are we set for?<a name=1:14></a> We have heard of the ruin, but have we lost Christ?<a name=1:15></a> Note two or three ways in which failure set in.<a name=1:16></a>

		There ought to be progress, always adding, as Peter says (<a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#1:5">2 Peter  1:5</a>).<a name=2:9></a> People are satisfied to get among the brethren, and yet when there, instead of progress there is declension.<a name=2:10></a> At deathbeds, too, I find people resigned, and not a full and abundant entrance.<a name=2:11></a>

		You must get your relationship to Christ as the first thing.<a name=2:14></a> In Revelation John shows us the bride, but she went up to heaven to be dressed -- a bride adorned for her husband.<a name=2:15></a> See, too, the series of <a href="../bible/Psalms.htm#120">Psalms  120</a>- 134, verse 2.<a name=2:16></a> They are songs of degrees or steps, progressing until we get to standing in the house.<a name=2:17></a> God always had a house, but there is another thing -- the body of Christ -- that must be the ultimate of my heart.<a name=2:18></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#120">Psalm  120</a>I get away from the tents of Kedar.<a name=2:19></a>

		When man first encountered God after the fall, he said, "I was afraid .<a name=5:1></a>.<a name=5:2></a>.<a name=5:3></a> and I hid myself".<a name=5:4></a> Now for the believer the place of the greatest fear is the place where I am most at home.<a name=5:5></a> We are as much out of judgment as Jesus is on the throne of God -- "As he is, so are we in this world"; "He that feareth is not made perfect in love".<a name=5:6></a> We cannot be in the presence of God in innocence, for we are guilty, so that we must be there in righteousness, and more at home there than anywhere else, and that place which used to repel now forms me into a likeness of itself.<a name=5:7></a> I am not tolerated there, I am at home, and where the distance was, there is now nearness and attraction.<a name=5:8></a>

		REJOICING IN THE LORD, AND THE PEACE OF GOD

		<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3">Philippians  3</a>and 4
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The epistle to the Philippians is to the saints in general what the epistle to Timothy is to the servant.<a name=58:1></a> The apostle has not been delivered out of prison, and his voice from the prison tells us to "Rejoice in the Lord".<a name=58:2></a> There is nothing here on earth to rejoice in; but that is what people are very slow to learn.<a name=58:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now one of these chapters is in relation to yourselves; the other in relation to things around you.<a name=58:4></a> Some may say, It is not my state that depresses me, it is the things around me.<a name=58:5></a> Well, the third chapter treats of your state; the fourth of your circumstances.<a name=58:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are three things I must notice in the first of these chapters.<a name=58:7></a> First, Christ is the <i>object</i>, second, He is the mark, and third, He is the <i>hope</i> of the saint.<a name=58:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle begins with a warning, "Beware of the concision".<a name=58:9></a> The concision are those who try to correct themselves; and they stand lower in the sight of God than even the self-indulgent.<a name=58:10></a> The apostle writes much more severely to the Galatians, who tried to mend the flesh, than to the Corinthians, who indulged it.<a name=58:11></a> The great attempt of the present day is to christianise man; but God's way in Scripture is to make man a christian.<a name=58:12></a> The attempt to christianise man is all wrong.<a name=58:13></a> A christian is a man of an entirely new stock and a new lineage; he is of Christ, who is the <i>beginning</i> of all.<a name=58:14></a> Hence, in the third chapter of Revelation, He is spoken of as "The beginning of the creation of God".<a name=58:15></a> There was the Laodicean church boasting

	<div class="paragraph">
		itself that it was rich and increased with goods, and had need of nothing, and knew not that it was wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.<a name=59:1></a> And what was to come in to correct such a state of things?<a name=59:2></a> Why, "the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the <i>beginning</i> of the creation of God".<a name=59:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then he says, "We are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God, and <i>boast</i> in Christ Jesus", -- not "<i>rejoice</i>", it is a stronger word than "rejoice", -- "and do not trust in flesh;" that is, the flesh is practically set aside.<a name=59:4></a> This is what you must start with.<a name=59:5></a> The thing that was insisted on as soon as ever the people of Israel got into the land, -- the first thing, as you may remember, -- was, that they were to be circumcised; and that was to set forth this fact, that in heaven we have no will of our own.<a name=59:6></a> Abraham brought in Ishmael by his own will; and the rite of circumcision was to show that he altogether ignored the flesh that had brought him in.<a name=59:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in the following verses (4 - 6), we have the good state of man, -- human righteousness, everything that is good in itself, -- and we find this: that man, not only in his bad state, but in his good state, has no sympathy with God; so that the apostle ends by taking God's side against himself, and saying, "I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ".<a name=59:8></a> Christ is the object, and what I seek is, "that I may gain Christ".<a name=59:9></a> The apostle says in the first chapter.<a name=59:10></a> "Having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better", and "to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain".<a name=59:11></a> The gain would be to be with Christ: it would be gain to him if he were to die.<a name=59:12></a> Rut here, in the third chapter, he shows what it is

	<div class="paragraph">
		that leads him to this, -- even that <i>Christ</i> is his <i>object</i>.<a name=60:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now it is a great moment to the soul when Christ first becomes your object; it is then that you can count all things but loss for His excellency, so that He may be your gain.<a name=60:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But many persons ask the question, How can I have Him in such a distinct way that I may know Him as my object?<a name=60:3></a> Well, there are two ways.<a name=60:4></a> When Jonathan saw David with the head of Goliath in his hand, and knew that he had delivered him -- brought relief to him, -- he loved him as his own soul.<a name=60:5></a> He stripped himself of his robe, and his garment, and his sword, and his bow, and his girdle, and put them on David.<a name=60:6></a> It might have been said, What an improper thing for the king's son to do!<a name=60:7></a> But Jonathan cared not for that.<a name=60:8></a> His heart was won by David because of what he had <i>done</i> for him, and he loved him as his own soul.<a name=60:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is another kind of devotedness, of which I will also give an example in the Old Testament which will make it clear to you.<a name=60:10></a> Ruth says to Naomi, "Whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge; thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God".<a name=60:11></a> This is a deeper thing.<a name=60:12></a> It sets forth one to whom the Lord becomes the object of the heart for what He <i>is</i>, not only for what He has <i>done</i>.<a name=60:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now you will find that saints rarely arrive at the second of these, though every true-hearted saint knows something of the first.<a name=60:14></a> You may know Christ as your relief, but it is quite another thing to know Him as your resource.<a name=60:15></a> It is one thing to know Him as the One who has relieved you from every pressure; it is another thing to know Him as the one attraction of your heart.<a name=60:16></a> If I know Him thus, I ascend as a balloon with not a string left to tie me to earth.<a name=60:17></a> All my links <i>were</i> to earth, but now I have
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=61>[Page 61]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Him, not only as my relief from the death on myself, but as my resource from the death and ruin on everything around me.<a name=61:1></a> I will try to explain the difference.<a name=61:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I might say to Jonathan, Do you know David?<a name=61:3></a> No, he says, I do not know him, but I love him; he has relieved me from the dreadful pressure that was upon me.<a name=61:4></a> I love him as my own soul.<a name=61:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I say to Ruth, Do you know Naomi?<a name=61:6></a> Yes, she says, I <i>know</i> her, and I <i>love</i> her too.<a name=61:7></a> I say to her, "Whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God".<a name=61:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this is an example of a heart not only attracted by what a person has <i>done</i>, but by what he <i>is</i>.<a name=61:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are four stages in a soul which is led to this happy, practical association with Christ.<a name=61:10></a> In the case of the widow of Sarepta there was first relief from the pressure that was upon her and her son; the barrel of meal did not waste; neither did the cruse of oil fail; it supplied all their need for a whole year.<a name=61:11></a> But, though it did not waste, neither did it increase.<a name=61:12></a> Then, at the end of the year, death comes in.<a name=61:13></a> The prophet takes the death upon himself, -- bears the child up to his own room, and from thence delivers him alive to his mother, and he becomes the solitary witness that the power of death was broken.<a name=61:14></a> <i>Then</i> she says, and not till <i>then</i>, "<i>Now</i> by this I know that thou art a man of God".<a name=61:15></a> She had learnt so far, even that there was power over death.<a name=61:16></a> <i>We</i> have more; we have eternal <i>life</i>, and the witnesses to us of it are the Spirit, and the water, and the blood.<a name=61:17></a> I have not only got power over death, but there are witnesses to me that I have eternal life.<a name=61:18></a> I have first relief from death, and secondly, I have eternal life.<a name=61:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next thing I find is that there is death on all
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=62>[Page 62]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		around me.<a name=62:1></a> Jonah finds, when he gets out of the depths of the sea, that there is death all around him; his gourd withers.<a name=62:2></a> Where then does the heart find comfort?<a name=62:3></a> Where did Mary of Bethany find comfort, when every light was, as it were, gone out?<a name=62:4></a> It was then, as she trod that solitary path to the grave, that she found that He walked beside her, -- not only as a relief to her, but a resource.<a name=62:5></a> And, fourthly, in the next chapter, she takes the costly ointment, and anoints the Lord with it.<a name=62:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Is it thus with you, or have you a hundred other things to delight in beside Christ?<a name=62:7></a> Paul might have had attractions down here to bind him to earth.<a name=62:8></a> But would he stay here?<a name=62:9></a> Yes, he says, I would stay for the church, but not for myself.<a name=62:10></a> "To depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better" for me.<a name=62:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If I look at the Lord I ought to be able to say, "Come"; because I answer to the wish of His heart, but, if I look at the earth, I have nothing to tie me down here, and then my wish is to <i>depart</i> to be with Him, How was it that Hezekiah, when he had to face death, said, "Like a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter"?<a name=62:12></a> It was just because he had all his links to earth.<a name=62:13></a> The apostle was quite different; he had nothing to detain him here.<a name=62:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ is not only my relief, but He is my resource.<a name=62:15></a> If I have nothing down here but a dreary waste before my heart I can say, He has relieved my conscience, He has satisfied my heart.<a name=62:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you have not Christ thus as your object, you cannot count all things but loss for the excellency of His knowledge; but if you have, when you get up in the morning, your thought is not, I hope I shall behave myself well today; but, I have to live Christ today.<a name=62:17></a> You ought to begin your day with this confidence that you have enough in Christ to meet every difficulty that may befall you, just as you know that you will have light enough to do your work by;

	<div class="paragraph">
		If you do not know this you are not enjoying eternal life.<a name=63:2></a> I have a new condition altogether.<a name=63:3></a> I am in a region where I can enjoy God, and the proof of it is that death is not on me only, but it is also on all around me.<a name=63:4></a> Have you ever seen the world a bleak barren desert, and you yourself left alone in it like a solitary tree?<a name=63:5></a> And could you then say, Well, there is One who sits on the throne, and He is enough for me, though all else has withered?<a name=63:6></a> I make Him my object; and as I cannot yet depart to be with Him, I shall try so to win Him while I am on the earth that I may be as truly with Him in spirit, and as truly see Him by faith, as if I were gone to Him.<a name=63:7></a> When we see a man without an object in life we say he is an aimless man.<a name=63:8></a> Now here is a man with a purpose, with an object: "that I may <i>win Christ</i>", and "that I may <i>know him</i>, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death".<a name=63:9></a>

		And now comes another thing.<a name=63:10></a> It is not only that he has an object, but he has a mark.<a name=63:11></a> It is not only that I know what He has done and what He is, but I must be in association with Christ where Christ is.<a name=63:12></a> Then it is that I come to understand what the mark is.<a name=63:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The mark is what gives steadiness to the walk.<a name=63:14></a> If a man is a stranger he shows by his behaviour that he is strange <i>in</i> the place; if he is a pilgrim he shows by his behaviour that he is going <i>to</i> a place.<a name=63:15></a> Now Paul says: I am going on my way to do a service; I have started from a place, I am going on a circuit, and I shall come back to that same place again after I have done my work.<a name=63:16></a> I do not expect to grow old here; if I look forward I see

	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle brings these things before them so that they may be able to rejoice always.<a name=64:8></a> I find that if there is one thing that marks the saints in general, it is absence of joy in the Lord.<a name=64:9></a> How can you get joy in the Lord?<a name=64:10></a> By making use of Him.<a name=64:11></a> You will never know the value of Christ until you use Him.<a name=64:12></a> The Lord likes you to use Him, He says "Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee", and "casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you".<a name=64:13></a> I find when I sit down with people quietly to have a talk that they begin at once to speak of the trials of the way!<a name=64:14></a> And after that, if I say, Suppose we change the subject and talk of the things of God; -- then I find that they can talk of nothing but the <i>mercies</i> of God to themselves, but it is all the <i>temporal</i> mercies of God they talk of.<a name=64:15></a> And they get no higher than this.<a name=64:16></a> How few can say, The Lord has shown me wonderful things lately about the Lord Jesus Christ!<a name=64:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Lastly as to our hope.<a name=64:18></a> "We look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ".<a name=64:19></a> This is what we are looking for; we have no country but heaven, and we are looking for the Lord to come and take us to it.<a name=64:20></a> And when He comes forth the first thing He will do will be to raise the bodies of His sleeping saints; He will raise them in likeness to His glorious body; and as to us, He will also "change our vile body, that it

		Well, so far, it is all about myself, but what about circumstances outside?<a name=65:4></a> Now we come to them; and the first thing is, "let your moderation be known unto all men".<a name=65:5></a> A man jostles you in the streets: let him.<a name=65:6></a> "The Lord is at hand".<a name=65:7></a> You can "be careful for nothing; but in everything by prayer and supplication <i>with thanksgiving</i>" -- do not forget past mercies.<a name=65:8></a> Is my child sick?<a name=65:9></a> I remember how one was before, and how God succoured me then, Keep up the recollection of His goodness; there is nothing so good for the soul as to keep up the remembrance of the goodness of God.<a name=65:10></a> "With thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.<a name=65:11></a> And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus".<a name=65:12></a> All your requests are to be made known.<a name=65:13></a> What!<a name=65:14></a> pray about <i>every</i> thing?<a name=65:15></a> Yes.<a name=65:16></a> I am sure the saints would not have half the foolish things they have in their houses if they made all their requests known to God, Make known <i>everything</i> to Him.<a name=65:17></a>

		In public, as well as private, we are often troubled with the thought as to whether we are expressing God's will.<a name=65:18></a> Now the first question is, Have you been to God about it?<a name=65:19></a> And, having been, do you know that God's ear has taken in what you have requested?<a name=65:20></a> The moment that you have got the sense that He has heard you, you are satisfied; you want no more, and need not repeat it; just as a man says to his child, -- You have talked to me about that before.<a name=65:21></a>

		The two great subjects which come out at the end of the chapter I have read are, the one, the rock on which Christ builds the church -- that is His own Person; and, the other, the cross.<a name=68:1></a> These two things must go together, and I desire to dwell upon what will prepare you to understand them; looking however at the cross, not as connected with our sins, but as that which separates us from the man that is here, and from the things that are here.<a name=68:2></a>

		You have to learn the cross as that which has separated you from things here; you have to find out what Jesus is when there is nothing else but Jesus, or, as this scripture teaches it in figure, when there is "<i>no bread</i>".<a name=68:6></a> The Lord says, Do not look for a sign.<a name=68:7></a> The leaven of the Pharisees was looking for a sign; but Jesus is to be sufficient for you when there is nothing but Himself, when there is nothing to supply you naturally.<a name=68:8></a> The natural is what man looks for; but what Christ would here teach His disciples is that it is not for what is natural they are to look, but for Himself.<a name=68:9></a>

		Bread is what suits nature.<a name=69:2></a> After forty years' wandering in the wilderness Israel learned, "man doth not live by bread only".<a name=69:3></a> God's purpose is to teach me this lesson, and He does so in various ways: not only by leading me through sorrow; He gives me bright days as well as dark ones.<a name=69:4></a> But though there are dark ones, I wish to correct an idea that often troubles people, namely, that God always wants to bring us <i>down</i> when He chastens us.<a name=69:5></a> When He corrects a man it is not that He may bring him down, but that He may lift him <i>up</i>.<a name=69:6></a> He says, "Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may <i>exalt</i> you in due time".<a name=69:7></a> I discipline my child in order that I may exalt him morally.<a name=69:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord says, "Man shall not live by bread alone".<a name=69:9></a> That is what I have to start with.<a name=69:10></a> Here is the blessed Son of God led into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil, and when He has fasted forty days and forty nights He hungered.<a name=69:11></a> He has no bread.<a name=69:12></a> Is it wrong to be hungry?<a name=69:13></a> Of course it is not.<a name=69:14></a> But what does the Lord say when the devil comes and says to Him, "If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread".<a name=69:15></a>?<a name=69:16></a> He says, I have got no instruction from God to make bread.<a name=69:17></a> What a marvellous sight!<a name=69:18></a> There is the Son of God, that made the heavens and the earth -- there He is, hungry, in the very nature and make that He Himself created; He is hungry, and He will not stir His hand to provide bread for Himself!<a name=69:19></a>

		I just turn to that passage in Peter to which I referred.<a name=69:20></a> He says, "Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time".<a name=69:21></a> Then, "Casting all your care

		But besides this there is the devil.<a name=70:4></a> "Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour".<a name=70:5></a> Here I get a double character of evil: care inside and the devil outside.<a name=70:6></a> As to the care, you are relieved from it when you can say, I am so little that I cannot help myself, so I just cast it upon One who can help me, as in the case of the widow with the adversary.<a name=70:7></a> I am then a humble person, because I cast my care upon One who can care for me.<a name=70:8></a> But this lowly weak person has besides a most terrible enemy; and where does this enemy show himself?<a name=70:9></a> Perhaps in your next-door neighbour, who will try to carry you off to a flower show; perhaps in another, who will come in to talk to a mother about her children, or to a man about his business.<a name=70:10></a> "Whom resist stedfast in the faith"; and the more sense you have of your own weakness as you resist him, the greater the sense you will have of the power of God.<a name=70:11></a> You never learn power but in weakness, and the measure of the strait you go through with God is the measure of your strength.<a name=70:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Oh!<a name=70:13></a> it is the distraction of the soul that so hinders, -- the looking for something else to relieve it in the strait instead of Jesus; so that it is unprepared for a place where there is only Himself.<a name=70:14></a> Our place is in the holiest, and what is there there save Jesus?<a name=70:15></a> What does Paul find when he gets into the third heaven?<a name=70:16></a> Not one bit of bread there; nothing to keep up nature.<a name=70:17></a> He did not even know whether he was in the body or not, so little was there to minister to it there.<a name=70:18></a>

		Let me say a word upon enjoyment, for I think people confuse in their minds the difference between enjoyment and strength, and thus after a season of enjoyment are much surprised to find that they want strength.<a name=72:3></a> Paul found this.<a name=72:4></a> After being in the third heavens he had to say, "When I am weak, then am I strong", and to learn, "My strength is made perfect in weakness", so that he could say.<a name=72:5></a> "Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong".<a name=72:6></a> No man in life could make sense of this unless he knew that it is in straits that you learn what Christ is.<a name=72:7></a> Do you like to get into a strait to learn something of Christ?<a name=72:8></a> We are glad enough when it is over to see what we have learned in it; but do I say when going into it, Well, now I shall learn in this sorrow what a resource Christ is?<a name=72:9></a> I hear people talk in a very loose way of their 'being on the Rock', when they have very little idea of what they mean.<a name=72:10></a> To say that you are on the Rock is to say that you are connected with Christ, and, if so, you are prepared to find that Christ is sufficient for you in any circumstances in which you may be placed.<a name=72:11></a>

		Now I want you, beloved friends, to see how what I have been saying is established in the third chapter of Joshua; namely, that it is the measure of the strait you go through with God that is the measure of your strength.<a name=72:12></a> This great truth is brought out in the bed of Jordan -- in death.<a name=72:13></a> Here is a type of death!<a name=72:14></a> -- every bit of "bread" gone, not a thing left to support nature.<a name=72:15></a> What can be weaker than death?<a name=72:16></a> Well, "Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you"!<a name=72:17></a> See it in the death of

		I have read these two passages, the one as the closing testimony of the church on earth, the other as the state of the heart of the believer towards the Lord -- the affections of the bride.<a name=81:1></a> The public testimony in keeping with the state of heart in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:16">Revelation  22:16</a> is that of <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#25:1">Matthew  25:1</a> - 13, when at a certain time the kingdom of heaven, which was being spoken of, became like ten virgins, etc.<a name=81:2></a>

		Now for what brought about this state of things we must refer to the preceding chapter.<a name=81:3></a> There we read, "That evil servant shall say in his <i>heart</i>, My Lord delayeth his coming;" and as the consequence, "Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which .<a name=81:4></a>.<a name=81:5></a>.<a name=81:6></a> went forth to meet the bridegroom", and, "While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept".<a name=81:7></a> This is the sad state into which the church has fallen; but to explain it I must refer to its <i>normal</i> state.<a name=81:8></a> And before doing so I will say that the expression, "the kingdom of heaven", means the character of God's rule at a certain time, whilst the other rule -- that of the earth -- is going on at the same time; just as we say "The British rule in India".<a name=81:9></a> The rule is of a heavenly character; it is the kingdom of <i>heaven</i>.<a name=81:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But as to the kingdom all is a failure.<a name=83:4></a> We turn to Revelation, and find that the church, the candlesticks, have all failed.<a name=83:5></a> But before looking at it there, I turn to <a href="../bible/John.htm#21">John  21</a>to read two verses: "Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?<a name=83:6></a> Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?<a name=83:7></a>" Now, in connection with this, John gets, in the book of Revelation, this coming of the Lord, that which closes the history, and therefore I turn to it, and read in the first chapter -- "I saw seven golden candlesticks; and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.<a name=83:8></a> His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire; and his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.<a name=83:9></a> And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.<a name=83:10></a> And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead".<a name=83:11></a> Mark how changed everything is.<a name=83:12></a> Just look at <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>for a moment; for if you do not see how things were at first, you will not see how changed they are now.<a name=83:13></a> At verse 19 you read: "The same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.<a name=83:14></a> And when he had so said, he showed unto them his hands and his side.<a name=83:15></a> Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now when I turn to the book of Revelation, I find a change.<a name=84:7></a> I see Him in the midst of the seven churches, His eyes like a flame of fire, His feet like fine brass, His voice as the sound of many waters, and a sharp two-edged sword going out of His mouth.<a name=84:8></a> There is the aspect, the terrific aspect, of the Lord.<a name=84:9></a> How can you account for the change?<a name=84:10></a> It is that ecclesiastical corruption has come in, and He is indignant.<a name=84:11></a> Nothing makes any one so indignant as slighted affection.<a name=84:12></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>He was in all the delight of reciprocated affection.<a name=84:13></a> What is He now in the midst of the seven churches?<a name=84:14></a> He is there with such an aspect that John even cannot recognise Him.<a name=84:15></a> His eyes are like a <i>flame of fire</i>.<a name=84:16></a> I never talk to people about ecclesiastical corruption; I try to bring them near the Lord.<a name=84:17></a> You cannot keep mixed up with ecclesiastical corruption when you see the Lord's eyes; -- all bright and beautiful at first, but what now?<a name=84:18></a> "His eyes were as a flame of fire".<a name=84:19></a> Who can look at them?<a name=84:20></a> And why this change?<a name=84:21></a> Because He is indignant; His affection has been slighted.<a name=84:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Of course this is not all, but I just pass on to mark how the Lord completes His dealings with the church.<a name=85:5></a> Though He finds no love of theirs to speak of, yet His own has never failed; at the very last it is, "As many as I <i>love</i>, I rebuke and chasten".<a name=85:6></a> And what does He say to them?<a name=85:7></a> "Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me".<a name=85:8></a> He says, I do not give up my love, though you give up yours; all the dreary night I stand at the door and knock.<a name=85:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		All this I think plainly shows you that, looked at as an ecclesiastical testimony, the church is a failure.<a name=85:10></a> And when I turn to the last chapter of the book, I say, Is there then nothing for the Lord in the whole earth?<a name=85:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, here I find something new.<a name=85:12></a> The testimony <i>was</i> that of the wise virgins going forth to meet the Bridegroom; but now I find a little word of great importance -- "the <i>bride</i>".<a name=85:13></a> In the midst of all this ruin, then, there will be a bride, When the Lord comes, He will find a bride here.<a name=85:14></a> That "bright and morning star" will so gain the affections of the saints, that they, in company with the Holy Spirit, will invite Him to come.<a name=85:15></a> The cry has gone forth, "Behold, the bridegroom".<a name=85:16></a> The Lord says, "Surely I

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will explain now what the bride is in character, and also show what is the effect upon the saint of being in that position.<a name=86:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The importance of the bride's hope is, that practically, that affection is awakened in my heart which invites Him to come, and this makes me fit for Him to come.<a name=86:3></a> His coming is the only thing that answers to the affections of my heart.<a name=86:4></a> Now what would prepare a heart -- what would make a heart fit to say these words, "Come, Lord Jesus"?<a name=86:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I turn again to <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>because there that which characterises the bride begins.<a name=86:6></a> Mary in heart is representative of the bride.<a name=86:7></a> Now there are four different things that characterise the bride.<a name=86:8></a> First, the heart must be won; second, it must be satisfied; third, it must be made suitable; and lastly, comes service.<a name=86:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But first, you must be <i>won</i>.<a name=86:10></a> Mary's heart here is wholly won; I need not show that to you, for it is evident.<a name=86:11></a> She is inconsolable without Him.<a name=86:12></a> She, like the bride of Canticles, seeks Him whom her soul loves.<a name=86:13></a> That is the effect in the saint of the heart being won and not satisfied.<a name=86:14></a> A heart won and not satisfied is a miserable heart; it does not possess the object of its affections.<a name=86:15></a> And many are in that state; the affections His, but no sense of being united to Him; they are bright one day and cast down another, just like the bride in Canticles.<a name=86:16></a> There is no sense of union, for affection is not union.<a name=86:17></a> You may love the Lord in the deepest, fullest way, and yet it may only make you miserable because you are not with Him, because you do not know union.<a name=86:18></a> The very fact of my heart being won makes it dissatisfied; I am inconsolable without the One I love; nothing but His company satisfies me.<a name=86:19></a> A heart fully won knows the Lord in a two-fold way: as a

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next thing to having the heart won is to have it satisfied; and that is what Mary also is in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>.<a name=87:2></a> He says to her: "Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God".<a name=87:3></a> She goes, no longer inconsolable, but satisfied, to tell her message.<a name=87:4></a> She is satisfied through knowing Him where He is; it is "<i>My</i> Father, and <i>your</i> Father"; "<i>My</i> God, and <i>your</i> God".<a name=87:5></a> <i>Association with Christ where Christ is alone satisfies my heart</i>.<a name=87:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And as I know Him up there, I find that the One who has gone down into judgment for me, that same blessed One who is now set down on the Father's throne is the One who bears me company on my path down here; He has won my heart, and the affection increases as we go along.<a name=87:7></a> He is there as the Priest to sustain me, and the Advocate to restore me.<a name=87:8></a> I have an Advocate when I sin; and because of this I confess; and God is faithful and just to forgive me my sins, and to cleanse me from all unrighteousness.<a name=87:9></a> The man who sins and does not confess loses the sense of divine favour.<a name=87:10></a> The one who confesses goes in and condemns himself, and God says, I come and forgive you all unrighteousness; and thus the heart is kept up fresh in the knowledge of His love.<a name=87:11></a> He will sustain me in all that bright scene.<a name=87:12></a> The Spirit carries me into it all -- into the holiest -- and He is the One who sustains me when I am in.<a name=87:13></a>

		The twenty-second psalm is an account of what the Lord went through for us.<a name=115:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two subjects in this psalm: one, that this blessed One bore all that was against us; the other, that He declared the Father.<a name=115:2></a> These two things, when you come to understand them, bring out distinctly the fact that He was the Son of God.<a name=115:3></a> So much so, that Paul, after seeing Him, went into the synagogue and preached that <i>Jesus</i> -- the Man -- was the <i>Son of God</i>.<a name=115:4></a> We have it "Christ" in our translation; but the right word is "Jesus".<a name=115:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now mark, for you may not at first see why the Person who endured all that was against me, and the Person who declared the Father, must be the Son of God -- that it proves it.<a name=115:6></a> First, there never was a man who knew the nature of my offence against God; and next there never was a man who knew the love in the heart of God to a sinner.<a name=115:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There never was any man but One who knew these two things; and He who knew them must necessarily be equal with God in order to know how He felt as to each.<a name=115:8></a> A child does not know how I feel.<a name=115:9></a> People misunderstand the feelings of one another simply because they have not the same order of intellect.<a name=115:10></a> You must have a mind equal to that of the person aggrieved if you would understand how he feels about the grievance.<a name=115:11></a>

		the Son of God, or He could not have known it.<a name=116:1></a> Well, that Man comes to bear it.<a name=116:2></a> There were two things known to Him that were never known to any other man, and these two things prove that He was the Son of God: no other man knew the amount of my debt but Himself; and no other man ever knew the heart of God, and understood the love that He bore to me, but He.<a name=116:3></a> He alone could declare that love, just as He alone knew the nature of my offence.<a name=116:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As we grow holy we know something about it, but the unholy know nothing about it at all; we have no sense of what a terrible thing sin is in the mind of God, but as we get near Him; none ever knew what sin was in the mind of God as the Son of God did, and He was the One to bear it.<a name=116:5></a> But, besides this, as I have said, no one knew the love that was in the Father's heart for the prodigal but Himself, and therefore He comes out Himself to tell us what it is.<a name=116:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is what this psalm recounts to us: sins borne, and then the love of the Father declared.<a name=116:7></a> The one is when all the enemies are strewn upon the battlefield; He has encountered every foe, and laid them all prostrate; and then on that very battlefield, where they are all laid low, comes out this blessed, this unknown, eternal light; when there is not a foe left that He has not encountered, He brings into the scene the wonderful declaration of the Father's love to the poor wretched ones now rescued by His grace.<a name=116:8></a>

		Now I will show you the foes that He encountered for us.<a name=117:4></a> I do not think we bear along in our hearts sufficiently what Christ's path was for us down here.<a name=117:5></a> I do not mean merely to be looking at the story of it, or reading theoretically about His sufferings; I mean the entering in our hearts into what He actually went through for us, so that sin might come before us as "exceeding sinful".<a name=117:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I will go through the psalm in detail.<a name=117:7></a> We may notice that generally in a psalm it is the greatest thing that begins or heads it.<a name=117:8></a> And I state according to my judgment, that a psalm is always the record of what the soul has gone through.<a name=117:9></a> When you write the psalm you recount what you have gone through.<a name=117:10></a> So I find I cannot read a psalm well till I am out of the thing it recounts, because it was written by one who had got out of it.<a name=117:11></a> When I am in the depths it is no use to read it; but, when I am out again, then I can bear the recital of what I have been through, and then is my time to read it; I am exercised in the place I am in to see how I reached it.<a name=117:12></a>

		Now I find that the gospel is preached in three different ways.<a name=135:2></a> Some preach, very sincerely, Christ as bearing the judgment of sin; and very true this is, otherwise how could you face God?<a name=135:3></a> Many a person has only got this, and is therefore never pleased but in hearing a gospel sermon; it is not that he has not got forgiveness of his sins, but he is not quite sure of it, and wants to look at it again and again, like a person reading over a balance account.<a name=135:4></a> The second way of preaching the gospel is, I admit, a very full gospel, but it is defective It is, that God so loved the world as to send His Son to bring us to heaven.<a name=135:5></a> Now there is just one word here that makes it defective, and that is <i>heaven</i>.<a name=135:6></a> If you substitute "God" for "heaven" then you have a perfect gospel.<a name=135:7></a> But, as it stands, it has only brought you to a place instead of to God.<a name=135:8></a> True the judgment was upon us, Christ has come in and borne it, and gone up and opened heaven to us; all this is true, but you have not got it all unless you bring in the word <i>God</i> -- Christ has entered "into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of <i>God</i> for us".<a name=135:9></a>

		To show you how connected this is with the gospel, I turn to <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15">Luke  15</a>.<a name=135:10></a> You have here the Lord announcing what the Father's delight is in receiving the prodigal.<a name=135:11></a> We have here three parables, and we find the answer to all in the case of the thief on the cross.<a name=135:12></a> There the Lord was the shepherd going out after the lost sheep; the Holy Spirit, figured by the woman who sought the silver piece, was there opening the heart of the thief; and the Father, as we see in the rending of the veil, comes out to embrace him.<a name=135:13></a> And then see how the Father says, "Bring hither the fatted calf".<a name=135:14></a> It is not a great way off that the prodigal is now, he

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second is: "Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.<a name=137:13></a> So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee".<a name=137:14></a> You have got the sense of your own nothingness -- that you are lower than a man -- a very beast.<a name=137:15></a> As Job says, "I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can be withholden from thee.<a name=137:16></a>.<a name=137:17></a>.<a name=137:18></a>.<a name=137:19></a> I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear; but now mine eye seeth thee.<a name=137:20></a> Wherefore I abhor myself".<a name=137:21></a> It is a painful thing, but a necessary thing to get a true sense of one's nothingness.<a name=137:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The third is: "Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand".<a name=137:23></a> That is one of the most wonderful and blessed things connected with the presence of God, that I am never so sure as when I am in it that I am an object to Him.<a name=137:24></a> "I am <i>continually</i> with thee!<a name=137:25></a>" Though I am nothing at all, yet I never before was so confident that I am an object to Him.<a name=137:26></a> And where would you ever get that sense but in His

		In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#84">Psalm  84</a>you get a twofold blessedness, There is, "<i>Blessed</i> are they that <i>dwell in thy house</i>", before you get "<i>Blessed</i> is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the ways of them, Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well".<a name=141:6></a> You have the home before you set out on the race.<a name=141:7></a> The one who dwells in the house "will be still <i>praising</i> thee", He will be <i>always</i> doing it.<a name=141:8></a> And after that comes the other blessedness, for it is another thing altogether; it is a race through a vale of tears; but, even there, whilst passing through such a scene as that, you come as a servant; you come to serve others in it.<a name=141:9></a> But, whilst serving, your characteristic mark is that you are racing; you are not at home in the place in which you serve.<a name=141:10></a>

		Here we find three things.<a name=142:3></a> In verse 8 we read: "Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ".<a name=142:4></a> Here I get my <i>object</i>.<a name=142:5></a> The apostle tells me in these words what his own practical walk in the wilderness was: he had but one object -- <i>Christ</i>.<a name=142:6></a>

		If I talk to a painter who is studying a work of art, I find that he is imbibing the beauties he is studying; and just so I study Christ, but with this very great difference that, as I study Him, I am formed like Him; as I study the beauty of Christ I am growing like Him; nothing can be more captivating to the heart, than this growing like the Person whom I love; and, as I grow like Him, I get more enlarged power and taste to appreciate Him; I so admire Him, that I give up the old man altogether.<a name=142:7></a> There are two pictures hanging on that wall; one, the most beautiful painting that you can possibly imagine; the other has some lovely tints in it.<a name=142:8></a> Surely I shall surrender the latter, when I can have the former.<a name=142:9></a> Now that is just what the apostle is doing here; he is not merely giving up man's evil things, but it is the good ones that there are in nature, even these he will not have, that he may get Christ in a deeper fuller way.<a name=142:10></a> I give up all the beauty of the old picture, in order that I may have the enjoyment of the far greater beauties of the new.<a name=142:11></a> The beauties in Christ are of a lasting nature; the beauties of nature will not stand.<a name=142:12></a> Nature gives way under pressure, not so Christ: the Lord would have loved His mother no matter how she might

		The two great things which mark christianity are the Person, and the place -- what the apostle is insisting on in Hebrews is the <i>place</i>; and the place is the most difficult thing to get souls to accept, because people will have earth and not heaven.<a name=144:9></a> But you <i>must</i> get the place first; for how can I find any person unless I know the place he is in?<a name=144:10></a> If I were in the place I should soon find the person; so in Hebrews it is the place that is insisted on.<a name=144:11></a> Of course you find Christ as your <i>Saviour</i> first.<a name=144:12></a>

		There are three things, beloved friends, that I have before my mind to say a little upon to you now.<a name=153:1></a> One of these is: what does grace make us?<a name=153:2></a> what is christianity?<a name=153:3></a> It is very elementary, you may say; but I feel it very important these days to go back to elementary things to see if we are what we know we are -- to find out whether we are, in our practice, up to our intelligence.<a name=153:4></a> It is a sad state of things when the intelligence gets beyond the heart.<a name=153:5></a> Those whose hearts are beyond their intelligence are the ones God instructs; and, in every case in Scripture, the ones the Lord uses are those whose hearts are beyond their intelligence.<a name=153:6></a> Therefore, though without doubt intelligence is a good thing, yet it is the heart God looks at.<a name=153:7></a>

		The three things I wish to speak a little on are: first -- what christianity is; second -- what we are coming to -- what is the consummation of things; and third -- what is the Lord's thought about us at this present moment.<a name=153:8></a> What grace has made us, is the first thing.<a name=153:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If I look at the Lord's walk on earth, everything He did was to consummate the will of God; and He did it.<a name=153:10></a> And now what is He thinking of?<a name=153:11></a> Not my standing, or state before God, for that has been accomplished by His work in the cross.<a name=153:12></a> It is my state here He is thinking of.<a name=153:13></a> You may say, But we have to learn our standing first; and I answer, Yes: of course you cannot be in a state in keeping with your standing, without knowing what that standing is; so before we come to this point I will ask you to go over with me a little what christianity really is.<a name=153:14></a>

		To put it in the plainest way: when Christ was here upon earth, it was heaven that He was thinking of; now that He is in heaven, it is earth He is thinking of.<a name=154:1></a> There are two parts in christianity -- two experiences; and you get them both in the parable of the prodigal son.<a name=154:2></a> The first is, that I am cleared of everything that stood between me and God by the blood of Christ.<a name=154:3></a> There is no such thing as God imputing sin to you any more.<a name=154:4></a> I admit there is often weakness in the heart as to this, but the fact is God does not impute sin any more.<a name=154:5></a> But, says one, I know I do sin.<a name=154:6></a> I know you do and will, but you must not lost sight of the fact that God says: "Their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more".<a name=154:7></a> This is the first experience in christianity.<a name=154:8></a> I know that in the heart of God there is no remembrance of my sins.<a name=154:9></a>

		Then when you <i>do</i> sin, what do you do?<a name=154:10></a> I go into the light, and the light finds it all out.<a name=154:11></a> I remember its being pointed out to me once in a show-room, that silver, when placed in a full blaze of light, any tarnish there might have been on it was no longer visible; so, when the soul is brought into the light, all the tarnish upon it is judged, and put away.<a name=154:12></a> And this is repentance.<a name=154:13></a> Repentance is my putting the flesh that did the crime into the same place in which God put it, that the body of sin might be destroyed, and He has never taken it from thence.<a name=154:14></a> <i>I</i> take it away, alas!<a name=154:15></a> and repentance is when I go and put it back again there where He put it.<a name=154:16></a> The effect of the light is to make me do this.<a name=154:17></a> But when a man goes on moping (I must use plain words), talks of how he falls into this and that failure, why, he does not get into the light at all.<a name=154:18></a> Such a one spoils the prayer-meetings and the worship-meetings, and all because he will not go into the light.<a name=154:19></a> The light would say, I cannot have this tarnish.<a name=154:20></a> The light makes manifest the evil, and,

		I want you just to get down to the lowest point, and I say, Have you really learned the efficacy of that blood in the sight of God?<a name=155:20></a> Have you learned that He says, "When I see the blood, I will pass over you"?<a name=155:21></a> I go to a pagan and I say, What do you bow under that wheel for?<a name=155:22></a> To appease the Almighty.<a name=155:23></a> All right, I say; but the question is, <i>Can</i> you appease Him?<a name=155:24></a> You cannot.<a name=155:25></a> I do not object to the word "appease".<a name=155:26></a> I think that conscience must have got into a very low state that does not know that God needs appeasing.<a name=155:27></a> And, when he acknowledges it, then I preach to him Jesus; I tell him that God has sent His Son -- that God is love: that when the sinner could not meet God in righteousness, then God said I will meet the difficulty Myself.<a name=155:28></a> And what is the effect of this upon my soul?<a name=155:29></a>

		This will touch us all very closely, that the favours of God here upon earth, instead of turning our hearts to God, only tend to make us independent of Him.<a name=166:5></a> Prosperity makes a man independent of God; when money accumulates he has an opportunity of gratifying self, and, unless he be able to deny himself in the midst of plenty, it will prove a snare to him.<a name=166:6></a> This is the principle that Babylon was formed upon.<a name=166:7></a> Nimrod was a mighty hunter before the Lord; that is, he pursued the object that attracted his heart -- his <i>game</i>, if you like -- he pursues it to <i>death</i>.<a name=166:8></a> A saint may be like Noah; he drinks of the wine and exposes his weakness; but that is not what a hunter is: a hunter is girt up to his work.<a name=166:9></a> He does not lose his senses in the least; he is all on the alert; it is the most exhilarating pursuit -- human energy reaching to its goal.<a name=166:10></a> That is what the beginning of this Babel is.<a name=166:11></a>

		Besides Babylon, however, there is another city coming, of which I cannot say much, for there is but little told us about it; but this I can say, that it is what Christ Himself has formed, and that in it there is every beauty that He Himself can bestow on it -- it is the display of all His divine beauty as a Man to the earth.<a name=167:8></a> In the one there is every natural attraction <i>without</i> God; in the other every heavenly attraction <i>with</i> God.<a name=167:9></a> And you are contributing to one or the other, for you must belong to one of the two.<a name=167:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are different ways of carrying out this thought.<a name=183:2></a> You get in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5">Ephesians  5</a>that "Christ .<a name=183:3></a>.<a name=183:4></a>.<a name=183:5></a> loved the church, and gave himself for it"; but then comes another thing: "That He might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word".<a name=183:6></a> I do not know whether our hearts enter sufficiently into the fact of what He is thus occupied with now -- of what He is securing for us now.<a name=183:7></a> It is not glory He is now securing; He <i>has</i> secured that.<a name=183:8></a> All His service on earth consummated in this, that I am placed before the Father's eye as He Himself is -- "accepted in the Beloved".<a name=183:9></a> Therefore sanctification cannot come in properly until I know that "Christ .<a name=183:10></a>.<a name=183:11></a>.<a name=183:12></a> loved the church and gave himself for it".<a name=183:13></a>

		It is important to make the foundation sure with souls.<a name=183:14></a> To clear the ground, I will first say a few words upon the fact that we are given "all things that pertain unto life and godliness".<a name=183:15></a> Christ has cleared away everything that was against us in the sight of God, so that now "there is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus".<a name=183:16></a> The adding of the latter part of that verse in our version shows the ignorance of souls generally about this.<a name=183:17></a> As a rule, people know that Christ's blood has washed away their sins, but what they are slow to learn is, that God has crucified on the cross the thing that did the sins.<a name=183:18></a> There are the two things that I have alluded to already: one, the <i>blood</i> of Christ -- "without shedding of blood is no remission"; the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=184>[Page 184]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		other, the <i>death</i> of Christ -- "in that he died, he died unto sin once; but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God"; "death hath no more dominion over him".<a name=184:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I sometimes think, that while some of the evangelists are very clear in showing that the blood of Christ has atoned for sins, they are not so clear in showing that the thing that did the sins is crucified.<a name=184:2></a> You may act in the flesh, but you are not in it.<a name=184:3></a> God put both my sins and the flesh that did them on the cross of Christ.<a name=184:4></a> If I act in the flesh, I must, when I go to God, put it where God put it; and that is repentance.<a name=184:5></a> I am not merely sorry for the sin, but I abhor that which did it; and "godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of", People are generally sorry for the wrong things they have done, and try to conceal them, and this is just what I often find with saints -- that they are sorry for what they have done; but that is not the question.<a name=184:6></a> Are you sorry for the thing that is in you?<a name=184:7></a> Do you repudiate that which did the sins?<a name=184:8></a>

		God sees me acting in the flesh, but He never sees me in it.<a name=184:9></a> I am as dead in the sight of God this moment as if I were in my grave; otherwise it would be <i>my</i> death that would free my soul and not <i>Christ's</i>.<a name=184:10></a> This has led to a great deal of confusion in minds, To me there is nothing plainer in Scripture than the doctrine of purgatory; but man puts purgatory in the wrong place.<a name=184:11></a> God does punish a man for sin after he is dead on the cross, but that does not mean after his body is in the grave.<a name=184:12></a> "You only have I known of all the families of the earth: <i>therefore</i> I will punish you for all your iniquities".<a name=184:13></a> God does deal with souls for their sins.<a name=184:14></a> If you judge yourself -- and it is not an easy matter -- you will have to put your flesh where God puts it, and out of which place He never sees the old man.<a name=184:15></a> There is no repentance without this.<a name=184:16></a> The

		moment I believe in Christ I find that God has cleared away all my sins in the death of Christ, and not only my sins but my old man; the nature that did the sins is ended in His sight.<a name=185:1></a> Do I act in the flesh?<a name=185:2></a> I quite admit it; but, if I do, I am reviving what God has put to death; I have done two wrong things: I have done what was wrong; and I have revived that which God put an end to in the cross of Christ.<a name=185:3></a> I am speaking now of the place where the soul would find itself as to what Christ has done for it before God -- clear of sins and sin too.<a name=185:4></a> The work has been finished according to God.<a name=185:5></a> He meets the mind of God; we could not meet it.<a name=185:6></a> In speaking of the woman of Samaria He says: "My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish <i>his</i> work".<a name=185:7></a> And then again: "I have glorified thee on the earth; I have finished the work which <i>thou</i> gavest me to do".<a name=185:8></a> He was sent of the Father to clear everything away, and He has done it.<a name=185:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And now I come to another point.<a name=185:10></a> There was not a single thing that He did from Calvary onwards that He did not do for me -- I mean for the believer.<a name=185:11></a> There was not a thing that He did for Himself, and in all He glorified the Father.<a name=185:12></a> He did not die for Himself; He died for me, He rose for me; of course He did not need to rise for Himself; He got the resurrection for believers.<a name=185:13></a> He went in to discharge the debt for me; and He not only discharged it so as to let me go free, but discharged it in such a way as to win glory for me as well.<a name=185:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think the resurrection of Christ is a great deal more than the receipt for my debt; that is the word that is familiarly used for it; but that is only its aspect towards <i>you</i>.<a name=185:15></a> The question is, What is the resurrection to <i>God</i>?<a name=185:16></a> Our side of it is quite true.<a name=185:17></a> If you pay into a bank a sum due there, in whose name do you get the receipt?<a name=185:18></a> Of course, in the name of the person who owed the debt.<a name=185:19></a> So we read:

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=186>[Page 186]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"To whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead".<a name=186:1></a> He has cleared all for the believer.<a name=186:2></a> But He discharged the debt in such a way -- He glorified God so under the judgment of sin, that God's satisfaction must be expressed.<a name=186:3></a> I say the resurrection of Christ is a great deal more than the receipt for the debt; He is raised from the dead by the <i>glory</i> of the Father; so Peter says here, He "has called us by <i>glory</i> and virtue", for glory is the expression of the divine satisfaction in that man who, having descended from the mount where He culminated as the perfectly righteous One upon earth, glorified God under the weight of the judgment due to my sins, and God has glorified Him.<a name=186:4></a> So I have got my Saviour in glory, and that is the "glad tidings of the glory".<a name=186:5></a> I look at the glory as the expression of the divine satisfaction in that One who paid my debt.<a name=186:6></a> If I may use such an illustration, it is as if the bank were so satisfied at the wonderful way in which the debt is discharged, that it not only gives the receipt, but it illuminates, and keeps up a perpetual illumination to display for ever the sense of its satisfaction at the mode and manner in which the debt was discharged.<a name=186:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Immense time is lost as to growth, if you have not learned that God has dealt with Christ about the thing that did the sin.<a name=186:8></a> I do not deny that flesh is there still, and that is the very thing that I have to come to sanctification about; but I say that I stand perfectly clear as to it before God, and that, when I do sin, the very place of all others that I can go to is God Himself.<a name=186:9></a> When I get to Him the light makes manifest.<a name=186:10></a> I feel it there, I put the sin where God put it, and I never get liberty till then.<a name=186:11></a> As Paul says to the Galatians: "Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free", When did he say that?<a name=186:12></a> When Ishmael had

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So I start you with the fact that you are clear in the sight of God.<a name=187:3></a> The moment you stand in His presence there is nothing at all against you there, neither the thing that is done, nor the thing that did it.<a name=187:4></a> "Ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit.<a name=187:5></a>.<a name=187:6></a>.<a name=187:7></a>.<a name=187:8></a> Now, if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his".<a name=187:9></a> I trust that everyone of you accepts that, and the more you insist upon it, the more you glorify God.<a name=187:10></a> I say you cannot improve your acceptance, you cannot alter it, and you cannot lose it; three things surely that ought to establish the heart in perfect comfort.<a name=187:11></a> I believe in the One who knew what was the hindrance to the love in the heart of God, who knew what hindered it from travelling out to reach the prodigal, and who says, I take it away so perfectly that that love can flow out in all its mighty volume to the greatest wretch on earth -- can take hold of him and lead him up to the glory.<a name=187:12></a> That is the first point: "To them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ".<a name=187:13></a> These are the ones whom the apostle is addressing, and if this be not known, there is no use in talking about sanctification.<a name=187:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I come to the second point: Christ's present thought about us.<a name=187:15></a> If He "loved the church and gave himself for it", it is "that he might sanctify .<a name=187:16></a>.<a name=187:17></a>.<a name=187:18></a> it".<a name=187:19></a> His present thought about each of us is <i>sanctification</i>.<a name=187:20></a> If I say, What is Christ thinking about me today?<a name=187:21></a> the answer is, He is thinking about sanctifying me.<a name=187:22></a> Well, what is that?<a name=187:23></a> I think it is most important to know.<a name=187:24></a> Sanctification does not add one bit to my acceptance, but it does to my acceptability.<a name=187:25></a> Acceptance is what Christ has gained for me; acceptability is what the Spirit of God is working out in me.<a name=187:26></a> The more simply I admit my acceptance,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=188>[Page 188]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the more I glorify Christ; and the more anxious I am about my acceptability, the more I honour His grace.<a name=188:1></a> There are the two things -- grace and responsibility.<a name=188:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I turn to <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>first, to see what sanctification is in its character, before I look at its practical bearing on ourselves.<a name=188:3></a> Here the Lord is expressing His desires to the Father, and there are two ways in which He speaks of the sanctification being produced.<a name=188:4></a> One is, "Sanctify them through thy truth".<a name=188:5></a> The truth here is the revelation of the Father.<a name=188:6></a> The other sanctification is quite a different thing.<a name=188:7></a> "For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth".<a name=188:8></a> That is, I have left the place altogether, that they may in heart follow me.<a name=188:9></a> Now if you understand these two verses, you will see the effect they will produce on you.<a name=188:10></a> One is what you <i>have</i> here; the other is what you have <i>not</i> here; and this is not difficult to understand.<a name=188:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, it is "Sanctify them through thy truth".<a name=188:12></a> I will explain how that is done.<a name=188:13></a> I am of the Father now, and not of the world.<a name=188:14></a> I am in this new relationship -- in a new dependence.<a name=188:15></a> Supposing a man knocks me down in the street; if I call a policeman, then I am calling the world.<a name=188:16></a> But suppose I say, God is my Father; He will undertake for me, and I will leave it all with Him; then I am sanctified by the truth.<a name=188:17></a> I do not turn to the world because I have the Father, and I know what the Father's love is; that is what sanctifies me.<a name=188:18></a> And you will find you have lost your place as a sanctified man the moment you turn to the world for help, or are of it.<a name=188:19></a> It is curious how people are tried about this.<a name=188:20></a> I have lost the world, but I have got the Father.<a name=188:21></a> And this is what Christ had; therefore, He begins by telling them, "I have overcome the world;" and thus I have the Father's love down here, His love to the

		Son; "the love wherewith thou hast loved me" is my portion.<a name=189:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Some may say, I wonder, if God is your Father, that He does not interfere more on your behalf.<a name=189:2></a> But I answer, I know His love, and the more I know it, the less I need demonstrations of it.<a name=189:3></a> Christ had little or no demonstration of that love, but He never lost the sense that He was ever the object of it; and it imparts the greatest dignity to be in His path -- to be nobody to man, but to be an object to God.<a name=189:4></a> And often in the very place where we have been made little of in the eyes of men, there God makes us remarkable.<a name=189:5></a> At Philippi, where Paul and Silas were made so little of before men, they are made much of as God's men, not as the world's men.<a name=189:6></a> God says, I will have you acknowledge that man; he is a man of God.<a name=189:7></a> There is "a God that judgeth in the earth".<a name=189:8></a> God thus comes in to maintain the cause of His people, though not always at the time.<a name=189:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is an immense thing for the heart to get hold of -- "Sanctify them through thy truth" -- the knowledge that I am of the Father.<a name=189:10></a> But can you walk through the world and say, I do not appeal to it?<a name=189:11></a> It is just the difference between a man in the wilderness and a man in Egypt.<a name=189:12></a> In Egypt I turn to the world, but in the wilderness I have not got anybody but God.<a name=189:13></a> If I am of the world, of course I can claim its protection.<a name=189:14></a> And yesterday I might be in it -- a man in Egypt, but today I am in the wilderness -- in the same town, in the same business, in the same house.<a name=189:15></a> What is the difference?<a name=189:16></a> Why, today, in the wilderness, I have none but God; and it is this knowledge of the Father that sanctifies me; it has the most wonderful separating power; through it I escape "the corruption that is in the world through lust".<a name=189:17></a> I am not dependent on the world for any one thing here, for I have a Father outside and apart from it all.<a name=189:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=190>[Page 190]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second thing is, that my heart is gone out of the place altogether.<a name=190:1></a> Christ says: <i>I</i> go out of the place altogether, and the consequence is <i>they</i> will all come after me.<a name=190:2></a> How could I stay in a world where He is not?<a name=190:3></a> How could I be attached to a place whence He has gone?<a name=190:4></a> "The bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days".<a name=190:5></a> It is a wonderful weaning from all things here, knowing that He is gone.<a name=190:6></a> If I am looked at as here, I am separated from anything I might in nature want here -- I am separated from the action of the world in every sense -- because I know the Father.<a name=190:7></a> And then, on the other hand, I am taken out of this scene altogether, because He is gone away.<a name=190:8></a> And this is enough for every heart surely.<a name=190:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I come to the third part, which will occupy us more elaborately.<a name=190:10></a> What is this sanctification to produce in us?<a name=190:11></a> "For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth".<a name=190:12></a> The measure of my sanctification -- of my separation from things here -- is His.<a name=190:13></a> I am speaking of the mode by which it is accomplished.<a name=190:14></a> First, He has accomplished redemption; the thing that is to be accomplished now is sanctification.<a name=190:15></a> And what is Satan doing now?<a name=190:16></a> He is pressing it in the wrong way; he is setting up a fictitious thing, because saints have not taken the right ground about it.<a name=190:17></a> But let us defeat him by maintaining the right thing.<a name=190:18></a> Never contend with the wrong thing, but press the right.<a name=190:19></a> No person ever knows evil but by knowing good; you judge evil by the amount of good you know.<a name=190:20></a> Man lost good by doing evil, and now I must know good to be able to discover evil.<a name=190:21></a> The person best able to tell me what is wrong is the one who knows best what is right.<a name=190:22></a> I must get the divine idea of what is right.<a name=190:23></a> The spiritual man judges all things; he can distinguish between things where there is the least apparent difference.<a name=190:24></a>

		Christ, having accomplished everything for us as to redemption, then, is now thinking of us as to our sanctification.<a name=191:1></a> "The very God of peace sanctify you wholly", is His thought for us.<a name=191:2></a> I think we are not enough occupied with sanctification.<a name=191:3></a> I can measure my sanctification, because the measure and the principle are one; even that I have got the Father and not the world; and I have to be as separate from the world down here in which I remain, as Christ is up there where He is gone.<a name=191:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I come now to the practical effect of what we have been speaking of.<a name=191:14></a> I am sorry to say, that, instead of seeing more sanctification, I see less.<a name=191:15></a> The character of the world in itself is seductive; and besides this, Satan is very adroit in the way in which he manages to bring the world home to each one, as it is most ensnaring to him.<a name=191:16></a> He knows very well what your tastes and likings are.<a name=191:17></a> You may have great tastes and capacities for enjoying certain things, and you had better watch those tastes and capacities, for they are the avenues to your heart, and Satan knows them as well as you do, and a great deal better too.<a name=191:18></a> Consequently, the thing a man is most distinguished for in nature, is the thing he must be most guarded about.<a name=191:19></a> God will make it

		Now I turn to the chapter I have read, and here I find practice.<a name=192:9></a> We accept these two points -- one, accomplished, the other in the course of accomplishment.<a name=192:10></a> There are two things that mark the saint, and these two are put together in Scripture.<a name=192:11></a> One is, he believes with his heart; the other, he confesses with his mouth.<a name=192:12></a> One is inside, the other outside.<a name=192:13></a> If I take Jonathan as an example of this; he sees that Goliath is gone, and he is no longer occupied with Goliath and his fear of him, but with David, and owning him as his deliverer.<a name=192:14></a> I see at once if a soul is devoted to Christ; many an earnest person is not devoted because he has not got clear of Goliath -- he has still fears.<a name=192:15></a> But the moment he sees the dead man's head in the hand of the living man, his fears are gone, and he is taken up with David.<a name=192:16></a> "With the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation".<a name=192:17></a> It is the same thing in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7">Luke  7</a>.<a name=192:18></a> The

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is very important for us to understand what is the state of things in the church; and when I say "church" I mean the whole house of God, not the real thing, the body of Christ, but that which will be spued out of the Lord's mouth when He comes.<a name=208:1></a> It is very important for us who are on the verge of this, if not quite in it, to understand what will produce it.<a name=208:2></a> We may say, thank God, we know we are of the true thing; but still it is a great thing for us to see what produces and conduces to this state of things that Christ will thus spue out of His mouth, so that we may not in any way be helping it on ourselves.<a name=208:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the beginning of <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2">Revelation  2</a>I find the church has lost her first love, and in the end of chapter 3 He will do without her as a witness.<a name=208:4></a> In Laodicea the vessel of testimony is spued out of His mouth.<a name=208:5></a> And the terrible thing is that as soon as He thus rejects it, there is another power ready to pick it up -- a power that rises and says, This just suits me!<a name=208:6></a> The church unfit for Christ is fit for the beast.<a name=208:7></a> As soon as Christ has done with the church, the beast will arise and say, I will carry it, as we get it in chapter 17.<a name=208:8></a>

		Now this is a terrible thing -- a very serious thing, if we lay it to heart, to see how it is produced; and I think none of us can escape censure on the point, though we may escape judgment.<a name=208:9></a> For it is evident that Laodicea springs out of Philadelphia; it is evident that the state of the last of the churches is consequent upon the preceding one.<a name=208:10></a>

		A Laodicean, then, is one who has got Philadelphian light and has not got Philadelphian power.<a name=209:3></a> You see a Laodicean is not in system; he is neither in Romanism nor in Protestantism, and you must be in either of these two to be in system.<a name=209:4></a> I trust this will come home very closely to every one of us.<a name=209:5></a> It is a very important thing to get light, and light does lead out of system; but light is not everything.<a name=209:6></a> A Laodicean is one who has got light, but who has not that which the light should produce.<a name=209:7></a> Hence the Lord appears to Laodicea, saying, "These things saith the Amen, <i>the faithful and true witness</i>, the beginning of the creation of God".<a name=209:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		A Laodicean says what even a rich man would not say: "I .<a name=209:9></a>.<a name=209:10></a>.<a name=209:11></a> have need of nothing".<a name=209:12></a> I would say to any such, You have got the light, but you have not got Christ in power.<a name=209:13></a> A Rationalist said, "I have got rid of the author of christianity, but I have kept the morality of it", and that is just what the beast might say.<a name=209:14></a> What does he want christianity for?<a name=209:15></a> He wants christianity to so improve the man that he may be independent of God.<a name=209:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There are more examples of this in the word than I could possibly think of or put together now; but one or two will show you how the principle of the evil comes in.<a name=211:14></a> Who was it helped the children of Israel into idolatry?<a name=211:15></a> No one less than Aaron, the brother of Moses.<a name=211:16></a> Was there a want of light there?<a name=211:17></a> No; he had plenty of light, but he wanted to please the people.<a name=211:18></a> He was the one who was to carry out the words that Moses gave him from God, and this very man, whilst Moses was gone up the mountain to God, says: Give me your gold, and I will make a calf for you.<a name=211:19></a>

		I turn to another case, in <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#15">1 Samuel  15</a>.<a name=212:7></a> The point to get hold of, and it is a difficult one if a person does not work it out in his own heart, is that we are the people who are to blame, because by giving a place to the human element in our preachings and teachings, we have produced a type of christianity which is very human.<a name=212:8></a> In this chapter king Saul is sent to destroy Amalek.<a name=212:9></a> There is no mistake about what he is to do; he is not in the least ignorant; yet he keeps what suits himself, while he destroys the vile and refuse.<a name=212:10></a> He could not say he was not able to walk up to the light; but he spared the best, that which ministered most to man, what most pleased himself.<a name=212:11></a>

		I turn now to the New Testament, to <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>.<a name=213:2></a> Here the Lord says to Peter: "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven".<a name=213:3></a> The greatest light is shown to Peter; nothing could have been more wonderful than the Father giving such a revelation to him; it was light of the highest order.<a name=213:4></a> He had been given this light about the church.<a name=213:5></a> And, would you believe it, that this very man, in this very same chapter, foreshadows what a Laodicean is!<a name=213:6></a> He has light about the church, but he will not have the cross.<a name=213:7></a> Read farther on: "Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.<a name=213:8></a> But he turned, and said unto Peter.<a name=213:9></a> Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me; for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men".<a name=213:10></a> Thus it is possible that the person who has the greatest light may make the greatest mistake.<a name=213:11></a> Peter wants to spare the man.<a name=213:12></a>

		Thus I am clear of the badness by the blood of Christ, but I am clear of the goodness by Him in glory.<a name=226:5></a> It is not the sin of this world, it is what man calls goodness that most balks the saint in his progress.<a name=226:6></a> But what are good things here to what I see in the glory?<a name=226:7></a> The day is coming when all here will be burnt to ashes, but I have seen that which will never fade away; I have seen that which will endure in all its brightness for ever; and though I can see the beauty of this, it does not hold my heart a bit.<a name=226:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:13">Luke  24:13</a> - 36
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This chapter tells us the beginning -- how the Lord led His disciples on to the new ground on which they were to understand His relation to them and theirs to Him.<a name=229:1></a> In the last verse I read we find Him "in the midst of them".<a name=229:2></a> Therefore it is a matter of immense interest to us to know how it was brought about then, so that we may see how it is recovered to us now.<a name=229:3></a> But we must first understand that it has been lost, otherwise we cannot talk of recovery.<a name=229:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What then is the true order of meeting for the saints, or, to make it simple, what is "church order"?<a name=229:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there are hundreds of notions as to what it is, so that it is evident it is lost, or there could not be so many.<a name=229:6></a> This is the question then: What is the present relation of Christ to His people on earth?<a name=229:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24">Luke  24</a>is plainly the beginning, everyone will admit.<a name=229:8></a> And next we must admit that very soon after it failure set in.<a name=229:9></a> We see this in the seven churches of <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2">Revelation  2</a>and 3, where things go on from bad to worse until in Thyatira we get to Popery.<a name=229:10></a> After this we get Sardis: "Thou hast a name that thou livest".<a name=229:11></a> Things were better in appearance.<a name=229:12></a> Luther and Calvin tried to reform the church, but they never got at what had to be revived.<a name=229:13></a> There was in that sense a partial recovery at the Reformation; but in Philadelphia the truth is recovered.<a name=229:14></a> Every student of Scripture admits that Thyatira is Romanism, Sardis Protestantism; and that these four last churches go on to the end.<a name=229:15></a> Finally we get to Laodicea, "neither cold nor hot", and spued out of Christ's mouth.<a name=229:16></a> I

		think then that you will admit there is ruin, and that it is proved by the diversity of opinion that exists.<a name=230:1></a> There was certainly no second opinion in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24">Luke  24</a>.<a name=230:2></a> As I have said, differences began soon after, and became greater and more confirmed as we go on to Thyatira and Sardis.<a name=230:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now a point of great importance.<a name=230:4></a> When the greatest darkness has set in there is a revival.<a name=230:5></a> Mark this, for it is always God's way.<a name=230:6></a> When the ruin is irretrievable, then He comes in.<a name=230:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You can trace this principle all through Scripture.<a name=230:8></a> At the very beginning, in the garden of Eden, the ruin was irretrievable, but before God turned the man and the woman out there was a revival.<a name=230:9></a> Adam called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all living, and the Lord made coats of skins and clothed them.<a name=230:10></a> Wondrous grace of God in the midst of all the ruin!<a name=230:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We find the same in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#33">Genesis  33</a>; Abram was called by God out of Mesopotamia, and Isaac actually sent his son back there; but Jacob returns to the land, and in that sense Jacob is a revival.<a name=230:12></a> He had a new name given to him, and everything is bright for a time.<a name=230:13></a> He is pious, his altar he only calls El-elohe-Israel.<a name=230:14></a> It all turns around himself.<a name=230:15></a> This is just the snare into which those who are now being revived are liable to fall in the present day -- retaining the name of power without the character of it.<a name=230:16></a> Jacob ceases to be a pilgrim.<a name=230:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another snare comes out in Haggai.<a name=230:18></a> The remnant, the captives, have returned from Babylon to the land, and it is a wonderful thing that they should have returned at all.<a name=230:19></a> But, while they were at first set upon building the temple, when they were opposed and hindered they became occupied with their own blessings.<a name=230:20></a> There was a revival when all was in ruin, but there is a snare in that revival; and as we see Jacob lose the true place of a man restored

		to the land by the grace of God, cease to be a pilgrim and settle down at Shalem, so in Haggai we see the remnant cease to care for the house of God, and be occupied only with their own individual blessing.<a name=231:1></a> The temptation to us is to settle down here; and, while pious, like Jacob, to think nothing of the house of God like the people in Haggai's time, though seeking the good of our own souls.<a name=231:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we see that God does revive, and that when the ruin is irretrievable; and that before it actually does occur He brings in a revival.<a name=231:3></a> Having established this point I come to another.<a name=231:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But first I must make one remark.<a name=231:5></a> The word "revival" is often wrongly used.<a name=231:6></a> A "revival meeting" for unconverted souls is quite erroneous, for there is nothing there to revive.<a name=231:7></a> I can revive a sleeping saint, but I cannot revive an unconverted sinner.<a name=231:8></a> And when a word is wrongly used there is sure to be a wrong thought at the bottom.<a name=231:9></a> So in this case.<a name=231:10></a> The great thing that is wrong in this idea of revival meetings is the thought that there is something in man to work on.<a name=231:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what is true revival?<a name=231:12></a> The recovery of what has been lost; and the first thing to be recovered is the first thing that was lost.<a name=231:13></a> You will find, every one of you, that when you begin to fall away it is the best bit of truth that you have that you give up first; just as in a storm it is the top shoot of the tree that goes.<a name=231:14></a> A man who talks to me of heavenly truth being impracticable, that man is going to give it up as sure as can be; he may not be lost, but he is going back.<a name=231:15></a> Satan always addresses himself to the best bit of truth you hold; when you are growing cold you will find that it is the most advanced truth you hold that is in danger.<a name=231:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Just turn to <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2">Colossians  2</a>there the apostle says: "I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you".<a name=231:17></a> What is this great conflict for?<a name=231:18></a> It is to get

		them to the top.<a name=232:1></a> The apostle from his prison has written to the saints three epistles, Ephesians, Colossians, and Philippians.<a name=232:2></a> In Ephesians he shows them the wonderful place the church has in Christ; but in Colossians he is eager by the Spirit of God to carry them up to the mark.<a name=232:3></a> Do you know what the desire of Christ is for you?<a name=232:4></a> Do not tell me you know what He <i>did</i> for you; the question is, Do you know what He <i>desires</i> for you -- what the Holy Spirit is aiming at in your soul?<a name=232:5></a> It is that you should be complete in Christ -- it is that you may actually know that you are united to one another and united to Christ.<a name=232:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He says, I have great conflict for you; it was a great point to be assured of this wonderful position.<a name=232:7></a> To walk in it is the desire of Christ's heart for us, the aim of the Holy Spirit and the labour of the servant, for it is the accomplished purpose of God.<a name=232:8></a> And what has become of it?<a name=232:9></a> It is lost.<a name=232:10></a> Look at all the sects around us.<a name=232:11></a> They have kept their own order, their own forms, or their liturgies, but that is not what the apostle had conflict about, and if it be not, then it is lost; and the thing to be recovered is the thing that was lost.<a name=232:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I will prove to you that it was the best thing that went first.<a name=232:13></a> The church of Ephesus, so richly endowed, so highly gifted, lost their first love.<a name=232:14></a> They lost true affection of heart for Christ.<a name=232:15></a> It is the spring of everything to know myself united to Christ; to know the saints "knit together" unto Him, and He in our midst, the One who keeps us in happy harmony by His Spirit.<a name=232:16></a> This was what they lost, and the point of departure must be the point of restoration.<a name=232:17></a> This is the thing to maintain.<a name=232:18></a> It was what the apostle Paul was struggling for.<a name=232:19></a> And nothing stimulates me like knowing that it is the desire of the heart of Christ for me, for then I know that I have the Holy Spirit to back me up -- to be my power.<a name=232:20></a> The apostolic fathers never had it.<a name=232:21></a> You may read their

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The way in which the Lord first recovered it for His people was by bringing a devoted servant to see: I have a Head in heaven, and, if I, so must other saints; and one Head necessitates one body.<a name=233:6></a> This was true recovery.<a name=233:7></a> In Colossians the apostle says, "Not holding the Head"; the Head was lost to the church.<a name=233:8></a> But this was recovered, and the true relation of Christ and His people is made known.<a name=233:9></a> You must admit the fact that for 1800 years it was lost.<a name=233:10></a> If you say, How do you prove it?<a name=233:11></a> I answer, Show me anywhere that it was known.<a name=233:12></a> And, apart from history, you may see it from the attitude in which the Lord stands in the midst of the seven churches.<a name=233:13></a> John did not know Him: "His eyes were as a flame of fire, and his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace, and his voice as the sound of many waters".<a name=233:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The truth then has been restored to us; but I say, take care lest you make too much of knowledge.<a name=234:8></a> I believe that many a one accepts the truth who has never been led into it of God.<a name=234:9></a> These tend to Laodicea.<a name=234:10></a> A person may be able to explain to me most thoroughly and completely the ground of meeting for worship, may be able to teach me how solemn a thing it is to give out a hymn or read a scripture if I have not been led of the Spirit to do so, and yet he is on dangerous ground unless he has been led of God into it.<a name=234:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I find next that the Lord, in all revivals, always restores the best thing that has been lost.<a name=234:12></a> Jacob really had a very bright view of heaven.<a name=234:13></a> And when the whole nation was going off into desolation, God's own grace in dealing with them comes out.<a name=234:14></a> The Lord Himself is the light that God brings in: "The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up;" and yet very soon the house was left desolate.<a name=234:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe no person ever finds this true ground without being educated.<a name=235:3></a> I do not believe a soul can get it out of a book; the Lord only can teach him.<a name=235:4></a> The Lord educated His disciples at the beginning, soon though they may have lost what He taught them; and at the beginning of our present revival He took just as much pains to educate souls.<a name=235:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there are three great lessons in the education of a soul that is to learn church order; and, as I have said, he will not get them from this or that theological folio, for they are not in them.<a name=235:6></a> In this chapter the Lord leaves on record for us how He taught them to His disciples.<a name=235:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First we find: "Beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself".<a name=235:8></a> What was the first thing that God opened your mind to?<a name=235:9></a> Was it not that Christ is the object of all Scripture?<a name=235:10></a> The immense thing brought before the soul is Christ.<a name=235:11></a> Some little while ago I came across a man who said to me, "I have been reading the Bible for fifteen years and never saw Christ in it, but now I find it is all about Christ".<a name=235:12></a> So in the meetings years ago, the prominent thing brought out was that everything in the word related to Christ, the Holy Spirit thus taking the same pains with us as He did with the first disciples.<a name=235:13></a>

		Secondly, "He took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.<a name=235:14></a> And their eyes were opened, and they knew him".<a name=235:15></a> "He was known of them in breaking of bread".<a name=235:16></a> I do not mean that it was the Lord's supper; but there is the simple blessed fact of the soul being able to say, I have by

		These two (their hearts had burned within them by the way), now that they have seen Him, go straight back to Jerusalem, and whilst they are telling the tale of what had been done in the way, and how He was known to them in breaking of bread, we reach the third thing, which completes the education of a Philadelphian: "Jesus himself stood in the midst".<a name=236:3></a>

		Now if you turn to <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>you will find a parallel passage.<a name=236:4></a> Here we see the Lord first sending Mary Magdalene with the message: "Go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God and your God".<a name=236:5></a> She represents another condition of soul to that of the two disciples.<a name=236:6></a> We find two different states of soul and of knowledge, one represented by the two going to Emmaus.<a name=236:7></a> If you had asked them their feeling about Christ they would have said, Well, there is only disappointment as to it all; "we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel".<a name=236:8></a> But Mary's state is different.<a name=236:9></a> She is mourning because they have taken away the One she loved.<a name=236:10></a> She has not union, but she has affection, and she finds it intolerable to be here without Him.<a name=236:11></a> You will find many varieties of these two states of soul.<a name=236:12></a> But my point is, that He first sends Mary Magdalene with a message, and then the two disciples with another, and having thus prepared them for it, He stands in their midst and says, "Peace be unto you".<a name=236:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The subject we had on the previous evening was the present great revival of truth -- the way in which the Lord has led back His people to the knowledge of His mind as they had it at the beginning; so that, in fact, as some one expressed it lately when speaking on this subject, "extremes meet".<a name=239:1></a> We have had to go back to the first start of that which has since grown into an immense thing; we have had, as it were, to cancel "the mustard tree", while the Lord conducts us back to the bud of it -- to <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24">Luke  24</a>.<a name=239:2></a> I do not believe that any true soul has reached this point without having gone through a similar exercise to that of those we find in that chapter; taught by the Lord, he has reached the point where he discovers, not his salvation, but his relation to Christ and Christ's to him.<a name=239:3></a> He, as we saw, first opens to them the Scriptures, next, is known to them in the breaking of bread, and lastly, stands in their midst.<a name=239:4></a> I fear some have taken their place in the third, who have never known the second.<a name=239:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But this church order was almost immediately lost, because the central point, <i>Himself</i>, was lost.<a name=239:6></a> To Ephesus He says: "Because thou hast left thy first love .<a name=239:7></a>.<a name=239:8></a>.<a name=239:9></a> I will .<a name=239:10></a>.<a name=239:11></a>.<a name=239:12></a> remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent"; I will take away the power and ability to set forth light to others.<a name=239:13></a> And now, when ruin is irretrievable, He has brought in this revival.<a name=239:14></a> It is the most wonderful thing.<a name=239:15></a> Here we are amidst the debris of everything, and He says, I will bring you out again, though not in the illustrious and distinguished character that you bore at the beginning.<a name=239:16></a> I must take things up again where I

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What then is the nature of this preservation?<a name=240:7></a> There is a little word in <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1">2 Timothy  1</a>that will help us if we turn to it.<a name=240:8></a> It is: "Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me".<a name=240:9></a> The word translated in our version as "form" would he better rendered by "outline".<a name=240:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now notice that he does not say, "hold fast the sound words", nor does he say, "which form I gave you".<a name=240:11></a> I hope you understand the difference.<a name=240:12></a> He wants them to get hold of not only the words, but of the <i>scope</i> of them.<a name=240:13></a> It was the outline they were to keep.<a name=240:14></a> The words, he says, you got from me, but have you got a certain knowledge of the form, of the outline, of the scope of them?<a name=240:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And this is of great importance.<a name=240:16></a> You will find that every failure and defalcation of the people of God has been marked by this -- that they have lost sight of the scope of the word that God has given them.<a name=240:17></a> I find that Satan often comes in and upsets a soul about a word, but I say, I am not going to stand about a word: I know what the scope of the whole thing means.<a name=240:18></a> Just as one would say to a child, You have not taken in my <i>meaning</i>; so you will find at

		I will take just one or two examples to bring out what I mean, before going on to show how a soul being occupied with Christ learns what will suit him.<a name=241:2></a> In Eden, Satan occupies Eve with the penalty for eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and deceives her as to the nature of the penalty.<a name=241:3></a> She loses the positive meaning and scope of the word, led away and diverted from it under the impression that she will not suffer for going contrary to it.<a name=241:4></a>

		Noah might plead that he was not forbidden to plant a vineyard -- that there was no word of God interdicting it; but if he had kept to the form or scope of the word given to him, he would soon have seen that if he in any measure relaxed the reins of power he would forfeit the position to which he was called.<a name=241:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#33">Genesis  33</a>, I find Jacob returned to the land, and in that sense a revival; he had learned the power of God at the night of wrestling, having re-entered the land where his fathers had "sojourned .<a name=241:6></a>.<a name=241:7></a>.<a name=241:8></a> as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles".<a name=241:9></a> But he loses the scope of God's word, he settles down in the land.<a name=241:10></a> "He bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father".<a name=241:11></a> He might say the word of God had not forbidden him to do it, and there was no harm in it, but he was called out to be a pilgrim, and he now had lost that character.<a name=241:12></a> Oh!<a name=241:13></a> but I am a pious man, he might say, I have my altar.<a name=241:14></a> I do not give up the light and the truth that I have!<a name=241:15></a> True, but you have given up the <i>form</i> of the word, you have given up the great outline of your calling.<a name=241:16></a> God brought you back to set forth the fact that you are a pilgrim and a stranger here.<a name=241:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus I often find a man interpreting a passage in a gospel or an epistle, and failing in the interpretation, because he does not know the scope of it.<a name=242:6></a> A man does not know the geography of England because he knows the one county of Middlesex; he must know the scope of the whole country.<a name=242:7></a> "Sound words which thou hast heard", but the question is, have you got the scope of them?<a name=242:8></a> When any one insists on a text for this or that, it is evident he is only thinking of Middlesex; but if he were to leave out Middlesex in his delineation, I should be able to detect him by the sound words.<a name=242:9></a> I get the scope from the whole tenor of the sound words, but I can detect omission by the sound words themselves.<a name=242:10></a>

		There is another example in <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#13">1 Chronicles  13</a>, where David gets a new cart to bring the ark of God home in.<a name=242:11></a> He had heard of its being done before by the Philistines; facts were in favour of it; history stood up for it; and there was no text to forbid it; and so he has the cart.<a name=242:12></a> And the worst of these things is that they always go well at first; there is no harm in them.<a name=242:13></a> And so it goes on all right until the oxen stumble, and then the smash comes.<a name=242:14></a> David was led away by expediency; he did not understand the scope and nature of God's counsel.<a name=242:15></a> So we find he has to fight the Philistines who brought the leaven in, and when he has thus cleared

	<div class="paragraph">
		One example in the New Testament.<a name=243:3></a> In <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2">Galatians  2</a>, Paul takes Titus, a Greek, with him to Jerusalem, but he would not have him circumcised.<a name=243:4></a> He says, I will not give way on this point, that the truth of the gospel may continue with you.<a name=243:5></a> And after that he adds, Neither will I give way before the old apostle.<a name=243:6></a> When Peter came to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to he blamed; I must stand up for the truth of the gospel, I must keep it up to its full scope, up to the mind of the Lord.<a name=243:7></a> If I yield, either in the case of the young disciple or of the old apostle, I shall be giving up the form of sound words.<a name=243:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is an interesting point to consider.<a name=243:9></a> You will find when you come to deal with people, that they have not got the scope of truth at all; they have lost the form.<a name=243:10></a> "Form", as I have said, is a very inadequate word; it is really more the <i>delineation</i> of a thing.<a name=243:11></a> Nothing makes it so plain to my mind as a map.<a name=243:12></a> I must keep the whole thing in my thought, or I get into confusion according to divine order.<a name=243:13></a>

		What, then, is the object of all we have been looking at?<a name=243:15></a> It is that, if in the things of man it is so important I should be able to distinguish things as they are -- that I should know their true form and size -- how much more important is it in the things of God?<a name=243:16></a> And in these I must get everything from God Himself.<a name=243:17></a> I am entirely dependent upon

		But, you say, how am I to get into this place?<a name=244:4></a> I turn to <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#25">Matthew  25</a>, to show you how the Lord brings His saints to it.<a name=244:5></a> Here the church has lost its hope; it has gone to sleep; there is no activity of life.<a name=244:6></a> The Lord comes in and wakens us up by the simple fact, not of His <i>coming</i>, but by the words, "Behold the <i>bridegroom</i>; go forth to meet him".<a name=244:7></a> It is not only that I know Him as the Head, but that I am in the sense of the relationship of the bride.<a name=244:8></a> Supposing a person came into this room and announced, 'Behold, the Bridegroom!<a name=244:9></a>' what an effect it would produce!<a name=244:10></a> How we should all immediately adopt what we think would suit Him!<a name=244:11></a> I am going to meet Him.<a name=244:12></a> My waking up to this fact and my going out to meet Him necessarily create in my heart the desire to suit Him.<a name=244:13></a> He does not terrify you; he does not threaten judgments on you; but He counts on your heart.<a name=244:14></a> The cry is 'Behold, the Bridegroom!<a name=244:15></a>' This at once awakes us, and, as we go to meet Him, the practical effect is, that we seek to be what will suit Him.<a name=244:16></a>

		The first thing after I have learned what Christ is for me in His work -- after I have seen that He has accomplished everything as to the putting away of my sin before God, and that I belong to the One who has accomplished it, as I was saying in the first lecture -- the first desire that then rises in my soul is, that I should be a manifestation of this Christ to whom I belong -- that I should be a body full of light.<a name=249:1></a> As we then saw, we have first the conscience relieved, next the heart satisfied (which we went into fully at that time), and, lastly, the body full of light.<a name=249:2></a> To-night it is the body full of light I wish to speak to you on, and that, properly, is <i>consecration</i>.<a name=249:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I know the erroneous way in which this word is used, but I hope tonight that we shall see plainly what is the scriptural thought of it.<a name=249:4></a> In the margin, "consecrate" is translated "filling;" and I hope to show you the manner of it, what it really is, as we look at the way in which consecration is figuratively brought before us in the chapter I have read.<a name=249:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing we find is that Aaron and his sons are robed.<a name=249:6></a> Figuratively, afterwards, they go through the whole course of the work of Christ.<a name=249:7></a> There is the bullock, which is the sin-offering, burnt with fire without the camp, which, I trust, every soul here has learned: "He hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin".<a name=249:8></a> This is the groundwork of everything.<a name=249:9></a> Then I come to two rams.<a name=249:10></a> There is an identity between these two rams; understanding them, you will understand what consecration is.<a name=249:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus I am left down here on this earth, with no question as to my place up there; and it is Christ up there that is before me, and not either what I was or what I am in myself.<a name=250:16></a> "Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: they shall walk, O Lord, in the light of thy countenance".<a name=250:17></a> It is there that I am according to my Father's pleasure.<a name=250:18></a>

		Turn to <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12">Romans  12</a>.<a name=251:15></a> Here we read: "I beseech you therefore brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service".<a name=251:16></a> People read this, and fancy that they are giving God something; but this is not the fact at all.<a name=251:17></a> I will explain to you what it does mean, by turning to chapter 7.<a name=251:18></a> Here you find that you have the new nature, but you have also with it a very

		Hence consecration is not that I have given Him anything, for I have nothing to give.<a name=252:11></a> People talk of consecrating their talents, their property, and so on, and I know in a certain sense what they mean; but the fact really is, that I put aside everything in me which would hinder the expression of Christ flowing out in me, that the life of Jesus may be made manifest in my body.<a name=252:12></a> For this the apostle prays in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3">Ephesians  3</a>, "that Christ may <i>dwell</i> in your hearts:" the true force of the word is <i>domicile</i>.<a name=252:13></a> That He may so dwell there that we "may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height" of God's own favour -- the full scope of blessing; "and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God".<a name=252:14></a> Christ is that fulness, and having Him thus dwelling in the heart is real consecration.<a name=252:15></a> Such a

		The last evening we were upon the subject of consecration, which, as we saw, consists in simply receiving Christ, in having the hands full of Christ, and the heart full of Christ.<a name=261:1></a> It is not giving Him anything, for we have nothing to give Him; hence, as the apostle says, what is needed is "that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith".<a name=261:2></a> The believer is thus formed by Him for His own purpose.<a name=261:3></a>

		What comes next after this is, How is this consecration to be acquired?<a name=261:4></a> A person may see very plainly that what he needs is Christ, but how is he to find what he needs?<a name=261:5></a> The way to find it, and the way the Lord makes it known to the soul practically, is by dependence.<a name=261:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In Judges and Samuel this comes out very distinctly.<a name=261:7></a> In Judges everything has been tried in the way of restoring Israel from the state of failure and degradation into which they had fallen; the knife, the ox-goad, the nail, the lamps in the pitchers of Gideon, and lastly, the strongest man.<a name=261:8></a> But all had been a failure.<a name=261:9></a> And now we come to a new kind of power: Samuel is born.<a name=261:10></a> His mother, feeling the wretchedness of Israel, cries to the Lord; she is a woman of a sorrowful spirit; and the Lord gives her her petition: Samuel is born in answer to prayer.<a name=261:11></a> Thus he comes out from the first in entirely a new light: he is the answer of dependence upon God.<a name=261:12></a> In the chapter we have read we find him saying, "I will <i>pray</i> for you unto the Lord".<a name=261:13></a> I do not desire to interpret the passage, but merely point out that he prays, and that as the result, the Philistines came no more into the coasts of Israel, all the days of Samuel.<a name=261:14></a> This puts prayer in a very remarkable place.<a name=261:15></a>

		What is needed to keep us in His presence is practical dependence.<a name=264:1></a> See how it comes out in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#12">2 Corinthians  12</a>the apostle comes down from paradise, from not knowing whether he was in the body or out of the body, and what does he find?<a name=264:2></a> why that Satan is here, and that he has got flesh.<a name=264:3></a> What does he need then?<a name=264:4></a> I say, he needs to know the power of Christ down here as he knew it up there, and for that he must be as clear of his flesh down here as he was up there.<a name=264:5></a> People say, I was very happy in my room reading, and I came out and immediately lost my temper.<a name=264:6></a> The fact is you were trusting to your enjoyment of the Lord, instead of to the Lord Himself.<a name=264:7></a> I was in a scene up there where I so enjoyed Him, but, having come out to act down here, I find that I have this flesh, and I get wearied and put out.<a name=264:8></a> I have, then, to learn now that by dependence I can be free from all this down here, for I was free from it when I was in the presence of the Lord.<a name=264:9></a> That is the lesson I learn.<a name=264:10></a> I find the Lord sufficient to sustain me.<a name=264:11></a>

		If you turn to <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#14">Matthew  14</a>you will see there the way in which the Lord introduces us to the wonderful place of dependence in which He would have us.<a name=264:12></a> The Lord is here as rejected, and two things come out as the consequence: one, that He feeds the poor of the flock in the desert; the other, that He walks on the water.<a name=264:13></a> Upon this, faith leaves the ship that was made for water and walks with Jesus on the water.<a name=264:14></a> That is the place of dependence, that is the new ground.<a name=264:15></a> But are we to do that?<a name=264:16></a> Yes, there is no other place promised you here.<a name=264:17></a>

		The scripture is careful to tell us that he <i>did</i> walk; it was not in the majestic way that the Lord did, but he did walk, at any rate a little.<a name=265:10></a> Wonderful to see a person superior to circumstances wherein he himself is the thing that would sink him, but instead of sinking, superior to them all.<a name=265:11></a> Just look at Stephen; he could look up to the bright glory and was thus superior to the whole thing down here, his soul perfectly free to intercede for his murderers; a wonderful prodigy of divine power in a poor earthen vessel here; Christ's strength perfect in his weakness.<a name=265:12></a>

		When you come to act, you find you are in a scene from which you can get nothing, and the power for action must come from above.<a name=266:19></a> The Lord has gone to prepare a place for me, and says, I make you acquainted with the Owner of that place -- the Father; and everything you shall "ask in my name I will do;" it is <i>do</i> there.<a name=266:20></a> But it is only as I am dependent upon Him that I learn the goodness of Christ there in His own scene, and learn Him here in His power because of my need of it.<a name=266:21></a> It may be humbling to say so, but it is true, that the measure of the strength of any person in this room is the measure of the strait he has gone through with God.<a name=266:22></a> The water will not bear me up.<a name=266:23></a> Well, what sinks you?<a name=266:24></a> It is <i>yourself</i>.<a name=266:25></a> There is no acquiring of Christ,

		OUR MISSION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#84">Psalm  84</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We now come to the subject of "our mission".<a name=274:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two things which come out very prominently in the Psalm I have read: the first, our place <i>with</i> God; the second, our place <i>for</i> God; and these two hang together.<a name=274:2></a> I first have to learn what God is for me; if I do not know that I shall never know how I am to be for Christ.<a name=274:3></a> It is the root of the ignorance of many converted souls; they do not know what God is for them, and so their efforts for Christ are defective.<a name=274:4></a> Therefore it is a positive rule, that you must first know Christ for you.<a name=274:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This opens out very interestingly at the Lord's appearing for the first time in the temple on earth, as a little babe of eight days' old, greeted there by two saints.<a name=274:6></a> Simeon said, Christ is for me; now that I have seen Him let me depart in peace.<a name=274:7></a> Anna, on the other hand, now speaks of Him to all who look for redemption in the city.<a name=274:8></a> And these two states of soul should characterise all saints everywhere.<a name=274:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you wish to get the two combined in one person in a very matured way, you see it in <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#1">Philippians  1</a>.<a name=274:10></a> Paul goes beyond Simeon, and beyond Anna.<a name=274:11></a> He says, I have a desire to depart and to be with Christ, and that is greater than Simeon; but, To abide in the flesh is more needful for you, therefore I will remain, is more than Anna.<a name=274:12></a> Either <i>with</i> Christ or <i>for</i> Him.<a name=274:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, our subject for this evening is, What it is to be <i>for</i> Christ, or in other words, What is our mission.<a name=274:14></a> But, as I have said, if you have not learned the first point -- Christ for you -- you are not qualified for the second -- being here for Christ.<a name=274:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I shall first, then, say a few words on what is the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		origin of your mission; for how can any person be true to a mission if he has not got the origin of it?<a name=275:1></a> The psalm we have read starts with this: the psalmist brings us to the tabernacles of God, even before the bright light shone which has opened up our way into the holiest.<a name=275:2></a> The first blessedness -- "Thy house" -- is one unbroken scene of delight; everything there awakens praise.<a name=275:3></a> But, in the second I am in a scene of opposition, where it is a valley of tears; it is not heaven now, the courts of the living God; it is earth; and your mission, as you pass through, is to "make a well".<a name=275:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing to be clear about in the mission is the origin of it -- its starting point.<a name=275:5></a> "As my Father hath sent me, even so send I you".<a name=275:6></a> It is clear from this that you must be first out of the world; how else could you be sent into it?<a name=275:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And it is said to the <i>disciples</i>.<a name=275:8></a> It was "the disciples" who were assembled together, and to them He says, "Peace be unto you", as He sends them forth on their mission.<a name=275:9></a> When He said the second time, "Peace be unto you", it is that they may have peace in a double way; not only up there in a sphere of glory and praise, but also down here as they go about their work.<a name=275:10></a> That is the force of the second peace; it is the peace connected with the mission.<a name=275:11></a> He Himself as He walked down here had peace superior to the character of things around Him.<a name=275:12></a> He walked in peace, and He would have them do so too.<a name=275:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"As my Father hath sent me, even so send I you".<a name=275:14></a> This is the origin of their mission and of ours.<a name=275:15></a> You must first put yourself outside the world with Christ, that you may come into it for Him.<a name=275:16></a> It is then you know the origin of your mission.<a name=275:17></a> We shall presently come to the purpose of it, but we must first be clear as to the origin.<a name=275:18></a> It is from above, and given, too, to a person who comes from above.<a name=275:19></a> And this not to

		apostles either.<a name=276:1></a> I want you to see clearly that every one of us God has thus sent.<a name=276:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I know a scene outside this world -- a scene of unbounded delight in the Father's house: that is my home; but I have also a place of business down here in the world.<a name=276:3></a> A man is not settled who has not got a home; his character is formed by his home.<a name=276:4></a> And just so with the saints.<a name=276:5></a> If you do not come from your home above you will never be a good workman -- a good missionary here.<a name=276:6></a> I use the word mission, because it is true that every one of Christ's people is sent into the world to do some particular work that no other person can do.<a name=276:7></a> All the flowers in the garden are different, and so are all the stars in the sky, and they do not clash.<a name=276:8></a> If I look the whole sky over I shall not see two stars clash; each has its own sphere.<a name=276:9></a> And I believe if those who are sent from God were more distinct in their service, that they would never clash -- I mean as to imitation or envy.<a name=276:10></a> I ever find it the case that the man who is laboriously occupied with what God has given him to do, is never envious of any other man.<a name=276:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, then, first settle the fact that you have got a home with God, and then say, I am sent into this world from my home.<a name=276:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second question for us is, Whom am I going to serve now that I am thus sent?<a name=276:13></a> Having got my origin above, I find that I come into this world to make a <i>well</i>.<a name=276:14></a> It is to serve <i>man</i> that I come.<a name=276:15></a> And yet it is not to improve him; it is not patriotism and that sort of thing; it is not the amelioration of society I am occupied with, though my mission has to do absolutely with man.<a name=276:16></a> I am to "do good unto <i>all</i> men".<a name=276:17></a> I do not think any servant of God would differ with me as to the fact that it is man I have to serve.<a name=276:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then comes a great question: What would be the character of this service?<a name=276:19></a> As I say, I come

	<div class="paragraph">
		from heaven, and that more distinctly even than an angel does, for I am saved by grace, united to that One who sends me, and have thus reached the consummation of His finished work.<a name=277:1></a> Having eaten the passover, and been at Gilgal, I come forth a fit person to be a channel of mercy to this poor world, as we find it in <a href="../bible/John.htm#7">John  7</a>"He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water".<a name=277:2></a> It was the feast of tabernacles -- what answers to the harvest home in this country.<a name=277:3></a> Man was the object of God then on the earth, celebrated in this feast; all had been gathered in, and men rejoicing in the good gifts of God were found dwelling in booths.<a name=277:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then on the last day, that great day of the feast, typical of that time spoken of by the prophet, "with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation", Jesus stood and cried, saying, "If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink".<a name=277:5></a> The great thought in the feast was that man was the object of God upon earth, and Israel commemorated this fact.<a name=277:6></a> But now, the Lord says, I will produce in you a far greater thing than this feast celebrates; man, instead of receiving from the earth -- instead of being contributed to by it -- shall contribute to his fellows on the earth; instead of seeking water for his thirst from this scene, out of man himself blessing shall be ministered: "out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water".<a name=277:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Just think of it for a moment.<a name=277:8></a> The Lord announcing, When I am glorified, instead of blessing the earth and man through it, I will give to my people the Holy Spirit, flowing out of them for blessing.<a name=277:9></a> Nothing can be more wonderful than that I am sent into this world of misery, to be in it a <i>well</i>.<a name=277:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having then seen the origin of our mission, and that man is the object of it, the question arises, How am I to serve him?<a name=277:11></a> and this is where, among christians,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=278>[Page 278]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		there is a great disagreement.<a name=278:1></a> One thought is, that I serve him with what is called charity; and "charity" is doing for him what pleases him.<a name=278:2></a> One gives a penny to a beggar, and calls it charity.<a name=278:3></a> Charity, then, is ministering to a man where he himself thinks that he requires it.<a name=278:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the divine idea of charity is that, when I serve, I serve according to the nature of Christ Himself, and that which I minister when thus serving is Christ Himself.<a name=278:5></a> Suppose I go to see a widow and orphans, I might console them immensely by what always consoles a bereaved heart, by telling them how the departed one idolised them and so on, and they would be wonderfully consoled by that; but it would be only by what exalted themselves; it would be all natural.<a name=278:6></a> I asked some one the other day, "Would you like to be sympathised with as you naturally feel, or as you ought to feel?<a name=278:7></a>" The answer is simple.<a name=278:8></a> Thus the Lord, when He sympathised with a bereaved heart, brings Himself, a divine Person, into the terrible chasm that death has created, and consoles the heart with Himself.<a name=278:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The great point is, What do you minister?<a name=278:10></a> Nine-tenths of the reasons why people fail in their ministry is that though they are occupied with man, the right patient, they are not ministering the right thing to him; they are doing what no doctor allows, anyhow not till the patient is quite prostrate, and that is doing for him what he likes -- what suits his tastes.<a name=278:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next thing is, that there is a definite service for each, and each should know what his service is.<a name=278:12></a> In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12">Romans  12</a>, <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2">1 Corinthians  2</a>, and <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4">Ephesians  4</a>, gifts are treated of; the difference between the three being, that in Corinthians it is the body; in Ephesians, it is Christ, the head of the body; and in Romans, it is the individual responsibility.<a name=278:13></a> In Romans we begin with prophecy, which is the

		highest gift in one sense, and we end with "showing mercy with cheerfulness" -- something that is within the reach of every one.<a name=279:1></a> Could not every one of you show mercy with cheerfulness?<a name=279:2></a> Do you, any one of you, think that you are outside the hallowed circle?<a name=279:3></a> You are not.<a name=279:4></a> And, let me tell you, I would sooner have the last without the first, than the first without the last.<a name=279:5></a> I would sooner show mercy with cheerfulness than prophesy; the highest moral quality is the gift common to all.<a name=279:6></a> We can all have this, though as I say, there is a special service for each one of us; something distinct, something definite within the reach of every one of us, so that we may not clash; and, as it has been said, if the Lord has a service for you, you will never be happy until you are doing it.<a name=279:7></a> And this service, if it be but to give a drink of cold water to some one, must be done according as Christ would do it.<a name=279:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not say that you must be always speaking to some one or other.<a name=279:9></a> You may be an old person like Anna, though indeed, as for Anna, she went about a great deal, speaking to all them in Jerusalem who looked for redemption.<a name=279:10></a> But whatever may be your service, you can anyhow show mercy with cheerfulness,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two spheres in which we serve, and in these two spheres every person can judge in a measure as to what is his mission.<a name=279:11></a> The one is corporate; the other, individual.<a name=279:12></a> In all my individual service I never lose the fact that I belong to Christ's body on earth.<a name=279:13></a> No one can interfere with my individual service until in it I do something which interferes with my place in the assembly.<a name=279:14></a> An evangelist says, Oh, I may go and preach anywhere that I choose!<a name=279:15></a> And so you may; but if in your preaching you say anything that is wrong, you will offend against Christ and against the assembly, and the assembly, or those in charge, will pull you up about

		it.<a name=280:1></a> Thus there are the two circles, the individual and the collective.<a name=280:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the former, I will take any sphere you like.<a name=280:3></a> For instance, the position of a child in a family, or that of a wife; some one under control.<a name=280:4></a> How shall such know their mission?<a name=280:5></a> Well, it is a very delicate point, and requires great wisdom and holy care lest, while trying to do Christ's service, you clash with the ordinance of God.<a name=280:6></a> I say to a child or wife, In doing what God calls you to -- in carrying out your mission -- be careful that you do not go against the ordinance of God.<a name=280:7></a> Perhaps some one says, But this is very difficult; how are you to do in the case of an unbelieving father or husband?<a name=280:8></a> I admit that it <i>is</i> very difficult, and if the clash comes, let not the subject one be the one to make it.<a name=280:9></a> As Christ's servant, I should not be the one to wish to bring it about.<a name=280:10></a> It is a matter which needs the greatest care.<a name=280:11></a> Whilst I insist strongly on your having a mission, and that Christ has sent you into the world to carry it out.<a name=280:12></a> I also insist that in doing so you respect the ordinance of God; and, until that ordinance so come in the way as to make it a question of obeying God rather than man, you must submit to it.<a name=280:13></a>
	</div>

		I will now go a little into gifts -- as to the way in which God prepares people for service.<a name=281:9></a> I trust I have made it dear that in one way each saint has a gift; to every one is given the gift of grace; and in the measure in which each receives this grace from Christ, so he walks.<a name=281:10></a> As to different paths of service, a man's ability in it will soon tell me whether the path he has taken be the one to which he is called or not.<a name=281:11></a> But, whilst I say this, I do not believe that a person is thoroughly fitted for his work before he takes it up.<a name=281:12></a> The Lord never employs a ready-made servant.<a name=281:13></a> If I engage a coachman, I make sure before doing so as to whether he is able to drive; I make inquiries as to his fitness.<a name=281:14></a> Not so the Lord.<a name=281:15></a> He acts in just the contrary way.<a name=281:16></a> He sets us to drive at once, without our ever having tried before.<a name=281:17></a> But, whilst He acts in this way, He still puts His servants through a period of <i>probation</i> before He gives them their work.<a name=281:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Of course, besides this, the Lord gives positive gifts to His servants.<a name=281:19></a> Saints sometimes ask, How may I know that I am gifted?<a name=281:20></a> Well, I believe, from looking at Scripture, that besides conversion, the Lord reveals Himself very distinctly to the soul that He

		We see the same line of things in Samson's history.<a name=282:5></a> He had been a Nazarite from his birth, but it was a special time at which "the Spirit of the Lord began to move him at times in the camp of Daniel"

		It is a moment of immense importance to the soul of the servant when God thus reveals Himself to him -- when he gets what I call his <i>base</i>.<a name=282:10></a> This is a military term used for the spot at which the general keeps his resources, his ammunition, his reserves; on which he falls back in case of need, and from which he works.<a name=282:11></a> What is the base of the servant?<a name=282:12></a> It is the distinct revelation from God to his soul that he has a special support from Him in his service here, and a servant is never established until he has this base, on which he falls back in time of need.<a name=282:13></a>

		these that I have mentioned -- that of Isaiah.<a name=283:1></a> We are told that he had the word of the Lord, and the vision, up to chapter 6; but then, he is not thoroughly established; he cries "Woe is me, for I am undone!<a name=283:2></a>" when he gets into the presence of the Lord of hosts.<a name=283:3></a> He has not got his base.<a name=283:4></a> But here he learned that he had to do with God in His glory -- in that glory which He was about to withdraw from Israel -- and then he "saw his glory and spake of him".<a name=283:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And I might even go on to the Lord Jesus Christ Himself, and see how He fell back upon His base in the midst of all that was disappointing here, as He said, "I thank thee, O Father"; "even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight".<a name=283:6></a>

		It is difficult to tell how evil is communicated from one to another, whether in physical or spiritual things.<a name=286:10></a> The most learned of men cannot tell you how a pestilence is carried; and just so when there is a satanic virus abroad, we cannot tell how it is communicated.<a name=286:11></a> But the word of God tells us how we may find the antidote for it.<a name=286:12></a> In Timothy we find two things given us as a safeguard by God.<a name=286:13></a> First, "my doctrine": "Thou hast fully known my doctrine".<a name=286:14></a> And, second, "Thou hast known the holy scriptures".<a name=286:15></a> Christendom has certainly over looked <i>one</i> of these; it has separated them from each other.<a name=286:16></a> The better part of christendom insists upon the scriptures as a great thing, but they have

		To present my thought more easily to the comprehension of all, I turn to John's gospel, because he always prepares the saint with moral power for Paul's teachings.<a name=287:3></a> In that way he is a wonderful one to assist us to understand Paul.<a name=287:4></a> You never find a man who has fairly got hold of Paul's doctrine that he has not also got hold of John's.<a name=287:5></a> Paul puts John's truth in the reverse order.<a name=287:6></a> For instance, Paul will speak of "the God and Father", while John gives us "Father and God".<a name=287:7></a> John's point is to set forth the Son of God on earth; Paul's to unite us to Christ in heaven.<a name=287:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 9, where we get the story of the blind man, we find him at the end alone with the Lord, who says to him: "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?<a name=287:16></a> He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?<a name=287:17></a> And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.<a name=287:18></a> And he said, Lord, I believe.<a name=287:19></a> And he worshipped him".<a name=287:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I do not wish to grieve a single soul, but I must state this positive truth, that you do not understand preservation or separation if you have not been first in this place of <i>solitude</i> with the Lord.<a name=287:21></a> Solitude is where there is "<i>no man</i>".<a name=287:22></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first of these solitudes you take sides against yourself; no man stands for you, and you cannot stand for yourself.<a name=288:10></a> As the thief said, "We indeed justly, for we receive the due reward of our sins".<a name=288:11></a> And who do you find in that solitude?<a name=288:12></a> The Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=288:13></a> This is an intolerable wickedness, say they of the woman; let us stone her.<a name=288:14></a> But being left alone, she finds herself in that solitude in the presence of the Lord and His word: "He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life".<a name=288:15></a>

		The whole body is to be "full of light".<a name=294:1></a> It is not, as we were saying this morning, that the <i>solitude</i> is the point, and the Lord Himself the <i>light</i> of that solitude; but it is in the light that there is fellowship.<a name=294:2></a> You cannot get a better illustration of fellowship than lighted lamps give us; all of them give light in the room, but none can say what light comes from this one or from that one.<a name=294:3></a> We have fellowship in the light, and nowhere else.<a name=294:4></a> People have a very mongrel kind of idea as to what fellowship is, You must be in the level morally in which another is, if you are to have fellowship with him.<a name=294:5></a> His disciples never had fellowship with Christ until He rose from the dead.<a name=294:6></a> Some continually confound sympathy with fellowship.<a name=294:7></a> When Jesus walked beside Mary to the grave there was sympathy, but there was no fellowship.<a name=294:8></a> Sympathy is a most wonderful thing; it is said you can take an illness from sympathy.<a name=294:9></a> Thus in His sympathy the Lord not only saw what we went through here, but He made Himself acquainted with the very nature of the suffering.<a name=294:10></a>

		But I must first call your attention to the fact that the church soon lost its place of light-bearer, because it soon lost Christ Himself as the object of the heart.<a name=295:2></a> It is impossible to have Christ for an object, and man not be set aside.<a name=295:3></a> It is not simply that a person is converted, as it is said, but as I am looking out for Him, the absent sun, I am deriving light from Him.<a name=295:4></a> The effect on the blind man on getting the light, was that he was not perfectly at rest till he got to Christ; and, as he imbibes Him, he becomes a light himself to others.<a name=295:5></a> You must keep up with Him as your object.<a name=295:6></a> If the earth come between the sun and the moon, there is no light from the moon.<a name=295:7></a>

		I call your attention to this trimming of the lamps.<a name=297:10></a> I hear some singing about the coming of the Lord, and all the while they go on without changing one single thing in themselves or their associations, expecting the Lord to set all to rights when He comes.<a name=297:11></a> But I beg to state that when the Lord appears He will call the saints to account for the state in which He finds them, though, true enough, whatever that state may be.<a name=297:12></a> He will at the rapture cut every string that binds them to earth and take them away to Himself.<a name=297:13></a> It is not at His coming for them, but at His coming <i>with</i> them, that it says "He may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father".<a name=297:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#12">Luke  12</a>, which I now return to, there are three marks of the person who thus goes forth -- of the one who is really looking and waiting for the coming of the Lord.<a name=298:12></a> The Lord expects the saint not to give up the thought of His return.<a name=298:13></a> Where there is affection the thought of the return of an absent one is as natural to us as it is to look for the return of the sun after the night.<a name=298:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But while saying this, I will add that I do not press the Lord to return.<a name=298:15></a> As I look around I cannot but see that things are not in a fit state for Him; and, though I do not expect <i>things</i> to get better, I do expect the <i>saints</i> to.<a name=298:16></a> I cannot press Him to come whilst I see everything so unfit for Him -- so unprepared for Him.<a name=298:17></a> I do say that if every one thought this was his last day he would work as he has never done before.<a name=298:18></a> I am sure Elijah never did such a day's work as he did that last day.<a name=298:19></a> I think the Lord will have a Bethany on earth when He comes, as He had when He went.<a name=298:20></a> Are we preparing for Him?<a name=298:21></a> The apostles all speak of His coming, but each in quite a different way to the others.<a name=298:22></a> John takes the bride's side of it; Paul takes the Lord's; Peter the flock's;

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first great mark of waiting for the Lord is that you are "not afraid of them that kill the body".<a name=299:3></a> This is beautiful.<a name=299:4></a> The moment I come to fear God I find I fear not man, for He cares for me.<a name=299:5></a> Stephen is a very good example of this.<a name=299:6></a> He says: I have not any fear at all.<a name=299:7></a> Fear of the holiness of God's throne?<a name=299:8></a> no; I am at home there.<a name=299:9></a> Afraid of man's rage?<a name=299:10></a> no; I am superior to the whole of it.<a name=299:11></a> They batter me; those whom you would least expect to; but I am not afraid of them that kill the body.<a name=299:12></a> Stephen is the practical expression of a person able to stand out against man.<a name=299:13></a> And he does not talk of the way in which the Lord sustains him in the trial; he never speaks of himself at all; he thinks of others -- kneels down and prays for them.<a name=299:14></a> He is a body full of light.<a name=299:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And what grows out of all this is confession.<a name=299:16></a> "Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God".<a name=299:17></a> We all know how imperfectly we confess; we all know how a stranger hinders us.<a name=299:18></a> But I do say this, as it may help some, that you never can tell another -- you never can tell an audience in preaching -- the wonders of God's love, if you have not first confessed them to Himself.<a name=299:19></a> Would there not be a great difference between the account of a man who told you the story of the battle of Waterloo, having himself been present at it, and that of one who only knew it from hearsay?<a name=299:20></a> You would find out at once that the former had been there because he would describe it from the spot on which he himself had stood.<a name=299:21></a> You always colour a thing from the place in which you are yourself, and so everything depends on your apprehension of where Christ is.<a name=299:22></a> If you see Christ coming out from under the judgment of God, <i>that</i> is what you have got.<a name=299:23></a> If you see Him rising and gone up to heaven at God's right hand, <i>that</i> is what

	<div class="paragraph">
		Is confession what characterises us?<a name=300:4></a> If I have been saying it to the Lord in private I can now go out and say to all the world that He is everything to me; I must say it to them, if only to gratify my heart; nothing else would satisfy it; I must let men know that there is One I delight to honour.<a name=300:5></a> Love likes to make much of its object at its own loss.<a name=300:6></a> Mary brought her alabaster box of ointment -- that which would have signalised her as if she were a person of importance, and breaks it on His head.<a name=300:7></a> He does not command it from me, but my love gives it.<a name=300:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But this confession must go on; it must be <i>continuous</i>.<a name=300:9></a> As a merchant would say, you must extend your business if you wish to preserve it; so the christian is ever called to greater suffering, greater responsibility.<a name=300:10></a> It is not that he can retire; no, it is more and more work until He comes.<a name=300:11></a> The soul is never right unless it longs to go to Him.<a name=300:12></a> Individually I long to go to Him; collectively we long for Him to come.<a name=300:13></a> It is one of the saddest things, I know, that some should have contented themselves with making one great break at first at their conversion, and then from that time out never another single confession.<a name=300:14></a>

		The second mark is that I have no care: "Take <i>no</i> thought for your life".<a name=300:15></a> There is no fear without, no care within.<a name=300:16></a> Having no fear leaves your <i>body</i> free; having no care leaves your <i>mind</i> unfettered; this is the great point in having no care.<a name=300:17></a> "Seek ye the kingdom;" that is my occupation in a world that has refused Him altogether.<a name=300:18></a> I see no place for me at all except in my own house; I have even qualifications for care of the church as I rule my own house; it is the only place in which I can uphold the kingdom of God.<a name=300:19></a>

		CHAPTER 1
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before entering on the study of the book of Joshua, it is of importance that we should see that it was the purpose of God, even in the land of Egypt, before a step was taken, to bring the children of Israel into the land of Canaan.<a name=303:1></a> If we turn to <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#3">Exodus  3</a>, we read: "And the Lord said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows; and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them out of that land <i>unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey</i>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that mission Moses did not accomplish, and here we see Joshua has to complete it.<a name=303:2></a> He is the saviour; he accomplishes the work which, Moses being dead, now takes a new turn.<a name=303:3></a> Salvation comes out.<a name=303:4></a> It is not uncommon in Scripture thus to find the mission of one servant accomplished by another.<a name=303:5></a> In this way Elisha fulfils Elijah's, and Paul, Stephen's.<a name=303:6></a> Thus Joshua comes in to accomplish that of Moses.<a name=303:7></a>

		It is part of God's thought about me that I should have heaven.<a name=303:8></a> It is not a thing that I shall become entitled to at some future time; I am <i>now</i>.<a name=303:9></a> Joshua only really leads me into possession of that which is mine already.<a name=303:10></a> It is true I <i>have</i> to possess; but before possession I must have <i>title</i>.<a name=303:11></a> So in the first few verses we find God encouraging Joshua as to his title to the land; it is "the land which I do

		Canaan is properly, if I may use such an expression, an <i>earthly</i> heaven.<a name=304:3></a> The children of Israel were going on to it through the wilderness.<a name=304:4></a> As for us we are now in the Canaan of which theirs was the type, and which we get in Ephesians, where we are "blessed with all spiritual blessings in the heavenlies in Christ;" and we are going on to the true Canaan.<a name=304:5></a> We have now the figures of the true; we are in the antitype of Canaan; of course heaven is not the antitype of it.<a name=304:6></a> It is God's kingdom on the earth.<a name=304:7></a> The moment I take God's ground on earth I am on heavenly ground.<a name=304:8></a> This is just what makes the difference between the wilderness and Canaan -- that I am standing for <i>God</i> now; I am taking possession, so to speak, for God.<a name=304:9></a> This is Ephesians.<a name=304:10></a> In Hebrews the saints are going on through the wilderness, to Canaan; and they wanted to go back and to make earth the religious place.<a name=304:11></a> It is to extricate them from that snare that Hebrews was written.<a name=304:12></a> You easily get the difference between Hebrews and Colossians if you put them together.<a name=304:13></a> In Colossians they are trying to make <i>man</i> religious; whilst in Hebrews they are trying to make earth a religious <i>place</i>.<a name=304:14></a> The moment you take your place in the race you are a heavenly man.<a name=304:15></a> The possession of Canaan to the Jew was that he had, as his own, "the land which the Lord thy God careth for; the eyes of the Lord thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year;" a land in which was everything that satisfied man naturally.<a name=304:16></a> So now that "the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit", I am filled with all that satisfies the spiritual man just as they had everything that satisfied the natural man; and I do not believe <i>any</i> one is satisfied who is not on God's

		Often people think that something has to be settled by their own death, but if so, it is clear that Christ's death has not been sufficient.<a name=309:6></a> His death has set me perfectly free.<a name=309:7></a> Whilst saints think that their own death has something to do with it, they never can get the sense that they are as dead in God's sight now as ever they will be.<a name=309:8></a> Death will not put me one bit more satisfactorily in the sight of God than I am now.<a name=309:9></a> In the Red Sea, everything is cleared away between me and God, but to see this accomplished in myself is an immense relief; and this is Jordan; the first is Christ's death; the second mine -- my entering into His.<a name=309:10></a> So the old commentators were literally correct.<a name=309:11></a> I must <i>lose</i>.<a name=309:12></a> Man is morally dead, and I say, I have done with man -- with the weak thing; it is gone.<a name=309:13></a> Thus, a person on a death-bed is perfectly happy; he is going to a new scene, and he has so entered into it, that he is morally superior to everything in this one; as to circumstances, he is in death; but, as to life, he has already resurrection life.<a name=309:14></a>

		To enter into death, then, without entering into the grave, can only be effected by my contemplating Christ in His death.<a name=310:5></a> I am to see the ark of the covenant go down into Jordan.<a name=310:6></a> And what do I see in this death?<a name=310:7></a> I see two things: I see Christ, the One who was everything that was lovely in this world, gone in death; but I also see that in death He was the One who was everything that was pleasing to God.<a name=310:8></a> So I have seen the end of everything that is beautiful on earth, and also of that which is perfectly well-pleasing to God.<a name=310:9></a> Let any one lose in death one much loved, and see what an effect it will have on him; the nearer the dead was to you, the more you enter into that death.<a name=310:10></a>

		The higher thing would be to turn to Jericho and say, I do not want the earthly things; but in Ai we see that we are allowed to have some of the spoil.<a name=337:5></a> It is not as it was in the early chapters of the Acts, where <i>no</i> one said "that ought of the things which he possessed was his own, but they had all things common", and where any who had "lands or houses, sold them, and brought the prices and laid them down at the apostles' feet".<a name=337:6></a> By-and-by we find this was not the case; it was, "every man <i>according to his ability</i> determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judea".<a name=337:7></a> And still later on the apostle charges "them that are rich in this world", It is not now a question of giving all up, but of consecration to the Lord.<a name=337:8></a> Still, a man might imperil everything here for the sake of the testimony; like Abram who went out by night with all his servants to rescue "his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people".<a name=337:9></a> No doubt Jericho is the brighter light, but with no less doubt is there just as much of divine power in the subjugation of Ai as of Jericho.<a name=337:10></a>

		But what is very remarkable is that Hebron also was the city that frightened all Israel and prevented their going up to possess the promised land.<a name=349:5></a> And it was "built seven years before Zoan in Egypt;" it was a very old city.<a name=349:6></a> Looked at in connection with Satan it is the place of fear -- of "wicked spirits in heavenly places", as Ephesians tells us.<a name=349:7></a> And this gives us a wonderful moral lesson: the place of the greatest difficulty becomes the place of the greatest victory; the place that was the stronghold of the enemy becomes the place the most distinguished by the power of Christ: "O death, where is thy sting?<a name=349:8></a> O grave, where is thy victory?<a name=349:9></a>" I die at Hebron as a natural man; it is the only way I can get rid of the enemy; and there where the grave was, is for the saints the rendezvous after battle; there faith triumphs.<a name=349:10></a> Where I die there I get the victory.<a name=349:11></a>

		There are two aspects of the gospel.<a name=369:7></a> There is the way it affects <i>you</i>.<a name=369:8></a> You say I have received great comfort; oil and wine He has poured in, He has healed my wounds; my poor heart and conscience are wonderfully relieved by the grace of God.<a name=369:9></a> But that is not all; if you stop there you do not speak of God at all; you speak of His goodness to <i>you</i>.<a name=369:10></a> If you limit yourself to that, you are limited to your own feelings about it, and the effect it has upon yourself only, and of the relief it has brought you from the terrible distress of a wounded heart.<a name=369:11></a> But the prodigal son says, My father <i>kissed</i> me.<a name=369:12></a> The first notice he had of grace <i>reaching</i> him, though not the first work of it he had, was the father falling on his neck and kissing him.<a name=369:13></a> When it comes to that side, what would such a soul say?<a name=369:14></a> He would say, Well, I know at least how my father feels; I know how he received me; I have the knowledge of the Father.<a name=369:15></a> So the very first action of grace towards the prodigal was to show him the will of the Father.<a name=369:16></a> This makes a very great difference between what he could say, and what the man who fell among thieves could say.<a name=369:17></a>

		The gospel tells me what a wonderful thing it is that God could meet my conscience; but also it conveys to me that there is a thought in the heart of God about an undeserving person like me.<a name=369:18></a> And there is this lack in many a one who can talk of the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To a soul that talks to me only of how happy it is as knowing the finished work of Christ, I can but answer, Well, that is all very well, as long as it is smooth water, but when it gets rough, what will you do?<a name=370:4></a> I can say I am anchored in the love of God, and, though I may swing on my moorings.<a name=370:5></a> I can never be moved, for I am in safe anchorage.<a name=370:6></a> All here comes to me from one spring, and that spring is the heart of God.<a name=370:7></a> You must connect your heart with the love and not with the benefit, otherwise you have not got established, I am not only clear of everything that was against me, but I am brought into a new kind of love -- the love of the Father.<a name=370:8></a> It is not merely His power.<a name=370:9></a> His greatness, but it is the knowledge of what He is in Himself to me: "I will declare it".<a name=370:10></a>

		Now, it is important for us to see how far we have entered into this love.<a name=376:3></a> No doubt the love is there, but when we enter into it is only when we in some measure enter into His own sphere -- there where there is nothing to hinder our acquaintance with Him.<a name=376:4></a> But we find that we are often occupied with a great deal that is connected with Christ and connected with ourselves, and yet that is not Christ.<a name=376:5></a> Of course, we are all at first occupied with the <i>service</i>, but it is a greater thing to be occupied with the One who <i>did</i> the service.<a name=376:6></a> The woman who touched the hem of His garment had an immense idea of Christ: she wanted to touch One who had not only such power for perfect blessing, but who also so delighted to communicate the blessing.<a name=376:7></a> "If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole".<a name=376:8></a> She had an immense idea of what He was -- of what God in His nature was; as it says, "He that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him".<a name=376:9></a> "If I may but touch his garment".<a name=376:10></a>

		I need not give any more examples; if you take these three classes and exercise your soul upon them, you will come to the simple conclusion that it all consists in getting near to Him, the great effect in every one of the cases is that man is <i>out</i>, and that Christ becomes the great and only joy -- the one singular object of the heart.<a name=383:7></a> You say, I know what a desperate thing my nature is -- how criminal, how unsuitable, and how desolate.<a name=383:8></a> Talk of not being criminal!<a name=383:9></a> I know I am.<a name=383:10></a> Talk of not being desolate!<a name=383:11></a> I know I am.<a name=383:12></a> Talk of not being unsuitable!<a name=383:13></a> I know I am.<a name=383:14></a> But He has been known in His love in each breakdown of myself.<a name=383:15></a>

		The great subject of this chapter is that we are here to represent Christ.<a name=386:1></a> It is not so much service -- indeed, service is not spoken of in the chapter -- it is that we are here to represent Christ.<a name=386:2></a> In the anticipation of His leaving the earth, the Lord, as it has been said, presents us as Himself before the Father, and then presents us as Himself before the world.<a name=386:3></a> He looks up to heaven before He speaks, and then sets forth that we should be His representatives where He is not.<a name=386:4></a> This is the greatest desire of His heart in leaving us here.<a name=386:5></a>

		We must first see that He has left the earth -- that He has been rejected, and is not here.<a name=386:7></a> This the soul must learn as a distinct truth before it can know what it is to be for Him here.<a name=386:8></a> "He came unto his own, and his own received him not".<a name=386:9></a> Both Jew and gentile rejected Him; the Jews said: "He ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God;" and He was delivered over to the hands of the Romans.<a name=386:10></a> As Peter says: He "was disallowed indeed of men".<a name=386:11></a> You cannot understand Scripture without seeing this, Many do not believe that Christ is rejected.<a name=386:12></a> so they think that human means and influence can he used in His service.<a name=386:13></a> If you believe that, you do not believe the world has rejected Christ; for you cannot expect the world to be the rejecter and the upholder of Christ at the same time.<a name=386:14></a> Honest, conscientious people say the <i>Jew</i> rejected Him, but the <i>gentile</i> did not; so we can use and make subservient

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a great and a solemn thing that we are here to represent Christ; it is a simple fact that ought to interest every heart.<a name=387:4></a> The Lord, going away from earth after having shown out the nature and character of His love, says, I am going to heaven, but I leave you here to represent me; and I can state that, by the power of the Holy Spirit, you are glorifying me.<a name=387:5></a>

		It is not a question of serving; a person on a sick bed who cannot serve at all can glorify Christ.<a name=387:7></a> Chapter 15 is service.<a name=387:8></a> This is not service; it is representation.<a name=387:9></a> You are here to represent Christ where Christ is not, as the full and true picture of what Christ is; and so the apostle says, "that I may <i>win</i> Christ".<a name=387:10></a>

		Scripture says that man, both Jew and gentile, rejected Christ.<a name=387:11></a> Power was committed by God to man -- to the Jew first, afterwards to the gentile; and at the time of the death of Christ it was found in the Romans' hands.<a name=387:12></a> This power, I may say, was a <i>downward</i> thing; it was given from God to man, and man used it to crucify Christ.<a name=387:13></a> This being so, God says to Him, "Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool".<a name=387:14></a> Man is thus utterly disqualified; and now, if Christ be to be maintained on earth, it must be by an entirely new power -- the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=387:15></a> And to that

		I now turn to chapter 14.<a name=388:2></a> Christ has been rejected by the power that man had; and now, consequent upon that rejection, and upon Christ sitting at the right hand of God, a new power comes in -- that of the Holy Spirit.<a name=388:3></a> All the Old Testament saints were born by the Holy Spirit, and yet God allowed them to use natural power in His service; not only such as King Solomon, when the people were in the land, but Daniel and others in Babylon.<a name=388:4></a> But Christ has now been rejected by man: all his resources were brought to bear against God's Son on earth; and now God maintains the saint on earth independently of everything that has pre-existed.<a name=388:5></a> I want to draw your attention to the character of it.<a name=388:6></a>

		The Holy Spirit came down to comfort my heart during the absence of Christ, so that a simple believer may say, I am entirely independent of the world -- as independent as the armed men outside Jericho were of the armed men inside.<a name=389:2></a> He comes down from heaven and takes up His abode in the soul, when it knows that it belongs to Christ.<a name=389:3></a> And this gives me power: "Because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts".<a name=389:4></a> You have got the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit never leaves the one in whom He takes up His abode.<a name=389:5></a> He may retire and let you feel that you have lost His support when you have grieved Him, and then you break down and do some foolish thing.<a name=389:6></a> So it is in their acts that saints always show out what they are.<a name=389:7></a> They may be able to talk very well, but it is in action that it comes out whether you have grieved the Spirit or not.<a name=389:8></a> If you have, He will, if I may use such a very familiar expression, "leave you in the lurch", when you come to act; but when you confess, He is ever ready to come to help you -- to restore your soul.<a name=389:9></a> So you cannot, as David did, pray "take not thy holy spirit from me", for, though you may grieve the Spirit, He will never leave you.<a name=389:10></a> The Holy Spirit fills the new bottle after creating it; first there was only the old bottle.<a name=389:11></a> There is great confusion in christendom as to this: the thought prevails, that He takes the old bottle and improves it.<a name=389:12></a> It is not so; it is a new creation altogether.<a name=389:13></a> As it has been well said, "He first builds the house and then dwells in it".<a name=389:14></a>

		There are three things in this scripture in which Christ is in relation to us.<a name=397:1></a> The first is, He takes away the sin of the world; God sent Him to take away everything that offended Himself.<a name=397:2></a> This is the groundwork of all in the soul; if it has not got hold of this it has not got simple confidence, but if it have, it can say, as we learn in another place.<a name=397:3></a> "As he is, so are we in this world;" we are not afraid of the judgment; as to the sin, we do not see it all taken away yet, but for us who believe it is taken away to faith.<a name=397:4></a> The soul never gets settled rest with God if it do not see that God has satisfied <i>Himself</i>; it is He who has "provided himself a lamb", it is not I who have done it.<a name=397:5></a> According to the levitical order they had to bring their offerings, and it is true that I come to the levitical side too; but it was not I who went and found Christ.<a name=397:6></a> I only appropriated Him; God provided Him; He sent His Son for Himself, and satisfied Himself in doing so.<a name=397:7></a>

		"A certain woman .<a name=403:9></a>.<a name=403:10></a>.<a name=403:11></a> was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse, when she heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment: for she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole".<a name=403:12></a> Now, mark you, there was a case of weakness, perfect powerlessness; every effort to get on, like <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>, but every effort only made her worse and worse.<a name=403:13></a> But she has faith in Christ; just a touch, and she is whole.<a name=403:14></a> Now it is all done, you say.<a name=403:15></a> But no, it is not all finished.<a name=403:16></a> But is she not cured?<a name=403:17></a> Yes, she will never get a bit better cured; the bottle is made, but there is something more to go on in the soul.<a name=403:18></a> I often see it in people: they know that there is a divine work done in their souls, but they have not had an interview with Christ, they do not know that they are united to Him.<a name=403:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the woman is cured, but the Lord has to bring out another thing in her: He says, "Who touched my clothes?<a name=403:20></a> .<a name=403:21></a>.<a name=403:22></a>.<a name=403:23></a> and he looked round about

	<div class="paragraph">
		to see her that had done this thing".<a name=404:1></a> Then the woman, "fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.<a name=404:2></a> And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole: go in peace;" and I believe if souls would go and tell the Lord, You are the only one I have to do with now, they too would "go in peace".<a name=404:3></a> Look at the fearing and the trembling that you see in souls, and some even think it is the right thing; it gives them the comfort that they have something new and divine.<a name=404:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To get positive relief there must be confession.<a name=404:5></a> You get the same idea in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#10">Romans  10</a>"If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved".<a name=404:6></a> I do not believe people are walking in the consciousness of salvation if they are not confessing Christ -- not confessing their <i>sins</i>, but confessing <i>His worth</i>.<a name=404:7></a> The more I am like a Jonathan confessing the worth of David, the more am I walking in the consciousness of salvation.<a name=404:8></a> There is always "the heart" and "the mouth": the inside and the outside.<a name=404:9></a> It is then she finds she is connected with Christ; she finds He has not only done a work for her, but He calls her "daughter".<a name=404:10></a> It is "Daughter, go in peace".<a name=404:11></a> She is acquainted with Himself; she says, I know not only what He has done for me, but I know I am His.<a name=404:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I turn to another point; that is, what it effects.<a name=404:13></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>-- I am not going through all the effects, but will merely just touch upon one or two -- He says: "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life".<a name=404:14></a> But there are two things in the christian.<a name=404:15></a> In Numbers it says they not only looked to the brazen serpent

		and lived, but there was God's well.<a name=405:1></a> He said, Come, and I will give you water; and they sing to it.<a name=405:2></a> There are the two things: life given by faith, and water given to sustain the life given.<a name=405:3></a> You have here a crucified Saviour, the Son of man lifted up; and I say, what then?<a name=405:4></a> Why, I have life.<a name=405:5></a> And what comes next?<a name=405:6></a> Why, "Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water, springing up into everlasting life", "Sing ye unto it!<a name=405:7></a>" and people <i>ought</i> to sing to it!<a name=405:8></a> And why should not <i>we</i> sing to it, and be filled with the Spirit?<a name=405:9></a> It is inexhaustible; there can be no failing of it, whilst on the brightest festive day the wine was out.<a name=405:10></a> There is man for you!<a name=405:11></a> But here in chapter 4, to a poor sorrowful woman who had done everything she could to make herself happy in this world, He says: I will give you something that will make you perfectly happy without your ever going outside of yourself; you shall "drink waters out of your own cistern, and running waters out of your own well".<a name=405:12></a> And yet with all this you find people murmuring, discontented, dissatisfied.<a name=405:13></a> The fact is, you do not "sing to it;" you are not, as the princes were, occupied with it.<a name=405:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another effect is that it makes you superior to man.<a name=405:15></a> You can worship; you have become another being; you have got into another state of things altogether.<a name=405:16></a> I have a fund in myself that is inexhaustible; I have a store filled with everything that I want for God and internal enjoyment.<a name=405:17></a> In the new bottle I have the new wine; and it is, "Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be <i>filled</i> with the Spirit".<a name=405:18></a> If I am, there will be melody in my heart to the Lord; and "melody" is a wonderful thing.<a name=405:19></a> It is not the mere chanting of a song, but it is the heart in full accord to Christ.<a name=405:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		practical effect of having the Spirit of God to which I attach a great deal.<a name=406:1></a> It is in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>"If ye, through the Spirit, do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live".<a name=406:2></a> We all know how we fail when we try to repress bad habits, cares, anxieties, worries of any kind.<a name=406:3></a> I try to repress a bad temper, but do I succeed?<a name=406:4></a> I find that my heart is like a river; repression only makes it swell the higher.<a name=406:5></a> I will take for an instance what every one would consider a very good man -- a teetotaller; he has repressed himself into good habits, but there is no virtue imparted.<a name=406:6></a> As has been said, "Sublimate the flesh as much as you will, it will never yield spirit".<a name=406:7></a> Repression is only the negative side.<a name=406:8></a> The teetotaller has repressed a bad taste, but he has not got a good one instead of it.<a name=406:9></a> You may pick up a weed, but that will not make a flower grow in the place of it.<a name=406:10></a> Self-culture represses bad habits, but in doing so it only makes the <i>will</i> stronger; it has only strengthened itself to repress the bad habit.<a name=406:11></a> If there were any good in you to come out it would be another thing; but there is not any virtue produced.<a name=406:12></a> Now the Holy Spirit will not only repress your bad habits, but will actually give you new tastes, so that a drunkard will love sobriety.<a name=406:13></a> He will not only not allow the bad thing, but will also put a good one in its place.<a name=406:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I turn to <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#6">Galatians  6</a>to show you what promotes the Spirit.<a name=406:15></a> In verse 8 you read, "He that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting".<a name=406:16></a> That is the way to promote it.<a name=406:17></a> It is well for us to study ourselves a little bit, for there is nothing more sure than that people reap what they sow.<a name=406:18></a> You say, I am going out for a day's amusement.<a name=406:19></a> Well, then, tomorrow you will be dull, and you will tell me you are depressed and do not know why.<a name=406:20></a> It is because you have been sowing to the flesh.<a name=406:21></a> If you had been sowing to the Spirit,

		waiting on the Lord, doing His will, do you think you would have been dull and depressed?<a name=407:1></a> But, you say, how am I to sow to the Spirit?<a name=407:2></a> Well, I find I have to check my mind constantly, to be continually watching myself, I think of such foolish things.<a name=407:3></a> Do you look upon the Spirit as a second self?<a name=407:4></a> and as a second self ever superior to yourself?<a name=407:5></a> I have now got the Spirit of God to be in me!<a name=407:6></a> It is the most wonderful thing!<a name=407:7></a> I do not think people at all estimate such a fact.<a name=407:8></a> And do I minister to that Spirit, or am I ministering to the flesh?<a name=407:9></a> As some one said lately of Noah, he did not mean to get drunk at all; he only wanted to indulge himself a little.<a name=407:10></a> I feel one has to be careful about everything, even to such a thing as reading the newspaper; if it comes to be a question of indulgence, you are solving to the flesh, and if you do you will reap corruption; any indulgence is sowing to the flesh.<a name=407:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And now just one word upon grieving the Spirit.<a name=407:12></a> We read in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4">Ephesians  4</a>"Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.<a name=407:13></a> And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption".<a name=407:14></a> A person who has grieved the Spirit is very like one who has never had it, but I have hardly time now for dwelling on the difference that there is between them.<a name=407:15></a> The fact of having grieved the Spirit often does not show itself until you come to do something, and then you find He is not there to support you.<a name=407:16></a> As it was with Samson: he awoke out of his sleep, and "wist not that the Lord was departed from him".<a name=407:17></a> The Spirit retires when He is grieved, as you get in the psalm: "Be not silent to me, lest, if thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit".<a name=407:18></a> Often when I have felt powerless I have said to myself, You have been grieving the Spirit, and you have

		not settled that grieving.<a name=408:1></a> What settles it is getting the feet washed.<a name=408:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now nothing can disturb my acceptance -- not all the weakness of the human heart; but the smallest thing disturbs my communion, and God will not let the smallest thing pass.<a name=408:3></a> He brings it up.<a name=408:4></a> He says, If you will not judge yourselves you must be judged; "for this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep".<a name=408:5></a> To me it is melancholy to see saints making much of themselves when they are under the chastening hand of the Lord, trafficking upon the sympathies of their brethren because they are suffering for their failures.<a name=408:6></a> There should be such an answer of divine grace coming out of the broken vessel that every spectator should be occupied with the grace instead of looking at the vessel.<a name=408:7></a> God may put a person in prison for his own good and for service too, and there is no greater prison than sickness.<a name=408:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, a very small thing grieves the Spirit of God.<a name=408:9></a> What a wonderful thing it is to be baptised with the Spirit!<a name=408:10></a> What resources I have in myself!<a name=408:11></a> If you understand it at all, <i>do not grieve the Spirit</i>, so that He may go on with you and help you, and that you may be able to say.<a name=408:12></a> I have a wonderful back, I have a wonderful power, though I have nothing but an "inn" here.<a name=408:13></a> The Lord lead our hearts practically to understand the magnitude of being sealed by the Holy Spirit.<a name=408:14></a>
