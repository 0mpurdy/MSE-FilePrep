	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the company who wait for the return of the Lord and will reign with Him here are described.<a name=14:7></a> There are seven traits, but they are not consecutive.<a name=14:8></a> A person has various traits, and these combined form the person; so it is here.<a name=14:9></a> They are not described in the order in which they are received, but in their moral order.<a name=14:10></a> The first is the word of God and prayer, set forth in Mary, who sat at His feet and heard His word (chapter 10: 39); and in the parable of the man who went to his friend at midnight for bread; chapter 11: 5 - 13.<a name=14:11></a> The true way to learn the word is to be really near the Lord, affectionately desiring His mind; and in prayer to be really cast upon God as your Friend, knowing that He can help you, and He only; so that you are absolutely confined to Him, assured that you will receive the greatest gift, thus indicating the immense gain from praying.<a name=14:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second trait is more external - YOUR BODY IS LIGHT (chapter 11: 34).<a name=14:13></a> The lamp of the body is the eye; therefore when thine eye is single thy whole body also is light.<a name=14:14></a> The whole body, your external appearance, is a contrast to the darkness here.<a name=14:15></a> You describe a line of light in the darkness, but in order to do this, there must be no dark part within.<a name=14:16></a> The light

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The characteristics of the body of light are described in chapter 12.<a name=15:4></a> You do not fear them that kill the body (verse 4).<a name=15:5></a> You "take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on" (verse 22).<a name=15:6></a> But you seek the kingdom of God, "a treasure in the heavens, .<a name=15:7></a>.<a name=15:8></a>.<a name=15:9></a> for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also" (verses 31 - 34).<a name=15:10></a> Your loins are girded about and your lights burning (verse 35); not only are you waiting for the Lord's return, but you are watching (verse 37); you are so vigilant during the night, and proving your assured expectation of His coming, that you are interested in the welfare of His household, and "give them their portion of meat in due season" (verse 42).<a name=15:11></a> In plain language, if you love Him that begat, you love them begotten of Him; <a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:1">1 John  5:1</a>.<a name=15:12></a> The more He is to you, the more His own are to you.<a name=15:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The third trait is in chapter 13: 16.<a name=15:14></a> - THE BODY LOOSED FROM THE POWER OF SATAN.<a name=15:15></a> The attempt to amend man by culture, "digging and dunging", had proved ineffectual, but the body of the believer is the Lord's.<a name=15:16></a> In apprehending and acquiring each of these traits, we must keep in mind that we have to confront and overcome the Jewish or legal element.<a name=15:17></a> On the earth the kingdom of heaven is a huge system in which the fowls of the air lodge.<a name=15:18></a> It is this externally, while internally all that was pure and simple is leavened.<a name=15:19></a> It is a narrow path now.<a name=15:20></a> Jerusalem, God's city, the Lord says, is desolate - "Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I say unto you, Ye shall not see me, until the time come when ye shall say,

		The fourth trait is THE GREAT SUPPER (chapter 14: 15).<a name=16:2></a> When one of the company said to the Lord, "Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God", the Lord, in reply, announced the great supper.<a name=16:3></a> The great supper is in the house; the Jew, and everyone with an earthly mind seeks for earthly blessings, and thus loses the supper.<a name=16:4></a> The work of the servant is to compel those in the poorest place and most abject circumstances in this world to come into the house.<a name=16:5></a>

		The fifth trait is THE STEWARD (chapter 16).<a name=16:12></a> When Christ's rights on the earth are disallowed, no one can have divine title to anything.<a name=16:13></a> All property is the "mammon of unrighteousness".<a name=16:14></a> You have no divine title to any property here.<a name=16:15></a> It is really the Lord's; but if you are His steward, and make friends of it by ministering to those in need, you will invest for the kingdom, the day when Christ's rights shall be acknowledged.<a name=16:16></a> The important fact is that riches are of value now only in proportion as they are expended in making friends, that is, in rendering service to others.<a name=16:17></a> It is the Lord's will that the rich man should have every needed comfort; this is His love and care for each of us; but the more the rich man spends in serving others, the more he lays up for himself a good foundation against the time to come.<a name=16:18></a> "Ye cannot serve God and mammon".<a name=16:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The sixth trait - AN OUT-OF-THE-WORLD CONDITION.<a name=17:1></a> The world is the greatest obstacle to the saint.<a name=17:2></a> It is man's organisation, and with legal religion, or the Jewish element, it is still more difficult to overcome.<a name=17:3></a> Faith only can say unto this sycamine tree (the wild fig), "Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea", chapter 17: 6.<a name=17:4></a> Hence when the ten lepers are cleansed by the word of Christ, only one by faith overcomes the world, and rising above every influence within and without, "turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God, and fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks" (verses 15,16).<a name=17:5></a> He was led into his true place in relation to Christ on the earth.<a name=17:6></a> He was really a stone of Christ's building.<a name=17:7></a>

		The seventh trait - SEEKING THE KINGDOM OF GOD.<a name=17:8></a> The snare in the present day is the same as in the days of Noah, and as in the days of Lot (chapter 17: 26); to be completely indifferent to the coming crisis.<a name=17:9></a> You cannot seek the kingdom of God if you are not expecting Christ to come and reign.<a name=17:10></a> There will be a very distinct separation between the two classes in that day; "the one shall be taken and the other left".<a name=17:11></a> The Jewish remnant will not be forgotten, as we see from the beginning of chapter 18.<a name=17:12></a> If you are of the kingdom, you are characterised in a twofold way: first, by being a little child (verses 16,17) - no antecedents, but absolutely dependent on God; the other, that you are not held by an acquisition here, but that you surrender all, even your own life, to follow Christ (verse 22).<a name=17:13></a> For everything which you have left for the kingdom of God's sake, you shall receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting (verses 29, 30).<a name=17:14></a>

		I want to show you the progress of grace in our souls.<a name=30:1></a> Peter was lending his boat to the Lord, just as much as one who has come to Jesus does now; they are willing to serve Him.<a name=30:2></a> But after the miraculous draught of fishes, Peter comes to another point.<a name=30:3></a> He discovers that he had come to God.<a name=30:4></a> This makes him say, "Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord".<a name=30:5></a> This is a Jewish experience, perhaps, but he learnt two things: the holiness of God, and his own uncleanness.<a name=30:6></a> But after the Lord's word, "Fear not" - what a change!<a name=30:7></a> "When they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him".<a name=30:8></a> This is the effect of first love, we give up for the Lord.<a name=30:9></a> In leaving all they got the Lord's company.<a name=30:10></a> Peter had learnt what the Lord's heart was for him, and he never lost this, for it never changes.<a name=30:11></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#21">John  21</a>, when in the boat with the other disciples whom he had led astray, directly he knew that it was the Lord he girt his fisher's coat about him and cast himself into the sea; he knew the heart of Christ for him; although his love had failed, the Lord's love was the same - unaltered, and he knew it.<a name=30:12></a>

		Now to turn to <a href="../bible/John.htm#6:67">John  6:67</a>, "Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?<a name=30:13></a> Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go?<a name=30:14></a> thou hast the words of eternal life.<a name=30:15></a> And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God".<a name=30:16></a> This connects itself really with <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>, but it is very important to know that <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#14">Matthew  14</a>took place at the same time as <a href="../bible/John.htm#6">John  6</a>.<a name=30:17></a> One gives our side, the other God's side.<a name=30:18></a> We have to go to the other side of death to reach Him.<a name=30:19></a> In <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#14">Matthew  14</a>Peter says, "Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.<a name=30:20></a> And he said, Come".<a name=30:21></a> He had the affection to take the step.<a name=30:22></a> The proof of love is that it wants the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But Joshua is still a learner.<a name=125:10></a> The next notice that we get of him is in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#11">Numbers  11</a>, where he misapprehends the mind of God.<a name=125:11></a> That very truth which had before saved him from defiling association, and preserved him in unison with God's mind, he would now make use of to circumscribe God.<a name=125:12></a> It is very important to remember that it is God Himself who is to counsel me and determine my judgment, and not any single line of His truth.<a name=125:13></a> To remain in the separated tabernacle was plainly the way of truth and blessing when Israel was in apostasy, but when Eldad and Medad prophesy in the camp, God's Spirit must be acknowledged, though they do not come to the tabernacle.<a name=125:14></a>

		We cannot but conclude that the Lord in complying with His disciples' request - "Teach us to pray" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#11:1">Luke  11:1</a>) - did so with full consideration of their state of intelligence at the time, and therefore the prayer was in accordance with that state; so that we may understand their state from the prayer which the Lord taught them.<a name=133:4></a> If suitable for their state at that time, before the death of Christ, and before the gift of the Holy Spirit, it must be evident that it could not be suitable after they had known the blessings of redemption and their union with the risen Christ.<a name=133:5></a> In this prayer there is a knowledge of the Father, because Christ was declaring Him on earth, but His will had not been yet done.<a name=133:6></a> Christ came to do His will, and now He has done it; so that we could not now pray for it to be done though it was right for the disciples to pray that it might be done.<a name=133:7></a> Besides, there is no knowledge of forgiveness of sins; it is looking for forgiveness on the ground of work rather than rejoicing in it.<a name=133:8></a> It is a prayer regarding man in the flesh rather than in the Spirit.<a name=133:9></a> Christ and the Spirit are in no way referred to in this prayer, and this is consistent, for Christ had not yet finished His work, and therefore does not lead their souls into it, and as the Holy Spirit had not come He finds no place in it.<a name=133:10></a> The prayer suited the disciples, and shows us where they were.<a name=133:11></a> If a soul now goes back to their state, then the prayer will suit it; but the soul using

		In the Apocalypse you get it fully; for then there is no need, there is no waiting to be filled first.<a name=151:9></a> There is ever a readiness to worship and even now I think we know in ourselves, feebly no doubt, how the soul is carried up to bow down and adore God as He is made known apart from and beyond the very blessedness which one needs; the blessedness is enjoyed, and the heart passes its engagements to Another outside itself, and this One is God!<a name=151:10></a> He worthily and duly claims this adoration from us, because He has made known His heart to us, and called us into fellowship with His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=151:11></a> In worship, God is our occupation, and this is very different from what the highest blessings can confer.<a name=151:12></a>

		EXCLUSIVENESS: ITS GROUND AND HISTORY
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The point of departure must be the point of recovery, and that invariably is the point most difficult to reach.<a name=191:4></a> One will admit and confess anything but the motive.<a name=191:5></a> The motive exposes the nature.<a name=191:6></a> Self-respect prevents me from allowing any eye to penetrate to my motive, simply because I know it will not bear the light, and if it were known, not my conduct or my ways (which might be considered, and often are, mere accident) but my nature would be exposed and condemned.<a name=191:7></a> No one is really humble unless he has lost self-respect.<a name=191:8></a> An honest man cares very little about the respect of others if he cannot accept it as his due.<a name=191:9></a> Hence there is really no humility until I am so entirely disappointed with myself before God that I can say with Job, "I abhor myself" (<a href="../bible/Job.htm#42:6">Job  42:6</a>) - I am a burden to myself.<a name=191:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The more thoroughly we see ourselves as God sees us, the more we turn from ourselves and rejoice in being in Christ, because there is a sense of clear distance from our nature; and the more through the Spirit we are conscious of this holy exclusion, the more susceptible we shall be of the little things which cause us to drop outside of this circle of life and peace.<a name=192:2></a> Reading a common-place book, listening to common conversation, will at times have the effect of connecting us sensibly with self, and in a way breaking open the closed doors of the chamber of horrors, calling up remembrances of selfishness and vanity, as traced in a landscape which has been hid from our view when in the sanctuary with Christ.<a name=192:3></a>

		Now if I can tolerate the apparent and what is openly reprehensible, it is evident enough there can be no deeper separation within.<a name=193:3></a> This is to me the secret cause of the misapprehension of exclusiveness more than this, it indicates the true principle for exclusiveness.<a name=193:4></a> No point of doctrine on mere independency, is of itself the principle for exclusiveness.<a name=193:5></a> The principle for it is that it offends against Christ, that it intrudes on that holy ground where the soul knows deliverance from condemnation and enjoys Him - the Deliverer, in His own life and surroundings.<a name=193:6></a> I maintain this in the inner circle in my own soul for light and peace.<a name=193:7></a> Nothing is spared that is not of the Spirit.<a name=193:8></a> All my rest depends on exclusiveness, and God here insists on it as due to Christ.<a name=193:9></a> His will is essential to my own enjoyment of Him.<a name=193:10></a> Then I allow not a particle of root; I must, for everything, be absolute about it.<a name=193:11></a> Well, then, if I am such an one, how can I go into the assembly gathered to Christ's name and for His presence, and tolerate there, not roots, for I do not see them, but branches, which indicate that there are roots of the flesh which I could not suffer for a moment in the inner circle, growing and developing themselves in the outer one without check or condemnation.<a name=193:12></a> Now to me it is plain that if the visible - the branches, could be tolerated, there has not been a real conscious exclusion of the roots in the presence of God.<a name=193:13></a> The soul has not known as yet the sweetness and gain of holiness that allows no intrusion from the noxious roots of the flesh; for if it had known this great gain there would have been no toleration of the open tangible development of it.<a name=193:14></a> If, I repeat, I can tolerate in the outer sanctuary what is but a variety of unrepressed flesh, how can I have known the claims of Christ in the inner sanctuary where none of it is admitted?<a name=193:15></a>

		THE TRUE SERVANT
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have been thinking a good deal of what sort of person the servant would be if he were really here for Christ.<a name=237:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A solemn place the servant is called to; he is to stand for God first, and then to act towards men.<a name=237:13></a> It is not so much what he does, as what he is.<a name=237:14></a> "Be a model of the believers, in word, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#4:12">1 Timothy  4:12</a>.<a name=237:15></a> Like a star in the sky - he is here for God.<a name=237:16></a> He may have his peculiar mission besides, may help people; but what is the calling and portion of every servant of Christ - of one called out for His service on the earth where He has been refused; and where He has sent the Holy Spirit?<a name=237:17></a> His beginning is to stand for Christ in the power of the Holy Spirit in the place where Christ has been rejected.<a name=237:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=238>[Page 238]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first great lesson he has to learn is what Christ is Himself in His own sphere.<a name=238:1></a> Hence he learns in the gospel of the glory that in Christ Himself are set forth all the attributes of God in a Man, that He is a Man in glory.<a name=238:2></a> It is there that the servant begins his acquaintance with Him, and as his acquaintance advances the servant enters into the greatness of His purpose; not only about everything of man, and this world, but to establish the glory of God everywhere.<a name=238:3></a> The Lord leads His servant, not only apart from this scene, where Christ is not, which is the wilderness, but he is made sensible of His absence, so that the world becomes a wilderness to him.<a name=238:4></a> Then the servant is conducted through Jordan into Christ's own sphere.<a name=238:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in Christ's own sphere he seeks the things above, and an entirely new day as Christ's servant opens before him.<a name=238:6></a> He not only knows Him in His own sphere, but the power and perfection of His grace are given to him from the Head of the church.<a name=238:7></a> The true servant is to express Christ here - to be the expression of his absent Lord.<a name=238:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When a man is first called out, he is often very earnest, but too often it is more for the truth than for the Lord Himself.<a name=238:9></a> This is where the weakness in all service has come in.<a name=238:10></a> The exposition of the subject of the grace of God, or of some truth, has been the aim, rather than the Person, and the consequence is, that practically, the servant is looking for supporters in his work, and counting his success by his followers, instead of having his heart as full as when he had only the Lord, and could say, No one stood with me, but I am standing here for Christ.<a name=238:11></a> When the servant has to do with people, he is affected by them in his private circumstances, etc.<a name=238:12></a> - he is not able to say he has set "his face like a flint".<a name=238:13></a> (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#50:7">Isaiah  50:7</a>) The true servant ought to be able to stand alone, like Paul in the storm (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#27:21">Acts  27:21</a>), and say, "Ye should have hearkened unto me".<a name=238:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=239>[Page 239]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For a servant to be here for Christ fully, he must be a man come from heaven; he must come from Christ; he cannot be above the power of Satan otherwise (see <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#6">Ephesians  6</a>), and he is not fully for the Lord till then.<a name=239:1></a> "Stand therefore" (verse 14).<a name=239:2></a> You may say how few there are of such!<a name=239:3></a> There is plenty of excitement about praying for the work, and as to setting the gospel before souls, but this is not the Person, nor is it the ability to stand for the Lord in a crisis.<a name=239:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When you see a man occupied with his preaching, it is the effect of his preaching he is thinking of, instead of seeing whether he has presented Christ so that souls should be absorbed with Christ.<a name=239:5></a> In order to do this he must be in the power of the heavenly Man, and free from what affects a man naturally; he must come from Christ, and have Christ before him.<a name=239:6></a> Christ must be his object if he is to present Him here; he cannot go beyond what he knows of Him; the servant can only express Christ as he knows Him, and he can only know Him as he is with Him.<a name=239:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As the church declined many sought place and power in the church.<a name=239:8></a> Then those who had learning, and who commended themselves to man, were appointed by man, and the one or two sent of God, the really devoted ones, were not recognised, but lost sight of.<a name=239:9></a> Thus the church became the huge system which we now see prevails.<a name=239:10></a> But the true servant is sent of God; it is not place nor position that he seeks, but to do Christ's work; and therefore while the mass of appointed ministers have only the safety of souls before them, none of them is set for the purpose of God.<a name=239:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This accounts for the solemn fact, that what ought to be the great aim of every servant is so little known.<a name=239:12></a> The servant himself is not in full power to set forth the heavenly Man until he is himself in the purpose of God for every believer; that is, until he knows that he is united to Christ.<a name=239:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=240>[Page 240]</a>

		Then he can stand for Christ above the whole force of this evil world; then he is practically a witness of Him, because he is superior to the power of the wicked one in the world.<a name=240:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The root of all failure in ministry is in overlooking the fact that you cannot set forth Christ but as you come from Him.<a name=240:2></a> The servant cannot express Him but as he knows Him, on the principle of "what hast thou which thou hast not received?<a name=240:3></a>" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#4:7">1 Corinthians  4:7</a>) You may know the words of the Bible and put them together well, but that is not the present ministry of Christ; it is not the real ministry of one who has come from Him.<a name=240:4></a> Putting thoughts together, making nice sermons, may be very instructive; but setting forth Christ is a different thing.<a name=240:5></a> To set forth the Person, as knowing His present mind, you must come from Him, you must know, not only what He was, but what He is.<a name=240:6></a> This is the reason that so much ministry wants definiteness.<a name=240:7></a> There is no aim, no line in it, because it has not been received as distinct instruction from Himself.<a name=240:8></a> A servant might explain a course of study of the word, or of doctrine, or of conduct - his own apprehension of the subject - and yet it might not be under the immediate direction of the Lord.<a name=240:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If a man comes from Christ he communicates something of Christ to the saints; any attempt at ministry apart from Himself only betrays that the servant does not know the great end of ministry - namely, God's purpose for every believer, that he should know that he is united to Christ.<a name=240:10></a> Therefore the great work of a servant is to lead souls into that.<a name=240:11></a> Until the soul realises that it is united to Christ, the servant's work is not done.<a name=240:12></a> Like Abraham's steward, he has to bring Rebekah to Isaac; then the believer moves about as a part of Christ down here, in His power and for His pleasure.<a name=240:13></a>

		The servant who enunciates truth may instruct souls, but it is quite a different service so to present the Person of Christ to you, that He is endeared to you; so that you rejoice to be united to Him.<a name=241:3></a> The servant's work is not done till then, nor is he accomplishing the purpose of God in his service, which is to bring Christ Himself more distinctly and effectively before the souls of His people, who thus become practically part of the bride, which with the Spirit calls upon Him to "Come" and reign here!<a name=241:4></a>

		THE WAY TO THE ASSEMBLY

	<div class="paragraph">
		Many truly desire to be in the assembly, but they have not found the only way to it.<a name=241:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The great work of God of late in the revival of truth has been to lead souls into a knowledge of acceptance with God - the greatness of God's acceptance of the believer.<a name=241:6></a> In fact, most christians of the present day do not get beyond assurance, and they who have found acceptance see that now they must be led by the Spirit and not by man; this has caused the separation from system in this century, and many think because they are separate from system that they are in the assembly: but this is very deceptive.<a name=241:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first step for those who have reached acceptance is that they seek to enjoy it, and the more they do so, the more they find that they cannot, unless they know deliverance, for it is realised in the Spirit.<a name=241:8></a> Now deliverance is very little known; when deliverance is known you realise that you are in the Spirit, and not

		in the flesh, Christ is your life and you find that He is not here, that you are in a scene where He has been refused; this discovery makes quite a new era in the soul, because as He is your life, the more you seek Him the more you discover that He is not only not here, but that He is totally rejected and refused in this world.<a name=242:1></a> No one can explain what it is to a soul to realise fully that he is in a scene where the One who is his life is rejected; he must shrink from the place and everything connected with it.<a name=242:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The whole effort of the pretentious organisation figured in the mustard tree is to give the impression that Christ is honoured here; this only makes the scene more trying to the true heart.<a name=242:3></a> In ordinary life the absence of one in your circle on whom you are dependent is deeply felt, but if he is violently refused a place how different the whole order of things here must become to you!<a name=242:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How must it affect you at every turn to see that the Lord who is your life is rejected from this world, and now you cannot make anything of yourself in a place where He is unrighteously disowned; everything opens out to you in a new and forbidding way as He who is your life - eternal life - is not only refused here but He is gone to another place, sat down at God's right hand in heaven.<a name=242:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now you begin to look for the assembly; then the assembly becomes a wonderful relief to the heart, to find He has a place here, not of the world or of its order: and being come to Him as the living Stone, you are built up as a stone in God's assembly.<a name=242:6></a> You have not only found a spot in divine contrast to all the contrariety and to all the assumption here, but a spot also apart from all here, and you spiritually are across the water on the other side of death and judgment.<a name=242:7></a>

		If we realise that He is not here, in no way could we reach Him now, but by the Spirit, leaving this place and going to His place.<a name=246:2></a> This is where the defect in saints is.<a name=246:3></a> People are ready to change from one place to another in this world if they can secure an improvement, but there is a great reluctance, even in saints, to leave it altogether for another region.<a name=246:4></a> The idea in christendom, founded on the supposition that Christ is here, is, that in going from one chapel or place of worship to another, you can get nearer to Him, whereas the fact is that He is not here, and you can only get to Him by the Spirit of God.<a name=246:5></a> It is on the principle of "If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink".<a name=246:6></a> (<a href="../bible/John.htm#7:37">John  7:37</a>) This is not going from meeting to meeting, but going to Him in the place where He is, to which the Spirit of God always leads you.<a name=246:7></a> It is only where He is that you can behold His personal glory, and it is there you are transformed into the same image.<a name=246:8></a> There you have communion with Him.<a name=246:9></a> It is easy to see what a change it would make to us all if we realised that we can only reach Him in His own place by the Spirit.<a name=246:10></a> When He comes into our midst it is from His own place to administer to us, not to remain in this place with us.<a name=246:11></a> It is a great thing to ascertain what is before the heart.<a name=246:12></a> Is it the desire to find something, or is it simply the desire to reach the Person from whom everything comes?<a name=246:13></a> It is a new day to your soul when you realise that Christ is the source of everything, and that it is from Himself you must draw, and not from ministry about Him.<a name=246:14></a> Many can explain Scripture and even apply it, who are not under the power of it themselves.<a name=246:15></a> They have not

		The first thought of every true heart ought to be that Christ is not here, and no record of what He has said satisfies the one who wants to be in possession of His mind at this moment.<a name=247:5></a> We hear varied opinions about a given matter.<a name=247:6></a> If you really felt that the Lord is not here you would not venture to give an opinion until you had gone to Him.<a name=247:7></a> You might look at the Bible or go to the Synopsis to see how a thing ought to be done, but that is not getting under the influence and impress of His own presence.<a name=247:8></a> Doubtless He would send you to the scripture.<a name=247:9></a> You might go to it without His sending you, but then you would not be under the same impression, and you would miss the vigour and fervour of His presence.<a name=247:10></a> This is an immense cheer to me.<a name=247:11></a> In general we read Scripture, not looking for communion with Him, but looking to understand what He communicates.<a name=247:12></a> We are not looking to see how He entered on what He communicates, and what it was to Himself.<a name=247:13></a>

		We will now look at communion with God in His works from the beginning.<a name=248:6></a> The more anyone contemplates the Lord's mind at the beginning in the garden of Eden, and the final issue of it all, the more fully will he apprehend the greatness of God's counsel at the commencement.<a name=248:7></a> It would not be only taking a superficial glance at the great intention at Eden, but if he apprehended the greatness of God's counsel, he would be a living exponent of the solemnity of it.<a name=248:8></a> If a person were able to impart to another his acquaintance with realities which are beyond human vision, what a wonderful effect it would have!<a name=248:9></a> It would impart a weight which no human learning could supply.<a name=248:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, if we go on from Eden to the deluge, we are introduced to another range of thought.<a name=248:11></a> Man had become so intolerably bad that there was no remedy for him.<a name=248:12></a> How little a passing reader, however minutely he reads and studies it, can conceive the immense range that is opened out before the soul in the history of the deluge!<a name=248:13></a> Man made in the image of God is become so corrupt that there is no remedy for him, so God removes him, and then He brings in One who is able to bear the judgment resting on man and to rise out of it, so that God can not only remove the judgment resting on man, but He supplants him by Another!<a name=248:14></a> In removing the man that has offended, God substitutes the Man who has done His pleasure in every thing.<a name=248:15></a>

		If one thinks of what it is for a man to be made in the image of God, it is no wonder that he should be elated at the greatness of his origin; and therefore, man's intense unwillingness to part with the man of the first order.<a name=249:1></a> No one heartily parts with the first man - with himself, until he makes the painful discovery that in his flesh dwells no good thing; and that the Man who died for him is the One who has borne the judgment for him, and is the spotless Son of God.<a name=249:2></a> So that not only is the offending man brought to an end in the cross, but every believer has a new beginning of the order of Him who is risen from among the dead, and who is the Man of God's pleasure.<a name=249:3></a> "For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive".<a name=249:4></a> (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:22">1 Corinthians  15:22</a>) After man is typically removed in the deluge, Noah is set up in favour and in power (in consequence of the offering up of the burnt-offering) on the same earth, where after the old order man is intolerable.<a name=249:5></a> Who can take in, or be in company in any measure with the mind of the Lord in this great work, and not take his place here on earth as one so deeply affected by it, that he looks at and regards everything in a divine light?<a name=249:6></a> He cannot be thoughtless or trivial in his connection with this world.<a name=249:7></a> No one could be in communion with God as to the scene of man's fall, and the greatness of his redemption out of it, who would not be affected in his life and conversation beyond what any learning could give.<a name=249:8></a> To be in communion with Him would give a light and intelligence beyond all creative knowledge, for it would be divine.<a name=249:9></a> We see in the final issue that those who are not redeemed will endeavour to seize upon the earth in simple usurpation, just as it was after the deluge, when Noah's descendants began to build a tower which was to reach to heaven, hoping to be in pure independence of God.<a name=249:10></a>

		OUR MANNER OF LIFE HERE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A christian's life on earth is the most peculiar one.<a name=258:8></a> He is the object of the love of God, that from its immensity and power can secure everything good to its object, while on the other hand a christian is exposed to the most trying circumstances here.<a name=258:9></a> Until we distinctly understand that we are born of God, and also born of the flesh, we shall never understand this great contrariety.<a name=258:10></a>

		If a christian would begin here, as simply a child of God, looking for nothing but what came from God, he would find how thoroughly he is the object of His infinite love.<a name=258:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As a rule, christians want God to minister to the man in the flesh; they judge of His love by their circumstances.<a name=258:12></a> For instance, if he is poor, he would like God to make him rich; but if he turns to God, He makes him happy in his poverty.<a name=258:13></a> If he cannot sleep, thoughts of God come with such freshness to his soul that he is better off than if he were asleep.<a name=258:14></a> Thus born of God and poor, you may be supremely

		happy; whereas, if you are seeking to be rich or to make yourself comfortable, it is not the love of God you are looking to, but that He should minister to your own selfish desires.<a name=259:1></a> If a man is very poor he has more occasion to look to God, whereas if he has means he has what may divert him from dependence on God.<a name=259:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The one thing for a christian is to find out the clear path in which to do God's pleasure.<a name=259:3></a> It is not whether he has the means, but whether it is God's pleasure for him to use the means.<a name=259:4></a> It is not our wants that cause our trials, but our using earthly means to alleviate our wants, instead of the heart turning to God for alleviation.<a name=259:5></a> It may be asked - why does God give means to some and not to others?<a name=259:6></a> I always find that means are a test to every christian.<a name=259:7></a> If you have the means in your hand, of course you are at liberty to use them; but the secret is whether you use them according to God's purpose for you, or according to your own tastes and desires.<a name=259:8></a> As a rule, I believe that any christian who judges himself will find, if he studies the course of things carefully, that it was his use of means that had got him into every trouble and disappointment, and in the end it was God that had to get him out of the trouble, as much as if he had not had the means to use.<a name=259:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have found after a lengthened experience, that the very thing one has most desired, if attained by human means, actually ends in bringing about the very sorrow which one desired to avoid, and which one would probably not have had if one had not had the power to gratify one's desires.<a name=259:10></a> Hence I see that the use of means is the test as to whether one is cast on God or on human methods.<a name=259:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		You have to begin with the fact that you are an object with God.<a name=259:12></a> If you do not begin with this, you become an object to yourself, and I believe the great value of having means in this world, is to show how one can waive present gratification in order to serve

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Judging of God by what He is, I should say a man dependent on Him without means would, in the long run, be as well cared for as a man with plenty of means.<a name=260:3></a> I believe there is no happier path for a man than to be dependent on the Lord from day to day for support through his daily work.<a name=260:4></a> It is right for him to have daily labour, and it is happy for him to be satisfied with it in dependence on the Lord.<a name=260:5></a> It is better than having private means, or being dependent on anyone but God.<a name=260:6></a> A missionary who could work with his own hands "the thing which is good" in dependence on the Lord would, I believe, have a happier time than one who was dependent on the gifts of others.<a name=260:7></a>

		The "work of an evangelist" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#4:5">2 Timothy  4:5</a>) might be your duty, and you could look to the Lord for your remuneration; the whole secret is whether you are doing your duty - "If any man does not like to work, neither let him eat".<a name=260:8></a> (<a href="../bible/2Thessalonians.htm#3:10">2 Thessalonians  3:10</a>) The question is whether it is to the Lord you are looking for support and supply; your daily labour may be your duty, but if the demands of the Lord's service call for it, you certainly must give up daily labour; yet that man will surely come to sorrow, who does not work as hard in the Lord's service as he would in his secular calling.<a name=260:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The first step in the soul after new birth has two parts: one, believing in the work of the cross, and the other, believing in Christ risen from the dead and now in glory (having borne the judgment of God upon man); and the Spirit is received, who assures him of God's reception in Christ.<a name=261:2></a> And next, by another action of the Spirit, he knows that he is in Christ, and that he is as to himself free of the flesh that cannot please God.<a name=261:3></a> There are many who believe in the work of Christ who do not know that they have received the Spirit of God, though through the grace of God they are perfectly safe, but they have no power until they have learned the twofold action of the Spirit of God in them.<a name=261:4></a> They have not consciously a bond with Christ personally.<a name=261:5></a> The one who has known this twofold action of the Spirit, can truly say, "I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me".<a name=261:6></a> (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:20">Galatians  2:20</a>) Until this is known and realised there is no true knowledge of Christ in you or power for walk.<a name=261:7></a> When you know that Christ is your life He is endeared to you in a new and peculiar way; already He is endeared to you by His work, but now by His life, and this is made known to you by the Spirit of God.<a name=261:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the light breaks in upon you that He who is everything to you is not here, and therefore the world is a wilderness to you - He has been refused in this world and has been called of God to His right hand.<a name=261:9></a> If you accept Him as your life, you must follow Him to where He is, and you will have the sense, because you have His life, that He is rejected here, but that you can enjoy Him where He is in His present exaltation.<a name=261:10></a>

		Thirdly, when the christian knows that Christ is his life and that his life is not here, he comes to Him as the living Stone in the assembly, where he finds Him in His divine greatness in the holiest of all, above all the power of evil here.<a name=263:8></a> There, in that exclusive place, he learns His mind, and His present interest, and is enabled to "show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light".<a name=263:9></a> (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:9">1 Peter  2:9</a>) Now the believer who has not advanced beyond the knowledge of Christ's work on the cross, though he is saved, has not found his place in the assembly, and consequently he has no knowledge of Christ's present mind and interests on the earth, but he is occupied with the official rule of the visible church.<a name=263:10></a> The more devoted anyone in system is, the more he seeks to maintain due order in the house of God from the bishop down to the curate, but you will remark that he has to do with office and not with gift.<a name=263:11></a> Gifts must come direct from the Head by the Spirit.<a name=263:12></a>

		"WHERE THY TREASURE IS, THERE WILL BE ALSO THY HEART"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have been struck lately, that, as far as I can judge, saints are not aware how much they lose by being diverted from the place where Christ is.<a name=264:2></a> One is very ready to say that Christ is one's treasure, but there is a positive proof that it is so, viz.<a name=264:3></a>, that our heart is in the place where He is.<a name=264:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I desire to call attention to the importance of the place.<a name=264:5></a> It is not that the christian has no duties or engagements here, but when he is attracted by the natural beauties here his heart is diverted from Christ's place.<a name=264:6></a> One slowly learns this.<a name=264:7></a> If we look at ourselves historically, we are in the place where He is not, where He came to His own and His own refused Him.<a name=264:8></a> Now we all know that He is gone to another place, and while many a heart is fixed in turning to Him there, there is often great loss because it is attracted by some of the things in this present scene.<a name=264:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I see it is of great importance to get definitely before you that if your heart is much taken up with an object, the heart does not content itself with its affection merely, but it desires to be in the place where its object is.<a name=264:10></a> Ruth says, "Intreat me not to leave thee".<a name=264:11></a> (<a href="../bible/Ruth.htm#1:16">Ruth  1:16</a>) We are in the place where Christ is not, and He who is our life is not here, and the more we realise that He is our life the more we enjoy Him when drawn to Him where He is.<a name=264:12></a> Hence, practically, this was the teaching of the wilderness.<a name=264:13></a> Nothing was to be found

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Anyone who truly judges himself when he is interested with fields or flowers must feel that he has been diverted from the place where his treasure is.<a name=265:6></a> If he has a garden he has to attend to it, but attention is a very different thing from attraction.<a name=265:7></a> One is a duty, but the other is the drawing away of the heart.<a name=265:8></a> Surely it is plain to everyone that if we were more occupied with the place where Christ is, we should be more weaned from the influence of present things.<a name=265:9></a> I have long insisted on heaven being our place, but I find now that you must get attraction there, and if He be your treasure, your heart will be there also.<a name=265:10></a> One cannot help remarking that as a rule those we meet with speak of something nice and to be admired here, instead of being able to refer to something where He is, as if their interests were here and not there.<a name=265:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I need hardly add more, but one thing in conclusion I must press, that union with Christ is realised only as you are led by the Spirit to Him where He is, and also that growth depends on your looking on the things that are not seen.<a name=265:12></a> Our inward man is renewed day by day, while we look not at the things that are seen, but at the things that are not seen.<a name=265:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We see in the beginning of the new company in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10:39">Luke  10:39</a>; <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#11:1">Luke  11:1</a>, the first trait - the word of God and prayer - literally what God says to us, and what we say to Him.<a name=270:5></a> The disciples say, "Lord, teach us to pray" in chapter 11, and the Lord figuratively sets forth in the man who went to his friend at midnight how prayer begins, with the sense that my friend has what I want.<a name=270:6></a> It is not so much a question of what the want is, but I know my friend has what I want, and that he is my friend; and I repair to him to relieve me of my want, without taking into account the various things which might intervene.<a name=270:7></a> One thing is fixed in my mind - that he has what I want, and that I have nowhere else to get it; this is the first great sense of prayer - absolute dependence on God, and His infinite ability to meet what I require.<a name=270:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The sense so peculiar to real prayer is that the greater our need, and the more we need, the nearer we seek to get to Him as if the only chance and the only hope of relief is our being with Him.<a name=270:9></a> The circumstances we are in generally impart a character to our prayers; so you will find that if you begin with the troubles about

		you, and keep on praying, you are getting more free of the trouble, and really getting more occupied with Himself; just as in the parable in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#11">Luke  11</a>, the man succeeds at last, and gets more than he asked for - an intimation of what the Lord says in the end, "How much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him".<a name=271:1></a> (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#11:13">Luke  11:13</a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we were to hear the prayers which are uttered, we should have an idea of the circumstances which gave rise to them; but the nearer we get to the Lord, the more we feel dependent on Him, and the more we get occupied with Him, instead of with the circumstances.<a name=271:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We get an interesting illustration of this in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14:14">1 Corinthians  14:14</a>, the man praying with his spirit; though he does not know what he is praying for, he is in spirit impressed by the association he is found in; in spirit he speaks mysteries (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14:2">1 Corinthians  14:2</a>), because of his nearness to the Lord.<a name=271:3></a> The nearer we come to the Lord, the more spiritual our desires are; we can account for prayers which take in our circumstances, being suggested by the circumstances, and not by our association with the Lord.<a name=271:4></a> Here we learn a truth of deep importance (where many, wishing to be spiritual, have failed, not having entered into the magnitude of the truth) - that we are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, and we cannot be in both at the same time.<a name=271:5></a> If you are in the Spirit you (by the Spirit) mortify the deeds of the body; you are not only preserved from the deeds, but you are dead to the desires of the flesh.<a name=271:6></a> The Spirit lusteth against the flesh, "so that ye cannot do the things that ye would".<a name=271:7></a> (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#5:17">Galatians  5:17</a>) Hence we see the great advance in the character of prayer; the more you are apart from the flesh and from the natural man, the more you are occupied exclusively with and derive from Christ Himself.<a name=271:8></a> Anyone may notice in a prayer meeting the difference between the two; the prayer that is occupied with things suits the mass; but it is a

		happy day when one learns that the nearer he is to Christ, the less he wants anything but Christ; that though still in human circumstances, he can thank God that he is not only free from the man that is contrary to God, but that he is in the Spirit, and as he walks in the Spirit he is absolutely free from the old man.<a name=272:1></a> When Paul was severed from Jerusalem, he had to learn in the ship (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#27">Acts  27</a>) that he was not to be directed by any providence or human influence, but by God Himself, outside everything here.<a name=272:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing has to be noted, that when prayer reaches to this, your dependence on Christ becomes more and more necessary to you, like the infant that cannot bear to leave its mother, not only because its wants are met, but she is the source of its supply.<a name=272:3></a> Now He so absorbs your heart that it is true of you that to God you are beside yourself, and, like the queen of Sheba in the presence of Solomon, you have no more spirit left in you; and as to prayer, you have the double blessing - the peace of God in coming to Him as touching things here, as we read in <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#4:7">Philippians  4:7</a>; and you have also what we get in <a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:14">1 John  5:14</a>, the sense of what His present will is - the sense of His will, as one in constant intimacy with a friend gets his mind without being directly instructed in it.<a name=272:4></a> This necessarily gives a peculiar and intense spirituality, and as union is realised it deepens, so that the one great desire of the soul is the prayer in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3">Ephesians  3</a>.<a name=272:5></a> Like Rebekah, your one desire is that you might be a comfort to Him who has brought you to Himself.<a name=272:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I cannot conceive anything greater to a heart that knows union with Christ than to be ever seeking to be in keeping with His pleasure, and though occupied with His glory on the earth, you rise, as you see in <a href="../bible/Habakkuk.htm#3">Habakkuk  3</a>, from "Shigionoth" (variable notes) to "Neginoth" (stringed instruments).<a name=272:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing is to receive the Holy Spirit after you have believed.<a name=275:9></a> It is important to note that there may be a long interval between these two.<a name=275:10></a> The apostle said to the Ephesian disciples, "Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed?<a name=275:11></a>" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#19:2">Acts  19:2</a>) The Holy Spirit was not given until Christ was glorified, and no one receives the Holy Spirit till he believes on Christ, who has been raised up into glory.<a name=275:12></a> "In whom also, having believed, ye have been sealed".<a name=275:13></a> (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:13">Ephesians  1:13</a>) The first effect of the Holy Spirit being received is that you can look up to God in confidence, even though you may be still unsettled about your state and other things, yet you feel you can turn to Him.<a name=275:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		When God gave promises to faith, while there was the obedience of faith, there was answer to the promise, so that the subjective state became the proof that the promise was of God, as we see remarkably in Abraham's case.<a name=279:8></a> He "believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#4:3">Romans  4:3</a>), and he proved experimentally his faith in God forty years afterwards when he offered up Isaac, a remarkable evidence of his dependence upon God, and of his obedience of faith.<a name=279:9></a> See <a href="../bible/James.htm#2:21">James  2:21</a> - 23: "Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?<a name=279:10></a> Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?<a name=279:11></a> And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness", etc.<a name=279:12></a> He not only believed that the promise came from God, but he gave a most wonderful evidence of his faith in the God of promise by the experimental obedience in which he proved it.<a name=279:13></a> When Israel had lost faith, there was no answer in them to the promise of God.<a name=279:14></a> They had been carried down into Egypt (figuratively the world), and there became

		We see all through how God was for them, which is the objective; on the other hand, we see how few answered to His grace with experimental ability to enjoy it, which is the subjective.<a name=280:6></a> It may be reasoned here that man had not then received the Spirit, and therefore was not able to answer to God's purpose; still we see very plainly how God expected a practical course corresponding to His grace.<a name=280:7></a> If we study the prophets we see how Israel failed to answer to the grace of God; the objective was perfect, and continued, though at times there was no subjective, no answer to it in the people.<a name=280:8></a> The great plaint in the prophet Isaiah was, "What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it?<a name=280:9></a> wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?<a name=280:10></a>" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#5:4">Isaiah  5:4</a>).<a name=280:11></a> Again, in Jeremiah the Lord says, "my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water", <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#2:13">Jeremiah  2:13</a>.<a name=280:12></a>

		But christendom has departed from the purpose of God, and having no true idea of His grace, there has been the attempt to be subjective according to human ideas, adopting the law as a rule of life; for where the objective is lost, the subjective must be imperfect.<a name=281:4></a> Hence we see the varied attempts in the godly to recover lost ground ending in confusion and extremes the one contenting themselves that all is done by God, and thus losing sight of the work of the Spirit in us - the subjective effect on our side; the other ignoring or limiting the objective, or God's purpose for us, and thinking that by persistent doing and religious exercises we may arrive at what will please God.<a name=281:5></a> Not knowing in themselves that the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made them free from the law of sin and death, they try to improve themselves - to make themselves more fit for the eye of God, instead of seeing that they are before Him "in Christ".<a name=281:6></a>

		When christendom departed from the truth that the grace of God had conferred all on us, and had become leavened by Judaism, some had zeal though not according to knowledge, in attempting to establish their own righteousness, but did not submit to the righteousness of God; hence the objective being little known (which is true of christendom to this day), the subjective must be unknown or imperfect.<a name=281:7></a>

		But I must add that when the knowledge of the objective - the fulness of God's purpose in grace, was restored to the church during this century, many received it gladly; but the effect on some was that because God had done all for them, there was no claim that they were to be in moral correspondence to it; the purpose of God in grace was accepted, but the work of the Spirit in them to enable them to answer to that purpose was overlooked; consequently instead of commending the greatness of God's grace which they knew objectively, they accepted this knowledge of His grace, without the experimental state that could enjoy it.<a name=282:1></a> This could only result in earthly-mindedness; and in union with Christ not being known and realised, so as to come from Him, and so to maintain His name in heavenly power on the earth.<a name=282:2></a>

		No one can read the epistles and John's gospel in the light of the Spirit, without seeing that the great burden of them is that Christ should be formed in the saints, so that they might be able to enter experimentally into God's grace.<a name=282:3></a> If we look at the objective we have everything in Christ, but there is no fruit unless we abide in Him.<a name=282:4></a> In John's epistles the great point is, "now, little children, abide in him".<a name=282:5></a> (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:28">1 John  2:28</a>) This has nothing to do with looking in on yourself, because the first experience on Christ being formed in you is that "our old man is crucified with him".<a name=282:6></a> (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:6">Romans  6:6</a>) "If Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness .<a name=282:7></a>.<a name=282:8></a> .<a name=282:9></a> but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live".<a name=282:10></a> (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:13">Romans  8:13</a>) This is all experimental, bringing us into personal acquaintance with the life and power of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=282:11></a> Souls are deceived by separating the subjective from the objective.<a name=282:12></a> God bestows the gift of His grace, and by His Spirit He fits every believer for the enjoyment of His grace.<a name=282:13></a> It is impossible for a person walking in the Spirit not to be in a divine state to enjoy the grace given, just as the prodigal received

		I believe the great hindrance to divine joy in the soul arises from the imperfect way the crucifixion of the old man is apprehended.<a name=285:2></a> The believer at first, for full peace, believes that God has raised from the dead the Lord Jesus Christ, who bore the judgment which lay on him, so that the man that was under judgment is really gone from the eye of God in judgment.<a name=285:3></a> The believer is now before God, not in the man who was under judgment, but in the Man who has glorified God in bearing the judgment; and consequently, there is not a cloud between his soul and God, because the man who caused the distance has been removed in judgment.<a name=285:4></a>

		Often a believer, though tasting of peace with God when he finds the working of sin in him tries to correct it as if he could alter himself, overlooking the great and stupendous fact that God Himself has removed the man in judgment in the death of His own Son He has laid help upon One that is mighty - His own arm brought salvation - and if a believer is really at peace with God it is because his old man has been crucified with Christ, and altogether set aside in judgment on the cross.<a name=285:5></a> If he were clear as to the fact of our old man being crucified with Christ, instead of trying to correct himself, he would look to Christ to

		THE NEW MAN
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In seeking light from the Lord on this important subject, we must first be absolutely clear of the thought which is so general in christendom, that God's Son became a Man in order to repair and rehabilitate the first man - the Adam race.<a name=291:1></a> Many years ago it was said that man was broken china, but that Christ was like perfect china.<a name=291:2></a> This was absolutely denied by the most godly man of the day.<a name=291:3></a> 'Christ was not china at all', but unique, a Man of His own order, and in His death the first man is clean set aside in judgment, and the new man is therefore according to God.<a name=291:4></a> Consequently we must not be deceived by thinking that the human mind can form an idea of any trait of the new man, or that it can imitate Christ, though many read the gospels with this object.<a name=291:5></a> Thus we start on this enquiry, looking entirely to God in order to understand the Man of His pleasure.<a name=291:6></a> "That holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:35">Luke  1:35</a>) - "the express image of his person" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:3">Hebrews  1:3</a>) - "the beginning of the creation of God".<a name=291:7></a> (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:14">Revelation  3:14</a>) As another has said, the difference between Him and us is that with Christ all His springs were in God, whereas our springs are in ourselves.<a name=291:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We know from the types that in the meat-offering the fine flour was not only anointed with oil, but it was mingled with oil, the Spirit of God, for Christ the One typified was conceived by the Holy Spirit.<a name=291:9></a> "Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death".<a name=291:10></a> (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:14">Hebrews  2:14</a>) He bore the judgment due to the first man and righteously removed him from the eye of God; so that it is not in Adam that the believer appears before God, but in Christ.<a name=291:11></a>

		LIGHTS IN THE WORLD
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a great favour of the blessed God through our Lord Jesus Christ, that we should each be individually a light in the world where we have been darkness and contributing to it: "For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:8">Ephesians  5:8</a>), and this independently of the candlestick which is the corporate light.<a name=294:1></a> Now, when the candlestick is removed, our responsibility is, if anything, greater that we should answer individually to the grace which He has given us.<a name=294:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Light is a remarkable quality; it sets forth everything in its true colour according to God.<a name=294:3></a> It begins with each of us personally.<a name=294:4></a> "If .<a name=294:5></a>.<a name=294:6></a>.<a name=294:7></a> thine eye be single", (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#6:22">Matthew  6:22</a>) set on Christ, that is, if Christ is your object, having no part dark, the body is light; you come out personally in quite a new way.<a name=294:8></a> It is not merely what you say, but what you are.<a name=294:9></a> A man who has received light, by degrees finds out how little he has seen things according to God.<a name=294:10></a> As he walks in the light the things that he could admit of at one time he cannot admit now.<a name=294:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first great action of the light as we see in <a href="../bible/John.htm#9">John  9</a>is to separate us from man's ideas about God, until in the solitude of light we enjoy the Lord Himself as the source of it.<a name=294:12></a> Thus the first mark of light is in relation to God, and how we are here suitable to Him.<a name=294:13></a> We have to learn that mere religious associations which are not in the Spirit do not suit Him, and are not according to light; this is the first great action of the light - separation from everything that does not suit God in our approach to Him, and as this is arrived at, we come out in a new way in our natural and home circle.<a name=294:14></a> Things are avoided and separated from that at one time seemed harmless and allowable, but the more we understand the new position we are in, the greater
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=295>[Page 295]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the sense of our responsibility to maintain the distinctness of this great favour, and this we are encouraged to do in dependence on the Lord, that we may be according to the mind of God, not only in the assembly, but also in our own private circle.<a name=295:1></a> It is as we are true in the latter that we influence those around us.<a name=295:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is remarkable how a person, looking for light, will be attracted by a person that has light; but the more he is attracted to him who has the light, the more he will scrutinise all his ways and everything about him, in order to see if he is walking up to his light.<a name=295:3></a> Many years ago, after speaking on <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16">Acts  16</a>, a near friend of mine said to me afterwards: 'The address was liked; but', it was added, 'I wonder what sort of man he is at home?<a name=295:4></a>'
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I may call the third circle is that of the servant.<a name=295:5></a> If in any of his ways he indicates the corrupt tastes of the world, he is like a waster in a candle, he spoils the light and invalidates his influence, because he has a dark part - that is, a natural taste which he has not overcome in himself; it hinders him being an exponent of the light.<a name=295:6></a> This dark part is the real test to every christian, and is not removed by introspection, which is inspecting the old man and betrays ignorance of the beginning of the work of Christ.<a name=295:7></a> How can you inspect that which is removed from the eye of God?<a name=295:8></a> The dark part, the working of the flesh, is not removed by introspection, but by sowing to the Spirit.<a name=295:9></a> We all know what sowing to the flesh is, looking for some harvest to come from it.<a name=295:10></a> But it is important to bear in mind that souls, as they are set for the light, seek it, as we see if we look around that where there is light there is the separation that begins with God.<a name=295:11></a> I have heard a preacher say, who had a chapel of his own 'My converts do not stay with me more than a year or two; they go elsewhere to look for more light'.<a name=295:12></a> The Lord is pleased to give the light, and the light is here,
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and those who value it find it out, no matter how retired or unknown the person is.<a name=296:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The great characteristic of a servant who has light from God is, that he insists on positive truth, not that he overlooks the negative, but his great aim and object is the positive; for instance, he not only insists that the old man is removed from the eye of God, but he insists also on our acceptance with God, and that we are able to enjoy it by the Spirit.<a name=296:2></a> We are in Christ by the Spirit, able to enjoy our acceptance, as we see in the parable of the prodigal son.<a name=296:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is to be borne in mind that it is not so much what a servant says as what he is; because if there is a dark part in him it is sure to affect him, and to weaken his ministry "Having no part dark".<a name=296:4></a> (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#11:36">Luke  11:36</a>) No man's word is effective beyond the effect it has on himself; his own life testifies to the truth of what he ministers; a convert takes his colour from his spiritual father.<a name=296:5></a> A man might enunciate the truth from mere study, but one who is ruled by the truth himself becomes necessarily an effectual exponent of it; and if the light is opposed and refused, the resistance to it is always greatest where there is most need for it.<a name=296:6></a> "Every one that doeth evil hateth the light".<a name=296:7></a> (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:20">John  3:20</a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is true that one might assume to have the light when he has it not; the true and divine way of correcting him is not by merely opposing him, but by setting forth from Scripture what is the light, and this exposes his misapprehension, as Abel exposed Cain.<a name=296:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is easy to say to another, You are wrong, but it is a great thing to show him what is right, and you cannot substantiate it unless you are light yourself.<a name=296:9></a> Let us rejoice that the Lord is the light, and that if we love the brethren we walk in the light, and there is no occasion of stumbling in us; we shall be as "the children of Issachar, which were men that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to

		ATONEMENT AND RECONCILIATION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is important to understand the scriptural meaning of these two words.<a name=297:8></a> Every believer has, in some measure, apprehended the meaning of atonement; but very few, as far as I know, have entered into the light and fulness of reconciliation.<a name=297:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	<div class="paragraph">
		Adam sinned and came under the judgment of God, with all his race.<a name=298:1></a> Cain thought he could be in favour with God by means of an offering unto God - as we might say, by 'religious services'; while Abel was so sensible of the judgment that he knew there must be atonement, that he must be sheltered from the eye of God by the blood of the victim.<a name=298:2></a> Now this we see all through the Old Testament.<a name=298:3></a> <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#12">Exodus  12</a>gives us a very good illustration of it.<a name=298:4></a> Israel were all sheltered under the blood of the lamb, typical of that blood whose virtue is everlasting, and the smallest faith in the atonement now finds that the benefit is complete and everlasting.<a name=298:5></a> But, apart from reconciliation, there is no present enjoyment of the benefit; no service for Christ down here.<a name=298:6></a> Atonement does not go beyond shelter; as has been said by another, 'If you atone for a thing you keep it'.<a name=298:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All through the Old Testament we see that the man of faith was sheltered by the blood of atonement; but until we come to Christ, who terminated the man who offended in bearing his judgment on the cross, and in it glorified God where man had dishonoured Him, so that He was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, reconciliation had not fully come in.<a name=298:8></a> The word 'reconciliation' is used in the Old Testament incorrectly, whereas the word 'atonement' is never really used in the New Testament.<a name=298:9></a> Now many christians never get beyond the atonement; they have faith in the blood of Christ, and are thus sheltered in the eye of God; all the benefits of Christ's work are secured to them hereafter; that work has made their title sure to all the grace that has been secured by Him; but if they do not know reconciliation, they do not come out upon this earth in an entirely new way for Him.<a name=298:10></a> They may rejoice in their shelter but, like Israel in Egypt, they are still morally there, and they do not see that the power of death has been destroyed; they have not begun here on earth the heavenly journey

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now reconciliation is based on the fact that the man who dishonoured God is removed; but the Man who honoured Him in bearing the judgment of death has been raised from the dead to God's right hand in glory.<a name=299:3></a> If you only know atonement you do not get beyond <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3">Romans  3</a>; but when you see Christ risen from the dead, you have "peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:1">Romans  5:1</a>,2); this grace is summed up in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:11">Romans  5:11</a>: "we are making our boast in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom now we have received the reconciliation".<a name=299:4></a> The scope of reconciliation is detailed very distinctly in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:14">2 Corinthians  5:14</a> - 17: "For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: and that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.<a name=299:5></a> Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more.<a name=299:6></a> Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new".<a name=299:7></a> Not a vestige remains before the eye of God of the one who has offended Him; but the One who has glorified Him fills the whole scene, and every believer in Him knows that God's heart is toward him, as we see illustrated in the prodigal; the father runs and falls on his neck and kisses him - he is reconciled; and then as he enters into and enjoys this reconciliation, he begins to joy in God, he knows that he is in Christ before God, in the power and grace of Christ, as son of God and joint

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I may add now, in conclusion, that no one will enter into the fulness of reconciliation who does not understand the gospel of the glory as set forth in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#3">2 Corinthians  3</a>.<a name=300:3></a> There we find the contrast between mount Sinai and what we have at the present time one is a demand for righteousness from the glory of God, the other is the ministration of righteousness from the glory of God through our Lord Jesus Christ; so that the nearer we approach to the glory, the more we are assured of His righteousness in having us there.<a name=300:4></a> We get a good illustration of this in the dream of an old divine when he was learning the gospel.<a name=300:5></a> He dreamed that he went to the gate of a palace, and was so well received that he went in, and as he passed through each succeeding suite of rooms, he was still better received, until he reached the presence chamber of the sovereign, where he was received with acclamation!<a name=300:6></a> So the nearer we approach, the more assured we arc of welcome.<a name=300:7></a> We are not repelled by the glory like Isaiah (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#6">Isaiah  6</a>), but on the contrary, beholding the glory of the Lord we "are transformed according to the same image from glory to glory".<a name=300:8></a> (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#3:18">2 Corinthians  3:18</a>) Now, when we are in the enjoyment of this wonderful grace, it is very blessed to perceive that not only is all the distance removed, but the nearer we approach the more we know how righteously God can accept us, for righteousness is the bulwark of love.<a name=300:9></a>

		God had a purpose for His own from the flood.<a name=301:4></a> Man, though he accepted the purpose of God, became entirely diverted from it by making himself paramount, thinking of himself and of his own benefit.<a name=301:5></a> Thus it led to his ruin, instead of his blessing, as we see in the prodigal (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15">Luke  15</a>), who accepted the goods from his father, but went into the far country to enjoy himself.<a name=301:6></a>

		God gave Noah power to rule "And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth .<a name=301:7></a>.<a name=301:8></a> .<a name=301:9></a> into your hand are they delivered", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#9:2">Genesis  9:2</a>.<a name=301:10></a> But he could not rule himself; he used his power for his own gratification; and eventually we see in Babel that man used his power to build a tower, to be independent of God.<a name=301:11></a> When God called Abram out, under the distinct condition that he was not to have as much as his foot would stand on of the land which he should hereafter inherit, we find Lot accepting, and remaining in the place, and seeking possession in it; and even Jacob, returning after twenty years to the land, as soon as he is settled in it, he buys a parcel of ground, from whence he is driven by the discipline of God.<a name=301:12></a>

		Again, when Israel was brought with a high hand into the land, the simple condition which they were bound to fulfil was to cleave to Jehovah, and to drive out all the inhabitants of the land.<a name=301:13></a> This condition, which entailed incomparable blessing, they failed to fulfil; on the contrary, they made a league with the inhabitants.<a name=301:14></a> Thus they betrayed that their heart was

		Now when Christ came, the purpose of God was opposed from the very outset.<a name=303:2></a> The nearer God comes to man, the more man shows his antagonism; and eventually he says, "This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours".<a name=303:3></a> (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#12:7">Mark  12:7</a>) Man wants the earth without God.<a name=303:4></a> But here I must add the blessed fact, so fully corroborated in our Lord's time, that anyone who follows out the purpose of God according to God's mind is manifestly supported by Him, as we see from Abram down, be it a Gideon, or a Samuel, Elijah, or Ezra; and how manifestly more so now, "But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name", <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:12">John  1:12</a>.<a name=303:5></a>

		Now when Christ's rejection was impending, He propounded the parable of the sower, setting forth the effect during His absence of the sowing of His word here on earth; <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13">Matthew  13</a>.<a name=303:6></a> Six similitudes are used.<a name=303:7></a> In the first there was only the true thing; it was spoiled by profession.<a name=303:8></a> The second - the mustard-tree, is man's interpretation of the purpose, something conspicuous to the eye of man - a huge ecclesiastical system to disguise the rejection of the Lord.<a name=303:9></a> In the third, the leaven, all that is good is corrupted.<a name=303:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the last three similitudes are given inside with the Lord; He "sent the multitude away, and went into the house" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13:36">Matthew  13:36</a>); and you cannot learn them unless you are inside with Him, apart from the influence of men.<a name=303:11></a> No passage in Scripture has been so misunderstood or misinterpreted as these three last similitudes.<a name=303:12></a> The first is what the word is to effect according to His mind and the purpose of God - to form a treasure here in the world for Him.<a name=303:13></a> It was not conspicuous to the eye of man like the imposing structures that we see now all over the kingdom, but it was hid as our life is hid with Christ in God.<a name=303:14></a> But He sells all that He has,

		The second simile is the pearl; that is what is apparent and beautiful for those who have an eye to see, like the gates of the new Jerusalem.<a name=304:2></a> Thirdly, the net, the import of which is altogether misunderstood.<a name=304:3></a> Many evangelists think that it is catching the fish, but the great object of the net is to bring them to shore to make selection, to select the good, those who are to form the treasure of Christ.<a name=304:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we learn from <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>that His own have to come out as Himself here in this world, characterised by unity, altogether apart, separate from the world, waiting for His glory, learning down here the love of the Father, loved by the Father as Christ is loved.<a name=304:5></a> When John was beheaded (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#14:10">Matthew  14:10</a>), the Lord's rejection being at hand, He went into "a desert place", apart from the haunts of men; the poor of the flock seek Him there, and He feeds them there as He does this day.<a name=304:6></a> Then He sends His disciples in the ship across the sea, to see how they can bear up in the storm, typically the power of evil in an earthly system, while He Himself takes a new position; He is not only superior to the power of evil, as He always was, but now He is supreme, He is above it, and when thus seen by His disciples, Peter desires to join Him.<a name=304:7></a> The only place where the saint can join Him now is on the other side of death.<a name=304:8></a> Peter learns his own weakness in coming to Him, but the hand of Christ draws him to Himself.<a name=304:9></a> This indicates how we are to join Christ now while we are in the world.<a name=304:10></a> This way is not visible to man; but coming to Him as the living Stone, we also, as living stones, are built up a spiritual house for Him; (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:4">1 Peter  2:4</a>,5).<a name=304:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We must begin, as in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>, with, "For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one".<a name=305:9></a> This is the most essential step, for until you enter into the reality of this you never advance; you cannot come to Him but as of Him.<a name=305:10></a> To this Abraham's steward was sworn.<a name=305:11></a> You must come in an entirely new order, and then you find, like Peter on the water, that though you meet trials on the road, He bears you up and carries you to His own side, and finally you have boldness to enter into the holiest, and are in company with Him in that bright scene in the presence of God.<a name=305:12></a> Now your heart being drawn away from the earth to Him personally in heaven, you are ready for the truth of Colossians.<a name=305:13></a> Dead and risen with Him, you know Him as Head in the sphere of His life, and you find, as in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>, the purpose of God can

	<div class="paragraph">
		In conclusion, the church left its first love, like Israel caring more for God's blessings than to be in accordance with His pleasure.<a name=306:6></a> Love always degenerates when more occupied with the gift than with the giver.<a name=306:7></a> If I were really devoted to the Lord, I could not enjoy any gifts of His without Himself being paramount.<a name=306:8></a> The church from association with unbelievers had become a great house with vessels to dishonour, so that the first absolute duty was to separate from vessels to dishonour, following righteousness, faith, love, peace with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.<a name=306:9></a> When all was failure around, the Lord was the resource of every true heart; therefore Paul's teaching was necessary for the servants in order to draw their hearts into the purpose of God, to be here on the earth as members of the body of Christ.<a name=306:10></a> Hence we find in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:8">Revelation  3:8</a> that those who cleave simply to the Lord will find how He will undertake for them, "I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name", so that in

		PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE

	<div class="paragraph">
		There are three lines of instruction connected with the past, present, and the future as they affect the believer, and to be occupied with one of these to the exclusion of the others must be a loss and privation; as we might say of three of our senses - seeing, hearing, and feeling, all of which should be in use.<a name=314:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The past is that which we learn first, and can never lose sight of.<a name=314:2></a> It refers to the expression of God's grace towards us, consequent now on the finished work of Christ.<a name=314:3></a> We find all through Scripture from the beginning, that the man who turned to God was the object of His love and care.<a name=314:4></a> We see this in the case of Abel, Enoch, Noah, and so on all along the line of faith until the fulness of grace came in the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ, when God's love shone out in all its magnitude on the returning sinner, and His righteousness in His past dealings of grace was fully declared.<a name=314:5></a> It is in this line that the believer is first deeply occupied, and it is most attractive and enjoyable; yet if we stop there, there is no progress in the soul.<a name=314:6></a> As long as we dwell exclusively on the fact of being an object with God, blessed as that is, we are more occupied with His loving kindness towards us in our own circumstances than with the love that is in His own heart; so that in a measure we judge of His love by His gifts, instead of seeing that no gift could be the measure of His love.<a name=314:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When His love is really before us, we are not thinking of what His love has done or will do for us, but He Himself is our object.<a name=314:8></a> We learn that "He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?<a name=314:9></a>" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:32">Romans  8:32</a>) And it is undeniable that while we are occupied with what love can do for us, Christ Himself, who is the full expression of God's love, is not before us as the object of our hearts; we have not come to

		Finally, the Spirit of God, according to <a href="../bible/John.htm#15:26">John  15:26</a>, sent from Himself in heaven, demonstrates (<a href="../bible/John.htm#16:8">John  16:8</a>) what the world is in its true moral character: "of sin, because they believe not on me; of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more; of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged".<a name=318:7></a> Secondly, He was to guide them into all truth and to show them things to come.<a name=318:8></a> Thirdly, "He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you".<a name=318:9></a> He was to bring out to them heavenly things.<a name=318:10></a> This is the highest point of your present, because you come from Him in heaven, as

		No one can be in communion with Him without knowing how the church has been leavened by professors, so that it has become a "great house", where there are vessels to honour and to dishonour; and when anyone gets near Him he will first purge himself from vessels to dishonour, and then follow righteousness, faith, love, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.<a name=319:2></a> If he walks in the Spirit he is in concert with the Lord's present mind, so that Paul's teaching, which refers to our union with Christ in heaven, is the great truth for the servant to present in the last days, and is the aim and end of his ministry to the saints.<a name=319:3></a> Thus he is led by the Lord to understand how the truth in John's gospel can alone awaken souls from the dead and formal state into which they have fallen, and revive the truth of union with Christ so that they are prepared for the future by being in present concert with the Lord.<a name=319:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The one who is in concert with the Lord would also know that His attitude towards the professing church is that He is walking in the midst of the seven candlesticks in judgment, and that in the last days those who cleave to Him, though they have but a little power, keep His word and do not deny His name.<a name=319:5></a> They are sustained and succoured by Him in a remarkable way, though apostasy will advance, and culminate in Babylon - which is man surrounded with all the luxuries of this world, but perfectly independent of God.<a name=319:6></a> Amidst all the confusion and darkness here the future is lighted up by the fact that you know Him as He is in the present, and that you are here for Him when He comes.<a name=319:7></a> So that at the close we find the Spirit and the bride inviting Him to come and take His rightful place on the earth; then the bride will be here for Him as the new Jerusalem.<a name=319:8></a>

		Now it is to be noted that while those are interesting, who speak of the Lord's walk and ways upon the earth as showing what He was in our circumstances, they do not get to the present until they know that they are in Christ, and that the Spirit is in them, so that they have full deliverance from themselves; and then, while it is still interesting to look at Him in connection with our circumstances, we have to do with a much greater thing, viz.<a name=320:1></a>, with Himself in His own circumstances.<a name=320:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One remark more, the snare of those who are satisfied with the knowledge of what Christ has done for them and of God's favour towards them, is to become occupied with the future in the line of prophecy, and they are thus diverted from the great controlling interest of being in company with the Lord, in His present mind and purpose.<a name=320:3></a>

		THE RELATION OF THE GOSPEL TO THE CHURCH
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is important for every christian to understand the relation between the gospel and the church.<a name=327:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul at his conversion was given the first intimation of the mystery of God, which had been kept secret from the foundation of the world.<a name=327:2></a> It is expressed in the words: "Why persecutest thou me?<a name=327:3></a>" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:4">Acts  9:4</a>) So that not only is a believer saved by the work of Christ, but every christian is a part of Christ.<a name=327:4></a> Hence the first thing known must be the gospel; if the gospel is not clearly known, the mystery of the gospel cannot be known.<a name=327:5></a> We do not hear much in the New Testament of evangelists, but the gospel is referred to over sixty times in the epistles, from which we gather the grave importance of the subject, and the responsibility of the preacher who presents it.<a name=327:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nowadays, when many earnest men give up their secular callings to preach the gospel, it is of deep importance that they should not only know the scope of the gospel, but that they should enter into the reality of what it is to be sent by Christ, the Head of the church.<a name=327:7></a> For "how shall they preach, except they be sent?<a name=327:8></a>" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#10:15">Romans  10:15</a>).<a name=327:9></a> From what one hears of evangelists generally, one is forced to conclude that they do not know more than forgiveness of sins, and, while their zeal and devotedness must be greatly commended, the desire and prayer of us all should be that they may be fitted for their work.<a name=327:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As far as I see, an evangelist ought not only to know his own acceptance with God, but he ought to so realise what it is to be "in Christ" that he can say, "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death".<a name=327:11></a> (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:2">Romans  8:2</a>) I daresay that as a rule all who have acceptance with God by faith would say that they were in Christ according to the word of God, but deliverance is only realised by
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=328>[Page 328]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the Spirit dwelling in you.<a name=328:1></a> The evangelist ought to know what his place is in the church as a member of the body of Christ, before he can be assured that he is gifted by the Lord, and sent forth to fulfil the service of an evangelist, to which he is commended by his spiritual elders, signified (when the church was in order) by the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.<a name=328:2></a> In christendom (no doubt from giving a natural meaning to the spiritual idea) every one is supposed to prepare for the ministry - to study for orders, as they say.<a name=328:3></a> It is evidently the mind of the Lord that His servant should learn of Him in the assembly, not only that he has received a gift and is assured of it, but that as qualified he is sent by the Lord - as we read in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:21">John  20:21</a>, "As my Father hath sent me, even so send I you".<a name=328:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is unaccountable that while most earnest men seek to be evangelists, so few devote themselves to the care of souls; an unseen but most profitable service.<a name=328:5></a> Certainly there is even a greater want of pastors and teachers than there is of evangelists.<a name=328:6></a> I believe if everyone was quietly and devotedly occupied with Christ's interests in the assembly, the Lord would before long make known to each what his gift was.<a name=328:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think we ought all to take it to heart that if the gospel is imperfectly presented there cannot be fruit according to the mind of Christ.<a name=328:8></a> If your beginning is imperfect you cannot reach to the finish.<a name=328:9></a> If you do not know God's gospel you cannot reach God's purpose.<a name=328:10></a> The apostle Paul can say, "I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ and him crucified" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:2">1 Corinthians  2:2</a>) - a living Person in glory, and that Person crucified here.<a name=328:11></a> He expected his converts to be according to his preaching.<a name=328:12></a> He could say afterwards, "I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase".<a name=328:13></a> (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3:6">1 Corinthians  3:6</a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As a rule, as far as I know, the evangelists faithfully present the value of the blood, but I question whether
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=329>[Page 329]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		many of them have the gospel that was preached by the apostle Paul to the Corinthians - the living Person in glory, crucified here.<a name=329:1></a> I learn from <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:23">1 Corinthians  1:23</a> that Christ crucified is "unto the Jews a stumbling block, and unto the Greeks foolishness".<a name=329:2></a> Many would be glad to listen to atonement by the blood of Christ who are not ready to hear that man has been set aside in the cross so that to a Jew who looked to the law the cross was "a stumblingblock", for how could he keep the law if the man was set aside?<a name=329:3></a> and to the gentile it was "foolishness", for if man is set aside, where is there a place for human wisdom?<a name=329:4></a> Thus the apostle adds, "I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.<a name=329:5></a> And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:3">1 Corinthians  2:3</a>, 4.<a name=329:6></a> Whereas in our days, very often the more eloquent and stirring the preaching, the more it acts on human feelings, the more it is approved, and the greater number of those who profess to be converted, because by faith in the blood they are assured of eternal safety, can go on in natural things here, with the law as a rule of life.<a name=329:7></a> The burden of the evangelist's message is, that God has Himself removed the distance between Him and man, and that He receives the believer in all the nearness and acceptance of the Lord Jesus Christ, so that Paul could say to the Philippian jailer in his distress "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved", (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16:31">Acts  16:31</a>) and we find him that very night rejoicing in God with all his house.<a name=329:8></a> Such a convert would be able to say, "I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ".<a name=329:9></a> (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3:8">Philippians  3:8</a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		No one can read the early chapters of 1 Thessalonians and <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1">1 Corinthians  1</a>and 2 without being struck with the grave and solemn responsibility of the evangelist, both as to himself and as to the tidings he announced, and the results were characterised by the

		<a name=330>[Page 330]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		tidings.<a name=330:1></a> But when we look at things in the present day, there is little of that solemn sense of divine responsibility as sent by the Lord to present the gospel in a given place.<a name=330:2></a> Earnest men are satisfied if they can by any means, or anywhere, collect a crowd, and deliver to them an impassioned appeal as to faith in the blood of Christ, and often seem to forget that God converts the soul: it is their duty to deliver the message of His grace.<a name=330:3></a> Consequently while there are many conversions, how seldom do we hear of one who breaks from the world, and honestly avows, "God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world".<a name=330:4></a> (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#6:14">Galatians  6:14</a>) As far as I see, converts are characteristically like those who preach to them.<a name=330:5></a> Apollos was blessed in his work though he preached an imperfect gospel; and when we hear of him again he is fully on the Lord's side, but not as an evangelist; he refreshed the saints, he 'watered' them.<a name=330:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I may add in corroboration of what I have advanced, that no servant can be on the earth for the Lord, as in <a href="../bible/John.htm#15">John  15</a>, who has not come from the Lord inside, as in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>.<a name=330:7></a> <a href="#330:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>

		these come out in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1">1 Corinthians  1</a>, where the gospel is refused.<a name=331:1></a> Christ crucified is to the Jew a stumbling-block, and to the nations foolishness.<a name=331:2></a> These are the two great hindrances to the reception of the gospel; the Corinthians suffered from the one, the Galatians from the other; but with the Colossians the two combined to hinder the servant of Christ; we find these two snares full blown in christendom under the names of rationalism and ritualism.<a name=331:3></a> But no servant is free from this combined evil in some shape or form who has not entered into death with Christ, "from the rudiments of the world".<a name=331:4></a> If you be risen with Him, you are in the power of His life, you are under His direction as Head; then you truly abide in Him and you are His disciple.<a name=331:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am afraid the tendency is to enter on the service of Christ very little apprehending the solemnity and blessedness of the calling.<a name=331:6></a> If you are not His disciple you cannot be His friend.<a name=331:7></a> It is only as you realise your union with Him in heaven that you are in His confidence.<a name=331:8></a> You then can come out here in heavenly power to glorify Him according to His pleasure, because you realise the power which wrought in Christ; that power is to usward who believe, according to the counsel of God.<a name=331:9></a> You know that you are raised up and made to sit together in the heavenlies in Christ, and then you begin to learn the prayer in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:16">Ephesians  3:16</a>,17, "That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man; that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith".<a name=331:10></a> Many confound this with their own state, instead of seeing that it is His interests that now control your affections, so that you come out here from Him, according to <a href="../bible/John.htm#16">John  16</a>, to find the prince of this world is judged, and that you are made superior to all the power of evil; and it is then truly that you enter into the great fact that your gift is from the glorified Man.<a name=331:11></a> When Christ had overcome

		everything here, when He had "ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men".<a name=332:1></a> (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:8">Ephesians  4:8</a>) It is plain that although the servant may be blessed in the exercise of his gift, he is not in full power with regard to it until he enjoys union with Christ in heaven; and this is not only that we look for the portion of the church as the bride of Christ hereafter, but being so in His confidence now, and so enjoying His place and His power, that as Rebecca was a comfort to Isaac when his mother died, so now when His earthly people are set aside, we are to be to the satisfaction of Christ's heart in the darkest day here.<a name=332:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Finally I would add that while our progress depends on the measure of the gospel we begin with, the aim and perfection of all ministry is to lead souls into present enjoyment and the purpose of God; this is the finish of His grace.<a name=332:3></a> We see from <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4">Ephesians  4</a>that the Spirit of God looks at the saints in their true calling, their normal place for Christ here, that is, in union with Him.<a name=332:4></a> But alas!<a name=332:5></a> we know that few of those servants who are most before the public really know it for themselves, and if they have not reached it for themselves, how can they minister the truth which would lead others to it?<a name=332:6></a> While on the other hand no one can know the gospel of the glory of Christ, and his nearness to Him in glory as Paul preached it, without entering into the reality of union with Him.<a name=332:7></a> Then it would be the natural outflow of his heart to preach it; such an one could truly say, "I believed, and therefore have I spoken".<a name=332:8></a> (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#116:10">Psalm  116:10</a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus two things ought to be before the evangelist: firstly, the greatness of the subject of the gospel itself; and secondly, that it is by the gospel souls are prepared for the purpose of God; for as a rule everyone is detained or hindered by the imperfect gospel he has received, so that instead of realised union with Christ being the normal state of souls, it is a very rare exception when it is known.<a name=332:9></a>

		"The promise of the Spirit through faith" is the blessing now given in Jesus Christ to us gentiles in answer to the faith of Abraham, as we gather from <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3:14">Galatians  3:14</a>.<a name=333:3></a> First we learn the greatness of this blessing, given to crown and to perpetuate all that had been wrought by our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=333:4></a> "The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified", <a href="../bible/John.htm#7:39">John  7:39</a>.<a name=333:5></a> When God had been fully glorified here by a Man - the Man Christ Jesus - that Man was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father: "Having therefore been exalted by the right hand of God, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this which ye behold and hear", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:33">Acts  2:33</a>.<a name=333:6></a> There is a day coming when, as we read (<a href="../bible/Joel.htm#2:28">Joel  2:28</a>): "I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh".<a name=333:7></a> That day has not come yet, but the promise of the Father has come, according to Christ's request in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>, that the Father would give to His own another Comforter, who should remain here and dwell in them.<a name=333:8></a> It is important to bear in mind the difference between the word 'on' which will be fulfilled in the future day, and the word 'in' which belongs to the church period.<a name=333:9></a> 'On' signifies more an influence like wind upon a sail.<a name=333:10></a> Many do not see the Spirit to be more than an influence, whereas the word

		even after having had the sense of liberty and the power of the Spirit, if you give way to some influence of the flesh, and thus grieve the Spirit of God, you are not only powerless, but you are like a bird with a wounded wing, you are depressed with a sense of loss, and in sowing to the flesh you have only reaped corruption; whereas if you walk in the Spirit, you daily enjoy more and more the wonderful nature of your new position, as set free from the religion and the desires of the flesh.<a name=335:1></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is important to bear in mind that a snare often commences with something that seems simple and harmless - a snare may not be anything morally wrong, but is generally that which you naturally like best; when it becomes a ruling desire so that discontent ensues if you do not possess it, as with Eve, the carnal mischief has begun, you begin to "thirst"; and though you do not lose the assurance of God's grace in your soul, you are really asleep, that is inactive, and you will not be happy or in power until you have judged the desire which led you captive, and have turned to the Lord with a deeper sense of His love; for when Christ is in His right place the snare is broken and you are delivered; you are filled with thankfulness at the completeness of your deliverance, and the ease with which it is effected.<a name=335:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You are delivered from the snares of the mind in quite another way; we learn that the Corinthians were ensnared by human wisdom; the apostle addressed them as carnal, as babes in Christ; and having exposed their failure in the first epistle, he presses upon them in the second how he had presented Christ to them.<a name=335:3></a> From the law there was a ministration of condemnation, while from Christ there was a ministration of righteousness from the glory: "We all, looking on the glory of the Lord, with unveiled face, are transformed according to the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Lord the Spirit".<a name=335:4></a> (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#3:18">2 Corinthians  3:18</a>)

		The Galatians had to learn the power of the Spirit for deliverance, and to them the apostle shows that the flesh with all its pretension is to be supplanted by Christ Himself, the true Isaac.<a name=336:1></a> The Corinthians had to learn in the gospel of the glory of Christ their acceptance with God.<a name=336:2></a> When this is learned His wisdom and the rule of it become the joy of your heart; like the queen of Sheba, you are beside yourself under the sense of His wisdom; you not only see it in Him, but you are made through grace to share in it, so that you come from His presence controlled by His wisdom; your own mind is silenced, and you learn that you have the mind of Christ.<a name=336:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It must be borne in mind that the Spirit of God is occupied with each of us individually before He conducts us to the portion that is common to us as belonging to the bride of Christ.<a name=336:4></a> After a soul is settled as to his acceptance and deliverance, the next step is to know Christ in communion with His own in the assembly.<a name=336:5></a> Each individual has to be conducted like Peter to the Lord's side, and thus having come to the living Stone is a component part of His assembly, where His present mind and interest on the earth are to be known.<a name=336:6></a> I see many take this their true position without being in the reality of it, and this accounts for the want of concert there is in those who take part in the meetings, for we cannot truly be competent to enter into Christ's mind if we are not at rest as to our own state.<a name=336:7></a> If there had been no apostle to correct the Corinthians and Galatians, into what a fearful state of confusion they would have fallen; that is very much what we find generally in christendom now, and what we are all prone to, unless there be real guides, like Timothy, who know the path to lead in.<a name=336:8></a>

		No one is truly built in who has not come to the living Stone, and known the Lord at the other side of death; I believe that one might enjoy this grace for a time in the assembly, and yet not have entered experimentally into the momentous fact of having crossed the Jordan, and of being in the sphere of Christ's life.<a name=337:5></a> There the Spirit of God is in His own sphere, and He conducts you to Christ as Eliezer conducted Rebecca to Isaac, and you enter into the knowledge of union with Christ, and thus is fulfilled to you what we read of in <a href="../bible/John.htm#16:14">John  16:14</a> "He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you".<a name=337:6></a> Thus we become acquainted with things that "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.<a name=337:7></a> But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit".<a name=337:8></a> (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:10">1 Corinthians  2:10</a>) You are then, so to speak, within the region where the Spirit is at home, and where you can drink of the fountain of

		In conclusion, I may add a word as to the leading of the Spirit in the assembly.<a name=338:2></a> Every christian who is at peace with God desires to break bread in remembrance of Christ in His death, though few know at first the solemnity of having communion with His death, but as each one is drawn to Him, and feeds on His death, by the Spirit, he is awakened to desire the Lord's presence, and to know what the disciples knew when that word was fulfilled to them: "I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#16:22">John  16:22</a>) - "Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord".<a name=338:3></a> (<a href="../bible/John.htm#20:20">John  20:20</a>) This can only be known by the Spirit, for Christ is only to be known at the other side of death, and when you know Him thus you have come to the living Stone.<a name=338:4></a> A new day is opened to you when you find yourself in His presence, and enter into the reality of what is typified in <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#8">Leviticus  8</a>.<a name=338:5></a> Having remembered Him in death, you are of the consecrated company feeding on the blessedness of His acceptance in the presence of God where He is known as the One greater than Moses; where not only you find your own rest, but where He, according to <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>, fits you for Himself in divine seclusion, so that you can come forth abiding in Him to bear fruit; and so answering to His mind, you learn that you are His friends; the Holy Spirit from Himself in heaven makes you superior to all the power of evil here, and at the same time makes known to you what eye hath not seen.<a name=338:6></a> You come to the range of His own delights.<a name=338:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		One word more in the way of caution.<a name=338:8></a> Though the Spirit does not leave us, yet when we grieve Him by sowing to the flesh, indulging in our own thoughts or tastes, He does not help us to the next step until the evil is judged.<a name=338:9></a> It is then failure occurs, because the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A servant of the Lord does not know the true character of his service, until he is so near the Lord that his heart has been deeply affected with the fact that the Lord is not here, that He is rejected by man, and that He is sitting down at the right hand of God.<a name=339:12></a> Thus while the servant has to do with the Lord outside of
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		everything here, his service is addressed to those of His own who are here.<a name=340:1></a> So he begins with learning the Lord where He is in glory, and then conveying His mind with all diligence to His people down here.<a name=340:2></a> This is the servant's preparation for his work.<a name=340:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next, the more he surveys and knows the state of the church, the more he is awakened to a sense of its grievous departure from the Lord, though his heart rejoices in finding here and there those who really are attached to Christ; the more also he is filled with zeal of heart to be a true help to His weak ones scattered amid the confusion.<a name=340:4></a> Like Nehemiah, he not merely sees the deplorable ruin, but he sets himself to strengthen the things that remain - to feed the sheep and lambs.<a name=340:5></a> In order to be equipped for his work, the servant's resources must be all in Christ; he must be like Elisha when Elijah was taken away; he must act as if everything depended on himself.<a name=340:6></a> The first thing is to be "strong in the Lord" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#6:10">Ephesians  6:10</a>) and "strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:1">2 Timothy  2:1</a>); not looking for any one to support him, but so helped by the Lord that his one thought is to care for the sheep and lambs of the flock.<a name=340:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Though the gentile power has cut off even the apostle, the servant for difficult times feels responsible to maintain what the apostle communicated, and as he maintains it, he is of real help and use.<a name=340:8></a> Among men, if a great general is cut off in battle every loyal soldier would be zealous in making up for the loss; but with the soldier of Christ, the Timothy, it is not only that he feels charged with the communications of the apostle, but he has this amazing comfort, that the Lord will give him "understanding in all things", <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:7">2 Timothy  2:7</a>.<a name=340:9></a> Many are careful students of the word who are not effective in their ministry, because they trust more to their knowledge of the word than to the present help of the Lord, giving them "understanding in all things".<a name=340:10></a> It is a fact that those who are great
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=341>[Page 341]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		students of the word often depend so much on their knowledge of it, that they have not the mind of the Lord for the time.<a name=341:1></a> Though the study of the word and the knowledge of it are most necessary, yet it is not the knowledge of the word that makes the servant a true help to the sheep, but the Lord Himself giving him the "understanding".<a name=341:2></a> Many are satisfied with the knowledge of the word, and unintentionally make it a substitute for the direction which can only come from the Head.<a name=341:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The guide then is not only strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus, but he is independent of all human resources; and in maintaining God's word and counsel for His own to the end, he receives direct light from the Lord Himself as to what suits them for the time.<a name=341:4></a> The servant is called to war; he is in conflict with all the things around; therefore he must not be entangled with the affairs of this life, "that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier", (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:4">2 Timothy  2:4</a>) but he has to go through severe drill before he is a soldier.<a name=341:5></a> His first conflict is with the world; I do not refer here to the conflict in his own soul before be has learned deliverance, because he cannot enter on the duty of a soldier at all until he is established in grace; hence his first public conflict is with the world as such, and his usefulness much depends on the completeness of his victory.<a name=341:6></a> Like Moses, he esteems "the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:26">Hebrews  11:26</a>); his heart is so deeply affected by the fact of Christ's rejection here that possessions or prospects have lost their hold upon him; he may not be called on to surrender his possessions, but he does not use them to maintain a position here.<a name=341:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		To investigate each would be profitless; the simple duty of the servant is to stand clear of them all, and to wait on the Lord for guidance as to the path.<a name=342:1></a> It is quite possible to quote Scripture in support of a human opinion which claims to be derived from Scripture; and this, backed up by the sayings and writings of pious men, has very general acceptance, whereas a spiritual judgment can only be apprehended by the spiritual, because while the human mind can take in a human opinion, the spiritual mind alone can understand the things of the Spirit of God, or form a spiritual judgment.<a name=342:2></a> "Which also we speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, communicating spiritual [things] by spiritual [means]", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:13">1 Corinthians  2:13</a>.<a name=342:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		No soul with any sense of nearness to God could survey the fellowship of religious meetings around us, without being pained by the little sense there is of the holiness which belongs to the house of God - how, as we see in the Old Testament, that even touching a dead body defiled the tabernacle of God.<a name=342:4></a> In the sects, though people are not received into fellowship unless agreed on certain points, yet there is little or no discipline to keep the house of God even up to the light of a pious Jew; hence, the first result of enlightenment in a soul true to the Lord, is to purge himself from the vessels to dishonour, and to "pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart".<a name=342:5></a> (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:22">2 Timothy  2:22</a>) The Scripture intimates that such are to be found.<a name=342:6></a> It is not to set up some new thing, but to follow righteousness, etc.<a name=342:7></a>, with them who have already separated from the unholy mixture in the church.<a name=342:8></a>

		Next, the servant or guide must be unfettered in his own house.<a name=342:9></a> If his wife is heart and soul with him, she is no hindrance but a help and solace to him.<a name=342:10></a> When she is not quite up to him, but is silent and prayerful, watching diligently that nothing in the house

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to his children, the servant's simple duty is to bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.<a name=343:8></a> There is no entanglement while they are young; the danger is when they are grown up and start for themselves: then he is sure to be entangled, if he is either patron or partner in their interests.<a name=343:9></a> When he is so, he returns in heart to the world he had renounced, and his separation to God is more or less compromised.<a name=343:10></a> It has been said, You can refuse the world for yourself, but not for your children.<a name=343:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that you are fitted to fulfil the responsibility of a guide, your beginning is of the greatest importance, hence the apostle writes: "Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel", <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:8">2 Timothy  2:8</a>.<a name=344:6></a> The risen Christ in glory is the only source of blessing to the Jew as well as to the gentile; hence it is most necessary that a servant who would lead on souls should see that they have begun according to God, that they are not only assured of their forgiveness and acceptance with God, but are so delivered from the old man that as "in Christ" the "best robe", they can joy in God.<a name=344:7></a> No soul is established in grace until he knows that he is received by God in Christ risen from the dead, and that in himself he is in practical deliverance, by the Spirit made free from the law of sin and death; <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:2">Romans  8:2</a>.<a name=344:8></a>
	</div>

		THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SCRIPTURES ACCORDING TO THE MIND OF GOD
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The blessed God in His goodness and love has given to us the holy Scriptures, that we may know His mind in relation to His people.<a name=345:5></a> Now, while acknowledging this great favour the question which should deeply occupy our hearts is - Do we truly understand His mind?<a name=345:6></a> It is evident, even with regard to human things, that you may have much knowledge without the ability to use it; and this is also the case in divine things.<a name=345:7></a> The greatest departure from the truth has been the result of a mere human knowledge of the Scriptures.<a name=345:8></a> Thus Rome, in carnal wisdom and fearing any interpretation of the Bible not authorised by the so-called church, has interdicted the reading of it.<a name=345:9></a>

		Now the Scriptures are, as we may say, in two volumes: the Old Testament which reaches from Adam to Christ; the New Testament which is from Christ's birth to His coming in glory.<a name=346:1></a> As far as I see, the Old Testament is for the individual saint, while in the New you are connected with the assembly.<a name=346:2></a> As to the Old Testament Scriptures, Timothy is told that they are able to make him "wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus", <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#3:15">2 Timothy  3:15</a>.<a name=346:3></a> Now though he read and re-read them and might have a correct knowledge of what is recorded in them, yet if he had not faith in Christ Jesus, he is not made wise by them.<a name=346:4></a> We see in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11">Hebrews  11</a>, from Abel until the walls of Jericho fell down, the history of a soul walking in faith; and every believer now can ascertain the stage he has arrived at in that history.<a name=346:5></a> Enoch, the seventh from Adam, is specially characterised by faith, so that it is not merely knowledge of the Lord's words that is sufficient, but having faith in Himself.<a name=346:6></a> Cain had the knowledge of His word, but he had not faith.<a name=346:7></a> Lot had the knowledge of His word, but he had not faith.<a name=346:8></a> The spies had the knowledge of His word, but only two of them had faith.<a name=346:9></a> Saul had the knowledge of His word, but he had not faith.<a name=346:10></a> Israel had the knowledge of His word, rehearsed over and over by the prophets, and yet they had not faith; so that eventually they made the word of God of none effect through their tradition, and used the law of God to crucify the Lord of glory.<a name=346:11></a>

		A WORD TO ALL CHRISTIANS<br>DEAR FELLOW-CHRISTIAN,<br>Let me ask you in true brotherly love, Do you understand that by the grace of God, there is in the gospel the setting aside of one man, Adam and all his race, and the bringing in of another Man, Jesus Christ the Son of God, risen from the dead?<a name=357:1></a>

		The light of God's grace is often obstructed in souls, from reluctance to accept this truth of the change of man before God, and to see that the work of Christ was not to improve the first man, but to set him aside in judgment, to bring in a Man of a new order - that is Himself, "The second man, out of heaven" (see <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:47">1 Corinthians  15:47</a>).<a name=357:7></a> The believer is of Him; "Both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:11">Hebrews  2:11</a>.<a name=357:8></a> They are members of His body, of His flesh, and of His bones; <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:30">Ephesians  5:30</a>.<a name=357:9></a> We are thus wholly His - our bodies are the Lord's,

		THE EFFECT OF TRUTH KNOWN IN POWER
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Divine power necessarily transforms man to a new condition.<a name=358:5></a> If this be ceded, and it cannot be denied, we can understand the force of the apostle's words, "I .<a name=358:6></a>.<a name=358:7></a> .<a name=358:8></a> will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power".<a name=358:9></a> (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#4:19">1 Corinthians  4:19</a>) Any condition or manner of life is easily adopted, when there is not only power for it, but when it is according to the ruling desire.<a name=358:10></a> A young bird enjoys flying, though it is new to him, and carries him to new scenes; because besides having the power to fly it is according to his taste to fly.<a name=358:11></a> Now an imitation is an imposition at once irksome and rigid, and always gives the impression that it is not according to your taste, because you discontinue it when you are in private or off your guard.<a name=358:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When a man is converted it is very evident that a new power has begun to rule him; he separates from his old associates, and seeks solitude in order to find God.<a name=358:13></a> This is the first step in the history of faith; the

		light of the gospel shines into his soul, and he knows that the God he seeks can be just and the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus.<a name=359:1></a> Like Abel, he knows that Christ bore the judgment due to him.<a name=359:2></a> One not chargeable with the offence has borne the judgment of the offence; thus he obtains witness that he is righteous, and shall not come into judgment; and as far as I see in the history of faith, we must connect Enoch with Abel; for though everyone does not enjoy walking with God, it is there the work of Christ places you.<a name=359:3></a> You learn that you have passed out of death into life.<a name=359:4></a> No one can have truly entered on this first step without taking a very distinct path here, a path very different in life and manner, especially marked by the company such an one keeps (see <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#1">Psalm  1</a>) and by the way in which he breaks away from his old associations; so that his walk is in keeping with his ruling desire.<a name=359:5></a> "His delight is in the law of the Lord".<a name=359:6></a> (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#1:2">Psalm  1:2</a>)

		The second step in faith, as I may say, is how a man accepted of God is set up on the earth.<a name=359:7></a> This is typified by Noah in the ark.<a name=359:8></a> God says, "The end of all flesh is come before me" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#6:13">Genesis  6:13</a>) - not only this, but all the earth "having its subsistence out of water and in water .<a name=359:9></a>.<a name=359:10></a>.<a name=359:11></a> deluged with water, perished", <a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#3:5">2 Peter  3:5</a>,6.<a name=359:12></a> Noah and his house are saved in the ark, saved from the judgment; and after being there more than a whole year, Noah is placed on the earth, and in offering a burnt-offering he finds that he is not only out of judgment, but that he is in the favour of God; so that through God's goodness he is here on the earth in favour, where once he was under judgment and the curse of God; he is now assured (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#8:22">Genesis  8:22</a>) of the continuance of seed-time and harvest, summer and winter, etc.<a name=359:13></a>, and further, he is given power to subdue everything here for his own benefit.<a name=359:14></a> But he cannot control himself, and is carried away by excess; and the descendants of the man so highly favoured, set on earth in such new and gracious terms, eventually

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we see that the true place for everyone brought to God is to be here morally in the death of Christ, as set forth in the ark, which prefigured baptism.<a name=360:2></a> Many pious people think that because they have accepted the form of baptism, they are in the condition of it, but the condition can only be by the Spirit.<a name=360:3></a> It is by the Spirit of God alone that we can be dead indeed unto sin and alive unto God in Christ Jesus.<a name=360:4></a> We all know how prone we are to seek and to rest in possessions here.<a name=360:5></a> Though we do not join the world in their Babel-combination, yet we like the feeling of independence, and often avail ourselves of the opportunities or resources which God's providence affords, to become so, instead of using them in dependence on Him.<a name=360:6></a> In the secret of man's heart he likes independence of God.<a name=360:7></a>

		The manner of life of every christian should be characterised by being out of death through Christ's death, and in His life in Christ risen.<a name=360:8></a> Then by the power of the Spirit of God, he can use God's gracious provision for man on the earth without being carried away by excess.<a name=360:9></a> He learns how much better it is to be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess, but to be filled with the Spirit.<a name=360:10></a> While the world is seeking in one form or another to be independent of God, the christian's happy course is simple and continued dependence on Him.<a name=360:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The history of Abraham gives us an example of the blessing of faith, and the trials and temptations connected with it.<a name=361:7></a> He had a happy assurance of being in the right way, at the altar (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#12">Genesis  12</a>) when the Lord appeared unto him.<a name=361:8></a> Thus if we are walking in faith we are sure to get confirmation of our faith.<a name=361:9></a> Lot went with him; he represents those who imitate faith.<a name=361:10></a> Soon the test comes - a famine in the land - and Abraham gives up faith for Egypt: he drops from faith to man's resources, and there he is exposed to the danger of losing her who is nearest to him, and only escapes through God's gracious intervention.<a name=361:11></a> And now he returns to the path of faith, and then finds it absolutely necessary to separate from one who imitates faith.<a name=361:12></a> Lot soon betrays that he has not faith, for he seeks what suits him as a man - the green fields of Sodom.<a name=361:13></a>

		he puts his life in his hand, goes out by night and rescues Lot and his property; he receives no reward from the world, but has manifold more in this present time; for Melchisedec, King of Salem, meets him with bread and wine, and "he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth: and blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand".<a name=362:1></a> So that Abraham can say to the king of Sodom, "I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet .<a name=362:2></a>.<a name=362:3></a>.<a name=362:4></a> lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#14:18">Genesis  14:18</a> - 23.<a name=362:5></a>

		Now, in the offerings of the Old Testament, we find that there was no sin-offering until the law came.<a name=368:12></a> Abel's offering was acceptable to God; God testified of his gifts; it is more the burnt-offering; he obtained witness that he was righteous; death was necessarily connected with it, "without shedding of blood is no remission".<a name=368:13></a> (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9:22">Hebrews  9:22</a>)

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is important to see that souls learn the grace of God under the shelter of the blood, which His righteousness required as with Israel at the passover, and yet there was not the knowledge of sin put away.<a name=368:14></a> Now when we come to the offerings in Leviticus, we find that all those offerings which bring the offerer into present acceptance with God, are spoken of before the sin-offering is presented; and when the sin-offering is mentioned it is to be burned with fire; <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#6:30">Leviticus  6:30</a>.<a name=368:15></a>

		Now in the case of leprosy, which is a figure of innate sin, or sin in the flesh, the leper must be separated from his fellows (<a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#8">Leviticus  8</a>); it was contaminating; and when he was healed (<a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#14">Leviticus  14</a>) he was not only atoned for, but the bird, let loose in the open field, was the testimony that he was cleansed; he had to wash his flesh in water (<a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#14:8">Leviticus  14:8</a>,9) which implies that the leper was absolutely removed; he was no longer the leper, for the type sets forth figuratively the old man removed from the eye of God, not merely atoned for or improved, but the washing implies the entire removal of the leprous man.<a name=369:5></a> This is seen in pattern in the gospel (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#17">Luke  17</a>), where one of the ten lepers who were healed by the Lord's word returns to give glory to God, and fell down at His feet giving him thanks; he has left himself for the Lord.<a name=369:6></a> This greatly helps us to understand the removal of sin.<a name=369:7></a>

		Every diligent student of the passages I have brought forward will see that the work of Christ is not only for the forgiveness of sins, but that He Himself bore the judgment of God for the sinner.<a name=370:9></a> He did not die, as has been said, the death of a hero; the three hours on the cross was the terrible moment when He bore the judgment of sin, and which our Lord designates as "your hour, and the power of darkness", (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22:53">Luke  22:53</a>) and the anticipation of this made His sweat, as it were, great drops of blood.<a name=370:10></a> When He had borne the judgment He gave up His life.<a name=370:11></a> In everything, even unto death, He was the perfect offering for sweet savour to God; but in death He bore the judgment on man, and took the distant place.<a name=370:12></a> There He bruised the serpent's head, destroyed "him that had the power of death, that is, the devil", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:14">Hebrews  2:14</a>.<a name=370:13></a> "In that he died, he died unto sin once" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:10">Romans  6:10</a>); there He knew what it was to be forsaken of God, but He maintained what was due to God, and God's righteousness was established by Him in bearing the judgment due to man, and there He glorified God.<a name=370:14></a> Thus the righteousness of God was declared (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3:26">Romans  3:26</a>), so that God can

		If we look around us in christendom we see that man's imitation of divine work is that every candidate for the ministry must be prepared, and ordained for that sacred service.<a name=378:3></a> I refer to this only to show that religious man has a sense of the gravity of being a servant of God.<a name=378:4></a> Now, where there is more reality, and even true zeal, there is often a great lack of gravity in entering on the Lord's service.<a name=378:5></a> A young man of piety and zeal tries how he can preach, and if he can arrest souls, satisfies himself that he is called of God; but he may have no real idea of being "sent", or of the message.<a name=378:6></a> "How shall they preach, except they be sent?<a name=378:7></a>" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#10:15">Romans  10:15</a>).<a name=378:8></a>

		There are, as far as I see, three classes of preachers, the first class like Ahimaaz (<a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#18:22">2 Samuel  18:22</a>) is neither sure of being sent, nor of the message.<a name=378:9></a> In general the gospel of this class does not go beyond the superiority of Christ as a sacrifice to the Paschal lamb, or to any of the offerings under the law.<a name=378:10></a> Therefore the chief point of their preaching is pressing on the sinner the necessity of having Christ as a sacrifice for his sins before God; there is seldom any light as to how God has wrought from Himself.<a name=378:11></a> There is an idea of the atonement in the blood of Christ, but no idea of reconciliation.<a name=378:12></a> Reconciliation is not taught in the Old Testament and the word 'atonement' does not occur in the New Testament.<a name=378:13></a> Though souls get assurance of salvation from this preaching they do not get acceptance; it cannot lead them beyond trusting

		in the blood; they try to live conscientiously, but they have not full peace; if they have seasons of joy, they have also seasons of depression, and this often goes on to the end of their lives without their making any advance.<a name=379:1></a> With the preachers themselves there is seldom advance, for the measure they mete is measured to themselves; and instead of their path being as "the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day", (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#4:18">Proverbs  4:18</a>) they seem to grow darker, and with really less enjoyment at the end.<a name=379:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With the second class of preachers, the main point is pressing on their hearers the forgiveness of sins through the blood of Christ.<a name=379:3></a> These know justification - they preach Christ risen as the receipt for the debt paid - that He was "delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#4:25">Romans  4:25</a>.<a name=379:4></a> Many of their converts being justified by faith and having received the Spirit, have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=379:5></a> They rightly press the work of God's grace, that it is all His own work.<a name=379:6></a> This is objective truth, and most important in its place.<a name=379:7></a> It is what we must begin with, but many do not get beyond it, and if they do not, they do not enjoy the deliverance which the Spirit of God would effect in their souls, if they truly sought it.<a name=379:8></a> But instead of seeking true deliverance they assume to have it by the reckoning of faith, and that because God sees them clear from the old man in the cross, that they are clear from him themselves.<a name=379:9></a> Thus by this delusion they lose practically the work of the Spirit in them, and unless awakened from it, they do not advance beyond the fact that God clears them by His own mighty grace, which is, of course, the beginning of all blessing.<a name=379:10></a> They read the word and find that all is theirs because they belong to Christ, hut they are not in the power and enjoyment of it; they see all the purposes of God's sovereign grace, and speak of them in that way; but as far as I know they are not in the enjoyment of

	<div class="paragraph">
		The third class begin from God: Christ, as we see in all the gospels, is the prominent object.<a name=380:6></a> In Luke we find, "I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.<a name=380:7></a> For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord".<a name=380:8></a> (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:10">Luke  2:10</a>,11) In John's gospel, John the baptist proclaims, "Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world .<a name=380:9></a>.<a name=380:10></a> .<a name=380:11></a> he it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit".<a name=380:12></a> (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:29">John  1:29</a>, 33) He not only removes all that is contrary to God, but He brings in everything according to God.<a name=380:13></a>

		We see beautifully exemplified in the thief on the cross (though there was no preacher), that he has to do not only with the work, but with the One who did the work, and he is to be in company with Him in paradise.<a name=380:14></a> The apostle Paul could say to the Corinthians, "I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified".<a name=380:15></a> (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:2">1 Corinthians  2:2</a>) We find afterwards when he explained himself that this was the gospel of the glory of Christ which was especially committed to him.<a name=380:16></a> The nearer you are to Him in glory the more you are assured of the righteousness that is ministered

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The great difference between this last class, and the other two, is that not only is the work prominent, but Christ Himself is prominent.<a name=381:12></a> It is very plain that if Christ personally is before you, there must be an endless range for your heart, for you never can come to the end of Him.<a name=381:13></a> One portion of His grace could not satisfy; Himself alone can satisfy the heart.<a name=381:14></a> If you dwell on a passage of scripture only, you get only a partial apprehension of the truth, for Christ Himself is the truth; and according as Christ Himself is apprehended by the soul, so you impart to others; then it is true that "with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you".<a name=381:15></a> (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#7:2">Matthew  7:2</a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In our own day when God vouchsafed to give a restoration of the knowledge of His full purpose in grace, it was seen that the first part, the certainty of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		our salvation, was to be appropriated by faith, which is blessedly true; it was apprehended that God in His grace transferred a believer from Adam to Christ.<a name=382:1></a> But subsequently it was taught, and insisted on, that not only the first part, but all the purpose of His grace for us, could be appropriated and realised by faith, which is an imperfect apprehension of the truth, The truth is that our salvation must be appropriated by faith, but as the believer is on new ground in Christ, it is only by the Holy Spirit that we can appropriate and enjoy the range of God's purpose and grow up into the Head; the Spirit only can lead us into it.<a name=382:2></a> Thus, by the craft of the enemy, the great goodness of God to us in this latter day has been in a great measure lost sight of, and some are asserting that they know all the purpose of God in grace without having the great blessing which would result from being practically in each step.<a name=382:3></a> Surely this is enough to make the Lord's warning very emphatic to us in this day, "Take heed .<a name=382:4></a>.<a name=382:5></a>.<a name=382:6></a> how ye hear".<a name=382:7></a> <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#8:18">Luke  8:18</a>.<a name=382:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In conclusion I press the great contrast between the two latter classes.<a name=382:9></a> They both begin aright.<a name=382:10></a> They believe that the whole range of God's purpose is to be first apprehended by faith, and that the first step, our salvation, is appropriated by faith; that salvation is that God in His grace transfers the believer from Adam to Christ; but the former class do not see that all the rest of the purpose of God is only known as you are in Christ by the Spirit of God.<a name=382:11></a> Their mistake is that they think that because salvation is appropriated by faith, all the other parts of His grace can be likewise appropriated.<a name=382:12></a> For example, they assert that you get deliverance by the reckoning of faith, and do not see that you start on new ground, and therefore that your deliverance can only be in the life of Christ, and if you do not take the first step you cannot enjoy any of the rest.<a name=382:13></a> Hence while those who say that all can be appropriated by faith are zealous as to doctrine, they
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=383>[Page 383]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		really are not in the power and blessing of what is true for them.<a name=383:1></a> They believe in separation to God for all the children of God, and they gather together in the name of Christ, looking for His presence, refusing human ministry, and are correct in detail according to the letter of the word, but they have not got it vitally, they have not really learned <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#14">Matthew  14</a>; they have not crossed over to where Christ is, and they have not come to Him as the living Stone.<a name=383:2></a> They could not, because they are not practically in the life of Christ.<a name=383:3></a> They can speak clearly and interestingly of the Lord's presence in the assembly; of His being Head of the church and of our union with Him, but they are not in the enjoyment of this great position.<a name=383:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, on the other hand, those who believe that there is no deliverance, except in the life of Christ, have the unspeakable joy of being free from the law of sin and death.<a name=383:5></a> They can leave everything here to join Him in the assembly; they know Him as Son over God's house, in the holiest of all; untold blessing is theirs.<a name=383:6></a> When they learn what it is to be dead with Him from the rudiments of the world, they are with Him in His own home, where He directs and counsels them, and finally they are led by the Spirit of God to realise their union with Him in heaven; so that they come forth in full concert with His mind, and in the greatness of His power, to act for Him here in the church and in their own house.<a name=383:7></a> Thus we plainly see the importance of "Take heed .<a name=383:8></a>.<a name=383:9></a>.<a name=383:10></a> how ye hear".<a name=383:11></a> <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#8:18">Luke  8:18</a>.<a name=383:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As far as I see, the two women, Martha and Mary, at the end of <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10">Luke  10</a>, set forth in miniature the two classes of the new company which is described from chapter 11 to chapter 18: 30.<a name=384:8></a> Martha desires to minister to Him, but Mary is devoted to Him, and wants to be in the secret of His mind.<a name=384:9></a>

		Now let us look at some of the exercises to which the devoted heart is subjected.<a name=385:8></a> The first, as to moral magnitude, is when divine light shows you that Christ is rejected on the earth.<a name=385:9></a> This is in contradiction to the aim and effort of christendom which, in every circle of government, from the throne to the cemetery, is to persuade men that He is accepted and honoured; so that as a rule, everyone, with few exceptions, from men of the highest morality, intellect, and position, down to the unlearned peasant, is persuaded that He is acknowledged in His rightful place, and consequently that they can accept any honour in this place.<a name=385:10></a> This is a huge delusion!<a name=385:11></a> The exercise of the heart devoted to Christ is to refuse this, and to accept the place where He is accepted instead of the place where He is refused.<a name=385:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not easy to describe the immensity of the change, when in heart you leave your own place here for His place, the place which He has prepared for you; <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:3">John  14:3</a>.<a name=385:13></a> Things here, naturally beautiful and

	<div class="paragraph">
		The next exercise is as to the world.<a name=386:2></a> The more you seek to serve it, the less you are liked by it; you might be living on the best of terms with your neighbour, but when you make use of an opportunity to speak to him about his soul, he becomes distant and reserved, as if you had grievously offended him; so you have to learn that for your love you have hatred, and we are reminded of the Lord's words: "If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you", <a href="../bible/John.htm#15:18">John  15:18</a>.<a name=386:3></a> This comes as a surprise and pain to you, for you are estranged even from your nearest relatives if you are faithful to them, and not ashamed of Christ and His words: and however kind they may be naturally, you are made conscious that there is a great distance between you and them.<a name=386:4></a> Though you seem to do them little good, you feel that their influence with you is injurious; they have the power, which those who are less intimate with you have not, to revive old tastes and old impressions.<a name=386:5></a> Thus you are taught that "a man's foes shall be they of his own household" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#10:36">Matthew  10:36</a>), and your heart is not at ease until you are in practical isolation from them, and till it answers to the word: "forget also thine own people, and thy father's house; so shall the king greatly desire thy beauty", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#45:10">Psalm  45:10</a>,11.<a name=386:6></a> At the same time you ever cultivate great readiness to render them any service, indeed, as it becomes us, to "do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith", <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#6:10">Galatians  6:10</a>.<a name=386:7></a>

		It is humbling to see how many are not afraid to go forth to serve the Lord, like Gideon's army, who when tested by the water (the benefits of this life) fail in full devotedness, so that, as in that day, only a few, comparatively, remain to follow the Lord fully.<a name=387:4></a> These could accept the benefit (or earthly mercy) without being detained by it.<a name=387:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus in a double way you are drawn to Him, and the heart delighted in coming to Him, the living Stone, you find you are a component part of His assembly.<a name=388:6></a> To the one who is truly affected by the great fact of Christ's rejection from the earth, it is incomparable joy to find Him in His own assembly.<a name=388:7></a> It is not only that He draws you into His company in the holiest, in all the blessedness of His acceptance with God, but there you learn His pleasure as to His interests here on earth.<a name=388:8></a>

		The next exercise is as to the state of those who are following the Lord.<a name=389:3></a> The more your heart is devoted to Him, the more you will care for the advancement and blessing of His own.<a name=389:4></a> If you do not show this care for those near you, with whom you are walking in fellowship, you will not do so for those who are unknown to you; not that you would not show coldness and reserve when it was necessary, for it is right to show reserve to one who is walking unfaithfully: "have no company with him, that he may be ashamed" (<a href="../bible/2Thessalonians.htm#3:14">2 Thessalonians  3:14</a>) - but you would not cease to care for him.<a name=389:5></a> There is no real service without suffering; "we who live are always delivered unto death on account of Jesus".<a name=389:6></a> <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:11">2 Corinthians  4:11</a>.<a name=389:7></a>

		Lastly, there is a deep and continued exercise as to the way the saints are waiting for His coming.<a name=389:8></a> It has a very peculiar effect on you when you realise that the Lord has bought the field for the treasure in it.<a name=389:9></a> While naturally you would look at the beauties of it for your own pleasure, it now presents itself to you in a new aspect.<a name=389:10></a> As you are devoted to Him, His treasure is your paramount interest here, and your great aim will then be to reach that which was lost when the ruin began - first love.<a name=389:11></a> The Lord says to Ephesus, "Thou hast left thy first love", (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2:4">Revelation  2:4</a>) and necessarily, that is to leave the place where the Lord is.<a name=389:12></a> Paul has to say, "all they which are in Asia be turned away from me".<a name=389:13></a> (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1:15">2 Timothy  1:15</a>) You cannot enjoy His love if you are not in company with Him, and to be in company with Him is what your heart is set on if you are devoted to Him.<a name=389:14></a> Thus practically you have a little power, you keep His word, and do not deny His name; you are in heart the bride, whose affections are set upon Him as the bright and

		Every believer tries to be reformed, but, as far as I know, very few have apprehended the great moral difference between reformation and transformation.<a name=390:4></a> Believers as a rule rejoice that they are saved, and aim to be up to the language of <a href="../bible/Micah.htm#6:8">Micah  6:8</a>, "to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God".<a name=390:5></a> There are many who have accepted the truth, that by the grace of God the believer is transferred from Adam to Christ, and that they are clear of the old man in the sight of God, who do not think that they should give up their innocent pleasures and their natural interests; they have no true idea of what it is to be 'transformed'.<a name=390:6></a> If you analyse the two words, the meaning of each is plain enough.<a name=390:7></a> Reformation is improvement, and refers to what already exists; but transformation means a change of being.<a name=390:8></a> This, as far as I see, is little known.<a name=390:9></a>

		It would take too much time to go fully into it; all I desire is to awaken souls to the solemn fact that transformation is not accepting the good and refusing the evil only, but it is coming out in quite a new way on the earth.<a name=391:4></a> Everyone who knows anything of his own heart must know that he has tastes and desires connected with this earthly scene, and the more they are gratified the stronger they become; but as he walks in the Spirit he finds that what he likes most in the natural order of things is the very thing he must avoid: "No man .<a name=391:5></a>.<a name=391:6></a> .<a name=391:7></a> having drunk old wine straight-way desireth new; for he saith, The old is better".<a name=391:8></a> (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#5:39">Luke  5:39</a>)

		I do not merely allude to Romanism where the gospel and the church are both in the bonds of priestcraft, which starts with the idea that the church was founded on Peter, as if he were the Rock.<a name=403:3></a> Where this idea prevails there could, of course, be no real idea of the church of God.<a name=403:4></a> But it is not of Romanism I speak.<a name=403:5></a> I confine my remarks to the Reformed churches and the Nonconformist bodies, and I do not believe that any ministers in either one or the other, however faithful they may be in preaching the gospel as far as they know it, have the least conception of "the mystery of the gospel", which is the church.<a name=403:6></a> The best corroboration I can give to this statement is that, if they had any true idea of what the church is, they must take new ground - a ground open and common to every believer.<a name=403:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Twenty-five years ago there was a great evangelical movement which originated with two preachers in America, who pressed in a very popular way upon everyone to accept Christ, as if anyone could do so of himself.<a name=406:4></a> Of course, where there was a real work of God they were blessed, but many were so attracted and carried away by this movement that their interest in "the mystery of the gospel" ceased, and it became quite overlooked; so much so, that in 1873 I called attention in public to the danger of the church being lost sight of now that the gospel for the benefit of souls was absorbing such exclusive attention, and that the "mystery of the gospel" was ignored.<a name=406:5></a> None of those who were carried away by that movement progressed in the line of God's purpose.<a name=406:6></a>

		Now of late years, doubtless, the most insidious and effectual opposition to souls being led into the greatness of God's purpose has arisen from men of ability and intelligence in the Scriptures asserting that the whole range of God's purpose is the gift of His grace, which is true; but while they could speak of the great position to which God has called us, they ignored the subjective work of the Spirit, by which alone souls could be led into the power and enjoyment of it.<a name=406:7></a> It is quite true that all the range of God's purpose, from salvation to union with Christ, is the free gift of His grace, and to be apprehended by faith; so far, those to whom I refer were right in their statement; but

		the truth of God was neutralised and made ineffectual by the denial of the subjective work of the Spirit in the soul of the believer, so that all the great possessions spoken of were unavailable as to present appropriation.<a name=407:1></a> Now, while it is true that all is apprehended by faith, it is only the first link that is appropriated by faith; all the rest are to be appropriated by the Spirit.<a name=407:2></a> The first link is that God in His grace has removed the old man in judgment by the cross, and that everyone believing in Christ risen, is justified, and receives the Holy Spirit to assure him of the love of God.<a name=407:3></a> That is to be appropriated by faith; but the mistake is in supposing that the other links in this great chain can be appropriated, and consequently enjoyed by anyone (though through grace he has the right to all) except by the work of the Spirit of God in him; consequently as he by the Spirit enjoys each new position, he is in the power and blessing of it here.<a name=407:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		No form of opposition could more effectually deprive the word of its point and virtue, than to say that great possessions are given to us of God, and that, while on earth, to apprehend by faith that they are ours is enough; for if that were the truth we should get no distinct advantage from them now.<a name=407:5></a>

		In conclusion I would briefly call attention to the great advantage and blessing accruing to us as we enjoy the purpose of God for us, and the place of power and testimony in which it places us on earth.<a name=407:6></a> Every believer in Christ risen is, as we have seen, by God's grace transferred from Adam to Christ, and is assured by faith that he is a member of the body of Christ, even though he has not yet entered into the power and benefit which it confers.<a name=407:7></a> The second link is that if he is true to what baptism figuratively sets forth, he is "dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:11">Romans  6:11</a>); he has deliverance from himself, from this "wretched man"; he is in Christ; "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from

		It is current among all christians that if you are saved you go to heaven when you die; but that heaven is our place now, and the earth where we are is not our place, is little known.<a name=410:9></a> "The earth hath he given to the children of men"; (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#115:16">Psalm  115:16</a>) and perhaps there is nothing so difficult to inculcate on the believer as the fact that

		his title now is to heaven, to an entirely new place.<a name=411:1></a> Everyone naturally likes a place on the earth, and very often a person, though truly converted, thinks his claim to the earth is stronger, because he believes in God, and receives mercies from Him down here; hence the effect of being destined for an entirely new place is lost sight of, and practically the believer is much advanced in grace before he wholly breaks from the world and the things of it, and accepts the truth that the earth is not his place.<a name=411:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us trace the moral journey of the believer from the "far country" to that day when he can say
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<blockquote>'And see, the Spirit's power<br>Has ope'd the heavenly door,<br>Has brought me to that favoured hour<br>When toil shall all be o'er'.<a name=411:3></a></blockquote>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Every believer has been in the far country - away from God, using his substance - the natural gifts with which he was endowed - to minister to his own pleasure, his mind alienated from God by wicked works.<a name=411:4></a> When God by His sovereign grace, works in his soul, he is turned to God, and then the light of the gospel is unspeakable relief to him; he learns, like Israel in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#12">Exodus  12</a>, that because God sees the blood of Christ, he is safe from the judgment which is on the world and in the exercise of his soul, however little he may know of it doctrinally, he eats of the lamb roast with fire, with loins girded, and staff in hand, ready to leave Egypt.<a name=411:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The grace of God is that Christ not only gave Himself for our sins, but that He has also delivered us from this present evil age; but many do not for a long time get beyond the assurance of safety, and thus they are still in the presence of the enemy, typified by Pharaoh and all his host.<a name=411:6></a> They have not peace with God, and though they move on in a way, there is, as has been said, a large company at Pihahiroth; <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#14:2">Exodus  14:2</a>.<a name=411:7></a>

		Now when the light of the resurrection of Christ dawns on the believer, he learns that there is a way for him through the death and resurrection of Christ, as typified in the Red Sea, and there all the enemies are sunk like lead in the mighty waters; then he can say, "I will sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea".<a name=412:1></a> (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15:1">Exodus  15:1</a>).<a name=412:2></a> He can say, "Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God".<a name=412:3></a> (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:1">Romans  5:1</a>) Now he learns that heaven is "the hope of the gospel", as stated in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:5">Colossians  1:5</a>,23, and foreshadowed in the son (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15:17">Exodus  15:17</a>), "Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, in the place, O Lord, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have established".<a name=412:4></a> In the bright joy of salvation, the believer enters upon his new course in the world.<a name=412:5></a> Like Israel, he finds that there is no water to drink but Marah, which is really the water of the Red Sea; he has been filled with divine joy because he has been delivered from the judgment of death, and now his only true place on the earth is, baptised unto Christ's death.<a name=412:6></a> Death is our portion here; of this, baptism was the expression, and we have to accept death here, so that through Him we may walk in newness of life.<a name=412:7></a> Generally it is a long time before anyone really enters on this divine path.<a name=412:8></a> But as the believer is in fellowship with Christ in His death, as expressed in the breaking of bread, the bitterness of death is removed, and the heart that is truly devoted to Christ in His rejection, could not seek to live where He died.<a name=412:9></a> The language of the true heart is "Whither thou goest, I will go .<a name=412:10></a>.<a name=412:11></a>.<a name=412:12></a> where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried".<a name=412:13></a> (<a href="../bible/Ruth.htm#1:16">Ruth  1:16</a>, 17)

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When the divine path is not accepted, the tendency is either to enjoy oneself like the Corinthians, or to seek to keep the law, and to be made perfect in the flesh, like the Galatians; hence the wilderness is the test.<a name=413:3></a> God gave Israel the law in the wilderness to disclose the evil of man's heart, for "by the law is the knowledge of sin".<a name=413:4></a> (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3:20">Romans  3:20</a>) At the same time He gave Moses a pattern of things in the heavens, to show the nearness in which He would bring man to Himself.<a name=413:5></a> The great falling away in christendom is that while they own that there is no salvation but by the blood of Christ, they make the law the rule of life, and the approach to God by carnal ordinances; so that even by true christians the Lord's supper is regarded as a means of grace, and of benefit to the soul, in remembering the work done for it, but the idea of fellowship with Christ in His death is wholly lost sight of.<a name=413:6></a>

		Jesus, free from the law of sin and death, he is not only free from that wherein he was held, but he learns that by Christ there is a change of priesthood, that Christ is a Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.<a name=415:1></a> This we see in Hebrews; and as we seek to reach Him, the Forerunner, we find that not only are we freed from the law by the death of Christ, but by Christ, the Priest, we are raised above all the weakness of humanity; He bears us above it all, and draws us to Himself, as Peter learned in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#14">Matthew  14</a>.<a name=415:2></a> It was not there a question of his sins, but of entire superiority to himself, the human vessel, by being drawn to Christ; and as we know Christ at the other side of death, we not only know Him as Son over God's house, but we have boldness to enter into the holiest by Him, where we enjoy His acceptance in the presence of God.<a name=415:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But though the believer is thus in heavenly enjoyment, he still has to do with the difficulties and contrarieties of this scene.<a name=415:4></a> It is only when he learns the wonderful truth that he has died with Christ from the rudiments of the world, and that he is risen with Christ, and can heartily seek the things above where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God, that he has the sense that "the body of the flesh" has been removed in the death of Christ (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:11">Colossians  2:11</a>), so that he can enjoy the sphere of Christ's life.<a name=415:5></a> He has now reached heaven where Christ is, and then he learns of Him to do His pleasure here in His own circle; he is not exactly heavenly yet, but he tastes what heaven is, he has touched heavenly ground, he has crossed the Jordan, and he knows Christ as Head of the church.<a name=415:6></a>

		Now when you enter into the true meaning of the Lord's supper, that it is not remembering His death for yourself, but remembering Him in His death, you are in blessed freedom from all that is of yourself, you then truly remember Him in His death here, and your heart finds that your only true state in the place where He died is to be in fellowship with His death until He comes.<a name=419:3></a> But the more truly you are so, the more you rejoice to know Him in glory, exalted at the right hand of God; and though this experience may come after your knowing Him as the living Stone, yet you will find that fellowship with His death gives everything its true character to you here.<a name=419:4></a> And then you can turn undistractedly to Him who is Son of God over His house, and to the place where He is, and not only know the blessedness of your own association with Him as one of the consecrated company, but that in divine seclusion with Himself, with feet washed, separated from all the defilement here, you know what He is to His own on earth, as He sets it forth in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>.<a name=419:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The next step is one of inconceivable satisfaction, even surpassing the joy of salvation, when by the power which wrought in Christ and raised Him from the dead and set Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, you are conducted to Him in His own place, as Rebecca was conducted to Isaac; now you realise union with Him; the spiritual power with which you are endowed is fully detailed in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3">Ephesians  3</a>, "strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man; that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God".<a name=421:2></a>

		Lastly, you come forth from Him in heaven, to be His witness here on earth, as we learn in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4">Ephesians  4</a>, a new man, to be for Him in the assembly - in His circle; and in your own private circle.<a name=421:3></a> It is a moment of blessedness when you are Christ's witness here, in such superiority to the world that you demonstrate what it is morally, and you can stand for the Lord against all the power of Satan; the prince of this world is judged.<a name=421:4></a> Then, learning of future things, glorifying Him, your heart rests in the things that eye hath not seen nor ear heard, but which God hath revealed unto us by His Spirit.<a name=421:5></a> Thus you are properly waiting for the appearing of Christ.<a name=421:6></a> The rapture relieves you from this scene of contrariety, that you may take your place in His kingdom.<a name=421:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Next, as you know you are accepted by God in Christ, and that the old man is removed in judgment on the cross, so now by the Spirit of God you know that you are in Christ for your own comfort; you belong to Him and you are in liberty, freedom from the flesh, delivered from the old man.<a name=422:3></a> It is not yourself that is before you then, not Ishmael, but Isaac.<a name=422:4></a> "Christ liveth in me".<a name=422:5></a> When I am with Him above all the power of man He satisfies my love by drawing me to His side.<a name=422:6></a>

		CAN WORLDLY MEANS BE USED IN CHRIST'S SERVICE?
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The chief point to ascertain is Christ's present relation to this world; I suppose it would be admitted by all that He was rejected.<a name=423:2></a> The Jew used the law of God to condemn Him, and the Roman used the power which God gave man, to crucify the Son of God - to condemn the Holy One and the Just.<a name=423:3></a> Hence we read of the fulfilment of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#110">Psalm  110</a>, "Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool".<a name=423:4></a> As He said to Pilate, "My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence".<a name=423:5></a> (<a href="../bible/John.htm#18:36">John  18:36</a>) Now it is evident to any honest mind that He was rejected by this world: "They have both seen and hated both me and my Father".<a name=423:6></a> (<a href="../bible/John.htm#15:24">John  15:24</a>) The scripture is fulfilled, "They hated me without a cause".<a name=423:7></a> (<a href="../bible/John.htm#15:25">John  15:25</a>) The world is in a different relation to God since the rejection of Christ from that in which it was before His rejection.<a name=423:8></a> Before, it was lawful for a servant of God to use what was available of the power of the world to carry out the service of God.<a name=423:9></a> But, as far as I see, God never used natural things in His own service, except in a miraculous way, such as the ravens feeding the prophet, or the ass speaking with man's voice to rebuke the madness of the prophet.<a name=423:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next thing for us to be scripturally assured of, is that Christ has power fully to carry out His own work.<a name=423:11></a> Nothing can be more definite than this: "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth"; and,

		"lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world", <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28:18">Matthew  28:18</a> - 20.<a name=424:1></a> Now if we see that Christ was rejected from this world, and that He can carry on His work by His own power, there is no plea for using worldly things in any way to contribute to His service.<a name=424:2></a> We might rest here; but we have to contend with the great attempt in christendom all around us, to show that Christ is not rejected, but fully owned.<a name=424:3></a> One fact, not to speak of others, establishes this statement.<a name=424:4></a> The ringing of bells for divine service is evidently an imitation of the trumpets of the Jewish ritual; but to any thoughtful mind what a jargon it represents!<a name=424:5></a> A bell of various denominations calling aloud, in the hearing of everyone, on souls to worship God, thus using worldly means for this avowedly good end.<a name=424:6></a> This practice has no doubt led many earnest men to make use of public notices, and even at times to resort to the town crier, avowedly with the good intention of gathering souls to hear the gospel.<a name=424:7></a> It is not easy to eradicate this impression from the minds of christians, because it assumes to be in accordance with God's appointment for Israel.<a name=424:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now it must be plain to every godly soul, that according to Scripture, Christ has been rejected by the world, and that He has power in the fullest degree to maintain what is His own, altogether independent of the world.<a name=424:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Bear in mind that if there is a divine work of God in any soul, that soul is, by the reception of the Spirit, a member of the body of Christ.<a name=424:10></a> To this end the Lord commissioned the twelve who were the foundation of everything, to go forth and teach all nations, "baptising them to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit".<a name=424:11></a> (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28:19">Matthew  28:19</a>) It does not say that they were all gifted as preachers, but the preachers came from that company.<a name=424:12></a> An evangelist is one of the special gifts which by the Spirit is given to the church.<a name=424:13></a>

		He is sent to preach good tidings - "By the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe".<a name=425:1></a> (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:21">1 Corinthians  1:21</a>) The means bears no proportion to the result, simply because it is God's work.<a name=425:2></a> "The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth so is every one that is born of the Spirit".<a name=425:3></a> (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:8">John  3:8</a>) God begins the work in every soul.<a name=425:4></a> The light of the gospel only divinely reaches the soul that is born again, the one whom God has turned to Himself.<a name=425:5></a> It begins with fear, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#111:10">Psalm  111:10</a>) - like the thief on the cross, who says to his comrade, "Dost not thou fear God?<a name=425:6></a>" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#23:40">Luke  23:40</a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Once it is seen that the beginning of the work must be wholly with God, it must be evident that God will only use His own means to bring that soul into the light; therefore the simple duty of the evangelist is to be like Philip ready to be carried (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#8">Acts  8</a>) or like Paul at Philippi to be in prison, to announce the glad tidings to one anxious soul.<a name=425:7></a> This is fully confirmed when we see that there is nothing owned of God on the earth that is not of Christ - a member of His body.<a name=425:8></a> It is not as in former times when there could be individual saints on the earth.<a name=425:9></a> Seeing this is the place of Christ's rejection God could not now support anything here that is not of the rejected One - part of Him.<a name=425:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is an immense point to keep clearly before the soul, and thus it is plain that nothing can be acquired from the earth for any of His own.<a name=425:11></a> Every additional blessing must come direct from Himself.<a name=425:12></a> The evangelist is sent from the Lord with a message from Him with good tidings, and he must look to Him to guide him where he is to announce and make known the tidings.<a name=425:13></a> He should be always ready for it, whether in travelling or in the company of others, and he may be led to go to a house or a town to deliver the message; but he has no power unless he is consciously directed by the Lord.<a name=425:14></a> When he is so directed it may be that

		he may see no immediate result, but he has the comfort of knowing that he has done the Lord's will.<a name=426:1></a> I cannot see how in going to a town he is spiritually helped by announcing to the world - the public - his purpose in coming.<a name=426:2></a> It may be contended, how then could it be known?<a name=426:3></a> I reply, if the Lord has sent him, He will be sure to lead him to one and another, and when he has found acceptance with one like Cornelius, such an one will be glad to make it known to his neighbours and chief friends.<a name=426:4></a> It is happy for the evangelist to intimate his purpose in coming, as directed of the Lord, to his brethren, that they may have fellowship in his work by prayer; but as far as I see, the announcement of it to the public is in no way authorised by Scripture.<a name=426:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I quite believe that the gospel should come from the assembly, and therefore that where it meets, the gospel should be regularly preached; because we must bear in mind that we live among those who profess to be christians, and therefore the word to Timothy was, "Do the work of an evangelist", (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#4:5">2 Timothy  4:5</a>) indicating that they did not know the gospel though they had the profession of it.<a name=426:6></a> This is very different from great public evangelistic efforts and demonstration; and, as far as my knowledge goes, I have never heard of a thoroughly devoted servant being the fruit of these demonstrations.<a name=426:7></a> We hear of converts from them, but I ask, Where are the souls devoted to Christ?<a name=426:8></a> I believe when you come to the history of souls it will be found that where the work was deep it has been effected in a very silent and unseen way.<a name=426:9></a> Many confess to a limited gospel who would fear to do so to a full one, but it is the duty of an evangelist to present a full gospel.<a name=426:10></a> There was no knowledge of God in my father's house till I was nine years old, when a pious clergyman came to stay with him, and I remember his speaking from <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9">Acts  9</a>one evening.<a name=426:11></a> The point that arrested me was that God would send a light out of

		heaven to convert a soul!<a name=427:1></a> I only adduce this to show how little we know the particular word that may lay a living hold on the soul.<a name=427:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The work of an evangelist must be a deeply interesting one to us, when we remember that he comes from God to a dark soul, to present divine light to him, which is the beginning of divine knowledge in the soul which has already been the subject of the work of God.<a name=427:3></a> Very often converts bear a moral resemblance to the evangelist who has presented light to them according to his measure.<a name=427:4></a> As a rule, the work of an evangelist in any place is not accomplished in a day or two.<a name=427:5></a> Paul had to be admonished when he was inclined to leave Corinth, "I have much people in this city".<a name=427:6></a> (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#18:10">Acts  18:10</a>) I do not advocate periodical visits; that is more the province of the teacher; nor do I see that the evangelist is qualified, unless by a special gift, to take the place of a teacher, nor does he really understand the work of the Spirit in the assembly.<a name=427:7></a> It can be remarked that when an evangelist becomes a permanent resident in a place he loses his special power in his attempt to be a pastor or teacher.<a name=427:8></a> I have noticed that when an assembly is gathered by an evangelist, however earnest he may be, it does not understand what it is to be "built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:5">1 Peter  2:5</a>); and I have said to the evangelist, a very earnest, devoted man, that those whom he had gathered came together to be acted on, rather than to act - to be "the holy priesthood".<a name=427:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To sum up, it is plain that as the evangelist is sent of the Lord to accomplish a special work, he cannot solicit help or countenance from anything or anyone around him, except from those who are led of the Lord in prayer or otherwise.<a name=427:10></a> I would add - it is incongruous to ask for a public subscription for the circulation of the Bible.<a name=427:11></a> Such an appeal is devoid of a sense of the relation in which Christ stands to the world.<a name=427:12></a> Anyway, as to printing or otherwise, it should
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=428>[Page 428]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		be at the evangelist's own expense and that of those who love the Lord.<a name=428:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I need not add more, but the evangelist should come as sent of the Lord to seek His own; and as His own must be of Christ Himself; he must be confined exclusively to Christ, to receive only from Him, that he may be of real service to souls.<a name=428:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In christendom, this has resulted in systematised error.<a name=429:13></a> I will only adduce two examples of it: one, that though the judgment of man on the cross is believed in, there is no acceptance of the fact, that for

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The other example is, that while every believer accepts the Lord's supper, they make it a means of grace to themselves and have no thought of its being a remembrance of Him.<a name=430:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If it is once seen that the power of the truth is lost by adding our own opinions to it, we can easily trace how we may lose the power of it.<a name=430:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When Lot separated from Abraham, he did not leave Canaan, but he chose a spot for himself, and thus he lost the effect of the truth without denying it: he had a sad life and a bitter end.<a name=430:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We see it also in the case of the twelve spies: they brought up a good report of the land, but the opinion of the ten who were afraid was: "We be not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.<a name=430:5></a> And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched" (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#13:31">Numbers  13:31</a>,32), and therefore they fell under the judgment of God.<a name=430:6></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Every pious man in christendom believes that Christ bore the judgment of sin, but if you questioned him as to whether the man that sinned is removed and an entirely new man brought in, he will only admit that there is a moral change, that the bad is removed.<a name=430:10></a> Hence he can enjoy himself here as a man, satisfied with a good conscience and with a walk characterised by good conduct.<a name=430:11></a> Some would quote: "Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#51:10">Psalm  51:10</a>); but this is millennial and does not apply to the present time.<a name=430:12></a> And in the other example

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think it is important to see in these two examples, the result of the human mind adding to the word of God; for if you do not see that the old man is completely removed and Christ brought in, you will never get a true idea of what the new man is, and still more, you will have no divine conception of Christ personally, and therefore you never could understand what the church is as members of His body: "he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one".<a name=431:2></a> (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:11">Hebrews  2:11</a>) Hence, you must drop into the thought current in christendom, that Christ was made one of us, whereas the truth is that we are of Him.<a name=431:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I hope I have said enough to prove that the tendency, even of the believer, is, not to refuse the truth, but to qualify it and thus to vitiate it.<a name=431:4></a> Anyone who will carefully study the epistle to the Corinthians will see how the human mind engendered loss and failure in every circle from the house of God to our own house.<a name=431:5></a> But I must add that while in christendom every believer has faith in the blood of Christ, yet the one entangled therein does not reach the fulness of the gospel, because he sees only atonement - that is, the covering of sin - in the work of Christ.<a name=431:6></a> I corroborate this by stating that the word 'atonement' does not occur in the New Testament; the word for reconciliation is translated 'atonement' and thus by the intrusion of the human mind, the greatness of the truth of the gospel is lost.<a name=431:7></a>

		But I turn now to those who profess to have a full gospel, who believe that the man under judgment is gone in the cross of Christ and see that believing in Christ risen they are justified and have peace with God, who rejoice in the perfectness of their salvation and have received the Holy Spirit as the seal, and

		Now there is great joy and often great devotedness in knowing this much and yet many who know it do not know deliverance; they can believe that the man is gone from the eye of God in judgment in the cross, but they do not know in themselves that by the Spirit they are in Christ and are delivered from the body of this death, so that the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made them free from the law of sin and death.<a name=432:2></a> They have never really entered upon the new history that the old man is crucified and Christ liveth in them.<a name=432:3></a>

		In confirmation of this I would state that however fervent and devoted they are in setting forth what Christ has done, and the blessing that has resulted from all He did in coming to our side, they never can speak of going to His side, or of having part in His things, and hence though they are separate from the world and cultivate amiability and graciousness of manner, they are not separate from the earth and things on the earth, as having fellowship with Christ's death here, and thus the place where He is, is not really the anchoring ground of their souls.<a name=432:4></a> They are deprived of all these great blessings of God's grace because of putting a human interpretation on <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>, that because God sees you clear of the old man in the cross, you, by the reckoning of faith, can see yourself clear.<a name=432:5></a>

		Many years ago there was a meeting in London of young men desiring to be in Christ's service, and each had to write a sheet of note paper on one or two verses, not merely telling of the subject of the passage, but of the importance of every word, adverb or conjunction, and this in order to get a clear idea of the plenary inspiration of Scripture.<a name=434:2></a>

		Every earnest soul expects, as he reads the word, not to remember all he has read, but to receive something specially from the Lord; and it is a well-known fact that everyone walking with the Lord receives from Him fresh light on the scriptures best known to him, while on the other hand we find that those who are declining can repeat old thoughts on Scripture, but have nothing fresh from it, as we read in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#11:17">Deuteronomy  11:17</a>, the first mark of departure from the Lord was that they had "no rain".<a name=434:3></a>

		New Testament, where the word ought to be 'reconciliation', we read "atonement", and thus reconciliation is really limited to atonement, whereas it means a great deal more.<a name=435:1></a> It is said in one of the articles: 'Christ reconciles us to the Father', whereas even in the parable (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15">Luke  15</a>) the father was reconciled before he kissed the prodigal.<a name=435:2></a> In my own time I remember the title 'gospel of the glory' was refused as an innovation, whereas in truth the innovation is the limitation given to it by man.<a name=435:3></a> More than thirty years ago, a young man proposing at the monthly Bible reading to consider the gospel of the glory, it was objected to by two, who I am sure would not do so now; and at that time I have known an evangelist decline to go to a meeting, alleging that he did not know the gospel of the glory, and regarded it as something visionary.<a name=435:4></a> After some commotion about it, the most devoted servant of the day stood up to give an address, stating, 'I wish to speak this evening of the gospel of the glory, and rightly called the gospel of the glory'.<a name=435:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we see that human interpretation of the truth naturally leads to resistance and opposition to the full meaning of it.<a name=435:6></a> As lately, the opposition as to the gift of eternal life arose from the general idea that it is given at new birth, instead of seeing that, as in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>, it is given with the Spirit: "he breathed into them, and says to them, Receive the Holy Spirit".<a name=435:7></a>

		And still more seriously the last phase of the church (Laodicea) seems to have affected some who began well: they contended that all the purpose of God's grace was free gift and not attainment, and were so far right.<a name=435:8></a> They allowed they could see it by the Spirit, but they overlooked new creation and the subjective work of the Spirit in them, so that men could talk of title and great things without really knowing them practically.<a name=435:9></a> The prodigal son not only knew his father's favour to him, but he was made personally fit to enjoy his presence.<a name=435:10></a> It would have been vain for
