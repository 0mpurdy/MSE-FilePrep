		I do not deny that it has a place in your minds, as well as in your affections, but more in the latter than in the former; that is, while your affections entertain it, you are not so ruled by it that your minds would be coloured by it, and all your work in purpose bearing on it.<a name=11:3></a> You may say that you are by gift evangelists, so was Paul.<a name=11:4></a> You may say -- we hope to get to it.<a name=11:5></a> Now in divine things there is no possibility of making that straight which is already crooked; there is no such thing as growing out of a deformity, or an impaired constitution, save and except by renouncing that which caused the damage, and starting anew, one by one, according to the light now vouchsafed.<a name=11:6></a> I mean for instance that no amount of teaching can raise a Baptist congregation into the truth of the assembly of God.<a name=11:7></a> To be in the truth of the assembly of God you must gather with God, and by Him, apart from conventionalism.<a name=11:8></a> You know very well that it is the aim which gives a character and a colour to all one's energies and ways in seeking to attain to it.<a name=11:9></a> Is the filling up of Christ's body -- the true aim of the Holy Ghost according to the heart of Christ and the purpose of God, <i>your</i> aim -- your <i>simple</i> aim -- as simple that it is your commanding aim?<a name=11:10></a> I do not for the moment ask you to see, if there is any one else on the road with you (though Timothy was told to look out for those who had <i>preceded</i> him on the road), because I know that

		It is not God's way, I say it without hesitation, to allow any one to step down to a lower standing than the one he assumed to take, in order to escape the consequence of failure in the higher standing.<a name=14:1></a> I never encourage any one to take the standing that we have assumed to take; though I know that it is <i>most blessed</i>, and the only one for the witness.<a name=14:2></a> Yet, I tremble, and, if I dare, would dissuade some who essay to join with us.<a name=14:3></a> We seek to be overcomers, taking the van against all comers, desiring to gather all the saints out of the present confusion; but if they come, they must do as we ought to do, -- with lusty sinews buffet the waves which are running high against us.<a name=14:4></a> Any one who takes the standing will be judged according to it.<a name=14:5></a> Lot takes the standing of Canaan, and is judged, not as if he were still in Mesopotamia, but as in Canaan.<a name=14:6></a> I treat Independents as Independents, but Brethren I do not treat as Independents, even when, in conduct and mind, they have degenerated to that.<a name=14:7></a> It is simply not God's way to treat them as such.<a name=14:8></a> They themselves deny that they are independents, and it is only by force of an unwise amiability that you reduce them to the level of Independents, in order that you may be able to mete out to them a milder judgment.<a name=14:9></a> The trials and difficulties which in unbelief we try to avoid, we may be sure, are the very ones we shall fall into, and some day or other you will find that you must deal in discipline, on the ground of the assembly; and the difficulties which now you think you escape from, by reducing a company of saints avowedly on the ground of the assembly, to that of Independents, will not serve you at another time which your present laxity is sowing the seed of in your own borders nearer home.<a name=14:10></a> For if we would be faithful, and yet seek, and embrace a compromise where there is a demand on us to be faithful, God in His righteousness must make a much severer demand on us next time; for if He does not, we sink down into the ruins around us.<a name=14:11></a> It would be a much

		SAVED FOR THE CHURCH
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think it is not too much to say that souls are saved here with reference to the church; "And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:47">Acts  2:47</a>).<a name=15:9></a> They are not only saved for heaven, but are destined for a position <i>on earth</i> for Christ.<a name=15:10></a> The weakest member is necessary.<a name=15:11></a> I should quote that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places may be known <i>by the church</i> the manifold wisdom of God.<a name=15:12></a> I can suppose that this theology would be very objectionable to a mere revivalist; 'Conversion of souls everything, and the church nothing' is the evil we have especially to contend against in this day.<a name=15:13></a> In God's sovereign grace and wisdom souls are often saved on death beds; but even so, they are of the church now, and nothing else; and if they were continued here they ought to be found acting and living here as of it -- members of Christ's body.<a name=15:14></a> I do not believe that an evangelist has done his true work unless he has so presented Christ to a soul, that that soul may in the power of the Spirit through faith know itself as of Christ; and if of Christ it is of His body on earth, though it may not yet have intelligence as to this.<a name=15:15></a> Without doubt God

		Is there a separate or distinct class of converted ones now irrespective of the church?<a name=16:3></a> Nothing of the sort.<a name=16:4></a> Every one converted now is in God's mind a member of the body of Christ, and the true evangelist will see to it that he is "planted", and in the building.<a name=16:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul says, I planted -- Apollos watered.<a name=16:6></a> It is, I think, one of the most trying anomalies of the present day that many souls are known to be converted who are never heard of again, and though they are netted, and surely preserved by God in His unfailing mercy, yet they are not known here as belonging to Christ; and they have not here either a "father" or a "nurse", see <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#2">1 Thessalonians  2</a>.<a name=16:7></a> The duty of the evangelist is to hand the stone into the hands of the pastor, as a hodsman would pass on a stone to a mason.<a name=16:8></a>

		There is no evangelist among the gifts in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>, because it is the body which is there presented, but when the Head is before us the evangelist is one of the gifts for the perfecting of the saints (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:11">Ephesians  4:11</a>, 12).<a name=16:9></a>

		The path is narrow, but daily I am more satisfied and assured that if we would know the presence and mind of our absent Lord we must be on the martyr line.<a name=16:10></a> The evangelical line may <i>lead</i> to this; the 'no system' line may <i>lead</i> to it, but it is not <i>it</i>!<a name=16:11></a>

		I feel it a great mercy that the Lord regards the intent, and blesses accordingly; and though the same words may be uttered by two, yet if one had a deeper and more spiritual intent in them than the other, though the Lord may in a measure bless both, that the deeper and fuller blessing will be where the deepest and most spiritual intent is.<a name=62:3></a> The spirit, not the letter of the statement, is the essence of it.<a name=62:4></a> If the spirit or essence be evil, no amount of sweetness or dilution in the vehicle will counteract the effects of the poison; but, thank God, if the essence be of the mind of God, though the vehicle be unattractive and even insufficient, it will speak for itself.<a name=62:5></a> My judgment is that no amount of useful or orthodox statements should warrant me to circulate the writings of one who at the time is under an evil bias, for though he may indite such apparently good things, yet there must be a poison in his mind which sooner or later will betray itself.<a name=62:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/John.htm#14:17">John  14:17</a> is very plain in the original; the reading literally is that the Spirit "abides with you" (the company), "and shall be in you" -- remaining with you, in contrast to Christ's going away; "He shall be in you" is the <i>way</i> He would be here.<a name=80:3></a> I quite see the importance of maintaining the distinction between the presence of the Spirit of God in the individual and in the assembly of the living God.<a name=80:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The assembly is God's habitation by the Spirit.<a name=80:5></a> This cannot be denied.<a name=80:6></a> The question is -- could the Spirit be there apart from the vessel, which, in my judgment, you rightly deny.<a name=80:7></a> I see that the Holy Ghost is quite distinct in His operation in the individual and in the assembly.<a name=80:8></a> I believe that if the Spirit has been occupying you with your own state up to your entering the meeting, that He would then and there occupy you with your privileges and responsibilities in the assembly.<a name=80:9></a> In John's gospel the operation of the Spirit in the individual (chapters 4 and 7) is distinct from the operation of the Spirit in the company; chapters 14: 26 and 15: 26.<a name=80:10></a> It has helped me that in chapter 15: 26 the Lord says, "The Comforter .<a name=80:11></a>.<a name=80:12></a>.<a name=80:13></a> whom I will send unto you" -- the <i>eleven</i>; He is not sent to the world, and hence I see that any one who had been in the assembly, as in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14">1 Corinthians  14</a>, and had been where the Holy Ghost was, whether with two or a million, would be a "companion of the Holy Ghost", and an apostate if he ever returned to Judaism.<a name=80:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As far as I see, I judge a servant may be useful in his ministry although he does not consciously know the Head, and the more he waits on the Lord the clearer is his spiritual judgment, and blessing in proportion is vouchsafed; but this, though better understood, is evidently a long way from the blessedness of being directed by the Head; and, of course, you cannot be directed by Christ as Head if you do not know Him as such.<a name=81:9></a>

		STEWARDSHIP

	<div class="paragraph">
		... I see that it is not my place to inquire what I can afford, but what I can dispense with; and I find the study of this and the practice of it, in any little way, preserves me from care as to temporal things.<a name=87:8></a> As to stewardship, as to fact, your property is the Lord's, as you see in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#16">Luke  16</a>.<a name=87:9></a> The Jew was the steward, and he proved unfaithful.<a name=87:10></a> The Gentile, in that sense, was never a steward, and as to title to property, he has none.<a name=87:11></a> No one could set up a divine title to property.<a name=87:12></a> The Jew had title, but through unfaithfulness he is reduced to the level of a Gentile.<a name=87:13></a> As to the legal fact, the property is the Lord's, and hence to the converted one it becomes a <i>gift</i> to him: Peter says, "As every man has received the <i>gift</i>.<a name=87:14></a>.<a name=87:15></a>.<a name=87:16></a>.<a name=87:17></a>" It is given to him, and faithfulness in the use of it, as with any other gift, is required.<a name=87:18></a> The grace of the Lord is especially connected with this gift, for, though the property be the Lord's, as you see in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#16">Luke  16</a>, yet if you so spend it as to make friends by it (cheering and succouring others through the means of it), you <i>gain</i> through means of a property which is not really yours, but the Lord's.<a name=87:19></a> All the gain is yours, though the property, as to title, belongs to the Lord; and hence it is added, "If ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?<a name=87:20></a>" The spiritual gift is that which is our own.<a name=87:21></a> The temporal gift is given in

		the providence of God, and the proper exercise of it determines whether the one who receives it would be faithful in the greater gifts; I believe in one sense there is no gift more difficult to use rightly than money.<a name=88:1></a> To be a donor requires close and careful acquaintance with the person and ways of the one to whom I give.<a name=88:2></a> If I promote worldliness, or afford him ability to have things which he could do without, by my gift I injure him.<a name=88:3></a> I feel it necessary and good discipline, to be just as restricted when I have much as when I have little, and though I am not given to be a donor, yet unknown, the Lord allows me to help if a case of pressure comes before me.<a name=88:4></a>

		I have looked at the passage where "faithful men" occurs, and it seems plain that there is but one condition attached, namely, sufficient or "competent to teach others also".<a name=152:12></a> Quite true, the epistle is addressed to a servant, but if I hear what is the true service of a servant, I know at least what I am called to do.<a name=152:13></a> I do not think that the idea of a soldier is that one is to have no secular work.<a name=152:14></a> See 2 Thessalonians.<a name=152:15></a> Surely Timothy worked with his hands there.<a name=152:16></a> The idea of a soldier is that he is ready to leave everything to obey orders.<a name=152:17></a> It may apply to a man marrying, but certainly not to secular business.<a name=152:18></a> Paul can leave Ephesus when business was good, and he stays at Thessalonica when it was bad.<a name=152:19></a> Business was not the paramount thing, but service.<a name=152:20></a> This should be always the case.<a name=152:21></a>

		THE DUTY OF THE ASSEMBLY. TO BRETHREN IN THE LORD AT --------
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Will you permit me to lay before you two considerations which I believe will help you to a right judgment in the -------- matter.<a name=182:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First.<a name=182:11></a> In everything connected with the assembly we are sure to err, if we do not keep in mind its rights and duties.<a name=182:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The assembly is the Lord's company, and we cannot interfere with it, but under His direction.<a name=182:13></a> If I have the Lord simply before my mind in the assembly, I regard everything there with reference to Him.<a name=182:14></a> There can be no indifference there.<a name=182:15></a> The prophets are to speak, two or three, and the others to judge (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14:29">1 Corinthians  14:29</a>, New Trans.<a name=182:16></a>).<a name=182:17></a> Judging is a duty.<a name=182:18></a> The assembly is not a republic.<a name=182:19></a> "Let all things be done decently and in order" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14:40">1 Corinthians  14:40</a>).<a name=182:20></a> The greatest authority, the Holy Ghost, is here.<a name=182:21></a> God is not the author of confusion.<a name=182:22></a> The assembly is required to respect and appreciate the ministry and food supplied to it (see <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#5:13">1 Thessalonians  5:13</a>).<a name=182:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=183>[Page 183]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I admit that it is those who have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints -- those who take the oversight, who are the ostensible agents of this care; all I say is, that the <i>care</i> should exist in <i>every</i> assembly, and that when it is neglected in any assembly, the saints there have failed in their duty, at all events.<a name=183:1></a> Surely in any respectable house the responsible servants could not allow that ill-cooked or unwholesome food should be served up to their master's guests.<a name=183:2></a> I maintain therefore that -------- <i>intended</i> rightly (however they failed in details) in refusing a ministry which did not edify.<a name=183:3></a> No one doubts, that I have heard of, on any side, that the ministry was unprofitable.<a name=183:4></a> Now if the assembly at -------- was bound to refuse this ministry, you are not keeping the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace if you accept it, nor is any one who accepts it, because if a brother be under <i>church</i> censure in <i>one</i> place, he is under church censure in every place.<a name=183:5></a> You may try to remove the censure, but if you ignore it without expostulation, you dishonour the Lord.<a name=183:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Secondly.<a name=183:7></a> Let me ask you, are you sensible of the gravity of division?<a name=183:8></a> The assembly cannot be divided as a field.<a name=183:9></a> In a division the Head cannot go with both parts.<a name=183:10></a> The Lord goes with one side only -- He cannot go with both.<a name=183:11></a> Then the issue is very solemn, and be assured, if the Lord be not with you, though you may preserve a fair character and an unblemished reputation, and though you may be blessed in the gospel, your light and knowledge of His mind is sure to wane.<a name=183:12></a> I have seen it over and over that even godly souls when they lose the presence of the Lord in their midst never receive any fresh light from Him.<a name=183:13></a> They are alive but dwarfs.<a name=183:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I feel as if the Lord were helping us to understand many things which we had accepted in the scriptures, but the <i>size</i> of which morally we had very little apprehension of at first.<a name=184:5></a> The more we see the more we have to see; it is the one and the same country and Person, but exploring and acquaintance with them have immensely increased them to us.<a name=184:6></a> I am cheered by your prosperity at --------.<a name=184:7></a> I have been grieved to hear that there has been an attempt more than once to assert <i>right</i> to minister in the assembly.<a name=184:8></a> This is simply republican.<a name=184:9></a> If not resisted in divine power it will increase.<a name=184:10></a>

		PUTTING AWAY
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First let me say that I cannot see that <a href="../bible/2Thessalonians.htm#3">2 Thessalonians  3</a>applies to the same case as <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5">1 Corinthians  5</a>.<a name=184:11></a> I do not understand the former as putting away.<a name=184:12></a> It is rather discipline in the house.<a name=184:13></a> <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5">1 Corinthians  5</a>is distinctly of the positive kind -- putting away; and certainly I should treat a man who would not work with his hands in a very different way from that in which I am required to treat one who is put away.<a name=184:14></a> I am sure you will agree with me that putting away is the most solemn act, it is like a man undergoing amputation in order to preserve his body from the poison in the diseased member; and this he submits to, though the operation costs him much suffering and loss; but there is <i>no help for it</i>.<a name=184:15></a> Now this is putting away "from among yourselves", and we feel the pain of it, but we accede to it as required, in order to preserve
	</div>

		<a name=185>[Page 185]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		from the leaven.<a name=185:1></a> It is a solemn, painful act and everything ought to be done to prevent the necessity of such an act; but the necessity being established, and the act done, there remains now nothing but to seek the restoration of the one put away.<a name=185:2></a> How that is to be sought -- becomes the question between you and me.<a name=185:3></a> I do not think the case which you adduce of the lost sheep or the prodigal is in point.<a name=185:4></a> The prodigal is not the case of a backslider; for then it would be grace that he had squandered; the thing that he squandered was never restored to him, an entirely new thing was conferred on him.<a name=185:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe it quite right to seek, by prayer, the restoration of the one put away, nor do I mean to say that there should be no advance by visiting of a purely pastoral nature, where there is grace for it.<a name=185:6></a> One so led of the Lord would help the assembly and not act in despite of it.<a name=185:7></a> But I do think the advances for return to fellowship ought to begin with the one who has been put away.<a name=185:8></a> I think his sorrow is to indicate to the assembly these advances, and that his first advances ought to be to the assembly.<a name=185:9></a> I do not understand putting away by the assembly, and individuals by their advances giving the impression that they are more loving, and more tender than the assembly, thus obtaining for themselves favour in the eyes of the one put away at the expense of the assembly, and really annulling and depreciating their own most solemn and holy act; making out that they are individually less stringent than they are collectively.<a name=185:10></a> I believe --------'s restoration has been greatly retarded by individuals giving him this impression.<a name=185:11></a> He has really only to do with the assembly, and his first advances ought to be to it, and he ought to refuse advances from individuals.<a name=185:12></a> If he has respect to Christ's order on earth and His discipline, his true course is in repentance to seek re-admission to the circle of His interests, and to wait on God for it; and then I, for one, should feel free to visit him because his case was before the saints, and as he had prayed them to entertain his re-admission, I, as one of them, might now, without in any way impugning their act of discipline, call on him, or see him, in order to be assured before God of his state.<a name=185:13></a> It would be now no longer a case under discipline, but

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		a case for restoration; the discipline having proved sufficient, or at least there would be this hope.<a name=186:1></a> The beginning of repentance is the soul repudiating the nature that had exposed itself, and not the mere act of exposure.<a name=186:2></a> I quite feel with you and desire to mourn with you that there is 'not more longing of heart going out unto God for the banished ones', but until the assembly remits the discipline it would ill become me to ignore what the assembly has done; and thus make myself not of it.<a name=186:3></a> The act of putting away is the gravest, and if you see the gravity of it, you must see that to recall that act must be most solemn, and indeed the most blessed act for the church, for it is of grace.<a name=186:4></a>

		SPIRITUAL JUDGMENT NEEDED TO DISCERN WHAT IS SPIRITUAL
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Your letter followed me here.<a name=186:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The most powerful human mind, however exercised on scripture, cannot apprehend the mind of God respecting His own revelations.<a name=186:6></a> If we say we have fellowship -- common mind -- with God and walk in darkness, we lie and do not the truth; and surely if one has not the mind of God all one's thoughts are vain, or worse.<a name=186:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now if any one is walking in nature he cannot apprehend the mind of God, and it is worse than presumption his assuming to do so.<a name=186:8></a> The first action in nearness to God is the action of light -- exposing all that is unsuitable to Him; after light has done its work, then there is communion.<a name=186:9></a> Now if I see men walking in nature -- not wickedness, but in self, then I know that their spiritual judgment must be defective.<a name=186:10></a> Each and all of J.<a name=186:11></a>N.<a name=186:12></a>D.<a name=186:13></a>'s opponents come under this head.<a name=186:14></a> They have fallen into the snare of the hour -- the reckless attempt of grasping the mind of God by the natural mind being exercised on the word.<a name=186:15></a>

		One word more.<a name=187:5></a> As to your objection to what J.<a name=187:6></a>N.<a name=187:7></a>D.<a name=187:8></a> says about the Lord's sympathy with the remnant, you do not seem to me to understand what sympathy is.<a name=187:9></a> To be able to sympathise you require to have suffered as deeply, or more deeply, than the one whom you sympathise with, and at the same time to be so free from all suffering on your own account as to be able to throw yourself into his circumstances, and identify yourself in spirit with his sufferings.<a name=187:10></a> Our Lord had not passed through death, or endured bereavement in the ordinary sense, when He sympathised with Mary at the grave of Lazarus, but He felt death more deeply than she did.<a name=187:11></a> I believe that the great difficulty in discerning this question, as to the Lord's personal sufferings, arises from not seeing the Son's scope of action in doing the will of God.<a name=187:12></a> He made all things at first.<a name=187:13></a> Man in God's image was the last made -- the finish!<a name=187:14></a> He comes to earth of which He was the Creator, taking the very weakest place -- that of a Babe: not for man merely, though <i>to</i> man, not to God merely, but <i>for</i> God.<a name=187:15></a> He takes away the sin of the world, He enters into every incongruity here, in holy unswerving appreciation of what was due to God.<a name=187:16></a> Wherever grace is the new creation is, and as it works in those who are subjects of it, there the Lord knows and understands His own virtues -- what their value is, and what they have to contend with.<a name=187:17></a> He forms and sustains His own nature in that which is under judgment, even a judgment which in infinite grace He bore.<a name=187:18></a> He thus knows both one and the other.<a name=187:19></a>

		FELLOWSHIP IN THE GOSPEL WITH THOSE NOT IN CHURCH FELLOWSHIP HOW FAR MAY I GO WITH THEM?

	<div class="paragraph">
		I hear that there is a question raised, how far we ought, in preaching the gospel, to co-operate with saints with whom we are not in fellowship.<a name=221:1></a> The question would never arise, in my judgment, were those called 'brethren' alive to the peculiar position and testimony to which they are committed.<a name=221:2></a> We are, through grace, properly a remnant, led to see the true calling of the church.<a name=221:3></a> We are essentially a few who have emerged out of the general departure which first broke out extensively -- when the apostle could say, "all they which are in Asia be turned away from me" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1:15">2 Timothy  1:15</a>).<a name=221:4></a> There was a general defection from the truth committed to Paul, and that has continued ever since.<a name=221:5></a> Now God in His infinite mercy has enlightened some of us to see how we had fallen, and we have received in measure the light and truth which were given to the church at first.<a name=221:6></a> We are not an improvement on the sections in Christendom.<a name=221:7></a> We are, or we purpose to be, the only company of saints who contend for the truth committed to the apostle of the Gentiles -- our apostle.<a name=221:8></a>

		Our calling, characteristically, is not evangelical.<a name=221:9></a> We are called to set forth to our fellow-saints the vocation wherewith all saints are called.<a name=221:10></a> I do not say there are not to be evangelists among us, far from it, but I do say, that in my judgment, it is not our greatest duty.<a name=221:11></a> The evangelist among us who forgets the colours, as I might say, which he has assumed, departs from the <i>highest favour now conferred of God</i>.<a name=221:12></a> I hold that enlightenment as to what is due to Christ by His body on earth is, next to conversion, the greatest favour given of God in this day.<a name=221:13></a> I feel, and am assured, that the evangelist among us, has a much higher duty than even fulfilling the duties and functions of his gift.<a name=221:14></a> He is in a different position to the evangelists who are in the thick of "all in Asia" still.<a name=221:15></a> He has been led to revert to the testimony of the Lord and of His prisoner, and this badge or colour he must

		He desires to do his duty as an evangelist, and every saint, loving the Lord, would gladly aid him, but neither he nor those who have received light as to the claims Christ has on them, as His body on earth, which is Himself, will consent, much less offer to co-operate with "all in Asia".<a name=222:4></a> They wish to serve, to break the enemy's lines, but they will not consent to wear plain clothes, so to speak, they are too loyal for that.<a name=222:5></a> If they are not accepted in their true colours, and their proper regimentals and armour, they prefer, however insignificant it may make them appear, to be unattached, or at least only a little garrison.<a name=222:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is, I say, with deep and deepening conviction, a departure from our highest duty and allegiance to Christ, to co-operate with those opposed to or ignorant of what is due to Him on earth, in order to bless man.<a name=222:7></a> Man is thus preferred to Christ, and souls are hindered and checked by their own unfaithfulness.<a name=222:8></a> I should not hinder others from doing all they could, but I must not weaken the testimony in order to assist them, and thus neutralise my higher duty.<a name=222:9></a>

		WORK FOR THE LORD
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to work for the Lord, the simple inquiry for us is that which is recorded as the first utterance of Paul to our Lord, "Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?<a name=223:1></a>" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:6">Acts  9:6</a>).<a name=223:2></a> That is the duty and expression of every one who is distinctly awakened to the claim that Christ has on him.<a name=223:3></a> He feels 'I am taken out of the world, and I am given to Christ, and hence I look to Him for my place and occupation <i>in it</i>.<a name=223:4></a>' If we are given to Christ out of the world, it is evident that it is He alone who has right to determine our way and course <i>in the world</i>.<a name=223:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If I believe that I am given to Him out of the world, I have no right to re-occupy any place or position which I had previously held in the world.<a name=223:6></a> True, He does not require or permit me to infringe on any legal lord under whom I was held before I was given to Him; vested legal rights are not to be compromised because of my being given to Christ, but I am Christ's bondsman, and if I am, both from duty and inclination, my inquiry must necessarily be, "Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?<a name=223:7></a>" The more I own and realise the relationship which now exists through grace between Him and me, the more simply and continuously will this be my wholehearted cry to Him.<a name=223:8></a> Now, if it be so, I shall, of course, accede to and attend to whatever He may intimate to me, and this only.<a name=223:9></a> That is, the heart devoted to Him, and truly making this request, will <i>wait</i> on Him for guidance and counsel, and will find no real satisfaction in being anywhere or doing anything which is not according to His mind; our place and our occupation here would thus be wholly determined by the pleasure of Him whose we are and whom we serve.<a name=223:10></a>

		Nothing is so simple and nothing so important in my walk down here as that I belong to Christ, and I find it my happiness and His pleasure to do nothing but as He desires and instructs me.<a name=224:1></a> I live where He likes, and I do what He likes.<a name=224:2></a> If we did this there would be no mistakes on one side or on the other.<a name=224:3></a> But we <i>do</i> make mistakes on both sides; on one side at one time, and on another side at another time.<a name=224:4></a> At one time we <i>plan</i> out work for ourselves, and at another we do none.<a name=224:5></a> Now the first defect is the most difficult to deal with, simply because the counterfeit deceives one, and hence, while it is comparatively easy to convict the idle and slothful, it is not so easy to convict the active Martha that she is unwisely occupied.<a name=224:6></a> The work seems so right and so necessary, that it appears almost impossible that there could be any plan in it.<a name=224:7></a> Nothing so deceives and leads astray as the conscience working at a distance from Christ; for instance, if I feel in my conscience that I ought to be Christ's servant (true enough, I am His bondsman), but if I am not near Him, if I am not in His confidence, I may begin to do something to satisfy my conscience, and if so I do it legally, and not as what simply suits Him.<a name=224:8></a> I do it to make my conscience easy and satisfied.<a name=224:9></a> When this is the case I do not consult what <i>He</i> would like me to do, but I do what <i>I</i> think best to be done.<a name=224:10></a> It is not His pleasure that guides me, it is my own mind, as to what is suitable and proper.<a name=224:11></a> It may be quite a necessary service as Martha's was, but Martha was evidently thinking of the services which were incumbent on her to render, and was not governed by the pleasure of Christ.<a name=224:12></a>

		Here is where we fail -- undertaking to serve where it is in a degree creditable to ourselves, and we thus get disappointed (if we are true-hearted) because we have not the acknowledgment of His pleasure.<a name=224:13></a> How can He acknowledge what we have undertaken and done to satisfy our own conscience and what we ourselves judge to be suitable?<a name=224:14></a> It is evident when I am occupied with services, however useful and necessary, which I have undertaken of myself, feeling that they devolve upon me, that I must lose the sense of His presence.<a name=224:15></a> I am not sitting at His feet, Mary-like.<a name=224:16></a> There is no growth in Christ.<a name=224:17></a> Self is in

		I never met with any one making his service prominent who knew what it was to sit at the Master's feet; but, thank God, I know indefatigable workers who enjoy sitting at His feet above any service, and it is clear that those who sit most at His feet must be most competent to serve, and most in His confidence, which, after all, is <i>the clue</i> to all efficient service.<a name=225:9></a>

		<a name=238>[Page 238]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		gospel of the grace of God from and in the revival movement.<a name=238:1></a> In the revival there was an appeal to the senses of men, with, at the same time a presentation of the gospel of free grace: human energy was used to produce a sense of need, and an acceptance of the offer made.<a name=238:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a distinction as to the lines of teaching between the evangelical churchman and the evangelical dissenter; the former, while preaching forgiveness through the blood of Christ, is leavened and fettered by the system and ceremonial with which he is connected, and cannot lead his converts outside man or what addresses man in the flesh, and hence, though really believing in the atonement made by Christ, their standard, their perfect Man, even when they do not make the law the standard and rule of life to themselves, is Christ as having fulfilled the law; not Christ the heavenly Man on entirely new ground, and hence they either drop into ritualism, which is their proper terminus, or they buoy up their conscience by resisting the inroads of it, like mariners at the pump of a sinking ship.<a name=238:3></a> Now, the evangelical dissenter is not hampered by any liturgy or definite articles, and hence he, while preaching the sacrifice of Christ, supplies what he has lost in leaving the Establishment by seeking instead the reform of man.<a name=238:4></a> That is, he looks for a renovation of man in the Adamic state, and considers that all the tastes and abilities of man in the flesh are good in themselves and are spiritual gifts; so that, instead of the truth that another -- a new man has come in Christ, it is with them that the sins of the old man having been taken away by Christ, man is beautiful in himself, and that every improvement in society is tending to the spiritual reign of man in moral perfection.<a name=238:5></a> It is remarkable how in politics the churchman is conservative and the dissenter a reformer, expecting improvement and progress by change.<a name=238:6></a> The saints under each system are different too: under the first they are legal, controlled by authority, and with great reverence for what is orthodox; under the latter they are independent, speculative and rationalistic; so you can see that the seeds of ritualism and rationalism are in the soil where the gospel of free grace has been received, which the faithful servant has carefully and completely to seek

		Now the second class outside brethren, the Revivalists, is very marked and peculiar in itself.<a name=239:2></a> The preachers proclaim the gospel of free grace without works, in the clearest terms.<a name=239:3></a> They are generally indifferent about any church organisation, loose as to all church fellowship, and have revived with a true gospel in terms much of the old Methodistic excitement, only that baptism is often added as an evidence of sincerity in addition to expressions of feeling.<a name=239:4></a> Many have been converted under revival preaching, but not one so converted ever grows in the soil in which he was born, beyond a mere babe.<a name=239:5></a> God in His mercy transplants them into better soil, but then invariably they are the warmest and most earnest refusers of the soil and ministry in which they were born.<a name=239:6></a> The tendency of this, the revival ministry, little as they intend it themselves, and little as it might <i>prima facie</i> be expected, is to foster the flesh which is avowedly condemned as the source of the clerical system maintained by both churchman and dissenter.<a name=239:7></a> The revival preacher asserts that he is called to preach independently of any human organisation, and he repudiates the systems which limit the preacher to their appointment as carnal and of man; but while in leaving these in order to obtain liberty for himself, he asserts this right principle, yet when he acts, he practically denies it, for by his appeal to the natural feelings, and the use of exciting and persuasive words, he, while offering free grace to man as irretrievably lost, indirectly admits that there is some remnant of good in man, on which he can act by human means, and in this admission the flesh is spared, and all its components, and with the flesh, the world, which is man's work, also gets a place, so that with the revivalists neither the flesh nor the world are set aside and the church as Christ's body is never known.<a name=239:8></a> A revival preacher is ordinarily still in the world, and hence the ritualist and the rationalistic dissenter contrast themselves as to devotedness and ecclesiastical position with much plausible advantage with the revivalist.<a name=239:9></a> If I am right as to the above, and I surely think I am, and if even in measure you agree with me,

		THE BASIS FOR SERVICE

		Willingness to serve flows from a settled interest in Him whose service I undertake.<a name=262:8></a> I need to know Christ as the Amen, the One whose "Word endureth for ever".<a name=262:9></a> It declares fixity and endurance; a silent, positive, unalterable purpose -- the One who says, and it is done.<a name=262:10></a> Hence, if I know Christ to be the Amen, I know that whatever I do in His name and for Him, He is able to ratify and will ratify; my labour will not be in vain; and the consciousness of this does induce one to be "stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:58">1 Corinthians  15:58</a>).<a name=262:11></a> In fact, if I know not Christ to be the Amen, I have no sure foundation to rest on in my labours.<a name=262:12></a>
