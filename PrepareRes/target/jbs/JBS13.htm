		DISCIPLINE IN THE SCHOOL OF GOD: ITS NATURE AND EFFECT.

	<div class="paragraph">
		No subject can he more deeply interesting to the saint than the nature and effect of that discipline which our God, in the plenitude of His love and wisdom, administers to His people.<a name=1:1></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Interesting as the subject is, and one so necessary to the secret exercises of the soul, yet it is little understood; and the dealings of God are either counted strange, or wanting in any just or useful solution.<a name=1:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I propose, therefore, with the Lord's help, to present, in a series of papers, the peculiar discipline -- its object and its effect, detailed to us, respecting each distinguished witness for God on earth.<a name=1:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am induced to do this, in order to lead the minds of saints to study more a subject which of all others connects us most with the secret, loving thoughts of our God about us.<a name=1:4></a>

		I accordingly begin with Adam.<a name=1:5></a> Though not properly heading the life of faith, yet he was the subject of severe discipline, and a remarkable illustration of its effects.<a name=1:6></a> Adam at one time needed no discipline -- a state unknown to any since.<a name=1:7></a> When he fell, the day of discipline began.<a name=1:8></a> He who was made in the image of God, who approached nearer to God than any creature, even he, is now imbued with a spirit and a nature so adverse to God, that if he would live for God he must learn to renounce his own will, under the training of the mighty hand of God.<a name=1:9></a> To Adam this must have been a strange contrast to the once easy

		acquiescence of his mind with the will of God.<a name=2:1></a> Consequently he must have felt it the more; and as the rebellion of his heart was being subdued, he must have contrasted the rule of God with the powerlessness of innocence.<a name=2:2></a> As innocent, he fell; as fallen, the hand of God exalts him -- not ignorantly nor passively, but in all the activity of anxious conviction.<a name=2:3></a> Innocence with him was a weak thing; the power of God subduing his nature no longer innocent was a great and mighty thing.<a name=2:4></a> He never would have sought the innocent state again, for he knew how weak it was.<a name=2:5></a> He knew now that he was able to do more with the power of God in a fallen state, than in unassisted innocence he ever could aspire to.<a name=2:6></a> As innocent, he had no sense of the value of life; as fallen, yet believing in the revelation of God, he could now name the only creature he had yet named, <i>the mother of all living</i>.<a name=2:7></a> Under the sentence of death, he could speak of life, while as innocent, his penalty (if disobedient) was the loss of life.<a name=2:8></a> Innocence could have had no charm for him now.<a name=2:9></a> True, it was a moment of wondrous bliss; but it was a condition in which he could not stand; and under God's discipline, he stands <i>morally</i> higher, though <i>conditionally</i> lower.<a name=2:10></a> Adam was not deceived, but he was influenced.<a name=2:11></a> He early discovers the sensibilities of nature, which eventually led to his fall.<a name=2:12></a> Neither the world nor its glory, nor any class of the inferior creatures, can supply the craving of the sociable heart of Adam: for him there was not found an helpmeet, and it was "not good for him to be alone".<a name=2:13></a> The instincts of his nature were not satisfied; but when the one who satisfied them was deceived, he yields to her influence, as he himself admits: "She gave unto me, and I did eat".<a name=2:14></a> The first man disclosed this secret of his heart, that he was dependent on another; so that when Satan would not venture to beguile <i>him</i>, the object of his affections successfully influenced him.<a name=2:15></a> Now they have discovered themselves to be estranged from God, and they hide from His presence; but now it is that the first lessons of His grace are propounded to them.<a name=2:16></a>

		In discipline there is properly <i>conviction</i> of sin, as well as correction.<a name=3:1></a> Chastening or correction while there is suffering for sin is to make me a partaker of holiness.<a name=3:2></a> It is not to improve my nature, but so to convince me of its utter helplessness that I may be devoted unto God, which is the true and distinct meaning of sanctification, "without which no man shall see the Lord".<a name=3:3></a> There is exceeding pain in being convicted of sin: and if there be not a strong sense of the grace of God when we are convicted, there will be great depression, and a tendency to give up all in despair.<a name=3:4></a> Hence the exhortation, "Faint not when thou art <i>convicted</i> [Greek] of him".<a name=3:5></a> God does not convict hastily.<a name=3:6></a> He likes that, through the action of His word on our conscience, we may be the first to convict ourselves.<a name=3:7></a> It is very little use to tell a vain man of his faults; it generally only urges him the better to conceal or extenuate them.<a name=3:8></a> It is very difficult to induce a person in ill-health and unconvinced of it, to adopt the necessary regimen; the more you remonstrate with such a one, the more strenuously will he endeavour to prove you mistaken, and you exasperate the malady you would assuage, but the really sin-convicted soul, like the patient tremblingly alive to his danger, is ready to receive every true correction and remedy that is offered.<a name=3:9></a>

		When Adam had <i>perfected</i> the devices of his estranged and corrupted heart, when the aprons of fig-leaves are on and he hiding behind the trees, the voice of God searches him, although he seeks to escape from it.<a name=3:10></a> This is ever the tendency when light from the word first reaches us; we prepare to evade it, like the Pharisees leaving the presence of the Lord; and therefore we are continually allowed to run to the end of our own plans, in order to learn how futile they are.<a name=3:11></a> Many a weary hour and long day is squandered in the execution of plans which, when tested by the searching word of God, must be entirely abandoned.<a name=3:12></a> What is the nature of such plans?<a name=3:13></a> Are they to distance and conceal you from God, or are they to bring you nigh unto Him, and to unfold to Him the minutest secrets of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is important to study those two actions of the conscience; for they give rise to much exercise and trouble in the soul, from being confounded.<a name=5:4></a> When a man has satisfied his own conscience, has adopted some system which conceals from himself and from others the real state of his soul, he floats for a while on peaceful waters; but no sooner is the voice of the Lord heard, than all the elements seem to him involved in a mighty tornado.<a name=5:5></a> His sleep is broken; he is the convicted Peter of <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#5:8">Luke  5:8</a>: he is "afraid".<a name=5:6></a> The fact that he is naked and opened before God flashes fearfully before him, and so much the more because he had deceived himself, and his reputation with another had helped it on.<a name=5:7></a> The action of the Word of God would be desperate and overwhelming to the soul if we had not a "great High Priest passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God".<a name=5:8></a> He having been "tempted in all points like as we are, yet <i>without sin</i>", supports us with His sympathy as soon as we are, through the action of the word, <i>apart from the</i> SIN, and His atonement, in full effect before God, sets the convicted conscience at rest at the throne of grace, there to receive the grace and mercy it needs.<a name=5:9></a> This is just what Adam had to learn; consequently the voice pursues him to his hiding-place.<a name=5:10></a> It is in vain that we seek to escape the eye of God when He determines that it shall search us.<a name=5:11></a> If we "take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea", even there He will reach us!<a name=5:12></a> Oh, how the conscience that seeks escape from God overshadows itself within the foliage of this world!<a name=5:13></a> It engrosses itself with man's leading and most ambitious pursuits, but in vain.<a name=5:14></a> The "watchers" will cry aloud, "Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, and shake

		To each actor in this wondrous scene is now meted the judgment due to the part he has played in it.<a name=7:6></a> <i>Satan's</i> sentence is first pronounced, and while <i>his</i> doom is fixed, deliverance from his power and the eternal remedy of the gospel is declared to the listening and convicted Adam.<a name=7:7></a> It is the divine way, in restoring a soul, to establish it first in the power of God and in His grace.<a name=7:8></a> The draught of the fishes and the words of Jesus taught this to Peter; <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#5">Luke  5</a>.<a name=7:9></a> It is the groundwork for all godly recovery.<a name=7:10></a> When the heart is established, as David's was when Nathan said, "The Lord has taken away thy sin", then it can bear to hear what is the discipline necessary to correct that in it, which sin could act on.<a name=7:11></a> It is important to bear in mind the process by which the Lord reveals to the soul the discipline which He will impose.<a name=7:12></a> Whatever has provoked our failure is denounced, not in general terms, but in the proportion, and in the order too, of its guilt; and at the same time the true mode of deliverance is announced.<a name=7:13></a> Satan is not only sentenced, but the effect of his malice on man will be his own irremediable retribution.<a name=7:14></a> Man shall be avenged of his enemy.<a name=7:15></a> The serpent is not only assigned, as a signal judgment, to crawl and to eat dust, in perpetual hostility to the Seed of the woman, but his "violent dealing shall come down on his own pate": his head shall be bruised.<a name=7:16></a>

		Abel, as the first in faith on whom the penalty of sin was by birth entailed, must be one whose history we <i>may</i> expect to furnish us with outlines of that discipline, which a life eminent for faith would require.<a name=11:2></a> It is a mistake, and one which at times causes no little trial to the soul, to conclude, that because any line of truth or grace is strong in me, on that account nature is less assuming.<a name=11:3></a> The fact is the reverse; for the more nature is made to feel its fall, the more will it assume; and it is well to understand this.<a name=11:4></a> Had nature in its first estate been of any lower order than it was, although the fall could not have lowered it more than it has, yet its aspirations and assumption to escape from the effects of the fall would not have been so violent and daring as they are.<a name=11:5></a> The fact of man having been made in the image and likeness of God, gives nature ground for assuming what it has forfeited; and the more it is pressed to feel the immensity of the fall from its once high state, the more it struggles for recognition and assumes importance wherever it can.<a name=11:6></a> Hence it is that souls who are really in earnest to deny nature any position are opposed by it at every step, and thus learn practically that they alone who have suffered in the flesh have ceased from sin; that only the cross of Christ frees from the power and thraldom of nature and the world; and to this great moral truth learning death in discipline gives effect through God's grace.<a name=11:7></a> We learn that we are dead through the death of Christ, and that we are before God in Him, freed from all

		But to resume.<a name=24:6></a> The confusion of tongues being a fact, God now enters the scene and calls out from it a man -- even Abram -- to be the witness of faith and of dependence on Him, and to look, not for a "Babel", but "for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God".<a name=24:7></a> And we are graciously given the history of this witness and servant of God, in order to instruct us as to what our nature is in its action under the call of God, and how God deals with it under its many phases of self-will and independence; how He corrects, subdues and leads it into His own ways, which is for our blessing.<a name=24:8></a>

		Abram, then, failed at first in performing the second part of God's call; he did not leave his 'father's house;' and consequently is detained till his father is dead.<a name=26:6></a> This is the first stage in the life of faith, and though he entered on it readily and heartily, as it is written, "he went out, not knowing whither he went", he found that he could not perform it until death had severed the bond which still attached or connected him with nature, Faith is dependence on God, and independence of everything human to sustain it.<a name=26:7></a> The path proposed to Abram accordingly demanded the distinctest expression of dependence on God alone.<a name=26:8></a> It could not be without sacrifice, neither was it meant to be, and besides the exercises which his own heart must have passed through in treading this path of faith, he is taught that <i>death</i> must practically sever the tie which detains him on his way.<a name=26:9></a> The first stage is not traversed without the heart tasting of sorrow through death, but death which brings its own deliverance.<a name=26:10></a> If Abram had not been detained by his father, but had pursued the unknown path without halting till he reached the place to which God had called him, he would have escaped the sorrow which death entailed; but having allowed himself to be detained, nothing <i>could</i> relieve him but death; and therefore under that discipline he passes.<a name=26:11></a> Thus it is in mercy with many of us; our dependence on God is not simple and distinct; we halt in the path of faith, and are

		Death, then, having dissolved Abram's tie to nature and freed him from it, he must renew his course, disciplined, no doubt, by that which had removed the weight which impeded him: a discipline which he might have escaped had he walked in more energy of faith, but by which he was nevertheless a learner; and how wholesome the lesson -- that faith does not sway the natural desire in the recesses of the heart, that, though the blessings be great, if it submits to the dictation of God without exposure, yet it <i>rarely does</i>, and even if it does for awhile, will ever be contending for an open expression of itself; and, if openly acting, it must be openly subdued.<a name=27:2></a> If I allow my natural will to lead me, and thus turn me aside from the path of faith which is God's line, I must, when God in His mercy restores me to the right line, know in myself the setting aside of my will.<a name=27:3></a> This is self-mortification, and this is discipline.<a name=27:4></a>

		To young believers, to <i>all</i>, it is important how we undertake and accomplish this first stage of the life of faith: failure and vacillation here may entail sorrow and indecision throughout our course, for we never diverge from the path of faith without picking up "a thorn" from that nature which we are called to repudiate.<a name=27:5></a> It will be either nature mortified, or nature exhausted, or nature bereaved: and though we may be freed, as was Abram, by the death of his father, the failure though amended <i>may</i> not be eradicated in its effect, and if so, the discipline which it demanded must be continued.<a name=27:6></a> Lot went with Abram, but not only was he ever a trial to him personally, but his descendants were the greatest scourge to Abram's descendants; and their malignant enticements at the instigation of Balaam are set down in scripture as a type of the worst machinations against the church of God; <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2:13">Revelation  2:13</a>.<a name=27:7></a> Wherever we fail once, like a horse that stumbles, we are likely to fail again consequently there must be, through

		Abram now enters on the second stage of the life of faith -- a stranger in a strange land, depending on God, and he builds an altar; for the strangership into which faith leads us fixes our souls on God, and worship follows.<a name=28:2></a> But when the consequences or circumstances of our strangership occupy us, we lose the rest which faith supplies, and seek relief elsewhere.<a name=28:3></a> Thus Abram, when he found that there was a famine in the land, turned aside from the path of faith on which he had entered, and went down into Egypt.<a name=28:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How humbling it is to find how vacillating we are in that path, and however happily and firmly we seem to be walking in it, how needful to say "Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall"!<a name=28:5></a> Although Abram is graciously restored to the path from which he had departed, and even returns to the place where he had the altar at the beginning, we find that the thorns which he picked up in his wanderings pierce him in his restoration.<a name=28:6></a> The cattle, the gains of Egypt, provoke a collision between the herdsmen of Abram and Lot; but restoration always advances us in moral power, for true restoration sets us above that from which we, are restored; and now truly restored, he looks not to consequences, but, depending on God, maintains the path of faith in high moral power.<a name=28:7></a> My first difficulty in a walk of faith is to get clear of nature, place and kindred, and, being delivered therefrom, and in felt strangership, my next is the tendency to advance, or exalt myself, or to find rest in this new position, even as an emigrant in a wild and distant land seeks to make a home for himself as speedily as possible.<a name=28:8></a> This desire to advance, so strong a passion in the human soul, and the moving principle of all the great efforts of Babylon, may be designated ambition, but must be overcome by the man of faith, as God's witness in this evil world.<a name=28:9></a> Thus Abram's ambition is now tested; but discipline has done its work,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	<div class="paragraph">
		and his restoration is complete.<a name=29:1></a> Does he seek any acknowledgment or advancement in this new country?<a name=29:2></a> No!<a name=29:3></a> he is walking by faith, and resigns all present superiority to Lot, who, gratifying his ambition, chooses the well-watered plain, while Abram is blessed with a fuller revelation as a reward for his faith.<a name=29:4></a> But even this is not to be enjoyed without suffering, for the moment I am on the path with Christ, I am on the path of one sent of God to minister to us people down here; and Abram, the dependent man, pursuing his unseen and separate path, has now to come forward and render the very service which Christ fulfilled, and rescue his brother Lot, who, on the contrary, had gratified the ambition of his nature by mixing himself with the course of this world, and had been consequently embroiled in its sorrows.<a name=29:5></a> And if, in the dangers and exercises of this service, Abram was made to feel what he had to suffer from this natural tie which he had brought from Ur of the Chaldees, his soul was at the same time confirmed in the path of dependence on God, and as his faith had on the former occasion been rewarded by a fuller revelation of the promised inheritance, his conflict and service are now rewarded by the refreshment and blessing of Melchisedec in the name of the Lord God, possessor of <i>heaven</i> and <i>earth</i>, surely more than enough to compensate for the renouncement of the ambition of mere nature!<a name=29:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Here let me add, that though we separate from home and kindred, and still further take heavenly standing, yet if the tendencies of our nature be unsubdued, and we seek in any wise to distinguish or advance ourselves in our new position, we shall be as Lot while, on the other hand, though we may often need discipline and be taught to renew our course after failure, yet, if we really seek to maintain the path of <i>dependence</i> and separation, our faith will be strengthened by increased revelations, and our service will be invigorated by association, with Him who is our Forerunner within the veil, "even Jesus, an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec".<a name=29:7></a>

		We now enter on the third stage of Abram's history in the path of faith, and one in which he is brought under an entirely new line of instruction, even in the exercise of his affections.<a name=30:1></a> The ambition of his nature has been tested before; <i>now</i> his affections are to be put under discipline, and this is brought about in the first instance by the promise of a son, which is the subject of chapter 15.<a name=30:2></a> Let me say, in passing, that in tracing the history of this servant of God, I confine myself to the one subject, even discipline.<a name=30:3></a> I pass over many episodes on which others have dwelt largely, such as his communion with God, intercession, etc.<a name=30:4></a>, most interesting as it all is, but which has already been entered into fully.<a name=30:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It appears to me that the true state of Abram's heart is exposed in his reply to God's most gracious appeal to him in the commencement of this chapter.<a name=30:6></a> True, it was quite right for him to wish for a son; it was a wish responding to the counsels of God respecting him, and the lack of which would not have been according to the mind of God.<a name=30:7></a> But still his reply, "What wilt thou give me?<a name=30:8></a>" does not rise to the elevation in which God sought to establish him, even in perfect contentment and satisfaction with <i>Himself</i>, for what could He "<i>give</i>" him greater than the assurance of being Himself his "exceeding great reward"?<a name=30:9></a> Nevertheless, God in His grace meets him on his own level and <i>promises</i> that which He had before counselled to give; but a long course of discipline lies between him and the fulfilment of the promise, and as Abraham must learn in his own home a preparation for that trial to his affections which awaited him so many years afterwards, and which it was necessary for him to pass through in order to perfect him in the life of faith.<a name=30:10></a> It was not at all that he undervalued the fulness and nearness in which God had revealed Himself to him, but he disclosed the secret feebleness of the human soul to rest in God apart from any <i>human link</i>.<a name=30:11></a> God knows this, and offers graciously to supply it; but if He promises and gives Isaac, Abraham must hold him from God.<a name=30:12></a>

		Abraham believed God, but his heart needed preparation and discipline, as we see by the impatience of nature which he evinces while waiting for the fulfilment of the promise, and this he is subjected to in his own private circle.<a name=31:1></a> Perhaps there is no greater cause of delay to the accomplishment of what God purposes to confer on us than the natural mind (if I may say so) getting a hint of it; for as it is a point with Satan to spoil what he cannot defeat, so is it with the wilfulness of our nature which would fain adopt and accomplish what originated entirely outside itself and with God; just as Eve, interpreting a spiritual truth by a natural mind, takes Cain for the promised seed.<a name=31:2></a> It does not and cannot enter the heart of man the extent and nature of what God prepares for them that love Him.<a name=31:3></a> An Ishmael was Abraham's measure, an Isaac was God's, In the meantime Abraham must learn, through contention, strife and sorrow, what is the fruit of his impatience, and in the end he must do what was very "grievous in his sight", even to banish his son.<a name=31:4></a> Thus our inventions do but postpone our real blessings, for it is necessary that we should see the end of them.<a name=31:5></a> It must have been a period of nearly twenty years from the time of the promise to the birth of Isaac, and many were the exercises he had to pass through during that time, as well as many and great communications made to him by the Lord.<a name=31:6></a>

		JACOB
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The history of Jacob is peculiarly interesting to us, for in it are developed the activities of the natural will, not so much in the contravention of the expressed counsel of God, but rather in an attempt to secure by his own instrumentality what was pre-ordained of God.<a name=42:7></a> The more intelligent the mind of man is and impressed with the purpose of God, the more does it need subjection to God; for otherwise it will seek to accomplish, by natural means, what ought to be left to the ordering of God; and this produces restlessness.<a name=42:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The mind, thus active, has great need for self-judgment; for its error is not refusing or misapprehending the will of God, but in attempting to promote and secure it by its own efforts.<a name=42:9></a> Now, when this is the case, the Lord allows His servant to find, by sorrowful experience, the fruit of his own plans.<a name=42:10></a> And though the purposes of His love remain the same, they must be reached in circumstances which declare that He who blesses, and addeth no sorrow to it, has had to deal with the will of the one whom He blesses.<a name=42:11></a> "The fear of the Lord is wisdom, and the knowledge of the holy is understanding".<a name=42:12></a> If I have not God before me, I never can, with a natural mind and in a world of evil, walk wisely: for God is the fountain of wisdom.<a name=42:13></a>

		Therefore mere knowledge in itself is nothing; that is, it never leads a man to walk with God.<a name=43:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Faith comes before knowledge: there is no link to God in knowledge if faith does not precede it.<a name=43:2></a> If I am depending on God, all true knowledge must increase that dependence; for, if I learn correctly, I find that there is none so worthy of dependence as He.<a name=43:3></a> If I love God, I know Him, but my love feeds my knowledge: otherwise "knowledge puffeth up".<a name=43:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Jacob is a remarkable example of one appreciating blessing, but ever and anon intercepting and anticipating the ways of God by his own plans.<a name=43:5></a> The heart was right, we might say; but the mind was unsubdued, and the natural mind cannot act but according to its own perversity.<a name=43:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus in the first act of his life presented to us, he evinces a greater regard for the blessing, and the position which the birthright would confer, than for the means by which he should secure them.<a name=43:7></a> He takes the advantage of his brother's destitution to seize the valued, the justly valued, prize, which Esau ought not to have surrendered for any gain.<a name=43:8></a> Yet the possession of the birthright failed to give Jacob that assurance of the blessing which it represented: for if it had, he would not afterwards have so readily complied with his mother's unworthy expedient to secure it for him.<a name=43:9></a> And why?<a name=43:10></a> The desired mercy had been grasped by him in a natural way; and he derived none of the satisfaction from it which he would have experienced had it reached him in a divine way; for a divine way always connects the soul with God.<a name=43:11></a> If a mercy is not connected with God it may often make me more miserable; but if it is, if I know that it flows from His love, my heart receives it in tranquillity and confidence; for I know that though I may lose the proof of His love, I cannot lose the love itself, and that the love cannot exist without declaring itself.<a name=43:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The dream at Bethel was the divine communication of the blessing; but not until Jacob is made to feel the bitter fruits of his own wilfulness, during a period of twenty years in Padan-aram, is he brought into that closeness of exercise with the Lord, which, though successful, results in personal disparagement.<a name=44:8></a> No one is restored to God after a course of wilfulness but must know in himself that the success of God's grace stands out in contrast to his nature by which he had been led and deceived, and as the grace obtains its place and value, the nature must be proportionately condemned and abhorred.<a name=44:9></a>

		JOSEPH
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The history of Joseph unfolds to us the trials and duties of a servant of God.<a name=52:9></a> The evils and failure of human nature are not brought before us in his course, as in that of some we have already studied.<a name=52:10></a> Joseph is regarded primarily as a servant and instrument for God's work; and consequently we have to trace the exercises and purgation to which he must be subjected in order to fit him for that work.<a name=52:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first notice we have of him is respecting his position in his father's house.<a name=52:12></a> "Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age; and he made him a coat of many colours".<a name=52:13></a> Thus loved and signalised by his father, his heart was enlarged.<a name=52:14></a> Tasting the sweetness of affection, his own was drawn out; for nothing generates affection in us so much as the assurance of its existence for us; as it is written, "We love him, because he first loved us".<a name=52:15></a> When love asserts its claim, every other claim is acknowledged and valued as only

	<div class="paragraph">
		opportunities for its expression.<a name=53:1></a> So Joseph's heart, in tender age, expanded in the genial atmosphere of his father's love; but this, at the same time, exposed him to the envy of those who had proved themselves unworthy of it.<a name=53:2></a> "His brethren hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him".<a name=53:3></a> While, on the one side, he learned the tenderness and resources of his father's affection, on the other, he suffered reproach and persecution for being so favoured.<a name=53:4></a> If the one attracted him to his father, the other painfully warned him that he must be dependent on his affection, for outside of it, and on account of it, he was a sufferer.<a name=53:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, early in life and in the domestic circle, did Joseph learn (as indeed do all God's Servants) the elementary principles of that truth which must sustain him in the highest services by-and-by; even that as the loved of <i>God</i> he is the hated of man.<a name=53:6></a> The love of his father, conspicuously indicated by the coat of many colours, must compensate him for the hatred of the brethren; must nerve and prepare him for all their opposition and envy.<a name=53:7></a> This is the first and greatest lesson which the servant of God has to learn on entering his course, and that which Christ (of whom Joseph is the type) so fully and perfectly apprehended: He who, ever dwelling in the full consciousness of the Father's love, was thereby enabled to meet unmoved all the hatred and malice of man.<a name=53:8></a> And still further, the one who knows best the Father's love must be the best exponent of that love -- the best qualified servant for the Father to send on a mission of interest to those who were ignorant of it.<a name=53:9></a> "The only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him".<a name=53:10></a> Joseph, still bearing out his character of type and servant, is deputed by his father to see how his brethren fared; but before this event there are two intimations given him of the position which he must occupy by-and-by with respect to these communications.<a name=53:11></a> He receives no support from his father, who rebukes him, and this with the concomitant and increased opposition of his brethren, laid the groundwork of that

		How little we notice or value the small circumstances of our early life, and the large effect they exercise on us!<a name=54:3></a> From infancy we are forming for the place destined for us of God; and our whole history is but a succession of processes preparing us for the end, the very first of them, in all material points, bearing strict analogy to the one which closes our course.<a name=54:4></a> Thus was it with David.<a name=54:5></a> The first notice we have of him is feeding sheep in the wilderness, from whence he was taken, after an intervening process of discipline, "to feed Israel his people, and Jacob his inheritance", a position which he held, in many a varying circle, to the end.<a name=54:6></a> So also with Moses.<a name=54:7></a> Alone for God, with God, and under God, in the ark of bulrushes, every era of his life is of the same order, whether in Midian, in the mount, or on Pisgah at last.<a name=54:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Joseph then starts on his mission, assured of his father's love, aware of the hatred of his brethren, and secretly impressed with an unknown, and as yet incomprehensible, idea of future greatness.<a name=54:9></a> Responding to the will of his father, he did not shrink from the post of danger, which his father did not apprehend for him.<a name=54:10></a> If the One greater than we are, in love and in wisdom, appoint us a path of service, which would be grateful to Himself, and He, knowing all, apprehends no danger for us, we may surely enter on it in simple confidence.<a name=54:11></a> It is the only true and happy spirit for any path of service.<a name=54:12></a> Emerging from the private home -- known expression of our Father's love -- to launch into the tumultuous ocean of unreasonable and unloving brethren, and be messengers of the Father's interest respecting them.<a name=54:13></a> Thus Christ came, and thus must every true servant of His be sustained and useful.<a name=54:14></a>

		Joseph, pursuing this path of service, bearer of his father's message and exponent of his father's interest, came to Shechem, but is checked in the execution of his mission by finding his brethren not there.<a name=55:1></a> Such checks often occur in order to test our reality as to whether the Father's will is wholly our desire.<a name=55:2></a> Joseph's heart was evidently set on its accomplishment, for, instead of returning when he could not find them, he lingers at his post until he gets tidings of them, and then follows them to Dothan, unprepared for the murderous and malicious reception which awaited him.<a name=55:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		After various modifications of these evil purposes (for wicked counsels must always be <i>multifarious</i>, whereas there is but <i>one</i> way for doing right), Joseph is sold to the Ishmaelites, and again sold by them into Egypt, unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, and captain of the guard.<a name=55:4></a> What a change for him, from the glow of a parent's love, uppermost and chief, to be first murderously assailed by his own brethren, and now a bondsman in Egypt!<a name=55:5></a> Had the divine communications vouchsafed to him in his dreams made him independent of everything from man (be it love or hatred), and dependent only on God?<a name=55:6></a> If they had, he needed it at this juncture; and, undoubtedly, that was the value of the discipline he was now undergoing.<a name=55:7></a> Truth is communicated to us first, and we may greatly value the acquisition of it; but the winter can alone season the succulent growths of spring and summer.<a name=55:8></a> The great reality of the truth must be learned by us; Joseph must be cast on God.<a name=55:9></a>

		Job is at first presented to us as a pattern man, happy in his own condition, faithful and true in his relations toward God.<a name=59:10></a> We see in him a man who had on every side risen above the evil and sorrow which is the lot of man; a remarkable instance and exemplar among men of how God

		could distinguish from the rest of men -- one who walked before Him in integrity; he was for God on earth, and he was blessed abundantly by God.<a name=60:1></a> He was perfect and upright, one that feared God and eschewed evil, and as to possessions and earthly things, they were so abundant that this man was the greatest of all the men of the East.<a name=60:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is important to see that Job was walking on the earth well-pleasing to God, and owned by Him as such, when Satan first called in question his fidelity, and imputed to him the unworthy motive which was couched in the question, "Doth Job serve God for nought?<a name=60:3></a>" It affords us the clue to a true apprehension of the nature of the discipline to which he was subjected, when we see that it was not primarily on account of personal failure, but the rather for the purpose of exemplifying to Satan the truth of God's estimate of His servant.<a name=60:4></a> It will be seen that much personal failure was betrayed by Job while under the divine discipline; for though the trials which he suffered were inflicted by Satan, and with the intent to verify his calumny on him, yet they were used of God to accomplish in Job that self-renunciation and faith in God which did eventually enable God to establish in full blessedness the truth of the estimate which He had, in His goodness, given of His servant.<a name=60:5></a> It is wonderful and most interesting to trace the way and manner in which the blessed God at once confounds Satan, vindicates His own judgment and educates His servant up to the full understanding of Himself, and having brought him to it, rebukes Satan by bestowing on Job twice as much as he had before.<a name=60:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We must seek to realise in our minds what it must have been for one in the circumstances in which Job was to be suddenly plunged into such reverses.<a name=60:7></a> We see him but a moment before enjoying the full circle of God's mercies, and at the same time maintaining a scrupulous conscientiousness with God; in the jealousy of his zeal rising up early in the morning, after the feasting of his sons, to offer up burnt-offerings according to the number of them all; for Job said, "It may be my sons have sinned, and cursed

		God in their hearts; and this he did continually".<a name=61:1></a> When every known point of the circle was thus carefully and with jealousy of heart toward God watched over, we might have expected, and doubtless Job had reckoned that there would have been no disturbance of the rest in which, through mercy, he was set.<a name=61:2></a> Doubtless, whatever might be the fears which, like clouds coursing the sky on the brightest day, beset him, he had no idea of the malignant spirit who, by aspersing him before God, only moves the blessed God to surrender him into Satan's hands, in order that He might, in the most unequivocal manner, prove his integrity and unshaken fidelity to Himself.<a name=61:3></a> We must also bear in mind that, while it is God's purpose, in His dealings with Job, to vindicate His own estimate of His servant, it is, at the same time, shewn us how He educates or disciplines that servant so as to render him worthy of this estimate.<a name=61:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was at a moment when Job could little have expected it that the crash came.<a name=61:5></a> No doubt he often had his fears, for he says, "That which I feared greatly has come upon me;" and this must ever be the case when the soul has no better security for the love than the evidence and presence of its gifts.<a name=61:6></a> The gifts are thus a snare to us, and Satan's imputation against us is often in a measure true; our ground for rest and quietness of spirit before God being His kindness and mercies to us, and not simply the knowledge of His love.<a name=61:7></a> This is very evident, from the violent grief and despair many of His people fall into when they are deprived of any particular mercy.<a name=61:8></a> They had rested in the gift more than in God, and the gift was to them the evidence of His love; the love itself was not the rest of their heart.<a name=61:9></a> Satan knows man's tendency, and therefore hesitates not to accuse Job of it, asserting that he had no link with God, or reverence for Him, but on account of His abundant mercies to him.<a name=61:10></a> God, in His grace, had challenged Satan as to His servant, that there was none like him in all the earth.<a name=61:11></a> Satan retorts, imputing to Job a sordid motive for his allegiance, and asserting that if he were deprived of all which now attached him to

		In one day, in quick succession, Job loses property, children, everything.<a name=62:3></a> Never was a catastrophe so rapid and so complete.<a name=62:4></a> "Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped".<a name=62:5></a> He bears these first great waves of adversity in a most exemplary manner, and says, "Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord".<a name=62:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is to be noted that a great accumulation of afflictions are better borne at first than afterwards.<a name=62:7></a> The strength that is in the heart, the confidence in God, is the resource where the crash is sudden and terrific; and in the rapidity with which Satan used his power, it appears to me he outwitted himself, for certainly sufferings with an interval between them are more trying.<a name=62:8></a> Satan, however, hoped that the crash would be so overwhelming that Job could not but reproach God for the calamity.<a name=62:9></a> But extreme difficulty always calls out the latent strength, as with a drowning man, where a lesser difficulty would not.<a name=62:10></a> The trial is not sufficient at times to rouse one to effort.<a name=62:11></a> It is when the effort has been drawn out by extreme difficulty and has proved unavailing that real helplessness is felt, and the cloud of despair invests the soul.<a name=62:12></a> Job had borne his troubles so well that the gracious God is able again to challenge Satan as to His estimate of His servant.<a name=62:13></a> Satan retorts, "Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.<a name=62:14></a> But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face".<a name=62:15></a> Of course it fills the cup of misery, if besides being deprived of everything my heart clings to, and the whole scene once so lovely and pleasing to me is now a waste -- with but tombs of my former enjoyments, if besides this I have become by bodily affliction a burden to myself!<a name=62:16></a>

		Surely bodily suffering and disease would in such a case be the bitterest way of reminding me of my utter desolation without heart or power to retrieve my condition.<a name=63:1></a> God permits Satan to afflict Job with the most grievous bodily suffering: he is smitten with sore boils from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot.<a name=63:2></a> How complete his misery!<a name=63:3></a> his wife is overwhelmed, and in her distress falls into Satan's snare, and counsels her husband to curse God and die.<a name=63:4></a> Thus everything is against Job.<a name=63:5></a> What a moment of exercise to his soul!<a name=63:6></a> How he must have wrought within himself as to hope in God!<a name=63:7></a> But every exercise, though the sufferer at the time little knows it, is strengthening the soul in God.<a name=63:8></a> The deeper the distress, the deeper the sense of His grace in relieving it; the one only makes a good rooting ground for the other.<a name=63:9></a>

		The first thought, and the most bitter one, after awaking to a full sense of one's misery, is to curse one's day; a terrible impression, and the one which leads to suicide when God is not known.<a name=64:9></a> But when God is known, as in Job's case, it is the beginning of healthy action, not in the discontent and wretchedness which it discloses, but because the sense of death, utter exclusion from everything, is known and felt.<a name=64:10></a> I may give way to rebellion and discontent in learning the utter wretchedness of man on earth, but the sense of this is necessary to full self-renunciation.<a name=64:11></a> I ought not to blame God for it, but I need to realise it as man's true place.<a name=64:12></a> Death, because of such present misery, is preferred.<a name=64:13></a> To live in it has no attraction for the heart.<a name=64:14></a> This Job feels.<a name=64:15></a> He knows not that God seeks to make him a witness of dependence on Himself against Satan.<a name=64:16></a> But this is God's way.<a name=64:17></a> Discipline may have the effect of making us feel that death is preferable to life, but it is working out God's purposes.<a name=64:18></a>

		a consequence, I turn back on my own history and become occupied with myself.<a name=71:1></a> Thus Job in chapter 29 dwells on the past, and this is always an evidence of the soul not being right with God; for if it were going on with Him it would have greater things than the past to recount.<a name=71:2></a> This is especially the case when what it has to recall is self -- amiability and God's gifts and goodness, which made up the sum of the young ruler's possessions; <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#10">Mark  10</a>.<a name=71:3></a> If I have a sense of sin from having been a transgressor, then retrospection is necessarily shorn of its charms; but when in misery the soul can recall a time of uninterrupted blamelessness of life and conduct -- the light of God's favour in His gifts shed around it -- such a retrospect is attractive and engrossing to the heart.<a name=71:4></a> Job's time was before the land of Canaan was given, and hence, as a Gentile, he is learning the evil of himself, not by law but in the presence of God, and having lived if in all good conscience, he found it no easy matter to count all as dung and dross.<a name=71:5></a> He is allowed to dwell on it in order to shew us how the righteousness which is of ourselves may engage and hinder us, and yet, on the other hand, how utterly futile was the course of Job's friends adopted to help him to a true estimate of himself before God, and according to God Himself.<a name=71:6></a> Thus, still occupied with himself, Job in chapter 29 dwells on his former prosperity, while in chapter 31 he goes <i>seriatim</i>, over the goodness of his whole course and ways, judging according to man's judgment, and after it all he sums up thus: "My desire is, that the Almighty would answer me".<a name=71:7></a> Such are the exercises of a soul which, without having done anything to offend the natural conscience, has not seen itself in the light of God's presence, and therefore knows not the corruption of its nature.<a name=71:8></a> If the natural conscience could have found wherewithal to convict, its action might have been easy and summary; but where the <i>moral</i> sense is not offended, a lengthened process is required for the soul ere it can reach a <i>spiritual</i> sense -- that is, an estimate of itself formed in the light of God's presence.<a name=71:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 35 Elihu touches on a new point, namely, that God is infinitely above man; that man's works can in no wise affect Him.<a name=74:4></a> Job must learn that "If thou be righteous, what givest thou him?<a name=74:5></a> or what receiveth he of thine hand?<a name=74:6></a>" "If Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but <i>not before God</i>".<a name=74:7></a> There ought to be perception of the goodness that cometh from God; but on the contrary, "none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night?<a name=74:8></a>" -- when all around is darkness.<a name=74:9></a> Job had dwelt on what he was to God, not on what God was to him.<a name=74:10></a> And then, "Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it".<a name=74:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 36 another point is pressed on Job, even that if he looks at things from God's side, he must see His righteousness.<a name=74:12></a> Job ought to understand that "He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous" -- "He openeth also their ear to discipline" -- "He delivereth the poor in his affliction".<a name=74:13></a> Here it was that Job had failed; he had been occupied in justifying himself, instead of having his ear opened to discipline.<a name=74:14></a> "Behold, God is great".<a name=74:15></a> There is an immense advance in the soul when it comes to this, and regards things distinctly as from God's side.<a name=74:16></a> When I have a true sense of what He is, the effect must be to humble myself under His mighty hand, and to wait on Him.<a name=74:17></a>

		The next incident recorded in Moses' history (chapter 18) brings him before us in a lower point of view.<a name=93:8></a> He is influenced and in a measure perverted by man.<a name=93:9></a> He had reached great eminence in service; he had just erected an altar in record of what God had been to him in his conflict with hostile man: but now he has to encounter the voice of nature in the well intentioned but pernicious advice of his father-in-law, and yielding to it he morally sinks.<a name=93:10></a> In converse with Jethro, he seems to forget the lesson just taught him by the conflict with Amalek, and surrenders the service to which he was called, or part of it, without any counsel or even sanction from God.<a name=93:11></a> The assistance which he sought here from the heads of the people was of a very different order to that which he rightly accepted from Aaron or Hur in the conflict with Amalek.<a name=93:12></a> The latter was a help to himself personally, whereas the former was a transference of the duties imposed by the Lord on himself to others.<a name=93:13></a> Jethro had heard of all that the Lord had done for Moses and for Israel, and he comes to re-engage Moses with his wife and children, whom it appears he had sent back.<a name=93:14></a> Jethro, I think, here morally represents the association amongst men which a servant of God may be enticed into by relationship; and which, while owning in common with him the work of the Lord, assumes an undue importance, for it was an assumption for an uncircumcised Gentile to arrogate to himself leadership of the people of God by inducing Moses and Aaron and the elders of Israel to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, however, at the mount of God, Moses is to enter on a new office, and fulfil a different mission (chapter 19).<a name=94:8></a> Up to this he had been a deliverer and a ruler; now he is to be a lawgiver and a prophet -- one who, as revealing the mind of God to the people, is thus, in a sense, a mediator between God and them.<a name=94:9></a> Moses, as a highly favoured servant, must be instructed in this blessed line.<a name=94:10></a> God had met His people in their need, and delivered them, but as yet, like many a delivered one, they do not apprehend the nature of God.<a name=94:11></a> The pressure of impending ruin had been removed, but they have yet to learn God, and how utterly ruined they are in His sight; and Moses, instructed of God, is now to instruct them in this.<a name=94:12></a>

		He is, therefore, called up into the mount, and brought into a nearness to the Lord, and receives a revelation of Him, different from what he had previously received in the burning bush.<a name=94:13></a> <i>There</i> it was all grace, though "holy ground" the aspect of the Lord was one of grace and compassion; here, it is God's terrible majesty, the claim of a holy God on man, and the greatness of His distance from man.<a name=94:14></a> Both these lessons were necessary for Moses in order to fit him for the place assigned him, towards the people of God; and it is always the manner of God's discipline to make His servants practically pass through, and learn in a fuller, and more vivid way, that particular line of truth of

	<div class="paragraph">
		Having pronounced the law, and in type and figure sprinkled the blood of purgation, he is called (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#24">Exodus  24</a>) to receive not only the law, engraven on stones, but also a much fuller revelation of God's interest for His people; the provision of grace based on the Lord's foreknowledge of their inability to keep the law, In these interesting scenes, it is not the subject of them which must engage us here, but the blessed way in which Moses is prepared and qualified for the fulfilment of the task entrusted to him.<a name=95:5></a> He is called up into the mount, on which the glory of God rested.<a name=95:6></a> Six days the cloud covered the mount, and on the seventh day God called to Moses out of the midst of that glory, which was, like a devouring fire in the eyes of the children of Israel: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.<a name=95:7></a> A fit preparation, truly, for one who is to be commissioned to set forth on earth a pattern of the things which he saw.<a name=95:8></a> Thoroughly detached from earth, and enwrapped in the cloud which surrounded the glory of God, his soul was impressed with the wondrous subject and detail of His commission.<a name=95:9></a> Then it was that the Lord said unto him, "Let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them, according to all that I shew thee".<a name=95:10></a> Thus we have an insight into God's manner of educating His servant for His own purposes; and let us here especially note two things: first, that Moses is near God while learning the truth, and knows in himself the effect of being

	<div class="paragraph">
		But before Moses has entered on this new mission, the people of Israel have fallen into idolatry and made a calf, and he is summoned from his exalted position in the mount to witness the departure of the people from the covenant just made; and here he gives expression to sentiments which testify to us how deeply he had learnt to care for the glory of God.<a name=96:2></a> In this point of view (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#32:11">Exodus  32:11</a> - 13) it is an utterance hardly equalled in the whole of scripture; but the previous forty days and forty nights enabled him thus to appreciate it, and every step he takes in this trying moment declares how fully he had entered into the mind of God.<a name=96:3></a> He breaks the tables of the covenant, for they had already been broken on man's side, and this is no time to publish them.<a name=96:4></a> Then he took the idol which they had made and burnt it with fire, and ground it to powder, and strewed it on the water, and made the people drink of it.<a name=96:5></a> Their sin must not only be put away, but they must taste in themselves the reality of it.<a name=96:6></a> Then he insists on separation from evil, and requires every one who is on the Lord's side to slay the recreants.<a name=96:7></a> In a day of universal failure, the witnesses of repentance and returning allegiance cannot too strongly enunciate their severance from their former associations, annihilating every trace of them, even unto death, and Moses, the well-prepared servant, leads the way in this.<a name=96:8></a>

		Thus having, so to speak, prepared them for God, as repentant and separate, he returns to God to intercede for them.<a name=96:9></a> The Lord refuses to go up with them, and desires them to strip themselves of their ornaments, that He may know what to do with them, (chapter 33).<a name=96:10></a> In this moment of great suspense, while the people are waiting under the hand of God, Moses, instructed in the holiness of the mind of God, knows what to do with the people, and how to restore relations.<a name=96:11></a> He pitches the tabernacle <i>afar off</i> from the guilty camp, in order that every one who, humbled under

		We have now followed Moses in his ascent to the highest point which was ever accorded to <i>man</i>.<a name=97:10></a> To the Apostle Paul, a <i>man in Christ</i>, greater, fuller and more peculiar glories were revealed, but "there arose not a prophet in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face".<a name=97:11></a> Paul (though unconscious of being in the body) must needs have a thorn in the flesh, lest he should be puffed up.<a name=97:12></a> We need not, therefore, be surprised to find Moses ere long demonstrating that he is not able, by reason of his infirmity, to maintain the great position assigned him.<a name=97:13></a>

		We now come (chapter 20) to the last scene which we shall notice in the history of Moses, and that is, his forfeiture of his right to enter Canaan, because he failed to sanctify the Lord in the eyes of the people.<a name=99:2></a> This occurred in the thirty-ninth year of their wanderings, just as he was about to see the happy termination of all his labours, and the fulfilment of God's promises.<a name=99:3></a> He seems to have failed in those very points in which he has appeared most eminent.<a name=99:4></a> He speaks "unadvisedly with his lips", and fails to sanctify the Lord in the eyes of the people (that Lord whose glory was so dear to his heart), and thus disqualifies himself from planting the people in the land of their inheritance, when on its very borders.<a name=99:5></a> When the congregation murmured for water, God tells him, "Take the rod, and gather the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and <i>speak</i> ye unto the rock before their eyes, and it shall give forth his water".<a name=99:6></a> But instead of this, Moses, carried away by his irritation, first upbraids the people, and says, "Must WE fetch you water out of this rock?<a name=99:7></a>" and then lifts up his hand and <i>smites the rock twice</i>.<a name=99:8></a> The Lord was now acting through the priesthood in grace towards the people.<a name=99:9></a> The rock was not to be smitten again.<a name=99:10></a> Moses is not at this moment in fellowship with the mind and ways of the Lord -- he has failed in his mission and he must forfeit his leadership.<a name=99:11></a> Such is the manner of God's discipline!<a name=99:12></a> No amount of faithful service will mitigate or divert the penalty of assumption in that service.<a name=99:13></a> Paul, contrary to the warning of the Spirit, would go to Jerusalem, and a prison was his penalty for many a day afterwards.<a name=99:14></a>

		His first failure bears a close analogy to his last.<a name=100:3></a> But though thus chastened as to his service and mission, he loses nothing of his personal nearness to the Lord, and indeed gains in this way, for the Lord Himself shews him the land.<a name=100:4></a> So was it with Paul.<a name=100:5></a> While suffering the penalty of his failure in prison, he found more than ever that Christ was everything to him, and more than service; and no doubt Moses on Pisgah must have felt that God was greater to him than even the promised land, or than leadership thereto.<a name=100:6></a> At any rate, his submission to the Lord's will is very beautiful (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#27:12">Numbers  27:12</a> - 23), and his ungrudging transference of his own dignity and office to Joshua bespeaks how truly self-crucified he is.<a name=100:7></a> While his eye feeds on the inheritance, he is suffering crucifixion in the flesh.<a name=100:8></a> He lays himself down in death, but the Lord takes care of his body; Satan contends for it in vain; <a href="../bible/Jude.htm#9">Jude  9</a>.<a name=100:9></a> Soon it will be raised a glorious body like His own glorious body, according to the power which He has to subdue all things to Himself.<a name=100:10></a>

		To recapitulate, I would call attention to the four great periods of discipline in Moses' history.<a name=100:11></a> The first: forty years' exile in the desert of Midian, because he had attempted to carry out in his own strength and in his own way the purpose of grace in his soul.<a name=100:12></a> Surely there is no more constant failure in many a young and earnest servant of Christ; he is manifestly so unsuccessful and disheartened that he is driven into seclusion and solitude with God and with his own heart, until he has learned not to trust in himself, and this period ends when.<a name=100:13></a> his soul is assured by signs and revelations of the power of God.<a name=100:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The second is a still darker and more terrible moment,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=101>[Page 101]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		when the Lord met him and sought to kill him because he had not circumcised his son.<a name=101:1></a> Here it is not that he is a wanderer in the desert learning how powerless he is as a man, and learning that all power is in God, but the Lord is against him, because of his thoughtlessness in connecting as the Lord's servant what is uncircumcised with the Lord; and here the Lord seeks to kill him -- to take away the life which Moses had not condemned in his son by circumcision.<a name=101:2></a> The old man must be crucified, and hence we are circumcised, in putting off the body of sin, by the circumcision of Christ.<a name=101:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The third time of discipline is when he is introduced into the glory of God for forty days and forty nights.<a name=101:4></a> It is not now God seeking to kill him, as a man on earth; but in the glory, placing him above and outside of everything human, and hence so instructing him in all His ways and desires that he can construct a likeness on earth to the true thing -- heaven itself.<a name=101:5></a> (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#25">Exodus  25</a>; <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#8:5">Hebrews  8:5</a>.<a name=101:6></a>)

	<div class="paragraph">
		The fourth period is when on Mount Pisgah he must really; enter into death, because of the unadvised expression of his lips in the most sacred service for God.<a name=101:7></a> Death there must be; but at the same time his eye fully and distinctly surveys the inheritance which God has secured for His people.<a name=101:8></a> Amen.<a name=101:9></a>

		So it is with Joshua.<a name=102:1></a> Type, as well as servant, of Christ, he is presented to us at the outset as a warrior chief, prepared to encounter the adversaries of Israel, and is thus typical of the Captain of our salvation; <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:10">Hebrews  2:10</a>.<a name=102:2></a> Joshua's first recorded engagement is with Amalek, who represents to us the flesh, or the natural man, in active opposition to the progress of the people of God.<a name=102:3></a> Egypt is more properly the world; Amalek, the flesh personated; Assyria, nature in its attractions and influences.<a name=102:4></a> The conflict with Amalek was the beginning of warfare to Israel, and Joshua for the first time characteristically appears on the scene as leader.<a name=102:5></a> He discomfits the enemy by the edge of the sword; but, while thus victorious, he is made to know <i>on what</i> his success depends.<a name=102:6></a> He learns to lead the people to victory by being himself subject to the vicissitudes of conflict while depending on an unseen agency for success.<a name=102:7></a> Moses stands on the top of the hill with the rod of God in his hand.<a name=102:8></a> Success wanes whenever his hands droop, and in the very alternations of the conflict Joshua learns to depend on God, and succeeds because he depends.<a name=102:9></a> This illustrates to us in a very striking way the true manner of conflict.<a name=102:10></a> It exemplifies practically that word, "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.<a name=102:11></a> For it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure", <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:12">Philippians  2:12</a>.<a name=102:12></a>

		But Joshua, like many of ourselves, had to learn an important lesson in this stage of his history.<a name=109:5></a> It was this -- that no amount of previous acquisition or enjoyment can secure us against defeat and overthrow, if in spirit we have connived at or become associated with principles or practices contrary to God.<a name=109:6></a> In ignorance of the cause he prays, mourns, and even remonstrates with the Lord.<a name=109:7></a> His faith wavers in the intensity of his distress.<a name=109:8></a> But it appears from the Lord's rebuke to him that he lacked spiritual wisdom in so doing, for such would have concluded, from a previous knowledge of God, that He would not have permitted defeat to have overtaken His people had there not been some grievous departure from Him.<a name=109:9></a> He ought thus to have searched for the concealed evil, instead of up-braiding the Lord.<a name=109:10></a> Prayer will never compensate for neglected action; it leads <i>to</i> action -- seeks light and strength <i>for</i> action, but if I use not the light I already possess, no amount of prayer will obtain more for me, for if I believe not the revelation which I have received, I am not prepared to receive more.<a name=109:11></a>

		Joshua, having passed through this great exercise and its results, is now taught how he is to succeed against Ai.<a name=111:8></a> It must not be in an open and distinguished way, as at Jericho, for failure entails consequences even after the breach is healed.<a name=111:9></a> The conquest, however, is no less effective, and faith can discern the same amount of spiritual power, although the army is less distinguished.<a name=111:10></a> But Joshua has yet more to learn, and chapter 9 unfolds another order of trial, and one brought on, too, by a temporary lack of dependence on God on his part and that of the princes.<a name=111:11></a> The snare is not now from within, but from without.<a name=111:12></a> The Gibeonites "did work wilily", and Joshua is deceived, and makes peace with them, neglecting to ask counsel of the Lord.<a name=111:13></a> Here was the real cause of the snare proving successful, for whenever dependence on God is lost for a single moment, be it even in the very flush of victory, failure must ensue.<a name=111:14></a>

		But what was his resource?<a name=113:10></a> He took a great stone and set it up there under an oak that was by the sanctuary of the Lord, and said unto all the people, "Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us, for it hath heard all the words which be spake unto us; it shall therefore be a witness unto you, lest ye deny your God".<a name=113:11></a> This stone typified Christ, and looking to Him as the only sure Witness, "the faithful and true", Joshua closes his course, setting forth, in this his last act, how effectual the discipline of God had been, for now his heart rests only in Him whom that stone typically foreshadowed.<a name=113:12></a> Hence, in the dependence of one taught of God he is earnest to maintain the truth of God, hopeless as to man, but assured and at rest because his hope is in God.<a name=113:13></a>

		Gideon was evidently a man who had pondered over the ways of the Lord, for his reply is, "Oh my Lord, if the Lord be with us, why then is all this befallen us, and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the Lord bring us out of Egypt?<a name=116:6></a> but now the Lord hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites".<a name=116:7></a> In this rejoinder we see that he not only knew how the Lord had dealt with Israel in time past, but also the judicial position in which they now were.<a name=116:8></a> He saw God alone on either side.<a name=116:9></a> Consequently the angel "looked upon him", or was turned towards him, and commissioned him to "go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not <i>I</i> sent thee?<a name=116:10></a>" The servant of God must know and believe that in God is the power which <i>alone</i> can set up or pull down; it is the foundation-stone in the soul for any deliverance.<a name=116:11></a> "Twice have I heard this, that power belongeth unto God".<a name=116:12></a>

		Great as was this promise, Gideon could not yet appropriate it; however wonderful and suited, he could not embrace it until he feels in his own soul the link between himself and God, and is assured of his own acceptance, and therefore he exclaims, "If now I have found grace in thy sight, shew me a sign that thou talkest with me".<a name=117:3></a> And then, having brought his offering, and set it forth according to the angel's directions, as we read in verses 18 - 22, the Lord accepts the offering, causes it to be consumed and disappears from Gideon's sight, thus giving him an unquestionable proof, not only of His own presence and power, but of Gideon's acceptance with Him.<a name=117:4></a> He had sought a sign, to enable his soul to trust in the promised succour of God in the great service appointed to him.<a name=117:5></a> For, as a fallen man estranged from God, he could see no ground for dependence, and the acceptance of the sign is almost too much for him.<a name=117:6></a> The Lord's manifestation of Himself convinces Gideon of His nearness to him, which naturally must be death to him, and of which he has the sense; so that he exclaims, "Alas, O Lord God!<a name=117:7></a> for because I have seen an angel of the Lord face to face".<a name=117:8></a> The <i>word</i> of the Lord now calms and settles his soul.<a name=117:9></a> "Peace be unto thee: thou shalt not die;" and thereon Gideon builds an altar, which denotes the relation in which he now stands with God, and which is the groundwork of his soul before he enters on his service.<a name=117:10></a> The altar, or access, is Jehovah-Shalom.<a name=117:11></a>

		This is what we find in Ruth, and herein consists the interest of her history, in which we learn how God led and enabled a woman, who was a member of the most despised family, a Moabite, to fill the most honoured position in the royal tribe of Israel; nay, to concentrate in herself the blessings of Rachel and of Leah.<a name=138:6></a> We cannot too carefully note the manner and spirit by which this great result was attained.<a name=138:7></a>

		But before we touch on the reward we may note another characteristic prominently presented and fully exemplified in Ruth's history, and that is, <i>simple obedience in the most servile and unconspicuous toil</i>.<a name=141:2></a> She enters the land of Israel inseparable from the once Naomi (pleasant), now reduced to Mara (bitter); but resigned to her circumstances, nay, content in them, she addresses herself to the smallest opening which is presented to her, which is always an evidence of a healthy and vigorous soul, and without hesitation or demur she embraces it.<a name=141:3></a> She says, "Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find grace".<a name=141:4></a>

		It is the most unequivocal proof of true energy when in any strait we are not only resigned but ready to embrace any little opening to us, able to humble ourselves thereto and to testify to every one, even to our own souls, that God has not forgotten us and that what is directly before us is quite sufficient to meet our necessities.<a name=141:5></a> We only require to be humble to find it so.<a name=141:6></a> If we were to say or feel otherwise we should impugn His care and interest on our behalf.<a name=141:7></a> Ruth sees that there is no opening for her but in gleaning, and to gleaning she addresses herself, and this was the <i>Lord's opening for her</i>.<a name=141:8></a> Very humble unconspicuous labour no doubt, but He sees not as man seeth, and He led her by the right way; to "the meek shall he teach his way", and therefore "her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech".<a name=141:9></a> "He that humbleth himself shall be exalted".<a name=141:10></a> When we are docile we are led to fulness of blessing.<a name=141:11></a> Unless we embrace the humble opening presented to us we shall never reach the goal of blessing.<a name=141:12></a> Ruth was the humble, laborious servant, and as <i>such</i> she receives her reward for her devotedness to Naomi.<a name=141:13></a> Mark!<a name=141:14></a> it is for her <i>devotion</i> she is rewarded, more than for her service.<a name=141:15></a> Boaz said to her, "It hath fully been shewed me,

		Boaz blessed her -- a blessing which he afterwards (like all blessers) shared in himself -- and he also commanded his young men, saying, "Let her glean among the sheaves, and reproach her not: and let fall some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not", Thus we see Ruth receives more on account of her devotion to Naomi than she obtains by her honest and continual toil; and this is always the case.<a name=142:2></a> However great the recompense for faithful service, that of devotion immeasurably exceeds it.<a name=142:3></a> Had Ruth gone to the field to glean as did the other handmaidens, she would have obtained her due, what her labour merited, <i>but no more</i>.<a name=142:4></a> But it was far otherwise with her: devotedness to one (Naomi) was the spring of all her work, and the result was to her, as we shall find it to ourselves when animated with a like spirit -- the in-gathering is exceeding abundant.<a name=142:5></a> And not only so, the devoted one is led on, step by step, until she attains full rest, honour and, finally, inheritance.<a name=142:6></a> The sequel of her history shews us this: she ultimately becomes the wife of Boaz, the true kinsman, who redeems the inheritance; and according to the blessing pronounced on her she builds up the royal house of David, even as Rachel and Leah built up the house of Israel.<a name=142:7></a> The poor Moabitess is brought into close proximity to the throne of Judah, and she makes the name of her kinsman-redeemer "famous" in Bethlehem Ephratah, the place of death and resurrection!<a name=142:8></a> A wondrous result this from so humble a beginning, but one in full keeping with God's ways in discipline.<a name=142:9></a>

		We read, "And they gathered together at Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured it out before the Lord, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned", <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#7:6">1 Samuel  7:6</a>.<a name=149:3></a> Such is always the true way -- to have the soul restored with God before we enter into conflict with any special enemies.<a name=149:4></a> Samuel leads God's people to this, and now they are prepared and waiting for the Lord's intervention; but the moment they prepare for the enemy by waiting on God, that moment Satan urges on his emissaries (the Philistines) to oppose and renew the strife, "When the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel".<a name=149:5></a> Israel, though contrite and restored in the presence of God, are not yet experienced enough in God's power on their behalf to be undisturbed by fear of the violence of man.<a name=149:6></a> A soul may be quite assured before God, and resting in His acceptance, who yet may greatly fear the violence of the wicked and the power of darkness.<a name=149:7></a> Nothing can relieve the soul of this terror but <i>experience</i>; I mean experience of God, the soul <i>making use</i> of the power of God which it enjoys in its acceptance.<a name=149:8></a> Peter had this experience after his rescue by the angel, when he said, "Now I know of a surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod", etc.<a name=149:9></a>

		Samuel had now established his title to judge Israel.<a name=151:2></a> By dependence on God he had received of the resources of God, and now he takes his place as judge of a delivered people.<a name=151:3></a> He went in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh; the latter must not be forgotten, for <i>there</i> he had proved his commission.<a name=151:4></a> Samuel dwelt at Ramah, and at home he cultivated what he proved abroad, for "there he built an altar unto the Lord".<a name=151:5></a>

		We have now traced how Samuel learned, by prayer and dependence on God, to deliver His people out of the greatest degradation and feebleness; and how in consequence He is their judge.<a name=151:6></a> And here (as I may so say) one era of his life, or the life of dependence, closes; but another begins -- for that is the peculiarity, and blessing, too, of the life of dependence, that no sooner have you reached <i>one</i> goal, perhaps at the end of a long laborious exercise, but you have to enter on another, consequent on the very position which, through the Lord's mercy, you have attained.<a name=151:7></a> Samuel, by dependence on God, has been vouchsafed signal deliverance from outside enemies.<a name=151:8></a> The Philistines are subdued, and he himself judges Israel.<a name=151:9></a> But, alas!<a name=151:10></a> it is with him as with us all; when nature comes in and works, he fails, and confusion is the result.<a name=151:11></a>

		It was clearly nature in Samuel to make his sons judges in the land when he was old.<a name=151:12></a> He had enjoyed for a long period of his life the fruits of his first great and deep exercises of dependence; but now, when he is old, he seems to lapse into worldly arrangements, in making his sons judges.<a name=151:13></a> It is not dependence on God now, but carnal policy, and it is unsuccessful: "his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment".<a name=151:14></a> We read in <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#8:4">1 Samuel  8:4</a>, 5: "Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah, and said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There were two painful truths in the petition of the elders which must have greatly tried Samuel.<a name=152:4></a> First, the failure of his policy through his own sons.<a name=152:5></a> This is the point where every man would feel most, and the better the man, the more would he feel it.<a name=152:6></a> Secondly, the wilfulness and ungodliness of the nation in asking for a king.<a name=152:7></a> Poor Samuel!<a name=152:8></a> His family had disappointed him, and his nation had grievously requited all his labours and service.<a name=152:9></a> It is not now the Philistines: it is their own inward corruption.<a name=152:10></a> What a moment!<a name=152:11></a> What could the aged Samuel do?<a name=152:12></a> We read, "<i>And Samuel prayed unto the Lord</i>".<a name=152:13></a> The perplexing strait has been used to restore his soul into the old and well-known channel of dependence; and, as is ever the case to the really dependent one seeking His glory, God answered him in a most gracious, soothing way, entering into all His servant's feelings, as follows: "they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them".<a name=152:14></a> Samuel was the link between the judges and the kingdom, or the type of the faithful in the interval between the manifested failure of Israel, as a people governed by God, and the setting up of the kingdom.<a name=152:15></a> Samson properly closed that period, which mainly was characterised by power through human agency, of which he was personally the greatest example.<a name=152:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Samuel is now educated in a very different line from that in which his public history opened.<a name=153:9></a> Now an old man, and at the close of his life, and of his testimony to the blessedness of dependence on God, he must endure with patience, and cooperate, as long as he can.<a name=153:10></a> While this experiment is being carried out, he must suppress all the sad and bitter feelings which might crowd on his mind -- he must wait on God, and wait for the end, until God brings it <i>to</i> an end.<a name=153:11></a> His manner and spirit in this sad work is very encouraging to us.<a name=153:12></a> It is easier to rise up and repose in God, reckoning on His deliverance from open enemies, like the Philistines, than to acknowledge and co-operate in all that professes well around you.<a name=153:13></a> Samuel, in obedience to the Lord, submits to the trial of man's king, accepting him and owning him as acknowledged of God, until the contrary was manifested; but, at the same time, observes two lines of action, namely, faithfulness to the people, in warning them of their apostasy, and the retribution due to it, but also faithfulness to God -- which led him to disown the king the moment he relinquished the principles ordained of God.<a name=153:14></a>

		David was two days at Ziklag after his return from conquest before he heard of the death of Saul; for it was on the "third day" that the event and the manner of it is related to him by an Amalekite, who says, "I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord".<a name=182:2></a> But how does David receive these tidings and trophies?<a name=182:3></a> He "took hold on his clothes, and rent them .<a name=182:4></a>.<a name=182:5></a>.<a name=182:6></a> and they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even"; and as for the bearer of them, he ordered his immediate execution.<a name=182:7></a> When judgment from God falls on His people, however deserved by them and predicted by the faithful, yet to the godly it is always solemn and affecting; and at such a moment no true David could remember the benefit that might accrue to himself from the event.<a name=182:8></a> The soul enters rather into the cause of the divine interposition; and the sense that God is acting silences self.<a name=182:9></a> How many and great were the revolutions which had exercised David's spirit those three days!<a name=182:10></a> Re had not only known the Lord's peculiar mercy to himself, but now he is made cognisant of this singular judgment, which occupies him so much in its connection with Israel, that for the moment he overlooks its importance to himself.<a name=182:11></a> Moreover, he could not suffer the Amalekite, who had reported the news, to live; for he was proving his title to the throne in his unflinching war with the Amalekites, in contrast to Saul, who had lost the kingdom by sparing Amalek (<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#15">1 Samuel  15</a>), and who now, by God's unerring retribution, is slain, and stripped of his kingly ornaments by an Amalekite!<a name=182:12></a> It was consistent, therefore, with God's way and will that David should establish his title by relentless vengeance on Amalek, and doubtless the Lord in His mercy exasperated him thus ere he reached the throne against the enemy of Israel by

		To the godly soul there is a fresh demand for counsel from God as each difficulty or opposition disappears, because he requires to ascertain how he may use the advantage aright, and there is often much lost for want of judgment.<a name=183:4></a> David now "enquired of the Lord, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah?<a name=183:5></a> And the Lord said unto him, Go up.<a name=183:6></a> And David said, Whither shall I go up?<a name=183:7></a> And he said, Unto Hebron", <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#2:1">2 Samuel  2:1</a>.<a name=183:8></a> What simple, happy and interesting dependence!<a name=183:9></a> In what a different spirit he leaves Ziklag to that in which he entered it!<a name=183:10></a> What blessed fruition of God's discipline does he now enjoy going up into Hebron, led and sustained by the plain word of God!<a name=183:11></a> What power and simplicity characterise the walk of the man upheld thereby!<a name=183:12></a> David goes to Hebron, and "his men that were with him .<a name=183:13></a>.<a name=183:14></a>.<a name=183:15></a> every man with his household".<a name=183:16></a> When faith in God is unhindered by nature, it embraces all that concerns me.<a name=183:17></a> I learn that God's interest in me must embrace <i>my</i> interests, or it would not be perfect consideration for me.<a name=183:18></a>

		If a hair of my head cannot fall to the ground without Him, it is plain to faith that everything which concerns me is now within the circle of His hand.<a name=183:19></a> David, therefore, acting in this mind, brought up all his men, and every man his household.<a name=183:20></a> Nothing less would suit that faith in the word of God which had said to him, "Go up unto Hebron".<a name=183:21></a> When we begin in faith and dependence, every circumstance will establish not only the faith but the wisdom of our course; hence we find, in verse 4, that the "men of Judah came and anointed David king over the house of Judah".<a name=183:22></a> But though now set up in royal dignity, it was a position very far short of that for which he was destined and anointed by Samuel.<a name=183:23></a> Seven years and six months must still elapse before the whole nation acknowledge him as king.<a name=183:24></a> (verse 11.<a name=183:25></a>) And there was still to be "long war between the house of Saul and the house of David", though the latter should wax stronger and stronger.<a name=183:26></a> By

		This event, which seemed to human vision so great a misfortune, eventually weakened the house of Saul in a remarkable way (chapter 4: 1), for Ishbosheth is slain by two of his captains, and David's rival removed without any reflection on David, which he could not have escaped had it been brought about by the sword of Abner.<a name=185:12></a> Oh!<a name=185:13></a> if we would but trust the Lord, we should find that what we, in our feeble judgment, regard as against us, He has ordered as entirely for us.<a name=185:14></a> David humbled before God, and, waiting on Him, deals with this treachery as became him; righteously visiting with death the perpetrators of the murder, and accepting the result as from the Lord, for the last obstacle to his acknowledgment as king of Israel was now gone; for we read (chapter 5: 1), "Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron .<a name=185:15></a>.<a name=185:16></a>.<a name=185:17></a> and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the Lord: and they anointed David king over Israel".<a name=185:18></a> In <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#12:38">1 Chronicles  12:38</a> it is detailed to us the character and

	<div class="paragraph">
		The first recorded act of David after his elevation to the throne is his attempt to bring back the ark of God; a true and godly desire -- for to render unto the Lord the first-fruits of our increase is the natural action of the soul which is consciously receiving from Him; but how often we mar in execution our best intentions, on account of the influence of our associations; and our associations are always in keeping with our practical state.<a name=186:4></a> David, in his spirit, desires to see the ark of God restored, "for it had not been inquired at in the days of Saul".<a name=186:5></a> But he, doubtless, much engrossed at this time with the heads of the army, as the means by which he had reached the throne, consults with <i>them</i> about bringing back the ark, instead of with the Lord; the consequence of which is, as is ever the case, a human devised plan is decided on; a cart drawn by kine is appointed to carry it, instead of the Levites, which was the divine way.<a name=186:6></a> What could result from such an arrangement but chastening in the display of God's holiness?<a name=186:7></a> Uzzah is slain; a great check to David, and reminding him that the Lord was near, and that if he would do the <i>works</i> of God he must do them in the <i>mind</i> of God.<a name=186:8></a> But he does not seem to have apprehended this at once.<a name=186:9></a> We read he was displeased and was afraid of the Lord, and said, "How shall the ark of the Lord come to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#13">1 Chronicles  13</a>- 16, we read of two conflicts with the Philistines by David, between his first essay as to bringing up the ark and the final accomplishment of it.<a name=187:3></a> Whether they actually took place at that period, or as related in Samuel, may be a question; but the Spirit of God always gives us the moral order of events in Chronicles, and I fully believe that it is thus related in the latter, with the intent to shew us that the lesson which David needed to be taught then, and in need of which he failed the first time, was that so far from borrowing any of the devices of the Philistines, he was to have nothing to do with them, except to overcome them.<a name=187:4></a> If he had truly and deeply apprehended the nature and extent of the power of God, as at Baal-perazim, where God "broke in upon his enemies like the breaking forth of waters", in answer to the simple and blessed dependence with which he inquired of Him, and waited on Him, step by step, he would have been saved from the sorrow and humiliation of Perez-uzzah.<a name=187:5></a> Even after obtaining signal victories over the world how often, alas!<a name=187:6></a> do we introduce some worldly element into our worship, which will neutralise our truest purposes.<a name=187:7></a> If I do not realise the entire setting aside of the world and of any association with it, I am sure to retain some idea borrowed from it, which contravenes the truth and grace of God.<a name=187:8></a> In the first of these conflicts David is taught what personal victory the Lord vouchsafes to His servant when he trusts Him; for there he had inquired of the Lord in as full dependence as when he was a refugee in the wilderness of Maon; and dependence yields all the more savour when our position is such as might seem, humanly speaking, to place us above it.<a name=187:9></a> God had promised that He would deliver the Philistines into his hand; and so great was their defeat that David said, "God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore he called the name of the place Baal-perazim".<a name=187:10></a>

		Now it is one thing for me to feel and know that I am personally victorious over the world (I can have no rest until I do), and quite another thing to know that it is God that setteth me on my high places; that is, that He is subduing my enemies for me; and still further, that it is <i>when the sound of God is heard</i> that I bestir myself and go forth to conflict (<a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#14:15">1 Chronicles  14:15</a>); for then I know that He has "gone forth before me to smite the host of the Philistines".<a name=188:1></a>

		At the end of three months, however, David having been warned, chastened, and most graciously instructed, and hearing of the blessing vouchsafed to the house of Obed-edom from the presence of Him whose holiness had so lately broken forth in judgment to wither up the presumption of nature, prepares to bring up the ark of God to the city of David with gladness, and he now makes an announcement which virtually is a confession of his own mistake, even that "None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the Lord chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever".<a name=188:3></a> The details of this interesting event are given to us in <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#15">1 Chronicles  15</a>and 16, and we shall do well to note the spirit of David on the occasion.<a name=188:4></a> He acts as both priest and king, and orders and appoints everything, and is, moreover, himself clothed with an ephod and robe of fine linen, and dances before the Lord with all his might.<a name=188:5></a> In fact his whole course and way is a practical expression of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#132">Psalm  132</a>, which was the utterance of his heart at the moment.<a name=188:6></a> How different to his first attempt to bring up the ark was this, in power, testimony, and joy of heart!<a name=188:7></a> How imposingly expressive is the gladness of the heart when engaged with the Lord, and how indifferent to all carnal judgment!<a name=188:8></a> This must have been the happiest moment in David's life, as also the most honoured one, when he said, "Arise, O

	<div class="paragraph">
		What a bright and blessed moment, after all his sorrows and discipline!<a name=189:4></a> What fulness of joy does his occupation with the Lord give him, and with what divine skill does he direct all the details of the Levitical service!<a name=189:5></a> There is no jar in the scene, save that of the daughter of Saul, whose spirit out of tune with the whole scene can have no sympathy with him, nor can she understand it, for she despises David in her heart.<a name=189:6></a> Thus in this bright hour he suffers from unsuited association.<a name=189:7></a> And how often is this the case!<a name=189:8></a> Many a one who passes acceptably in the muddy light of profession soon betrays himself, if placed in the bright light of God's presence.<a name=189:9></a> But if this were a cloud in the fair sky which now overshadowed David, it bore a blessing and deliverance for him too; for this unequal association was to fetter him no more.<a name=189:10></a> The line of separation is from henceforth drawn between them for ever.<a name=189:11></a> In the wilderness God had given him an Abigail, a kindred spirit to share his rejection; and now, as he conducts the ark of God to its rest in mount Zion, in the boundless joy of a soul rejoicing in the Lord's exaltation, he breaks the last link of his alliance with the world; his holy joy alienates the heart of her whose innate worldliness of spirit is hereby disclosed.<a name=189:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It seems likely that it was when David returned to bless his house (<a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#16:43">1 Chronicles  16:43</a>) that he uttered <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#30">Psalm  30</a>.<a name=189:13></a> He could then say, "Thou hast turned from me my mourning into dancing: thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness".<a name=189:14></a> He had now risen to the height of prosperity and could say, "I shall never be moved".<a name=189:15></a> His soul was simply enjoying all at the hands of the Lord; and here he exclaims, "I will extol thee, O Lord; for thou hast lifted me up, and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me".<a name=189:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"That same night the word of the Lord came unto Nathan, saying, Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the Lord, Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in", etc.<a name=190:4></a>; and he goes on to say how the Lord will build him a house!<a name=190:5></a> When our cup is filled, we are liable, in the elation which the sense of God's favour has secured for us, to propose services with an honest purpose for which we may be unqualified.<a name=190:6></a> The word of God will always define our proper place to us, as it here does to David, while it is accompanied by an enlarged and wonderful unfolding of the Lord's interest in him personally.<a name=190:7></a> It is well to have great zeal for His glory, but the word which corrects us in our inopportune designs is sure to unfold to us the measureless nature of His own interest in us.<a name=190:8></a> This David learns here, and he can now go and sit before the Lord in full communion with His mind, and in that self-abasement which His presence alone can produce.<a name=190:9></a> However we may praise Him for His gifts and receive them from Him, yet while we sit in the "house of cedars", we may mistake our due calling and place; but when we "sit before the Lord", listening to the unfoldings of His mind and interest for us, all things fall into their right place, and we exclaim, "Who am I that thou hast brought me hitherto?<a name=190:10></a>"

		But after a while he is made to feel still more keenly the dearth and parching drought of Israel; "the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land"; he was sensibly to feel the sufferings of God's people, even though they had not been incurred by wilfulness of his own, but at the same time he was to reckon on God and say, "The Lord is my helper".<a name=201:2></a> This was our blessed Lord's experience, only in the perfection which always characterised Him; and to this very scene He refers, when in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4">Luke  4</a>.<a name=201:3></a> He felt His rejection by Israel, and how their hearts were closed towards Himself; and He makes use of it to illustrate to His audience that He was not without resource.<a name=201:4></a> If acceptance failed Him in Israel, the same blessed God who had provided a Gentile widow to be the hostess of Elijah would provide reception for the Lord of the earth in the hearts of the desolate Gentiles outside Israel.<a name=201:5></a>

		So here, with Elijah, when he found that she willingly discontinued her own work, forgetting the claims her necessity had on her, he is encouraged to ask more, and becomes assured, too, that this is the widow to whom God has sent him.<a name=202:3></a> She was willing to share with him all she could, but when the prophet asks her for what she had not, she is compelled to disclose the full tale of her poverty; and then it is that Elijah rises up in all the greatness of Him whose servant he was.<a name=202:4></a> How bright is that moment to the soul which has been carefully threading its way, following the ray of divine light, clear to itself, but as yet shedding no light beyond, when it enters with full intelligence into the purpose of God!<a name=202:5></a>

		Bat more than this, he is conducted into a deeper mystery, even that of resurrection from the dead; he had seen death and its terrors arrested; but now being brought in contact with the depth of sorrow (for a widow losing her only son, her last link to earth, is the most penetrating illustration of human sorrow and bereavement), he is used of God to display His power and grace in overcoming death, and introducing life anew: and thus in a pre-eminent way he is educated in the mightiest work of God.<a name=203:7></a> The exercises of his soul at this time, because of death charged on himself by the sorrowing widow (verse 18), and the experiences of his soul as to the power of God in giving life from the dead, must have been peculiar and wonderful: and very grateful must have been the testimony of the widow after the resurrection of her son, "Now by this I know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of the Lord in thy mouth is truth".<a name=203:8></a> God was honoured and His servant vindicated in the great work of resurrection.<a name=203:9></a>

		Elijah having disappeared, Elisha's career is begun, and the first test of the grace conferred on him is Jordan, the type of actual death, not of the power of death, but as the last barrier between the wilderness and Canaan.<a name=215:2></a> A very suited test was this to be encountered by one endowed like Elisha; and the first, because he must know at the outset the power which introduces him into God's inheritance, and that Jordan is the portal to it.<a name=215:3></a> Unless we pass Jordan we are not in the land, nor have we learnt how God will sustain us there, and how He will drive out before us all our adversaries.<a name=215:4></a> Elijah had crossed Jordan, leaving the land in testimony against its evil, heaven being then opened to him as his own personal portion.<a name=215:5></a> Elisha re-crosses it, and re-enters the land in grace, and in the power of God's Spirit, which was to bear down every difficulty.<a name=215:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Very blessed are the exercises to which he is subjected.<a name=215:7></a> Even as the Spirit in double power descended on the church in consequence and in virtue of her union with her ascended Lord, so is it with Elisha: his eye had traced the power and glory of God's grace in removing His servant unto Himself, and now he is a witness of the same power on earth in the waters of Jordan being parted asunder for him to enter on his appointed service; and thereby he must have learnt that through God every barrier would be broken down.<a name=215:8></a> Like Stephen, he had seen how God had raised man to His own glory, and like him, too, he proved that he himself was, through the power of God, victorious over death.<a name=215:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Elisha's first sphere of service in the land is Jericho, and the first opposition he has to encounter is that of those who, by their very calling, ought to have co-operated with him.<a name=215:10></a> The sons of the prophets, though they had seen and owned the power which clave the waters of Jordan, refuse to believe in the rapture of Elijah, and raise questions prompted by unbelief, until Elisha suffers them to do as

		they would, merely to expose their own folly; for when people will not heed the warnings of the Spirit they must be left to learn by their own mistakes.<a name=216:1></a> Elisha learns on the other hand that no help or cooperation is to be expected from the sons of the prophets -- the ordained ministry of the day -- and that he must be prepared to encounter their ignorance and inapprehensiveness of the mind of God; a very necessary discovery for the servant of God in an evil day, and in such times of declension as Elisha was called to serve in.<a name=216:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Jericho comes after Jordan.<a name=216:3></a> Having surveyed the full range of God's grace -- its glorious blessedness in the rapture of Elijah into heaven, and its power on earth in making a way for him through Jordan -- he must, like Saul of Tarsus, be a minister of it in the place which judicially is at the greatest distance from God in the land of Israel -- the place of the curse.<a name=216:4></a> The men of the city in describing the place sum up in a few words the history of the whole world.<a name=216:5></a> "The situation is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is naught, and the ground barren".<a name=216:6></a> What a picture!<a name=216:7></a> Fair to look upon, but unproductive of what alone can meet the necessities of man.<a name=216:8></a> Elisha is the one empowered to meet their need.<a name=216:9></a> It is a fine moment, and one of deep edification to his soul, when he is thus allowed to be the instrument of God's grace, and to pronounce the word of the Lord: "I have healed these waters", after putting salt therein out of a new cruse, and the "waters were healed unto this day".<a name=216:10></a>

		Now this service, which must have established the heart of Elisha in the very grace which he ministered, was brought about by very simple though deeply effective education.<a name=216:11></a> He who has learnt for himself the grace and power of Jehovah in heaven above and on earth beneath, knows how to act for Him in scenes morally most distant from Him, as was Jericho; and thus was it with our Lord on the earth.<a name=216:12></a> But if Elisha be the minister of mercy, he must experience what it is to be rejected, and that in the very place most distinguished by the favour of God and

	<div class="paragraph">
		Elisha goes from thence to Carmel, for retirement I should suppose, but ere long he returns to Samaria -- the scene of service.<a name=217:7></a> We must remember that he is properly filling up Elijah's mission which began with prayer (necessity on the earth looking to God) and closed in glory.<a name=217:8></a> And from <i>this</i> (the manifestation of the power of God in opening heaven for the reception of man) Elisha began; and, therefore, in studying his history we should expect to learn how the Lord conducts and uses one who thus begins from above and is not of the earth.<a name=217:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Samaria he is introduced into a scene which discloses to him the political and moral state of all Israel; chapter 3.<a name=217:10></a> Moab has rebelled, and the king of Judah is found in unholy league with the kings of Israel and Edom; and the destruction of all three is threatened, not from the power of the enemy but the failure of water.<a name=217:11></a> What a condition and association for Jehoshaphat, the Lord's anointed, and one who was really a godly man, to be in!<a name=217:12></a> It is he, however, who at this juncture raises the inquiry, which is always that of a heart which knows the Lord but which is away from Him: "Is there not here a prophet of the Lord?<a name=217:13></a>" And this brings Elisha on the scene.<a name=217:14></a> An important moment it is to him: important as to the testimony of God which he bore, and as to the personal instruction with which it was fraught.<a name=217:15></a> Standing in the midst of

	<div class="paragraph">
		the moral ruin of Israel, of which the scene before him was the witness, he, like the blessed One in later times, on the one hand denounces its apostasy, and on the other links himself with the little that remained for God.<a name=218:1></a> "What have I to do with thee?<a name=218:2></a>" he says to the king of Israel; "were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee".<a name=218:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But though he can both feel the desolation of Israel, and recognise the remnant, he finds that he is not in a moment up to the mind of God concerning a state of things so discordant to the spiritual mind.<a name=218:4></a> He must pause and send for a minstrel.<a name=218:5></a> "And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the Lord came upon him".<a name=218:6></a> His mind must be diverted, and separated from the confusion and despair around him, before it could be so in tune as to be used of the Lord.<a name=218:7></a> His ministry was from above, and therefore, whenever there was danger of his falling into the current of things down here, it was necessary that he should be not only diverted from it, but so guided in the midst of it as to be free to receive and convey God's mind and purpose.<a name=218:8></a> Music is used to accomplish this in the soul of Elisha; and the effect produced typifies that calm, unperturbed state of mind in which one must be to receive the mind of God above and beyond all that is passing around.<a name=218:9></a> If I would know that which is from above, even the counsel and mind of God, I must in myself be calm as to the circumstances around me; otherwise I shall not be able to see it or to act on it.<a name=218:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Elisha had now properly commenced his public ministry amid the apostasy.<a name=218:11></a> Hitherto he had been the minister of grace and judgment in a more private way; but now the wide-spread moral desolation of Israel is before him, and he learns to be calm in the midst of it, ere he announces the signal interposition of God on behalf of His people.<a name=218:12></a> This is education of the utmost importance.<a name=218:13></a> It is a great moment to the soul when it can stand still and see the salvation of the Lord; and especially so with Elisha; for we must again remember that he comes in contact with the ruin and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		destitution of Israel, after having started with the glorious manifestation of God's grace.<a name=219:1></a> He had seen first what God is, and now he is learning down here how ruined and necessitous are the people of the God of grace and glory, because of their apostasy and unbelief.<a name=219:2></a> And it is in meeting these varied distresses of God's people, and being exercised in his own soul as to the way in which God would meet each, that he himself is enlarged in the power and resources of God.<a name=219:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next scene in which we find Elisha (chapter 4: 1) is where he is appealed to by a certain woman of the wives of the prophets, who cries to him, "Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the Lord: and the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen".<a name=219:4></a> Here what is noticeable is not so much the nature of the distress as that a widow of one of the Lord's prophets in His own land should be reduced to such straits; it reveals to us how entirely the nation must have forgotten and neglected the care of God, when such a case could be found there unrelieved.<a name=219:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Elisha is here from God to be a witness of this misery, and at first he is quite unprepared for such a case and says, "What shall I do for thee?<a name=219:6></a>" The extremity of it doubtless astonished him.<a name=219:7></a> Here was he, knowing the greatness and power of God toward His people, yet cognizant of the existence of distress peculiar and unprecedented, and it would seem at first as if it were beyond him.<a name=219:8></a> He had never before encountered such misery, but it is in such cases that the true servant is taught to trust in God, and by thus trusting to know what to do.<a name=219:9></a> Now the first thing for the heart that is simply resting in God is to take into account every provision of God personally possessed; and this is what Elisha does.<a name=219:10></a> "Hast thou anything in the house?<a name=219:11></a>" is his next question, and when he hears that she has a pot of oil he directs her to borrow of her neighbours empty vessels -- to be indebted to them only for empty vessels!<a name=219:12></a> for these were to contain God's abundant supplies; and Elisha is vouchsafed the privilege of knowing that there was

	<div class="paragraph">
		But, not only was Elisha to witness these things, he was to experience them himself; not only was he to see things here in striking contrast to that manifestation of glory from which he started, but he must <i>feel</i> the contrast; and if he minister to God's people in their necessities out of His fulness, he must feel the necessity and must suffer himself in God's inheritance, in spirit with Him who had not where to lay His head.<a name=220:2></a> He, the Lord of the earth, was indebted to a few women who "ministered to him of their substance", and Elisha is here found in somewhat similar circumstances.<a name=220:3></a> (verse 8.<a name=220:4></a>) A woman, a Shunammite, provides bread and lodging for him, and in this association he is to pass through in miniature the hopes and sorrows of God's people.<a name=220:5></a> God often leads His servants into a small circle of service, wherein the principles of His full purpose are practically made known.<a name=220:6></a> It was so with Noah in the ark; with Abraham on mount Moriah; with Paul with regard to the church; with Elisha here.<a name=220:7></a> Israel, at this time, was like the Shunammite; her husband was old, and there was no child for a continuation of their name; so the nation was decaying, and ready to pass away, and there was no heir to carry it into new life and hopes.<a name=220:8></a>

		Gehazi, who, I suppose, represents Israel after the flesh, sees and tells the prophet this state of things.<a name=220:9></a> Elisha promises a son, and a son is born.<a name=220:10></a> But before the harvest, before the feast of ingathering, the child dies, the hope of the family is no more, and the mother flies to the prophet in her distress.<a name=220:11></a> He is in Carmel, in retirement, and the depth to which Israel is reduced, as typified in this woman, is as yet unrevealed to him by the Lord (verse 27).<a name=220:12></a> But now he was not only to learn it, but his own soul was to pass through the wondrous way and manner of God's deliverance

		of His people from this, their low estate.<a name=221:1></a> This is quite new experience to Elisha, and only step by step is he brought into it.<a name=221:2></a> He must be taught that Gehazi and the prophet's own staff will not do; that no intervention will repair death; nothing but life can meet death, and this Elisha learns in his own person.<a name=221:3></a> It is he who is, through the power of God, made to communicate life to the dead child: a simple and distinct type of Him, who, Himself the Eternal Life, came into this world to impart it; but a wondrous place for a man to be set in, and a wondrous display of God's grace to him, ignorant and unacquainted as he had been with the sorrow that he is now empowered to relieve.<a name=221:4></a> In all the exercises which Elisha here passed through, as he walked to and fro in the house, and went up again and stretched himself upon the child and prayed, he is taught, though in a comparatively feeble way, what our Lord passed through so fully; on the one hand, the terribleness of death; and on the other, the blessedness of life.<a name=221:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We next find Elisha at Gilgal; and here he has to meet the dearth of the land, the sons of the prophets sitting before him.<a name=221:6></a> The one who has learned the power and grace of God, as the life-giving God, can easily, trusting in Him in the face of all professors, relieve the casual distresses which afflict us in passing through this evil scene.<a name=221:7></a> He says to his servant, "Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets"; but what Elisha, as the servant of God, is preparing, is spoiled by the inter-meddling of the unbelieving.<a name=221:8></a> The wild gourds, though supposed by the one who gathered them to be an acquisition, only added death to the pottage; and in the same way do all human additions to faith and to God's way bring death.<a name=221:9></a> Elisha, still trusting in the life-giving God, is equal to the emergency.<a name=221:10></a> He casts in meal and the deadly element is destroyed.<a name=221:11></a> A soul that is simply trusting in God will ever be able to carry out its purpose; for it is of faith, though it may meet with interruptions and hindrances when it least expects them.<a name=221:12></a> Faith always increases

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have now reached chapter 5 of 2 Kings, where Elisha is to act as the prophet of God outside the limits of Israel.<a name=222:2></a> He has been practically educated in the power of God, and therefore is prepared to say of Naaman the Syrian, "Let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel".<a name=222:3></a> And when Naaman obeys the summons, Elisha only sends a messenger to him, saying, "Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean".<a name=222:4></a> Although quite ready to succour the Syrian leper, he is no respecter of persons, and preserves the dignity of God's servant.<a name=222:5></a> He is there to send him forth for salvation and cure, but he makes no account of him as captain of the host of Syria.<a name=222:6></a> And hence, when Naaman is healed, Elisha refuses to take anything from him, in the true independence of the servant of God.<a name=222:7></a> He would help the Gentile, but not receive from him.<a name=222:8></a> And in principle we learn by the judgment passed on Gehazi that if we grasp at and acquire the goods of the world, we shall inevitably involve ourselves in its leprosy.<a name=222:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We should note, that in the history of Elisha there is less apparent need for discipline than in other servants.<a name=222:10></a> He is before us as endowed from above, and when we follow him, we see how aptly and beautifully the grace of God flows from the vessel according to the need it encounters; and though we do not see the discipline through which he learnt so to yield himself to God, that he could fully display His mind -- we know that it must have been so; and also that the best evidence of true effective discipline is the meekness and simplicity of heart with which I act according to the mind of God in the various and distinct cases occurring to me.<a name=222:11></a> In this light no history is more interesting

		Chapter 6.<a name=223:4></a> Here we have a circle of wondrous action reaching from a personal to a national calamity; embracing, I may say, in principle, every grade of human sorrow.<a name=223:5></a> First, the sons of the prophets, feeling the straitness of the place, propose to Elisha to go unto Jordan, and dwell there.<a name=223:6></a> He goes with them; and as one was felling a beam the axe head fell into the water, and he cried, "Alas, master!<a name=223:7></a> for it was borrowed".<a name=223:8></a> Elisha immediately enters into his sorrow and distress, which was not merely the loss, but the man's credit was at stake, because it was borrowed, and the prophet's tender consideration for his distress is very touching; there is in him both tenderness and power to meet every anxious human sensibility.<a name=223:9></a> "And the man of God said, Where fell it?<a name=223:10></a> And he shewed him the place.<a name=223:11></a> And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither: and the iron did swim.<a name=223:12></a> Therefore said he, Take it up to thee.<a name=223:13></a> And he put out his hand, and took it".<a name=223:14></a>

		We next find Elisha bringing about the defeat of the king of Syria, by warning the king of Israel of his approach; chapter 6: 9.<a name=223:15></a> And the king of Syria being apprised of this, and consequently exasperated against Elisha, sends spies to find out his abode; and, having discovered it to be Dothan, he sends thither horses and chariots, and a great host, and compassed the city: all this warlike array being thought necessary to secure the person of one poor unarmed man -- a striking evidence (even as it was in a later day, when a company with swords and staves was sent out to take the blessed One) that the ungodly instinctively feel their own helplessness in the presence of the power of God, even when it only acts on their fellow-man.<a name=223:16></a>

		The magnitude of this Syrian host was such, that Elisha's servant was terrified, and says, "Alas, my master!<a name=224:1></a> how shall we do?<a name=224:2></a>" And Elisha, in the power of that faith which had quieted his own soul, replies, "Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them".<a name=224:3></a> "If God be for us, who can be against us?<a name=224:4></a>" was the experience of his soul; and every anxiety of his own being disposed of, he can intercede for others; he prays that his servant may be assured by that vision of faith which his own eye rested on.<a name=224:5></a> "Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see".<a name=224:6></a> It is not enough for me to rest by faith myself on God's succour, or to ask others to do so, but I must seek to establish them in the power of it.<a name=224:7></a> Readily the Lord grants his request.<a name=224:8></a> The eyes of the young man are opened, and he sees the mountain full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.<a name=224:9></a>

		Hezekiah, in his history, presents to us two things: the first, how he was strengthened to succeed in renewing the testimony of the Lord in a very exemplary way, at a time when everything had sunk to the lowest state, and was to all appearance in irretrievable ruin; secondly, how he was taught to rest in God, while his soul was brought to a conviction of the end and desolation of everything here.<a name=228:9></a> It is very interesting to dwell on a history like this, and to observe how God leads on His servant, uses him to do His will and to walk in His ways, and yet teaches him, that, however he has succeeded, or has been a channel of success, still if he turns aside and depends on man, all is forfeited.<a name=228:10></a>

		The period which I have hastily sketched occurred within the first fourteen years of Hezekiah's reign, a prosperous, useful time; but the more useful any one is, the more he requires to be brought to an end of himself, and to find that his all is in God.<a name=231:8></a> We find some of His servants deeply chastened at first, in order to <i>prepare</i> them for a useful course; and some after a useful period are brought low and afflicted in order that they might learn how truly and fully God, in His own blessed self, is paramount to everything.<a name=231:9></a>

		His sickness must have occurred in the fourteenth year of his reign, for, from his sickness, fifteen years were added unto his life; and as he reigned only twenty-nine years, it must therefore have occurred in the fourteenth year.<a name=232:1></a> Its being related as subsequent to the second invasion by Sennacherib is, I conclude, on account of its having a typical import: for Hezekiah's exercises during his sickness set forth what Israel will go through before their final deliverance, it is a beautiful and interesting sight to behold Hezekiah for fourteen years (twice seven, a doubly perfect period) walking on the earth before God in dignity and faithfulness.<a name=232:2></a>

		But now we have to observe him and to learn from him in far different circumstances, even as one oppressed and intimidated by the king of Assyria; and deeply and sorely exercised in his own soul before God.<a name=232:3></a> He appears to have lost his faith in the first invasion of Sennacherib, because we can hardly imagine that Sennacherib persisted in his first invasion after receiving the fine which he had imposed.<a name=232:4></a> The history is simply this: In the fourteenth year of Hezekiah's reign, Sennacherib came up and laid siege to certain cities of Judah.<a name=232:5></a> At that time Hezekiah bought him off and stipulated to pay him a certain sum or ransom.<a name=232:6></a> Subsequent to this Sennacherib came up again (possibly on his return from Egypt), and then he threatened Jerusalem; and it was between these two invasions that Hezekiah by a great sickness was led into such deep exercise of soul.<a name=232:7></a> For fourteen years he had walked with God and prospered.<a name=232:8></a> Then, for the first time, failure appears in his course.<a name=232:9></a> Instead of repelling the invasion of the king of Assyria, as he would at one time have done, he buys him off.<a name=232:10></a>

		Hezekiah was an excellent and an eminently useful man, one who had walked before God in truth and with a perfect heart.<a name=234:2></a> His suffering in view of death was not because of a doubt of his final salvation, but it was the contemplation of death, as that which must sever him from all that interested and engaged him here.<a name=234:3></a> Could any man who felt himself the centre of usefulness and power here, independently of other considerations, take it lightly that he should be deprived of all this position and sphere of interest by the stern power of death?<a name=234:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The experience of Hezekiah tells us how a man of God -- a regenerate soul -- feels the wrench.<a name=234:6></a> Of course we are not taking into account how a Christian, knowing that he has life in Christ at the other side of the grave, apart from and above the flesh, would pass through this ordeal.<a name=234:7></a> Yet he, too, must pass through it.<a name=234:8></a> And that he does so victoriously is not because it is less real to him than it was to Hezekiah, but because he has received, through grace, life in the risen Christ -- a life which confers on him infinitely more than he loses in death.<a name=234:9></a> But it is necessary in order that we should understand that the giving up of our existence as man is a thing that must be now learnt morally in the cross of Christ; and that this giving up (that is, death) is no light thing; nay, that it is in itself an exceeding bitter thing, but yet a thing that <i>must</i> be; and that a man's goodness and usefulness here, instead of mitigating the desperateness of the blow, aggravates it and imparts a deeper agony to it.<a name=234:10></a>

		This writing of Hezekiah, it will be seen, is the Spirit's account of the exercise which took place in him during this severe discipline.<a name=235:9></a> But when he comes to the words, "O Lord, I am oppressed: undertake for me", there is evidently a new light in his soul; he enters into resurrection -- in hope.<a name=235:10></a> He can now say, "O Lord, by these things men live, and in all these things is the life of my spirit: so wilt thou recover me, and make me to live.<a name=235:11></a>.<a name=235:12></a>.<a name=235:13></a>.<a name=235:14></a> Thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption [there is also the sense of the Lord's forgiveness]: for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.<a name=235:15></a>.<a name=235:16></a>.<a name=235:17></a>.<a name=235:18></a> The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day".<a name=235:19></a>

		Isaiah prophesied in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah.<a name=239:7></a> The first notice we have of him is that a vision was given him and this is important, as defining the nature and line of the truth of which he is to be the witness.<a name=239:8></a> It concerns Judah and Jerusalem; the royal tribe, and the city of God, and the apostasy of Judah.<a name=239:9></a> "My people doth not consider .<a name=239:10></a>.<a name=239:11></a>.<a name=239:12></a> from the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it", and yet "Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness".<a name=239:13></a>

		Let us briefly review.<a name=243:8></a> In chapter 9: 1 - 7, the future blessing of Israel is foreseen, beginning in Galilee of the Gentiles, and reaching on to its consummation in the kingdom.<a name=243:9></a> How blessedly must a disclosure like this have strengthened Isaiah for the Lord's service in that evil day!<a name=243:10></a> Nothing places one so superior to anything as having knowledge of the issue.<a name=243:11></a> It is not acquaintance with what exists that helps one, but he who has the secret of the result holds the key of the position.<a name=243:12></a> With this key Isaiah is entrusted, and every servant of God fitted by Him to stand in an evil day is in the Lord's mercy similarly qualified.<a name=243:13></a> He is not only instructed as to the final blessing of the people, but the judgment that must fall on them, because of their evil, is also communicated to him.<a name=243:14></a> The grace of God as well as His righteousness is shewn out more fully by the wickedness of man.<a name=243:15></a>

		In chapters 13 and 14, down to verse 27, the rise and fall of Babylon are presented to the prophet.<a name=244:7></a> It is worthy of note that at this time, historically, Babylon was a very insignificant place; but the Spirit of God instructs His servant as to His own estimate of Babylon, and the evil principles it had given birth to, and not according to man's judgment.<a name=244:8></a> I think we should gather from the manner and order of the Lord's teaching the truth which qualified a servant of God for the times and circumstances in which he was placed.<a name=244:9></a>

		See the immense amount of truth communicated to the prophet Isaiah before he was called to any service, but he was not told the nature of the particular service for which he was being prepared.<a name=248:11></a> Abram was not told that Melchisedec's visit and blessing were to prepare him for the interview with, and offers of, the king of Sodom; but he was so well prepared by it that he was enabled positively to refuse everything from him, from a thread to a shoe-latchet.<a name=248:12></a>

		Moses is another example.<a name=249:1></a> He was detained forty days in the glory, primarily to learn the true and full form and appearance of the tabernacle, and also to get morally fitted for the great service he would be called to in consequence of Israel's idolatry; so that when he comes down and sees the apostasy of the people, however great and terrible the surprise was to him, he, without any confusion or hesitation, knows how to act; he is neither afraid of man, nor doubtful with God; he is prepared for the crisis, and perfectly assured in heart; he acts according to God, and takes the tabernacle and pitches it without the camp, afar off from the camp, apart from all the idolatries of the apostate people.<a name=249:2></a> Thus also was the apostle Paul prepared for service, and to be, as the Lord says to him, "A minister and a witness both of the things which thou host seen and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee".<a name=249:3></a> Even in the case of the vision shewn to Peter (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10">Acts  10</a>) he is impressed more with the mind and counsel of God than with any particular form of expression which he was to use to Cornelius.<a name=249:4></a> When truly and fully imbued with the mind of God, the manner and way of giving it out is in keeping with His mind.<a name=249:5></a>

		Isaiah, having been subjected to this great sorrow, having practically entered into this tunnel, so necessary for every servant, in order really and in any measure fully to appreciate resurrection, is eventually enabled to tell Hezekiah the remedy to use in order that he might recover; chapter 38: 21.<a name=250:10></a> Thus when all hope is over, when the cold hand of death withers up everything, then breaks in a light to the darkness.<a name=250:11></a> Then deep conviction is wrought in the soul that there is a God that raiseth the dead.<a name=250:12></a> This was, to the heart of Isaiah, a real vision of his people.<a name=250:13></a> They were to die, to be cut off, as they now dispensationally are, and yet surely there will be a reviving of them again.<a name=250:14></a> Israel shall be restored.<a name=250:15></a>

		In the saddest and most eventful period of Israel's history Jeremiah was called to serve, and there is much in his history to be learned as to the character of vessel which the Lord uses in such a time, and the peculiar way in which He fits it for the mission assigned to it.<a name=252:8></a>

		Jeremiah was of the priests of Anathoth of Benjamin; he was by birth and association connected with, we may say, the hierarchy of the time; and he is called to testify against what had been so near and dear to him.<a name=252:9></a> God chooses His own instruments, and it is evident that He pre-arranges everything concerning them, so that the whole

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord consequently confers a gift on Jeremiah.<a name=253:12></a> He put forth His hand and touched his mouth, "And the Lord said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth".<a name=253:13></a> Thus he gets his commission -- a most important epoch in a servant's history, just as was the gift to Timothy by the laying on of the hands of the presbytery; he gets the sense, that not only is he sent into this world as a light, but the definite nature of his service is communicated to him.<a name=253:14></a> So Jeremiah receives in figure a revelation from the Lord in relation to the nature and line of his ministry.<a name=253:15></a> It is interesting to note the peculiar and distinct way in which every servant is fitted or commissioned for his work.<a name=253:16></a> Here by two emblems Jeremiah is furnished with a divine base for his work -- by the almond rod, which set forth that the

		It is one of the finest traits in a servant's character to be acted on by the word of the Lord in the fullest and deepest way in which it ought to act on those whom it concerns.<a name=254:14></a> No discipline is more valuable to a servant, than that he should personally enter into the meaning and force of the mind of the Lord which he is called to communicate, and feel it as the Lord would have his hearers to be affected by it.<a name=254:15></a>

		Then again, in chapter 10: 19 to end, he rather personates the repentant people.<a name=254:16></a> In the former chapters it is more his grief and dismay at the judgments of the Lord; here it is more the language and experience of one suffering under judgment.<a name=254:17></a>

		Now in the end of chapter 11 he is subjected to another experience.<a name=255:1></a> It is not now sorrow of heart because of the state of Israel, nor a sense of being under the judgment of God; it is now persecution, "I was like a lamb or an ox brought to the slaughter", so much so that he is made to feel the righteousness of the judgment upon them, and cries, "Let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I revealed my cause".<a name=255:2></a> This was persecution and of the bitterest kind, because it comes from his own people.<a name=255:3></a> Hence, "Thus saith the Lord of the men of Anathoth (his own country), that seek thy life, saying, Prophesy not in the name of the Lord, that thou die not by our hand: therefore, thus saith the Lord of hosts, Behold, I will punish them".<a name=255:4></a> It is very peculiar and interesting, the exercise the soul of the prophet passes through in connection with this persecution.<a name=255:5></a> It is not the ordinary persecution from the outwardly profane world, but his own people will not have him, but threaten him with death.<a name=255:6></a> It is the worst kind of persecution and that which marks this day.<a name=255:7></a> The most inveterate persecution of the hour is that which the faithful servant of God encounters now from "the men of Anathoth".<a name=255:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The meditations of Jeremiah consequent on this are in the beginning of chapter 12 to verse 4.<a name=255:9></a> In verses 5 and 6 be is admonished not to be surprised and overcome, for he is not to expect anything else.<a name=255:10></a> And then to verse 11 he is told the Lord's feelings respecting His heritage, but also His mercy if they repent.<a name=255:11></a>

		I dwell on this part of the prophet's discipline because it is so like much that the servant of the Lord has to pass through in this day.<a name=255:12></a> No servant is fitted for the Lord's work but as he passes through exercise, not only as to how he feels things, but how they are in the mind of the Lord.<a name=255:13></a>

		The peculiar power of a man of God -- a true servant -- is that he is not a mere channel like a gas pipe, but he can impart, in measure at least, the feelings of his Master, the words of which are given him.<a name=256:11></a> Surely it is this which gives power and effect to an evangelist.<a name=256:12></a> His heart is touched with the love of God to sinners; his conception of it may be small, but it is real; and according as it sensibly affects him, so is he qualified for his service.<a name=256:13></a>

		It is a deeply anxious and suffering moment with the prophet when he has to announce the break-up of all that bears the name of the Lord upon the earth.<a name=259:8></a> Jeremiah is required to do so in a very plain significant manner; he is desired to go and get a potter's earthen bottle, and take of the ancients of the people, and of the ancients of the priests, and go into the valley of the son of Hinnom, and proclaim there the words that I shall tell thee.<a name=259:9></a> "And thou shalt break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with thee, and shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord; Even so will I break this people, and this city, as one breaketh a potter's vessel, that cannot be made whole again; and they shall bury them in Tophet, till there be no place to bury.<a name=259:10></a> Thus will I do unto this place, saith the Lord".<a name=259:11></a>

		There is something singularly effective in this act of the prophet.<a name=260:1></a> No one could mistake the meaning of the terrible announcement; the simplicity and distinctness in the mode of announcing it, and the unpopular, exclusive position in which it placed the prophet, draw largely upon one's sympathies, as depicting the sufferings of the faithful servant, within the circle of God's people, where every disparagement affects him in a twofold way: one, as reflecting on his service, indicating lack in it, and the other more naturally, because they were so closely related to himself.<a name=260:2></a> How often has a servant, when unable to bear the tax on his patience by the perverseness of those within, turned to a more outward service and occupied himself more with evangelical work.<a name=260:3></a> A man's greatness in every virtue is most tried, and therefore best displayed where he is most at home, or rather where every one may, with most freedom, act independently of him.<a name=260:4></a> The man that is proof to the petty and constant demands on his temper and grace in private life, in the circle where every one is most at home with him, is well able for every other.<a name=260:5></a>

		It is not merely the bodily suffering which so afflicts a servant of God under persecution, it is the sense of the triumph of wrong over right, he being subjected to reproach undeservedly.<a name=260:9></a> Nothing is so afflicting as injustice.<a name=260:10></a> There is hardly any one, even down to the youngest child, who is not wounded, often incurably, by unjust punishment.<a name=260:11></a> "They rewarded me evil for good", was one of the deep sufferings of our Lord, and the higher and the greater the good, the more does evil afflict.<a name=260:12></a> Thus we are told two things respecting Jeremiah; one, how the Lord will avenge him and punish Pashur.<a name=260:13></a> Woe unto any one who persecutes or injures the man of God.<a name=260:14></a> "Cursed be he that curseth thee".<a name=260:15></a> The Lord will reward him according

		Hence, in the next chapter (21) Zedekiah sends to Jeremiah to inquire what is the mind of the Lord about the war that Nebuchadnezzar waged against him.<a name=261:10></a> He is now acknowledged as a prophet of the Lord; he was humbled, he is now exalted, and he can announce the nature of the siege, and the only true way to escape from it.<a name=261:11></a> Great and wondrous privilege for the true servant of God!<a name=261:12></a> And what vicissitudes he has to pass through!<a name=261:13></a> At one time, cast down and an object of reproach and ridicule: and at another, waited on as the only expositor of the mind of the Lord.<a name=261:14></a>

		It is a most trying, anxious moment, when a servant is opposed by a false teacher who commands the sympathies of the people, who with arrogant assumption panders to their carnal hopes, so that the servant of the Lord is reduced to the most isolated position toward those whom he would serve in his testimony.<a name=264:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From verse 6 to verse 9 Jeremiah states the test of a true prophet of peace.<a name=264:7></a> But when Hananiah took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck, and brake it, and said in presence of all the people, "Thus saith the Lord; Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years;" then the prophet Jeremiah went his way.<a name=264:8></a> It is always wise to accept the lowest place, even in the Lord's service, and to be as the one beaten, just as Jeremiah here retires in silence.<a name=264:9></a>

		There are two great things peculiar to the mystery: one is that we all -- Jew and Gentile -- are raised together and made to sit together in heavenly places in Christ; the first thing is that we are heavenly; and the second is, that in the same power which raised Christ up we are raised up.<a name=301:9></a> That is a power entirely outside and beyond everything of man; and consequently on this, or resulting from it, there should be, because of this power working <i>in</i> us, a

		growing up to Him, the Head in all things; and this with absolute and decided victory over all the power of the devil, so that it is not merely the height to which we are raised out of all here, but the immense moral superiority in which we are placed here on earth, the place of our alienation from God.<a name=302:1></a> Brought to the greatest height (heaven) by the greatest power, the power which raised Christ, and because we are heavenly, competent to be descriptive here of Christ, from the highest circle -- the assembly, down to a slave, and at the same time superior to the wiles and the power of the devil.<a name=302:2></a> How entranced the apostle must have been as all this by the Spirit came by inspired words before him.<a name=302:3></a> Surely he justified God for all the discipline to which he had been subjected in order to make him a vessel fit to impart the greatest communication ever made to a man.<a name=302:4></a> We little understand all the pains, as I might say, which the Lord takes with us to render us in any measure suited for His work.<a name=302:5></a> He only knows what is fitting, and that this fitness could not be procured by any other means but by the discipline which He who knows behind and before administers.<a name=302:6></a> It is most touching to hear the apostle writing "to make all men see the economy of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God;" and in which the angels now learn the manifold wisdom of God; <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:9">Ephesians  3:9</a>, 10.<a name=302:7></a> "And to make all men see what is the administration of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ: to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God".<a name=302:8></a>

		The remainder of the apostle's life seems to have been divided into two parts: one, in which he was led into the height and blessedness of the mystery, and his own experience as entering into it as detailed in Philippians; and the other, the terrible declension (2 Timothy); how he was deserted, as we find in chapter 4, and how he helps us in such a time.<a name=302:9></a>

		It is very interesting and helpful that we have in the Epistle to the Philippians the experiences of the apostle at this time.<a name=303:1></a> There are, as it seems to me, two parts: the first, the beginning of his imprisonment, when he was enjoying the blessed results of God's calling, as described in Ephesians; while at the close, when the departure from the truth was almost overwhelming, when all in Asia had turned away from him, he was peculiarly supported and cheered by the Lord, and thus a guide to us.<a name=303:2></a> Each is of deep interest to us.<a name=303:3></a> The one to shew us the sublime happiness which is ours in the most trying circumstances, The prisoner at Rome not only sees and writes of things of infinite magnitude, but he tells us also (led to do so by the Spirit) his own experiences at the time.<a name=303:4></a> In <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#1">Philippians  1</a>, "To be with Christ, which is far better", is the first desire of his heart; but as it is good for the saints that he should remain, he knows that he will remain; but his expectation now, as always, is that Christ should be magnified in his body by life or by death.<a name=303:5></a>

		In chapter 3 Christ is his object; he surrenders all that was naturally of gain to him for Christ, and forgets the things which are behind, pressing on to the goal -- the high calling of God in Christ Jesus; a citizen of heaven, looking for Him to come to change this body of humiliation into a glorious body like Christ's own glorious body.<a name=303:8></a> And finally, in chapter 4, he has learned that in whatever state he is to be satisfied in himself, and he can do all things through Him who strengtheneth him.<a name=303:9></a> Thus his desire is -- First, to be with Christ; secondly, to be a servant like Him; thirdly, Christ is his sole exclusive object; and lastly, Christ is the power to carry him over everything here.<a name=303:10></a> These four great experiences are generated from the two sides of the calling.<a name=303:11></a>

		It unfolds to us his inner life, and how he, a prisoner, was pleading for the blessing of souls, and how he was led of the Lord to expose the beginning of a leaven which has permeated the church everywhere; and at the same time to set forth the blessed and only way by which they could be preserved from it.<a name=304:1></a> It is very encouraging to place oneself as it were beside the apostle in his chains, and apprehend in some degree the deep conflict through which he was passing in order that the saints might be preserved from this great leaven -- a compound of religiousness and mentality.<a name=304:2></a> What a contrast are his life and times with the Lord (so blessed and so bright) with his circumstances in the eyes of men!<a name=304:3></a> Most blessed to know that holding the Head -- Christ everything and in all -- clears and preserves us from all this leaven.<a name=304:4></a>

		THE SECOND PART.

	<div class="paragraph">
		The close of his imprisonment discloses to us a very different state of things from that at the beginning of his imprisonment.<a name=304:5></a> It is thought by some that 1 Timothy was written after the first imprisonment, and there is much to corroborate this view; but it is very evident that there is a very marked change between 1st and 2nd Timothy.<a name=304:6></a> In the former the apostle is occupied with order, writing to Timothy at Ephesus; and in the latter he is occupied with disorder, and how the man of God should behave in such a time.<a name=304:7></a> It is to be remarked that in the first epistle, in connection with the proper ordering of the assembly, he sets forth the two great evils which were impending, namely, Romanism in chapter 4, and radicalism in chapter 6; or Christianity without Christ -- religion with independence of God on the one hand, while on the other, gain was godliness or whatever exalted man.<a name=304:8></a> One was exalting man under the form of the christian religion, the other making human advancement everything.<a name=304:9></a>

		at the close of Paul's second imprisonment, we see the apostle in quite different times from those at the beginning of his first imprisonment, when he wrote, "I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel", <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#1:12">Philippians  1:12</a>.<a name=305:1></a> This epistle (2 Timothy) was written after his first answer (chapter 4: 16), when none of the saints stood with him.<a name=305:2></a> He begins by saying, "God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind;" and in the same chapter announces "that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes".<a name=305:3></a> When we bear in mind that Asia was the country where he had chiefly laboured, we can form some idea of the grief and distress which their alienation must have given him.<a name=305:4></a> How touchingly his heart clings to even one there, as he writes, "The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus".<a name=305:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But Paul is not discouraged.<a name=305:6></a> If in the Epistle to the Ephesians he led us to the glorious heights of God's calling, so now, when disaffection and the utmost obstruction prevailed in the assembly, he having unfolded to us its glory with God, is now the one to support and to guide us in the direst confusion, when "instead of a girdle there is a rent, and burning instead of beauty".<a name=305:7></a> (See <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#3:24">Isaiah  3:24</a>.<a name=305:8></a>) In a few sentences pregnant with divine blessing he instructs Timothy and through him all who would be faithful to Christ what is to be done at such a time.<a name=305:9></a> His instructions may be classed under two heads: one, that being strong himself in the grace that is in Christ Jesus, Timothy was to commit the things that he had heard from the apostle "to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also;" the other, that he was to be most absolute in his separation from the vessels to dishonour.<a name=305:10></a> "If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work", chapter 2: 21.<a name=305:11></a>

		Our apostle having prepared us for the last days, intimates that his course is finished.<a name=306:8></a> He says, "I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.<a name=306:9></a> I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing" (chapter 4: 6 - 8); a blessed finish to his great service.<a name=306:10></a> And then in the calmness and confidence of one perfectly subject to the will of God, he can think of having the profit of Timothy's company: "Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me".<a name=306:11></a> Also, "Take Mark and bring him with thee".<a name=306:12></a>
