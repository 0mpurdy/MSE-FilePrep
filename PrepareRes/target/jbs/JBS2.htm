	<div class="paragraph">
		My thought in coming to a meeting like this, is to hear something from the Lord that will help me on in relation to this present time; call it a conference if you like - we <i>do</i> come together to confer with each other - to hear each other speak.<a name=1:1></a> It is that I may know His mind, which is a distinct thing.<a name=1:2></a> "I call you not servants .<a name=1:3></a>.<a name=1:4></a>.<a name=1:5></a> but .<a name=1:6></a>.<a name=1:7></a> .<a name=1:8></a> <i>friends</i> "; (<a href="../bible/John.htm#15:15">John  15:15</a>) the servant does not know what his Lord doeth.<a name=1:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now no amount of valour will give you the mind of the Lord.<a name=1:10></a> The ten thousand who followed Gideon did not know his mind; it was only the three hundred who did; it was not until the nine thousand and seven hundred had gone back that he said, "As I do so shall ye do".<a name=1:11></a> (<a href="../bible/Judges.htm#7:17">Judges  7:17</a>) The order of battle is only given to those who prove that they prefer the glory of the Lord to any favour or mercies that can be granted to them here on earth.<a name=1:12></a> Many a valiant man I have seen turned aside by a favour given to him here: in Luke it was those who had received favours who begged to be excused from the Supper.<a name=1:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I have on my mind at this present moment to bring out is the support that we derive from One in heaven; we do not get support from anything here, we only get it from the One there.<a name=1:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now not only have you <i>title</i> to heaven, but you are in <i>possession</i> of heaven now whilst you are on earth.<a name=1:15></a> I make a distinction between possession in life and practical possession.<a name=1:16></a> You have possession in life, but you are only true to your life when you have <i>practical</i> possession of it.<a name=1:17></a> And let me tell you there are many in possession in life who know nothing of this.<a name=1:18></a> It is not a question whether my life really <i>be</i> there, but it is quite another thing whether I am <i>living</i> there.<a name=1:19></a> And,

		it is the person who has apprehended most of the portion given to him of God in Christ, who has the most trembling anxiety as to how much he is really practically in possession of that of which he is actually in possession in life.<a name=2:1></a> It is no light matter to me to have the transcending power of an eternal God to do with.<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In connection with Stephen we have three distinct subjects brought out, the first being what I will now speak upon; that is, what is our true spring and fountain of support while we are upon this earth.<a name=2:3></a> It does not always begin with this, but Scripture has opened it out to us thus here - there are other ways of looking at it of course.<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing we start with, and that is the practical difficulty, is that we learn that we are united to Christ, and that He introduces us into a scene where there is no cloud at all - into a sphere where there is no disturbance; a new day is inaugurated.<a name=2:5></a> The new creation of God has commenced.<a name=2:6></a> In the old creation God began with making the heavens and the earth - the earth, the trees, the animals, and ended with the man.<a name=2:7></a> The new creation has begun in the reverse direction; it begins with a Man, the Son of the Father - He is the beginning of the creation of God - and it will wind up with the new heavens and the new earth.<a name=2:8></a> And what the church will give up is this beginning of the creation of God; it will be spued out of His mouth because it does not maintain it.<a name=2:9></a> Laodicea would be very glad to have the <i>virtues</i> of Christ, but it will not have the Author of them; in fact that is what <i>infidelity</i> even would have - the apples without the apple tree.<a name=2:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I speak now of all of us as being introduced into this new thing, and He coming in and saying to us: "Peace be unto you".<a name=2:11></a> (<a href="../bible/John.htm#20:26">John  20:26</a>) This ought not to require to be repeated; if He does repeat it, it is but to say the very same words again - there are no others - it is: "Peace be unto you".<a name=2:12></a> True there is another peace

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		connected with going through this scene, but <i>here</i> you have to do with this risen Man.<a name=3:1></a> It is like a body in an exhausted cylinder; it goes up, and up, and up; you get right away up without a single check!<a name=3:2></a> - I say that is practically the difference between this peace and the peace on the way; it is not "a <i>rugged hill</i> that reaches up to God"; it is a <i>rugged race</i> down here.<a name=3:3></a> There are not any clouds - not if you know what it is to be connected with Christ there; union with Christ connects you with a new order of things, where there is not a cloud - where all is perfectly bright!<a name=3:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He comes into their midst to proclaim that character of thing.<a name=3:5></a> Therefore it says, "The <i>Lord</i> .<a name=3:6></a>.<a name=3:7></a>.<a name=3:8></a> hath triumphed gloriously" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15:1">Exodus  15:1</a>) - not <i>I</i>; for <i>He</i> fought the battle, and <i>His</i> victory is mine.<a name=3:9></a> How high do you see Christ?<a name=3:10></a> At the right hand of God.<a name=3:11></a> I place that point before you again, because there is no going on until you have it.<a name=3:12></a> I might have to do with that blessed One risen out of everything.<a name=3:13></a> "If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.<a name=3:14></a> Set your affection on things above".<a name=3:15></a> (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3:1">Colossians  3:1</a>) There is the importance of it.<a name=3:16></a> I say to any soul here who has a cloud: You have never yet seen Christ as the One who has cleared off everything, as the One who has risen out of it all.<a name=3:17></a> He is out of it so I am out of it.<a name=3:18></a> Like the island that rose out of the Mediterranean years ago, just so have I risen out of everything.<a name=3:19></a> However high up you see Christ, I am there, for His victory is my victory.<a name=3:20></a> You have to connect yourself with the One who loved you, and who gave Himself for you, and who says, "Peace be unto you".<a name=3:21></a> (<a href="../bible/John.htm#20:26">John  20:26</a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Stephen already knew what it was to have possession of heaven in life; we find he is looking up into heaven.<a name=3:22></a> The fact of the place was not brought in yet, for in the first chapter of Acts, they were told <i>not</i> to gaze into heaven.<a name=3:23></a> But now we know that the One who was
	</div>

		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		refused life here, died for us that we might have life there.<a name=4:1></a> Man refused Him life here, and God, in His grace, turned man's rejection into his blessing.<a name=4:2></a> We partake of His life; man refused Him a place here; and God has given Him a place in heaven; and we are raised up with Him, and made to sit together in heavenly places in Christ.<a name=4:3></a> We have not only got <i>life</i> in His Son but we have got a <i>place</i>.<a name=4:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This the Lord is putting before us in the fourteenth of John.<a name=4:5></a> He deals with our conscience in the thirteenth, with our heart in the fourteenth.<a name=4:6></a> He says, Now do not let your hearts be troubled; you must follow Me by faith.<a name=4:7></a> What is faith?<a name=4:8></a> Close your eye to everything visible, and open your ear to God.<a name=4:9></a> That is faith.<a name=4:10></a> I now by faith see that which is invisible; I have to do with that blessed One gone to the Father to prepare a place for me.<a name=4:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What is brought out in Stephen is that he is practically one who realises this.<a name=4:12></a> Though he was not like Paul seated in heaven, yet he knew the support that we derive on earth from One in heaven; he had no support here.<a name=4:13></a> The Bridegroom being taken away, there is nothing to engage the heart, so you may fast.<a name=4:14></a> I am bold to say every one who knows Christ really as the One up there, however much he may love the communion of saints, would far sooner have a time alone with the Lord.<a name=4:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now it is not only that all the <i>bad</i> is against you, but that the <i>good</i> is against you.<a name=4:16></a> Pull up your blind in the morning and say: Well, I know that there is not a single thing in this world for me; it is all against me - even all that claims to be commendable to the human eye.<a name=4:17></a> I often think what an insignificant person I should appear on the platform of Exeter Hall, if I came in after all the wonderful accounts of what such a missionary society is doing in one place, and such another in some other, if I stood up and said: He sups with me, and I with Him.<a name=4:18></a> What Stephen finds
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		all round him is the wickedness of the religious world.<a name=5:1></a> He takes the place for God on earth; he stands before those religious functionaries coming out in all their enmity against God's servant.<a name=5:2></a> And what does he say?<a name=5:3></a> - Why, I get nothing here.<a name=5:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This world is just going on to its consummation, and heaven is opened to me.<a name=5:5></a> It never was opened till now, but now it is opened by the Holy Spirit.<a name=5:6></a> You are united to Christ even before you know your property, so to say.<a name=5:7></a> One side is that I am sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise; and the other is that He is the earnest of the inheritance.<a name=5:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here Stephen, being full of the Holy Spirit, looked up steadfastly into heaven.<a name=5:9></a> The Lord when going away from His disciples had told them in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>, "I go to prepare a place for you".<a name=5:10></a> Now I am not here gone into heaven, but I am looking at the One in heaven.<a name=5:11></a> Some have a physical fear of death.<a name=5:12></a> If you have, be sure you are occupied with death, and not with the Person of Christ; you are looking at the water instead of at the ark of the covenant.<a name=5:13></a> In Jordan there is not a single thing to pass through; there is not a drop of water to be seen at all - not a single thing to bar my entrance into the land.<a name=5:14></a> True, I have practically to pass through a tunnel here; I do not want to hide it from you; you have to throw all this scene into darkness that you may have the light on the other side.<a name=5:15></a> I am as confident about it as of anything, through His grace, that you never can find Christ but through death.<a name=5:16></a> He was refused life here; the sun must go down then.<a name=5:17></a> He was known to them in the breaking of bread - the figure of death.<a name=5:18></a> Christ will not appear but at night.<a name=5:19></a> I must find it all a scene in which the light has gone out; and then what brings in its beautiful light to me?<a name=5:20></a> The morning star!<a name=5:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, it <i>is</i> night.<a name=5:22></a> The sun <i>has</i> gone down.<a name=5:23></a> So many people think they can have Christ in the enjoyment of circumstances here, but I do not believe it.<a name=5:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=6>[Page 6]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Many think He will give them happy circumstances here.<a name=6:1></a> I used to; and then I used to be thoroughly disappointed at the way in which God refused to do things for me that I expected He would do.<a name=6:2></a> But I never am disappointed now; indeed I am now perfectly surprised that He ever should do <i>anything</i> for me, instead of being disappointed that He does not do more.<a name=6:3></a> True, there is nothing in this world which He would not do for me.<a name=6:4></a> He would give me a fine day: "He that spared not his own Son, .<a name=6:5></a>.<a name=6:6></a> .<a name=6:7></a> shall he not with him also freely give us <i>all</i> things?<a name=6:8></a>" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:32">Romans  8:32</a>) But then look at the other side: "For thy sake we are killed all the day long" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:36">Romans  8:36</a>); that is <i>your</i> side; the fellowship of His sufferings.<a name=6:9></a> There is no end to his love, but where do I find it?<a name=6:10></a> <i>In the scene where He is Himself</i>.<a name=6:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"For thy sake we are killed all the day long".<a name=6:12></a> (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:36">Romans  8:36</a>) That is where Stephen is, and that is my proper place.<a name=6:13></a> But I cannot take it, I cannot bear it, unless I know what it is to have a bright scene outside it all.<a name=6:14></a> I have to do with a Person who is not here, and thus I am in the wilderness.<a name=6:15></a> And I would just say that the wilderness is not a <i>place</i>; it is a <i>bridge</i>, and not a "bridge of sighs", but a bridge of hope, over which I pass from Egypt into Canaan.<a name=6:16></a> I go on to possess the land; but possession in practice implies immense suffering.<a name=6:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two things that mark the wilderness: the one, to acquire the Man who is <i>not</i> here; the other, to resist the man who <i>is</i> here.<a name=6:18></a> There is the daily picking up of the manna, the stooping for it; you must make yourself small if you want to pick up Christ.<a name=6:19></a> The food of the wilderness comes down from heaven, but you must be little enough to pick it up.<a name=6:20></a> It had to be gathered every morning before the sun was up.<a name=6:21></a> Now let no one reduce that to mere prayer, and the reading of a chapter the first thing in the morning.<a name=6:22></a> Manna is the wonderful sense of the sufficiency of Christ for every exigency of the day that I may be

		called to go through.<a name=7:1></a> I have to do with Him where He is, as I go on here day by day.<a name=7:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Stephen looks up steadfastly into heaven and sees the glory of God and Jesus; and, now that all is settled there, he comes back to his place here, but he changes the words.<a name=7:3></a> He says, "I see .<a name=7:4></a>.<a name=7:5></a>.<a name=7:6></a> the <i>Son of man</i> standing on the right hand of God" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7:56">Acts  7:56</a>); He does not say <i>Jesus</i> .<a name=7:7></a> Jesus is that peculiar familiar name - that name of endearment - which ought never to be spoken but from heart to heart, and not breathed to the common ear.<a name=7:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And now they cry out with a loud voice, and stop their ears, and run upon him, and he derives power from Christ to act like Him.<a name=7:9></a> I believe you derive power from Christ suited to the circumstances you are in, when you are occupied with Him.<a name=7:10></a> People are occupied with the thing before them, instead of with the One who can deliver them out of it.<a name=7:11></a> I often bring forward as an illustration of this the story of a woman in a ship in a storm; she was asked what she was thinking of in the storm, and she answered that she was thinking of how Jesus acted when He was in the storm.<a name=7:12></a> Now, if she had been thinking of Him where He <i>is</i>, it would have made her act like Him when he was in the storm.<a name=7:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The man who is making an effort to go over a fence certainly is not over it.<a name=7:14></a> No man ever lost his temper yet but from impotence; a man who loses his temper proves that his ardour is greater than his ability.<a name=7:15></a> If he can say, Oh!<a name=7:16></a> I am quite up to that, he will never lose his temper over it.<a name=7:17></a> If your ability is up to your ardour you will be quiet.<a name=7:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now here we get a man entirely superior to himself and this is the character of the Holy Spirit's acting.<a name=7:19></a> Stephen has come back to this scene, and I get this wonderful fact in connection with him: that when everything had come to its climax, when they set themselves to refuse the One whom he offered to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		them, Stephen was not only superior to it all, but able to act for others in the midst of it; and this is the place of God's people upon the earth.<a name=8:1></a> What do you find in him?<a name=8:2></a> He is calm.<a name=8:3></a> Is it that he is able to resist it all as the rock resists the dashing of the waves?<a name=8:4></a> Not at all!<a name=8:5></a> He is not only calm, he is active.<a name=8:6></a> And, not as one has said, to "Wake and find him gone" - not as in the Canticles the bride awakes to realise the stupendous sense of what it is to be without the companion of her heart.<a name=8:7></a> But what says the psalmist?<a name=8:8></a> "I laid me down and slept; I awaked, for the Lord sustained me".<a name=8:9></a> (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#3:5">Psalm  3:5</a>) So Stephen was able to come out in divine activity to the very men who caused his death; he comes out as intercessor for them; and, for my own part, I believe that Saul of Tarsus was the answer to his prayers.<a name=8:10></a> He came out and showed what a man could be <i>from</i> heaven, not only what a man was going <i>to</i> heaven.<a name=8:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I read it, and I am abashed when I do.<a name=8:12></a> Why should my spirit be put out by such a little trifle?<a name=8:13></a> In the power of the Holy Spirit I can be superior to every character of violence - to every order of suffering.<a name=8:14></a> I look to it the day is coming when we shall be tested.<a name=8:15></a> I do not look for outside persecution, but I look for internal persecution.<a name=8:16></a> Why, if I were only walking faithfully, I should be tabooed by my brethren.<a name=8:17></a> There never was such a marvellous thing!<a name=8:18></a> While such a trifle as a hot room will sometimes quite upset me, and put me all astray, here is a man who is superior to everything.<a name=8:19></a> He says, I give my spirit to that Man there, for the man here is taking my life away.<a name=8:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is nothing for me to enjoy but heaven.<a name=8:21></a> Well then, I say, I ought to enjoy it.<a name=8:22></a> I have to run a race, but my Gideon is before me in it, and He says, "As I do, so shall ye do".<a name=8:23></a> I have the most unbounded scene that ever could be known to the heart; I am to God in an ecstasy; I am in unqualified possession of it as to life, and would to God I knew more of it

	<div class="paragraph">
		There are only two things you have to learn, and how many do not accept them!<a name=9:7></a> One is, you are <i>not</i> to have the man here and the place, where <i>he</i> is; the other is, you <i>are</i> to have another Man, and the place where <i>He</i> is.<a name=9:8></a> What, am I not to have a little bit of earth?<a name=9:9></a> - No, not a bit!<a name=9:10></a> That is just what you get in the fourteenth of Luke.<a name=9:11></a> Those who had the blessings of the earth all with one consent began to make excuse; it is: "I pray thee, have me excused".<a name=9:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Stephen says to them: The Lord Jesus Christ in glory has come down and offers Himself to take a throne here; do you refuse that Man who has come down from above?<a name=9:13></a> - But they stopped their ears and ran upon him with one accord, and cast him out of the city and stoned him.<a name=9:14></a> And he knelt down and prayed for them; I do not believe he prayed for himself; it was: "lay not this sin to their charge.<a name=9:15></a> And when he had said this, he fell asleep.<a name=9:16></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus you see what a thing it is to bring Christ into real daily life.<a name=9:17></a> The general thought of every believer is to get the Lord to help him on in the things here where he is; he wants the human side of it.<a name=9:18></a> But you must begin upon an entirely new basis.<a name=9:19></a> I am the same tree that I was before my conversion, but there is a new kind of sap in the tree, and that sap refuses to work in wrong connections; all the wrong connections must be withered.<a name=9:20></a> I take you upon the ground of being dead; timber is of no use until it is dead.<a name=9:21></a> Are you a father?<a name=9:22></a> - Well, says the Lord, I sanction that

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord grant to us, beloved friends, to understand what has been before us.<a name=10:11></a> May he lead our hearts to understand how practical and how blessed a thing it is to know, that, though "this world is a wilderness wide", I have got a Man in heaven above it all, whose resources flow down to me here.<a name=10:12></a> The action of the Holy Spirit leads me to Him; that is His upward action; it is: "seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God".<a name=10:13></a> I find a great many saints will go in a measure as far as Stephen, but they will not go any farther; they will look <i>up</i> to heaven, but they will not go <i>in</i>.<a name=10:14></a> The grand difficulty for the heart is to change the place.<a name=10:15></a> <i>This</i> is only a place to have a tomb in.<a name=10:16></a> As Abraham says, I have no place here but a tomb.<a name=10:17></a> As a baptised person I take the ground of being a buried man; and, as in some countries they raise cairns over the graves, so with me; every man who goes by and throws a stone upon me is only raising the cairn!<a name=10:18></a> I am a gone man.<a name=10:19></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This chapter describes the action that was to take place consequent upon the people reaching what was the purpose of God.<a name=12:1></a> I turn back to the third of Exodus to see what that purpose was, and read at the seventh verse: "And the Lord said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows; and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey".<a name=12:2></a> That is the purpose of God.<a name=12:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this purpose, beloved friends, we cannot keep it too simply before our hearts.<a name=12:4></a> I find that He has a purpose about me, and that it is this: to bring me out of one place into another place.<a name=12:5></a> The prodigal's place is in the Father's house though, as to himself, he may not have come upstairs yet; and that is the case with many saints.<a name=12:6></a> I may not have reached it yet, but I know the desire in my Father's heart about me.<a name=12:7></a>

		Saints make their necessity the measure of God's action for them.<a name=12:8></a> It is true that my necessity is met; but it is never the measure of God's action for me.<a name=12:9></a> If we make our necessity the measure, we never get beyond it.<a name=12:10></a> God never gives us anything that we do not value.<a name=12:11></a> Everyone in this room has what he values.<a name=12:12></a> He may think that he has not; he may think that he values more than he has; but the fact that he does not is shown by his not possessing it.<a name=12:13></a> God says you do not value more, therefore I do not give you more.<a name=12:14></a> He does not cast His pearls before swine; it is according to the amount of interest that you take in it that you have it; according to your appreciation of the

	<div class="paragraph">
		Nothing is more manifest than that God's purpose is to have me in this spot.<a name=13:2></a> Your Father in heaven has a spot for you; a spot that it is His desire you should occupy; and your occupying it will alone satisfy His heart.<a name=13:3></a> Your Father wishes you to be there: the love of the parent wants the child to be brought into the sphere where he himself is.<a name=13:4></a> You may occupy it or not, but, if you do not, you have never fulfilled His purpose.<a name=13:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The idea is beyond all human conception!<a name=13:6></a> My Father desires that I should occupy this place of nearness to Him.<a name=13:7></a> That such a thing as this should be made known to a poor heart like mine, is to me the climax of everything!<a name=13:8></a> it is irresistible!<a name=13:9></a> I may be below the mark, I may lose the idea, but that is what is in His heart; it is His ideal; and I wonder at myself, that I am so little moved by it.<a name=13:10></a> My Father has a spot for me, and the only question is whether I will occupy it.<a name=13:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, beloved, there is only One who ever could occupy the place of standing between God and me.<a name=13:12></a> Only One knew what the extent of my offence was, and only One knew what the love of the Father's heart was to me, a poor prodigal.<a name=13:13></a> Only One knew the extent of my offence against God, for I must be equal to a person to know how he feels about a thing; and none knows the love of the Father to me but that One; and He says, I bear the one, I declare the other; from sin and Satan I bear them every one, and I declare Thy name unto My brethren.<a name=13:14></a> He encounters everything in the twenty-second Psalm, and comes in after it all like the sun shining in his glory upon the scene.<a name=13:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not only that there is a purpose in my Father's heart about me, but His only beloved Son has accomplished that purpose for me.<a name=13:16></a> He has come forth to do all God's will, and, having done it, He has returned

		Yes, says the Lord Jesus, I have prepared it for you; there is a spot in the Father's house that is yours; you have title - indefeasible title to it; and, if you do not occupy it, nobody will; it will be unoccupied, that is all.<a name=14:4></a>

		You are not true to your life if you are not in the place where your life is.<a name=14:5></a> The "great supper", is not <i>salvation</i>, as the commentators say.<a name=14:6></a> Ask any child what a supper is; and he will tell you it is an entertainment.<a name=14:7></a> But no one knows anything about <i>entertainment</i>; they have no sense of anything of the kind.<a name=14:8></a> People talk of <i>deliverance</i>, but that is not <i>riches</i> .<a name=14:9></a> John's gospel comes in to supply that.<a name=14:10></a> There He talks about "the gift".<a name=14:11></a> He says, I will tell your poor heart what will satisfy you.<a name=14:12></a> He brings in the fourth chapter as a contrast to the second, and the saint who is not in the fourth has gone back to the second - to earthly joys, and earthly religion.<a name=14:13></a> In the second the wine is out, but in the fourth the Spirit is in.<a name=14:14></a> In the third, He died because of me that I might have life because of Him; and in the fourth there is a sufficiency of everything; you will never thirst, the Spirit is <i>in</i> you; you need never go outside yourself, for the Spirit of God in you springs up into everlasting life, and leads the heart practically into the knowledge of a scene where there is perfectness of blessing outside of everything here.<a name=14:15></a>

		place, a spot for me.<a name=15:1></a> "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him".<a name=15:2></a> It is <i>vague</i>, says Isaiah.<a name=15:3></a> Now that is the idea of many souls.<a name=15:4></a> I have often appealed to souls, and said, Have you any idea of what heaven will be?<a name=15:5></a> They have perhaps had some vague thoughts about it, and I have said, You have not got beyond Isaiah.<a name=15:6></a> In Corinthians we get the contrast to this: "God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit"; there is the accomplishment of the purpose.<a name=15:7></a> One has done it, and He says, I bring you into a new condition which entirely eclipses the old one.<a name=15:8></a> In the fourth chapter you are superior to the man who could not get on without wine; and you have yet another thing: you have not only that which is superior to the man, but in the seventh chapter, that which is superior to the earth; rivers of living water flow from you; you minister to the earth instead of its ministering to you.<a name=15:9></a> How am I made superior to all here?<a name=15:10></a> By the Holy Spirit.<a name=15:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All that I am stating now is in order to show that there is a spot in God's own mind for us; that He has a purpose that He has accomplished for us.<a name=15:12></a> In Isaiah we get that purpose, and in Corinthians the Spirit of God shows us that it is secured to us.<a name=15:13></a> So that first there is the purpose; second the accomplishment; and third what remains for us but to enjoy it?<a name=15:14></a> He says, "The Son of man must be lifted up"; and faith is simple when I turn away from my ruin, and when my eye is occupied with Himself.<a name=15:15></a> I want to give you the connection of the Spirit of God.<a name=15:16></a> If, as a believer, you are not walking in that new condition which the Spirit of God has opened up to you, you are going back to man and earth.<a name=15:17></a> What we have to learn is, that we have to do with a Man in heaven, and that we have to do with <i>the place where He is</i> .<a name=15:18></a> For, though we are united by the Spirit to that Man that is in

	<div class="paragraph">
		heaven, yet you have to go to heaven to enjoy the Man that is in heaven.<a name=16:1></a> I say that because I see practically how it works.<a name=16:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is the purpose of God first that He has that place for me, chosen by His love.<a name=16:3></a> I cannot tell how it draws me, that love!<a name=16:4></a> The Lord says, "I have meat to eat that ye know not of", "My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work".<a name=16:5></a> I used to read it, "finish <i>her</i> work", but it was <i>His</i> work.<a name=16:6></a> He says I have answered to the heart of the living God in what I have communicated to that poor woman.<a name=16:7></a> I heard a benefactor say once: "It is a nice thing to make anyone happy by giving them two pence!<a name=16:8></a>" Now that is a <i>benefactor</i> and nothing more.<a name=16:9></a> Christ was happy because He had done <i>God's</i> work.<a name=16:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The third thing is the enjoyment of this purpose, which can only be by the Spirit of God.<a name=16:11></a> Now I notice that people practise all sorts of deceptions upon themselves.<a name=16:12></a> I will just mention one of them.<a name=16:13></a> I hear a person say, "I have such sweet communion with Jesus"; and I am quite astonished when I come to talk with him, and inquire a little closer into what this sweet communion is, I find it is his sense of the compassion and interest that the Lord has shown to him in the trial he has been passing through.<a name=16:14></a> In fact it is Jesus sympathising with him - coming down in grace into his circumstances - it is sympathy, not communion.<a name=16:15></a> I do not know anything more injurious than calling low things by high names.<a name=16:16></a> For instance, people call prayer meetings worship meetings.<a name=16:17></a> A person coming to a meeting and getting his feet washed at it, will say, Oh, what a blessed season we have had!<a name=16:18></a> Well, it <i>is</i> a blessed season when you have the Lord dealing with you, but, if you have really met Himself, you will scarcely speak of it in that way.<a name=16:19></a> We use too many figurative expressions about our experiences, and lose an immense deal by not allowing the truth to come out in its reality to us.<a name=16:20></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Though united to Christ in heaven, there as your Head, yet you must also know what it is to be in the <i>place</i> where He is.<a name=17:1></a> What many want is to get the Lord down into their own circumstances; but you <i>must</i> find the Lord in the place where He is.<a name=17:2></a> Many want Him down here; and He does minister to my wants; He came down here purposely to meet death in a double way, therefore all the sympathy that I need I meet with from Him in my circumstances here.<a name=17:3></a> But besides that He says, "I go to prepare a <i>place</i> for you".<a name=17:4></a> The only thing that will satisfy my heart is being in company with the One who has won my heart; in order to enjoy a person you must be in the place where that person is.<a name=17:5></a> Now that is what this chapter in Deuteronomy is.<a name=17:6></a> You are come into the place, you are dwelling in it, and then you find out what a wonderful thing it is to be occupied with the Person who dwells there.<a name=17:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now let me turn for a moment to the epistle to the Ephesians.<a name=17:8></a> In this epistle the whole thing turns upon the fact that Christ Himself has gone up; therefore the first chapter opens at what I will call the oracle.<a name=17:9></a> Everything is accomplished, we are in unqualified possession.<a name=17:10></a> "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ".<a name=17:11></a> The apostle is not expecting anything; he is expressing what comes out in this chapter in Deuteronomy: worship - the outflow of a heart that is fully satisfied with the portion it has got.<a name=17:12></a> What is worship?<a name=17:13></a> Why a heart that you can not put any more in.<a name=17:14></a> A person in a certain sense is ecstatic when he is in worship, though he may have only just been converted; worship comes out; he is occupied with the One from whom he has received the blessing; he says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ"; that is worship.<a name=17:15></a> Worship is not occupation with the gift, it is occupation with the Giver.<a name=17:16></a> Worship is the
	</div>

		<a name=18>[Page 18]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		heart detained by the object that controls it.<a name=18:1></a> A heart looking for blessing is not really worshipping.<a name=18:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So here you get, as I say, the oracle.<a name=18:3></a> Now in olden times if you had gone to consult an oracle, as people were in the habit of doing, you would have had nothing to say, you would have only had to listen.<a name=18:4></a> Thus here it goes into our portion, telling us seven blessed things that God has given us in Christ; our calling comes out.<a name=18:5></a> But, at the seventeenth verse, there is a change; the oracle turns round and takes part with the listeners; the apostle turns round and begins to pray.<a name=18:6></a> This servant, who has been so wonderfully used of God to open up to us our calling, turns to pray - joins, as it were, us who were the listeners, and says, "That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him, the eyes of your understanding being enlightened, that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints".<a name=18:7></a> The moment I get the prayer, I get the divine energy; and I must have this divine energy, to carry me into the thing that is already mine.<a name=18:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I feel as I read this prayer that I must say Amen to it; and, according as I say Amen, so is my heart rising up in intelligence as to the fact of the place that is already mine.<a name=18:9></a> Really, I <i>am</i> there through grace; I am quickened together with Christ; that is my possession in life.<a name=18:10></a> But, mind you, I have another thing; now comes my possession in practice.<a name=18:11></a> I am rising up to what, as I say Amen?<a name=18:12></a> I am rising up to the place where God has put me in Christ, and God has set Him at His own right hand in heavenly places.<a name=18:13></a> It is just as much the grace of God to put me into heaven as to take me out of hell.<a name=18:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		People think that because they have this place in gift that they therefore have it in practice; but many a man has a property who does not know how to use

		it; it is not the fact of having possession of it that ensures your enjoyment of it.<a name=19:1></a> Scripture warns us against this; "The slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting".<a name=19:2></a> Oh, but he has it!<a name=19:3></a> say you; and has he not had a great deal of trouble in hunting it?<a name=19:4></a> Yes, but he has not used it; he has not turned it to account.<a name=19:5></a> Everybody knows an artisan of first-rate energy and ability by the way in which he finishes his work; he shows his want of energy when he cannot give a thing the right finish.<a name=19:6></a> The finishing is most important; and, I say it with grief in my heart, that where I find a great deal of intelligence about the truth brought out in the Ephesians, there is often very little heart about it.<a name=19:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have sometimes said to people, Did you ever lose a night's rest trying to get hold of your heavenly place?<a name=19:8></a> There is nothing to me more sad than the way in which people will allow that they have not got it, and yet the little earnestness they show in seeking to get it.<a name=19:9></a> The saying of a man who had travelled all over the world often comes to my mind; he said, "The people who care least about their religion, and are least interested in it, are the Christians".<a name=19:10></a> I am sure we ought to lie upon the ground and ask our God to do with us what He will, so that only we may be in the spot our Father has chosen for us.<a name=19:11></a> Can you not say, Oh, I know what I am!<a name=19:12></a> but take that thing out of me that hinders me from rising up to that only spot that will ever satisfy my heart?<a name=19:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I often wonder whether I am ever in an agony about those I know.<a name=19:14></a> Here the apostle is for those he had never seen.<a name=19:15></a> He does not mind losing an hour's rest that he may pray for them that they may reach that spot.<a name=19:16></a> Yet that poor creature there will not stir a finger, would not lose an hour's rest himself, that he might get it.<a name=19:17></a> The apostle was in an agony about people whose faces he had never seen in the flesh.<a name=19:18></a> What for?<a name=19:19></a> That they might live correct lives?<a name=19:20></a> No,

		but that their hearts might be comforted by being brought into the consciousness of their being united to a heavenly Christ.<a name=20:1></a> I am united to Christ.<a name=20:2></a> You are brought into association with Him in the spot where He is, and then you are made acquainted with the fulness that is in Him.<a name=20:3></a> If you do not know that sphere where He is, you cannot come down and be connected with what is of Him here.<a name=20:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now just another point to show you how it is that things begin to decline among us.<a name=20:5></a> It is the way in which people hold the truth of the unity of the body.<a name=20:6></a> I will tell you how this truth was revived; it was in this way.<a name=20:7></a> A brother well known among us awoke up one morning with the thought: I have a Head in heaven, and, if so, there are many others on earth who have got a Head in heaven; and therefore we are members of one another.<a name=20:8></a> You are united to Christ as Head over His body, and you are brought into association with each other because of your union to Himself.<a name=20:9></a> It is a question of <i>holding the Head</i> .<a name=20:10></a> I must have to do with the One who is the <i>source</i> of it all.<a name=20:11></a> I have to do with <i>Him</i> .<a name=20:12></a> I have to do with the <i>Head</i>, and not with the <i>members</i> .<a name=20:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In one moment we may be introduced into a region of unspeakable delights, as the apostle Paul was when he was caught up into the third heaven, but it takes a long time before we are fit to live that out down here - before we are fit to be instruments of the truth we have learned.<a name=20:14></a> I am sure I was fourteen years after I knew what the heavenly calling was before I was able to match it in my life.<a name=20:15></a> We have to be put in circumstances to test us.<a name=20:16></a> Instead of Paul finding that he was going to be something wonderfully great when he came down from being in such a region, he found that he had a thorn in the flesh to buffet him.<a name=20:17></a> If I get up higher in heaven I am only all the lower on earth; higher in the new order, but lower in the old.<a name=20:18></a> But I am content to be nothing if only the power of Christ

	<div class="paragraph">
		But have I to come down into this rude world again?<a name=21:6></a> Yes, like an exotic from the equator in a northern clime, by some unseen power I am maintained here in a scene that is contrary to me - I am sustained here by the divine energy of the Spirit of God.<a name=21:7></a> Christ's body is here, and it is as we draw upon the Head, we find what it is to represent Him here.<a name=21:8></a> Angels look on at the wonderful fact, that the Man the world refused is now represented by His people on the earth.<a name=21:9></a> As we draw from the Head we become useful members.<a name=21:10></a> It is not that Christ's body is only forming now, but that it is here to represent Him; and we drop into Christ's first interest here in the measure in which we come from Him in heaven.<a name=21:11></a> My first interest here becomes His body.<a name=21:12></a>

		An evangelist perhaps will say, My business is to go out to preach the gospel to the world.<a name=21:13></a> Yes, so it is; but your business is to go out <i>from the church</i> to gather sinners, and to bring them in as a recruiting sergeant brings his men to the doctor to pass; otherwise you are a detached person.<a name=21:14></a> The Lord always keeps up the complement of the body; you have to recruit the ranks, and, if you do not go out from the body you do not know your business at all.<a name=21:15></a> Every member is necessary, but every member is not acting.<a name=21:16></a> The evangelist says, There are empty places in the heart of Christ, and I am going from the heart of Christ to bring those in who will fill them.<a name=21:17></a>

		Well, to go on with our chapter.<a name=22:1></a> As I have been saying, I make this distinction between possession in life and possession in practice.<a name=22:2></a> In the first chapter of Ephesians I am in possession of life of the place; and the apostle's first prayer is that I may practically get hold of that place, where, he winds up with telling me, Christ is seated as Head over the body.<a name=22:3></a> And now I go on to the second prayer which is the fulfilment of <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#26">Deuteronomy  26</a>.<a name=22:4></a> I am in possession, and what is going to occupy my heart?<a name=22:5></a> Why the Person who brought me there.<a name=22:6></a> When I reach heaven what will occupy my heart but the Christ who has brought me there?<a name=22:7></a> As one has said, the apostle, having got his first prayer answered, makes the second - that your heart may be a basket for Christ.<a name=22:8></a> Christ is to dwell in your hearts by faith - for what purpose?<a name=22:9></a> It is that you "may be able to comprehend with all saints, what is the breadth, and depth, and length, and height, and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God".<a name=22:10></a> You have come now to ecstasy.<a name=22:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I will seek to explain what I mean by ecstasy.<a name=22:12></a> The apostle uses the word, and I cannot find a better; he says that to God he is <i>beside himself</i> .<a name=22:13></a> It is the fulness of Him that filleth all in all, and you cannot take it in; it is like trying to put an ostrich egg into a small egg-cup; it cannot get in.<a name=22:14></a> You are ecstatic, and the result is, you worship.<a name=22:15></a> You cannot but say, "unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus, throughout all ages, world without end".<a name=22:16></a> You are entranced - in the glory will be the climax of it - but even <i>now</i> you are entranced with the blessedness like the queen of Sheba.<a name=22:17></a>

		As to my state, it is one of death in trespasses and sins; so that if I were to set about meeting the account, about paying the debt, I should not know how; I have no power; it is the night of death.<a name=26:10></a> But now what God has done is to send His own Son, when man was quite dead, to answer to His mind.<a name=26:11></a> He is proclaimed as His beloved Son on the mount of Transfiguration, and that, too, as a Man.<a name=26:12></a> But from that point He descends - the Man who is the example - He descends to become a victim for us, because we were entirely away from God.<a name=26:13></a>

		That is the first point, and I need not dwell upon it.<a name=26:14></a> But it is an immense thing for us to see that God has satisfied Himself, and now He wants me to look at the One who has satisfied Him.<a name=26:15></a> God has honoured His own provision; He Himself has done it.<a name=26:16></a> "You

		Up to the cross every trial was made of man; and then at last God sent His Son, found in the fashion of a man.<a name=35:5></a> At what age of man did He send Him?<a name=35:6></a> At the best age of man?<a name=35:7></a> No, but when man was in ruin, at the very tail of everything.<a name=35:8></a> And not like the first man did He come, grown up to maturity, but He was found as a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, and lying in a manger - a babe, as has been said, that never had a temper.<a name=35:9></a>

		Thus He comes in, and for thirty years leads a life of which we have scarcely a mention.<a name=35:10></a> We get just a passing notice of what it must have been in John, where he says, that if every one of the things He did should have been written "the world itself could not contain the books that should be written".<a name=35:11></a> We get little touches showing us what the stupendous nature of that life must have been, until it culminates in the fact that He is found upon the mount of Transfiguration - as a man He is found there - and is declared to be the "beloved Son in whom I am well pleased".<a name=35:12></a> Of David you hear such and such a thing recorded, perhaps one in a month that was worthy of mention; but every action, every word, every single movement of the Lord was so perfect, so full of grace, so expressive of what He was, that every single one of them is worthy of being recorded.<a name=35:13></a> I am speaking of Him only as a Man in flesh now.<a name=35:14></a>

		When God looked down from heaven He could not find a man to meet His mind until His own Son stood before Him.<a name=36:3></a> There He stood within the legal limits, but He said, I do not confine myself to the limits of the law.<a name=36:4></a> He says, I will not only help my neighbour, but I will take care of him for ever.<a name=36:5></a> "Take care of him, and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee".<a name=36:6></a> Christianity is above law.<a name=36:7></a> There He went up to that mount of Transfiguration; He went up as having answered to the mind of God, and was seen transfigured, His face shining as the sun, His raiment white as the light; there He stood, a man in the flesh; and, as has been said, He might have passed away at once by rightful title straight up to the right hand of God.<a name=36:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I have come to what I was leading to yesterday morning in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7">Acts  7</a>, but there it is more intricate.<a name=37:3></a> We find Stephen, outside the apostles, offering Christ from the glory to come back again.<a name=37:4></a> He is the rightful King here, but He has been refused a place here.<a name=37:5></a> He had not yet sat down on the right hand of God, but we know from another place He is set down now.<a name=37:6></a> I turn on to the eighth chapter to see what the order is there.<a name=37:7></a> We have seen in the seventh, that the One whom God sent into the world they refused when surrounded with humiliation as Joseph's son; and that now they will not have Him when He is offered to them in glory.<a name=37:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in the eighth you get another thing.<a name=37:9></a> We find the eunuch going in the opposite direction to the queen of Sheba.<a name=37:10></a> She came from Ethiopia - "the uttermost parts of the earth", as it is called - to hear the wisdom of Solomon.<a name=37:11></a> He has his back turned to Jerusalem, and as he is on his way to Gaza, the angel of the Lord says to Philip, you go down there; the Lord tells the evangelist to go to him.<a name=37:12></a> He read Esaias the prophet: "He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth: in his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation?<a name=37:13></a> For his life is <i>taken from the earth</i> ".<a name=37:14></a> See where he stops; it is at a most momentous point.<a name=37:15></a> The real significance in the action of the eunuch is this, that, the moment he saw he had to deal with a Saviour who had not to do with the earth, he practically took the place in baptism of having nothing to do with it either.<a name=37:16></a> He says, If <i>His</i> life is taken from the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And now see the progress in the ninth chapter, for the point I want to reach is "the testimony of the Lord".<a name=38:3></a> In the fifth verse we get Saul of Tarsus saying "Who art thou, Lord?<a name=38:4></a> And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest".<a name=38:5></a> The Lord now, as has been often said, connects Himself with the saints upon earth; it is not the saints in heaven.<a name=38:6></a> I see nothing but that one Man in all the saints on earth.<a name=38:7></a> The body is <i>Christ</i>, I do not understand anything about church militant and church triumphant.<a name=38:8></a> The distinction between the house and the body is this, that the Holy Spirit forms the body, and dwells in the house; and He dwells in the individuals that compose the body - in each member of it.<a name=38:9></a> The Lord says, That is Me, that is Me, each one that you are touching; I claim all that are Mine to be connected with Myself.<a name=38:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The character of <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9">Acts  9</a>is that He walks into the scene, and says, <i>I</i> am the <i>only</i> Man.<a name=38:11></a> I walk into the scene and I claim to be <i>the Man</i> .<a name=38:12></a> I claim all to be Mine.<a name=38:13></a> He connects it with no previous dispensation.<a name=38:14></a> He is <i>Head</i> of the creation in <i>type</i>, but in <i>fact</i> He is the <i>Beginning</i> of the creation.<a name=38:15></a> I only see that one Man.<a name=38:16></a> I look round and I see but Him.<a name=38:17></a> As I look at every child of God I see but that one Man.<a name=38:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And for myself, is there any fear in my heart when I know that I have a Saviour in the glory?<a name=38:19></a> The nearer I am to my Saviour the safer I am.<a name=38:20></a> When I know that I have a Saviour in the brightest place, I am most at home in the brightest place.<a name=38:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, mark what the effect of this is upon the apostle.<a name=38:22></a> "Straightway he preached <i>Jesus</i> in the synagogues" - the <i>Man</i> whom he had seen.<a name=38:23></a> The

		word is <i>Jesus</i> - not <i>Christ</i> as we have it; it is Jesus as Son of God.<a name=39:1></a> One dwells on it with unutterable delight!<a name=39:2></a> God looked down here once to see a Man who met His mind.<a name=39:3></a> And now I look up unto glory, and I see there with delight that very Man who met it here seated at His own right hand, and I trace the blessing to the heart that sent the blessing.<a name=39:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So Saul goes into the synagogues and says, "Jesus is the <i>Son of God</i> ".<a name=39:5></a> This is the first time it is preached.<a name=39:6></a> We cannot stay to dwell upon it, interesting as the subject is.<a name=39:7></a> We come to "the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the <i>Son of God</i> ".<a name=39:8></a> "God dwelleth in him and he in God" is yours, if you believe that Jesus is the Son of God.<a name=39:9></a> I have got to the dignity of His Person, and He leads me to the place where He is.<a name=39:10></a> This is "the rock" on which the church stands.<a name=39:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A great many people say they are "on the rock".<a name=39:12></a> I do not believe they know what the rock is.<a name=39:13></a> I say, Do you know that you are connected with the Son of God?<a name=39:14></a> If you are, then why do you not give up all the trifles here?<a name=39:15></a> Trifles?<a name=39:16></a> Yes!<a name=39:17></a> <i>Everything</i> is a trifle here when you see what you are connected with.<a name=39:18></a> I am of that Man; He is my Head; everything falls into insignificance before such a thought.<a name=39:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now I turn to a chapter in 2 Corinthians - the twelfth - where we find: "I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.<a name=39:20></a> And I knew such a man (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) how that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter".<a name=39:21></a> Here the apostle is speaking of a fact.<a name=39:22></a> Here he has to do with a Man in heaven.<a name=39:23></a> It is not only that I have to do with a Saviour who is not here, but I know where the Saviour is; here the apostle is taken <i>into</i> heaven.<a name=39:24></a>

		This place does not minister to the flesh at all; there is no place for it here.<a name=40:1></a> If the flesh comes in in singing a hymn, then you are not in the presence of the Lord; if you were in the presence of the Lord, flesh would be ignored.<a name=40:2></a> Here I do not know whether I am in the body or not; therefore the true character of ecstasy is that it has no sound.<a name=40:3></a> Joy has a sound.<a name=40:4></a> Ecstasy is the rapt sense of the soul detained in the presence of the One who delights it.<a name=40:5></a> Worship is delight in the Person who controls it.<a name=40:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#12">2 Corinthians  12</a>I have got to do with Christ on an entirely new ground.<a name=40:7></a> A man in Christ is taken into a new sphere.<a name=40:8></a> He does not know whether he is in the body or not; he is sustained there without knowing how.<a name=40:9></a> But when he comes back to consciousness he knows well enough that he is in the body.<a name=40:10></a> When he comes down, instead of finding that it is a higher thing for himself in humanity, he finds it is a lower thing.<a name=40:11></a> He has a deeper sense of how degraded he is as a man, because he has a more exalted sense of what he is in Christ.<a name=40:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this was "above fourteen years ago".<a name=40:13></a> He takes time to ripen before he can speak of it.<a name=40:14></a> I doubt not he had a great deal to be broken of during those fourteen years.<a name=40:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would like to dwell a little on the epistle to the Ephesians, as perhaps it may help me.<a name=40:16></a> In it the apostle tells us what the calling is - the vocation, which I divide into seven heads.<a name=40:17></a> The first is the place: I bless "the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ" - those blessings in Christ which the apostle has got here in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#12">2 Corinthians  12</a>.<a name=40:18></a> The second is individual relationship: He has "predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself".<a name=40:19></a> The third is the inheritance: "In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=41>[Page 41]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will".<a name=41:1></a> The collective relationship of the body is the fourth: He "gave him to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all".<a name=41:2></a> The fifth is the new man: He has "abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man".<a name=41:3></a> Now you have got the new place and the new man; the earth is not our place, and the man here is not our man.<a name=41:4></a> Sixth, the Spirit: "through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father".<a name=41:5></a> He is the only link and connection that we have with Christ.<a name=41:6></a> What is your connection with man?<a name=41:7></a> The flesh.<a name=41:8></a> What connects you with Christ?<a name=41:9></a> The Spirit.<a name=41:10></a> It is quite simple; all the feelings in the world would not connect you with Christ; it is the Spirit only.<a name=41:11></a> Then seventh: we "are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit".<a name=41:12></a> That is the calling.<a name=41:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now mark, you are to walk in all the power of this calling; you are to "walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called".<a name=41:14></a> Therefore there follows in the end of the epistle a code of practice suitable to the calling brought out in the beginning of it.<a name=41:15></a> Romans is the justified man, and the practice there is suitable to a justified man.<a name=41:16></a> Ephesians is the heavenly man, and you get practice suitable to a heavenly man.<a name=41:17></a> These are the only two codes of practice that I know of; all the rest of the epistles are corrective.<a name=41:18></a> Here, in Ephesians, we get the apostle in the prison in Rome, and the Lord says to him, Now you come and instruct the church about what it is to be connected with the Man in heaven.<a name=41:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now let me try to sum up what I have been saying, and to make plain what this testimony of the Lord is that we are not to be ashamed of.<a name=41:20></a> It is quite simple that, as you are united to a Man in heaven, and heaven is the place that you belong to,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=42>[Page 42]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		therefore, as His body upon earth, you are not in anywise connected with anything here.<a name=42:1></a> I am united to a Man in heaven so that I may know that all my thoughts, and joys, and expectations are in another scene - a scene that is foreign to my birth and condition here; I am not without association with all that is here, but I must ignore the man that is here, and the place that he is in.<a name=42:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As I was saying, the epistles with the exception of Ephesians and Romans are corrective.<a name=42:3></a> The Corinthians wanted to give the man his place; and they did it licentiously.<a name=42:4></a> The Galatians said, No, we will keep the man in order.<a name=42:5></a> They tried to make a <i>religious</i> man of him; they said, We will make him a teetotaller.<a name=42:6></a> Thus the Galatians were worse than the Corinthians.<a name=42:7></a> We must be like the emigrants going out to the new country who burned their ships as soon as they landed, to preclude all possibility of return.<a name=42:8></a> A buried man has nothing to show.<a name=42:9></a> In Colossians the apostle is in an agony about their not holding the Head; for the great point is that I am united to a Man in heaven; that is the great truth.<a name=42:10></a> Then the epistle to the Hebrews has to do with earth.<a name=42:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The great point is that I am united to a Man in heaven.<a name=42:12></a> And the way in which that truth woke up again in the church any one can see who likes to read a paper that came out in the first part of "The Witness"; you will there find an account of the effect the truth of being united to a Man in heaven had upon a brother well known to us.<a name=42:13></a> He awoke one day with the thought, I have a Head in heaven; and if <i>I</i> have, there are many others all over this earth who have a Head in heaven, too, and therefore we are members of each other, and form one body.<a name=42:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what is the consequence of this?<a name=42:15></a> and why should people be ashamed of it?<a name=42:16></a> Why the fact is, that if this truth were acted out it would make you just like the man in <a href="../bible/John.htm#9">John  9</a>; no one would have him!<a name=42:17></a>

		Now the apostle says, Do not be ashamed of it.<a name=43:11></a> You must refuse the man that is here, for that man will not do at all; neither will the place do where that man is.<a name=43:12></a> The Hebrews wanted to go back to earth.<a name=43:13></a> Well, then, he says, if you do you will lose your priest.<a name=43:14></a> Christendom says, You must get your priest to go to heaven.<a name=43:15></a> No, says Hebrews, if you do not go to heaven first, you will not get your priest at all, for He is <i>in</i> heaven.<a name=43:16></a>

		Now God's thoughts are towards man, but He comes in in His own divine way to carry them out.<a name=44:2></a> God never takes a suggestion from man; He has His own mind and purpose to carry out towards me, and it is not what I say that will alter Him a bit; He has a distinct mind as to what He is going to do; He is a wise Father.<a name=44:3></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It has been remarked before that the life of Abraham is properly divided into three parts.<a name=49:1></a> The first is the land; the second, the heir; and here we come to the last, which is the greatest; and, though consecutive historically, they are nearly parallel typically.<a name=49:2></a> It is not simply the place, neither is it the Lord in the place, but we are now brought in to learn what it is practically to have our "faith and hope in God".<a name=49:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In speaking of Abraham here, I will first recite the simple case, and then how it is doctrinally true, and lastly how it is practically true.<a name=49:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, here is Abraham entitled to everything that God had given him, but he is called to put all the lights out, with his own hands.<a name=49:5></a> There is nothing wrong in what he has, but he is to throw himself into darkness on this side, that he may have the light on the other side.<a name=49:6></a> He offered up his son, counting upon "God who raises the dead".<a name=49:7></a> He threw himself into darkness in this present scene, so that he might have the light in that.<a name=49:8></a> You must accept the darkness on this side if you are to have the light on that.<a name=49:9></a> When I present the fact that we have to do with the Man in heaven, that involves your placing yourself in darkness as to the man here: that is a tunnel.<a name=49:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The more we are in the tunnel, the more we are leaving the darkness behind us, and coming to the light on the other side.<a name=49:11></a> The darkness is connected with what we are passing through.<a name=49:12></a> I do not want you simply to take hold of the fact that you are united to a Man in heaven, but I want your soul to accept the tunnel.<a name=49:13></a> I begin with the fact that I have to do with One in glory who is the light, and joy, and undivided

	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		resource of my heart; but, on the other hand, what do I accept in this present scene, but that all goes into darkness here in order that I may more enjoy the brilliancy of the light that is on the other side?<a name=50:1></a> You will find that practically we are all brought into the tunnel on this side.<a name=50:2></a> That is what Abraham was called to do, and he finds that it is God, as Jehovah-Jireh, that he has to do with: it is that same word that he says to Isaac as they are going up the hill; when he has reached the point he can say, The Lord will see to it; God will provide Himself a lamb.<a name=50:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now let me just note one or two matters connected with it.<a name=50:4></a> I suppose even the youngest child could not read this chapter without being struck with the thought that it was no easy matter, this man going up day after day to reach a point where, with his own hand, he was to put out all that was cheering to him on earth.<a name=50:5></a> What sustained him, as with measured tread he advanced up the hill?<a name=50:6></a> He says, I count upon God as I pass into the tunnel; I have to find my way through this impenetrable darkness.<a name=50:7></a> He does not run at the thing; he does not hastily accomplish it; but it was day after day, step by step, and he reached it with his heart deepening in the fact, I have to do with God.<a name=50:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Oh, it is a wonderful thing!<a name=50:9></a> And, believe me, when you come to speak of practice, the measure of your strength is the measure of the strait you go through with God.<a name=50:10></a> You say, I have gone through deep sorrow; but the question is whether you have gone through it with <i>God</i> - as counting upon <i>Him</i> .<a name=50:11></a> The strait you have passed through with God is the real measure of your strength; that is what it is in every case.<a name=50:12></a> Therefore the scripture says, "Count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations; knowing this, that the <i>trying</i> of your faith worketh patience".<a name=50:13></a> It is <i>trying</i>, not <i>trial</i> .<a name=50:14></a> It is no trial to a horse to jump over a fence; he only really makes manifest what is already there.<a name=50:15></a> And your faith will be put to the trial,

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=51>[Page 51]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		if you use the word in that way, but it is only <i>trying</i>, not <i>trial</i> - it is putting it to the test.<a name=51:1></a> Abraham had this faith forty years before it was tried.<a name=51:2></a> There is forty years between Paul and James.<a name=51:3></a> James says he was "justified by works", when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar.<a name=51:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Have you faith about a certain thing?<a name=51:5></a> Do you say, I have seen it and know it?<a name=51:6></a> Well, I say, you will be tried certainly; it may be thirty or forty years before you are, but it will come out in the end; you will certainly be tried.<a name=51:7></a> The children of Israel were accustomed to earthly blessings, and the Lord showed them that they were learning more by trial in the wilderness, where for forty years He suffered them to hunger and fed them with manna, that they might know "that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth man live"; they found out thus what God was, the One who was to be their Succour in it.<a name=51:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So with Abraham here; it was the faith that he had before that is now being put to the test.<a name=51:9></a> He had seen the star-spangled sky, and had said, I believe that.<a name=51:10></a> And now, says God, here is the heir, and a great many years ago you said you believed me; now I am putting you to the test: put him to death.<a name=51:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Death is that for which we have no remedy; and, what is more, there is no law of nature about death.<a name=51:12></a> It takes anybody, young or old - anybody; it does not come after a certain number of years; it is arbitrary.<a name=51:13></a> It is not a question of a thing that is mendable; it is not a thing within the compass of man; that is the reason it brings in God with it.<a name=51:14></a> He was to put him to death; he was to offer him up; he expected God to raise him from the dead; but, as far as he himself was concerned, he was to put himself into complete darkness.<a name=51:15></a> When death comes in, there is no remedy; God says, I stand there; death is a thing beyond <i>you</i>; you cannot touch it.<a name=51:16></a> The reason I speak of it

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		now is that this was the thing that was called for in Abraham.<a name=52:1></a> When we come to practice we find it is darkness, but the moment our eye rests upon Christ we get light in it.<a name=52:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Abraham here went into the tunnel; indeed he was more like a contractor making a tunnel for himself.<a name=52:3></a> He found a way through it to God; the way that faith penetrated through to get to the light on the other side.<a name=52:4></a> He could say, Well, I can take the darkness, I can bring it in with my own hand, because I count upon God who raises the dead.<a name=52:5></a> How this was fulfilled in the Lord!<a name=52:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The heart is not sufficiently honest about it.<a name=52:7></a> Did you not bring death into the world?<a name=52:8></a> You have brought it in, for death was the judgment for sin.<a name=52:9></a> And yet people seem so surprised when death overtakes them: and we all have felt it.<a name=52:10></a> Well, who brought it in - this terrible thing - this anomalous thing?<a name=52:11></a> What is the character of it?<a name=52:12></a> Why, that "man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward"; so much so that the poet says, "Every great thought is allied to melancholy".<a name=52:13></a> That is what we have brought in ourselves.<a name=52:14></a> We are not only suffering from the judgment of God, but we cannot look at the dearest object we have on earth without thinking: Death may lay its finger on it, death may sweep it away.<a name=52:15></a> We have brought it into the world ourselves, so we ought not to be surprised at its overtaking us.<a name=52:16></a> Thus it is that the man who possesses most in this world is the most miserable.<a name=52:17></a> Solomon says, "Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, that thou canst not know them".<a name=52:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the Lord has come in and what He has done is this.<a name=52:19></a> He was the Son of the Father - He was the perfect Man who answered to the mind of God; but He says, I am not going to abide alone.<a name=52:20></a> I do not think we estimate what a terrible thing it was for Christ to die; He, the Creator, the Prince of Life!<a name=52:21></a>

		We do not estimate what it was for Him to be brought into the dust of death; He says, "Father, save me from this hour", and "Thou hast brought me into the dust of death".<a name=53:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On the Lord's day morning, when the saints are gathered round the Lord's table, the heart is sad and grieved as one sees their demeanour and their dress.<a name=53:2></a> If it were one of their own relations that had died, their whole demeanour would be different; so would their dress be different.<a name=53:3></a> And we go there not only to remember the death of our greatest Benefactor, but that He <i>died for me</i> .<a name=53:4></a> I say nothing shows the unfeeling nature of our hearts more than the way we take the death of Christ.<a name=53:5></a> You cannot meet a greater death than the death of Christ.<a name=53:6></a> Death has done its worst; the greatest death I can ever have to meet is the death of the Lord.<a name=53:7></a> I often prepare myself for the death of friends in thinking of this.<a name=53:8></a> Christ's death has thrown the whole of this scene into a new order of things; it threw man out, and cast the terrible shade of His own death over all here.<a name=53:9></a> I am in the scene where Christ has died, and the table of the Lord is the avowal of this, that I have passed from the man that is here, to the Man that has died for me.<a name=53:10></a> I "show the Lord's death till he come".<a name=53:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is the wonderful centre-point of Christianity.<a name=53:12></a> In baptism I renounce myself because of the death of Christ; but the Lord's supper is the avowal that I not only touch Him in His death, but that I have communion with His body, and with His blood.<a name=53:13></a> I am like the very Man that was here upon earth; I have His very nature.<a name=53:14></a> I have reached Him through His death.<a name=53:15></a> "Father, save me from this hour; but for this cause came I unto this hour".<a name=53:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The characteristic expression of the Lord's supper is that we have passed from the man that is here.<a name=54:3></a> So says the apostle to the Corinthians: I have shown you your folly; now I speak as to wise men.<a name=54:4></a> "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?<a name=54:5></a> The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?<a name=54:6></a>" It is through Christ's <i>death</i> that I reach the Man that is there, and thus I am referred back to <a href="../bible/John.htm#6">John  6</a>, and eat His flesh and drink His blood.<a name=54:7></a>

		They all bungled about this from the beginning.<a name=54:8></a> Every one says, We like to be like Jesus, and I agree with it, but how do you work it out?<a name=54:9></a> I say, I never can reach Him but through His <i>death</i> - death of judgment, and death of calamity, too.<a name=54:10></a> I have communion with the blood of Christ, and I have communion with the body of Christ.<a name=54:11></a> I make a way through; I go down into the darkness that I may find Him at the other side.<a name=54:12></a> <i>He</i> goes down into it.<a name=54:13></a> <i>When</i> is the Son of man glorified?<a name=54:14></a> When He goes down under all the weight of our judgment.<a name=54:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You see the saint in this scripture in two positions very different from each other; the one a position of unbroken enjoyment; the other, one of conflict and power.<a name=68:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Enjoyment is for heaven; power is for earth.<a name=68:2></a> You have the enjoyment all inside with God; and this so great, that, as Paul says, he knew not whether he was in the body or out of the body.<a name=68:3></a> But now, having tasted enjoyment up there, he comes down to "take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, them am I strong".<a name=68:4></a> There you need power.<a name=68:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I want to know, beloved friends, who is the man that can take this place?<a name=68:6></a> Who is the man of power on earth?<a name=68:7></a> The man who alone can take this place is the one who has learned what he can glory in - the one who knows that he has the brightest scene with God above.<a name=68:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This principle, which to any student of Scripture is quite evident, you get plainly enough all through the Old Testament.<a name=68:9></a> In Joshua, for instance, you see the children of Israel, after they enter the land, have first to do with the presence of the Lord; circumcision takes place - the inside thing (chapter 5); and then they go out in power against their enemies; they walk round Jericho, and the walls fall down flat.<a name=68:10></a> Power comes out - the outside thing - power comes out in opposition to everything that is against them.<a name=68:11></a> There could not be a greater contrast than there is between the fifth and the sixth chapters of Joshua.<a name=68:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, whilst we find <i>standing</i> clearly taught in the New Testament, it is in the Old Testament that we

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is of the greatest importance to us practically, in such a day as this, to know what power is, and how it may be had.<a name=69:3></a> There has been a great deal of light given to us on the word of God in these times, but now, amid such breadth and clearness of statement of truth, the great want is <i>power</i> .<a name=69:4></a> Generally people do not fail in enjoyment of the truth, but they fail in power to carry it out.<a name=69:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the scripture we have read, the apostle had come from a scene of unbroken enjoyment, to find that there was given to him a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet him.<a name=69:6></a> He was almost overcome by it.<a name=69:7></a> But the effect of it was to teach him, that what he was now to glory in was "infirmities, reproaches, necessities, persecutions, distresses for Christ's sake; for", he adds, "when I am weak, then am I strong" - a sentence that is entirely inexplicable to the mind of man.<a name=69:8></a> Paul was to know the power of Christ in his weakness, and to find that that weakness was the very opportunity for the expression of power.<a name=69:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		People are often sorely tried when they find that failure succeeds a time of spiritual enjoyment; the effort of Satan, at such a time, is to make the heart question whether there really was any enjoyment at all; and he often succeeds.<a name=69:10></a> This is where saints fail.<a name=69:11></a> Many a one is extremely happy in his private meditations; there is not a cloud when he leaves his room in the morning; but he comes out and he fails directly.<a name=69:12></a> Why?<a name=69:13></a> Because he trusts in his enjoyment instead of in Christ.<a name=69:14></a> His enjoyment is true, but he begins to question it, because he fails.<a name=69:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I will use a word which I think will make it plain to you.<a name=70:5></a> People confound their <i>acceptability</i> with their <i>acceptance</i> .<a name=70:6></a> You should never have a question as to your acceptance, but you cannot be too anxious about your acceptability.<a name=70:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The great lack of the present day is that people are not anxious about their acceptability; but no amount of anxiety would ever make you one bit more accepted than you are.<a name=70:8></a> A rose tree <i>is</i> a rose tree, though it may never bear a rose; a poor thing truly, but still a rose tree; but it is not an acceptable one.<a name=70:9></a> A goldfinch <i>is</i> a goldfinch, though it never sing a note; but it is not an acceptable one.<a name=70:10></a> You cannot seek too much to make yourself acceptable; break your heart over <i>that</i>, and you will not be wrong.<a name=70:11></a>

		"Enoch walked with God", and "he had this testimony that he pleased God"; there was an acceptable man.<a name=70:12></a> "By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous"; there was an accepted man.<a name=70:13></a> Therefore Scripture says, "We labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be acceptable to him" - not "accepted" as it is in our translation - "for we must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ".<a name=70:14></a> This is acceptability.<a name=70:15></a> Faith, without a particle of works, gets me into the place God has given me; works determine my position, and it is important to keep this in mind.<a name=70:16></a>

		in which God has placed me; but, as to my body, I am down here in a scene of frailty and infirmity, and the very weakness of my body becomes an opportunity for the grace of Christ to shine out, so that "when I am weak, then am I strong".<a name=71:1></a> The power is to be known in the weak point.<a name=71:2></a> This is a truth which comes home to every one of us.<a name=71:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two things I want to say.<a name=71:4></a> One is, what power effects in a person.<a name=71:5></a> Power is to be known at the weak point.<a name=71:6></a> Power is not so much what you do, as what you are.<a name=71:7></a> Every one is trying to <i>do</i> something, but you will never <i>do</i> anything except as you are it.<a name=71:8></a> The body is a poor weak vessel, but it is in that power is seen; therefore the apostle says that he takes pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in things that affect him as a man in weakness, for he has learned that, because there was a danger of his being puffed up, "a thorn in the flesh" has been sent to him.<a name=71:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, as I said, there are two things here: one, the power that proves itself in my weakest point; the other, that I <i>have patience</i>; and patience is the greatest element of power.<a name=71:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The man of power is known in a double way: wherever there is a defect morally, there you will find its opposite will come out; there will be a virtue there.<a name=71:11></a> Suppose a man is a drunkard; he is converted; and now it is not that he abstains from drink merely, but that he has a taste for sobriety.<a name=71:12></a> You may suppress a vice in the power of nature, but that does not put a virtue in its place.<a name=71:13></a> You must not only pluck up the weed out of your garden, but you must introduce a divine plant in its place.<a name=71:14></a> I state that when a Christian is walking in grace the defect in his nature is supplanted by a virtue.<a name=71:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The action of power is different with respect to a defect and to mere weakness.<a name=71:16></a> In the former, as I have shown, there is a virtue introduced in its place.<a name=71:17></a>

		<a name=72>[Page 72]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the latter, though the weakness - such as timidity, natural nervousness - continue, yet "My grace is sufficient", and the power of Christ rests on you.<a name=72:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A person may say, I have great enjoyment in the Lord.<a name=72:2></a> I do not doubt it, but I might reply, you have not much power.<a name=72:3></a> How do you know that?<a name=72:4></a> Because you are very defective in your walk.<a name=72:5></a> I do not see you triumphing over this or that defect in your nature.<a name=72:6></a> If you had power, you would be triumphant in your defects and supported in your weaknesses.<a name=72:7></a> See Elisha, how he follows Elijah with the most devoted heart, but he has not power yet.<a name=72:8></a> Power is the carrying out in your body the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=72:9></a> It comes out in the point where you are defective.<a name=72:10></a> You can see a person of power at once.<a name=72:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Take as an example that verse in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4">2 Corinthians  4</a>"We have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us".<a name=72:12></a> I speak now of what power is in itself.<a name=72:13></a> That is the wonderful place the Lord puts it in - poor earthen vessels - "that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us".<a name=72:14></a>

		I hear persons say continually, "Oh, you must make an excuse for me!<a name=72:15></a> that is my besetting sin, or my special weakness!<a name=72:16></a>" I reply, I can make <i>no</i> excuse for you: that defect is the very opportunity for divine strength; that is just where you ought to be the strongest.<a name=72:17></a> What would you think of a medical man, whom you sent for on account of a head-ache, if he directed his attention to every part but your head, and did that no good at all?<a name=72:18></a> Why, you would say, You have failed in the very point for which I sent for you.<a name=72:19></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I turn to the second prayer in Ephesians, and the first thing I call your attention to is the importance of what the apostle is about to press in this prayer.<a name=80:1></a> Little touches of any kind mark the importance of the subject.<a name=80:2></a> He says, "I bow <i>my knees</i> unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ".<a name=80:3></a> It is a little thing, but it shows the contrast between the two prayers.<a name=80:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As has been already said, there are two things in these two prayers: the one is standing; the other, state; and the state, as I will show you, becomes a cause of more anxiety to the servant of God than the standing; not that the standing is not important, but that the matter of deepest anxiety is state.<a name=80:5></a> I go further, and I will show you examples from Scripture to prove what I say - everything you do here is according to the state you are in at the time - not according to your standing, but according to your state.<a name=80:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The danger with us who have learnt something of our standing is to overlook our state.<a name=80:7></a> We are anxious till we know our standing; there is a legality about us which makes us anxious until we do know it; when you first come to know it, it is like the sun rising after a dark night; but if you stop there you are sure to go down.<a name=80:8></a> Many a saint has felt the wonderful joy and delight of discovering his standing which he had been reaching after, and then failed utterly as to keeping this joy, through not maintaining the state corresponding to it.<a name=80:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You see how important it is when you come to look at the servant.<a name=80:10></a> He says, "I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ".<a name=80:11></a> As has been often remarked, it was "the <i>God</i> of our Lord Jesus

		Christ" in the former prayer; in this it is "the <i>Father</i> of our Lord Jesus Christ".<a name=81:1></a> Here is the state into which we are brought with God; it is not only seeing the thing, but enjoying it - entering into it.<a name=81:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The standing is yours without any effort, yet it is always in the standing that you acquire the state.<a name=81:3></a> But then there is another thing.<a name=81:4></a> It is that not only I have a state Godward but I must have a state Satanward.<a name=81:5></a> You must have a state which is fitted to meet the character of the evil of this present scene, and, according as you have that, you are able to do "according to the <i>power</i> that worketh in us".<a name=81:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the sixth chapter the point is, that, if you give up your state, you lose the benefit of your standing, though it is only because you have this standing that you can get the state.<a name=81:7></a> The danger first is that a person does not see his standing; that I will go into presently; but that is not so dangerous a place as seeing the standing and not walking up to it.<a name=81:8></a> There is a divine instinct in the saint that craves to reach the thing the heart wants - to get hold of the standing.<a name=81:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Have you read the history of Joshua?<a name=81:10></a> As soon as the children of Israel got into the land they were warned not to forget God, for, if they did, they would be worse off than they were in Egypt where they had the river, for they would have no rain.<a name=81:11></a> I am sorry to say I have seen many who have accepted the standing, but who have then given up the state in keeping with it, saying that it was impracticable, and who have thus perished "off the good land" - rather have lost the blessings of the standing.<a name=81:12></a> They have no rain - no present ministration from God.<a name=81:13></a>

		In <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#6:10">Ephesians  6:10</a> I find: "Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might".<a name=81:14></a> Here I have come to the highest point: I am to be strong "in the power of his might".<a name=81:15></a> In the first chapter I get the power acting towards <i>us</i>: "The exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will find, beloved friends, that there is a direct opposing power seeking to divert us from the place God has set us in; so the first thing the soul must get is a firm hold of that place.<a name=82:11></a> Therefore I will turn to: how I get a standing; and I will just mention two or three standings to make it plain to you.<a name=82:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will take the first from <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>"There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus".<a name=82:13></a> That is a standing.<a name=82:14></a> I have nothing in the world to <i>do</i> as to it, but only to accept what God gives me, and open my mouth wider that He may fill it.<a name=82:15></a> There is no such thing as my <i>getting</i> a standing; that is to say, there is no such

		thing as effort on my part to <i>get</i> it; but there is every kind of effort - of exercise - nay, more - of <i>labour</i>, when I have a sense of what a wonderful standing God has brought me into, that I may be practically what God has made me to be.<a name=83:1></a> I believe this is a thing that we are most defective in, and I say, I am labouring before God night and day, so that my state may be practically up to my standing.<a name=83:2></a> A title, without means to support it, merely lays a person open to ridicule and censure.<a name=83:3></a> It is not now a question of the standing, but the question is: Have you means to support it?<a name=83:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The land of Canaan was a land that "drinketh water of the rain of heaven".<a name=83:5></a> That was the support.<a name=83:6></a> The standing was the land, but the rain of heaven was to support them in it - to keep up their state.<a name=83:7></a> So we get here in Ephesians: "That ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height" - the whole plateau - the whole domain - "and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God" - in fact that you may be able to comprehend with all saints the love that has brought you there.<a name=83:8></a> Standing is not enough.<a name=83:9></a> You may be in the land "that drinketh water of the rain of heaven", but what if you are indifferent?<a name=83:10></a> what if you are neglectful?<a name=83:11></a> Then there will be no rain, and you will perish from off the land.<a name=83:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I take the very first standing which the epistle to the Romans sets forth.<a name=83:13></a> "Being justified by faith we have peace with God".<a name=83:14></a> Supposing a person goes on carelessly, it does not at all alter the fact of his title, but he will lose the enjoyment of it; and I believe this is one of the reasons why persons want to hear over and over again of the putting away of their sins: it is just that they are not walking blamelessly - that they are not walking up to the standing that they have received.<a name=83:15></a>

		I turn to a passage in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#13">Romans  13</a>to show that you must keep your state up to your standing.<a name=84:1></a> "The night is far spent, the day is at hand; let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.<a name=84:2></a> Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying; but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ".<a name=84:3></a> Now mark, this is written to those who have been told of the fact of their justification by faith, and of their standing in "no condemnation".<a name=84:4></a> God Himself had laid help upon One that was mighty; His arm had brought salvation; He had sent His Son.<a name=84:5></a> This Son was the righteous Man; He met all the mind of God both in public and in private life, until His path as a man culminated on the mount of Transfiguration, where God accredited Him as His beloved Son in whom He was well pleased.<a name=84:6></a> There "his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light", and, when His disciples "were awake, they saw his glory".<a name=84:7></a> From this point Christ descends to go into death, and in that death man was brought to an end.<a name=84:8></a> Man is gone, which is what baptism expresses; whilst in the Lord's supper I find the Man - the first Man in resurrection.<a name=84:9></a> And, in that resurrection, I find that I am not only cleared from the old thing, but that I am being formed into the likeness of the One who has delivered me; I am of the same order - of the stock and lineage of this last Adam.<a name=84:10></a> "Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit".<a name=84:11></a> It is not that He saves many - though He <i>does</i> save many - but the idea there is that the corn of wheat shall have many grains - many like Himself.<a name=84:12></a>

		Now it is most lamentable, but I believe it is most true, that many an honest-hearted person comes to the Lord's table with the thought, that Christ's blood there washes away the sins of the past week; if it be not so, the hymns and prayers are inconsistent, for the most of those that I hear speak of the benefits that accrue to us by the death of Christ; and thus it comes to be a sort of repetition of the mass.<a name=88:9></a> I am remembering the results to me of the death of Christ.<a name=88:10></a> But let me ask you, What is the Lord's table?<a name=88:11></a> It is a very different thing from this: I express there that I have communion with <i>the body of Christ</i>; it is not with the <i>benefits</i>; it is with the <i>Benefactor</i> .<a name=88:12></a> And I am thinking of Him at the moment when He broke with every thing here; I remember Him where He was when He opened the door so that I might have fellowship with Him.<a name=88:13></a>

		I will touch on two or three places in Scripture where my subject comes out.<a name=110:11></a> In the passage I have read, Satan comes in against what God was set upon; he comes in to explain away the word.<a name=110:12></a> It is the <i>word</i> he assails, not <i>things</i>.<a name=110:13></a> When you lose the word you have lost your power.<a name=110:14></a> So he does not begin so much by pointing out to the woman the advantages to be gained as by assailing the word.<a name=110:15></a> Having got the word he attempts to pervert it.<a name=110:16></a> It is, "Yea, <i>hath</i> God said?<a name=110:17></a>" and, "Ye shall not surely die".<a name=110:18></a> He does not yet tempt her to eat.<a name=110:19></a>

		If you study your own history you will see the way you have been ensnared and rescued; and no one is happy who has not got a history - if he do not walk, so to say, <i>historically</i> with God - seeing and understanding God's dealings with him.<a name=110:20></a> I do not mean by this your keeping a diary - a diary is a record of your

		An important thing comes out here which marks the difference between a work of the flesh and a work of Satan.<a name=111:2></a> It is a point of great interest as to the moment when an act of the flesh becomes a work of Satan.<a name=111:3></a> A simple act of the flesh - I mean an act of flesh simply - is just doing something that pleases me at the moment; it is simply gratification of the flesh: as we read: she "saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise".<a name=111:4></a> But in satanic action there is always a design - there is an end farther on to be reached.<a name=111:5></a> The action of the flesh is momentary; it is the present moment that is before me; I like it at the moment; there is no forecasting - no issue to be reached.<a name=111:6></a> But when there is an evil issue to be reached by it, it is satanic.<a name=111:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How would it come in?<a name=111:8></a> "Let not the sun go down upon your wrath, <i>neither give place</i> to the devil".<a name=111:9></a> When you are in a condition for Satan to help you, he will surely do so.<a name=111:10></a> I state the principles in a broad way, and may my doing so give you a deeper sense of what a shelter your heart may find in Christ.<a name=111:11></a> If you get the sense of a terrible never-ceasing foe on the one hand, it will make you more conscious, on the other, of what it is for you to have the Lord for your shelter as you walk through this evil world.<a name=111:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I just pursue the subject, but not to dwell on every example.<a name=111:13></a> I say nothing of Cain, for instance, but pass on to Noah.<a name=111:14></a> Noah does not begin with Satan; he only plants a vineyard; but that is self-gratification.<a name=111:15></a> And, let me warn you, the moment you yield to self-gratification you are in danger.<a name=111:16></a> It is a thing that suits you, and you are allured by it; green fields, no matter what it is, but the allurement comes first.<a name=111:17></a> Woe if you yield to it!<a name=111:18></a> This was the character of the first temptation of the Lord.<a name=111:19></a> When He was a hungered,

	<div class="paragraph">
		If I look at Noah, I see he is set upon the earth on new terms, and the point was whether he would break down in keeping them.<a name=112:2></a> His planting a vineyard was simply self-gratification, but in so doing he failed to keep the word.<a name=112:3></a> "Hold fast the form [the outline or scope] of sound words".<a name=112:4></a> It was the scope of the things that he lost.<a name=112:5></a> It is not, as people so often say, whether you "have a text" or not for a certain action.<a name=112:6></a> Noah had no text - nothing had been said to him about a vineyard; but, Noah, if you had understood that God had put you upon the earth to rule, you never would have done anything to imperil your calling.<a name=112:7></a> He who cannot rule himself cannot rule others.<a name=112:8></a> Satan was meanwhile glorying in the fact that what God had set up in man had failed, and he brings in Canaan, who is the emissary of Satan, and Canaan is cursed.<a name=112:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I now pass on to Aaron himself.<a name=112:10></a> Aaron wanted to please the people, and, through this desire, led away from God, he is soon betrayed into sin by Satan.<a name=112:11></a> It is not that he is a bad person, but, thinking he would meet the condition of the people, he was ready to be the tool of Satan.<a name=112:12></a> It is the converse of Job's case.<a name=112:13></a> He was a good man, who, afflicted by Satan, will not surrender faith.<a name=112:14></a> The calf that Aaron made was the evidence of the Egypt out of which they had come - surrendering the truth of God for idols.<a name=112:15></a>

		You ask, What would be the effect of heeding this counsel?<a name=113:4></a> Practically you would have such a sense of what Satan's power is, that you would know that if you are not in Christ nothing can protect you.<a name=113:5></a> Education cannot keep Satan out; not all the thoughts of man can do it.<a name=113:6></a> One of the greatest crimes I ever heard of has lately been carried out by a man of education; if he had not had intelligence and education, he could not have constructed his infernal machine.<a name=113:7></a> The terrific nature of satanic power is that it is unceasing in its hostility against that which God is set on.<a name=113:8></a> And who, then, escapes his attacks?<a name=113:9></a> Why, those who are not set upon what God is.<a name=113:10></a> They escape from suffering; they escape the pain of his opposition.<a name=113:11></a>

		I pass by the book of Daniel, in which we find more than one instance of his working, and go on to the Lord's own temptation.<a name=113:12></a> Nothing astonishes me like this.<a name=113:13></a> See what the malice of Satan is - malice in the very essence of it.<a name=113:14></a> Here is the Son of God on the earth, and what would Satan do?<a name=113:15></a> Satan in effect says, I will turn the Son of God aside first for a bit of bread - that is the necessary food for every man.<a name=113:16></a> Second, by offering Him the world in a new way.<a name=113:17></a> And, third (God forbid that we should ever fall into it!<a name=113:18></a>) by seeking to make Himself singular among men by the interposition of God for Him.<a name=113:19></a> Thus could Satan seek to upset the very Son of God.<a name=113:20></a> Wickedness cannot imagine goodness, any more than a good man can believe in a bad one.<a name=113:21></a> Here is God's Son, the Creator, on the earth; and Satan thinks he will turn Him aside for a bit of bread!<a name=113:22></a>

		We now pass on for a moment to <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>, where the Lord calls Peter, Satan.<a name=114:2></a> He says, "Get thee behind me, Satan; thou art an offence unto me; for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men".<a name=114:3></a> This is a remarkable thing.<a name=114:4></a> Here is he, who has just received the greatest revelation that was possible for a man coming out with that which is satanic.<a name=114:5></a> The Lord had just before said to him, "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona, for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven".<a name=114:6></a> And now, when the Lord spoke of His death, not as merely saving, but as that through which man should be judicially set aside, "Peter took him and began to rebuke him".<a name=114:7></a> Mark, it is not salvation here.<a name=114:8></a> Peter never objected to be saved - no one does; but Peter objected to man being set aside.<a name=114:9></a> This shows us what Satan is about.<a name=114:10></a> The Lord here brings out what is his great point of attack.<a name=114:11></a> It is accompanied with a great revelation; and this person to whom the revelation has been made cannot endure the fact that man is to be set aside - to find his end on the cross.<a name=114:12></a> "Be it far from thee, Lord; this shall not be unto thee".<a name=114:13></a> And the solemn answer is: "Get thee behind me, <i>Satan</i> ".<a name=114:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I now travel on to see how this is worked out.<a name=114:15></a> But I must first take another thought in connection with this principle, so I just state the fact, in passing, that when the Lord was being crucified, Judas was actually carried off by Satan: "Satan entered into him".<a name=114:16></a> But Peter is sheltered.<a name=114:17></a> The Lord says to him, "Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat, but I have prayed for thee".<a name=114:18></a> Satan gets round him first by great bravery for his Master; he is carried away by his natural prowess, and cuts off the high priest's servant's ear, and then he will go on to the high priest's house to see the end.<a name=114:19></a> It was

	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>find Ananias and Sapphira the tools of Satan; he makes them believe that the Holy Spirit is not in the church.<a name=115:8></a> He says to them, You may tell the lie, no one will ever find it out; and you will get an advantage in two ways: you will have the credit of having given all that you possess to the church, and you will also have a good bit of the money for yourselves.<a name=115:9></a> The object of Satan here is to disparage and undermine the work of God, and to neutralise His grace.<a name=115:10></a> The temptation offered to them was that of eminence in the church of God.<a name=115:11></a> That was the bait with which Satan deluded them.<a name=115:12></a> It is well, when anything is put before you, to ask yourself the simple question: Is this Christ, or is it a bait?<a name=115:13></a> Christ is the only measure for everything; can I answer, I have enough in Christ?<a name=115:14></a> This is the practical benefit of being in the presence of Christ; I can then say, Having Him I can do without anybody; I am perfectly happy with Christ.<a name=115:15></a> Can you do without your family?<a name=115:16></a> Well, I say this, that the sense of the presence of Christ consists in being able to say, "No bread"; nothing but Christ; nothing for the human side.<a name=115:17></a> When I come down to the wilderness I want other things; why, I want a coat, for instance; but up there, in His presence, it is ever "No bread".<a name=115:18></a> You may be a very sincere man, but I do maintain that

		I look now for a little at the epistles.<a name=116:11></a> What was their failure at Corinth?<a name=116:12></a> It was that they would spare <i>man</i> .<a name=116:13></a> It is not that they would not accept Christ for their <i>sins</i>, but they would not accept Christ <i>crucified</i> as their pattern here on earth.<a name=116:14></a> There are three things important for the soul to see.<a name=116:15></a> First, God in the cross of Christ clears me of everything that stood between me and Him.<a name=116:16></a> Second, I am united to Christ in glory; I am put where He rules, where His sway is owned.<a name=116:17></a> Third, I return now to the cross to turn out everything in myself that would hinder the outshining of Christ.<a name=116:18></a> You admit that you are clear of your sins; if you were not you could not be united to Him in glory; and now you are to resist everything in you that is contrary to Him, that the light may shine out in this vessel that He has redeemed to Himself, and that you may come out here in the strength and grace of Christ.<a name=116:19></a> <i>The man must go</i> .<a name=116:20></a> And this the Corinthians would not have.<a name=116:21></a>

		The consequence was, that Satan got in.<a name=117:1></a> I do not comment on it; but I just point out how that, in the second epistle, they were slow to receive back the offender.<a name=117:2></a> They had been unduly lax; now they are unduly severe.<a name=117:3></a> Says the apostle, "I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him, .<a name=117:4></a>.<a name=117:5></a> .<a name=117:6></a> lest Satan should get an advantage of us".<a name=117:7></a> I mention it to show how he first mars the work of God by introducing terrible laxity among the saints, and then by leading them to go too much the other way.<a name=117:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another thing I just turn to in the first epistle to Timothy.<a name=117:9></a> In these two epistles to Timothy we get mention of "the latter times" and of "the last days".<a name=117:10></a> We are now in the latter of these two; and I wish to show you the difference between the satanic action in the two.<a name=117:11></a> It is the same principle here that we have already noticed.<a name=117:12></a> In "the latter times" of the first of Timothy, Satan brings in a system with which we are all acquainted - Romanism - which is an exaction on man; hence, of course, it is not supersession.<a name=117:13></a> It is just the difference between exaction and supersession.<a name=117:14></a> An exaction on the man admits his existence.<a name=117:15></a> Satan substitutes a new kind of godliness for the divine godliness brought before us in the preceding verse, and this consists in exaction on the man.<a name=117:16></a> If I say you are not to marry, not to do this and that, I admit that you are alive.<a name=117:17></a> Satan will bring in <i>anything</i> to make me admit that I am here.<a name=117:18></a> Let Ishmael stay in the house; make a servant of him, if you like; but do give him a corner.<a name=117:19></a> No, he is to <i>go out</i> .<a name=117:20></a> So Romanism came in to substitute something for God's supersession of man here, and that substitution is exaction.<a name=117:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in the second of Timothy it is not substitution that he brings in, but imitation.<a name=117:22></a> Oh, but is not Romanism still going on with its exactions all around us?<a name=117:23></a> I have no doubt that it is; but besides Romanism, another phase of evil has now come in: we read of

		"having a form of godliness, but denying the power", and of those who are "ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth".<a name=118:1></a> These "resist the truth", as "Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses".<a name=118:2></a> It is imitation of the truth, and that not in a person who has never learned it.<a name=118:3></a> It is imitation, combined with sickly sentimentality, which the term "silly women" expresses; it does not mean literally women, but the effeminacy of character which goes after this imitation.<a name=118:4></a> This is the character of the last days.<a name=118:5></a>

		All I am saying is conveyed in the first sentence I uttered, namely, that Satan is ever set against that which God is set upon.<a name=118:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you look at Ephesians, you find that Satan is always opposing the saints who faithfully pursue their heavenly calling.<a name=118:7></a> It is when we have on the whole armour of God that "we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places".<a name=118:8></a> It is there that the warfare is unceasing.<a name=118:9></a> There is something exceedingly fearful in the virulence of it.<a name=118:10></a> If you are determined to enjoy your rights to heaven, his opposition to you will be unceasing, and therefore it is compared to wrestling - every sinew is strained to the uttermost to upset the antagonist; and all this because I insist upon my rights.<a name=118:11></a> Many a one has proved the severity of the struggle.<a name=118:12></a> God will help them; that is enough.<a name=118:13></a> But many a one, because he insisted on his rights with not strength enough to maintain him - many a one who has been the brightest, the foremost of all - has been floored by Satan.<a name=118:14></a> Their purpose, however, is known to God, and He certainly will restore them.<a name=118:15></a> They were set on going on to glory, but they did not look for the protection offered them by the way - they had not on their armour - and so they were drawn aside.<a name=118:16></a> And then it is said of them, "Oh, there are

	<div class="paragraph">
		There are just one or two more points I should like to touch on.<a name=120:16></a> First, the way in which God makes use of Satan.<a name=120:17></a> I believe He uses him to correct the saints and to scourge them.<a name=120:18></a> In Job's case how terrible for him to know, if he did know it, that he was in the hands of Satan; that it was Satan who had taken away his sheep, his camels, his oxen, and his sons and daughters.<a name=120:19></a> And Satan was glad to do it; and he was glad to be the thorn in the flesh to Paul.<a name=120:20></a> Just think of it!<a name=120:21></a> I believe it would give us far greater sobriety if we thought more of these things, if we saw that we are never safe from the attacks of Satan but in the hands of the Lord.<a name=120:22></a>

		I feel impressed to bring before you, beloved brethren, the subject of rule, in the hope that a few words upon it may enable us to distinguish between clericalism and radicalism.<a name=122:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Clericalism is the assumption of rule in a teacher.<a name=122:2></a> The teacher is not necessarily a ruler, though the ruler may be a teacher.<a name=122:3></a> Radicalism is that which wants to be independent of all rule.<a name=122:4></a> Nothing is more important for us practically at this time than to see that it is more according to the rule than according to the teaching in a place that the progress is.<a name=122:5></a>

		Rule is not merely government; it is oversight.<a name=122:6></a> "If a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?<a name=122:7></a>" It is character that is the qualification for rule.<a name=122:8></a> I see it in every place that it does not depend upon the gifted person there, but upon the character of the oversight.<a name=122:9></a> A teacher <i>may</i> be an elder, but it is not of a teacher but of an elder it says, "They watch for your souls".<a name=122:10></a> And of such it says, "Obey them that have the rule over you" - the guides, properly speaking.<a name=122:11></a> I therefore have read this verse as the best passage I can find to bring the subject before you.<a name=122:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From the beginning I see how necessary it is to be subject to rule.<a name=122:13></a> At the very start the breakdown was through disobedience; and the first commandment with promise is in connection with obedience to rule.<a name=122:14></a> The wife is to be in subjection to her husband.<a name=122:15></a> It is a principle which you find pervading all Scripture, and the contrary principle you find running parallel with it all through also.<a name=122:16></a> Cain says, "Am I my brother's keeper?<a name=122:17></a>" Christianity maintains that you <i>are</i> to be your brother's keeper; it is the principle of <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is always a tendency to connect rule with teaching; and that is clericalism.<a name=124:15></a> I do not know anything that has caused more confusion than teachers trying to be rulers, gaining a certain prominence in rule because of their having a gift.<a name=124:16></a> Teachers are often young men, and I say to such, you <i>must</i> be subject to rule.<a name=124:17></a> There are other qualifications for rule besides that of age.<a name=124:18></a> I never take the place of rule myself, though certainly I am old enough; still I lend my aid to any ruler in case of difficulty.<a name=124:19></a>

		Young Christians are full of enthusiasm as to the wonderful truths that God has recovered to us in these last days, but I believe we have no conception as to what the original church was - as to its magnificence on the earth.<a name=126:10></a> I am as ready as any one can be to acknowledge with my whole heart before God the marvellousness of the grace that has visited us; I believe it is the most marvellous thing that the Lord should have taken us up and revealed to us His mind, as He did to His disciples at the beginning, in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24">Luke  24</a>; but I should like to know what "the laying on of the hands of the presbytery" was, and what the gift that was given Timothy "by prophecy".<a name=126:11></a> I may make a sort of guess about these things, but they are beyond me quite.<a name=126:12></a> It is not that we are not to be full of thanksgiving for what we have got, but I do say that a great deal of humble waiting on the Lord is needed that He would indeed instruct us as to what is "the house of God" - as to what the church is in His mind; as it says, "That thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God".<a name=126:13></a> When man looks at it it is the house of God: when Christ works, in it it is the body.<a name=126:14></a> A man cannot behave himself in the <i>body</i>, but he is called to do so in the house.<a name=126:15></a>

		There is an order that runs all through the epistle.<a name=129:4></a> In chapter 3 we have what the church should be here - "The pillar and ground of the truth"; and in chapter 4 comes in the apostasy, or Romanism, which attempts to set up another order of things by exaction - not supersession, which was the necessary result of "Jesus Christ come in flesh".<a name=129:5></a> If He have so come, He has of necessity superseded the man that was here; and so wicked spirits will not acknowledge Him as having so come, because it supersedes everything of Adam.<a name=129:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But Romanism comes in admitting that the man is alive.<a name=129:7></a> It is the effort of the enemy to make a man religious without God.<a name=129:8></a> Radicalism is the effort to elevate him in his own way, and so it is called <i>liberality</i>, and is simply exalting man; so that 'gain is godliness'.<a name=129:9></a> They will be rich; they get a certain power by wealth.<a name=129:10></a> The moment a person seeks the elevation of man, he looks for all that will raise him; and so wealth comes in.<a name=129:11></a> Therefore it says in the midst of such things, "Charge them that are rich in this world".<a name=129:12></a>

		I would also notice that the apostle Paul would not take from the church at Corinth, whilst he would take from an individual Corinthian.<a name=130:4></a> I am not sure that the assembly is up to giving in ordinary cases; there is too much partiality in the saints.<a name=130:5></a> Stephanas and his companions supplied Paul with what was lacking on the part of the Corinthians; though he would not take from them, he was "glad of their coming".<a name=130:6></a> In this way it is the company in which you are least a receiver as a labourer in which you will be the happiest working.<a name=130:7></a> You will be all the happier for not being dependent on them; they receive from you, and not you from them.<a name=130:8></a>

		READINGS ON SOME OF PAUL'S EPISTLES
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I propose that we should look through two or three of the epistles; for so many read detached portions of Scripture without getting at the scope of it.<a name=133:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It has been asked, "What is a Roman?<a name=133:2></a> What stature would a man who only studied Romans come to?<a name=133:3></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Romans we have "the gospel of God".<a name=133:4></a> To see this, we must begin at the third chapter.<a name=133:5></a> In the previous ones we get man ruined; here we see how that ruin is met.<a name=133:6></a> But I would notice, in passing on to it, the very important statement in chapter 1, that this gospel is "Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh, and declared the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead".<a name=133:7></a> It is the gospel of the seed of David <i>risen</i>; and that leaves no hope for the Jew on natural grounds.<a name=133:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But to see the stature to which you come in the Romans, we pass on to chapter 3, where we find the value of the blood, and, because of it, find that we get shelter - that God is "just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus".<a name=133:9></a> I want an ark first to save me from judgment; but I do not get to <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>until I am in the sweet savour of <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#8:21">Genesis  8:21</a>; until I know that as He is, so am I in this world.<a name=133:10></a> Noah could say, Though I am not a better man than I was before the flood, yet I am now in sweet savour before God; in the place where I was in fear of judgment, I am now in favour.<a name=133:11></a> "Being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ".<a name=133:12></a> I am in favour on earth; and then I rise to "joy in God".<a name=133:13></a>
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then someone says, 'I am very unhappy'.<a name=134:1></a> What!<a name=134:2></a> after being so happy?<a name=134:3></a> After knowing peace with God, and joy in Him?<a name=134:4></a> Yes.<a name=134:5></a> Oh, then you have found out there is sin <i>in</i> you.<a name=134:6></a> But there is a release from that: "our old man is crucified" with Christ; there is an end of it before God.<a name=134:7></a> Romans takes you thus far, but it does not take you on to crucified to the <i>world</i> .<a name=134:8></a> And the consequence is, that Romans are very nice people; they are just like Frenchmen in England.<a name=134:9></a> They say, We are strangers here; we do not speak the language, nor do we follow the manners; but we get all the good things we can, out of the country we are in.<a name=134:10></a> And, moreover, they are always ready to learn Ephesian truth, too.<a name=134:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>You</i> are not dead in Romans, but in chapter 6 you are dead to <i>sin</i>; and in chapter 7, dead to the <i>law</i> .<a name=134:12></a> <i>God</i> has "condemned sin in the flesh" for you, but <i>you</i> are not rid of it in yourself, though you are to reckon yourself dead to it.<a name=134:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is "<i>through</i>" Christ all along till you get to chapter 6: 11 - 23; it is not "<i>in</i>" till then.<a name=134:14></a> Then it comes in, because, if you move away Adam, which has been done in chapter 6: 6, you must put the believer in somewhere.<a name=134:15></a> Now no longer in Adam, he is in Christ.<a name=134:16></a> It is an important thing for the believer to know that he is <i>in</i> Christ; because, if he sees himself there, he knows that he is not in Adam's state any longer before God.<a name=134:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So a good Roman has "joy in God" in chapter 5, and now, in chapter 8 Christ is the spring of all to him, and the righteousness of the law is fulfilled in him as he walks not after the flesh but after the Spirit; and he has not only resurrection with Christ through the Spirit, but through Him he also mortifies "the deeds of the body".<a name=134:18></a> In this he comes very near Colossians, but not quite to it.<a name=134:19></a> He has come to "Abba Father", and he is an "heir of God", but there is not a word of being in heaven as in Ephesians,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=135>[Page 135]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		though he is looking forward to it, "waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our body".<a name=135:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"If ye live after the flesh ye shall die; but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live", is an abstract statement.<a name=135:2></a> There are only the two standings before God; if you are in the standing of the flesh, you will die; if you are in the standing of the Spirit you will live.<a name=135:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Roman is not only then clear of everything that stood between him and God, but he is a son.<a name=135:4></a> And I hold it impossible for a man to have a cloud when he has the sense that he is a son of God.<a name=135:5></a> Talk of a cloud!<a name=135:6></a> Impossible!<a name=135:7></a> But there is great vagueness in the state of souls as to their relationship.<a name=135:8></a> They speak of God truly as <i>a</i> Father, but in doing so they are not really beyond the Lord's prayer, "Our Father which art in <i>heaven</i> ".<a name=135:9></a> They just know that He is <i>like</i> a Father to them, but they do not know sonship.<a name=135:10></a> There is no question as to their being converted, but they do not know that they are His <i>sons</i> .<a name=135:11></a> A Roman is a son and heir; but it does not say what he is heir to.<a name=135:12></a> I do not think he has got so far as what Paul is told is the gospel: "To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me".<a name=135:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He sees that creation is vanity, and that all here is to be removed; but that is not sitting in heavenly places in Christ, nor anything like it.<a name=135:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus in chapter 3 we get shelter; chapter 4, forgiveness of sins, and sin not imputed; chapter 5, peace and joy; chapter 6, dead to sin; chapter 7, dead to the law, but with sin in you; chapter 8, life in Christ in resurrection.<a name=135:15></a> It is not the <i>man's</i> death; it is <i>Christ's</i> death.<a name=135:16></a> I am a live man going through the darkness, not out of it yet.<a name=135:17></a> It is Christ who has risen; I am not risen.<a name=135:18></a> In Romans it is a question of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=136>[Page 136]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		sin, and I want <i>death</i> to get out of that.<a name=136:1></a> Chapter 7 is the most painful experience that a believer can pass through; I find that I am not in keeping with the life that is in me.<a name=136:2></a> The real Roman would be very glad to find that this world was a grave; but it is not.<a name=136:3></a> He knows that God is <i>for</i> him.<a name=136:4></a> And at the end of chapter 8 we find priesthood.<a name=136:5></a> And thus we are even "more than conquerors through him that loved us"; we get a touch of the power that is in us; and nothing is able to separate us "from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord".<a name=136:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Many souls fancy that they are in a state in which they are not; because they have great aspirations they suppose themselves in some higher place spiritually than a Roman whilst they have really never yet known what it is to be one.<a name=136:7></a> Souls that have got into Ephesians and Colossians without going through Romans, are not established.<a name=136:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then we get chapter 12, the presenting of the body "a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God"; a being "not conformed to this world".<a name=136:9></a> For this I do not want peculiarity in dress or other things.<a name=136:10></a> I am not nonconformed, but I am transformed.<a name=136:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Galatians the first verse gives the character of the epistle, and has been often commented on.<a name=136:12></a> "Paul, an apostle, not of men, neither by man".<a name=136:13></a> There is no antecedent to it on earth.<a name=136:14></a> It is a thing that comes out <i>de novo</i>, and in which man is totally ignored.<a name=136:15></a> Paul was a man himself who had thought much of man, who had so kept the law that he could say, "touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless"; but, when he came to see Christ in glory, he never spoke to Him of man at all; he never alluded to Adam, as we see where he recites his conversion a little lower down in the chapter.<a name=136:16></a> It is just the opposite to what we get in Hebrews, where everything is traced right down from "the fathers".<a name=136:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=137>[Page 137]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This ignoring of man helps the Galatians, for they had gone back to Adam.<a name=137:1></a> A Galatian is really a Roman who has gone back from Romans 8.<a name=137:2></a> It is no longer true of him that "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made him free"; he desires "again to be in bondage".<a name=137:3></a> It is really the new school of 'holiness by faith' that has come up.<a name=137:4></a> In that, law is the standard, and perfection in the flesh the aim.<a name=137:5></a> Doing good things merely is not Christianity; Christ working in me is.<a name=137:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The law was given to suit a servant, and therefore cannot suit a son, but he is a very bad Christian who does not go higher than the law.<a name=137:7></a> Here Paul is "dead to the law".<a name=137:8></a> His great point is, I do not recognise myself; it is His Son in me; "the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God".<a name=137:9></a> As soon as he was converted, he preached that Jesus was the Son of God; and now he says that <i>He</i> is revealed in me, <i>I</i> go into the background.<a name=137:10></a> In speaking of his conversion here, it is not simply the mode of salvation that is brought forward; it is that Paul had now to do with this blessed One, whom he had seen in glory, and that he had to learn how this could be effected.<a name=137:11></a> It was through God revealing His Son in me, so that Paul had the same life as He; it was "not I, but Christ liveth in me".<a name=137:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Every believer has the same title, though every believer does not enjoy it.<a name=137:13></a> There are three witnesses to the fact that all possess it, as John tells us: "the Spirit, and the water, and the blood; and these three agree" in one testimony: that God "hath given to us eternal life, and this life is <i>in his Son</i> ".<a name=137:14></a> It is wonderful the way in which John and Paul thus help one another.<a name=137:15></a> John brings God's Son down to earth, and Paul takes us up to Christ; therefore a man who teaches Paul's doctrine, dwells much on John's.<a name=137:16></a> And, what is very interesting in Paul and John is that, in speaking of the same truth, they reverse the way of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=138>[Page 138]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		stating it.<a name=138:1></a> If John says, "Father and God", Paul says, "God and Father".<a name=138:2></a> If John says, "peace and life", Paul will say, "life and peace".<a name=138:3></a> Talking of washing and of sanctification, Paul will put the sanctification before the washing, and John the washing before the sanctification.<a name=138:4></a> Just as you constantly find help in different brothers' teaching: one will take one side of the truth, and another the other.<a name=138:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		However, to return to our epistle.<a name=138:6></a> In chapter 2 he says, I will not give up this truth, neither for the youngest saint nor the oldest; neither for a young disciple like Titus, nor for an old apostle like Peter.<a name=138:7></a> "I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me", is what he holds to.<a name=138:8></a> This the Galatians had given up; they had gone back to the flesh; they were not seeking to be justified before God "by the faith of Jesus Christ".<a name=138:9></a> It is strange how perfectionist people are by nature.<a name=138:10></a> I mean, they will put themselves under law as to a certain point, and then take liberty on every other.<a name=138:11></a> There is a difference in the apostle's manner with a Corinthian, to what there is with a Galatian he is hopeful of a Corinthian, of a Galatian he says, "I am afraid of you".<a name=138:12></a> I have more chance of getting at a man who is out-and-out enjoying the world, than I have at one who is legally trying to make a fair show in the flesh.<a name=138:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 3 he brings in Christ crucified to meet their state.<a name=138:14></a> It is not Christ's death as such; it is the ignominious putting of His Person out of the world.<a name=138:15></a> He says, Jesus Christ is set forth <i>crucified</i> before your very eyes.<a name=138:16></a> And, besides this, how did you get the Spirit?<a name=138:17></a> Was that by the law and flesh?<a name=138:18></a> It is just the new school: made perfect in the flesh after beginning in the Spirit.<a name=138:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then he brings them back to Abraham, who got the promise of the Seed four hundred years before the law, and we date from that Seed.<a name=138:20></a> We are not

	<div class="paragraph">
		tenants as we should have been under the law, when we never could have paid the rent; but we date four hundred and thirty years before it, because we belong to the heir.<a name=139:1></a> The law was just a master, a pedagogue.<a name=139:2></a> The thought is that of a master walking on, and all the scholars following after.<a name=139:3></a> So the law led on until it brought to Christ.<a name=139:4></a> It is a wonderful argument; no jury could refuse the title.<a name=139:5></a> I belong to the promised Seed; faith comes in in connection with the Spirit of promise, and links me on to the new line, and that line is the Spirit line; it is not the flesh; I inherit under another line altogether.<a name=139:6></a> All this is to prove to them that they cannot go back to the old line without losing the inheritance.<a name=139:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to those who would like to be under law, he says, chapter 4, Let us look at these law-keepers; what happened in that case?<a name=139:8></a> As soon as the one after the Spirit was grown up, the one born after the flesh had to go out.<a name=139:9></a> I ask, Have you put him out?<a name=139:10></a> You say, Yes; but he comes in again.<a name=139:11></a> Never mind that; the great thing is, whether you have come to the point that you do not tolerate him.<a name=139:12></a> The thought of the new school is that Isaac is to come in and make Ishmael a good boy.<a name=139:13></a> Ishmael <i>mocked</i>, we are told; and Paul calls that persecution.<a name=139:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 5 we get a very interesting thing: that the Spirit is stronger than the flesh.<a name=139:15></a> The words in verse 17 ought to be, "that ye <i>may not</i> do the things that ye would".<a name=139:16></a> It is a wonderful thing to find out that, if we walk in the Spirit.<a name=139:17></a> we shall <i>not</i> fulfil the lust of the flesh; it is an immense comfort to the heart.<a name=139:18></a> If I were talking to the new school, I would say I have no right to do a wrong thing, but you want me, not to be a <i>new</i> man, but an improved one.<a name=139:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 6: 14 is the grand finale of the epistle: "God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world".<a name=139:20></a> "To <i>me</i>" is the

	<div class="paragraph">
		point; it is not that God is left out, but that the point is where I am placed with regard to the world, and the world to me, by the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=140:1></a> As to what the world is, there is no harm in anything in itself, if it does not influence you: it is the power that it exerts over you that is the evil.<a name=140:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ephesians takes us up in exactly the opposite way to Romans.<a name=140:3></a> There man is seen as alive in sin; here as dead in it.<a name=140:4></a> It is all downwards from God to man.<a name=140:5></a> It is the "water of the rain of heaven".<a name=140:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is in this epistle where we are set "in heavenly places in Christ", that we find the gifts to the church; chapter 4.<a name=140:7></a> I do not believe a man really understands gifts at all until he has got on to heavenly ground.<a name=140:8></a> It is in the place of death in trespasses and sins, in the place where our weakness is brought out to the utmost, that we know the power of "the living God".<a name=140:9></a> This is <a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#3">Joshua  3</a>.<a name=140:10></a> This power, which has first worked out from God to me (chapter 1), now works out of me, as I am "strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man"; beginning with the church in the first part of chapter 4; then in my social surroundings - in connection with my neighbour.<a name=140:11></a> Many a one gets on with those at a distance, who cannot get on with people close to.<a name=140:12></a> So it is "truth with his <i>neighbour</i>", not with someone far away.<a name=140:13></a> And lastly this power comes out in the domestic circle.<a name=140:14></a> If a man has not power at home, he has no power anywhere.<a name=140:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We find three forms of the power which thus comes down into all the difficulties of this scene.<a name=140:16></a> First it comes down from God Himself, it is "the working of his mighty power".<a name=140:17></a> Second it is in <i>me</i>: "strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man".<a name=140:18></a> And when I talk of power in <i>me</i>, I never get the Holy Spirit dissociating me from Christ in any action that He energises.<a name=140:19></a> As we have seen, it is not a question of my doing a nice thing, but of Christ coming out in

		me.<a name=141:1></a> I am a dead man, but I am made to act in the power of God.<a name=141:2></a> And third, it acts out in chapter 6 against Satan.<a name=141:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus, the true answer to an Ephesian is a Philippian.<a name=141:4></a> And it is very difficult to be a Philippian, though every believer has title to be an Ephesian.<a name=141:5></a> I find my heart is a long way ahead of my feet; and it must be so; just as in a man climbing up a ladder.<a name=141:6></a> If you are satisfied with having your head only in advance, you will become enthusiastic; whereas if you are set upon climbing up, you will become laborious.<a name=141:7></a> I have a residence in heaven, and I ought to occupy it.<a name=141:8></a> There are the three steps in Joshua: there is the entering, the possessing, and the dwelling.<a name=141:9></a> A good many of us have entered, a good many have possessed, but dwelling is the grand thing.<a name=141:10></a>

		And lastly, I am so to walk that I may be approved of Him, as I stand here against all the wiles of the devil, "strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might".<a name=141:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Philippians we find Paul in prison telling out the path of a heavenly man upon earth.<a name=141:12></a> In the hands of the Gentile power, shut out from the people of the Lord on earth; he is able to set before them in himself the type and example of a heavenly man upon earth; so that the things that fall out to him are only "unto the furtherance of the gospel".<a name=141:13></a> He can look upon the earth in a new way; all his expectations from it are closed; and now heaven opens to him.<a name=141:14></a> It is not that it was not opened before, but that he was not in a position equal to enjoy it.<a name=141:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Saints have to be thrown into circumstances where the things of God can be made good to them, for the circumstances we are in conduce largely to the carrying out in us of the truth God has committed to us.<a name=141:16></a> John had to go to Patmos to get his line of things, and Paul to a prison to be able to teach his fully.<a name=141:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We see the apostle, then, deprived of everything; and we find him in it the very opposite of Hezekiah, who, when all his links to earth were about to be broken, still could not die.<a name=142:1></a> Fourteen years a most perfect servant of God on the earth, still he says, What shall I do if I die?<a name=142:2></a> In the grave no one praises.<a name=142:3></a> But here is Paul, everything gone from him, he only longs to depart and be with Christ.<a name=142:4></a> He has the blessed sense in his soul that he would like to die, that he might know what it would be to be in that solitude with Him.<a name=142:5></a> In chapter 1 he seeks to die himself in order to be with Christ; in chapter 2 he dies as a servant; in chapter 3 he dies as a martyr; and in chapter 4 he dies to circumstances.<a name=142:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This does not put death in opposition to the coming of the Lord.<a name=142:7></a> If I long to be with Him I long for Him to come.<a name=142:8></a> <i>Our</i> side is in the first chapter; <i>His</i> in the third.<a name=142:9></a> Anyone who is really longing to be with the Lord is longing for Him to come; and anyone who is really longing for Him to come is longing to be with Him.<a name=142:10></a> But you will not be in the moral power of the coming of the Lord if you are not in a state of heart to meet Him.<a name=142:11></a> The mere historical event is often associated with sentiment.<a name=142:12></a> Nothing so answers the question: Am I in a state to see Him?<a name=142:13></a> as another question: Would you like to see Him?<a name=142:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Men are forming for things, fitting for them, all through their lives.<a name=142:15></a> The first circle of a man's life is the expression of what the whole of it will be.<a name=142:16></a> Paul was always a leader, both before conversion and after; but the thing he was most for in nature, he is most against in grace.<a name=142:17></a> The greatest Pharisee becomes the greatest anti-Pharisee.<a name=142:18></a>

		Our circumstances then conduce to our power.<a name=142:19></a> If you were in prison you would be much more able to talk of heaven than I.<a name=142:20></a> Our prison very often is sickness.<a name=142:21></a> There are two great lessons we have to learn; and in this school Paul is a graduate here, as

		Jonah was a learner in the Old Testament.<a name=143:1></a> First, I myself am dead, and I am saved from death; but then I have to learn that everything is dead to me.<a name=143:2></a> The gourd is dead; I have not a single thing to shelter me from the east wind; I have not a single thing left to lose.<a name=143:3></a> I have to learn these two deaths, for through sin I have brought myself into these two conditions.<a name=143:4></a> When people are first converted, though they see themselves saved out of their own death, they have not the sense that death is on everything around them.<a name=143:5></a> Many have to learn this by going through loss; happier to learn it like Abraham going up mount Moriah, by surrender.<a name=143:6></a> Abraham was going on to the resurrection morning as he journeyed to mount Moriah: Paul had reached it.<a name=143:7></a>

		The true way to enter the wilderness is in the words of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>We "rejoice in hope of the glory of God".<a name=147:1></a> That is the song of Moses - the chorus of it: "The Lord .<a name=147:2></a>.<a name=147:3></a>.<a name=147:4></a> hath triumphed gloriously".<a name=147:5></a> It does not say that <i>we</i> have done so.<a name=147:6></a> It is not yourself that has triumphed, as you very often find out; but the chorus is a thing that you never can lose.<a name=147:7></a> You can say, No matter what <i>I</i> am, <i>He</i> has triumphed.<a name=147:8></a> And for whom?<a name=147:9></a> For me!<a name=147:10></a> Well, have <i>you</i> triumphed?<a name=147:11></a> No, but He has, and we triumph in His triumphs.<a name=147:12></a> The natural thought of the people when they got across the Red Sea would have been, We have done something now to be proud of.<a name=147:13></a> But no; it is all the Lord.<a name=147:14></a> Thus I enter the wilderness - enter it with a song.<a name=147:15></a>

		Now, none of us but is conscious how different he is in the presence of the Lord from what he often is in the midst of his daily circumstances.<a name=147:16></a> Many a one enjoys the corn of the land in the quiet of his own room, who, when he comes down, has not the manna.<a name=147:17></a> Many a one has said before now: "I am sorry I ever came out at all; I was happy in my room, and now I cannot get on with men at all.<a name=147:18></a> What I want is wilderness truth.<a name=147:19></a> I can go in, and find myself very happy with God, but see how vexed I am, how ruffled, the moment I step down into my daily life".<a name=147:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now it was not that the joy was not real.<a name=147:21></a> Was not this song real?<a name=147:22></a> They had really crossed the Red Sea.<a name=147:23></a> The very fact of the women singing proved that the burden of their song had permeated society.<a name=147:24></a> Men work in a line; but the women singing proved it was no theory - that it had pervaded the whole.<a name=147:25></a>

		In the preceding verse of this chapter we have what Christ did: He "loved the church, and gave himself for it".<a name=164:1></a> In the verse we have read we have what He is doing now: "That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word".<a name=164:2></a> And in the following verse we have what is future: "That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish".<a name=164:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I desire to bring before you, beloved brethren, is this: what is the present interest of our Lord Jesus Christ touching His own on the earth.<a name=164:4></a> You see I cannot possibly get the other side until I get this side.<a name=164:5></a> I cannot tell how I am to respond until I know what I am to respond to.<a name=164:6></a> We all know something of how He has loved us, but we do not so well know, we are not sufficiently occupied with, what is His present interest in the church, His present service and His present love.<a name=164:7></a> Here we find it in one little verse: "That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word".<a name=164:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I propose to turn to the gospel of John to see how the Lord opens out the nature of what we find stated as doctrine by Paul.<a name=164:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We will turn then to <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>.<a name=164:10></a> It is interesting and important to remember that John was written after the failure had set in, yet the Lord puts on record what is in His heart towards His own on the earth.<a name=164:11></a> There is no thought of division, no thought of separation.<a name=164:12></a> If I look around now I have to see it; I have to see the ruin that all is in.<a name=164:13></a> But if I look up, I see what His heart is; and I am convinced that, if we

	<div class="paragraph">
		understood that heart better in relation to His own upon earth, we should be largely affected by it.<a name=165:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now my intention is to give a little view of chapters 13 to 17; and in what I say I merely suggest for your own after study for, as I often say, I find that suggestive teaching is the most helpful teaching.<a name=165:2></a> The Lord is always dealing with our souls, and when the heart has been exercised about some truth, He gives us help by the way, and everything that He gives us we trace back again to Himself; He uses us as deputies to carry out His own purposes.<a name=165:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to these chapters, 13 and 14 are what I would term "within doors".<a name=165:4></a> It is not public; it is belonging to the assembly, or rather, as I will only use the words that are given to us in this scripture, I will not say "assembly", but "<i>His own</i> ".<a name=165:5></a> He took His place at the supper table with His own.<a name=165:6></a> It is important thus to notice who are within doors.<a name=165:7></a> They are "His own".<a name=165:8></a> There are three places in these chapters: within doors; without doors; and heaven.<a name=165:9></a> There is nothing to do with the world in the last.<a name=165:10></a> We get here the terminable and the interminable.<a name=165:11></a> Chapters 13 to 16 give us what is terminable, that which lasts for a time.<a name=165:12></a> In chapter 17 we have that which is interminable, that which is not of time, which belongs to eternity.<a name=165:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I begin then with the fourth verse of chapter 13, where we read the Lord rises from supper, and lays aside His garments.<a name=165:14></a> I lay great stress upon this, because supper is commemorative of an accomplished work; the atoning work is at an end.<a name=165:15></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>is generally looked at as being relief to the conscience; the washing of the feet being supposed to be the setting aside of our sins.<a name=165:16></a> But I believe that it is an entirely new thing that is now introduced; it is not a question of sacrifice; it is an entirely new work which is introduced, consequent on the completion of the first work - the great work of redemption.<a name=165:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This new work is the washing of the feet.<a name=165:18></a> It is a
	</div>

		<a name=166>[Page 166]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		work never found before in Scripture.<a name=166:1></a> There were sacrifices and offerings, but nothing like this.<a name=166:2></a> Here, having loved His own that were in the world, He does a new thing for them - a thing that we too may have a part in as His deputies.<a name=166:3></a> And what is the effect of this work?<a name=166:4></a> It is in order to restore communion with Himself while He is absent, otherwise "His own" would have "no part" with Him.<a name=166:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe that there is great deficiency amongst us on this point.<a name=166:6></a> I believe there is difficulty in understanding what communion is, because there is not that anxiety about it that characterised our early days.<a name=166:7></a> The very word itself is scarcely used now.<a name=166:8></a> We never hear of anything but "fellowship" now, where it used to be "communion".<a name=166:9></a> Now though "fellowship" and "communion" may be the same word in the original, they express two very different thoughts in English.<a name=166:10></a> I speak of it timidly, but I cannot but say that I regret that there is so little anxiety about communion.<a name=166:11></a> There is anxiety about work; there is anxiety also about walk; but I see very little about communion; and you may have both these without communion.<a name=166:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You may perhaps ask, Then do you object to my preaching about walk and work?<a name=166:13></a> Not at all; it may be very right to do so, but I say right things may be misplaced; and that which is very right, very praiseworthy, may be still out of place.<a name=166:14></a> There may be right things done which are not done in the right way; about which there is no communion - no having part with Him.<a name=166:15></a> Communion is taking the right step at the right time in the right way, and perhaps only <i>one</i> step.<a name=166:16></a> It is only a gardener who can tell the difference at first between a weed and a flower.<a name=166:17></a> An ordinary spectator might say, 'The seeds are coming up very well; there will be a fine crop.<a name=166:18></a>' 'No,' says the gardener, 'they are weeds.<a name=166:19></a>' So the spiritual man "discerneth all things".<a name=166:20></a> He knows which is the weed.<a name=166:21></a>

		I hope we are gathered together at this time to help one another; and to do this we must come close to the point.<a name=167:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thought that we find here is one which is calculated to touch every heart.<a name=167:2></a> The Lord says, I am going on high; and whilst leaving you down here, I have put you before My Father in the unclouded light of His presence, without a spot upon you.<a name=167:3></a> I leave you in a defiled scene, but such is My continuous affection for you that I will make it My business to remove from you everything that might produce distance - everything that might cause reserve between you and Me.<a name=167:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there must be intimacy first?<a name=167:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Yes; that is just what I am coming to.<a name=167:6></a> And I say it sorrowfully before the Lord, I believe that souls are <i>not</i> intimate with Him; there is not the sense of acquaintance.<a name=167:7></a> It is my unfeigned desire for souls that they might form acquaintance with the Lord.<a name=167:8></a> Many have no sense of reserve, because they have never been intimate.<a name=167:9></a> Joseph's brethren were living with him for seventeen years, recipients of his favour, and all the time they did not know him intimately.<a name=167:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But how may I become acquainted with Him?<a name=167:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I answer, that He is gone on high, and therefore there is no acquaintance with Him now but by the Holy Spirit.<a name=167:12></a> It is a wonderful moment to the soul when it first knows the blessed reality of acquaintance with the Lord.<a name=167:13></a> It may not be for years after conversion, but it is the grand characteristic of Christianity.<a name=167:14></a> Sacrifice was not a new thing for the Jews.<a name=167:15></a> They could accept without difficulty the fact that the Shepherd was to die, wonderful though it be.<a name=167:16></a> But that He should say, "and know my sheep and <i>am known of mine</i>", that is an entirely new thing; "as the Father knoweth me, even so I know the Father".<a name=167:17></a> There is the same character of intimacy between Himself and His people as between the Father and the Son.<a name=167:18></a>

		Do I know this intimacy?<a name=168:1></a> If I do not know it, I do not know what it is to have a shade cast upon it.<a name=168:2></a> You cannot lose what you have never had; but the more intimate you are with any person, the more quickly you will discern the smallest shade of reserve, the least change of manner.<a name=168:3></a> Then do not talk about reserve until you know intimacy.<a name=168:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would remind you that whilst the Lord never changes His love, He does change His manner.<a name=168:5></a> John fell at His feet when he saw His eyes as a flame of fire; as much as to say, I do not know that aspect.<a name=168:6></a> We have to bear this in mind.<a name=168:7></a> To the saints we ought never to change our love; but there are at times those with whom we can "have no company", so that they "may be ashamed".<a name=168:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And further: affection is not communion.<a name=168:9></a> Peter was full of affection, but he was not in communion, though he cast himself into the sea to go to Jesus.<a name=168:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But if I am thinking so much of the Lord's things and having part with Him, what about my own affairs?<a name=168:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When I am near Him, I find, as the disciples did in <a href="../bible/John.htm#21">John  21</a>, that He has unbounded forethought for me; the dinner was ready: "a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread".<a name=168:12></a> As the little hymn says:

	<div class="paragraph">
		<blockquote>"Make you His service your delight, <br>He'll make your wants His care".<a name=168:13></a></blockquote>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The more you are in communion with Him the more you will find out how He sympathises with you, and how in the smallest things He is thinking for you.<a name=168:14></a> The more His interests occupy your heart, the more He will surprise you as to the manner in which He thinks of yours.<a name=168:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As I have already said, fellowship and communion, though the same word in the original, do not convey the same thought to us.<a name=168:16></a> If you ask me what I understand by communion, I answer, It is going in company with another's mind.<a name=168:17></a> Like a faithful dog following his master, nothing satisfies him but to go the road

	<div class="paragraph">
		The following chapter is quite a different thing.<a name=169:10></a> Whilst <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>separates us from the defilements of the world, <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>comforts us as we pass through the world.<a name=169:11></a> I divide the chapter into two parts, showing out the double way in which the Lord comforts us as we pass through the world.<a name=169:12></a> He goes up to prepare a place for them.<a name=169:13></a> That ends at verse 14.<a name=169:14></a> Then the descending; He comes down to comfort them here, and whatsoever they shall ask, He will do.<a name=169:15></a>

		Three things are brought out.<a name=169:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First: there is a place up there.<a name=169:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Second: He is the way to it.<a name=169:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Third: He makes known the Father who owns it.<a name=169:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Stephen is practically an illustration of this.<a name=169:20></a> The Lord says, Keep your eye on me, and you know the way, the truth, and the life, the Owner of the place, the Father, and, as you are dependent on Me, the power to take you up to it.<a name=169:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One word as to the power, and I speak it timidly, anxiously.<a name=169:22></a> I do not think we really understand what the good of union is.<a name=169:23></a> I do not look upon union as that which may be illustrated by an engine drawing carriages.<a name=169:24></a> That is <i>connection</i>, it is not <i>union</i> .<a name=169:25></a> What is the nature of union?<a name=169:26></a> I am united to the One who is the Son of God; I am a member of that body of which He is the Head.<a name=169:27></a> It is the most wonderful thing to be the smallest chip of this great wheel - to be the least little bit of it.<a name=169:28></a> John alone tells me the

		nature of it.<a name=170:1></a> But I am not so much speaking of the nature as of the effect of it - the power of it.<a name=170:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to this the Lord says, "He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father".<a name=170:3></a> The Lord's greatest work down here was to raise a man from the dead.<a name=170:4></a> But He says, "Greater works than these shall he do", and "If ye shall ask <i>anything</i> in my name I will do it".<a name=170:5></a> He is effecting a far greater thing for His own now than when He was here on earth.<a name=170:6></a> Stephen is not raised from the dead, but he is made superior to everything on earth; through the power of Christ by the Holy Spirit in him, he rises above all the wickedness arrayed against him, and is superior to the power of death.<a name=170:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How little we have practically of this!<a name=170:8></a> Do we know the exceeding greatness of His power to make us superior to suffering?<a name=170:9></a> Do we overcome evil with good?<a name=170:10></a> Perhaps not able to be superior to an insult?<a name=170:11></a> You may suffer greatly, but is it to be an occasion for complaining, or for overcoming with good?<a name=170:12></a> Where is the power that works <i>in</i> us?<a name=170:13></a> Oh, you say, I thought it was <i>for</i> us?<a name=170:14></a> Not only!<a name=170:15></a> It says, He is "able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us".<a name=170:16></a> Seeing our ignorance is the great way to learn, it is well to say, I am not up to that but I should like to be.<a name=170:17></a> It is well to get a sense of what we should be.<a name=170:18></a> Thus far is the <i>upward</i> side - the <i>power</i> side.<a name=170:19></a>

		Verse 20 gives us the nature of the union.<a name=170:21></a> "At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you".<a name=170:22></a> But I cannot think as I look round me and see, and hear, what goes on, I cannot think that we have grasped the fact of what it is to be united to Christ.<a name=170:23></a> The gospel places me in all the beauty of Christ, in the very place where I was estranged from

		Do we take in this wonderful verse?<a name=171:8></a> "At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you".<a name=171:9></a> Christianity is not a thing that you can take in like a problem of Euclid.<a name=171:10></a> It is the opening out of what makes you feel that, however much you have seen, there is yet more to be acquired, there is a yet firmer grasp to be got of what you hold.<a name=171:11></a> I feel it is important to get a sense of the moral height of our position in Christ.<a name=171:12></a> The magnificence of the place we occupy, on this earth might well fill our souls.<a name=171:13></a> We in Christ, and He in us.<a name=171:14></a> There will be a desperate climax of evil, so heading up as to enable man to say at last that he is independent of God; it is placing him on such a pinnacle of importance that he will assume to dispense with God.<a name=171:15></a> Man is to be so self-cultured, so restrained, that he can avoid every vice, and be able to attain every virtue, and thus support the immense weight of importance that science will have conferred upon him.<a name=171:16></a> Self-culture is the great cry.<a name=171:17></a> But, thank God, the Christian has a divine moral elevation, which eclipses all that man is able to think or do; and no one can raise up a standard against this pretension of man, unless he knows this divine elevation; we can never meet it, except as we eclipse it by the grandeur of the place, of the position, in Christ in which we are placed by the power of the Holy Spirit - the only power that can raise up a standard against it.<a name=171:18></a>

		But perhaps, as you look at the history of faith, you ask: What is the difference between Abraham in the land and Joshua?<a name=186:11></a> I answer, Abraham was the heavenly stranger in type, which Philippians sets forth.<a name=186:12></a> Joshua typifies how God has brought us into possession of His things, not in body yet, but in spirit; and the difficulty is to maintain that ground, and to maintain it as brought there by God.<a name=186:13></a> We see in Israel's history how they failed to do so, and how they were diverted from it by the enemy.<a name=186:14></a>

		We have too much overlooked this hope.<a name=193:2></a> The servant in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#12">Luke  12</a>said, "My Lord delayeth his coming", he dropped the idea of meeting the Bridegroom.<a name=193:3></a> It is that which marks first love; the desire to see Him; and the church of Ephesus lost it.<a name=193:4></a> It is the sense that I cannot do without Him; it is not affection merely; it is that the heart has no full joy except with this blessed One and in His presence.<a name=193:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not think the servant <i>preached</i> it; I believe he <i>acted</i> on it.<a name=193:6></a> He said it "in his <i>heart</i>", and then he went and mixed with the world.<a name=193:7></a> The effect on the church of such service was that "they all slumbered and slept".<a name=193:8></a> Sleep is inactivity.<a name=193:9></a> In Canticles the bride says, "I sleep, but my heart waketh".<a name=193:10></a> There is none of the activity that first love gives; an activity that you never could describe, but it is always equal to the occasion.<a name=193:11></a> A mother does not prearrange what she will do for her baby.<a name=193:12></a> Thus the true heart has such love for Him that it is quick-sighted to know the minute attentions that suit Him.<a name=193:13></a> The outcome of first love is practically first works.<a name=193:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The body of light is one of the traits of the new company on the earth.<a name=299:1></a> I was speaking yesterday of the heavenly character of things.<a name=299:2></a> Now I want to show you what the new company is here.<a name=299:3></a> From the end of chapter 10 to the end of chapter 18 of this gospel you get the traits of the new company.<a name=299:4></a> I present this to you, the body of light, as one of the traits.<a name=299:5></a> The first trait is the word of God and prayer; these we have in chapter 10: 39 to 11: 13.<a name=299:6></a> The second great trait is the body of light.<a name=299:7></a> A body "<i>full</i> of light" is not the right idea.<a name=299:8></a> The idea is a <i>body of light</i> .<a name=299:9></a> In the original there is only one word, and that means <i>the body is luminous</i> .<a name=299:10></a> It does not say that the mind is luminous, but the body is luminous.<a name=299:11></a> I can give you no better illustration than that of a glow-worm.<a name=299:12></a> The whole body is luminous.<a name=299:13></a> That is the subject I desire before the Lord to call your attention to, and I count upon Him to make it intelligible to you, divinely intelligible.<a name=299:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The point in verse 33 is, the candle has been lighted.<a name=299:15></a> In the previous verses we get two types of our Lord which it is most important to connect together.<a name=299:16></a> One is Jonah, which gives us in type the sufferings of the Lord; the other is Solomon, which is the glory of the Lord.<a name=299:17></a> These two properly make up the light.<a name=299:18></a> That is the light.<a name=299:19></a> The light that was lighted was not to be put under a bushel.<a name=299:20></a> You must remember that the same words in another gospel may not mean the same thing.<a name=299:21></a> Scripture never repeats itself.<a name=299:22></a> Now the Lord has a people upon earth, and the character of that people is, they are light; that is, an expression of Himself; as Paul puts it in <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2">Philippians  2</a>, "Ye shine as lights in the world".<a name=299:23></a> Light is

		I desire now to draw your attention to the light.<a name=300:3></a> I am sure the more you enter into the mind of the Lord here in presenting this trait of the new company the more you will understand the blessedness of it.<a name=300:4></a> The great point is, that if you have no part dark, the whole shall be luminous.<a name=300:5></a> It is not <i>full</i> of light as a tumbler is full of water; nor is it the <i>mind</i> full of light; it is the body luminous.<a name=300:6></a> "You glorify God in your body".<a name=300:7></a> Your body is the Lord's; it belongs to Christ for the earth, and it is to be transparent, a light for Christ on the earth.<a name=300:8></a> It is to be the Lord's servant, a body of light, <i>having no part dark</i> .<a name=300:9></a> Why are we not more luminous?<a name=300:10></a> Because there is some part dark; and the saddest part of it is that you do not know what your dark part is, and when you do; you rather conceal it; you do not expose it for removal; you try to hide it.<a name=300:11></a> The "foolish woman" says, "Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant".<a name=300:12></a> We often enjoy something in secret that is obscuring the light.<a name=300:13></a> Thus the dark part is concealed.<a name=300:14></a> We think no one sees it, forgetting that it really hinders the shining out of the light.<a name=300:15></a> Hundreds of people like something they would not let another know anything about, but "all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do".<a name=300:16></a> What I am speaking of is the hindering of the light.<a name=300:17></a> The compromise with one's family, and society, and many other things, are all at work hindering the expression of the light.<a name=300:18></a> We all fail here.<a name=300:19></a>

		If I look at the history of a soul, the first thing is forgiveness.<a name=302:7></a> The effect of forgiveness when known to the soul is to beget a measure of love.<a name=302:8></a> You see this in type in Jonathan, and in the woman of <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7">Luke  7</a>, but that is only love for service rendered.<a name=302:9></a> Do not stop there!<a name=302:10></a> As sure as you stop there the day will come that you will be tested, like Joseph's brethren, who were living on Joseph's bounty for seventeen years without having learnt the love that did the service for them.<a name=302:11></a> The apostle says, "The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, which is given unto us".<a name=302:12></a> If I know His love nothing will suit me but Himself.<a name=302:13></a> You get that beautifully exemplified in the case of Peter, <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#5">Luke  5</a>; "they forsook all and followed him".<a name=302:14></a> The Lord would rather have your company than your property.<a name=302:15></a> The Spirit of God is within you, and He would occupy you with an Object.<a name=302:16></a> Your heart has an Object.<a name=302:17></a> It is not only that your Beloved is yours, but you have learned this wonderful thing, "I am my beloved's and his desire is towards me".<a name=302:18></a> That is the finish in Canticles, as any of you know who have studied it.<a name=302:19></a> What is the consequence?<a name=302:20></a> My heart is towards Him.<a name=302:21></a> It is not a question of effort.<a name=302:22></a> I know how easy it is to deter people by that.<a name=302:23></a> The moment you are in the presence of the Lord, you are dismantled.<a name=302:24></a> Self can have no place there.<a name=302:25></a> It is one of the most significant things that we find all through the Old Testament, that the Lord, when He comes to speak to any one,

		I desire, beloved brethren, to seek to interest you a little as the Lord may help me, in the difference between these two passages; the one presenting the truth, that your body is a member of Christ and the temple of the Holy Spirit; the other, that you are a member of His body.<a name=431:1></a> I believe the two are often confounded, and some quote the former as though it were union, whereas in this passage we have our responsibility; not our position in, nor union with, Christ: "Your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, .<a name=431:2></a>.<a name=431:3></a>.<a name=431:4></a> ye are not your own .<a name=431:5></a>.<a name=431:6></a>.<a name=431:7></a> therefore glorify God in your <i>body</i>" which is God's.<a name=431:8></a> The translators have put in the words, "in your spirit"; just as in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:11">Colossians  2:11</a> they have introduced the word 'sins'.<a name=431:9></a> They could better understand the idea of glorifying God in your spirit, than in your body.<a name=431:10></a> The words, "in your spirit", are interpolated, they should not be there, the thought is the body.<a name=431:11></a>

		I now turn to <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:30">Ephesians  5:30</a>: "For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones".<a name=433:4></a> There are two points here.<a name=433:5></a> First: we are of His kindred; and second; the position which belongs to us as united to Him.<a name=433:6></a> We are of His kindred, of the same order as He is.<a name=433:7></a> That is where the gospel puts us.<a name=433:8></a> It is very evident that if I am a member of His body I must necessarily be of the same order as He is.<a name=433:9></a> What supports this is the quotation from <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:22">Genesis  2:22</a>, 23: "And the rib which the Lord God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man".<a name=433:10></a> When the woman is brought to the man, "Adam said, This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh".<a name=433:11></a> The great thing now is to be brought to the man.<a name=433:12></a> To do this, to bring the soul into conscious knowledge of union with Christ, is the great work of the Spirit of God in this day.<a name=433:13></a> It is an immense fact to get hold of, that nothing of moral disparity could be united to Christ.<a name=433:14></a> If there were not suitability to Him, there could not be union with Him.<a name=433:15></a> We have to learn, and to help others by our own learning, the difference between kindred and position.<a name=433:16></a> Nothing is more erroneous than to think a believer is elevated by being united to Christ.<a name=433:17></a> If he were not of the same order as Christ he could not be united to Him.<a name=433:18></a> The first thing to understand is, <i>kindred</i>; and I believe here is the lack.<a name=433:19></a> In seeking a wife for Isaac, the one thing that Abraham's servant

		of salvation, but the leading characteristic of union is, that your individuality is merged in Christ; you belong entirely to another.<a name=452:1></a> The bride is merged in the Bridegroom.<a name=452:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the three stages, turn to <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#3:18">1 Peter  3:18</a> for the first: "For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God".<a name=452:3></a> I need hardly say much about this stage, but the point is, that the man under judgment has been removed in judgment, and you are brought to God.<a name=452:4></a> All that stood against you has been cleared away to God's infinite satisfaction, and you are brought to God, and like the prodigal son, you are at home in the Father's house.<a name=452:5></a> The Son of God has accomplished this great work.<a name=452:6></a> You must know this first.<a name=452:7></a> Here you must begin.<a name=452:8></a> There is a grievous leaven in Christendom, a great defect in preaching the gospel.<a name=452:9></a> Christ's death is presented to the soul after the manner of the sacrifices under the law, where the pious Jew found relief for his immediate sins, but he still retained the flesh which is enmity against God.<a name=452:10></a> The illustration of a man pressed for the army, and finding a substitute to stand in his stead is not the gospel.<a name=452:11></a> The gospel is that you were under the judgment of death, and that Christ, the Son of God, has borne that judgment, not that you should keep the man who was under judgment, but that you should be completely severed from him in Christ's death.<a name=452:12></a> The being who sinned must go in judgment.<a name=452:13></a> It is not renouncing your bad works; every Christian would be ready for that.<a name=452:14></a> Are you ready to see all that is nice and amiable in you under the judgment of God?<a name=452:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is an immense moment to your soul when you learn that you are crucified with Christ, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that Goliath is not driven away, but dead, judicially ended, and therefore cannot be righteously revived; there is no reviving of it on God's side, "There is no more offering for sin".<a name=452:16></a>

		You ask, Do I not sin?<a name=453:1></a> Yes, but there is no more offering for sin.<a name=453:2></a> If you do not judge Yourself for reviving what He has judged and condemned, He will judge you; the thing that did the sin will suffer for the sin; hence in Corinthians we find a man delivered "unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh".<a name=453:3></a> As God has got rid of that man in the cross, He will not tolerate him in you.<a name=453:4></a> "<i>Our</i> God is a consuming fire".<a name=453:5></a> The man who was under the judgment of God has been judicially terminated in the cross, and the Man Christ Jesus so glorified God in the most distant spot, that He was "raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father".<a name=453:6></a> He is glorified, and now God is free to go out to the most distant spot, to a Saul of Tarsus, and receive him to Himself.<a name=453:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The next thing is, Is the man who was under the judgment of God, and who is gone from God's eye in the cross, gone from <i>your</i> side?<a name=453:8></a> Read <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:12">Romans  5:12</a> to the end.<a name=453:9></a> It is not only that you believe that God has raised Christ from the dead, and that you are on the field of battle as clear as Christ is.<a name=453:10></a> "As he is, so are we in this world".<a name=453:11></a> Jonathan was in the victory of David on the battlefield, so are you in the acceptance of Christ who fought the battle.<a name=453:12></a> Now it is no longer a question of your sins, but of sin in you.<a name=453:13></a> How are you free, "free from sin"?<a name=453:14></a> <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:22">Romans  6:22</a>.<a name=453:15></a> You have died with Christ.<a name=453:16></a> You have changed your man; you have passed from Adam to Christ.<a name=453:17></a> You have died with Him who died and you are in Him who is risen.<a name=453:18></a> Hence in chapter 6 we are told, "Reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Christ Jesus".<a name=453:19></a> Most beautiful!<a name=453:20></a> There you touch life, the abounding grace for the first time; you touch it for relief; that is liberty; hence in chapter 8: 2 we read, "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death".<a name=453:21></a> You have the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of the second Man.<a name=453:22></a> You are free.<a name=453:23></a> "Stand

		The last division was caused by those who insisted that eternal life was given to the man <i>here</i> on believing, which is really on the same principle as under the law: "This do and thou shalt live".<a name=456:9></a> They did not see that, as the man under judgment has gone in judgment, you must be severed from the man under death by Christ's death, in order to be brought into life in Him.<a name=456:10></a> In a word that the life did not come to the man under judgment, but that the man who was under judgment being delivered from it in Christ's death, has life, not in himself but in Christ; Christ is his life.<a name=456:11></a>

		Now if you turn to chapter 15 you will find that there are three traits of the servant.<a name=512:4></a> The first is, you are a disciple, "Abide in me".<a name=512:5></a> Not merely that you understand a passage in Scripture, and can interpret it, but that you are consciously directed by Christ.<a name=512:6></a> If you abide in Him, you come fresh from the Head; you must know the Head to abide in Him, and then you bring forth fruit.<a name=512:7></a> Now you are in the battlefield.<a name=512:8></a> The second trait is you are His friend.<a name=512:9></a> You have the same kind of love for His own that He has: "Love one another, as I have loved you", that is, the eleven.<a name=512:10></a> The eleven were to be devoted in love one to the other.<a name=512:11></a> "This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.<a name=512:12></a>.<a name=512:13></a>.<a name=512:14></a>.<a name=512:15></a> Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you".<a name=512:16></a> Not only His disciples, but His friends.<a name=512:17></a> "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends".<a name=512:18></a> This love should characterise every servant.<a name=512:19></a> The servant should be known as one who would die for the saints.<a name=512:20></a> This exposes you to the hatred of the world, because you are chosen out of the world, and you prefer the company of the saints to that of your own family.<a name=512:21></a> Those who are in no way related to you are more to you than your own relations!<a name=512:22></a>

		Now we come to the third trait, witnessing of Christ by the present ministry of the Spirit.<a name=512:23></a> The present ministry, as in chapter 15: 26, is the light; not <i>some</i> of the light, but <i>the</i> light from the source, Christ as He <i>is</i>, not merely as He <i>was</i> .<a name=512:24></a> The past is light, I admit, but it does not connect you with the source, Christ as He is.<a name=512:25></a> Bring a light into a room and then remove it; you remember the things you had seen, but you do not see them now.<a name=512:26></a> As witnesses

		It is much before me just now to bring before the brethren how little the truth, made known to Mr.<a name=527:1></a> Darby, has been maintained and pursued by us.<a name=527:2></a> I am trying to write a review of the way it has been opposed and refused, and I want them to make it a prominent subject at Quemerford, that they should give it more thought, as that which has been given by the Lord in this century, each one being responsible for its maintenance.<a name=527:3></a> This is my message to them, with my best love.<a name=527:4></a>

	<div class="heading">
		REVIEW OF HOW THE TRUTH, WHICH THE LORD REVIVED TO THE CHURCH IN THIS CENTURY, HAS BEEN OPPOSED AND HOW LITTLE ACCEPTED.

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord was pleased to revive through dear Mr.<a name=527:5></a> Darby, while he was still in the Church of England, the truth that Christ is the Head of the body.<a name=527:6></a> Almost concurrent with this the opposition began.<a name=527:7></a> Dr.<a name=527:8></a> Pusey, who was of his own age, brought into force the great clerical opposition, called Ritualism.<a name=527:9></a> At that time some of the leading men at Oxford -- Mr.<a name=527:10></a> Newton and Mr.<a name=527:11></a> Harris -- left the Established Church, and consorted with Mr.<a name=527:12></a> Darby.<a name=527:13></a> He having also left the Established Church, now propounded the light which he had received, having first learnt the gospel which enabled him to apprehend the truth himself.<a name=527:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I did not know Mr.<a name=527:15></a> Darby until after he was in Plymouth in 1833.<a name=527:16></a> After leaving the University, I went to stay with him at a brother's house at Cork, where I was his constant companion; and just to give an idea of the truth that came out, I mention an attempt of mine to compose a hymn, entirely a new idea to me, as a divinity student, raw from the University, and before I was twenty.<a name=527:17></a>

		Not long after this there was a great movement in Plymouth on prophetic questions, to which Mr.<a name=528:12></a> Newton gave his exclusive attention, and most were carried away by it.<a name=528:13></a> During the few months that I was with Mr.<a name=528:14></a> Darby I used to hear him complain of what was going on as to the line of teaching.<a name=528:15></a> When I was in Plymouth in 1844, they had become a large number, with a very large building to meet in, holding 1,200 people.<a name=528:16></a> That was before the division.<a name=528:17></a> I want to point out how this prophetic teaching first diverted saints from the line of truth which the Lord had given.<a name=528:18></a> The division actually ensued (before the evil doctrine as to the Lord's Person was discovered), because the course of Mr.<a name=528:19></a> Newton and his adherents denied that the saints in one place are one with the saints everywhere, and are practically one body.<a name=528:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next opposition was from Mr.<a name=528:21></a> Dorman, and was joined by Mr.<a name=528:22></a> Darby's own brother and others, who condemned him for saying that the Lord bore sufferings which were not atoning, and that He gave up the life to which sin attached.<a name=528:23></a> So much was Mr.<a name=528:24></a> Darby affected by it that he proposed to cease to break bread; but a few of us met him at a brother's house, and dissuaded him from such a course.<a name=528:25></a> Thus we can easily see how low an idea was prevalent among brethren as to the Lord's humanity and work.<a name=528:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This discussion was a great help to me, because when I looked through Scripture I saw that there were many sufferings which were not atoning sufferings.<a name=528:27></a> And then came the question as to the judgment

		At a large meeting in Manchester in 1873, I remember calling the attention of brethren to the way the enemy had endeavoured to spoil the pure stream given by the Lord, first by one thing, and then by another.<a name=529:7></a> I then referred to the subject -- speaking on the passage, "Not holding the Head" (Mr.<a name=529:8></a> Darby was present).<a name=529:9></a> I was tracing how the truth came out, how it was refused, and how little it had been accepted.<a name=529:10></a> I showed that the opposition of the enemy at that moment took the form of proclaiming the gospel without the church -- limiting the truth to the salvation of souls.<a name=529:11></a> We know what a wave of gospel excitement prevailed at that time.<a name=529:12></a> I remember also calling the brethren's attention at a large brothers' meeting in London to the fact of how the gospel was set forth without separation from the world, and an assumption of holiness without separation from ecclesiastical system -- just the difference between El-elohe-Israel and Bethel.<a name=529:13></a> The one, where there is no sense of His presence, the other-where the presence of God affects you down to the smallest detail of your family.<a name=529:14></a> The leaven has spread from that day to this, namely, that you can have <i>professed</i> nearness to God (the right ground and the right blessing) and yet have no sense of His presence.<a name=529:15></a> It is really the effect of accepting and <i>exclusively</i> adhering to objective truth without the corresponding subjective state, which is the Spirit's work in us.<a name=529:16></a>

		There is, thank God, a better and clearer idea now of what the new creation is than there was thirty years ago; but many of the evangelists do not really apprehend fully that the old man is removed from the eye of God in judgment.<a name=530:4></a> If this were truly apprehended they would not address the old man by seeking to work on his feelings.<a name=530:5></a> It is quite right to awaken souls to their lost condition, but the grace of God is that He has removed that man in judgment.<a name=530:6></a> But I believe that what is not understood is the nature of the <i>Man</i>, the unique character of the One who has superseded the first man before the eye of God; and until this is apprehended, and that we derive from Christ, as members of His body, there can be no apprehension that He is our Head -- the source of all life and power, or of what it is to be united to Him.<a name=530:7></a>
