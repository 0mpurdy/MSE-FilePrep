		There never was a beginning yet but it had a reference to an end, and the end therefore must give a character to the beginning.<a name=1:1></a> True, a person might alter his design as he proceeds, but then his beginning was not in keeping with the end he now has in view, nor is it the one that he would have adopted had he had the same end in view when he began.<a name=1:2></a> There is nothing more evident than that there must be an end in view to every beginning, and the beginning must be in keeping (however distantly) with the end proposed.<a name=1:3></a> The end may be very undefined, but nevertheless it was with reference to it that the work was begun or undertaken.<a name=1:4></a>

		The servant of the Lord receives a commission from the Lord to do a certain thing; he may not be able to comprehend the full result of his work, but in order to be true to the result, he must be true to the commission.<a name=1:5></a> The first thing after the servant's appointment, is his commission.<a name=1:6></a> If he be ignorant of what he is to do, he must of necessity be defective in all his services.<a name=1:7></a>

		Every real servant now is appointed, he is called of the Lord and gifted.<a name=1:8></a> A gift is a specific line of service, and as each servant waits on the Lord, he receives instruction from Him through the word in order that he may please Him who hath chosen him.<a name=1:9></a>

		No one is an evangelist unless he be gifted by the Lord for that ministry.<a name=1:10></a> This is the first thing, and one which no one taught in the word will deny; the next thing is the commission which the evangelist receives from the Lord.<a name=1:11></a> Now here I apprehend arises all the imperfection and weakness in preaching the gospel in this day.<a name=1:12></a> Every servant is only really useful and efficient as he is the bearer of his Master's mind.<a name=1:13></a> Whenever he fails in truly representing the Lord's mind, he fails in his commission, however great his power as an agent.<a name=1:14></a> To "please him who hath chosen him", is the first and chief quality of a

		servant.<a name=2:1></a> It is not enough that he have ability; ordinarily speaking a servant might have every qualification, and yet be unsatisfactory, because he pays little attention to his Master's wishes.<a name=2:2></a> The most gifted evangelist, however great his power and ability, will fail in his service unless he knows what his Lord desires that he should effect by his preaching.<a name=2:3></a> It is therefore of great moment that he should learn from the Lord what he is to do.<a name=2:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In preaching the gospel you must either derive light as to your commission from the Scriptures before the Lord's ascension or after it.<a name=2:5></a> Before the ascension there was salvation for the soul, but there was no assembly, and the evangelist who now relies on the measure of light there was before the ascension for his guidance, is behind the mark, and however gifted he may be, he is defective in the Lord's mind, and is doing the Lord's work negligently; not intentionally, I fully admit, but in a day like this it is of the last importance to be able to discern the one perfect way.<a name=2:6></a> There cannot be two.<a name=2:7></a> Being near the right way, or having any amount of zeal or success, will not compensate for disregard of His mind or for ignorance of His wishes.<a name=2:8></a> To say "Corban" to the Lord is profane or worse, and yet the one who shelters his ignorance or argues for it, because of his or others' zeal or success, is literally doing so.<a name=2:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The gifts were given after the ascension of our Lord and therefore the evangelist now, if he be instructed by the Lord who has conferred the gift on him, must have a distinct end before him, and one according to the mind of Christ.<a name=2:10></a> The evangelist either falls back to the light before the ascension of Christ, and then he does not connect his gift with the source of it, and is behind the testimony, or, knowing that he is an evangelist by gift from an ascended Christ refused on earth, he seeks to turn souls from "darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they might receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me"; that is, in a glorified Christ.<a name=2:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		If the salvation of the perishing soul be the one end before the mind, then the beginning and every part of the evangelist's services more or less express this end.<a name=3:1></a> But if Christ, and being united to Him in glory be the end, (as it assuredly must be when the evangelist knows that he has been sent by a Saviour ascended to God's right hand, to preach the good tidings of His finished work,) then the beginning and every part of his work bears the stamp and colour of this truth, and souls who receive his message are enlightened accordingly.<a name=3:2></a> If the evangelist derives his gift from an ascended Christ, surely if he keep this one simple thing honestly before him, he must study the mind of his ascended Lord and look for souls here who will believe in an ascended Christ, and in believing receive the Spirit who unites them to Him now absent.<a name=3:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The assembly came in consequent on the rejection of Christ, at first indirectly though surely; that is, while there was an offer to Israel of the Lord in glory in the earlier chapters of the Acts, up to the stoning of Stephen, yet all the time the assembly was the only one true gathering point.<a name=3:4></a>

		Saints now are baptized by one Spirit into one body; the weakest member is necessary, and the safety of the soul is not the <i>end</i> of the gospel now, but that believers should be united to Christ the Head in heaven, and to one another on earth by the Holy Spirit.<a name=3:5></a> It is of immense practical import whether the evangelist apprehends what is the mind of his Lord in conferring on him the gift of an evangelist; because however earnest and faithful he might be, he cannot do his duty to souls, or please the Lord otherwise.<a name=3:6></a> If he in his own heart limits the end and finish of his work to the salvation of the soul, he cannot seek for anything beyond, until the limit in his mind be altered.<a name=3:7></a> If the preacher in knowledge and purpose be not beyond remission of sins, there may be converts as there were at Ephesus, where they had not advanced beyond Apollos who had preached to them, "knowing only the

		It is impossible to separate from the world unless one knows what it is to be heavenly.<a name=4:9></a> Nothing can divert the heart from the earthly side of things but the Spirit of God leading it into association with Christ where He is.<a name=4:10></a> It is not to a believers' meeting that we go to look for it, nor a meeting of any kind however rightly constituted.<a name=4:11></a> If the heart has found its true bond to Christ, it will soon find the right meeting or way of meeting.<a name=4:12></a> Often the question of hell or heaven is settled for the future, when the question, Is it earth or heaven now?<a name=4:13></a> has never been raised; and the real reason, let servants fail to see it as they may, why there are so many advocates for the gospel without the assembly is this, that you can hold on with the world and in an earthly position and pursuits, and still earnestly seek to save souls from hell, which could in no way be done if your aim were to connect them with

		THE CAUSES OF DIFFERENCE OF OPINION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first and greatest desire of our Lord for His disciples on earth, was that they should be one after the same manner of unity as exists between Himself and the Father.<a name=6:1></a> The oneness of all saints in mind and judgment would have been the most impressive evidence to the world; hence He says, "that the world may believe that thou hast sent me".<a name=6:2></a> Nothing could so much arrest, and tend to convince the mass of men in general, as the astounding, novel, unheard-of fact, that one mind and judgment was maintained by all believers in Christ; there could be no greater evidence that the one God ruled and guided each; that man with all his peculiar feelings and self-concentration had given way, and that one holy, comprehensive mind and judgment directed and governed each and all.<a name=6:3></a> The old saying, 'every man for himself', is entirely contravened by the great truth that the saints should be perfectly joined together in the same mind and the same judgment.<a name=6:4></a> It is plain that with God there cannot be two opinions about anything, and therefore if there be difference of opinion in men, there must be a departure from the divine mind on either side, or, as is oftener the case, on both sides.<a name=6:5></a> It is therefore a very grave thing to differ in opinion from a saint, for it must be either that I am advocating what is not of God, or that he is.<a name=6:6></a> There should not be such a thing as agreeing to differ, though there may be a tolerance of difference of judgment.<a name=6:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Once it is admitted that it is the natural mind in us which hinders the true and clear acceptance of God's mind, there is at least an opportunity afforded for exercising oneself before the Lord as to the correctness of one's views and opinions.<a name=6:8></a> We learn from <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>that we are either of the world or of the Father.<a name=6:9></a> If we are of the Father our opinions must be in perfect harmony; no one could see <i>differently</i> from another;

		some might see <i>more</i> than others, but all would see in the same direction.<a name=7:1></a> There may be different sizes of the same kind of tree, but that is quite another thing to there being different trees with different ways and rules of growth, etc.<a name=7:2></a> If we had no judgment of our own, and if our minds were like a tablet on which nothing was ever written, and on which nothing could be written but the word of God, we could not have any mind but the mind of the Lord; and this is the great end of the Scriptures; it is not merely that they give us light about certain things, but they form us into the mind of God about everything.<a name=7:3></a> You will never find that you learn the Lord's mind from any number of subjects which you may have studied in the Scriptures; you must study the revelation of God as one whole, and as you take it in, your mind begins to regard things as He does.<a name=7:4></a> Isolated subjects or doctrines to any extent can only inform you respecting themselves, and though quite necessary they are of comparatively small moment to the great importance of being in the current of God's judgment about everything; and this wondrous favour you can only obtain, by getting a full apprehension, if not comprehension, of all the revelation which He has been pleased to give us.<a name=7:5></a> A student of geography must learn the globe before he can determine the latitude of any particular country, so must the christian student learn the scope and intent of the Bible, before he can truly and fully define particular subjects or doctrines.<a name=7:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There are, I may say, four causes for the difference of opinion which, alas, is so wide-spread among us, and so humbling to us all.<a name=7:7></a> What can be a more humiliating picture than to see members of the one body, each of whom is a temple of the Holy Spirit, holding and advocating with all the earnestness of their abilities, opinions directly at variance with one another?<a name=7:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first cause is ignorance.<a name=7:9></a> I think many are not sufficiently enlightened as to the word of God so as to be able to see or to accept what others see to be positively

	<div class="paragraph">
		revealed.<a name=8:1></a> Thomas is an instance of ignorance when he said, "We know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?<a name=8:2></a>" Nicodemus was ignorant; the eunuch was ignorant, and Apollos was ignorant.<a name=8:3></a> There is one distinct mark about one who is simply ignorant, and that is, he likes to be informed, and is really receptive; in those cases, and I suppose in every case where there is a sense of ignorance, light is in mercy supplied through some means.<a name=8:4></a> Mere ignorance, where there is not will, is no hindrance to the Spirit of God; hence the apostle says, "Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you", <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3:15">Philippians  3:15</a>.<a name=8:5></a> Many are ignorant now of dispensational truth, and they argue that what was approved of by God at one time for His people is consistent for the present time; and surely nothing could cause a greater difference of opinion than darkness as to the varied dispensations from Adam downwards in contrast with a clear apprehension of them.<a name=8:6></a> One sincere believer will argue for war and earthly glory because David was a great soldier and a mighty king, whereas another, who sees the rejection of the King of kings, will know that all man's glory has passed away and that the only true greatness now is through the Spirit of God.<a name=8:7></a> The difference of opinion between two who hold to each of these creeds, must be so wide, so opposed, that there could be no point of agreement anywhere.<a name=8:8></a> They differ so essentially that everything said or done bears the mark of the difference, and yet the mass of believers is in this ignorance of dispensational truth at this present moment.<a name=8:9></a> The rejection of Christ is not seen, and there are very few who really and simply see the present period to be characteristically the assembly period; they do not deny the assembly, but they do not see that it was formed and disclosed consequent on the rejection of Christ by man upon earth, so that the assembly must be characteristically heavenly and not earthly.<a name=8:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=9>[Page 9]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the reason why this ignorance is not enlightened and corrected is, that with the mass it is not simply ignorance as it was with Nicodemus, Thomas, or Mary Magdalene; it has grown into <i>prejudice</i>, which is another cause for the difference of opinion.<a name=9:1></a> Prejudice springs from being educated in a religious system.<a name=9:2></a> The conscience has been under the conviction that it is subject to the only true religion, and hence, the nearer the religion comes to the truth in external form and ceremony, the more difficult it is to free the conscience of that bias which I call prejudice.<a name=9:3></a> It is an immense thing to liberate the conscience from any religious imposition or ordinance founded on the authority of God's word.<a name=9:4></a> This was the prejudice of the Jews, and it ruled them to such an extent that they thought they did God service in killing the christians.<a name=9:5></a> "They have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge".<a name=9:6></a> It is not merely the details of a religion which it is difficult to eradicate, but whatever has laid hold of the conscience as a special claim, is clung to with tenacity.<a name=9:7></a> And thus it is with believers; what circumcision was to the Jews, so to many christians at this moment is the law, as the rule of life, as well as the two ordinances, baptism and the Lord's supper, in various modes of administration.<a name=9:8></a> Prejudice judges everything, even the word of God, in the light of the religious dogma which governs the conscience, and there is no breaking down prejudice but by really setting aside man in death.<a name=9:9></a> Hence the apostle Paul, a man of the greatest prejudice - one who could say "after the .<a name=9:10></a>.<a name=9:11></a> .<a name=9:12></a> straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee" - was called out to be the witness in divine power of complete superiority over all prejudices.<a name=9:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The third cause is <i>expediency</i>.<a name=9:14></a> This often occurs where there is neither ignorance nor prejudice, and simply arises from looking at things in relation to man instead of in relation to God.<a name=9:15></a> James from expediency pressed and induced Paul to show his zeal for the law, <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#21:20">Acts  21:20</a>.<a name=9:16></a> Usefulness is generally grounded on expediency, which
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=10>[Page 10]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		urges the claim of need, apart from the mind and pleasure of the Lord.<a name=10:1></a> This was Martha's mistake, her work was a useful and a necessary one seeing as man sees; but she consulted her own mind and not the Lord's.<a name=10:2></a> It is amazing the divergence of opinion which must exist between a Martha and a Mary; the more expedient the thing seems to be, the more difficult it is to renounce it for the word of God.<a name=10:3></a> Nothing seemed more natural than that David, sitting in his own house of cedars, should want to build a house for the Lord; and though it was good that it was in his heart, yet the word of the Lord countermanded it.<a name=10:4></a> It would be as difficult to effect an agreement between the man of expediency and the man of faith who is simply led by the word, as to make a man looking eastward see what the man looking westward sees.<a name=10:5></a> The man of expediency can always reason well, and has plenty of evidence to establish his argument.<a name=10:6></a> The man of faith sees what God says, and waits in patience to fulfil His mind, but there can be no oneness of judgment between them.<a name=10:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The last cause whereby the mind is warped and hindered from judging according to God is <i>covetousness</i>.<a name=10:8></a> Covetousness is desiring something for one's own gratification.<a name=10:9></a> There is the idol in the heart, and all truth is qualified or reduced in order to spare this idol or taste.<a name=10:10></a> We find in <a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#14:4">Ezekiel  14:4</a>, "Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumbling-block of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I the Lord will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols".<a name=10:11></a> If I come simply to the word of God I shall always find that the thing which most hinders me is the one which the word most rebukes; but if I am determined at all cost to save my idol, whatever it be, I must limit the action of the word, and this limitation will inevitably run through every subject in the word which I take up.<a name=10:12></a> Have we not discovered how differently and boldly we insist on a passage, when a covetous course has been surrendered,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=11>[Page 11]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		which was garbled and glossed over formerly?<a name=11:1></a> The covetous man not only differs from the fearless asserter of the full truth, but he shuns the teacher, as the Galatians and all that were in Asia shunned Paul.<a name=11:2></a> There is always a twofold action of the word of God; one is deepening in your soul the truth you have truly and simply received, the other is correcting, and exposing either the working of the flesh in you, or its tendency; and when the heart is simple it likes both; and thus it is led into the mind of the Lord, and all who are so must have the same mind and the same judgment.<a name=11:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		May the Lord exercise our hearts and consciences, that we may not be harbouring anything which is a hindrance to oneness of mind and judgment, for His name's sake.<a name=11:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		THE UNSEEN POWER
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The power of man became distinct and disconnected from the power of God the moment Eve, urged on by her own will, put forth her hand in selfishness to take of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.<a name=11:5></a> There were then three powers on the earth; the power of God, the power of Satan, and the power of man.<a name=11:6></a> The power of God acting when and how it listeth; the power of Satan limited to evil; and the power of man defined by his own natural strength unless he became the agent of either of the other two.<a name=11:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus man on the earth was continually reminded of his powerless condition, - and his end, death, was the crown of it.<a name=11:8></a> And as he became conscious of his powerlessness, (for his mind gave him a station beyond his means to support,) he in unbelief had recourse to Satan, who in malice was ever ready to help him to do evil.<a name=11:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		No man intentionally, unless very debased, could turn to Satan for help; but Satan, knowing the helplessness of man, had provided expedients, which would allure him in the hour of difficulty or temptation.<a name=11:10></a> Witchcraft and everything of that class were the devices by which Satan
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=12>[Page 12]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		allured man in the hour of his impotence to turn to him while to the degraded man he came, and offered to help him to accomplish his evil purposes by entering into him.<a name=12:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When God set up man again upon the earth (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#9">Genesis  9</a>), He gave him an increased power which I may call the sword, because it was to control; there was nothing of the ascending character in it.<a name=12:2></a> At any rate this new power is confined to man and all below him; it does not bring him nearer to God, while, if used for himself, it has the effect of making him more independent of God.<a name=12:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There was always in the converted soul another power, the power of faith; and this power preserved a line of its own witnesses.<a name=12:4></a> Abraham was a witness of it.<a name=12:5></a> And often we find that the power of government, and the power of faith, or the unseen power, were vested in one and the same person, as in Joseph, Samuel, or David.<a name=12:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There were, all through man's time - the old dispensation - wonderful instances of the actings of the unseen power.<a name=12:7></a> Eve built; Enoch translated; Babel confounded; the judgments executed on Egypt; the deliverance of Israel from Egypt; the way made through the Red Sea; the passage of Jordan; the preservation of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego in the midst of the fiery furnace: the history of the returned captives; and many other instances too numerous to recount.<a name=12:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus there was the power of Satan to do evil, and exercised in that line only.<a name=12:9></a> There was the natural power of man, and the sword given to him by God in order to subdue and to maintain order.<a name=12:10></a> And there was the unseen power of God working through faith in the souls of men.<a name=12:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, as to the power of Satan, no one would admit that he was under it.<a name=12:12></a> Alas!<a name=12:13></a> we know that many are; but it is not a power which any one would willingly boast of.<a name=12:14></a> But the power which God gave man in order to subdue and to rule is, on the contrary, one which every natural man covets, and more or less seeks for.<a name=12:15></a> God often did, as I have said, connect faith - His own power - with the same person in whose hands He had placed the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		sword.<a name=13:1></a> But at the captivity of Israel the sword, in judgment on Israel, was handed over to the gentiles; and hence, subsequently, the only true power of the godly remnant was the unseen power - faith reckoning upon God, like Daniel in the lions' den, etc.<a name=13:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now when Christ came, there was the power of Satan as it had been from the first; the sword was in the hands of the Romans; the Jews had the oracles of God and were in their own land, but having forfeited the sword they were powerless unless they had faith in God.<a name=13:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Man Christ Jesus was the wondrous perfect expression of the unseen power of God in Israel, when they had no other power unless Satan's, by which they were afflicted; and they were ruled over by the power of the sword in the hand of the Romans.<a name=13:4></a> He was anointed with the Holy Spirit and with power, and went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil, for God was with Him.<a name=13:5></a> He was the first Man in whom the Holy Spirit abode, as it was said to John Baptist: "Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, he it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit".<a name=13:6></a> This was what would specially mark Him:

		On the other hand, with the increase of knowledge of the text of Scripture, there is great danger of giving a conscientious assent to the standing, particularly when insisted on by those really enjoying it, without a due sense of the state which the standing entails.<a name=30:7></a> This danger is to be chiefly apprehended, when the acceptance of the standing has relieved the heart of legal efforts to reach it, for then a delightful sense is made known to the soul; the standing that I pined after is discovered to be really <i>mine</i>, by the grace of God, and I enjoy for the moment unspeakable joy.<a name=30:8></a> I had been struggling in vain to reach it by seeking to have a state worthy of it; but after having found that the standing is mine, independently of my efforts, if I in any degree become indifferent about my state, and base my happiness and power on the bare fact of having ascertained my standing, I shall find ere long that I am nothing better than a miser, with means for a great position, but from want of making proper use of them, really worse off than I was when labouring to acquire them, and I am an object of mingled pity and reproach.<a name=30:9></a>

		The mind of Christ is the new creation, and this is not helped by the natural mind, but by the Spirit of God; hence the mind of Christ will judge wisely for a saint, even as to natural things, and better than the natural mind, which will judge quite in a different way, and not at all according to the mind of the Lord.<a name=33:5></a> Thus there is a double gain when I am led by the Spirit of Christ; I can then judge of things for man in the smallest detail, as God has ordered them for him, whereas the greatest natural intellect can at best judge for him only in relation to himself as man.<a name=33:6></a>

		The great proof of maturity is that a habit has been acquired of exercising the senses to discern good and evil; there is the consciousness that there is a rivalry; - "the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would", - that you may be superior to the flesh.<a name=33:7></a>

		This class is the most numerous, and the most difficult to convince of their mistake, for almost everyone, even Satan, endeavours to have a scriptural authority for his view of things.<a name=34:4></a> They assert they have authority from Scripture for what they desire, and even the desire they may have acquired in a natural way from the Scriptures.<a name=34:5></a> Eve is an example of this; she interprets the promise that her seed should bruise the serpent's head in a natural way, merely referring it to herself, and therefore she concludes that her firstborn son is the man.<a name=34:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Naturally she had some ground for this interpretation, for if there were no ground for it, there would be no difficulty in disabusing the mind of it; but the ground is one that no one skilful in the word of righteousness would admit, even that a child of Adam fallen, could regain what Adam innocent had lost; that one under judgment like Cain, could effect his deliverance when his father, though in innocence and safety, was not able to retain the place in which God had set him.<a name=34:7></a>

		Others again do more than they are desired to do; they exceed the course prescribed by the word of the Lord; and this too is from the same cause, even that the natural mind is uncontrolled by the word of God, like Moses smiting the rock twice (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#15">Numbers  15</a>), or the demoniac in the gospel, who when told to go to his <i>own house</i> and show how great things God had done for him, went his way and published throughout the <i>whole city</i> how great things Jesus had done for him (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#8:39">Luke  8:39</a>).<a name=35:13></a>

		While every believer will admit his imperfection in practice, he generally considers himself correct in doctrine; he may own that he is ignorant of a great deal of truth, but his conscience would not be at ease if he did not think that he held what was true.<a name=36:4></a> Hence it is more difficult to convince a saint of his error in doctrine, than of his defect in practice.<a name=36:5></a>

		There cannot be correct practice with an assured conscience, but as there is correct doctrine.<a name=36:6></a> Once a saint is taught of God that he is heavenly as to calling, he may fail much in being practically heavenly, but as he knows the doctrine of his calling, he finds out that there is power given him according as he turns to the Lord to maintain his course as a heavenly saint.<a name=36:7></a>

		In the first great point of doctrine the heavenly saints and the earthly saints are together; the sins of both are washed away in the blood of the Lamb: this one great truth is common to both, and to every saint since the foundation of the world.<a name=36:8></a>

		or earthly line, and not in the ascending or heavenly.<a name=37:1></a> That is to say, the calling and blessing of the heavenly saint are brought down to the line of the earthly.<a name=37:2></a> Now in the very terms earthly and heavenly there is an immense distinction involved; and the rest is easily learned when once this great distinction is admitted.<a name=37:3></a> The real difficulty lies in convincing saints of the fact that they <i>are</i> heavenly in the true sense of the term.<a name=37:4></a> Christians acknowledge it in a general way, because they know that heaven will eventually be their abode, but no one can see the heavenly standing who does not see that Christ being rejected from the earth, the saint, if united to Him now, must be united to Him in heaven where He is; and that if not united to Him there, he has no link to Christ absent, although he is absolved from his sins by the blood of Christ.<a name=37:5></a> Moreover he is on the earth where Christ is not ruling, (for He must come before He reigns,) so that the portion of a saint now, if he were not united to Christ in heaven, would be infinitely worse than that of a saint in the millennium.<a name=37:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The saint in the millennium will have the happy consciousness of Christ's rule over everything.<a name=37:7></a> Satan will be bound and Christ will order everything morally as the sun rules the day materially.<a name=37:8></a> Christ is now absent, and unless the Spirit of God unites the saint to Him in heaven where He is, it is evident he is on the earth in a worse position than the earthly saint.<a name=37:9></a> But the saint now is united by the Spirit to Christ, and as he belongs to a heavenly Christ, he is on his way to heaven as his own place, even though he still be on the earth.<a name=37:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I am not now stating the various doctrines which distinguish and peculiarly belong to the heavenly saint; I am seeking to establish the fact that a saint is now heavenly both as to standing and hope, because he is united to Christ in heaven, and that the one great difference between an earthly saint and a heavenly one is, that the earthly one will not be united to Christ in heaven, but will be on the earth when the Lord reigns.<a name=37:11></a> The Lord

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The difference between this present time and the millennium is very distinct.<a name=38:3></a> The Lord is not reigning now, but He will reign then.<a name=38:4></a> The saint now is joined to the Lord, and is one spirit with Him.<a name=38:5></a> This embraces a great deal, and if this point of difference be really and truly admitted, all the others will follow as a consequence.<a name=38:6></a> If I am united to Christ, He is my life; "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death".<a name=38:7></a> I am not only born again, which is true of every saint (see <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:3">John  3:3</a> - 12), but I am enjoying another life through the Holy Spirit, and this could not be without distinct and positive deliverance from the man in the flesh, so that "the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me".<a name=38:8></a> Here I am dead, and my life is hid with Christ in God.<a name=38:9></a> The earthly saint lives here on earth, he is not united to Christ, he is not dead, he is a man living in all the commandments and ordinances of the law blameless.<a name=38:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As united to Christ, I have Christ living in me.<a name=38:11></a> I am to live in Him who is not here in the place where He is not, but in order that I may be able to do this, I am united to Him where He is.<a name=38:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This then is a great difference - the heavenly saint has a perfect sense of complete deliverance from the man in the flesh; while the millennial saint is through grace empowered to do what God required of a man in the flesh.<a name=38:13></a> "I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#8:10">Hebrews  8:10</a>.<a name=38:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The heavenly saint is not below this in walk, but he is greatly beyond it, and if he be not, he is, as I have said, worse off than a millennial saint, because he is now where Christ is not present, nor reigning.<a name=38:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, the way into the holiest of all is now made manifest.<a name=39:1></a> We - the heavenly saints - have "boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh".<a name=39:2></a> The earthly saint, though cleansed from his sins by the blood, cannot speak of being inside the veil, because his economy or dispensation is connected with this earth.<a name=39:3></a> If we admit that our place as worshippers is inside the veil, we must admit another great difference between a heavenly and an earthly saint.<a name=39:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One more difference I would notice: the saint united to Christ in heaven, knowing perfect deliverance in Him, and worshipping in the holiest of all, has a place in heaven prepared for him by Christ, which the earthly saint could never speak of.<a name=39:5></a> True he can speak of knowing the Lord of heaven and earth, and eventually he will be in the new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness, when all things are made new; but he cannot speak of having a place prepared for him in the Father's house, and still less can he speak of being raised up together with Christ now, and made to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.<a name=39:6></a> Thus we see there are four great differences in doctrine between the heavenly and the earthly saint - first, the connection with Christ is different, the saints during His rejection being united to Him, a privilege not known by, or granted to, any other class of saints, neither to the saints before His first advent, nor to the saints after His return.<a name=39:7></a> Secondly, the deliverance is different because the saints united to Him are in Him, and He is their life.<a name=39:8></a> Thirdly, the worship is different; the saint in perfect deliverance is inside the veil; and lastly, while the saints before the coming of Christ looked forward to a prospect of a heaven - they "looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God" - the saint at this time, not only knows that Jesus has prepared a place for him in heaven, but he knows too, that by the

		Spirit of God he is there, in Him through faith; now, with regard to the millennial saint, his hope and position are simply earthly.<a name=40:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we admit these differences between the three classes of saints (and I apprehend they cannot be denied), it is evident that any saint who now loses sight of his calling as a heavenly one, will be weak in his soul as to all these blessings which I have spoken of - namely, his union with Christ, his perfect deliverance, the true worship, and the place - the Canaan given him of God.<a name=40:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All the saints are set upon the earth, but each of the three classes is called to a very distinct and peculiar relation to it.<a name=40:3></a> The Old Testament saint found that the prospect of heaven was the relief from the confusion and evil here; the millennial saint will be able to enjoy everything here, because the power of evil will be restrained, and the Lord will reign.<a name=40:4></a> Hence it remains that the saints on the earth during the absence of Christ should not be of it, but having received greater blessings, should walk here during His absence, studying only to be like Him whom men refused and to be unlike those who refused Him.<a name=40:5></a> The snare is that because they are forgiven their sins and have been relieved of the fear of judgment, they turn to the earth, and expect favours from God in connection with it; and when they do, they practically surrender the great truths which distinguish them from the earthly saints, and they are necessarily low in practice because low in doctrine.<a name=40:6></a> They fail in testimony and are, according to the light and opportunity which they have not answered to, subjected to chastening; for "our God is a consuming fire", and His "jealousy is cruel as the grave".<a name=40:7></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this is an influence which must ever address and ensnare the natural man; and hence faith in God, counting on Him who is invisible, was never connected with visible means; nay, it enabled the saint to act according to God, in spite of being opposed by the greatest visible means, thus showing that there was invisible power where there was no visible means; for visible means are a support to the possessor of them, and thus they take the place of faith.<a name=41:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In every instance we see that when faith works, it is independent of visible means.<a name=41:8></a> Abram is called to break with all visible supports, and to come into the "land that I will shew thee".<a name=41:9></a> "And he went out, not knowing whither he went".<a name=41:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		No one will deny that faith acts independently of means; but what I desire to show is, that visible means <i>hinder</i> faith, when possessed and used by the saint; though, to the man of faith, they are as nothing, when in the hands of his opponent.<a name=41:11></a> The green fields of Sodom met the eye of Lot, when he turned from faith.<a name=41:12></a> The visible becomes the ready support and attraction of the heart that drops from faith.<a name=41:13></a> The difficulty is to be

		At all events, at our Lord's death, the question of visible means, and of invisible power, was settled for every awakened soul.<a name=43:6></a> Man and all his force was against Christ, and it appeared to succeed according to his evil purpose, but God triumphed over it all, and secured eternal blessings for man, while he betrayed his full evil and venom in directing all the means given him of God to put His Son to death.<a name=43:7></a> This culminating act of man's evil ought to teach us how the power God gave man is subject to man, and used by him for the worst purposes.<a name=43:8></a> It was given to Noah to repress evil, and now man has disqualified himself for ever from holding power, seeing that he has used all he had, to crucify the Son of God.<a name=43:9></a>

		Next, when we turn to the scene of Stephen's martyrdom, we see how all visible forces were directed against him in vain.<a name=43:10></a> Apparently he was left unsupported and friendless, and yet never was any man more sustained by the invisible power; "being full of the Holy Spirit, having fixed his eyes on heaven, he saw the glory of God, and Jesus".<a name=43:11></a> He is at ease in the heavenly glory.<a name=43:12></a> Neither the gnashing of the teeth of the solemn council - the great religious conclave - nor the pain inflicted by the stoning of his body, in the least overcame him; he was not only tranquil and composed, but able to act for others.<a name=43:13></a> He knelt down and prayed for them, so superior was he to all their fierce combination.<a name=43:14></a>

		If we study the life and ways of the apostle Paul who was at once the greatest of evangelists and of teachers, we see that while the highest and deepest truth was committed to him, so that he could say, "Thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in the Christ, and makes manifest the odour of his knowledge through us in every place"; yet he was deeply exercised about those who had received the light from him, either for conversion or growth.<a name=48:2></a> He says, "I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears".<a name=48:3></a> These were saints who were brought to the knowledge of the Lord through his ministry.<a name=48:4></a> And to the Colossians whom he had never seen he writes, "For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh", <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:1">Colossians  2:1</a>.<a name=48:5></a> He had previously stated as to himself, "Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church", <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:24">Colossians  1:24</a>.<a name=48:6></a> And again to Timothy he writes from the prison at Rome, "I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory", <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:10">2 Timothy  2:10</a>.<a name=48:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we see that, whether as an evangelist or teacher, his service did not end with being blessed to souls in the communication of the truth, but that he followed with a devoted interest every believing soul as a nurse would, and was not content with being a father.<a name=48:8></a>

		could have so deep and full a sense of its gravity and magnificence; and yet no one else felt more keenly the perverse soil of the human heart.<a name=49:1></a> He - the Son of man, was the Sower of the seed.<a name=49:2></a> Everything perfect was offered to man by the Holy One of God; but man saw no beauty in Him.<a name=49:3></a> He was charged with everything on God's side to impart profound and increasing delight to Him in His mission to ruined creatures sunk in darkness and misery.<a name=49:4></a> He had everything in abundance to meet their need.<a name=49:5></a> On that side His joy was unspeakable, and yet He was "a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief".<a name=49:6></a> "He hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows".<a name=49:7></a> His "visage was so marred more than any man", at death.<a name=49:8></a> "He groaned in the spirit, and was troubled".<a name=49:9></a> He wept with the sorrowing Mary.<a name=49:10></a> When He beheld Jerusalem He wept over it.<a name=49:11></a> He not only loved the assembly and gave Himself for it, but it is said, "No one has ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as also the Christ the assembly".<a name=49:12></a> He proves His love by washing our feet.<a name=49:13></a> His unceasing occupation as our Saviour, Intercessor, is to sanctify and cleanse us with the washing of water by the word.<a name=49:14></a> And when failure and corruption were found in the assembly, He adopts, as we see in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:3">Revelation  1:3</a>, the aspect suited to correct and judge it.<a name=49:15></a> In all its failure and declension; after all His unequalled services to it; after conferring the greatest gift - the gift of the Holy Spirit; the assembly is still the centre of His thoughts and services.<a name=49:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we see in the history of every servant, and most of all in that of the Lord Himself, that the true servant becomes charged with the state and condition of those who receive the word of the Lord from his lips; and that he cannot confine himself to the happy side of his work, which is that of being appointed and gifted of the Lord to bless souls; but that the more he walks with the Lord in the exercise of his gift, the more will his heart be exercised by the state of those who bear His name.<a name=49:17></a> I am not pressing that a servant should look for results in the

		form of conversions or pupils; this I believe he should leave to the Lord.<a name=50:1></a> It is not that the actual result of work should either cheer or depress; but the manner and the effect of the truth which he has received of the Lord, and has been the channel of communicating will, I believe, produce deep exercise of heart in him, in proportion to the truth and reality of his service.<a name=50:2></a> Paul could say, "As a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation .<a name=50:3></a>.<a name=50:4></a>.<a name=50:5></a> let every man <i>take heed</i> how he buildeth thereupon".<a name=50:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is incompatible with all divine service that a servant should be merely an orb of light, like the sun or stars, communicating much, but passive and unaffected by the condition of those to whom he has imparted light - with no feeling of care or charge, respecting those whom he has served.<a name=50:7></a> The attempt to be a servant like an orb of light merely, is really to appropriate all the joy and gratification of ministry, without enduring the afflictions of the gospel, or being weighted with the condition of the saints.<a name=50:8></a> It really limits the truth and light to its benefit to man, irrespective of what is due to God for so great a revelation.<a name=50:9></a> The return due to God is overlooked and disregarded; and a servant of this kind can never be deeply taught in the mind of the Lord; for he does not in any measure fulfil that which is behind of the sufferings of Christ; he knows nothing of the Lord's feelings when He wept over Jerusalem, or of Jeremiah's, when he exclaimed, "Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!<a name=50:10></a>".<a name=50:11></a> He has not on his forehead the mark of the men who "sigh and .<a name=50:12></a>.<a name=50:13></a>.<a name=50:14></a> cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst" of Jerusalem; and he fails in his own soul to taste of the heart of our blessed Lord, who with inconceivable light and power, is ever increasingly interested in, and intent on serving those who believe in His name.<a name=50:15></a>

		It was on the redemption of Israel out of Egypt that was formed for the first time a habitation for God on the earth.<a name=51:1></a> On no other ground but that of redemption could this have been.<a name=51:2></a> It has been said that God did not dwell with Adam, nor with Abraham, for He could not dwell with man save on the ground of redemption.<a name=51:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The holiest of all was the place of His abode, first in the tabernacle, and afterwards in the temple.<a name=51:4></a> The retirement of the glory from the earth was consequent on the persistent rebellion, and open apostasy of Israel; yet our blessed Lord called the temple, "My Father's house", <a href="../bible/John.htm#2">John  2</a>.<a name=51:5></a> And even after the descent of the Holy Spirit the apostles repaired to it, as the place bearing the name of God, as we find in the beginning of the Acts.<a name=51:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The more we study the history of the "house", the more do we see how much it was in the mind of God to have a dwelling place upon the earth, and what an object of interest it was to Him.<a name=51:7></a> On the return of the captivity, the first work of Ezra was the resuscitation of the temple, and when they discontinued that work on account of the opposition to it, they lost all their blessing, "because of mine house that is waste".<a name=51:8></a> The house was an institution; for even after the glory had departed, it was still owned of God, and had a claim upon His people.<a name=51:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We must bear in mind God's intention in having a habitation for Himself on the earth; and that, once it was set up, although the greatest distinction which had attached to it was lost when the glory retired, yet it still retained the title of His house - "the place where thine honour dwelleth", until it was superseded by something greater.<a name=51:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I need not say that the house which He dwelt in among Israel is now superseded by the assembly, which is the habitation of God through the Spirit; and which has remained His house, in spite of all the failure and

		<a name=52>[Page 52]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		rebellion of His professed people.<a name=52:1></a> The Spirit of God is still here.<a name=52:2></a> The habitation has been of old, ever since redemption was actually effected for God's people out of judgment.<a name=52:3></a> At first it was distinguished by the visible presence of the glory of God - a pillar of cloud by day, and a pillar of fire by night.<a name=52:4></a> Afterwards the glory found its abode in the holiest of all; but even after the glory was withdrawn on account of the people's apostasy, God still claimed the house as His, and our Lord, as we have seen, called it "my Father's house".<a name=52:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the habitation still continues, but in a new and greater way, for it is by the presence of the Holy Spirit upon earth that God has a habitation here, and this has gone on through all the ages of darkness and ignorance, even while hardly any of the saints understood or sought for the presence of Christ.<a name=52:6></a> It is evident that the Holy Spirit has not retired from the earth, for where any divine work is, there the Spirit of God must be.<a name=52:7></a> This every one would admit.<a name=52:8></a> But there is more than this; what we have to accept is, that the Spirit of God has come down to earth consequent on the ascension of Christ.<a name=52:9></a> The Comforter - the Holy Spirit - was sent down from heaven for a two-fold service.<a name=52:10></a> One, as we read in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:26">John  14:26</a>, to be an abiding comfort and reminder of Christ to the believer, and the other, as we read in <a href="../bible/John.htm#15:26">John  15:26</a>, to testify of Christ during His absence.<a name=52:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a different order in each of these as to His mission.<a name=52:12></a> In the one for the saint, He is sent by the Father.<a name=52:13></a> In the one for testimony, He is sent by Christ.<a name=52:14></a>

		Now the simple fact for faith is, that the Holy Spirit has been sent from heaven.<a name=52:15></a> When He first came down (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>), He filled the place where they were, and also in a particular manner rested on each of them.<a name=52:16></a> The baptism of the Holy Spirit was a continual fact, and one not to be discontinued nor withdrawn as long as the assembly was God's habitation.<a name=52:17></a> When it is spued out of Christ's mouth, it is no longer the dwelling-place of God; but until then, however feeble, or ignorant, or degraded,

		as was the case with the assembly of Laodicea, the Holy Spirit is still there, constituting it God's habitation.<a name=53:1></a> The presence of the Holy Spirit on earth then is continual, and does not depend on the extent by which He is received by the saints.<a name=53:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Holy Spirit had been sent from heaven even though the Ephesian saints had neither received Him nor heard of Him.<a name=53:3></a> (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#19">Acts  19</a>).<a name=53:4></a> So that we must admit that, while every converted soul is quickened by the Holy Spirit, still His presence is here - dwelling on the earth, even when not dwelling in the souls of all the saints.<a name=53:5></a> It was so at Ephesus.<a name=53:6></a> The presence of the Holy Spirit was on earth but He was not dwelling in any of them, though they were all quickened by Him.<a name=53:7></a> I am not contending for the length of interval which may or may not elapse between quickening and sealing, or the indwelling of the Spirit, but I contend that it is clear from Scripture that each is a distinct operation of the Spirit of God, and therefore not one and the same, but two operations.<a name=53:8></a> Were it otherwise, the presence of the Holy Spirit on earth would be only according to the measure in which He had been received by the saints: and hence He would not have been sent down at Ephesus, because there the converts had neither heard of Him nor received Him.<a name=53:9></a> I fully admit that it is the right and privilege of every saint to be indwelt by the Spirit of God; but what I state is the distinction between the new bottle and the new wine.<a name=53:10></a> One is the building of the Spirit of God, and the other is His indwelling; or, as has been said, the Holy Spirit first builds a house, and then dwells in it.<a name=53:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are these two things plainly set forth in Scripture.<a name=53:12></a> One, that the saint's body individually is the temple of the Holy Spirit; and the other, that the assembly is the temple of God; and this even though there be much corruption there, as there was at Corinth.<a name=53:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The presence of the Holy Spirit has continued in the assembly universal, and His presence cannot be measured or determined by the measure in which the saints have

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the presence of Christ is different.<a name=54:5></a> It is conditional; and therefore, instead of being continual, it is with regard to the assembly occasional.<a name=54:6></a> The Lord's words are, "For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them".<a name=54:7></a> There is evidently a condition here.<a name=54:8></a> It is only to the two or three gathered together unto His name that He promises His presence; and therefore His presence is not continual, as is the presence of the Holy Spirit, but occasional.<a name=54:9></a> I do not say it may not be continually repeated, but though it can be known only through the Holy Spirit, it is not the same as the abiding presence of the Holy Spirit in the assembly.<a name=54:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now when corruption came to be tolerated in the assembly when it became like a "great house" (see <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2">2 Timothy  2</a>), and in it "vessels .<a name=54:11></a>.<a name=54:12></a>.<a name=54:13></a> to dishonour" (it has grown into this condition, because leaven was tolerated until the whole was leavened), there was no recovery for the whole, the glory we might say had departed.<a name=54:14></a> At first, on the occurrence and incursion of evil, the Holy Spirit's presence was insisted on, as Peter says to Ananias (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#5">Acts  5</a>), "Why has Satan filled thine heart that thou shouldest lie to the Holy Spirit?<a name=54:15></a>" Paul instructs the Corinthians how they are to get rid of the evil-doer among them, (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5">1 Corinthians  5</a>) "In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ".<a name=54:16></a> In the first case, the Holy Spirit's presence is the ground for unsparing condemnation; in the second, the power of Christ's presence is the only means given for putting away an evil person.<a name=54:17></a> The difference between the Holy Spirit's presence and the presence of Christ cannot be

		denied; the former is not conditional, the latter is.<a name=55:1></a> But it is evident that no one could know or enjoy the presence of Christ who did not know and enjoy the presence of the Holy Spirit; though again, the Holy Spirit can dwell in a soul, and yet that soul be debarred for the time from the enjoyment of the presence of Christ.<a name=55:2></a> It is written, "Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption".<a name=55:3></a> This shews that the soul does not lose its great Guest, but that He can be grieved.<a name=55:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But Christ does not promise His presence to us individually unless we keep His commandments (see <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:21">John  14:21</a>,23); that is, unless I am walking according to His mind, He will not manifest Himself to me.<a name=55:5></a> I do not lose the seal of the Holy Spirit because I grieve Him (though I lose His communication to me of Christ); but I forfeit the presence of Christ when I decline in any degree from His word.<a name=55:6></a> Otherwise He would sanction by His presence my own ways.<a name=55:7></a> And He is not in our midst collectively unless we are gathered together unto His name.<a name=55:8></a> It is not that two or three do it in a company, but that the assembly is gathered on this <i>avowed</i> ground.<a name=55:9></a> Many in it might fail to be there according to their avowed principle, but He would be in the midst for those who in faith counted on Him, and waited for the fulfilment of His word.<a name=55:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a difference in manner in the presence of Christ to the assembly, and the presence of Christ to the individual.<a name=55:11></a> In the former it is in the midst of them, as in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:19">John  20:19</a> and <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24">Luke  24</a>; but to the individual, it is as to Paul, when he could say, "The Lord stood with me", <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#4:17">2 Timothy  4:17</a>.<a name=55:12></a> It is the known sense of His presence beside one.<a name=55:13></a>

		In conclusion, the presence of the Holy Spirit is general in the assembly universal; the presence of Christ conditional, but could not be known apart from or independently of the presence of the Holy Spirit, who enables our hearts gathered unto the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, to recognize and greet Him in our midst, as

		Now it is a great relief to the upright heart to remember that guidance is promised by God to His people, and that while it is His part to guide, theirs only is to be guided: "I will.<a name=59:2></a>.<a name=59:3></a>.<a name=59:4></a> teach thee" and "guide thee with mine eye".<a name=59:5></a> "Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory".<a name=59:6></a> This is the part of God, and whether we are conscious or not conscious of His guidance, He will not fail in that which He has undertaken.<a name=59:7></a> Guidance is not necessarily <i>knowing</i> that we are guided, but it is <i>being guided</i> - "The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord" - and our business is to be in that state of soul in which He can lead us as the Father His children, though often by a way we know not.<a name=59:8></a> No doubt it is a happy and higher thing to be always so sensible of the movement of His eye and of His hand that all our ways may be ordered in communion with Him, but it is also blessed for the soul to be so sensible of self-judgment and self-renunciation, that the simple and happy heart can leave itself in His hands, and trust in His guidance as a matter of course.<a name=59:9></a> This delivers from bondage, and the legal state of so many, who are ever inquiring whether they are doing the right thing; while if the will is broken, the rule of a christian's life should be that he does not suspect he is doing the wrong one.<a name=59:10></a> Still it is well to mistrust self, and the consciousness of the will at work, and sift it before the Lord, though we may in the end discover that the thing desired is the very thing He would have us to do.<a name=59:11></a> In nearness to God we solve these questions, as our heart and will become more and more fashioned by His guidance, so will it be not merely by coincidence but by habit that God's will and ours are identical.<a name=59:12></a> If then both ourselves and our time are really at the Lord's disposal, we can leave it to Him to dispose of us as He sees good; doing that which the hand

	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle John sees the assembly on earth in seven phases, all existing at the time; but also each phase in succession becoming the characteristic one for the time; the four last remaining till the coming of the Lord.<a name=61:5></a> Philadelphia is one of these; as Thyatira sets forth Romanism, and Sardis, the reformed church, so-called, under every denomination, so does Philadelphia set forth the last revival in the assembly, when souls were awakened to the true calling of saints on earth, and were empowered to walk according to it.<a name=61:6></a> The assembly had long slumbered and slept, but when the cry came, there was an awakening.<a name=61:7></a> The last revival was, as has been always, that after all hope of restoration to the first state was impossible, there should be, though in great positional weakness, a reviving of the moral qualities which marked the first state.<a name=61:8></a> When the cry, "Behold, the bridegroom" awoke up the faithful, then, I conclude, Philadelphia in the characteristic phase began.<a name=61:9></a> The Lord then appears to the faithful, who seek Him in a threefold way, which together would afford guidance and support for souls awakened to His claim, in the midst of the ecclesiastical rules and prejudices almost sacred from antiquity.<a name=61:10></a> Those three were, I am "he that is holy, he that is true", and, I am "he that hath the key of David".<a name=61:11></a> The first two would impart the moral qualities, which would afford the awakened soul a clear path of escape from every association, and separation unto God; and this must unmistakably be the clue to get extricated from any

		Now those to whom this revelation of the Lord was vouchsafed, were marked by three things, "Because thou hast a little power, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name".<a name=62:5></a> These three qualities define a Philadelphian.<a name=62:6></a> The first I understand to flow from abiding in Christ, according to that word "Without me ye can do nothing".<a name=62:7></a> There is really no power apart from Christ; and hence, to have even a little power, is evidence of abiding in Christ.<a name=62:8></a> When the cry had been effective in awakening hearts to Christ, there was a practical result; there was not only a little power, but they held fast His word.<a name=62:9></a> The great and distinguishing mark of the last revival was the diligent and exclusive way the word was studied and held to; the marvellous revolution in thought and habit, which the simple adhering to the word brought about.<a name=62:10></a> The most cherished and ancient theologies were renounced, and the greatest self-sacrifices were incurred, in response to the word of God.<a name=62:11></a> A new and unprecedented course was insisted on, as the only one befitting the bride going forth to meet her Lord; and the aim was, that everything in public and in private should be subjected to a remodelling under the light which Scripture was now found to contain.<a name=62:12></a> Men eminent for piety, and leaders in religious communities, severed ties that were dearer than life, that they might obey the word of the Lord; and in private life, professions, positions, and prospects, were surrendered at its dictates, and because of simple faith in it.<a name=62:13></a> It was seen too that not only was the word to determine and define every course of action, but that all that would tend to deny the <i>name</i> - the character or manner of life of our Lord Jesus Christ, all that His name

		Now on tracing declension from this bright movement, the first step, as it appears to me, was the practical denial of the presence of the Holy Spirit to guide and direct in the assembly; and this was so serious, that had there not been a resistance, which ended in a distinct separation, there would now be but small trace of the truths which have been recovered.<a name=64:1></a> This leaven, though thus mercifully arrested, has insinuated and betrayed itself in another form.<a name=64:2></a> With the increase of numbers and of evangelists, the testimony took a more public character.<a name=64:3></a> Evangelization became more general, which disarmed many of the opponents, whose general taunt heretofore had been, Why do you disturb the minds of the godly by the propagation of your opinions, instead of preaching the gospel to the unconverted?<a name=64:4></a> Thus popular preaching led to popularity; and not only so, but to the desire for it; and human means, public notices, public rooms, were adopted to attract the public, and to obtain large assemblies, with a view to carrying on the work more effectually, but really departing from complete dependence on the Holy Spirit.<a name=64:5></a> An exciting mode of preaching was found more effective, and was resorted to and adopted, and this fostered a descent to a lower order of things for instruction, instead of a constant, and persevering seeking to reach, and to discover in its integrity and purity, the way and mode of the Spirit of God.<a name=64:6></a> The attention of servants became pre-eminently directed to gospel preaching, and the conversion of souls, instead of the more difficult work of enlightening saints as to their true place for Christ: and this, while it led to intercourse with worldly people, could be carried on with an allowance of worldly ways and habits, which the other could not; and the ear has become less sensitive to what the word simply enjoins.<a name=64:7></a> All this has popularised the advocates of truths lately recovered, and now much accepted; and once the nature of their mission became characteristically evangelical, and not ecclesiastical, there was consequently less scrutiny as to the nature of the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am very far from confining the declension to one class of service, or to one class of saints.<a name=65:2></a> I feel it has been a wave from which all have suffered; - and that the numerous additions, though there are many of them very bright and devoted, yet the bulk have accepted the ground in the light of the word, without being laid hold of, and formed by it.<a name=65:3></a> I speak of the servants as being most prominent, and necessarily most exposed to attack; and it cannot be denied, that while there are many most zealous and self-sacrificing evangelists, pastors and teachers have not kept pace with them in activity, nor have these gifts proportionally increased, or been developed.<a name=65:4></a> Now we are not to conclude because of their non-appearance, that they have not been given for the assembly.<a name=65:5></a> There is no lack of gift from the Head; but from lack of devotedness, the gift has not been disclosed and expressed.<a name=65:6></a> I am not condemning the zeal and activity of the evangelists, further than demonstrating that they in their zeal have had recourse to other means than the Spirit of God; and hence a tinge of the world clings to them in other ways.<a name=65:7></a> But I do think it is a great evidence of declension that there is not a corresponding zeal in pastors and teachers, and all servants, to shepherd and feed the flock of Christ, and separate them more from everything not of Him, to Himself in heart and spirit; and I venture to account for this last, by the simple fact that no pastor or teacher can sincerely attempt to expound or press the life and ways of Christ on others, beyond the measure in which he is truly seeking to be conformed to them himself.<a name=65:8></a> If he cannot avow that there is power and known power in Christ to separate a man from the world, in any particular instance, how can he effectually teach it?<a name=65:9></a> If a servant be a part of a system or machinery of the world by office, appointment, or voluntarily ministering unto it in some form, how can he freely and fully insist on uncompromising separation

		In conclusion, I would say that I believe Satan's aim and effort against us is to neutralize the effect of the great truth which has been revived in this day - the presence of the Holy Spirit.<a name=66:7></a> Baffled in his effort to get it denied, he then seeks to weaken its force in an insidious way.<a name=66:8></a> This I believe he has succeeded in doing amongst us, as to its practical power, though in point of doctrine it is fully acknowledged.<a name=66:9></a> But there is ever a tendency to separate the advantages of a truth from its responsibility; and so it is now.<a name=66:10></a> Many who rejoice in the truth of the indwelling Spirit, for their own comfort, are not alive to the responsibility which His presence on earth in testimony for Christ involves.<a name=66:11></a>

		Next to the salvation of our souls, through the work of our Lord Jesus Christ, there is nothing greater than that we should be individually temples of the Holy Spirit; for His dwelling in us is the seal of our faith in Christ, confirming and assuring what has been received.<a name=73:2></a> It is a part of the salvation; that is, there is neither positive nor permanent corroboration or enjoyment of the work of Christ without this seal.<a name=73:3></a> Souls are quickened by the Holy Spirit.<a name=73:4></a> The disciples in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>were quickened, but they had not received the Holy Spirit.<a name=73:5></a> The indwelling of the Holy Spirit is distinct from quickening.<a name=73:6></a> "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty", which could not be in the new nature simply.<a name=73:7></a> It is making too little of the Spirit of God to say that quickening and indwelling are identical.<a name=73:8></a> When I am quickened, it is a new creation, and wondrous indeed it is; but as this creation is of Christ, there is added, "the promise of the Father".<a name=73:9></a> The gift of the Holy Spirit unites us to Christ and to one another, and is the power and energy of our new life in Christ.<a name=73:10></a> We must not reduce a gift of God to our comprehension of it, or experiences.<a name=73:11></a> The only true way is to accept, in all its entirety, this most wonderful gift of God; and to search and see how it is given; and then His action, which will follow, will prove the fact.<a name=73:12></a>

		The next thing to ascertain is, how and when the quickened soul is sealed.<a name=74:11></a> It is not necessary that there should be much or any lapse of time, beyond distinctness between the two.<a name=74:12></a> In the purpose of God there is no delay as to the reception of the gift.<a name=74:13></a> The sealing may immediately follow the quickening.<a name=74:14></a> With Saul of Tarsus there was an interval of three days.<a name=74:15></a> Once their distinctness is admitted, there will not be an attempt to settle down in the state of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>, which is being conscious of a new nature, without power to subdue the flesh.<a name=74:16></a> But there will be a looking for the gift of the Holy Spirit from Christ.<a name=74:17></a> Mind <i>it is</i> a gift, and one that He especially

		The great tempest which strained every timber of the assembly was when Paul was imprisoned; and "all who are in Asia", the scene of his greatest labours there, turned away from him.<a name=84:1></a> The great helmsman was driven from his post.<a name=84:2></a> Man's power deprived the assembly of him - the apostle of the gentiles, the master-builder; consequent on this, the assembly lost the consciousness and acknowledgment of Christ's sway therein, as we see in 2 Timothy that it was not able to resist the babblings of the worst kind.<a name=84:3></a> The assembly was not internally in true spiritual power then, and hence outwardly it had become like a great house, with vessels to honour and dishonour.<a name=84:4></a> The individual in spiritual power then was to separate himself from the vessels, though he could not from the house, or external aspect of the assembly.<a name=84:5></a> This the apostle sets forth as the only course for service when the ruin had set in.<a name=84:6></a>

		The apostle, in 2 Timothy, instructs the servant in the truth for the last times; but he directs his attention to the assembly, in the peculiar and singular light, in which it was only given to him; so that the servant who does not learn from 2 Timothy, must lose the course and commission of the assembly, in its innermost responsibilities.<a name=85:4></a> It is true Peter, Jude, and John instruct us respecting the house, or assembly building, more exclusively, while Paul alone instructs us respecting the assembly as the body of Christ.<a name=85:5></a> I do not say that he overlooks the house aspect, but I say he only combines both, or speaks of the body, while still keeping in view the house; while the other apostles speak of the house, and do not refer directly or indirectly to the body; and yet their instruction is essentially necessary; for if the servant confined himself only to 2 Timothy, he would only have the house as it was in connection with the body, and how it was affected by the weakness of the latter; whereas, if he were at the same time imbued with the teaching of Peter, Jude, and John, he would see how the house was damaged by the builders and he would be instructed as to his duty when the rights of Christ on earth were rudely disregarded or misrepresented.<a name=85:6></a>

		Now John insists on the grace of life, as it was at the beginning; while warning of the many antichrists; the denial of the doctrine of Christ; and in the Revelation, while showing, in the seven assemblies, the house aspect on the earth, he points out that the four last would continue to the end, each having for a time a special prominence in succession; yet when the fourth, that is Laodicea, had reached its climax, the assembly would be spued out of the mouth of Christ; it would then be characteristically hopeless.<a name=87:4></a> When truth ceases to be operative, there is no longer any hope for the house on earth; and as this increases characteristically, the influence of Philadelphia, which is the revival of the first standing, must be visibly declining, or the spewing would not be threatened as inevitable.<a name=87:5></a> If there was hope of Philadelphia rising over Laodicea as it had over Sardis, then the spewing out, or summary termination of the house on earth, would not have been threatened.<a name=87:6></a> Now this refers to the house, yet John sees that the end is marked by the bride, who with the Spirit says, "Come" to the Lord.<a name=87:7></a> Then he, as I apprehend, sets forth the truth that the servant is to insist on, in a two-fold way, in the last days; the truth which will deliver from Thyatira and Sardis, and preserve or extricate from Laodicea, on the one hand; and on the other, the assembly, as it is known to Christ; the bride in company with the Holy Spirit inviting Him to come; so that there is the house and the body in John without his referring to the doctrine

		The summing up is, that the servant requires varied lines of truth in the last days; and that all these are necessary, and subserve for the disorganized state of the assembly; and the heart truly stored with them will be adequate for the exigencies of service, in the midst of assembly ruin.<a name=88:2></a> If Paul only be known and followed, Christ's rights on earth, as the kingdom of heaven, would be over-looked, because they would only be recognized according as there was moral power or state suited for the body; whereas if Peter, Jude, and John be exclusively adhered to, the rights of Christ locally would be fully admitted and enforced, but the corporate testimony would be lost sight of, though there would be individual state.<a name=88:3></a> Paul teaches the servant how to care for the house with reference to the body, mainly insisting on what he is to be for it.<a name=88:4></a> Peter teaches how Christ's building is to survive, in spite of false teachers, encouraged by the "day star", and severed from the earth, by the "day of the Lord".<a name=88:5></a> Jude teaches how the saints are to contend for and conserve the faith; to rescue and discriminate, looking unto Him who is able to keep them from falling, and present them faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy.<a name=88:6></a> John teaches the utter and eventual failure of the visible building, but the disclosure of the bride to the "bright and morning star", as Rebekah, when presented to Isaac.<a name=88:7></a> She comes to him, and therefore is practically, with the Spirit, inviting Him to "Come".<a name=88:8></a>

		Man naturally has a conscience, that is, he acquired at the fall the knowledge of good and evil, and according as he becomes intelligent, the claim of the great Supreme, of God, must either be acknowledged and dreaded, or violently, (as by a volcano of the mind) refused and dared.<a name=89:1></a> To escape responsibility is the one great cause of infidelity.<a name=89:2></a> As the mind of man becomes active and informed, the pressure on his conscience increases, and he fears the more, as he is made more assured that he is responsible.<a name=89:3></a> He finds that the more he knows and extends his knowledge, the more accountable is he for his actions - for his whole life; and hence, in this, the incipient stage, he has recourse to every sort of amusement or engrossment, in order to stifle the questions which would arise.<a name=89:4></a> Some time or other the question <i>will</i> come up, and first he evades it by amusements.<a name=89:5></a> The birds of the air carry away every grain of the Word which may reach his soul; this is when there is little activity of mind, and when one is not scripturally educated.<a name=89:6></a>

		The next stage is when the mind is active and the information enlarged.<a name=89:7></a> There is then less ability to evade the question; and there is a fear of the light, or the presentation of truth, because it is afflicting to the conscience, to be called on to settle the question.<a name=89:8></a> In this state there is an avoidance of everything which would stir the question, preferring to leave it entirely unsettled, and to go on without being subjected to the conflict which must ensue before the avowal of infidelity.<a name=89:9></a> In this case the conscience is not hardened, but as it were, kept in the dark, and when light does come, as it often does in such a case, there is always deep distress in reaching the great moral victory - namely, full conviction in the truth of God and His revelation.<a name=89:10></a> The oftener the truth has been turned away from and evaded, the greater the conflict at the end; but in this case there is a desire to find revelation <i>true</i>.<a name=89:11></a> This case generally ends in either religiousness, which satisfies the natural mind, or true conversion to God.<a name=89:12></a>

		The third class is when there is a growing desire to be freed from all responsibility to God.<a name=90:1></a> Now this state arises from either an overweening vanity of mind, which is intolerant of anyone who has a right to control or claim submission, simply pride of mind in its worst form; either this I say, or from conduct which is utterly condemned by conscience, so that there is no relief but in absolute infidelity.<a name=90:2></a> Infidels must rank under either of these two classes.<a name=90:3></a> It is seldom an ignorant man is an infidel, and never, a truly conscientious man.<a name=90:4></a> It is knowledge suddenly acquired, giving an unexpected elevation, which for the most part emboldens a man to limit everything to his own mind, and deny the existence of God.<a name=90:5></a> Hence we find that it is the better educated of the artisan class who are oftenest infidel.<a name=90:6></a> They suddenly reach an elevation unexpected by themselves, and they become so vain in their imaginations, that while they must admit there are some circumstantially superior to them; they betray their folly in asserting that there is nothing higher than their own minds.<a name=90:7></a> Now if, in addition to this, they are reckless and dissolute, not only is their vanity gratified by declaring that there is no God, but it is an unspeakable relief to be freed from all the restraints of conscience, and this the more especially if they previously had been seriously under its control; so that infidelity springs from either the unbridled lust of the mind, or of the flesh.<a name=90:8></a> In one or other, man exalts himself audaciously above all that is called God, and makes man's mind or will the sovereign arbiter of everything.<a name=90:9></a> There is no greater evidence of a weak mind, however brilliant it may be, than an inability truly to estimate one's own powers.<a name=90:10></a> "The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.<a name=90:11></a> They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#14:1">Psalm  14:1</a>.<a name=90:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The great distinctive difference between the leading of God and the opposition of Satan, is, the former has little or nothing visible to assure you; while the other, sways you by the imposing aspect which it presents.<a name=115:4></a> Eve surrendered faith in God, because of what she saw; the visible swayed her, and perverted her heart from the unseen place which she had with God.<a name=115:5></a> Satan's power at first is like a net; there is every visible inducement to draw one into it.<a name=115:6></a> Hence the world is the great engine of it; the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life is of the world: all the great avenues to our hearts naturally are besieged; and, therefore, it is only faith that overcometh the world.<a name=115:7></a> But when the net has been escaped, then the fire of persecution is stirred up.<a name=115:8></a> Satan's great object seems ever to be to conceal himself behind his visible agency, while the blessed God ever desires that we should rise above everything visible, be it great or small, and see Him who is invisible in every step of our course.<a name=115:9></a> Satan would deceive man by the tower of Babel.<a name=115:10></a> God leads Abraham by nothing visible, to leave all and go out, not knowing whither he went - looking for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.<a name=115:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We are not spiritual enough to distinguish between these two powers until we are in our true calling.<a name=115:12></a> True, like Israel, we have many experiences before we are in happy occupation of it; that is, until one feels one is in the large place.<a name=115:13></a> When I am spiritual I can see, as it were, behind the scenes; and I am made sensible of contending, not merely with what is visible, whatever be its aspect, but with wicked spirits in heavenly places.<a name=115:14></a> There is

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, as I have said, we cannot know the greatness of either power until we are in practical possession of the place to which God has called us.<a name=116:2></a> When we reach this - when we truly and happily accept our calling of heavenly men on the earth - we encounter Satan's power in quite a different way.<a name=116:3></a> Up to this it was Pharaoh, Amalek, or Balaam, not to speak of the giants and the cities walled up to heaven, which had so discouraged them that they proposed to return to Egypt, and thus proved themselves unworthy of the land.<a name=116:4></a> The effort of Satan, and the forms of his power up to this was to prevent their entering the land - reaching the calling of God.<a name=116:5></a> But once we have admitted that to be heavenly here is our only true calling, then the power of Satan is concentrated and organised, that is, everything in the world is against us.<a name=116:6></a> Man and every one of his works are distinctly hostile to the heavenly man.<a name=116:7></a> Satan makes no secret of the world's hatred, and as long as we are confronted or opposed by the mere world we are aware of our foe.<a name=116:8></a> But, besides the open and positive hatred and hostility of the world which is simply the first and general form of Satan's power against the heavenly man (and this Jericho represents), there are religious pretensions, or feints, if I may so call them, to seduce the true man from his standing.<a name=116:9></a> The open hostility of the world is always safe, because there is nothing to deceive; though there be great tribulation, there is always the manifest assurance that we are in the right; it is perdition to them, but salvation to us.<a name=116:10></a> (<a href="../bible/2Thessalonians.htm#1">2 Thessalonians  1</a>).<a name=116:11></a> In the typical Canaan the power of the world, as I have said, was the first thing distinctly presented, and opposing.<a name=116:12></a> The heavenly man who patiently continues in armour and prayer will eventually, through the power of God, triumph over it.<a name=116:13></a>

		THE HEAVENLY MAN IN THE WILDERNESS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The calling of the saint now is heavenly; but as he is on the earth, his experiences are necessarily how grace forms and separates him from what is simply natural to him, and enables him to be true to his new standing in a scene to which he once so entirely belonged.<a name=119:6></a> Hence there is first the entering into the liberty wherewith Christ has made him free, before he enjoys for himself his new calling, or can truly walk according to it here.<a name=119:7></a> For that very progress in grace which introduces him into heavenly joys, demands and empowers him to be true to it in his walk here.<a name=119:8></a> But as he is still on the earth, where the world is directly against God, the more heavenly he is, the more he feels that he is in the wilderness.<a name=119:9></a> The real character and nature of what the world is to the Spirit of Christ, is made known to him, so that unlike the type, Israel, as he passes out of the wilderness to Canaan, which simply represents the heavenly man on earth, he learns that the more fully and truly he is a heavenly man, the deeper and fuller experiences has he of the real character of the wilderness.<a name=119:10></a> The <i>one</i> really

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The consequences of Israel passing out of the wilderness into Canaan to dwell altogether in the latter, led eventually to their captivity and deprivation of the land.<a name=120:3></a> They became so elated and independent because of the bright and pleasing circumstances of Canaan, that they forgot God, and proved themselves unworthy of the promised land.<a name=120:4></a> Now in the antitype there is this immense difference, that the more the saint is really in the new ground, answering to Canaan; the more is he placed in circumstances here to keep him in dependence, that is, this scene is more a wilderness to him.<a name=120:5></a> The wilderness means whatever are my ostensible circumstances, or occupation as a man, and is a place where nothing contributes to me, and where all my resources are in God.<a name=120:6></a> Many on first reaching the liberty and rest of the heavenly standing fail, and are carried away into captivity to the world, because they have not continued in dependence on God.<a name=120:7></a>

		True, immense light with joy is made known to the heart, as it learns and advances into the portion of a heavenly man; but the saint, who because of this great moral elevation, should be deceived into the idea that he is from henceforth out of the wilderness trials, and therefore less dependent on God because of what he possesses, would become the prey either of some religious

	<div class="paragraph">
		In Scripture we find, and our own experience is corroborative of it, that the more one enters into the height to which grace has called him, the more is he subjected to trials here, if he be conscientious, in order to check the boastfulness of the flesh, because of an assured moral exaltation.<a name=121:3></a> The blessed Lord was the perfect heavenly Man on earth, and yet no one was so exposed to every kind of opposition and contradiction here; not, of course, that the check was needed with Him, but He was to be as perfect as a wilderness Man as He was as a heavenly Man.<a name=121:4></a> He was perfectly solitary here; no one could reach to His moral eminence, and yet they saw no beauty in Him, but said, "This is the heir; come, let us kill him".<a name=121:5></a> They hated Him without a cause, refuge failed Him, no man cared for Him; indeed, all forsook Him and fled.<a name=121:6></a> He was alone, the Father was with Him.<a name=121:7></a> He was His hope from His "mother's belly".<a name=121:8></a> When He entered on the path of service here, He was led of the Spirit into the wilderness, to be tempted of the devil.<a name=121:9></a> The greatest heavenly Man is the best wilderness Man; and hence, He replies to Satan's first temptation that He should turn the stones into bread, by quoting from <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#8">Deuteronomy  8</a>, "Man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth man live".<a name=121:10></a> This described the grand result to be effected by wilderness experience.<a name=121:11></a> The Lord is perfectly educated as a wilderness Man, and He is invincible, for "blessed is the man that trusteth in thee".<a name=121:12></a>

		THE LAST GREAT REVIVAL
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Everything on earth consigned to man, from the garden of Eden to the assembly, has failed.<a name=124:6></a> However brilliant and effective its beginning, it soon became tarnished; the bright gold became dim, until at length there was little or no trace of the original order of things.<a name=124:7></a> Yet in every instance there was a season of marked favour from God, before that which was marred was utterly set aside, as connected with the first man on earth; for each form of God's ways with men, from Eden to the assembly, will be re-established on the earth, by and through the Son of His love.<a name=124:8></a> But in each of them, after open failure, there is a reviving again, in peculiar manner, before a new order is introduced.<a name=124:9></a>

		HOW TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE FLESH AND THE SPIRIT
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is the flesh and the Spirit in every believer: Before the indwelling of the Spirit of God, there is but one energy - the flesh; but, consequent on the sealing of the Spirit, there is another energy, namely, the Spirit of God, who seeks and demands the entire rule.<a name=134:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now these two energies always resist one another; "the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would", <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#5:17">Galatians  5:17</a>.<a name=134:2></a> The Spirit has the sway.<a name=134:3></a> The great and constant aim and labour of the Spirit is to suppress and silence the flesh, while the unceasing effort of the flesh is to reoccupy the place of unquestioned sway, which it once had, and which it ever exerts, when not controlled by the Spirit.<a name=134:4></a> It is a new era when the Spirit dwells in the believer, for though there be not always a cessation of the flesh's strife, yet it ever grieves the Spirit, and the saint is conscious often of depression, without knowing the cause of it.<a name=134:5></a> The new and legitimate ruler has been hindered by the old one; and "he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption", but if we "walk in the Spirit", we "shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh".<a name=134:6></a> "If ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:13">Romans  8:13</a>.<a name=134:7></a> The believer, indwelt by the Spirit of God, is conscious of two things: on the one hand, that there is a new power in him stronger than the old one; and on the other, that the old one must be refused, or the new one will be hindered and grieved; that is, that the old one will not give in once and for ever, but is ever ready to seek what ministers to it.<a name=134:8></a> Hence the exhortation, "If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit".<a name=134:9></a> Admit the right of the Spirit, and this cannot be done without refusing the will of the flesh, which is ever ready to seek countenance, and resume its former place.<a name=134:10></a>

		Two things are necessary in order to insure the value and permanency of any structure, namely, material and skill.<a name=143:5></a> The one is that with which it is to be built; and the other, the manner in which the work is done.<a name=143:6></a> It is evident that any building must suffer from defects in either of these, only with this difference, that when the material is good, but there is deficiency of skill in using it, the defect will be apparent from the start.<a name=143:7></a> There is no good building then; but when there is skill with bad material, there will often be the appearance of good

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In order therefore to secure good building, or effective teaching, there must be two things - divine material, and divine skill; the lack of either is fatal to the building.<a name=144:2></a> The only good material is the word of His grace, and the only true skill is the charity or grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and when either is wanting, there is a lack of real service to the saints.<a name=144:3></a> The best of servants may not succeed in building, but none can expect to succeed except he builds rightly.<a name=144:4></a> There may be the heart and purpose to serve, without the means to effect it.<a name=144:5></a> Moses was most genuine in his purpose to serve, and had made the greatest sacrifices in order to do so, but at first he utterly failed; he had neither material nor skill.<a name=144:6></a> After a lapse of forty years, he returned to Egypt with the word of the Lord, and in all the patience and grace of a true servant.<a name=144:7></a> Then he was efficient, though he was often baffled and almost overwhelmed.<a name=144:8></a> It is important to note that often the most zealous servants at first, have neither the word nor the skill or temper for using it, and therefore are like Peter, very eager, but like him cutting off the right ear in their attempt at serving.<a name=144:9></a>

		It is striking and deeply interesting the pains the Lord takes to make His servants skilful.<a name=145:2></a> No amount of truth - material - will succeed to the credit of the servant, apart from skill or charity.<a name=145:3></a> A man, to be an effective teacher, must be a living transcript of the truth he insists on; if he is not, he is urging others to adopt what he has not adopted himself, and he weakens its force, in that while he asserts it will produce distinct effects on those who receive it, he cannot show perhaps a trace of them on himself.<a name=145:4></a> The effective teaching is when one can say, like Gideon, "As I do, so shall ye do"; or as the apostle, We were "an ensample unto you to follow us".<a name=145:5></a> Again, "Brethren, be followers together of me"; still more.<a name=145:6></a> "Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ".<a name=145:7></a>

		We know that the word of God accomplishes that whereto it has been sent, and unless there was something to hinder its action in the instrument conveying it, I conclude that the action would occur, though it may not always be visible.<a name=145:8></a> It is plain that whenever the Lord speaks to a soul (that is, in all the recorded cases in Scripture) that where there is "good ground" there is a true and blessed effect; hence it is said to the servant, "If thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth", <a href="../bible/Jeremiah..htm#15:19">Jeremiah.  15:19</a>.<a name=145:9></a> When the word is not presented in its purity, if it were to have an effect, then it would be an injurious effect, because it is not the truth, or at least it is imperfect truth.<a name=145:10></a> The servant who is not careful in adhering to the word of God is so practically unsubdued in himself, where the subjection must always be first and greatest, that he must be unskilful and too self-important to be of any use to others.<a name=145:11></a> It is said in reference to service "Make the tree good, and his fruit good".<a name=145:12></a> <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#12:33">Matthew  12:33</a>.<a name=145:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I can always count on the good soil in a saint, that is, that though he be very much carried away by present things, though slumbering and sleeping with no bodily activity for Christ, yet that he can be awakened, and aroused to a true sense of his duty.<a name=146:5></a> Hence the apostle writes fifteen chapters to the Corinthians, not to expose a great moral enormity then already well known, but to arouse their consciences to a sense of their complicity with evil in consequence of it.<a name=146:6></a> A servant has a wonderful character and amazing skill, when he gives no offence or occasion of stumbling in anything that the ministry be not blamed.<a name=146:7></a> How formed of God, what an exemplification of the power and greatness of grace, when he can in any measure say with the apostle, "In everything commending ourselves as God's ministers, in much endurance, in afflictions, in necessities, in straits, in stripes, in prisons, in riots, in labours, in watchings, in fastings, in pureness, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in love unfeigned, in the word of truth, in the power of God; through the arms of righteousness on the right hand and left, through glory and dishonour, through evil report and good report: as deceivers, and true; as unknown, and well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as disciplined, and not put to death; as grieved, but always rejoicing; as poor, but enriching many; as having nothing, and possessing all things", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#6:4">2 Corinthians  6:4</a> - 10.<a name=146:8></a>

		It is very serious how the lack of the servant becomes aggravated in the saints.<a name=147:1></a> The servant said in his heart, "My lord delayeth his coming", the church slumbered and slept.<a name=147:2></a> The servant is held accountable for the state of the saints to whom he ministers, as John says, when exhorting the saints in his first epistle, as a motive to their faithfulness, that we may "not be ashamed before him at his coming".<a name=147:3></a> Do servants enter much into this?<a name=147:4></a> That they should be ashamed before the Lord at His coming because of the state of the saints.<a name=147:5></a> The anticipation of such a thing would surely urge the servants to take a deeper interest in the welfare of the saints among whom they minister; as Paul says (<a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#2:19">1 Thessalonians  2:19</a>,20), "For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing?<a name=147:6></a> Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?<a name=147:7></a> For ye are our glory and joy".<a name=147:8></a> Or, as we learn from <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#13:17">Hebrews  13:17</a>, that the teachers watch for their souls as they that must give account, and as John says, the servant would lose his reward because of the declension of the saints.<a name=147:9></a> "Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward".<a name=147:10></a> <a href="../bible/2John.htm#8">2 John  8</a>.<a name=147:11></a>

		The cases and the passages I have cited must impress on every servant the grave and laborious duties of his calling, and that good building or effective teaching is a very slow, very arduous, a very continual, but a very blessed work, carrying its own reward with it.<a name=147:12></a> On the other hand, if any man build on the best foundation, "wood, hay, stubble; every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.<a name=147:13></a> If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.<a name=147:14></a> If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire".<a name=147:15></a> <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3:12">1 Corinthians  3:12</a> - 15.<a name=147:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The existence of an active evil spirit no one with any conscience will deny, but it is important to determine when the work of the flesh becomes the work of Satan.<a name=148:5></a> As a rule we may say that the act of the flesh merely, as such, is simply gratification, and is marked more by eagerness to be pleased, than by the energy that works for some definite end.<a name=148:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us examine some of the instances in scripture respecting the kinds of satanic action there spoken of.<a name=149:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first occasion of Satan's influence discloses to us the great marks by which we can ever discover it.<a name=149:3></a> The serpent in its subtilty assails the simple and unsuspecting Eve, insinuating an idea by a remark that does not awaken alarm, unless you are walking in the Spirit of holiness.<a name=149:4></a> If the remark interests you, and you give heed to it, the word of God is perverted; it is not denied, but explained away; the qualifying of the word of God is first entertained and then it is perverted.<a name=149:5></a> When this is gained, then an immediate gratification is offered to the carnal mind.<a name=149:6></a> Eve saw that the tree was good for food, pleasant to the eye, and a tree to be desired to make one wise.<a name=149:7></a> When Satan's counsel is accepted, he lends his dupe energy to act according to it.<a name=149:8></a> In every satanic agency there is a distinct opposition to God, be it His way or His word.<a name=149:9></a> Whatever is the revealed and leading desire of God for His saints at any time, is always the great object of Satan's opposition, and this I call the first class of satanic action.<a name=149:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus Noah's downfall, through drinking of the fruit of the vine, though not properly satanic, was made by Satan an opportunity for defeating the favour of God to man, and he used Canaan, Noah's own son, to be the minister of the exposure.<a name=149:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the building of the tower of Babel was satanic, and of this class.<a name=149:12></a> Men bound together by a common object, and with the one purpose, systematically and definitely to be independent of God, and of His judgment on the earth, which was in direct contravention to His goodness and favour to man who had just been reinstated on the earth on new and greatly improved terms.<a name=149:13></a>

		Man is a powerless creature; hence, whenever he is in

	<div class="paragraph">
		a strait, if he has not God and His power to turn to, he is glad of support from any quarter.<a name=150:1></a> Satan avails himself of this sense of want, whenever it occurs, because of the assertion of the claims of God, or the manifestation of His mercy.<a name=150:2></a> Thus the magicians, in Pharaoh's time, offer their help, when Pharaoh is helpless before the power of God for His people, and they continue their opposition until entirely baffled by Moses.<a name=150:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Whenever there is an opportunity for distinct opposition to God, though at first concealed, Satan readily lends his aid; he will entrap not only the Pharaoh, the one who rebels most against God, but the one most responsible for maintaining the truth.<a name=150:4></a> No eminence can preserve me from Satan's influence, when once I am disposed to adopt a departure from the divine course for which I am responsible.<a name=150:5></a> Hence when Aaron was inclined to pacify the people, by something outside the divine way, Satan readily made a tool of him to construct a golden calf.<a name=150:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord's temptation in the wilderness is also of this class.<a name=150:7></a> Satan's attempt is to set aside and overthrow the most singular and wonderful manifestation of God's mercy to man.<a name=150:8></a> There are three heads in this temptation, and under one or other of these, every temptation to the saint now can be placed.<a name=150:9></a> The first is to act independently of God when you are in need.<a name=150:10></a> Secondly, to gain the world by means not of God; and thirdly, to seek eminence among men by the interposition of God on your behalf.<a name=150:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Whatever is the special thing with Christ at any time, that is the thing, be it great or small, which Satan attempts to contravene.<a name=150:12></a> Hence the Lord calls Peter "Satan" when he rebuked Him for announcing His death.<a name=150:13></a> The termination of man in the death of Christ was the very thing which would provoke all the opposition and force of Satan; so much so, that the man most endowed of God, as was Peter (see <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:18">Matthew  16:18</a>,19), is the one guilty of this great mistake, and this with the kindest natural feelings, out of simple personal affection to the Lord.<a name=150:14></a>

		In a like way Satan would turn aside and spoil the

		assembly at the very start, by inducing Ananias and Sapphira to make an untrue representation of their surrender, in order that they might obtain a position and a name on false grounds, without being detected; and thus virtually and practically to deny the presence of the Holy Spirit.<a name=151:1></a> This is necessarily a main effort of Satan to this day.<a name=151:2></a> The principle of his opposition is the same under every circumstance.<a name=151:3></a> In Corinth he succeeded in leading the assembly to refuse the cross practically, adopting the doctrine of Peter, when he rebuked the Lord for speaking of His death; and thus, notwithstanding all the gift and knowledge they possessed, they were overrun by every carnal enormity.<a name=151:4></a> Now when the word of the Lord had awakened the conscience of the assembly to a sense of the defilement they were implicated in, because of the sin tolerated in their midst, and they in zeal and faithfulness had cleared themselves of it by excommunicating the wicked person, Satan then was ready to make them too severe and unyielding.<a name=151:5></a> Of this the apostle warns them in the words, "Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices".<a name=151:6></a> That is, he would urge them not to be unduly strict, as before they were unduly lax and indifferent.<a name=151:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this first kind of satanic action must be reckoned the continued and unceasing opposition of Satan against those who claim their right to possess and enjoy the heavenly places.<a name=151:8></a> "For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places".<a name=151:9></a> (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#6:12">Ephesians  6:12</a>.<a name=151:10></a>) This is never relaxed, and only experienced as one is practically insisting on being a dweller in heaven like the children of Israel in Canaan, and it is known by the varied and systematic way one is hindered and checked from occupying one's heavenly position.<a name=151:11></a>

		The second kind of satanic action is more personal, and refers to one's predisposition for it; such as natural forwardness in acting for the Lord.<a name=152:4></a> Satan desired to sift Peter as wheat; he had got possession of Judas.<a name=152:5></a> He had influenced man generally against the Lord, and now he attempts to lead the faithful ardent Peter into the pit.<a name=152:6></a> Grace from Christ preserves him, but it is important for us to note how Satan deceives and beguiles him.<a name=152:7></a> First, he leads him to act in an apparently brave, but really a rash way, in cutting off the ear of the high priest's servant; and then, led on in his desire to see the end, gratified through the intervention of a friend; and now, when his feet are made fast in the net, he exposes himself, and denies his Master.<a name=152:8></a> Then, convicted by the Lord's word, he retires in shame and sorrow of heart.<a name=152:9></a> It is amazing the craft and subtilty of Satan, and the insatiable nature of his malice.<a name=152:10></a> It was not enough for Satan that he had fatally duped Judas, that he had influenced all classes of men against Christ, but he must lay toils for Peter, in order that through one deeply attached to the Lord, he might exhibit the contrary, and make it appear that there was no reality in the heart.<a name=152:11></a> Thus, while most opposed to the setting aside of man in the cross, he does the most to disparage man, by leading him into evil and disgraceful conduct.<a name=152:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The third kind is when God allows Satan to be His scourge; first, not for actual failure, but for progress and blessing.<a name=153:7></a> Thus it was with Job.<a name=153:8></a> Satan was allowed to afflict him in everything, but not to take away his life.<a name=153:9></a> Perhaps nothing can disclose more the nature and malice of Satan, than the readiness and severity with which he uses his liberty towards Job; but it was allowed of God, though fearful to the saint for the time, and calculated to overwhelm him in unbelief, which was what Satan mainly desired, for he sought to prove that Job served God because of His favours to him.<a name=153:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In a like way, but more continuously, Paul suffers from a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet him.<a name=153:11></a> Could anything be more grievous or humbling, than to be exposed to the constant personal interruption by a foe, of one's desires and efforts to serve the Lord?<a name=153:12></a> This Paul required in order to preserve him from vain-gloriousness; and Satan was made the instrument, by afflicting him thus grievously, of effecting this great good.<a name=153:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is one more class or order of satanic action which I must notice.<a name=153:14></a> It is when a "wicked person" is handed over to Satan, as in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5">1 Corinthians  5</a>, for the destruction of the flesh; and in <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#1">1 Timothy  1</a>, "That they may learn not to blaspheme".<a name=153:15></a> It is not easy to pronounce the nature and character of the afflictions to which a saint would be subjected who was consigned, though certainly with a limitation, to Satan's cruelty; only this we may be assured of, that though the process is a severe one, yet the object intended to be effected by it shall assuredly be accomplished, because it is the remedy prescribed by God Himself.<a name=153:16></a>

		OVERSIGHT AND RULE

	<div class="paragraph">
		The idea of love in any true sense, implies that there must be care and oversight of the objects of it; and in proportion as there is wisdom and superiority, so must this oversight become a responsibility, while as it is accepted and appreciated, with a sense of duty to obey and observe its injunctions, when the heart is not corrupted and perverse.<a name=154:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Adam in the garden of Eden was peculiarly under this oversight so blessed and good, which he refused and lost, when he in disobedience acted according to his own will; he disregarded the highest counsel, and the rule, which in the greatness of His love and wisdom, God had imposed.<a name=154:9></a> This introduced a root of evil which has ever since corrupted the nature of man.<a name=154:10></a> But though there be opposition to the oversight and rule, yet the superior in love and wisdom according to his relation to me, and claim upon me, is responsible to exercise both; and there is disobedience and perverseness when there is not subjection to him.<a name=154:11></a> Hence it is enjoined in the first commandment with promise, that children should obey their parents.<a name=154:12></a> "Honour thy father and thy mother".<a name=154:13></a> The opening and beginning of life here is subjected to

	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus oversight and rule are the established principles of government, beginning with our earliest life here, and in the nearest relationship, and in figure and measure, it expresses and indicates the oversight and rule, which each one believing in God would enjoy and be blessed by, as he submitted to it.<a name=155:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I need not enter on a history of rule, but it is simply necessary that it should exist; that the one with ability and consideration, should overlook and direct his fellows; and they, as they have sense, should submit to his rule, or suffer for their disobedience.<a name=155:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		At first Israel had no king, the fullest oversight and rule were vouchsafed to them from God Himself; but gradually they lapsed into the ways of the nations around them, and they yielded themselves to a king, or rule where there was power but not the oversight, which love dictates and imposes, a separation most fatal in its consequence.<a name=155:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Among men there was no reciprocal responsibility of this kind, before the death of Christ.<a name=155:7></a> It was enjoined as we have seen as the great bond of families, and the blessing of children, but from man to man it was not known.<a name=155:8></a> Cain readily said, "Am I my brother's keeper?<a name=155:9></a>" True the law required that man should love his neighbour as himself, but as it did not confer on him the power to do so, it only exposed his inability to fulfil a fundamental duty; and this was exemplified when both the priest and the levite left the half-dead man to perish (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10">Luke  10</a>).<a name=155:10></a> But when the love of God to man appeared, then came the new commandment, "Love one another, <i>as</i> I have loved you".<a name=155:11></a> It is therefore now the responsibility of every individual believer to love his brother as Christ has

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now as this is common to all, and incumbent on all, it is easy to see that the elder brothers should be the most competent for this great and arduous service.<a name=156:5></a> Of course it is not always simply elders in age, though that of itself is necessary; because a bishop or elder was not to be "a novice", and they were appointed by the Holy Spirit to the office as qualified pre-eminently for fulfilling the duties of oversight and rule.<a name=156:6></a> They had the grace for the office before they were appointed.<a name=156:7></a> They had some measure of the gift of a pastor, who by gift is a shepherd; that is, grace is given to him by the Lord to feed His sheep, and declare to them His mind suitable to their need.<a name=156:8></a> But though thus highly gifted, such an one would not necessarily be an overseer; because with the overseer or elder there was rule with respect to circumstantials, and the conducting of things.<a name=156:9></a> There was to be an overlooking of the doctrines taught; and of the manners of the saints in general.<a name=156:10></a> Just as the deacons directed their attention to the temporal wants of the saints, so the elders were occupied with the moral condition of the house of God.<a name=156:11></a> The apostles Paul and Peter were very express in their injunctions on this subject.<a name=156:12></a> The former, writing to Titus, says, "For this cause I left thee in Crete, that thou mightest.<a name=156:13></a>.<a name=156:14></a>.<a name=156:15></a> establish elders in each city".<a name=156:16></a> It was of the last importance that there should be godly oversight and rule.<a name=156:17></a> He had written to Timothy, "if any one aspires to exercise oversight, he desires a good work"; that is, the oversight is a good work.<a name=156:18></a> And when at Miletus, he would communicate with the church, he does not send for the gifted men, as such; but he sends

		for the <i>elders</i>.<a name=157:1></a> I do not say that they were not gifted, but it is with regard to their local position that he selects them.<a name=157:2></a> An elder is local, a pastor is general, belonging to the whole church of God.<a name=157:3></a> The apostle's desire or injunction was that the saints should be subject to this rule and oversight.<a name=157:4></a> He says, "And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you; and to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake", <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#5:12">1 Thessalonians  5:12</a>,13.<a name=157:5></a> Again, in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#13:17">Hebrews  13:17</a>, "Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account", etc.<a name=157:6></a> Again, Peter exhorts the elders to "Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof".<a name=157:7></a> (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#5:2">1 Peter  5:2</a>.<a name=157:8></a>) All those passages prove that rule and oversight were inalienable prerogatives of the house of God, where all things should be done decently and in order.<a name=157:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now those who exercised this rule and oversight were not the gifted men absolutely.<a name=157:10></a> A pastor had the spiritual powers of an elder, but he had more, and it was not as a pastor he was enjoined to oversee and rule, but as an elder.<a name=157:11></a> Hence when ruin came in (and through mercy the gifts remained, as given by the Head in heaven) and order was succeeded by disorder, the effort in christendom has been to connect the office of overseers or elders with the gift, and when this is done, the clerical element is assumed.<a name=157:12></a> When the right to oversee and rule is denied, the radical element is in the ascendant.<a name=157:13></a> There is in the latter the desire and purpose to do their own will, and in the former to assert the right to rule, because of being a teacher, and thus natural ambition works in the servant of Christ.<a name=157:14></a> These two opposite forces are often found in the same meeting, each trying to correct the other; though the only true way is by owning the responsibility to oversee and rule, in those whom Christ has given grace and qualification for it, and so separating between the office and the gift, that the teacher, unless
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=158>[Page 158]</a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In a day of ruin like this it is evident that the attempt to appoint elders or overseers, and deacons, in any place assumes that the church is not broken up into sections, and that in making the selection or appointment, one has all those duly qualified before one, ready for the charge.<a name=158:2></a> This is not the case; and the work of gathering saints together on the ground of the one body of Christ, must precede any formal ordination of elders and deacons; but though there can be no attempt to ordain them, until the saints are on one common ground, yet it is clear that oversight and rule are fundamental principles; and though the official title cannot be appropriated by any, or conferred by any one to any one; yet there is grace given of God, so that by one or another the work should be done, and as there is true subjection of spirit, there will be an aiding of one another; the elders will be alive to their responsibility and the others ready to bow to everything of God, because expecting it.<a name=158:3></a> The right to oversee and rule implies a reciprocity on the part of others, if there be grace to submit to oversight and rule.<a name=158:4></a> And practically, where there is most oversight and godly rule, though there be little gift, there is always a happier state in the assembly than where there is much more apparent gift, and little oversight and rule.<a name=158:5></a> For when divine love is truly exercised, and duly received, and responded to, there must be the greatest development and manifestation of every christian grace.<a name=158:6></a>

		THE TWO SIDES OF GRACE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The reality of any favour is according as it meets one's need; the greatness of it, as it places one in a condition free of that need.<a name=168:1></a> These two traits are pre-eminently found in every form of the grace of God.<a name=168:2></a> As the sense of need is necessarily the one uppermost in one's mind, the tendency is generally to limit the grace of God to the need only.<a name=168:3></a> It is truly wondrous that the deep needs of the soul should be entirely and fully met; and as it requires the power of God to open the eye of the soul to see the first part which is the one so much required; so in like manner, His Spirit only can convince me, that He can place me in a condition free from need.<a name=168:4></a> How many delight in the first verse of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#23">Psalm  23</a>, "The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want", who never even contemplate or expect the second; where one is set in a place where only abundance meets the eye, and where want is unknown.<a name=168:5></a> "He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters".<a name=168:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now let me say in connection with this important subject, that it will be found that no one is solidly and confirmedly assured of the removal of his need, until he finds himself in a condition in which he is absolutely free of it; hence the knowledge of the greatness of grace is indispensable for the corroboration of the utility of grace.<a name=168:7></a> In order to be fully assured that I shall not want, I must know that I am out of reach of want, and set in abundance.<a name=168:8></a> There is many a one who, while really possessing the first, is often doubtful about it, because he, either through ignorance or want of faith, has not reached the second.<a name=168:9></a>

		The word to the apostle was, "To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me".<a name=168:10></a> The word to Moses was, "Bring

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is well to consider the moral defect which arises from limiting the grace of God only to its utility; - that is to say, limiting it to the fact that it meets the need of man.<a name=169:3></a> If the forgiveness of sins was the limit or the extent of grace to man, he would simply be a forgiven man, - a child of Adam forgiven for the offences which he had committed, and the whole occupation of his conscience would be to obtain forgiveness for any sin he might commit.<a name=169:4></a> The state of a new man in Christ, belonging to a new sphere, with a divine nature, would be entirely unknown to him.<a name=169:5></a> Let us examine some of the instances in Scripture where the two sides of grace are plainly presented, and thus entail perfect blessing.<a name=169:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>we have the great and eventual statement, "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world".<a name=169:7></a> Nothing could be more comprehensive regarding the sin, for it plainly embraces sin of every kind and degree.<a name=169:8></a> It announces the removing away from the earth the cause of all God's judgments; so that we shall have a world without sin; but this, though so great is only one side; for in the context, there is announced the further blessing, the other half of grace, "he it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit".<a name=169:9></a> One cannot in a moment comprehend the vastness of this addition.<a name=169:10></a> Sin is not only removed, but the holiness of God is brought in, in divine power, by the baptism of the Holy Spirit.<a name=169:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 3: 14 - 15 we read, "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life".<a name=169:12></a> Here we have stated the rescue and the benefit; but in chapter 4: 14 we get the other side; "whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give

		him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life".<a name=170:1></a> In chapter 3 you get the mode and the nature of the relief conferred here; but in chapter 4 you get the manner and the power by which this benefit is perpetuated, in divine fulness and vigour.<a name=170:2></a> If one had only the first part, there would be the sense of an unspeakable relief, with the assurance that it was for ever; but there could be no present divine sense of its inexhaustible nature, or power, which is independent of all natural feelings, were not the Holy Spirit in us, a well of water springing up into everlasting life.<a name=170:3></a> We find our blessed Lord presenting this side of grace first to the woman of Samaria.<a name=170:4></a> He desired to awaken her heart to the great fact of what He could give to a sinner on earth; and that, outside and apart from anything on the earth.<a name=170:5></a> True, she required to learn the other side also; hence He made her feel that she was a sinner; and that she required the first part of grace, before she could enjoy the second part; but that the second part would place her in a position where the need which had to be relieved would not occur.<a name=170:6></a> And there only would relief be fully assured.<a name=170:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again in chapters 8 and 9.<a name=170:8></a> There we get the history of light.<a name=170:9></a> It not only relieves, as in chapter 8, where we read, "If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death"; but in chapter 9, the blind man has light in him; and he finds that the place of full and unbounded enjoyment is in the presence of Christ, when he is cast out by the religious man on earth.<a name=170:10></a> He is not only relieved by light of the terrible darkness, but he is now a child of the light, finding entire satisfaction, when outside of everything of man - in his best estate, worshipping the Son of God - the Source of light - and here only can any one learn his path for Christ on earth, or the consolation by Christ.<a name=170:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The priesthood of Christ has two parts.<a name=171:4></a> In all my weakness down here He is touched with the feeling of my infirmities.<a name=171:5></a> I can ever reckon on His sympathy as I walk here according to His word; supported and cheered by His countenance and help, who has encountered every one of them, but apart from sin; and thus able to keep me apart from it.<a name=171:6></a> But not this only - He is a great Priest over the house of God.<a name=171:7></a> He has entered into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us.<a name=171:8></a> So that He - blessed be His name - not only bears me up in the scene of my weakness down here; but He maintains me also in the greatness of God, in the holiest of all; and the more I know of Him in the latter, the more confiding am I in Him in my difficulties here.<a name=171:9></a> The soul who knows best the side of the grace which has feasted him in the Father's house is the one who most truly knows and reckons on the other side, even the services rendered by the good neighbour to the one down here.<a name=171:10></a> If I limit him to the earthly side, I confine Him to my need; and I lose the knowledge of Him in His own scene, where I can only know Him for my scene; but if I know Him in bright perfect scenes, as such I can count on His help and sympathy in my scene.<a name=171:11></a> The tendency is to reduce Him to the measure of man.<a name=171:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One more example.<a name=172:4></a> The Holy Spirit is sent down, not only to comfort me (see <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:26">John  14:26</a>), but also to testify for Christ.<a name=172:5></a> (See <a href="../bible/John.htm#15:26">John  15:26</a>.<a name=172:6></a>) It is not only the Holy Spirit acting in me, but acting for Him; so that in proportion as I am in the second, I am enlarged in the first.<a name=172:7></a> And when any one confines, or in any way limits the Holy Spirit's action to the believer only, he correspondingly weakens the power of the Spirit for his own enjoyment; because he has curtailed or denied the side of His action where there is the greater manifestation and scope for it; as if a man would limit the light of the sun to those only who appreciate it.<a name=172:8></a> The principle simply rests on the great purpose of God, not only to reach us in our need, but to bring us to Himself.<a name=172:9></a>

		There has always been some special thing before the mind of the Lord, which is His secret at the time, but which He delights to communicate to every servant walking in faith and fear, as He did to Abraham.<a name=172:11></a> Generally this secret is unknown, until it has fully transpired, and thus the peculiar foresight or preparation, which the knowledge of it would have imparted, has been missed or forfeited; and the servant, though he may be very zealous, is occupied with a course, however good, which is not the one uppermost and progressive in the Lord's mind, and which is about to be displaced by

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The great point then is that there is something peculiarly prominent in the mind of the Lord.<a name=173:9></a> It is plain that if we retrace His history on the earth, and all along to this hour, that at distinct epochs there was some one thing very specially before His mind; and when we apprehend this, we are, according to our devotedness, solicitous to ascertain what is the thing which He is at this moment set on.<a name=173:10></a> When He emerged from private life into public service, to propound the kingdom of God, and to be His servant, was the great thing before His mind.<a name=173:11></a> When this culminated in the holy mount, when He received an acknowledgment from the excellent glory of His worth and title, He descended with quite another thing before His mind, even His decease, which He was to accomplish at Jerusalem.<a name=173:12></a> After He rose,

		HOW TO CEASE FROM SIN
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before we can rightly consider the subject of ceasing from sin, we must first understand what sin is.<a name=221:4></a> Sin is lawlessness.<a name=221:5></a> Sin is the act, or the intent to act, according to my own will.<a name=221:6></a> "When lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin".<a name=221:7></a> Sin entered when Eve acted in contravention of the word of God, in accordance with her own judgment and will.<a name=221:8></a> It was not that she did anything morally degrading; and it did not lessen the fact of its being sin, because her act would greatly contribute to her advantage, and raise her in the natural scale.<a name=221:9></a> It is important to see that sin is not confined to immorality, or to anything degrading; it is simply running counter to the will of God, and there may be grievous sin, where everything is nice and advantageous in a human point of view.<a name=221:10></a> Saul of Tarsus lived in all good conscience, and was, concerning the righteousness which is in the law, blameless, and yet he was the chief of sinners, because, with all his moral reputation, he was in will and act opposed to God.<a name=221:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The thought of foolishness is sin.<a name=221:12></a> Whatsoever is not of faith is sin.<a name=221:13></a> In a word, "the carnal mind [or the mind of the flesh] is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be".<a name=221:14></a> "In me, (that

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We must, however, distinguish between the claims of nature, such as hunger, cold, etc.<a name=222:4></a>, as the Creator made man, and the desires of the flesh and of the mind, which are man's inventions.<a name=222:5></a> God made man upright, but he has sought out many inventions.<a name=222:6></a> Any of these inventions sought after in the will of man is sin; for though it might not be evil in itself, the fact of its being sought or enjoyed in independence of God makes it sin.<a name=222:7></a> Seeing, therefore, that there is no soundness in the flesh, from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot, how are we to cease from sin?<a name=222:8></a> It is evident that, as there is no good thing <i>in</i> the flesh, no good can come <i>out</i> of it; the spring is corrupt; and hence, the only way to check sin, or to cease from it, is by subjecting the sin in the flesh to death; in fact, carrying out what is termed in Scripture, "dead to sin".<a name=222:9></a> The point I must first arrive at is, that nothing good is in the flesh, and that if any good comes from me - anything pleasing to God - it must come apart from the flesh, even from the Spirit of God.<a name=222:10></a> The body with a will in it is the flesh; without a will, it is Christ's servant.<a name=222:11></a>

		Now the first cause of great damage to souls is ignorance of what sin is; they do not know it, so as to be able to discern it, for the conscience cannot wince when there is no sense of unholiness, and yet there may be damage to the soul, though it be ignorant for the moment of the cause of the damage.<a name=223:12></a> We read, "If a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcase of an unclean beast, or a carcase of unclean cattle, or the carcase of unclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from him; he also shall be unclean, and guilty".<a name=223:13></a> (<a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#5:2">Leviticus  5:2</a>.<a name=223:14></a>) We come in contact with much that is unholy, and though there be grief thereby to the Holy Spirit in us, there is no pain to our conscience, because we are not enlightened

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In order the better to expose the incorrect ways by which we try to cease from sin, I will specify some particular sins.<a name=224:9></a> There are two classes of sins - one, the lusts that are to be mortified; the other, the ways that are to be put off.<a name=224:10></a> Take covetousness, for instance - that is a lust, and one which includes the most common, and often most excused, sin.<a name=224:11></a> It is idolatry, an uncontrolled desire to obtain anything.<a name=224:12></a> When a soul is in this state, lust has conceived, and it is sin, though the desire may not be fulfilled or carried into effect.<a name=224:13></a> Now the way to cease from this, is not by simply praying, even with great resolutions, that the desire may be taken away, or avoiding the object, or order of things, which feeds it - though one cannot too distinctly own it before the Lord, or too absolutely avoid every place or circumstance where the desire would be encouraged - but this might go on year after year without there being any ceasing from it; nay, these very exercises, though right as far as they go, would give that measure of relief which lulls the conscience for the moment, but is sure to be followed by a

		If I see fruit, and feel pleasure in finding that I could take it without being detected, then, even though I have not taken it, I have sinned; lust has conceived.<a name=225:9></a> But if, when I see it, I have a sense of pain instead of pleasure in seeing what I might do, I suffer in the flesh, I have ceased from sin therein.<a name=225:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is very evident that there is not a sense of the darkness or unholiness of lust of any kind, but as there is a ruling sense of the beauty of the contrast of the nature which was in Christ, which could not see anything to draw it aside, in the most inviting object here to which, as man, He had no right; and we know that even what He had right to He would not accept from any one but God, who only is good.<a name=225:11></a>

		The blessed God said of Job to Satan, "Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?<a name=232:3></a>" Yet Job had to learn this experience; it was not merely that he learned that God abhors the flesh in its best estate, but Job himself was brought first to a sense that he was "vile" (see chapter 40: 4), which the soul of the sinner must feel before God, but next he must learn that there is nothing in Him to suit God, so that, not only does his satisfaction in his own amiability give way, not only does he say "I am vile" but he cannot tolerate himself before God; he abhors and repudiates himself and repents in dust and ashes.<a name=232:4></a>

		However clear one is as to the doctrine of grace, that is, our absolute need of receiving pardon from a holy God, through the blood of Christ, yet this sense may be partial, and may be limited to the need of forgiveness and the conviction of absolute nothingness and imperfection may not be known for a long time after.<a name=233:2></a> Nay, how many, after the knowledge of forgiveness, seek to keep the law, making it the rule of life, and the measure of holiness.<a name=233:3></a> Such are barred from a knowledge of the height, in every line, as I have stated, because they have not reached the experience of Job, even "I abhor myself".<a name=233:4></a>

		Let us look at some examples.<a name=233:5></a> No one ever gets clear of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>who has not reached this experience; it is the lack of it which detains souls in the struggles of that chapter.<a name=233:6></a> There is, as we see there, the sense of what is right.<a name=233:7></a> Nay, there is delight in the law of God after the inner man, and yet no deliverance until he comes to this, "in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing".<a name=233:8></a> However amiable you are, when you come to this, you must abhor yourself, and then you can say heartily, I have nothing more to do with myself.<a name=233:9></a> "I thank God through Jesus Christ".<a name=233:10></a> I turn over absolutely and completely to the Lord Jesus Christ, and in Him I get power to fulfil the desires of His nature.<a name=233:11></a>

		Thus also for devotedness.<a name=234:3></a> There never was an instance of real devotedness yet until the soul had entered into the experience of being entirely indebted to Christ, concurrent with the sense of being <i>unfit</i> for Him.<a name=234:4></a> Like Peter in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#5">Luke  5</a>, when his conduct was excellent, and when he was receiving miraculous favour from God, he exclaims, "Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord".<a name=234:5></a> In the midst of everything commendable he loses self-respect, and having found in Christ that which set him without fear in the presence of God, which evidently his own conduct and even God's favours to him had failed to do, he leaves all and follows Him.<a name=234:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus also for service.<a name=234:7></a> The servant is never fitted for his work until he has seen, like Moses or Isaiah, that he is nothing before God, but that being nothing, and undone, he has acceptance with God.<a name=234:8></a> If the servant has not reached this experience, he is self-confident; he is like Moses using his own hands in the service of the Lord (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#2:12">Exodus  2:12</a>); he has no support, no base to fall back on when violently assailed.<a name=234:9></a> It is a moment of unparalleled blessing to the servant when these two things are concurrently known to him, the sense, that in himself there is nothing to trust in, but that with God there is perfect favour and countenance.<a name=234:10></a> Then is he ready for <i>any</i> service, but <i>not till then</i>.<a name=234:11></a>

		Once we are impressed with the greatness of the coming rest in the mind of God, and how His heart centres in that day when "he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing", we cannot fail to see how necessary and affecting is the exhortation, "Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it".<a name=242:2></a> Is that day when the blessed God shall rejoice, in that He has gathered in all around Himself in the perfection of Christ, the one great day that our hearts are set on?<a name=242:3></a> Is every other day here a day of toil, with no thought of any rest until then?<a name=242:4></a> The principle of the working man who engages to work for the six days of the week, with no prospect of rest or cessation till Sunday, is the one we should inculcate and foster; that is, to engage to work, and not to look for any rest until the great day of <i>His</i> rest is ushered in.<a name=242:5></a>

		which in themselves prove how indispensable rest is, are present, and are to be enjoyed now.<a name=243:1></a> But besides these two, there is another required in a world of evil and sorrow, a complete and eternal rest - God's rest, which, as we have seen, is the great end set before us; and it is here that the temptation or the delusion obtains or occurs.<a name=243:2></a> The temptation is to stop short of this, and to seek a measure of rest here.<a name=243:3></a> Are we to seek or to accept a temporary lull, an infinitely inferior rest here; or are we so truly in the mind of the Lord that we refuse the idea of any rest until the day and hour when He rests?<a name=243:4></a> Is His rest the one eternal definite goal before our hearts?<a name=243:5></a>

		There is another head or form of deception by which saints are drawn away from His rest.<a name=245:1></a> Jacob furnishes us with an example of it.<a name=245:2></a> He, after much conflict and exercise of heart, is quietly established in the land; but instead of God's rest being the only haven for him, he stops short of it, and is induced to settle at Shalem.<a name=245:3></a> No doubt, after all his toil, he naturally wished for rest; but ere long he found out, as every saint bitterly learns, "This is not your rest: because it is polluted.<a name=245:4></a>.<a name=245:5></a>".<a name=245:6></a> What is so remarkable in Jacob is that he continues to be religious; he builds an altar, and does not appear to have surrendered any of the truth which had been committed to him; but he failed, and exposed himself to the judgment on the world, because he sought his rest in it.<a name=245:7></a> Surely whenever we do so we shall find that the world "hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have been slain by her.<a name=245:8></a> Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death".<a name=245:9></a>

		Under these three heads there are innumerable subdivisions, like so many roads, one or another presenting something to draw away the heart with a promise of rest here - a cessation of toil.<a name=245:10></a> Many a one works on assiduously, buoyed up with the hope of being able, at some more or less distant time, to cease his labours, and retire and enjoy the fruits of his industry.<a name=245:11></a> Every desire and intention of the kind in the saint, when allowed, betrays that the heart is not simply and truly set on His rest.<a name=245:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In conclusion I would say that there are two things which keep and sustain the heart which is set for His rest.<a name=245:13></a> One is the word of God, which ever detects and exposes what is of the flesh, and what would detain us in the wilderness; and this by insisting on and inculcating the mind of God, which is the very opposite to man's natural mind.<a name=245:14></a> The other is the intercession of Christ, providing everyone led by the word with His grace, because in His sympathy He knows our need; and thus we are supported and cheered, while adhering to the

		The first thing, then, that constitutes a heavenly man is that he has eternal life.<a name=248:1></a> This is the life "more abundantly".<a name=248:2></a> The Lord sets forth in <a href="../bible/John.htm#10">John  10</a>how He takes His sheep out of the Jewish fold.<a name=248:3></a> He is the good Shepherd, who gives His life for the sheep, because they were under the judgment of death; but besides this, He adds, "I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish".<a name=248:4></a> Now eternal life leads us into an entirely new fellowship.<a name=248:5></a> "Our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ".<a name=248:6></a> "This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent".<a name=248:7></a> This is an entirely new capacity; there are three witnesses to establish it, the spirit and the water and the blood.<a name=248:8></a> "And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son".<a name=248:9></a> We are also His brethren, as He said to Mary Magdalene, "Go to my brethren", etc.<a name=248:10></a> Now is fulfilled the word in <a href="../bible/John.htm#12:24">John  12:24</a>, "Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit".<a name=248:11></a> The Lord can now call us brethren, and He announces where He will be, when He says, "I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God".<a name=248:12></a> It is in connection with this that the Lord breathes on His disciples.<a name=248:13></a> It is a life entirely outside and apart from the scene of man's ruin, and in the scene where righteousness and peace kiss each other.<a name=248:14></a> Hence, when the Holy Spirit comes down from heaven, He unites us with Christ our Saviour, who is in heaven; so that we not only know where He, our Life, is in scenes of boundless light and glory, and we united to Him there; but the heaven is opened to Stephen in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7">Acts  7</a>, as developing the true position and association of the believer now.<a name=248:15></a> And he is, as I may say, in the power of Christ's life here, as one with Him, so that he enters into the victory of Christ for him with regard to each and every thing against him, as detailed in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>, from sin down to the horns of the unicorn.<a name=248:16></a> So truly is he a heavenly man that he can persevere in his service, even

		Next, as we see in the apostle Paul, a heavenly man learns that, while he can entirely and happily die out of all here with the cheerful anticipation of heaven, yet he is to continue here, seeking "those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God".<a name=249:4></a> He is a citizen of heaven, while journeying here, and waiting for the coming of the Lord, when the time of His rejection will be over.<a name=249:5></a> Stephen <i>dies</i> a heavenly man; he has the joys and testimony of one.<a name=249:6></a> Paul <i>lives</i> a heavenly man; and as his testimony is prolonged, there are greater trials, but there are also greater and fuller joys.<a name=249:7></a> A heavenly man in his sojourn here enjoys the special favour of God.<a name=249:8></a> His position on earth can be simply described by the words, "A land which the Lord thy God careth for: the eyes of the Lord thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year", and it "drinketh water of the rain of heaven".<a name=249:9></a> A believer sustained here only by the rain from heaven is the only antitype to the possessor of the land; and consequently all spiritual blessings are given to him.<a name=249:10></a> There is really no true knowledge of the "heavenly things" but as one is in Canaan - as one is a heavenly man on earth.<a name=249:11></a> A believer may know the "earthly things", the work of grace in his soul, but all his associations are with earth, like a willow tree.<a name=249:12></a> But sonship, acceptance in the Beloved, priesthood, Christ as Head of His body the church, the One to give gifts unto man, can only be enjoyed by a heavenly man.<a name=249:13></a> And finally, as to testimony, no one can represent the rejected Christ in heaven, except a heavenly man, one who receives grace and power from Himself to stand for Him where He is not.<a name=249:14></a> So that nothing can be simpler, however humbling because of our distance from it, than that our

		The testimony in a few words is, first, that all the sin, misery and judgment entailed on man through Adam's sin has been removed by the second Man, the Lord from heaven, by His death and blood-shedding; and as birth involved us in the one, so does faith obtain for us the benefits of the other.<a name=250:2></a> Adam and his race, as the Scriptures testify, have failed in every position in which God was pleased to put them.<a name=250:3></a> When this was fully disclosed, God sent His Son: "The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us".<a name=250:4></a> There was a Man on earth entirely according to the mind of God: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased" - the Son of man which is in heaven.<a name=250:5></a> The testimony then is, first, that Christ by His work has cleared every believer of the sin of Adam, and through grace, his state before God is not now in Adam but in Christ.<a name=250:6></a> This, which is properly the gospel, entirely supersedes the first man, placing the believer in perfect peace and blessed acceptance in new creation before God.<a name=250:7></a> This, as has been said, is our ministry.<a name=250:8></a> The other or second part of the testimony is that each believer is now a member of the body of Christ, united to Him in heaven by the Holy Spirit sent down, and also united to one another by the same Spirit; and in the latter is completed the word of God.<a name=250:9></a> (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:25">Colossians  1:25</a>)

	<div class="paragraph">
		There are in the christian infancy two distinct experiences.<a name=289:1></a> The first is when the soul, awaked to the impending judgment of God, sees that Christ is the propitiation through faith in His blood.<a name=289:2></a> This is an unspeakable relief to the sin-oppressed conscience in terror of judgment.<a name=289:3></a> The sense that safety is assured through the intervention of the One able to effect it, because He bore what was due to us, and that God can say, "when I see the blood, I will pass over you" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#12:13">Exodus  12:13</a>), is the first and necessary experience of the guilty soul.<a name=289:4></a> This must be ever the first experience.<a name=289:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The ruined sinner must first be assured of the grace which meets his need in the sight of God.<a name=289:6></a> It is when there is no hope on our side that we appreciate the greatness of the grace which clears us before Him.<a name=289:7></a> There is "redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins", <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:14">Colossians  1:14</a>.<a name=289:8></a> We are set free from judgment, because the sins which had entailed judgment have been forgiven, and I am, as it were, cured.<a name=289:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in addition to this, there is another experience; there is a sense of being brought nigh to God - that we are come to Jesus.<a name=289:10></a> That is, we have not only received grace from Him, even as the blood intercepted the judgment impending on Israel in Egypt, but we are come to God.<a name=289:11></a> We come near the One who is in the bosom of the Father, and hath declared Him.<a name=289:12></a> In the one case the grace is made known to faith - "when he beheld.<a name=289:13></a>.<a name=289:14></a>.<a name=289:15></a> he lived"; in the other there is a coming to the One from whom the grace has come.<a name=289:16></a> The experience of Israel when sheltered under the blood-sprinkled lintel answered to one, and when they sang the song on the other side of the Red Sea, to the other.<a name=289:17></a> The first is our escape from the destroying angel, which is known as soon as accepted; the second is only reached through an exercise that

		Now there can be a long interval between these two experiences, and while there is often much devotion and zeal when the first only is known, yet there is no stability, nor a distinct true testimony in real joy of heart until the other is known.<a name=290:7></a> Noah is safe in the ark, shut in by God; but he has not an altar until he is enjoying the sweet savour of the burnt offering, and then it is no longer escape from judgment, but the assured favour of God, where a few months before he was rescued from judgment, through His grace, in the ark.<a name=290:8></a> Abram believed God when He promised him that his seed should be as the stars of the sky, but he was not confirmed in the vastness and truth of this promise until he offered up his son; and then he could speak of God as Jehovah Jireh - "in the mount of the Lord it shall be seen", <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#22:14">Genesis  22:14</a>.<a name=290:9></a> We see in these examples a distinct interval between these two experiences, simply because the first great conflict is connected with the second experience and not with the first.<a name=290:10></a> In the case of Noah and Abram, they each in the first received distinct and manifest grace; but in the other, they had to do with God, a blessing which they reached only after deep exercise of soul; and this I call the first great conflict, without which there can be no progress or stability.<a name=290:11></a> The woman who touched the hem of Christ's garment, in the clear and

		beautiful faith consequent on a divine revelation to her soul, expresses the first; but there was no confirmation of this great blessing, although it was possessed, until she submitted to the great conflict induced by coming into the presence of the Saviour.<a name=291:1></a> She had no reluctance nor hesitancy in appropriating the cure that grace provided and conferred on her by touching Him, but she shrank from the second.<a name=291:2></a> She was fearing and trembling, though knowing what was done in her, because of the conflict.<a name=291:3></a> In coming, she must lose sight of herself in the presence of the Lord.<a name=291:4></a> She "fell down before him, and told him all the truth", <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#5:33">Mark  5:33</a>.<a name=291:5></a> A soul may believe now in the virtue of Christ's blood in the eye of God, and be sensibly converted and assured of eternal safety, and still may never yet have come into the presence of Christ, now in glory.<a name=291:6></a> He may never have learned the gospel of the glory of Christ; never in faith been led by the Spirit into the new and living way through the veil, that is, His flesh; never been sensibly outside the Adam condition, and in the simple liberty of the Spirit of God near the Saviour - as near as the woman, the sinner, in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7">Luke  7</a>.<a name=291:7></a> She was only so naturally, but we are so now spiritually.<a name=291:8></a>

		Saul of Tarsus at his conversion entered into both these experiences; but even then there was an interval between them.<a name=291:9></a> He had seen the light, and had heard the voice, but he did not pass through the first great conflict until the three days during which he did neither eat nor drink.<a name=291:10></a> He learned the cross then - that everything which could cause a shade of difference between him and God was removed, and that there was no place for man in the flesh before God; and now, praying, he receives the Holy Spirit.<a name=291:11></a> The real objection to the gospel of the glory of Christ is the conflict which is entailed on the soul in apprehending it or entering into it.<a name=291:12></a> To receive grace to set me free from a troubled conscience and fear of future judgment makes no exaction on the natural man; it confers an immense gain on him.<a name=291:13></a> Even if religious duties or sacrifices be imposed on him, he can

		cheerfully accede to them as praiseworthy, and an evidence to his own heart of the great work which doubtless has been wrought in him.<a name=292:1></a> But he has never passed through the first great conflict; he has never found himself in spirit beside a Saviour in glory, and learnt that no flesh could glory in His presence.<a name=292:2></a> This accounts for the amount of zealous works which may be done by one still ignorant of the power of resurrection.<a name=292:3></a> Moses was converted when he refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, but he was not in divine power until, as an unshod worshipper, he listened to the voice of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush, and the bush was not consumed.<a name=292:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Until the second experience was reached there must be a check to progress, because though the soul, through grace, has received the grace of God averting the judgment due to us, there is yet no conscious setting aside of man in the presence of God, and hence no opportunity of adopting the manner and condition of Christ.<a name=292:5></a> It is not only, "When he beheld.<a name=292:6></a>.<a name=292:7></a>.<a name=292:8></a> he lived", but also, "If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink", <a href="../bible/John.htm#7:37">John  7:37</a>.<a name=292:9></a> The power and Spirit of Christ come with the second, but this is because of the displacement and refusal of the old man which must take place on one coming so near the Lord.<a name=292:10></a> There is often a prolonged interval between these two, and while it is so there can be no real progress, except on approaching the conflict which introduces into the divine line of things.<a name=292:11></a> The widow of Sarepta can enjoy for a whole year - that is, every variety of season here - an immunity from fear of death through the presence of the prophet, and all this time have no idea of his power over death.<a name=292:12></a> Nay, on the contrary, after a period that typifies one's whole life on earth, she was reduced to despair, because her only son had died.<a name=292:13></a> She had never known the prophet on the other side of death.<a name=292:14></a> There are souls in the present hour, happy in Christ's work in rescuing them from death, who are sheltered under His present care, as it was known to

	<div class="paragraph">
		to be adopted by him here; consequently he assumed the mantle which fell from Elijah.<a name=294:1></a> It is evident that Elisha was devoted in heart and purpose to Elijah, when nothing could satisfy him, as remaining behind him, but a double portion of his spirit, and that on getting it he would require no more; but yet, nothing that he had hitherto done or enjoyed would entitle him to this great boon.<a name=294:2></a> To obtain it he must see him taken.<a name=294:3></a> In this day the servant of the Lord has no greater task than the endeavour to lead believers into this second experience, or, as the apostle calls it, the excellency of the knowledge of Christ; but this excellency was only acquired at the expense of man in his best estate.<a name=294:4></a> "What things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ", <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3:7">Philippians  3:7</a>.<a name=294:5></a> The glory of Christ is the seal of the satisfaction of God in the accomplishment of the work which He gave His Son to do.<a name=294:6></a> "I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.<a name=294:7></a> And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self", <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:5">John  17:5</a>.<a name=294:8></a> There can be no real progress, nor true joy of soul, until Christ in glory is known personally by the believer.<a name=294:9></a> For as it was through death, and the setting aside of the old man in the cross, that the glory was reached by our Lord, so no one now can reach Him there but through the same way; and this is the first great conflict known to the soul.<a name=294:10></a>

		The servant now is often baffled and hindered by earnest and true men who, feeling their own ignorance of this great experience, and sensible of the cost it would involve, sometimes pronounce it unattainable or impossible; and again by others who say it is very high truth, instead of seeing that there cannot be progress unless the soul has consciously reached Christ in glory.<a name=294:11></a> Many good works can be done, and much of the scripture can be known, and yet it is plain that such an one does not date or derive from God.<a name=294:12></a> Man with his wants, it will be found, is the guide and measure of the walk and service of everyone who does not know Christ in glory.<a name=294:13></a>

		ordination embraces all christian ministers, whether episcopalian, presbyterian, or dissenters.<a name=309:1></a> These ministers preach the gospel - that a soul is saved not by works, but by faith in Christ, the only sacrifice and ransom for our sins.<a name=309:2></a> They themselves have faith in His blood, and they one and all preach this, though some do so more fervently and effectively than others.<a name=309:3></a> They generally have but two great objects before them in their ministry; one that the soul should be saved, the other that the converted one should be a good citizen of the world.<a name=309:4></a> There cannot be any higher practical life flowing from it than this; for if the sum of Christ's work is only to save me from judgment which is still future (for however truly assured I am of it by the word of God and the work of faith in my soul, yet it is future, and at best I can happily contemplate the future), the only gain I have in the present is that I am not afraid of the future, and the conscience is at rest so long as the law is kept in the eye and judgment of man.<a name=309:5></a> The fruit or disciples of this ministry enjoy neither Christ in heaven nor the Holy Spirit on earth.<a name=309:6></a> They have not His comfort and support, and but rarely the sense of the relationship which He expresses.<a name=309:7></a> The christians under this ministry necessarily do not go further than the Jews in the millennial day - clear of judgment, because the blood of Christ has availed to ransom them; their duty being now to walk here according to the law, the law the rule of life.<a name=309:8></a> Hence, according to their means, and as the providence of God has blessed them here, they are good members of society, and faithful supporters in word and deed of the church or system to which they belong, which in a great measure defines and constitutes their testimony.<a name=309:9></a> In a word, they are good religious worldly men; this is the fruit of the ordained christian minister.<a name=309:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the next class of unordained ministers surpasses the preceding one in knowledge, if I may so say.<a name=310:9></a> They understand in word the scriptural idea of the church of God; at least, they hold the fundamental truth that "where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them".<a name=310:10></a> This is the foundation principle which these avow, and they assert that they meet according to it; but in practice they do not support their assertion, because they do not hold themselves responsible to exclude every believer, at any and every distance, who is knowingly in contact, directly or indirectly, with doctrine or morals dishonouring to Christ.<a name=310:11></a> Now the ministry in this class extends beyond

	<div class="paragraph">
		the mere gospel to sinners, though for the most part it is confined to that.<a name=311:1></a> There is in their meetings, besides a measure of light on Scripture, a general knowledge of the dispensations, and often zeal and earnestness in pressing faith and confidence in God, with practical brotherly love.<a name=311:2></a> The disciples or adherents of this class, though avowedly separate from systems and the world, are really defective in the mainspring of all godly separation.<a name=311:3></a> They do not understand the unity of the Spirit; they are not really in the known leading and power of the Holy Spirit; they seek and insist on the unity of believers, but the unity of the Spirit, which they must uphold were they walking in the Spirit themselves, they cannot enter into, and therefore they cannot keep it.<a name=311:4></a> They never understand the true place and portion of the saints on earth, and even though godly, they are not in heart and spirit weaned from the world; and their chief service, as I have intimated, is not to the saints, because they have not the truth which would edify them.<a name=311:5></a> Hence their zeal and energies are directed to the unconverted, and thus they relieve their consciences of the service and edification which should be rendered to the converted.<a name=311:6></a> They are true plants, but, like forest trees in a flowerpot, never grow to any stature, though apparently right in outline and purpose.<a name=311:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next class to this are quite clear as to the unity of the Spirit, and hold in a very uncompromising way decided separation from everyone who, directly or indirectly, by contact or otherwise, is indifferent to the name and honour of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=311:8></a> They are zealously true to the principles of the church of God on earth.<a name=311:9></a> But though they enjoy and help on the worship in the assembly, and delight in the saint's growth in deliverance and peace, they are more evangelical than simply for the church; and hence in the assembly their teaching has as a rule more of an individual than a corporate character.<a name=311:10></a> The gospel is before the church in their heart, though they know church truth; and their

		care for the saints is more as individuals than as either the house of God on earth or the body of Christ.<a name=312:1></a> If I am alive to the magnitude of the church as the dwelling-place of God through the Spirit sent down from heaven, then, if I labour in christendom in the gospel, I come forth to so-called christians conscious of the support and of the co-operation of the Holy Spirit.<a name=312:2></a> But if I do not start from this, I shall not be wholly dependent on the Holy Spirit, and shall drop into the use of means and human expedients in order to obtain a hearing; and the moment I do so, and the more I do so, I not only lose sight of the support and co-operation of the Holy Spirit, but I am sensibly diminishing my own confidence in Him and consequently my individual benefit from Him.<a name=312:3></a> I most freely own that God has blessed the labours of these ministers; but as there had been human means mixed up with the work, it is seldom that the fruit of their labours are led out into a decided spiritual prominence.<a name=312:4></a> For though the converts and disciples of this ministry accept the truth concerning the church of God, and are clear of man's systems, they rarely get clear of the human element, there is a half-and-half way about them; they are strict and correct in attending the breaking of bread, but generally indifferent to other meetings, except the preaching of the gospel.<a name=312:5></a> Almost all children betray the defects of their parents more conspicuously than their perfections, and so it is with the disciples of any ministry.<a name=312:6></a> The ministers of this class doubtless enjoy more than they speak of, but they seldom present the heavenly portion of the saints; their teachings are generally Christ's present care of His people, and how faith in Him is needed for everything here, and marvellously answered.<a name=312:7></a> Many of them are bright examples of the truth brought out in the epistle to the Romans.<a name=312:8></a> They know the truth of Ephesians, but it does not appear to be their line or aim.<a name=312:9></a>

		There are two parts of the grace of God to us: one, the completeness of deliverance which has been effected for us by the work of Christ; the other, the greatness of the things which God hath prepared for us.<a name=326:7></a> And there are two lines of teaching: one is relative to the first part of grace, the completeness of our deliverance; this must be insisted on by the servant of Christ, whatever the state in which the believer is found.<a name=326:8></a> This first part of God's grace is a whole in itself; though it is not satisfied without the other, it is distinct and definite in itself, just as a man's life is distinct from the place or society where it could find perfect and unceasing enjoyment.<a name=326:9></a> This first part of grace, I repeat, must be insisted on; however low the state of the believer, the efficacy of Christ's work to deliver him from all his ruin should be presented to him, though, like a serpent-bitten Israelite, he only lifts his eyes to the brazen serpent that he believes could relieve him.<a name=326:10></a> The faithful servant presses on souls the fulness of grace which awaits them.<a name=326:11></a> The danger is lest the servant should mistake a lesser state for the true one, and then either fail to set forth and press the true and full christian state, where only there would be vigour and health, or - as is the case with some earnest teachers - attempt to

		lead them into the second part of grace, feeding them with meat before they are able to bear it; and this is of great injury to them in many ways.<a name=327:1></a> It is therefore of great importance that the servant should know the effects or the characteristics of the true state.<a name=327:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I suggest that <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15">Exodus  15</a>in a very striking way defines the characteristics of the first part.<a name=327:3></a> It is a song.<a name=327:4></a> There is joy in the heart in reciting and expressing the blessed effects of the grace of God.<a name=327:5></a> First there is triumph, because the Lord hath triumphed gloriously.<a name=327:6></a> It is the Lord who is before the heart, and His triumph; the simple and assured evidence of the brightness and heartiness of faith.<a name=327:7></a> It discerns Him where He is, the triumphant One in glory; the heart sings in blessed consciousness of this.<a name=327:8></a> It is the experience of Stephen; he looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus.<a name=327:9></a> No eye can rest on Jesus there without the sense and assurance of triumph pervading the soul.<a name=327:10></a> We derive from Him who represents us there; and thus we represent Him here.<a name=327:11></a> "As he is, so are we in this world".<a name=327:12></a> This is one characteristic.<a name=327:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second is that an entirely new interest now opens out to our heart.<a name=327:14></a> It is no longer our own distinction or concerns here; it is the glory of God.<a name=327:15></a> "I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God, and I will exalt him".<a name=327:16></a> If I have been fully and triumphantly delivered from all the consequences of sin and judgment, and all the power of evil, surely it is but meet and right that in the place of my deliverance, like David in his day, the Lord's house should commemorate the spot where His grace so blessedly reached me.<a name=327:17></a> If I have been gloriously cleared of all the evil, where the evil is, what less could I do than be occupied with God in that very place?<a name=327:18></a> "I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids, until I find out a place for the Lord, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob", <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#132:4">Psalm  132:4</a>, 5.<a name=327:19></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These characteristics, though very great, and most blessed, mark the only true christian state.<a name=328:4></a> I find several states of soul between the moment of conversion and this, but I cannot accept as the right one any other than this, however interesting and commendatory it may be.<a name=328:5></a> Hence, I cannot allow any state to be the true one but the one which is marked by these characteristics.<a name=328:6></a> I should not make light of any lesser state of soul; but as I know the state of real health, I cannot, as an honest physician, allow anyone to suppose he has reached it when he has not.<a name=328:7></a> I prescribe for health, and though rejoiced at any and every progress towards it, I cannot allow souls to call a lower experience by the name of a higher one.<a name=328:8></a> There is hardly anything more mischievous than that one should be deluded into the idea of possessing a great benefit which he does not possess; for he is thus prevented from seeking or accepting it, though all the while it is at his very hand, because he is labouring under the delusion that he already has it.<a name=328:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If I find a soul thankful that he is under the shelter of the blood of Christ, as <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#12">Exodus  12</a>typifies, I have to cheer and encourage him by the fulness of grace in chapter 15.<a name=328:10></a> I know that he will have to pass through all the stages between chapters 12 and 15 eventually; but my service is to present to him the Lord who has triumphed gloriously, Himself crucified having cleared the ground; and I keep pressing the first part of grace in its full and perfect measure.<a name=328:11></a> "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved".<a name=328:12></a> I am not to deceive myself that he is in the true christian state because he

		breathes.<a name=329:1></a> If I deceive myself I am sure to deceive him, and many who would not be deceived in this first state might be so by some of the subsequent ones.<a name=329:2></a> For instance, how touching and interesting is one in real condition of soul eating of the roasted lamb, dwelling on Christ as the Sin-bearer.<a name=329:3></a> Such an one, though very exemplary for piety and devotion, is yet not in the deep-toned melody of Christ's triumphs.<a name=329:4></a> Again, I may see others bravely and persistently walking away from the world, their loins girt, their staff in their hand, and their shoes on their feet, eating the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth, in their purpose to get clear of the judgment on Egypt; but they are not yet in triumph, and they have none of the characteristics I have spoken of.<a name=329:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, others can truly and rapturously speak of the manner in which salvation has been wrought out.<a name=329:6></a> They literally see the salvation of God; they see by faith how the blessed Lord entered into death, and they see Him combating with unchecked power all the mighty deep.<a name=329:7></a> They are assured of salvation and deeply affected at the manner of His grace; but yet they are not in the song that celebrates His finished work and describes the effects produced by it.<a name=329:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now if it be incumbent on the servant to keep the first part of grace before the soul of the believer, and not to let him rest in anything short of life, and that in its vigour or health; it is also his duty, and of the greatest moment for the soul's blessing, not to present the other part of grace until the soul is able to bear it.<a name=329:9></a> Paul says of the Corinthians, "I.<a name=329:10></a>.<a name=329:11></a>.<a name=329:12></a> could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.<a name=329:13></a> I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3:1">1 Corinthians  3:1</a>, 2.<a name=329:14></a> In the former chapter he says, with reference to wisdom, "we speak wisdom among them that are perfect".<a name=329:15></a> The Corinthians were babes because, though they had learned the fulness of grace as to their place before God, they had not accepted the

		Happily for us, the scripture answers the question by giving us the heads of all events before us, namely, "The morning cometh, and also the night".<a name=331:1></a> Blessed be God, the great and leading subject is the morning, the "morning without clouds"; and the harbinger of that great moment is "the bright and morning star".<a name=331:2></a> The coming of our Lord, when we shall meet Him in the air, is the special hope given to us; and unless this hope forms and defines the end of all our expectation, there will be a defective way of looking at the night.<a name=331:3></a> It is, "in thy light shall we see light"; and it is as we have the brightness of His coming before us as our one simple, unmixed hope, that we shall be able, in the light of it, to form a true judgment of what is transpiring in the night.<a name=331:4></a> Unless the coming of the Lord is before me, I have not the true hope of the church before me, and all my works and services will be characterised by this defect.<a name=331:5></a> Without this hope I cannot have a true object for my heart, and if I have not, I cannot prevent other things from taking a place in my heart; so that the coming of the Lord, the harbinger of the day, must be my only polar star.<a name=331:6></a> What other hope could guide or cheer me but the return of Him who, having loved me and given Himself for me, has left me here during His absence to do His pleasure, in company with His own; and while pursuing with diligence the service that He has appointed to me, never to lose sight of that moment when I shall see Him and be like Him.<a name=331:7></a> Thus the morning star must be the hope of the true heart, and the way to judge of everything must be in the light of that day.<a name=331:8></a> The brightest moment is the one on which my heart is fixed, whatever intervenes; and because I am thus assured of it, and independent of all present things, I can truly and calmly analyse the nature of them; not to discover anything to divert me from my hope, but to ascertain anything and everything which would contribute to the name of my absent

		This was refused and refuted by those who had learned that Christ in heaven was the Head of His body on earth, insisting on the truth that the wise virgins had oil in their vessels; that the right or privilege of every believer is to be sealed by the Spirit.<a name=333:1></a> Thus the gleam of light which had made a track for itself through the darkness of the night grew stronger and brighter.<a name=333:2></a> These truths as they were received greatly helped souls.<a name=333:3></a> The certainty of Christ's finished work placing the believer not only in assurance of safety, but in his acceptance with God, was new and incontrovertible.<a name=333:4></a> How could a believer have Christ as his Head in heaven, unless he was first accepted in the Beloved; and how could he be here, united to the members of the body of Christ, if he had not received the Holy Spirit, which is the seal of being established in Christ?<a name=333:5></a> This truth, the true and only ground for peace, or life, or church position, was opposed in many ways.<a name=333:6></a> The drift of Puseyism was trying in some way to quiet the conscience by bodily exercise.<a name=333:7></a> Alas!<a name=333:8></a> many were thus turned away from the light.<a name=333:9></a> Satan had seen further for evil than his agents; and he had prepared the hood or blind for them before the light reached them.<a name=333:10></a> Many were propped up and deceived by devotional exercises as the means of obtaining rest for their consciences, long before the faintest glimmer of the light reached their eyes; so that when it did, they rejected or opposed it.<a name=333:11></a> Justification by faith was not opposed, but the certainty of full acceptance with God in Christ was utterly refused at first, because this truth leaves no place for religion in the flesh.<a name=333:12></a> Another form of opposition was the doctrine that Christ by incarnation connected Himself with man, in order to raise and restore the old stock, and not, as according to Scripture, that He died for all, and that, rising again, every one in Him is a new creation.<a name=333:13></a> It was reformation, not transformation.<a name=333:14></a> It is evident that this theory, which was openly taught in print, secretly and wickedly sought to divert the souls from the light.<a name=333:15></a>

		On this followed from within - that is, from among those who had accepted the light - a very serious defection from it, and one of great warning.<a name=334:1></a> It was taught, and influence was gained by the teaching, that the church will be in the tribulation; thus indirectly, and for a time unsuspectedly, the light was ignored by its professors, which up to this had survived many an opposition, and had penetrated far and wide.<a name=334:2></a> If the church be in the judgment, then it is not the body of Christ, bound to Him the Head in heaven; it is simply as many would maintain, a congregation of all believers, from Abel down to the last one - and then there is no body at all.<a name=334:3></a> As this obtained, there was a return to form, and a practical denial of the Spirit's rule, and of the responsibility of the assembly to decide on matters of discipline; so that the principles which the light had disclosed and inculcated were rejected.<a name=334:4></a> Hence there was no option for the upright, for those really in the light, but distinct and absolute separation from this heresy, as it was eventually proved to be by the false doctrine which lay at the base of the system.<a name=334:5></a> It is to be noted here that leaven of independence which sprang up in connection with this opposition to the light has worked in many to this day, so that the very professors of the light are the great neutralisers of it - a great success to the power of darkness.<a name=334:6></a>

		WHAT IS KEEPING THE UNITY OF THE SPIRIT IN THE BOND OF PEACE?
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before we can endeavour to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:3">Ephesians  4:3</a>), in the only proper way, we must know what it is.<a name=337:13></a> The unity of the Spirit is the bond which binds into membership of the body of Christ every believer who has drunk of the same Spirit.<a name=337:14></a> We are
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=338>[Page 338]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		all baptised by one Spirit into one body.<a name=338:1></a> We are compacted together by that which every joint supplieth.<a name=338:2></a> Some members are of a higher order than others, and yet no member can act independently of the body, if the unity of the Spirit is to be kept in the bond of peace.<a name=338:3></a> The body of Christ is to become the system which is to determine my christian activity.<a name=338:4></a> I can at no time absolve myself from my responsibility to act; though, when acting as the servant of the Lord - not in the assembly - I am simply responsible to Him, using the gift which He has given me.<a name=338:5></a> In the assembly, the most gifted man is a member; he must be under Christ the Head of the church, he must act in relation to the body, and whatever he does, if he be led of the Lord, is accepted and admitted by one and all as if it were the act and sentiment of each one.<a name=338:6></a> It is adopted as one's own, just as the mouth speaks of what the eye sees, and the ear hears what the mouth speaks of as having been seen by the eye, and thus the ear adopts what the eye sees and the mouth speaks.<a name=338:7></a> The seeing, the speaking, and the hearing are common gain to all the members.<a name=338:8></a> When my natural ear hears an alarm of danger, my feet move away from it.<a name=338:9></a> In the same way, when my mouth expresses pleasure at meeting an acquaintance, my hand acts in correspondence with it by a warm salutation.<a name=338:10></a> The unity of the Spirit must first be understood, before there can be any true endeavour to keep it in the bond of peace.<a name=338:11></a> I could not understand what I am to keep, much less the manner in which I am to keep it, if I did not know it first.<a name=338:12></a> The reception of the Spirit is necessarily the first thing.<a name=338:13></a> If a believer has not received the Spirit - that is, if he is not sealed - he could never understand the unity of the Spirit; and the acceptance of the truth without the practical knowledge of it leads to very unhappy results; a great truth held as an idea, while the deep moral effect of it is unknown.<a name=338:14></a> The idea of the body is accepted, but the nature of the bond is literally unknown; and hence there is neither power nor sense as

	<div class="paragraph">
		to the way in which it is united together.<a name=339:1></a> They, the members, are expected to hold together, but the bond is unknown; and hence many and various devices and efforts are resorted to, to maintain a unity which has been accepted as a truth without a personal enjoyment of the Spirit who forms the unity.<a name=339:2></a> Hence the great thing in order to understand this great subject is the simple truth that any and every one to whom this exhortation is addressed is personally indwelt by the Spirit of God.<a name=339:3></a> I am, individually, not only set free through the work of Christ from all the ruin and misery under which I lay, but I am united to my Saviour where He is by the Holy Spirit sent down from heaven.<a name=339:4></a> And as this is the privilege and calling of every believer, as we have one Head, we are one body on the earth.<a name=339:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the next great truth opens out to the believer's soul.<a name=339:6></a> He is not only saved by Christ and united to Him where He is, but he is united to each one of His members here on earth.<a name=339:7></a> This is his new and distinctive position, and one he cannot at any time, or under any circumstances, forego or surrender.<a name=339:8></a> We shall see presently the varied positions in which a member of Christ is responsible, though not always in the same way; and, alas!<a name=339:9></a> how this great bond may be qualified or nullified by the working of the flesh - the opposite to grace - though it can never be fully abrogated.<a name=339:10></a> But as the unity of the Spirit is truly comprehended, the believer accepts and feels that he is in an entirely new position on earth, and one most difficult to insist on and maintain among men, privately as well as publicly, because there is nothing visible or perceptible in the bond.<a name=339:11></a> It is unseen, eternal, and invisible, but never obtaining acknowledgement from any of the human senses, in me or around me.<a name=339:12></a> It is an <i>imperium in imperio</i>, but while controlling the faithful to the utmost, it neither seeks nor obtains any succour or countenance from the human mind, so entirely is it beyond its scope and region.<a name=339:13></a> The believer, once acquainted with this bond, cannot but ever after be

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We shall now notice the manner and way of the uniting bond of peace in which he is to keep it.<a name=340:4></a> First, in the assembly gathered as such.<a name=340:5></a> The existence of the bond, the unity of the Spirit, necessarily precedes the known exercise of it in the assembly.<a name=340:6></a> It is in the assembly that the unity of the Spirit is fully and peculiarly in its own place.<a name=340:7></a> In it "the whole body, fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love", <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:16">Ephesians  4:16</a>.<a name=340:8></a> Here there cannot be any interruption in any part or member without loss to all.<a name=340:9></a> It is not uncommon, however, that some who take their places as really acquainted with this bond have not as yet tasted of it, and they do not enjoy what those do who are in real union or articulation.<a name=340:10></a> Nor, on the other hand, do they hinder or mar the fellowship as do those who are really united when grieving the Spirit.<a name=340:11></a> The Spirit in the assembly seeks full and unhindered action through every part.<a name=340:12></a> So that when one sees, everyone sees; when one speaks, everyone speaks, everyone coincides; when one speaks or prays, one and all are in accord.<a name=340:13></a> There is melody in the heart to the Lord.<a name=340:14></a> When, therefore, this first exercise of the unity is known and entered into, then this word applies: "Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace".<a name=340:15></a> Nothing can be more blessed or marvellous than any true sense of the unity of the body of Christ, and it cannot be enjoyed except in meetings simply and entirely under the rule and guidance of the Lord.<a name=340:16></a> I may add here that while the reality, like the anointing oil, is incomparable in excellence and virtue, the imitation is the weakest thing, and most derogatory to the name and honour of the Lord.<a name=340:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=341>[Page 341]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		While it is seen by many how it is that the assembly is the sphere of the unity of the Spirit, yet it is not clearly or distinctly held that this unity subsists and continues when we are not gathered into the one place.<a name=341:1></a> We therefore look now at the second place in which we find the member of Christ, namely, in individual service.<a name=341:2></a> In service thus the believer does not forego or overlook his great position as a member of the body of Christ.<a name=341:3></a> He is always under the Lord, and as he is always under Him, he must be always under the Head of the body, the church.<a name=341:4></a> As Christ's heart, blessed be His name, is centred in the church - He "loved the church, and gave himself for it" - so the servant subject to Him can never, in his individual service, run counter in any way to the unity of the Spirit.<a name=341:5></a> Nay, here also he endeavours to keep the unity of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace.<a name=341:6></a> That is, in no act or manner of service is he to deviate from the great and paramount duty.<a name=341:7></a> It is right and proper for him as an individual to fulfil the service to which he has been called, but this, as it is done under the Lord who is the Head of the body, must be truly and strictly "in the bond of peace".<a name=341:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thirdly, in my own circumstances, as I walk with the Lord, I cannot lose sight of my highest duty, though properly and righteously occupied with my lawful calling and duties in my own house.<a name=341:9></a> I must make my own personal interest and advantages subordinate to my first and greatest duty, and the place where through divine grace I enjoy the greatest privileges and blessings; and therefore in my family circle I study "with all lowliness and meekness" to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.<a name=341:10></a> If I had not this great claim, which entails on me great and untold enjoyment, I might pursue my own profit and advantages without violating in any way the moral law.<a name=341:11></a> I feel I must do a great deal more now.<a name=341:12></a> "If meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#8:13">1 Corinthians  8:13</a>.<a name=341:13></a> I must not look on my

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now let us turn for a moment and note the chief ways in which this great bond is disturbed or disregarded.<a name=342:4></a> We have seen how it must be respected in the assembly and individually, whether in service or at home.<a name=342:5></a> Now if in the assembly I either decline to use any functions committed to me for the good of the body, or assume a function not appointed to me by the Lord, I am not in all lowliness, but on the contrary, I am allowing flesh to rule me, and then I am not keeping the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace, I am a disturber.<a name=342:6></a> If I consult my own inclinations either way, I am not truly subject to the Lord, and therefore I cannot keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.<a name=342:7></a> If I refuse to hear the voice of the Lord uttered by a member, I am quenching the Spirit, instead of keeping His unity in the bond of peace.<a name=342:8></a> If I impose a hymn, or any ministry which is not of the Lord, however good in itself, I am self-confident, and I am breaking the peace.<a name=342:9></a> If I have anything to contribute and refuse to do so, because of any selfish reason, I am checking the Spirit, not only for myself but for all present.<a name=342:10></a> Much of this and of a like character is often found in the assembly, as we see from the epistle to the Corinthians.<a name=342:11></a> But the greatest hindrance to the peace occurs most frequently and injuriously in one's individual service.<a name=342:12></a> It is quite true that each member has an individual and, I might say, private responsibility to the Lord; but answering to this in the fullest manner could never contravene what is incumbent on us in our higher or corporate capacity, because the Lord under whom we act is the Head of the body.<a name=342:13></a> But yet it is here that godly

	<div class="paragraph">
		Everything we see and come in contact with has a relation to God and to men.<a name=354:8></a> It has a relation to man simply because he is in contact with it; and it necessarily has a relation to God because all is His.<a name=354:9></a> To be able to see each thing purely and simply as it is in relation to God is spirituality.<a name=354:10></a> To reach this there must not only be a getting clear of one's own relation to it - that is, as it affects or touches oneself, which I will call personal hindrance - but there are cases in which there may be hindrances to spirituality, even with a measure of self-renunciation and a measure of estimate of its relation to God.<a name=354:11></a> Correct knowledge, devotedness, godliness - any one of these, when made <i>paramount</i>, will so blind and engross the heart that the relation to oneself is not quite renounced; and if not, the relation it bears to God cannot be accepted, and thus there is not spirituality.<a name=354:12></a>

		Now it will be at once conceded that where there is personal feeling or selfishness, there cannot be spirituality; that is, when I look at anything as it relates to myself.<a name=355:1></a> And yet how often do we speak of and regard things and persons as they are in relation to ourselves!<a name=355:2></a> Surely christians would not make so many mistakes, and have so many different views about the same persons and things, if they were looked at and judged of in their relation to God, and not as they are in relation to oneself.<a name=355:3></a> Lot regarded the well watered plain of Sodom as the right place for him, because he saw it only in relation to himself.<a name=355:4></a> Barnabas maintained that Mark was the right man to accompany him in service, because he looked at him chiefly in relation to himself - he being his kinsman.<a name=355:5></a> The psalmist in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#73">Psalm  73</a>is nearly overwhelmed because he looks at all the disorganisation and consequences of sin on the earth in relation to himself.<a name=355:6></a> He arrives at a very different judgment when, in the sanctuary, he sees the same things in their relation to God <i>only</i>.<a name=355:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Many are, like the psalmist, greatly tried about things, simply because they are looking at them in relation to themselves.<a name=355:8></a> A person can be, as the psalmist was, very true and painstaking in forming an opinion, and yet, because he has himself so before his mind, he fails to see the state of things as they are in the mind of God.<a name=355:9></a> This is a very common hindrance to spirituality; one's own feelings so unknowingly sway one, and they are so spontaneous and at hand, that unless the soul is so near the Lord as to be bowed before Him in the greatness of His presence, and thus compelled to set oneself aside, there can be no escape from imbibing and adopting a view of things in relation to oneself.<a name=355:10></a> It is thus that self or selfishness is a hindrance to spirituality; and though so constant and obtrusive, yet it is the one more easily corrected than other hindrances.<a name=355:11></a>

		The knowledge of the first great promise to man led to a sad misconception on the part of Eve, which doubtless led her to call her firstborn Cain.<a name=356:7></a> Knowledge of the word of God, be it ever so critical, leads, if used by the natural mind, to error and confusion.<a name=356:8></a> I require the mind of Christ as well as a true knowledge of the Scriptures in order to be spiritual or to follow the will of God.<a name=356:9></a> The natural man can grasp a sense in the words of Scripture, and yet be far from the drift of them, like the disciples answering our Lord, "Here are two swords", understanding His words about buying a sword in a literal sense.<a name=356:10></a> Here it is that scholarship fails so much, and is so wide of spirituality.<a name=356:11></a> You hardly ever find that a person who relies too much on criticism is really spiritual.<a name=356:12></a> It is a word that governs him and not the Spirit of God.<a name=356:13></a> Thus the Pharisees condemned the Lord for breaking the sabbath, and those of the circumcision urged that believers could not be saved unless they were circumcised.<a name=356:14></a> In every way "the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life".<a name=356:15></a> There is no more painful or profitless attempt at service than a mere critical exposition of the Scriptures, it is but as "sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal".<a name=356:16></a> Satan can have a verbal knowledge of the word, and of course he can help a man to what he knows himself.<a name=356:17></a> Balaam had a clear knowledge of the

		Next, one might be devoted, and yet not be spiritual.<a name=357:2></a> A devoted saint is very interesting unless he makes devotedness everything, and measures everyone by it; for thus he is directly or indirectly calling attention to his own doings, or pressing them on others.<a name=357:3></a> Devotedness is simply the expression of a heart devoted to the Lord, and which is in any and every way interested in Him to the neglect of oneself.<a name=357:4></a> Jonathan was devoted when he "stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle".<a name=357:5></a> Real devotedness to one worthy of it is very attractive; but when one becomes cumbered by it, as Martha was, or when one draws attention to it in any way, its bloom is gone.<a name=357:6></a> There cannot be spirituality without devotedness, but there can be devotedness without spirituality.<a name=357:7></a> Peter was truly devoted in heart; he had left all, and he reminded the Lord of it, which is a common occurrence with many devoted people.<a name=357:8></a> When there is only devotedness, however true it is, the interest and energy is chiefly shown in sacrifice.<a name=357:9></a> In doctrine and practice it is ever on the subjective side.<a name=357:10></a> Jonah when restored was devoted, but he had much to learn afterwards.<a name=357:11></a> Devotedness is more what I do to the Lord than what I acquire from Him.<a name=357:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Lastly, even a godly person might not be spiritual.<a name=357:13></a> One young in grace is often godly, has a just sense of the holiness of God, and stands in awe of Him, which is a true check on the flesh, and a work of the Spirit; but when godliness is the great aim, most valuable and exemplary as it is, it is not by itself spirituality.<a name=357:14></a>

		the mind of the Spirit of God hinders spirituality.<a name=358:1></a> "The things of God knows no one except the Spirit of God".<a name=358:2></a> It is evident, as I have stated, that when I regard anything in a merely natural light, I have wandered from the mind of the Spirit to my own mind.<a name=358:3></a> It is only when I am near the Lord that I am spiritual, and then my own mind, which is at the root of every hindrance, is set aside and silenced; and this is more easily exposed, and therefore corrected, when it is not connected with things which screen it, such as knowledge, devotion, or piety.<a name=358:4></a> As spirituality only lives and thrives near the Lord, the great mark of the spiritual man is that the presence of the Lord is necessary to him, and the proof of his spirituality is that he knows when he is near Him, and is very sensible of his lack when he is not.<a name=358:5></a> Hence, while the knowledge of the word is his great desire, it is that he may be better versed in the mind of the Lord, though he finds that it is only when near Him that the knowledge of it takes right shape in his soul.<a name=358:6></a> He knows that otherwise he would be like one who knows the theory of medicine, and yet is not able to adapt it to a given case, or like one well acquainted with mechanics as a science, but incapable from a lack of practical knowledge to use it aright.<a name=358:7></a> It is only the spiritual mind which can adapt and perceive what is the mind of the Spirit in any case, and thus be able to wield the word of God effectually therein.<a name=358:8></a> Hence a spiritual man can apply Scripture, and discover the mind of the Lord in figures and allegories, in a way which is quite foreign and incomprehensible to the man who has learned the Scriptures only as a science.<a name=358:9></a> The knowledge of the word in the most complete way, as we learn from the incident of the two disciples going to Emmaus (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24">Luke  24</a>) is not sufficient to lead to a spiritual course, until the Lord is known (verse 31).<a name=358:10></a> But then they are in the very line with Himself; they do not think it too late to go to Jerusalem; and when they get there, while they are telling their tale, He stands in the midst of them.<a name=358:11></a> We find, as a rule, that when God communicates His

		THE CLOSING TESTIMONY
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To bear in mind and set forth to the last the character and features of the testimony which has been committed to God's servants has been a matter of deep interest at all times.<a name=360:1></a> Moses sets it forth in a song in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#32">Deuteronomy  32</a>.<a name=360:2></a> Joshua set up a great stone, and said.<a name=360:3></a> "This stone shall be a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the Lord, which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest ye deny your God", <a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#24:27">Joshua  24:27</a>.<a name=360:4></a> The testimony would at all events be preserved in and by the great stone - typically our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=360:5></a> It was the chief burden of the prophets not only to arouse and awaken the people to the testimony, but also to announce the true and full expression of it hereafter, by Him to whom we turn in the very close of the assembly's history here, as the "faithful and true witness".<a name=360:6></a> The testimony of the Lord, according to His mind, must be of paramount interest to those who at every time follow Him and love His name.<a name=360:7></a> Thus we find Paul, Peter, John, Jude and James, dwelling on the testimony to the very end, instructing the saints how to act in the circumstances and condition of things that will be at the end.<a name=360:8></a> Surely it becomes us, and it will instruct and encourage us, to trace briefly the leading subjects which engage our attention with regard to the testimony, in order that we may be better able to understand the will of our Lord for us in a day like this.<a name=360:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul, in <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#3">2 Timothy  3</a>, specially instructs the servant in the nature of the difficult days which are to come, and how the servant is to act in such a time.<a name=360:10></a> Christendom - or the professing church, if we compare <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#3">2 Timothy  3</a>with Romans 1 - is not only as corrupt as heathendom; but the corruption of the former is more relative, that is, in relation to man, while in the latter it is more selfish, or self-gratification.<a name=360:11></a> There is a deeper vein of malice in christendom, though not the same immorality as in

		heathendom.<a name=361:1></a> Now in this time, and when things are in this state, "having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof", there would be leaders after the type of Jannes and Jambres, secretly canvassing for followers, easily duped, laden with sins, led away with divers lusts; all this to resist the truth.<a name=361:2></a> Then three things are distinctly presented, the moral state of the mass, the character of the leaders, and that of their followers.<a name=361:3></a> The success of the leaders for the moment would be in proportion as they were able to deceive and to resist the truth.<a name=361:4></a> Now the true witness in such a day would, as Timothy is exhorted, be marked by two things; first, the persistent continuance in the things which he had learned from Paul, and secondly, the knowledge of the Scriptures - in a word, Paul's doctrine or teaching, and all that God had inspired, without any limit; because "all scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works".<a name=361:5></a> A man thus furnished is the one fit and prepared to uphold the testimony in the closing hour.<a name=361:6></a>

		Now, having been instructed in the knowledge he is to possess, we turn to the manner in which he is to act.<a name=361:7></a> (See <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#4:1">2 Timothy  4:1</a> - 5).<a name=361:8></a> It is not simply the rapture of the saints he is to have before his mind, but the appearing of the Lord.<a name=361:9></a> He is to be patient and labour, and not to be discouraged by the general disposition to turn away their ears from the truth, but he is to go on; and in order to make full proof of his ministry, he is, in addition to all his labours, to do the work of an evangelist.<a name=361:10></a> The maintenance of the truth as it had been delivered was his main duty, but he must not forget the unconverted, while he sought with persevering zeal to controvert the errors of the hour.<a name=361:11></a> It is, I believe, a weakness in the servant which we may often notice, to make preaching to the unconverted his chief service and interest; it is evident that it is not the line of duty prescribed and

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is one thing more that the servant must be prepared for in order to be true to the testimony to the close; and that is, he is not to be discouraged or disappointed even if all the saints desert him at a crisis, because of fear and pressure from the enemy.<a name=362:5></a> The Lord will stand with him, and when things are apparently most against him, there will be an opportunity for proclaiming the testimony of the Lord.<a name=362:6></a> The witness thinks of everything and everyone with reference to the Lord.<a name=362:7></a> Therefore he is often a reprover and judicial, as well as a minister of grace, for we have seen that he must do the work of an evangelist.<a name=362:8></a> He must not cease to offer grace to the unconverted, though severe and unyielding to the professor of the truth.<a name=362:9></a>

		WHAT RESTRICTS THE HOLY SPIRIT'S ACTION IN THIS DAY?
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		No one could read John's gospel and the Acts of the Apostles without being convinced that the Holy Spirit occupies an entirely new place on the earth, and performs new and unknown services in the saints.<a name=365:7></a> The christian era is pre-eminently distinguished by the fact that the Holy Spirit has come down from heaven, and that His coming was to confer new and great benefits on every believer.<a name=365:8></a> These are recounted and declared in John's gospel and in the Acts of the Apostles.<a name=365:9></a> Each believer receives the Holy Spirit, not only the company gathered at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost, but Peter presents this gift as the characteristic complement of divine grace.<a name=365:10></a> "Repent, and be baptised, each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for remission of sins, and ye will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:38">Acts  2:38</a>.<a name=365:11></a> The reception of the Holy Spirit was to crown the blessing of grace; grace would not be completed without the individual possessing the Holy Spirit; nay, possessing Him was the only finish - the end to conversion.<a name=365:12></a> Hence when the apostles heard of the conversions in Samaria, two of

		their number were sent there for the express purpose of imparting to them the Holy Spirit.<a name=366:1></a> Do we in this day feel like the apostles in that day when we hear of conversions - the need of the additional service, or the only finish to grace, even the reception of the Holy Spirit?<a name=366:2></a> We learn from the fact of the Holy Spirit falling on the gentiles in the house of Cornelius, that they were owned of God as in the same blessing as the Jewish converts at Jerusalem.<a name=366:3></a> Peter, in vindicating himself to his brethren, does not urge that the gentiles were converted, but that they had "received the Holy Spirit, as <i>we</i> also did".<a name=366:4></a> In like manner we find Paul asking the converts at Ephesus, "Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed?<a name=366:5></a>" It is plain that conversion was not considered sufficient, or the whole of grace, but that the receiving of the Holy Spirit was the only true and proper finish or end of the grace of God to the believer, and that until this gift was received, he must be ignorant of his new and divine relationship, and therefore powerless to act in the life and walk of Christ.<a name=366:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We must see and own the great place which the Holy Spirit occupies now on the earth, and how every believer is entitled to possess Him, before our new identity can be known, or true christian practice can be performed.<a name=366:7></a> In a word, we are premature in asking believers to practise until they are in possession of the Holy Spirit.<a name=366:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle founds all his arguments in Galatians on the fact that they had received the Holy Spirit.<a name=366:9></a> Everywhere we turn we find that the possession of the Holy Spirit was the simple and necessary proof and assurance of being in a christian state.<a name=366:10></a> In this day there are, through mercy, many converted, but could we say that even the majority of them had received the Holy Spirit?<a name=366:11></a> Or has there been care and attention to ascertain the fact, whether they have received the Holy Spirit since they believed?<a name=366:12></a> We cannot regard the reception of the Holy Spirit as a small or ordinary thing, or to be confounded with conversion - great and blessed as that is - by the

		power of the Holy Spirit in the soul.<a name=367:1></a> What language could describe the effects produced by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, both with oneself individually, or with regard to others?<a name=367:2></a> First, <a href="../bible/John.htm#4:14">John  4:14</a>: "Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life".<a name=367:3></a> Gifts of any measure from without could in no way contribute to man's full happiness like the gift here spoken of; so great is it that never before nor again will he be favoured to the same extent by the blessed God.<a name=367:4></a> Were the nature and measure of this gift more seen and appreciated, there would be unceasing seeking to secure it, and unbounded joy in possessing it.<a name=367:5></a> But it is not only that this gift imparts inexhaustible resources to the believer, but it enables him, enriched beyond measure himself, to contribute to the blessing of others.<a name=367:6></a> "Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water", <a href="../bible/John.htm#7:38">John  7:38</a>.<a name=367:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, we find this great gift specified and defined in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:26">John  14:26</a>, where the service and benefit to the believer for himself is set forth; and in chapter 15: 26, we find that by Him the testimony here was to be maintained.<a name=367:8></a> In the Acts we have abundant testimony of the effect and virtues of this gift.<a name=367:9></a> The lame man who sat and begged at the beautiful gate of the temple, when healed by the name of Jesus, characteristically set forth the personal and ostensible effect of the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=367:10></a> He was "walking, and leaping, and praising God"; while his outward circumstances were not in the least altered, he was conscious in himself of the power of God, and this so delighted him that he was exclusively occupied with God's great favour to him.<a name=367:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now when we compare this with the present time and the experience of believers, we are forced to the conclusion that there are some distinct causes for the present restricted action of the Holy Spirit.<a name=367:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first cause, in my judgment, is ignorance - ignorance of the grace of our God, and that the Holy

		Spirit has been sent down to crown in the soul the efficacy of the work of Christ.<a name=368:1></a> If many of the servants of God were not ignorant of this great truth, surely they would more earnestly and continually press it on their hearers.<a name=368:2></a> The mass are very much like the Ephesians, who had not heard whether there were any Holy Spirit.<a name=368:3></a> Doubtless the mere doctrine is admitted, but the value and importance of possessing the Holy Spirit is not seen or comprehended.<a name=368:4></a> Now if one of the plainest of revealed truths can be overlooked, and not learned or seen in the word of God, it is obvious that the Spirit must be restricted in His action.<a name=368:5></a> The Spirit Himself is the power by which we understand the word which reveals His service.<a name=368:6></a> Hence when the saints fail to see the marked place which He holds in the New Testament, there is surely evidence of the spiritually dull and inaccurate way in which the Scriptures are read, and the little real acceptance there is of the plainest statements of the word of God.<a name=368:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have heard of animals which cannot see in the sun.<a name=368:8></a> In like manner many believers now have some light; but the power of all light residing here on earth they do not own; and as they do not honour the Lord, they are not honoured of Him.<a name=368:9></a> For what can be done for those who cannot see the meaning of the plainest scriptures?<a name=368:10></a> They in a way resist the Holy Spirit; and hence, like Israel, they are left very much to their own devices, without the aid or comfort of the Holy Spirit.<a name=368:11></a> Thus He is restricted in His action, though He waits to be gracious, and to not a few He ministers the grace of Christ, though they are ignorant of the manner in which they are served.<a name=368:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next to ignorance is what I may call an insensibility to this great truth.<a name=368:13></a> While it is formally accepted, there seems little or no consciousness of the magnitude of it.<a name=368:14></a> They can even adopt the order and rule of the Spirit of God, and yet all the time the heart is far from the sense of His presence and power.<a name=368:15></a> If the ignorant are so

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But there is yet another cause for the restricted action of the Holy Spirit in this day, and possibly the most grievous to the Spirit of God.<a name=369:9></a> It is unbelief.<a name=369:10></a> Several would affirm in the most confident way that they possess the Holy Spirit, that they are the greatest living wonders ever seen on this earth - temples of the Holy Spirit, that in so small and feeble a tenement as the human body there dwells and is enjoyed the greatest gift and state God ever conferred on man.<a name=369:11></a> Yet many, who would unhesitatingly declare that they are thus favoured, have so little faith in the reality of the power of God that they condescend to ways and means of doing the Lord's work, not to speak of their own, as if they were as other men, who never heard or believed that the Holy Spirit has come down from heaven, not only to be here, but to be in the believer.<a name=369:12></a> If I really believe that the Holy Spirit was here, that not only was all the power of God invisibly beside me, but He also dwelling in me, how could I dare or venture to do anything but at His

		That which occurred at the very beginning, between only two brothers, depicts the two lines which have coursed the earth from that day to this.<a name=371:7></a> It is not only that all who live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution, but the more divinely anyone adheres to the call of God, the more will he at the same time suffer, not only from the ignorant unbeliever, but from those who hold the truth avowedly, but unspiritually.<a name=371:8></a> It is a great help to the man of God to see that his greatest opponent and enemy is the brother who dippeth in the same dish with him, and with whom he has gone in company to the house of the Lord, if he be not really and truly in the place he has taken.<a name=371:9></a> It was God's accepting Abel's offering which awoke all the diabolical rage of Cain.<a name=371:10></a> And so it has been ever since; the favour of God in communicating His mind to the faithful has evoked the deadliest opposition from those who considered themselves entitled to it.<a name=371:11></a> It was the grace and goodness of our Lord on the earth which woke up the bitter, unrelenting hate of the great professors of the hour.<a name=371:12></a> It was not the cavillers or indifferent who were His chief enemies, but those who assumed to be leaders and guides of God's people on earth.<a name=371:13></a> To any reflecting mind it must be clear that there is a deeper opposition from those who accept

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now having seen, in some measure, the quarter from which the deadliest opposition will come, let us examine what would be the only true course for the man of God with regard to those from whom he will suffer most.<a name=372:5></a> His course will, I apprehend, be marked by a twofold action; the first, more of a negative character - no temporising; the other aggressive.<a name=372:6></a> By no temporising I mean no concession of any principle, in theory or in practice.<a name=372:7></a> Abel best considered for Cain when he kept fully and distinctly before his mind that which was due from a sinner to God.<a name=372:8></a> True, Abel did not live to practise the aggressive part, but God followed it up, and Cain was a marked man on the earth.<a name=372:9></a> Thus with Moses; he not only resisted the envy of his brother and sister, but Aaron has to entreat of him that the judgment of God might be removed from Miriam.<a name=372:10></a> (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#12">Numbers  12</a>.<a name=372:11></a>) In like manner Moses does not yield at all to Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, but he is aggressive, he seeks judgment from God upon their heads.<a name=372:12></a> It was in this spirit, too, that he charged the sons of Levi, when he "stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the Lord's side?<a name=372:13></a> let him come unto me.<a name=372:14></a> And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.<a name=372:15></a> And he said unto them.<a name=372:16></a>.<a name=372:17></a>.<a name=372:18></a> Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and

		Thus our blessed Lord, the true Israelite, not only did not in any way temporise with the religious leaders of the people, but He eventually denounced and exposed them as blind guides, etc.<a name=373:2></a> We see the same with the apostle Paul; he was not content with the most distinct line with regard to them, but while he consigned Hymenaeus and Philetus to the judgment of God, he openly warns of Alexander, and looks to God to reward him according to his works.<a name=373:3></a>

		The instruction I gather from all these examples is that a time may come when one is not to think so much of the congregation as of God.<a name=373:4></a> The truth and glory of Christ must be considered far more than the feelings of any; nay, the best way to ensure the true and solid blessing of every believer is by the most decided maintenance of the truth in its integrity.<a name=373:5></a> "Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.<a name=373:6></a> By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:1">1 John  5:1</a>, 2.<a name=373:7></a> It is the man who gives the uncertain sound who does the real mischief.<a name=373:8></a> "But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and take any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand", <a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#33:6">Ezekiel  33:6</a>.<a name=373:9></a>
