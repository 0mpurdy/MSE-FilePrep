		The apostle is contrasting the christian position with that of being under law.<a name=1:1></a> The law was given in connection with glory; we read that the children of Israel could not look at the face of Moses, because his face shone, "for the glory of his countenance;" but <i>this</i> glory is done away, because of "the glory that excelleth".<a name=1:2></a> <i>Now</i> there is a ministration of righteousness <i>from</i> the glory.<a name=1:3></a> This is brought in to correct the Corinthians, who were trusting in their own wisdom.<a name=1:4></a> Presenting Christ is the only true way of restoration, whatever the character of the departure may be.<a name=1:5></a> The great point here is that the flesh is displaced in the form in which it had worked in the Corinthians, they were boasting in their own wisdom.<a name=1:6></a> God's way of correcting is not merely to point out the error; that is man's way: the way of His grace is to set forth the right way, and then you see where you are wrong.<a name=1:7></a> If you learn how you yourself are displaced, you will never forget it - the true correction is that self is disallowed, and in abeyance.<a name=1:8></a> If you try to correct yourself, you are still there.<a name=1:9></a> There is no place for flesh in the glory of God.<a name=1:10></a> In verse 18 we read, "But we all .<a name=1:11></a>.<a name=1:12></a>.<a name=1:13></a> beholding .<a name=1:14></a>.<a name=1:15></a>.<a name=1:16></a> the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord;" but you will never really understand this until you <i>try</i> it, and so prove the truth of it.<a name=1:17></a> To illustrate what I mean, if a man suffers from headache, and is told that electricity would cure it, he cannot know the good of it unless he tries it.<a name=1:18></a> Beholding the glory of the Lord, you have come to a spot where flesh cannot be, for self is in abeyance.<a name=1:19></a> As the queen of Sheba was in the presence of Solomon,

		The two disciples going to Emmaus heard the Lord's exposition of the word, and their hearts burned within them, but they were not changed in their course till they knew Him, and then they rose up and went to Jerusalem.<a name=2:11></a> His interests were paramount to them, they were now so under His control that they went the same road that He went.<a name=2:12></a> If we were in the holiest, the presence of the Lord, how clear our judgment would be as to everything for Him; <i>there</i> you see things as they relate to <i>His</i> interests, and <i>then</i> you get guidance.<a name=2:13></a> The great thing is to behold the glory of the Lord.<a name=2:14></a> The nearer the prodigal got to the father, the better off he was; all fear was gone when he was in his house.<a name=2:15></a> You will be so entranced with the things there that, like the queen of Sheba, there will be no more spirit in you, you yourself will be in abeyance.<a name=2:16></a>

		Any reader can see in this scripture that there are two aspects of our Lord perfectly distinct the one from the other: the Jonah aspect, and the Solomon aspect.<a name=5:1></a> The Lord Jesus Christ is greater than either.<a name=5:2></a> Jonah was three days and three nights in the whale's belly - that sets forth the death of Christ; while Solomon sets forth His glory - He was the "greater than Solomon".<a name=5:3></a> We have to learn Christ in both these aspects.<a name=5:4></a> If you have not learnt Him in the first, you cannot learn Him in the second.<a name=5:5></a> I press that you must learn the first completely before you can reach the second.<a name=5:6></a> Christ once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, to bring us to God.<a name=5:7></a> The judgment of God on man must be first removed in judgment.<a name=5:8></a> Many are in comparative darkness, because they do not see that the man under judgment has been terminated judicially in the cross for the believer.<a name=5:9></a> God never revives that man.<a name=5:10></a> That which was under judgment has been removed in judgment.<a name=5:11></a> The resurrection of Christ is not merely a receipt that your sins are atoned for, but that a Man after a new order has come up out of death, no more according to the flesh, so that for the believer, not only is the mortgage on the house paid off (speaking figuratively), but every stone of the house has come down, and a new one is built on the same spot, but with none of the old material.<a name=5:12></a> "We have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens", <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:1">2 Corinthians  5:1</a>.<a name=5:13></a> Many are trying to beautify the old.<a name=5:14></a> It is in Christ's resurrection that the clearance was effected, "Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification", <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#4:25">Romans  4:25</a>.<a name=5:15></a> We are no

		The Colossians were a nice company.<a name=57:5></a> The apostle could speak of their faith and love, and he prays for them on account of the hope which was laid up for them in heaven (chapter 1: 4, 5); yet they did not know the mystery.<a name=57:6></a> It is very important to understand how far you may go without knowing the mystery.<a name=57:7></a> The great point in the mystery brought out in this epistle is that Christ is the Head.<a name=57:8></a> It is not that they had never heard of the mystery but they did not have it in power.<a name=57:9></a> Therefore the second chapter opens with, "I would have you know what combat I have for you".<a name=57:10></a> A combat supposes a great opposition.<a name=57:11></a> Even the apostle was in prison.<a name=57:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Remember the Colossians were in what we would call a nice state.<a name=57:13></a> The apostle could rejoice in beholding their order and the steadfastness of their faith in Christ (chapter 2: 5).<a name=57:14></a> But they did not know the mystery and it was important for them to know it because it was the great and only preservative from the snare to which they were exposed at the time, and with which christendom has been caught.<a name=57:15></a> That snare is that by man's mind and religiousness you could .<a name=57:16></a>help on the service of Christ by what is called tradition - the rudiments of the world - and philosophy, or, in theological language, ritualism and rationalism.<a name=57:17></a> One is making man's body and the other making man's mind contribute to Christ's service.<a name=57:18></a> That was the impending danger at this time and I need not say that it is what has overrun christendom.<a name=57:19></a> No one would be appointed a minister of the gospel in christendom if he

	<div class="paragraph">
		The snare was different from that at Corinth or among the Galatians, because the idea was to make man's mind contribute as it were to Christ and to His service.<a name=58:2></a> The Corinthians were full of their own mind but it was all for themselves, not for Christ's service, and the Galatians were full of law but it was to correct themselves, not to contribute to the service of Christ.<a name=58:3></a> But everyone knows what is rampant now in christendom, ritualism on the one hand and rationalism on the other.<a name=58:4></a> The one has to do with religiousness and the other with man's mind.<a name=58:5></a> Now nothing can save you from ritualism or rationalism but the knowledge of the Head.<a name=58:6></a> Many may think they are safe from this influence but it is uncommonly subtle, and a person may very easily be taken with the idea that by certain religious attitudes, or gestures, or some bodily effort, he can help on the work of Christ; on the contrary, he will hinder it.<a name=58:7></a>

		Our subject still is, "the Holy Spirit", and we now come to the point of how we arrive at the conscious knowledge of the truth of union with Christ, and the effects of this favour.<a name=136:1></a> Every believer is united to Christ as having the Spirit, but everyone is not in the realisation of union.<a name=136:2></a> These Ephesian believers had gone on to a good degree; and now, in this chapter, the apostle prays for them to the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, for the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him, that they might know these three things: (1) the hope of God's calling; (2) the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints; (3) the exceeding greatness of His power to us-ward, etc.<a name=136:3></a> If we turn to the type in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24">Genesis  24</a>it will help us to see how the knowledge of these things is arrived at.<a name=136:4></a> There are seven points in Rebekah's case that illustrate for us the road we must travel to reach the true Isaac - Christ.<a name=136:5></a> Isaac is a type of the heavenly Man - Christ.<a name=136:6></a> He was not to leave the land of Canaan - figure of heavenly places.<a name=136:7></a> But Abraham's servant is sworn to bring a bride of his own kindred from the distant land - Mesopotamia - for his master's son; and one who would be in every way suitable to him and for him.<a name=136:8></a> There must be no incongruity between them.<a name=136:9></a> That is the first point.<a name=136:10></a> In type it is the Father's thought to have a bride for His Son, and the Holy Spirit is the Servant to lead and conduct the bride to Christ.<a name=136:11></a> All this corresponds beautifully with <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>.<a name=136:12></a> The second point (verses 13 - 19, etc.<a name=136:13></a>) is that not only is Rebekah the right person, but her grace commanded her; she not only gives the servant a drink as requested, but proffers drink for the camels also.<a name=136:14></a> She goes in grace beyond

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, by remaining satisfied with knowing relief only, like the nine lepers (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#17">Luke  17</a>), instead of coming to Himself, as one of them did, who, when he was relieved, turned back, and fell down at Jesus' feet, giving Him thanks, and with a loud voice glorified God.<a name=150:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Secondly, from not having learnt the terrible nature of the distance between God and themselves.<a name=150:3></a> This must be learnt, and a deep, solemn moment it is when the soul is brought to see that the only way out of death is by appropriating the death of Christ.<a name=150:4></a> Many are like the large company at Pi-hahiroth; they are clear of judgment but have not, walked through the Red Sea.<a name=150:5></a> Then, thirdly though they know Christ as having died, yet they do not know Christ risen.<a name=150:6></a> The simple answer to faith in Christ risen is that you receive the Spirit.<a name=150:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next step is to <i>follow the Lord:</i> "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they <i>follow me".<a name=150:8></a></i> Many are truly converted who do not follow Him, for if they followed Him, they would come to Himself outside of everything here.<a name=150:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord had come into the Jewish fold, but instead of remaining there He leads His sheep out of it.<a name=150:10></a> The fold sets forth the religious ordinances in the world (what we sometimes call 'system').<a name=150:11></a> This detains many, and what they have to learn is to follow the Lord.<a name=150:12></a> When we believe His grace we follow Him, and he that follows Him does not walk in darkness, but has the light of life.<a name=150:13></a>

		On a former occasion I pressed that the very first action of the Holy Spirit in the soul is to assure you of God's love to you, and then you are not thinking about yourself or your own state, but of Him; though no doubt you will be greatly exercised as to how you are answering to the love.<a name=190:12></a> Now you know you have a bond with Christ, you are linked with Him, and a new interest altogether is awakened in you; it is with Him you are occupied.<a name=190:13></a> He is now before you, and you know that He loves you.<a name=190:14></a>

		If that is all you are thinking of, you lose sight of the wonderful nature of the grace that has met you.<a name=192:1></a> The nature of that grace is that it enables you to come out a man altogether after a new stamp, not what men would call a better man, but a <i>man for God;</i> you <i>were</i> for yourself in one form or another, but now you are for God, and God is glorified in you as in the case of the palsied man.<a name=192:2></a>

		I have been endeavouring in these preachings to set forth the different ways in which souls are hindered from embracing a full gospel.<a name=193:1></a> I will just recapitulate the different points.<a name=193:2></a> First, souls are hindered by remaining satisfied with knowing relief only; and we saw that relief can be known without coming to Himself.<a name=193:3></a> I illustrated this by the case of the ten lepers in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#17">Luke  17</a>.<a name=193:4></a> All were relieved, but only one came to Himself; only one, when he was relieved, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God, and fell down on his face at Jesus' feet, giving Him thanks.<a name=193:5></a> And again in the case of the widow of Sarepta, we saw that she not only had relief from the famine, but her son was raised from the dead.<a name=193:6></a> There was life out of death, and that is really what the soul is brought to when it apprehends Christ risen.<a name=193:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My second subject was that persons may have received the grace of God without having yet learned the terrible nature of the distance between God and themselves, and that they have to learn it like Jonah when he was "three days and three nights in the whale's belly", or like Saul of Tarsus, when, after being struck to the earth by the light from heaven, he was "three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink", learning that there was a way out of death through Christ's death - a deeply solemn moment.<a name=193:8></a> That is where a great many are really hindered, because they have never gone the road.<a name=193:9></a> As has been said, there was a large company at Pi-hahiroth, safe from the judgment of God, but not delivered from the enemy.<a name=193:10></a> And why?<a name=193:11></a> Because they had not passed through the waters of death.<a name=193:12></a> They had not yet walked through the Red Sea.<a name=193:13></a> What is walking through the Red Sea for

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My third subject was that many know Christ as having died who do not know Him as risen, and that the simple answer to faith in Christ risen is that you receive the Holy Spirit; you get the power from the glorified Saviour, and the first expression of the power is demonstrated in your weakest point.<a name=194:5></a> This we saw illustrated by the palsied man in <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#2">Mark  2</a>.<a name=194:6></a> He carried that whereon he lay, he carried his bed.<a name=194:7></a> And so it will be with you; whatever it was that governed you in nature, if you have received the Holy Spirit it does not govern you now.<a name=194:8></a> In the power of Christ you are under another government.<a name=194:9></a> This we saw typified, too, in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#3">Acts  3</a>, when the man who had been lame was seen walking and leaping and praising God, and Peter says, "And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all".<a name=194:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This evening I take up what is also deeply important, and what in one sense is more interesting, and that is - that the next step is following the Lord.<a name=194:11></a> As the Lord Himself says, "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me".<a name=194:12></a> Now there are a great many who are truly converted who are not following Him.<a name=194:13></a> To follow Him is to come to Himself outside everything here, as I will show you presently.<a name=194:14></a> But first I want to show you what is the mark of following Him.<a name=194:15></a> "When he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice".<a name=194:16></a> The Lord in this chapter is describing how He Himself had come into the Jewish fold, and all connected with law, and all that the law required, and to Him the porter opened.<a name=194:17></a> He met every requirement of God, and He came in, and after having

	<div class="paragraph">
		entered into the fold, instead of staying in the fold He went out of it, "and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out".<a name=195:1></a> A great many are detained here, detained by the religious things that are going on around, not by what you would call bad things, but religious things, instead of following Him out of it all; just as the nine lepers in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#17">Luke  17</a>, when they were cleansed, went to the religious ordinances instead of coming to the Lord.<a name=195:2></a> One came back to Him, and what marked him was that when he found that he was healed, he felt he <i>must</i> go to the One who had healed him; and that is the beginning of following Him.<a name=195:3></a> The others did not go morally wrong, but they went to religious ordinances, religious observances, and that is often considered a very great and a very good thing to do.<a name=195:4></a> But when you have a true apprehension of what His grace really is, you go to Himself, you follow Him, and the Lord says, "He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life", <a href="../bible/John.htm#8:12">John  8:12</a>.<a name=195:5></a>

		Now in chapter 9, in the case of the man who had been blind from his birth and whose eyes were opened, we have an example of one who has received light and who keeps up to the light.<a name=195:6></a> It is not merely that he has been a subject of grace, but he knows he has got light, and he insists upon what he knows; he keeps to it.<a name=195:7></a> It is an immense gain when any soul keeps to what he knows.<a name=195:8></a> I have no doubt that the man who walks up to what he knows will get more.<a name=195:9></a> "He that hath, to him shall be given", <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#4:25">Mark  4:25</a>.<a name=195:10></a> It is exemplified in this man.<a name=195:11></a> He not only gets his eyes opened, but he insists on the One who has opened them, and therefore he advances until he gets to Christ.<a name=195:12></a> He meets with opposition on all sides; no one will acknowledge him.<a name=195:13></a> It is not what are called wicked people that he has to do with, but with the best, with the <i>elite</i> of society, so to speak, and each in turn they question and refuse him.<a name=195:14></a> First his neighbours are interested about him.<a name=195:15></a> Your neighbour

		Next the man's parents are called, and they are afraid to own him.<a name=196:11></a> They say, "He is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself".<a name=196:12></a> Then the Jews - the whole nation are against him, and in the long run he is cast out; they will not have him.<a name=196:13></a> At the end of their contention with him he says, "If this man were not of God, he could do nothing".<a name=196:14></a> See how he is advancing towards Christ!<a name=196:15></a> He is following up the light that he has received.<a name=196:16></a> Though as yet dimly, he is following the One who gave him the light.<a name=196:17></a> His heart is set upon it; hence as soon as he was cast out he was in the solitude of light.<a name=196:18></a> I believe, beloved friends, I speak advisedly, that no soul is in the full sense of the blessedness of the place in which Christ sets him until he is in the solitude of light.<a name=196:19></a> By the light which he has received from Christ he is outside everything, outside the most approved and the most reputable among men, he is outside of it all.<a name=196:20></a> You may say it is a very solitary place.<a name=196:21></a> No doubt it is; but he is not long in solitude.<a name=196:22></a> "Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?<a name=196:23></a>" Now he has come to the Person; he is outside of everything of man, and

		I have gone over this man's history to show you what comes out in chapter 10, because chapter 10 literally explains to us the position which the one who has received light, and who has been brought into the presence of Christ, has.<a name=197:4></a> The great confusion in the minds of many christians in christendom is that they think there is a place in the fold, or the Jewish order of things, for the christian; as if there was room made in the fold for the christian.<a name=197:5></a> Nothing can be more contrary to the statement of Scripture and to christianity.<a name=197:6></a> The Lord came into the fold, no doubt, and if the fold was to be maintained, that was the time to keep the sheep there.<a name=197:7></a> But He expressly states in the opening of the chapter that He <i>leads them out</i>.<a name=197:8></a> "He that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.<a name=197:9></a> To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and <i>leadeth them out".<a name=197:10></a></i> Now this man who had been blind <i>is</i> out.<a name=197:11></a> You may say, he is cast out; yes, he <i>is</i> cast out; that was man's side of it; but it was really the Lord <i>putting forth</i> His own sheep, and he finds the Lord outside of it.<a name=197:12></a> He has come to the Lord, and the Lord has come to him.<a name=197:13></a> This chapter explains the true position of every one now who follows Christ.<a name=197:14></a> He went into the fold, and He calls His own sheep by name, and leads them out.<a name=197:15></a> I do not think that all His sheep have come out.<a name=197:16></a> I think a great many are clinging to some form or other of the Jewish order of things, religious systems and the like.<a name=197:17></a> Do you ask, But are they not converted?<a name=197:18></a> Yes, perhaps truly converted, but they have not followed the Lord.<a name=197:19></a> If you are set on following Him, nothing will satisfy your heart but to find Him.<a name=197:20></a> Look at a true heart in the woman of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.B.<a name=357:1></a>S.<a name=357:2></a> The first point to see, and what is so striking and a puzzle to many, is that John begins the announcement of the gospel with <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21">Numbers  21</a>.<a name=357:3></a> Why did he not begin with <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#12">Exodus  12</a>or 14, with the work that brought them out of Egypt as a redeemed people?<a name=357:4></a> Why does John begin here?<a name=357:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He begins here because it meets the state of souls.<a name=357:6></a> Many have known something of the grace of God; they have faith in what has been done for them, they believe in the work that has been wrought, but they have not the enjoyment of it; I do not say they have no joy, but they do not walk in the abiding enjoyment of it; they do not know what we get in chapter 4, "A well of water springing up into everlasting life .<a name=357:7></a>.<a name=357:8></a>.<a name=357:9></a> never thirst" - they have not come to that in the experience of their souls.<a name=357:10></a> What John brings in is our side.<a name=357:11></a> It is not so much God's side.<a name=357:12></a> Do you see what I mean?<a name=357:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.B.<a name=357:16></a>S.<a name=357:17></a> Yes; it is like the prodigal son, he was all right with his father, when his father was on his neck; there was peace, but there was not happiness yet, for he did not feel fit for his father.<a name=357:18></a> He said, "I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight".<a name=357:19></a> Have you not found persons who have peace with God, who yet have not happiness because they get very distressed about their own sinfulness.<a name=357:20></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I propose in these readings to take up the history of the work of the Spirit of God in the soul.<a name=358:4></a> The first thing is peace, there is nothing between God and the soul; that is peace.<a name=358:5></a> I see that everything that stood between me and God has been removed by the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ; the One who was there bore the judgment due to me and glorified God.<a name=358:6></a> That is figured in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#14">Exodus  14</a>, the Red Sea.<a name=358:7></a> We appropriate the death of Christ, enter into the truth of His death and resurrection, that is a great point.<a name=358:8></a> But look at Israel.<a name=358:9></a> They were thirty-nine years in the wilderness and they were never rightly set for Canaan until after they looked at the brazen serpent; <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21">Numbers  21</a>.<a name=358:10></a> Now John begins (chapter 3) with the brazen serpent, because he begins with <i>our</i> side, how we get into the enjoyment of the work.<a name=358:11></a> It is important to see the difference between peace and enjoyment.<a name=358:12></a> It is a great thing to get peace by the work of Christ, but it is a great thing to get the enjoyment of it.<a name=358:13></a> That is what the prodigal son wanted; he knew there was nothing between his father and himself when his father kissed him; but what troubled him was, he was not fit for his father's house.<a name=358:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we come to our subject for tonight.<a name=358:15></a> What is deliverance?<a name=358:16></a> Perhaps no point in a christian's history is of deeper importance than deliverance, for nine-tenths of believers, as far as my judgment goes, are occupied with truths which are beyond deliverance, and who yet do not know deliverance.<a name=358:17></a> But they cannot progress one inch until they have deliverance.<a name=358:18></a> You must travel the road marked out in Scripture to get it.<a name=358:19></a> Do you understand what deliverance is?<a name=358:20></a>

		J.B.<a name=359:1></a>S.<a name=359:2></a> No, that is peace.<a name=359:3></a> Many a one knows peace, who does not know deliverance; that is exactly the blunder; I know it myself, I have gone that road.<a name=359:4></a> When I saw Christ had borne my judgment, and all was gone from the holy eye of God for ever, I said it was beautiful, it was profound blessing; but when I looked at myself I was not a bit happy.<a name=359:5></a> The fact is, at that time I was trying to improve the flesh.<a name=359:6></a> For deliverance you must have more than justification, you must see that the old man is gone from <i>your</i> eye, as clearly as you see that it is gone from <i>God's</i> eye.<a name=359:7></a> It must be by the Spirit that you learn that; it is only by the Spirit that you can see it gone.<a name=359:8></a> Peace is, I see myself gone from the eye of God through Christ's work.<a name=359:9></a> What comes next?<a name=359:10></a> <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>and <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21">Numbers  21</a>you find you are unmendably bad; you become sick of yourself; then you cry, "Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?<a name=359:11></a> I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord" <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7:24">Romans  7:24</a>, 25.<a name=359:12></a> Then it is gone, not from God's eye only, but from your own eye; and that through the Spirit of God in you.<a name=359:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I trust, beloved friends, that you are looking to the Lord that you may understand this - that you are an entirely new order of being, a new creation.<a name=393:3></a> "Old things have passed away".<a name=393:4></a> I have dwelt long on this because many christians are trying to be according to God's people on the earth, the law written in their hearts.<a name=393:5></a> I say, No, His own are now associated with Him inside the veil.<a name=393:6></a> He has been rejected by the world, and no one can be owned of God on this earth who is not of Christ; and if you are of Christ you join Him in the place where He is.<a name=393:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		UNION WITH THE HEAD.
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You have seen that you are in Christ, sons of God, and that you are with Him, His brethren; now I come to Christ the Head and your union with Him, that you are of Him, which plainly is new creation, as Eve came from Adam; she was called Ishshah because she was taken out of Ish.<a name=393:8></a> This is the great mystery.<a name=393:9></a> Nothing that you can have, not your best quality as a man, can be joined to Christ, all must come <i>from</i> Him.<a name=393:10></a> I shall refer to the Head first, and then to union.<a name=393:11></a> Everyone derives from his head; your head directs your life and all your ways.<a name=393:12></a> Now Christ is the Head of the body.<a name=393:13></a> If Christ is your Head He directs and orders all for Himself.<a name=393:14></a> It is a marvellous grace that we should be conformed to the image of God's Son.<a name=393:15></a> I think it is very sad that the highest thought which God has about us, and that which His heart is set on, is that which is least known by christians; for I know no truth that is so little realised as union with Christ.<a name=393:16></a> If I look at the type I find that God brought Eve to
	</div>

		<a name=394>[Page 394]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Adam, and it is similarly true now that each one of us is being conducted by the Spirit to Christ where He is.<a name=394:1></a> But then you must learn the Head first, that you derive from Him; and when you know union, which is the climax, you know that nothing can be united to Him but that which is of Him.<a name=394:2></a> If you are united to Him you partake of His mind and of His power.<a name=394:3></a> It must surely be most attractive to your heart, that when you know union with Christ you will be in consonance with His mind, and He will give you of His own power to do His pleasure.<a name=394:4></a> "The heart of her husband confideth in her" (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#31:11">Proverbs  31:11</a>), would be enjoyed by you.<a name=394:5></a> The great impression I desire to lay on your heart is that you are of Him - a new creation; and the higher you go the more it is established.<a name=394:6></a> Nothing can be more wonderful than the position into which you are brought; all is of Him - His tastes, His interests, everything becomes yours.<a name=394:7></a> The unmistakable mark of a man who knows union is that he has a new set of interests, Christ's interests.<a name=394:8></a> He may and should be attentive to his daily business, but Christ's interests are paramount with him.<a name=394:9></a> One may be doing little as to active service, but the first thought and purpose of the heart will be Christ's interests.<a name=394:10></a> But I only refer now to union with Christ in order to establish that we are a new creation.<a name=394:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will recall briefly the line I have gone over, in order that each one here may have it freshly before his mind, and thus be able to ponder it before the Lord.<a name=394:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first point is reconciliation.<a name=394:13></a> God has removed from His own eye in the cross all that was contrary to Him; man in the flesh is gone, and He has before Him the Man of His pleasure, and according to that Man He accepts you.<a name=394:14></a> If you believe that He who died has been raised from the dead, you are accepted in righteousness, and the testimony to you is that the Holy Spirit sheds abroad in your heart the love of

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=395>[Page 395]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God.<a name=395:1></a> Therefore we also joy in God through "our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom now we have received the reconciliation".<a name=395:2></a> That is the gospel.<a name=395:3></a> That is a wonderful position, the new position.<a name=395:4></a> Man in the flesh has gone from God's eye, and He has received you on the ground of the Man who has done all His pleasure.<a name=395:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Consequent on this the Holy Spirit has been given to you, and He assures your heart of the love of God.<a name=395:6></a> Now the same Holy Spirit who has done this makes you "free from the law of sin and of death" in the life of Christ: "the law of the Spirit of life <i>in Christ Jesus</i> has set me free" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:2">Romans  8:2</a>).<a name=395:7></a> It is not only that you know the heart of God towards you, as the prodigal knew that his father loved him when he kissed him; but you know that you are in Christ, you are led by the Spirit, you are the sons of God, you not only know your acceptance, but you can fully enjoy it, because you are in the Spirit.<a name=395:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next, you know you are the brethren of Christ, and you are associated with Him; you are brought from your own circumstances of trial individually into company with Him, into that bright scene where He is in the holiest of all, a great Priest over the house of God.<a name=395:9></a> You know the fulness of your approach to God, and there you learn the deepest wonders of divine grace, and that you have access to the Father.<a name=395:10></a> Hence the assembly is the place of blessing, because there Christ's presence is known, and there His mind is communicated, and as you know Him there you come forth as the royal priesthood to describe Him here.<a name=395:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One word more.<a name=395:12></a> The more you learn that Christ is your Head, and also that you are united to Him, the more effective you will be in the assembly; and the more the greatness of the place opens out to you, and the blessedness of His presence, the more will you be for Him here upon the earth, because you understand Him better.<a name=395:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		THE FORMATION.
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a new building.<a name=397:6></a> Bear in mind that christianity is altogether new.<a name=397:7></a> In christendom the thought in building a church is that it should resemble the Jewish temple.<a name=397:8></a> The formation of the spiritual house is that every believer, everyone who has "tasted that the Lord is good", comes to the living Stone: "to whom coming, a living stone".<a name=397:9></a> The step is to come to Him.<a name=397:10></a> He is risen from the dead, and there is no way of coming to Him but by the Spirit of God.<a name=397:11></a> You come to Him risen.<a name=397:12></a> If you want it illustrated, you get a pattern of it in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#14">Matthew  14</a>, where Peter walks on the water to go to Jesus.<a name=397:13></a> That is as true now morally as it was then literally.<a name=397:14></a> In order to reach Him you must go to the other side of death.<a name=397:15></a> It is very easy to come into a room to a meeting, but that is not coming to the Lord, that is not coming to the living Stone; you have to come to Him, and you could not come to Him but by the Spirit of God.<a name=397:16></a> You ask, What precedes it in the history of a soul?<a name=397:17></a> It is that you hear His voice and follow Him.<a name=397:18></a> You may say, How can I get to Him?<a name=397:19></a> You begin by following Him, and thus you

		<a name=398>[Page 398]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		leave everything that is not of Him.<a name=398:1></a> In following Him you break from all religious systems.<a name=398:2></a> He had entered the fold, and now "He calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#10:3">John  10:3</a>), and He adds, "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me" (verse 27).<a name=398:3></a> Peter literally left the ship to follow Him.<a name=398:4></a> You see the Lord at the other side of death, and you cannot cross over but by the Spirit of God.<a name=398:5></a> You may say.<a name=398:6></a> I am following Him.<a name=398:7></a> If you are, you follow Him outside all that is of man, of religious man.<a name=398:8></a> Practically you will be like the man who was blind in <a href="../bible/John.htm#9:35">John  9:35</a> - 38, he is eventually outside of everything religious, in the solitude of light, a wonderful place!<a name=398:9></a> outside of everything recognised among men as religious according to the law of God; then the Lord meets him, and says to him, "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?<a name=398:10></a>" Now he has come to the living Stone; he said, "I believe, Lord: and he did him homage".<a name=398:11></a> This is the step in coming to the living Stone.<a name=398:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One remark more before I pass from this section.<a name=398:13></a> In coming to the Lord, in following Him, you will be conscious of your infirmities, not of your sins; they are purged, as we read in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:3">Hebrews  1:3</a>, "having made by himself the purification of sins", etc.<a name=398:14></a> I would explain it as one who has travelled the road; you will be conscious of your infirmity, like Peter when he began to sink.<a name=398:15></a> He felt his inability to encounter the winds and the waves; and "he cried out, saying, Lord, save me.<a name=398:16></a> And .<a name=398:17></a>.<a name=398:18></a>.<a name=398:19></a> Jesus stretched out his hand and caught hold of him".<a name=398:20></a> He did not alter things here, but He brought him to His own side.<a name=398:21></a> Now that illustrates His priestly service; He knows your pressure, and He brings you out of the pressure to Himself where there is none.<a name=398:22></a> Thus you learn Christ's sympathy, One who has passed through the heavens, a great Priest, the Son of God.<a name=398:23></a> He not only draws you unto His own side, but eventually He conducts you into the company which surrounds Him; you are not merely relieved of

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=399>[Page 399]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		your pressure, but you have boldness to enter the holiest, where He is a great Priest over the house of God.<a name=399:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I trust you now understand the formation of the house.<a name=399:2></a> When you are in, and have found your place, you learn next the nature of the place.<a name=399:3></a> No one has conscious knowledge of anything into which he has not been brought experimentally.<a name=399:4></a> The exposition of Scripture does not give it to you; it sets it before you, and as your heart is exercised you are brought into it by the Spirit, and it becomes a part of yourself; it is then the engrafted word.<a name=399:5></a>

		THE LORD'S PLACE IN THE ASSEMBLY.
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		His place there will give an idea of its divine magnificence.<a name=399:6></a> You will bear in mind that I am speaking of the assembly as it is His building.<a name=399:7></a> The foundation is Jesus Christ; He is the living Stone, He is the Builder, and also He is Lord - there all things are by Him; and He is Son over God's house.<a name=399:8></a> I am pointing out His place in the spiritual house; He is also a great Priest over the house of God, He maintains His own in all the blessedness of His own nearness in the presence of God, in the holiest of all.<a name=399:9></a> It is great grace to apprehend His place in the assembly.<a name=399:10></a> He is also greater than Moses, and He communicates the mind of God, God's present thoughts and interests; and as all His grace is vouchsafed to the assembly, He is there known as Head of the body.<a name=399:11></a> As you derive from Him you are more effective in the house.<a name=399:12></a> When you know union with Him you are in consonance with His mind, and receive of His power to carry out His pleasure here.<a name=399:13></a> Hence in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>, where the body is spoken of, every member contributes to the welfare and effectiveness of all in the assembly.<a name=399:14></a> I trust that you apprehend these two sections.<a name=399:15></a>

		Next I turn to Christ as the Priest.<a name=421:2></a> You must know Christ as your Saviour before you could know Him as Priest.<a name=421:3></a> First you know that you are brought to God; next, that the Priest maintains you in the blessedness of Himself in the presence of God.<a name=421:4></a> As you read in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:20">John  14:20</a>, "In that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you".<a name=421:5></a> You are "within the veil, where Jesus is entered as forerunner for us become for ever a high priest according to the order of Melchisedec" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#6:20">Hebrews  6:20</a>).<a name=421:6></a> The moment you accept the fact that Christ is the great Priest over the house of God your heart will say, Where is He?<a name=421:7></a> It is a great moment in the history of the soul when the heart is really drawn to Christ where He is.<a name=421:8></a> When you know Him as Priest, you know that He maintains you in His own brightness in the holiest of all - "a great priest over the house of God".<a name=421:9></a> But besides this, which is the climax, you are going through a world of sorrow and difficulty, and you feel your infirmity, and if you are following Him, the word assures you, for it says, "Having therefore a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#4:14">Hebrews  4:14</a>).<a name=421:10></a> He is "able to sympathise with our infirmities", was "tempted in all things in like manner, sin apart" (verse 15), and He draws you to Himself.<a name=421:11></a> He does not alter things here.<a name=421:12></a> Many look for Him as "a very present help in trouble", but His sympathy is much more.<a name=421:13></a> When Peter was beginning to sink, the Lord stretched out His hand and caught him, and drew him to His own side.<a name=421:14></a> He did not smooth the waters, they were as rough as ever; but Christ brought him to His own side, a divine calm out of all here.<a name=421:15></a> If you taste of this wonderful relief, you will be severed from the place where Christ is not, and be attached to Himself in the place where He is.<a name=421:16></a> No one is really detached from

	<div class="paragraph">
		Next I turn to the effect of being drawn to Him, as we read in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:1">Hebrews  12:1</a> "Let us also therefore, .<a name=422:12></a>.<a name=422:13></a>.<a name=422:14></a> laying aside every weight, and sin which so easily entangles us, run with endurance the race that lies before us".<a name=422:15></a> You are running on to Himself.<a name=422:16></a> Until Israel were established in grace in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21">Numbers  21</a>, they were not set on entering the land.<a name=422:17></a> When you have found your place with Him in the holiest, you are in the race here.<a name=422:18></a> You are "looking stedfastly on Jesus the leader and completer of faith: who, in view of the joy lying before him, endured the cross, having despised the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:2">Hebrews  12:2</a>).<a name=422:19></a> It is a journey of faith; you are in the wilderness, conscious of the absence of Christ, but surmounting everything between you and Him.<a name=422:20></a> He has gone all

		The next section I turn to is that the servant's place is in the Father's house.<a name=423:2></a> When I say a servant I do not mean a special class.<a name=423:3></a> "To each one of us has been given grace according to the measure of the gift of the Christ" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:7">Ephesians  4:7</a>).<a name=423:4></a> All are called to serve.<a name=423:5></a> A member which may appear of little use may be of great importance.<a name=423:6></a> In this vast infirmary the one who can serve most is the greatest.<a name=423:7></a> The Lord said, "If any one serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there also shall be my servant" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#12:26">John  12:26</a>).<a name=423:8></a> Could you wish for anything better?<a name=423:9></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:2">John  14:2</a> the Lord is leaving His own here to serve Him, and He says to them, "I go to prepare you a place".<a name=423:10></a> Do you think a true-hearted servant of Christ would expect to find a place where his Lord was rejected?<a name=423:11></a> The Lord counts on the heart of His servant.<a name=423:12></a> Hence His words, "They are not of the world, as I am not of the world .<a name=423:13></a>.<a name=423:14></a>.<a name=423:15></a> As thou hast sent me into the world, I also have sent them into the world" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#17:16">John  17:16</a> - 18).<a name=423:16></a> You will see, I trust, that the heart true to Christ cannot seek a place here, that His servant is not looking for a place where his Lord was rejected, but that he is here for Him; and his present reward is, "Where I am, there also shall be my servant".<a name=423:17></a> Nothing can be plainer, even to natural feelings, than that you could not accept a place where a beloved one was refused.<a name=423:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have already spoken of the great supper, and of knowing Christ as Priest.<a name=423:19></a> I now come to the solemn but blessed fact that you cannot be fully in Christ's confidence, you are not in consonance with Him, until you are in conscious union with Him in heaven, and then you are in heavenly power.<a name=423:20></a> You are never in His full confidence until then.<a name=423:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One word more as to the servant: until you are in heavenly power you cannot be superior to the power of Satan; as we read in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#6:10">Ephesians  6:10</a>, "Be strong in the Lord, and in the might of his strength .<a name=424:8></a>.<a name=424:9></a>.<a name=424:10></a> and, having accomplished all things, to stand".<a name=424:11></a> "The ruler of this world is judged".<a name=424:12></a> The heavenly man can stand for the Lord against all the power of the enemy.<a name=424:13></a> If you are in heavenly power you are superior to all the power and machination of Satan.<a name=424:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I need not add more on the servant and how essential it is that he should be in heavenly power, but I must dwell a little on the course which is incumbent on every christian if he would progress.<a name=424:15></a> We all in a measure, I suppose, accept the truth that Christ is the Head of the church, but how do we learn it?<a name=424:16></a> In <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:20">Colossians  2:20</a> we read, "If ye have died with Christ from the elements of the world".<a name=424:17></a> In Romans, which I have referred to already in connection with enjoying the great supper, you are dead to sin as you walk in

		Our subject this evening is the opposition which we encounter.<a name=428:1></a> Before the coming of Christ the effort of Satan was to divert man from God in the worshipping of idols.<a name=428:2></a> But when Christ came the opposition was against Him, as you read in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#12">Revelation  12</a>.<a name=428:3></a> The effort of Satan through Herod was to destroy Him; with this intent from two years old and under every child was slain.<a name=428:4></a> "Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#2:18">Matthew  2:18</a>).<a name=428:5></a> The opposition now is against a Man, "the man Christ Jesus".<a name=428:6></a> God, of course, could always control Satan; but man was under Satan until Christ came.<a name=428:7></a> It is important to bear this in mind, hence in the opening of the gospel by Mark, you find that Christ's first work was to cast the unclean spirit out of a man, and then Satan exclaims, "I know thee who thou art, the holy one of God" (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#1:24">Mark  1:24</a>).<a name=428:8></a> It is inconceivably great that a Man has come who can dislodge the power of, Satan, so that you find further on in <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#5:10">Mark  5:10</a>: "And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country" - that the devil owned His power, that there was a Man who could dispossess him.<a name=428:9></a> Finally, Christ enters into death, as we read in another place, "Since therefore the children partake of blood and flesh, he also, in like manner, took part in the same, that through death he might annul" - not death only, but - "him who has the might of death, that is, the devil; and might set free all those who through fear of death through the whole of their life were subject to bondage" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:14">Hebrews  2:14</a>, 15).<a name=428:10></a> And as you find it testified by the scripture, "The ruler of the world comes, and in me he has nothing" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#14:30">John  14:30</a>).<a name=428:11></a> Nay more, as I hope to show you presently, you get in <a href="../bible/John.htm#16:11">John  16:11</a> "The ruler of this

		But I want first to interest you in the great fact that Satan has been overcome by Christ; a Man here on this earth has overcome him, and that Man has gone to the right hand of God.<a name=429:4></a> Therefore it says that He has "annulled death, and brought to light life and incorruptibility by the glad tidings" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1:10">2 Timothy  1:10</a>).<a name=429:5></a> The believer can now say as to death, "Thanks to God, who gives us the victory by our Lord Jesus Christ" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:57">1 Corinthians  15:57</a>).<a name=429:6></a> Now I have to try and present to you what is the character of Satan's opposition, and I turn for that to <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13">Matthew  13</a>.<a name=429:7></a> In that chapter there are seven parables, only six similitudes; the first is that the seed of the kingdom is sown; it is all good seed, and some takes root, and some does not through the power of Satan; Satan carries it away.<a name=429:8></a> That is the good seed.<a name=429:9></a> But then come the tares; and what are the tares?<a name=429:10></a> An imitation of the real thing, profession; professors are found in the church.<a name=429:11></a> When you look round, it is what I may call a standing miracle that the word of God in the hands of man has brought about this great system called christendom, that the Roman earth has become what you call 'christian.<a name=429:12></a>' And through what instrumentality?<a name=429:13></a> You might expect there was some reality in it, for it was all effected by the word of God, but through the human mind, and the result you get in those three similitudes: the tares, that is, profession without reality; the mustard tree, a huge system that grew up; and the leaven, "until it had been all leavened".<a name=429:14></a> There is not to my knowledge a single

		doctrine in christendom that is pure and without mixture according to the word of God.<a name=430:1></a> I am looking at the character of the opposition, because you may say we know the truth better, but remember, "evil communications corrupt good manners" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:33">1 Corinthians  15:33</a>); we are all brought up more or less connected with system, and you have to learn the character of things all around; it is all profession, not paganism, but nominal christianity; it is the leaven.<a name=430:2></a> And that led to the fact that vessels to dishonour were found in the house of God very early.<a name=430:3></a> As we see in the epistle to the Corinthians, leaven was tolerated, that is how the opposition worked; there was no right sense of what was due in the house of God.<a name=430:4></a> And when vessels to dishonour were tolerated in the house the faithful had to purge themselves from them.<a name=430:5></a> separation became necessary; you have to purge yourself from the vessels to dishonour, and "pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:22">2 Timothy  2:22</a>.<a name=430:6></a> That is the general character of things around.<a name=430:7></a> But there was a worse state than that, for while we get in 2 Timothy 2 that they erred from the truth, we get a deeper thing in chapter 3, that in the last days they resist the truth, and we are there.<a name=430:8></a> And if you ask what characterises it, it is a "form of piety but denying the power of it" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#3:5">2 Timothy  3:5</a>).<a name=430:9></a> I say to anyone who has been brought up as we all have been more or less, what is around you?<a name=430:10></a> Great religious profession, churches, ministers; it is all materialised, man does it all.<a name=430:11></a> Can anything surpass the masterpiece of Satan, his artifice to divert the soul from the right thing?<a name=430:12></a> There is a church for you, and a minister for you, it is all made to your hand, and it is all materialism.<a name=430:13></a> You have to rise out of it, and the only way to rise out of it is to get to the top; nothing else will save you.<a name=430:14></a> I want the youngest in this room to be alive to the character of the opposition that is abroad.<a name=430:15></a> A man may say he has nothing to do with it, but we are all affected by it, and we are all responsible;

		I turn now from what is outside to what is inside, to the direct opposition of Satan to any child of God.<a name=431:3></a> I believe the first great lack in the believer is that the dispensation according to God is not known.<a name=431:4></a> If you do not understand the calling or dispensation, though you are saved, you do not know what you are saved for.<a name=431:5></a> The mass of christians in christendom at this present moment never get beyond the Lord's prayer, that is, Jesus on the earth.<a name=431:6></a> What is the dispensation?<a name=431:7></a> The Holy Spirit is here.<a name=431:8></a> You hear continually christians praying for the Holy Spirit, a sure sign that they do not know anything about it, and are exposing themselves to all the delusions of Satan, like the Irvingites.<a name=431:9></a> I remember when young being very much taken up with praying for the Holy Spirit, and a beloved man of God saying to me.<a name=431:10></a> He is in the vessels.<a name=431:11></a> That altered everything to me.<a name=431:12></a> But I am referring to the direct character of the opposition; the first thing a man knows is that the blood of Christ saves his soul, but he gets no further as a rule; he never gets out of Egypt, and therefore he is occupied with worldly things, he does not know what he is saved for.<a name=431:13></a> There is no link whatever to Christ risen but the Holy Spirit, there could not possibly be.<a name=431:14></a> The flesh could not be the link; Christ has overcome, He has borne the judgment upon man, He has terminated that order of being in the sight of God in judgment, and now He is risen from the dead and glorified; and the testimony, or if you like, the response which He makes to you, believing in Him risen, is the "living water".<a name=431:15></a> There is no other link with Christ risen but the Holy Spirit.<a name=431:16></a> But I am speaking of the direct opposition of Satan, and now I say the first effort of it is to keep you in Egypt.<a name=431:17></a>

		in it, caught by the earthly thing.<a name=432:1></a> You will find this - it is a very simple rule to me - the one thing that Satan is against is the Man Christ Jesus.<a name=432:2></a> I have already quoted <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#12">Revelation  12</a>, where his whole point was to prevent Him being born into this world.<a name=432:3></a> When the "man child", which includes the church, is caught up, Satan will be cast down.<a name=432:4></a> I believe that is the only allusion to the rapture in the Revelation; we are all to go up together, because the man child in fulness is not caught up till we are caught up, and then Satan is cast down to the earth, there is no place for him in heaven.<a name=432:5></a> I am only showing you what Satan's opposition is; he cannot frustrate the work of God, but he tries to counteract it in every way he can.<a name=432:6></a> Hence, though you may have got out of Egypt and have learnt by grace that you are out, you may be drawn back into it.<a name=432:7></a> And even if you are not, you come to what I may call the next form of opposition, and that is, Balaam association.<a name=432:8></a> There is hardly a man I know of that has not suffered from his company.<a name=432:9></a> No matter how good the company a man keeps, he is coloured by the lowest, and Satan has gained his point.<a name=432:10></a> You see how Israel were drawn away, and what destruction came upon them because of it.<a name=432:11></a> And we are drawn away by it, as I have already quoted the scripture, "Evil communications corrupt good manners".<a name=432:12></a> Therefore in Corinthians we are warned that if a man saw another eat sitting in an idol's temple it defiled his weak conscience.<a name=432:13></a> Happy is the man that is not influenced by other people!<a name=432:14></a> This is what I call the direct opposition.<a name=432:15></a>

		Now I turn to another form of it, and that is, what we suffer from inside.<a name=432:16></a> I think the first great snare that christians suffer from is making the law the rule of life; there is something so specious about presenting God's law.<a name=432:17></a> And when we think of who is opposing, we need not wonder at it.<a name=432:18></a> Satan was against God's law before Christ came, but now you will be unmolested

		Now I come to two more forms which affect us in different ways.<a name=433:10></a> It all shows how subtle the enemy is.<a name=433:11></a> One speaks of the work that is done <i>for</i> you, what is called objective, but ignores the work <i>in</i> you.<a name=433:12></a> Of course it is all done <i>for</i> you; but you must not leave out the Spirit, by whom it is all done <i>in</i> you.<a name=433:13></a> You must have both.<a name=433:14></a> I do not like the words, but you must have not only the objective but the subjective.<a name=433:15></a> I do not want to say anything unkind; but to say it is all done for me, without having the subjective, terminates, I believe, in Laodicea; there is no really vital work there.<a name=433:16></a> I have no doubt that there is no machination of the devil that has worked more insidiously amongst us.<a name=433:17></a> While it was most blessed and necessary to bring out that it was all done for us - the completeness of grace - there is another side, the work of the Spirit; there is not only the work done <i>for</i> me, but the work done <i>in</i> me.<a name=433:18></a> On the other hand, we have to contend with the Arminian snare which makes it all our attainment.<a name=433:19></a> The evil of that is that it leaves Christ out; the attainment school want to make it all originate with themselves.<a name=433:20></a> The subtlety of Satan is

		There is only one more form of opposition that I will refer to, but it is a very large one, and I commend it very much to your notice.<a name=434:5></a> The tendency of us all, in fact of almost every one I meet with is to limit the truth; that is Satan's object, to prevent you from getting the finish.<a name=434:6></a> It is important to be exercised about all these things.<a name=434:7></a> If a person is asked about any truth, he may know part of it, but he does not know the crown of the grace, the finish of it.<a name=434:8></a> If I speak to a man about the gospel, I find that he knows Christ died and perhaps Christ risen, but he does not know Christ glorified; it does not occur to him, and I have even known it resisted.<a name=434:9></a> Yet surely the heart that knows it at all knows that nothing less will do.<a name=434:10></a> The light comes from the glorified Christ - "If also our gospel is veiled, it is veiled in those that are lost; in whom the god of this world has blinded the thoughts of the unbelieving, so that the radiancy of the glad tidings of the glory of the Christ, who is the image of God, should not shine forth for them" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:3">2 Corinthians  4:3</a>, 4); it comes down from the top.<a name=434:11></a> I quite admit it is some time before one gets to it, but I am looking at where God begins; God begins from the finish.<a name=434:12></a> And you will find that many will take a part of a truth, take a part of Christ's life, for instance, and not take the finish of it; and so it is with regard to all truth, the object of Satan is

		Our subject this evening is our manner of life here and the more I ponder it (and I am sure it will be the testimony of every one who ponders it), the more interesting it is.<a name=440:1></a> It is so sublime, as if it were beyond us, yet it becomes clearer to us as we are set for it.<a name=440:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I divide the subject into three parts.<a name=440:3></a> The first part is in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12">Romans  12</a>, a justified man on earth, you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit; if you have not the first part, you will not have the other two, which I will come to afterwards.<a name=440:4></a> The first trait of this is that your body is the Lord's; you are under a new control altogether.<a name=440:5></a> It is not quite as simple as one may imagine, but the more you look into it the more it grows upon you.<a name=440:6></a> You are under a very much better rule than you were; your will was your master, and if you know yourself at all, you know that at one time you would be very lenient with yourself, and at other times too exacting.<a name=440:7></a> But there is evenness in the Lord's control; He knows what you are equal to, and He never looks for more; "He taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#147:10">Psalm  147:10</a>).<a name=440:8></a> The great principle you start with is that your body is the Lord's - "Be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God".<a name=440:9></a> I have read a little more, for the next thing is the church, His body.<a name=440:10></a> The first claim is that your body is the Lord's; the next claim is the church, which is His body.<a name=440:11></a> "For, as in one body we have many members, but all the members have not the same office; thus we, being many, are one body in Christ, and each one members one of the other".<a name=440:12></a> But I do not dwell on it; you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit: that is the start.<a name=440:13></a>

		Our subject is our manner of life here: the first trait is that your body is the Lord's; the next, the church - His interests are yours; and then, your relations with christians.<a name=441:1></a> Finally, in the end of this chapter, you suffer from evil.<a name=441:2></a> I must connect the two chapters, 12 and 13.<a name=441:3></a> Chapter 13 is outside - the powers that be, you are subject to the powers that be, but you are not a citizen here.<a name=441:4></a> Then you come to your general duty to your neighbour; you are to "owe no one anything, unless to love one another: for he that loves another has fulfilled the law".<a name=441:5></a> You leave everything as it stands, and do not interfere with anything.<a name=441:6></a> "Love works no ill to its neighbour; love therefore is the whole law".<a name=441:7></a> I do not go into it, but love is a wonderful thing when it rules you.<a name=441:8></a> When our Lord wanted to show what was the contrast between Himself and the law, He gave us the parable of the man that fell among thieves; the Samaritan went a good deal beyond the law; the priest passed by on the other side, but the Samaritan not only cured him, but carried him, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him, and then when he went away he said, "Take care of him, and whatsoever thou shalt expend more, I will render to thee on my coming back" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10:35">Luke  10:35</a>).<a name=441:9></a> It showed he was willing to put himself under a bond for him, just as a father might do for a child; I am quite willing, he says, to put myself under a bond.<a name=441:10></a> One word more before I have done with this part, and that is in <a href="../bible/chapter.htm#13:11">chapter  13:11</a> - 14, "This also, knowing the time, that it is already time that we should be aroused out of sleep; for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.<a name=441:11></a> The night is far spent, and the day is near; let us cast away therefore the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.<a name=441:12></a> As in the day, let us walk becomingly" - it is not the rapture here; the day always indicates our responsibility - "not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and lasciviousness, not in strife and emulation.<a name=441:13></a> But put on

		the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not take forethought for the flesh to fulfil its lusts".<a name=442:1></a> This is the first part: you are dead to sin, you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, and you come out in this new way upon the earth.<a name=442:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I turn to the second, which we shall find in Hebrews 12: 1, 2 "Let us also therefore, having so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, laying aside every weight, and sin which so easily entangles us, run with endurance the race that lies before us, looking stedfastly on Jesus the leader and completer of faith: who, in view of the joy lying before him, endured the cross, having despised the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God".<a name=442:3></a> Well, anyone who considers for a moment can see the difference between the two parts: one is, that you are dead to sin, that you part company from the man here; but now you leave this place and run on to where Christ is; that is the race.<a name=442:4></a> The apostle warns the Hebrews, who had turned back, that that was the failure of their forefathers; they were discouraged and showed an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God.<a name=442:5></a> And now he presses upon them the path of obedience.<a name=442:6></a> He shows how indispensable Christ is to them.<a name=442:7></a> In personal trials He only can comfort you.<a name=442:8></a> And He comforts you by drawing you to Himself.<a name=442:9></a> You know little about sorrow if you think it diminishes.<a name=442:10></a> As to joy, every new joy puts out the old ones; while in sorrow, every fresh sorrow revives all the old ones.<a name=442:11></a> You speak to a mother who has lost another of her children, and she will revert to the one she lost before; the new sorrow revives the old one.<a name=442:12></a> What is the only resource?<a name=442:13></a> The resource is the One who makes Himself more to us than anyone else; He draws us to Himself.<a name=442:14></a> And not only do we find solace for ourselves, but He introduces us into the circle where He Himself is "a great priest over the house of God", and there you find that you are brought into a sense of the blessedness of Christ's place in the presence of

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I turn to chapter 11; I trust you will find great profit in the study of it.<a name=443:6></a> There we start to leave this place; it is a journey of faith.<a name=443:7></a> I desire to bring before you three or four great stages in the journey of faith.<a name=443:8></a> I will take them in order, and that, I think, will explain it better.<a name=443:9></a> Where does the journey end?<a name=443:10></a> In the land where Christ is gone.<a name=443:11></a> We are looking out for Him; it is not that we are looking for a <i>place</i>, but we are looking for a <i>Person</i> where He is.<a name=443:12></a> Why?<a name=443:13></a> Because of what He is to you; He has drawn you out of this place; the attraction of One who is not in this place has drawn you out of it; you are running on to Him.<a name=443:14></a> And now I point out the stages; what I mean by 'stage' is when you get to a definite point.<a name=443:15></a> The first is Enoch, who was translated that he should not see death; he "was not found, because God had translated him".<a name=443:16></a> Then I go on to Noah; Noah is clear of the judgment upon man in the place where the judgment was, and he is in the favour of God upon the earth.<a name=443:17></a> Many a one who knows justification does not know that he is in the favour of God.<a name=443:18></a> That is number two.<a name=443:19></a> Number three is not so easy; that is Abraham; he looked for no place here, but "he waited for the city which has foundations, of which God is the artificer and constructor".<a name=443:20></a> Are you looking for that city?<a name=443:21></a> What was he here?<a name=443:22></a> A stranger and a pilgrim; it is not easy to be a stranger; but if you

		are not a stranger, you will not come to the next.<a name=444:1></a> It is important to see the character of the race, because you are leaving this place.<a name=444:2></a> Now it is not that you part company with man, that you are not in the flesh, but you are running a race.<a name=444:3></a> There can be no greater evidence that you have left man than that you have left his place, because the earth is given to man and suits him.<a name=444:4></a> Abraham was in the land, but had no place in it; "he waited for the city which has foundations" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:10">Hebrews  11:10</a>).<a name=444:5></a> "All these died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them from afar off and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and sojourners on the earth.<a name=444:6></a> For they who say such things shew clearly that they seek their country" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:13">Hebrews  11:13</a>, 14).<a name=444:7></a> Are you seeking your country?<a name=444:8></a> Are you a stranger and a pilgrim here?<a name=444:9></a> But that is not all.<a name=444:10></a> The next is Moses - the power of the enemy is broken; that is the great point.<a name=444:11></a> That is what you get practically in Christ's death, the power of the enemy is broken; and therefore, you get in the history of faith (which ends properly at verse 30), "By faith the walls of Jericho fell, having been encircled for seven days"; that is possession.<a name=444:12></a> Verse 30 shows that you are in possession.<a name=444:13></a> Verse 31 shows where the gentiles come in: "By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish along with the unbelieving, having received the spies in peace".<a name=444:14></a> I want you to understand where the race ends.<a name=444:15></a> You are not looking for a particular <i>place</i>, but for a <i>Person</i>, and therefore the sum of it is, "Let us .<a name=444:16></a>.<a name=444:17></a>.<a name=444:18></a> run with endurance the race that lies before us, looking stedfastly on Jesus the leader and completer of faith" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:1">Hebrews  12:1</a>, 2).<a name=444:19></a>

		Oh, that we might be led more into practical separation from everything here!<a name=445:4></a> As our blessed Lord said, "I sanctify myself for them, that they also may be sanctified by truth" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#17:19">John  17:19</a>).<a name=445:5></a> He is apart from everything.<a name=445:6></a> You are not subjected to discipline until you are ready for it; it is the stone before the wheel which is removed; there is no use in taking away the stone before the wheel comes up to it; when you feel the hindrance, God removes it.<a name=445:7></a> It is loss to you, it is death in a natural sense; but you find that your loss is gain.<a name=445:8></a>

		I trust you will study these two parts of our manner of life and get great profit from it: one is, you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, and you are to come out in a new way, as in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12">Romans  12</a>; the other is, you are drawn away to Christ in another place: it is a race.<a name=445:9></a> You will find that Israel were not in the race to Canaan until after <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21">Numbers  21</a>; they were <i>wandering</i> in the wilderness; but when they were set for Canaan, then the race began.<a name=445:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us see now what is the manner of life of a man who comes from heaven.<a name=446:4></a> You are sitting in heavenly places in Christ, and you are to come out in everything new; not merely in the church, but in your own house.<a name=446:5></a> You begin with union with Christ; this truth is essential.<a name=446:6></a> Some may say, We are not up to it.<a name=446:7></a> But all culminates (as we have seen in the previous addresses) in union with Christ; and that is the great thought of God for us.<a name=446:8></a> If you are not up to it, that is no reason why you should not be interested about it; it is right to feel how far short of it one is.<a name=446:9></a> I find that at no time do I learn so much as when I am sensible of how ignorant I am.<a name=446:10></a> The one who realises union with Christ will come out in power; he faces this world in a new way.<a name=446:11></a> It is not here a contrast with the old, as in Colossians, but it is coming out in the new, which "according to God is created in truthful righteousness and holiness"; you come out in the truth, the truth really of your position.<a name=446:12></a> When you look at it for a moment you see what an immense thing it is to understand that you come out a new man.<a name=446:13></a> Now you get some idea of what the truth is in Jesus; He came out from the brightness of eternal glory, the express image of God, to set forth divine beauty in every detail of human life down here.<a name=446:14></a> You may say, I cannot conceive it.<a name=446:15></a> No, nor can I.<a name=446:16></a> But it is so in everything; it is not merely obedience, but the way everything was done, the manner of it; not merely fulfilling the law,

		One or two things more I must dwell upon that you may understand the greatness of this position.<a name=447:18></a> It is an interesting fact that the two things which are to characterise you are love and light.<a name=447:19></a> I have been very much interested in looking at John's gospel to see that it is not only love, but it is light; we read, "He that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#8:12">John  8:12</a>).<a name=447:20></a> I refer to <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:1">Ephesians  5:1</a>, 25 - "Be
