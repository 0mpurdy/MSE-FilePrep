		On the second of October, 1895, my dearest father was leaving Edinburgh after a fortnight's course of Scripture readings, and when about to start for the station he fell on the last step of the stairs and hurt his right knee.<a name=3:7></a> Dr.<a name=3:8></a> Wolston begged him to remain at his house to be nursed, but he pursued his journey to Carlisle.<a name=3:9></a> Once at the house of our kind friends, the Misses Blaylock, he received every kindness and attention.<a name=3:10></a>

		On the 14th, I received a pencilled note in his own dear writing, and again on the 20th he wrote to me accepting the room at No.<a name=3:11></a> 2 West Park Terrace.<a name=3:12></a> On the 26th, Dr.<a name=3:13></a> Wolston went to Carlisle to see him, and recommended his coming home at once in an invalid carriage.<a name=3:14></a> He arrived here on the 29th.<a name=3:15></a> I met him at the station, and as I went into the carriage and saw him stretched, and kissed that dear, tired face, my heart told me he had come home for the last time.<a name=3:16></a>

		Still, he seemed so full of life and vigour, and the leg got well so nicely, that he was quite elated at being allowed to put it to the ground, and was counting on walking again, when he got an attack of coughing on the night of October 31st.<a name=4:3></a>

		November 17th.<a name=6:2></a> Lovely bright day.<a name=6:3></a> Read to him his favourite chapter, <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>, and in the afternoon he dictated a letter to Arthur Pridham.<a name=6:4></a> He said today, 'The outer man is to perish -- the inner man to be renewed.<a name=6:5></a> It is a wonderful thing to feel that one is delivered from all the folly and selfishness of one's past life.<a name=6:6></a> It is a new experience to me to lie here -- now seven Sundays'.<a name=6:7></a>

		Tuesday, November 19th.<a name=6:8></a> Lovely bright day -- like summer.<a name=6:9></a> He said today, 'I am learning that even with one foot in Jordan -- I mean appropriating Christ's death -- everything here assumes its true colour as a dry and barren land where no water is, but the sphere of His life gleams before me on the other side, where there is perennial joy in His Presence.<a name=6:10></a> I have had a great sense of deliverance in reviewing my life, and various mistakes and follies, and with inexpressible fervour I am able to say that I can thank God I am free of that man and that I am 'in Christ for ever'.<a name=6:11></a>

		Saturday, December 14th.<a name=7:11></a> In the early morning I was awakened by his dear voice saying in loud, clear tones (see May 1st, 1897): 'To be found beside Him, that's what I look for'.<a name=7:12></a> I sprang to his side to listen but could only catch 'In His brightness (or likeness, it may have been) a glorious day is coming'.<a name=7:13></a> I said, 'All that you have ever taught us about the Lord gets truer and fuller, as you get nearer to His Presence'.<a name=7:14></a>

		In the beginning of his illness Hebrews had been before him, and the desire to know more deeply the Lord's sympathy in his infirmity of bodily weakness.<a name=11:4></a> Then it was <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>, and chapters 14, 15, 16, 7, and 4.<a name=11:5></a> Now he seemed filled with the Paul aspect of the Man out of heaven.<a name=11:6></a> He revived a little at 6 a.<a name=11:7></a>m.<a name=11:8></a> It was hard to catch a whole sentence, 'The great High Priest', then, again, 'I was beautiful in the night, and you called me back for food.<a name=11:9></a>.<a name=11:10></a>.<a name=11:11></a>.<a name=11:12></a> New order .<a name=11:13></a>.<a name=11:14></a>.<a name=11:15></a> New life .<a name=11:16></a>.<a name=11:17></a>.<a name=11:18></a> waiting for Him', and at another time, in a clear voice, 'It is a grand confirmation!<a name=11:19></a>'

		His mind was very clear, and he talked so cheerily to his doctor, who pronounced him much better, saying, as he left the room, 'He is a wonderful man, and as happy as a king!<a name=12:2></a>' The long sleep had been for a rally, and for the removing of all the most distressing symptoms of heart and lungs.<a name=12:3></a> As I sat silently beside him I could see that his mind was wide awake and traversing the courts above.<a name=12:4></a> I listened while odd words and sentences dropped from his loved lips, fearful lest any words of mine should intrude upon the blessed intercourse that was going on between the Master and servant; the coming day alone will reveal what this time has been to him: but the calm brow, the smile of heavenly peace, makes me think of the vessel full of light -- the light of God's satisfaction shining through the earthen vessel.<a name=12:5></a> While even down here, and on a bed of languishing, he is learning and finding what it is to dwell in a region of satisfied desire -- in the enjoyment of eternal life in a risen and glorified Christ.<a name=12:6></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have been dwelling much upon the marks of a man who had learned that he is in Christ, and not in Adam.<a name=66:10></a> This has led me with deep interest to the subject of God's purpose for the church, suggested to me by the words, "Take heed therefore how ye hear" (Luke 8: 18).<a name=66:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I see that there are seven steps or stages in the range of God's purpose for us -- beginning with salvation and ending with union.<a name=66:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First -- salvation is appropriated as well
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=67>[Page 67]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		as apprehended by faith, because it is God's grace transferring you from Adam to Christ.<a name=67:1></a> In Christ you are on new ground.<a name=67:2></a> If you do not accept this, you make no advance because it is in the life of Christ you have deliverance.<a name=67:3></a> Many who want to make the other steps appropriated by faith, are greatly deceived, they can learn very clearly from Scripture the other steps, and speak of them very accurately and interestingly -- as one would write poetry, which is really carrying you in imagination beyond your experience -- but if you have learned the first step, you are in Christ -- in His life -- you know His love; you know some thing in addition to salvation.<a name=67:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next -- When you reach the Living Stone in the assembly, your heart will rejoice, and your joy no man shall take from you.<a name=67:5></a> You gain immensely because you are led into the blessedness of His acceptance before God, in the Holiest of all.<a name=67:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then -- according as you are led, you can serve Him here; quite a new day for you.<a name=67:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Fourthly -- When you enter into the great fact that you are dead with Him from the rudiments of the world, you have reached Him in His own sphere; and
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Fifthly -- you are there serving Him according to His direction.<a name=67:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=68>[Page 68]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Sixthly -- Now is made known to you that you are united to Him in heaven, making known to you the wonderful blessedness of being so near Him, knowing His love, and in His perfect confidence; and
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Finally -- you come out as a new man in heavenly power to maintain for Him, in face of all opposition in this present scene, waiting for His appearing.<a name=68:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How many only know the first -- salvation -- and they have no joy beyond the joy of salvation.<a name=68:2></a> They can speak correctly of all the other stages, but are never in the enjoyment of them, and do not give you the impression of having acquired anything GREAT.<a name=68:3></a> It is mental acquisition instead of experimental .<a name=68:4></a>.<a name=68:5></a>.<a name=68:6></a> I think it accounts for many who are happy in their salvation who do not seem to have acquired anything but their salvation, and all the immense blessings which would follow are unknown to them.<a name=68:7></a>
