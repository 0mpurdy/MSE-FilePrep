		THE LIFEBOAT AND THE SHORE

	<div class="paragraph">
		I must send you a short review of the state of Christians in general, or rather of the measure in which Christianity is known.<a name=11:18></a> I do not refer to mere professors: I confine my remarks to really converted souls.<a name=11:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		No one has any hope of safety who does not believe in the efficacy of the blood of Christ in the eye of God, as we read in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#12:13">Exodus  12:13</a>, "When I see the blood, I will pass over you"; and <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3:25">Romans  3:25</a>.<a name=11:20></a> "Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God".<a name=11:21></a>

		This is the first step.<a name=12:1></a> Thus you have assurance that you will not be lost; you are like one in a lifeboat, saved from drowning, but you are still in the water, or in the place where all the danger is.<a name=12:2></a> From Abel down this step or state was known to the man of faith.<a name=12:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next step is the new state, never known until Christ was raised from the dead.<a name=12:4></a> There was no resurrection of any sacrifice until Christ rose.<a name=12:5></a> Until the resurrection of Christ is apprehended as it is in the sight of God, you are not out of the lifeboat; no happy place, be assured, though there be a sure hope of safety.<a name=12:6></a> But no one who had been rescued from a watery grave would like to remain in the place where death stared him in the face; he longs for the <i>shore</i>, and however he may be assured of his safety, his hopes, his thoughts, his enjoyment never rise beyond safety.<a name=12:7></a> Safety is the only bright prospect before him.<a name=12:8></a> Now through the resurrection of Christ you reach <i>the shore</i> -- the new, the Christian ground.<a name=12:9></a> In type Israel (see <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#14">Exodus  14</a>) found a way through the Red Sea.<a name=12:10></a> God's light showed them the way; they <i>walked</i> it; they appropriated the way made for them through the sea.<a name=12:11></a> By faith the Christian appropriates the way made through death, through Christ's death and resurrection, so that like Israel he can sing, "I will sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he cast into the sea".<a name=12:12></a> See <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15:1">Exodus  15:1</a>.<a name=12:13></a> So can you, when you believe that God raised Christ from the dead, for "being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:1">Romans  5:1</a>).<a name=12:14></a> All our enemies have sunk like lead in the mighty waters.<a name=12:15></a> Until the value of the resurrection is seen, there cannot be any Christian progress.<a name=12:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is here the divergence of one Christian from another begins.<a name=12:17></a> Christ was delivered for our offences and raised for our justification.<a name=12:18></a> You cannot enjoy justification until you believe in your heart that God hath raised Christ from the dead.<a name=12:19></a> It is seeing <i>a Man</i>, who had borne the death due to you, raised out of death, which obtains peace for you.<a name=12:20></a> The man (Adam) under the judgment of death has been judicially ended in the cross of Christ, and "For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection

		of the dead" (1 Corinthians 15: 21).<a name=13:1></a> God now can "be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3:26">Romans  3:26</a>).<a name=13:2></a> The man under judgment has borne the judgment in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ; hence, as you believe on Him <i>risen</i>, you are entirely on new ground; you are on <i>the shore; you are in the cloudless favour of God</i>.<a name=13:3></a> God has effected your reconciliation; He can receive the returning prodigal with open arms.<a name=13:4></a> Adam, the first man, has for every believer, to the eye of God, disappeared in judgment in the cross; hence the Christian can say, 'I <i>did</i> belong to the man under the judgment of God, but I am through grace freed of that man in the death of Christ; I have passed out of death into life'.<a name=13:5></a> "If we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:8">Romans  6:8</a>).<a name=13:6></a> If you believe in the resurrection of Christ, and therefore see that you are <i>seen</i> by God as now belonging to another Man -- the Man risen from the dead -- you begin to progress as a Christian.<a name=13:7></a> You are freed from the old man in the sight of God, but if you truly enjoy this, you will seek to be freed from sin as to yourself, "dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:11">Romans  6:11</a>).<a name=13:8></a> It could not be otherwise.<a name=13:9></a> If the blessed God sees you to His heart's delight in all the acceptance of Christ, surely, when you know this, the next step must be that you should be practically as clear of the old man, and this is made true to you as you "walk in the Spirit", for then you would not "fulfil the lusts of the flesh".<a name=13:10></a> See <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#6:16">Galatians  6:16</a>.<a name=13:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is lamentable how little Christians have believed in Christ <i>risen</i>.<a name=13:12></a> The reason is, as far as I see, that they, though thankful to be safe, are not prepared to be severed from the old man and to be now exclusively <i>for and of Christ</i>.<a name=13:13></a> They do not prefer Christ to Adam, and you cannot apprehend the resurrection of Christ except you see <i>one</i> man gone in death and the second Man <i>risen</i> out from among the dead.<a name=13:14></a> If you are of the Second you cannot be of the first, the two cannot go on together

		THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PLACE OF SAINTS NOW AND BEFORE THE ASCENSION OF CHRIST
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have been thinking much of the difference between our place on earth, and that of the saints before the ascension of Christ.<a name=15:1></a> Since the rejection of Christ and His sitting down in glory, the whole of this world is unproductive of anything for one of His.<a name=15:2></a> Before His rejection, even during His walk on earth, the earth yielded something; He was here, and from His hand it was made to yield.<a name=15:3></a> He obliged evil and adverse things here to give way; infirmities were overborne, and made to yield present blessing to His people.<a name=15:4></a> Now since the rejection of the Lord, and His sitting down in heaven, there is a new scene where the blessing is unhinderedly enjoyed, and the "man in Christ" is there with Him.<a name=15:5></a> There I find I am blessed with all spiritual blessing.<a name=15:6></a> If I am blessed with <i>all</i> there, then I am of course not to expect to find any here; but this is quite a new and difficult lesson for the saint to learn.<a name=15:7></a> If I can find no spiritual blessing here, then I must feel this to be a desert.<a name=15:8></a> If spiritual blessing is now known to my soul as the true blessing, then I must accept this -- that there is none of that order to be found here, but all in heaven.<a name=15:9></a> This of itself in a very peculiar and distinct way diverts the soul from this scene, and turns it to heaven.<a name=15:10></a> But even after one has learnt that there is no spiritual blessing anywhere but in heaven, there is exercise of soul in walking through this scene, even though we may have ceased to expect from it.<a name=15:11></a> This is not an easy thing for the saint in full consciousness of the rights of God.<a name=15:12></a> A "young man" who had "overcome the wicked one" would naturally say to himself that God has rights in the world, and that he was at liberty to claim them and possess them, and therefore it is said to such (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:15">1 John  2:15</a>): "Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world".<a name=15:13></a>

		<a name=16>[Page 16]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God's thought and love for His people, such as they could appreciate.<a name=16:1></a> <i>Now</i> that expression of His love is made in heaven, where there is no force used to produce it.<a name=16:2></a> It is all for acceptance on our part, and our enjoyment depends on the amount or extent of our acceptance of it.<a name=16:3></a> There we are furnished as Paul was, outside and above all of earth and man, and when down here, instead of finding anything to help me, and to afford strength and joy to me, I find everything the reverse; so that instead of its being the garden of the Lord, as it was to the Old Testament saint when he walked faithfully, it is a desert, where not only there is nothing that contributes to me, but where I must resist the very air, because it is pestilential, and I must, on this desert island where I am set as Christ's witness, draw all my supplies from elsewhere.<a name=16:4></a> The harbour where the supplies come in, is the only cheering spot in this dry and barren land where no water is.<a name=16:5></a> I must seek and receive from <i>outside</i> of this desert land, but I must refuse all <i>in it</i>.<a name=16:6></a> The Old Testament saint sought, and received in it; the mighty power of God fed him -- the faithful one, with the finest of the wheat, and with honey out of the rock satisfied him; but now, while you are here, there is not anything for you here, but all your supplies must come to you from above; you must enjoy them above; and here, you have only the power of Christ to make you strong in your weakness, so that a sense of weakness is a gain.<a name=16:7></a> I am looking to Christ who is above this scene, and I know His power in my weakness, and my enjoyment is not from this scene but completely outside of it, with Him in heaven.<a name=16:8></a> The Old Testament saint had joy from God's gifts to him here, and knew His power in making things here contribute to him.<a name=16:9></a> <i>I</i> know and have joy outside of it in heaven from what God has given me <i>there</i>, and here I do not seek that anything should contribute to me, but while I resist everything in the power of Christ, I become a contributor of the grace which nourishes and comforts me outside of it in heaven.<a name=16:10></a> But I need Christ's power to enable me to rise above my sense of infirmity in this scene, so that not only does this scene not contribute to me, but it makes me feel my weakness and need, and that I not only have to rise <i>out of it</i> to find

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With the Old Testament saint the infirmities were removed, and everything was by the power of God made to contribute to His people.<a name=17:2></a> Hence it is a great change, and often a difficult lesson to accept fully that nothing contributes to me in this scene, but on the contrary that I take pleasure in my infirmity in it, in order that the power of Christ may rest on me.<a name=17:3></a> I am not only not contributed to here, but my infirmity is exposed, and it becomes a pleasure to me that Christ's power may rest on me.<a name=17:4></a>

		Every believer likes the gospel, but no one really apprehends the gospel who is not across the Red Sea, and no one enjoys union with Christ who is not over Jordan.<a name=17:6></a> I do not think that any one can accept Jordan until he is drawn over by the object of his heart; with Israel it was the <i>place</i>, with us it is the <i>Person</i>.<a name=17:7></a> Many a one can delight in God's grace to him who is not sufficiently attached to Christ to leave everything here to <i>join Him</i> outside of everything here.<a name=17:8></a> There is a large field of blessing belonging to the gospel while we are here on the earth; but in the church we are united to the glorified Man in heaven, and as you apprehend it an entirely new world is opened out to you, in which you cannot be but in Christ's life, out-side of your senses.<a name=17:9></a> I believe if saints had truly known their relation to Christ, that they would have been preserved in the late sifting.<a name=17:10></a>

		Secondly, I admit that John and Paul are distinct lines, but surely the spiritual man can recognise where they coalesce, as the up line would with the down line.<a name=49:2></a> Paul is the up line, John the down line.<a name=49:3></a> J.<a name=49:4></a>N.<a name=49:5></a>D.<a name=49:6></a> says that the child in John is not up to the perfect in <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3">Philippians  3</a>, that he has not learned himself.<a name=49:7></a> Neither the babes nor the young men are in a bad state (I never heard that said); but they are in a young or immatured state.<a name=49:8></a> The babe in John is not at all the same as the babe in 1 Corinthians.<a name=49:9></a> The babes in 1 Corinthians were carnal; but in John it is that they were not as matured as the fathers; they had to combat, step by step, the antagonism in this scene, just as a tropical plant would have to be strengthened to be proof against an ungenial climate.<a name=49:10></a> I do not see how any one could be a father unless he had been first a babe.<a name=49:11></a>

		Thirdly, the main question, as I understand it, is, What is the nature and condition of the life which the fathers intelligently realise?<a name=49:12></a> The three classes have it as God's gift, but the fathers really are consciously in it.<a name=49:13></a> You say it is the basis for walk; I admit this in a way, but surely walk is not all?<a name=49:14></a> Walk certainly is the path here, but there is the life of communion with the Father and the Son.<a name=49:15></a> The great point of John's epistle is, that we might be in conscious knowledge of eternal life.<a name=49:16></a> See chapter 5.<a name=49:17></a> It was manifested by our blessed Lord.<a name=49:18></a> Though He humbled Himself, became a Man, and walked here in the life of flesh, in all His ways as a man He acted consistently with His own proper life in which He was all the time in the Father's bosom; so that in leaving us an example to follow His steps, we are not only to seek to live as He lived <i>here</i>, but as He now lives unto God.<a name=49:19></a>.<a name=49:20></a>.<a name=49:21></a>.<a name=49:22></a>

		First let me tell you that if you are looking for authority or ground for faith in the faith of another you will surely miss it, though you may find, and you <i>will</i> find, confirmation for your faith in the way the one who has like faith has acted, and has learned of God.<a name=54:1></a> You (every one) ought to see the divine mind first about any point, and that is faith, derived from no circumstances or example though afterwards it is often corroborated by both.<a name=54:2></a> Baptism is the expression of the end of the first Adam in the death of Christ.<a name=54:3></a> A believing parent holds this truth without limitation or qualification, and the one who enters by faith into this great fact would shrink from being the parent of the first-Adam-being, if he could not avow before God that he does not recognise its existence (morally) in Adam, but that he can place it before God as an existence gone in the death of Christ, even as through grace he has found himself to be gone there.<a name=54:4></a> <i>Dreadful</i> if a Christian should be the reviver and author of an existence judged in the cross of Christ, unless he were permitted to place it in the same standing before God and man, as he had through God's grace been placed himself.<a name=54:5></a> If it were not so, it would be better never to have a child to perpetuate the race which was judicially ended in the cross of Christ, and if there were no liberty or privilege granted to me -- a Christian parent -- to place my children there and to avow them as <i>unto</i> Christ, apart from the race judicially terminated in His death.<a name=54:6></a> Here then I state that no careful reader of the example of faith in the Philippian jailor can fail to see that all rests on his faith.<a name=54:7></a> In the latest and most correct editions it reads (as J.<a name=54:8></a>N.<a name=54:9></a>D.<a name=54:10></a>):--'with (it is' with 'not' and ') all his house' -- or rather literally, 'they spake the word to him with all in the house', and 'was baptised himself and all his straightway'; and he having believed in God, rejoiced <i>householdly;</i> (an adverb); it is simply an expression of how joy filled the house!<a name=54:11></a> for certainly it refers to the <i>joy</i>, not to the <i>believing</i>, nothing can be plainer.<a name=54:12></a> But I rest nothing for a soul without faith, nor do I indeed press this truth, because I believe daily that it involves a home faithfulness that I.<a name=54:13></a> for one, feel little experienced in.<a name=54:14></a> I

		CHRIST IN US

	<div class="paragraph">
		As to the expression, "Christ in you" -- in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:27">Colossians  1:27</a> we find it definitely stated, and in <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:20">Galatians  2:20</a>, "Christ liveth in me".<a name=100:1></a> It is evident from Colossians that the great point there is, that Christ may altogether supersede the Adam man, for we find the result of the teaching in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3:11">Colossians  3:11</a> -- there is no other man of any kind, but "Christ is everything, and in all".<a name=100:2></a> This, to my mind, is the meaning of Christ in you.<a name=100:3></a> He gives you the hope of glory.<a name=100:4></a> Now accepting this, which cannot be denied, let us see the effects.<a name=100:5></a> It is plain that in Colossians we have not left the earth, and hence all the practice there refers to this present time, whether in the home circle, or in the assembly.<a name=100:6></a> This is important, because it determines the measure which Christ works in me.<a name=100:7></a> It is never said that eternal life lives in me, but that Christ, who is the eternal life, lives in me; <i>He is my life</i> -- a life not independent like my natural life.<a name=100:8></a> The life I have is in Christ, and He lives in me for heaven as well as for earth; but in the one I know Him as the old corn of the land, and in the other as the manna.<a name=100:9></a> The church (Jew and Gentile) is the one new man in Himself, and the Holy Ghost is given that we may express Him in the place where He is not, but in which we are.<a name=100:10></a> As you walk in the Spirit He enables you to walk here as Christ walked, and this many call eternal life, which is not true, though it is quite true that it was the walk of His Son (who is the Eternal life) while down here on this earth in the days of His humiliation.<a name=100:11></a> That is the manna, but it has ceased, though it is stored up in Christ for us, and supplied by Him to us now; but as we are in communion with Christ in glory, where He is, and where we are united to Him, we know Him there, and in company we feed on Him as the old corn of the land, where (laying aside the type) the eternal life is in its own sphere, and where we have communion with the Father and the Son.<a name=100:12></a> The difficulty in apprehending this great truth lies in not distinguishing the two.<a name=100:13></a> He lives in me for heaven as well as for earth; but He is the corn of the land in the one and the manna in the other.<a name=100:14></a>

		The sad part to me is that with the increase of knowledge there is less conformity to Christ, and well I know that no one's power, no matter how clear and beautiful he may be as to interpretation, is beyond the effect of the word in himself.<a name=109:11></a> The sure indication of declension in every age has been the acceptance of the word of God without moral correspondence to it, and this is working at this present time.<a name=109:12></a>

		In the Old Testament He is dealing with man as man is, feeble and hindered by the intervention of any difficulty or power stopping his way, at one time no water to drink, at another time too much of it.<a name=110:8></a> Satan is not so much seen, but it is more all creation and man ostensibly hindering and balking any one who is faithful to God on the earth, and God shewing His people that He is above circumstances for their support; the way in which He does this is most interesting, and not only that, but it also discloses to us His own nature, so that as we apprehend the record by the Spirit we grow in the knowledge and understanding of Him.<a name=110:9></a>

		I was thinking this morning that there are two great processes always going on in a Christian, the object being to get morally clear of the old man and to bring in the new man, Christ Jesus.<a name=131:4></a> One process is "Beholding the glory of the Lord", bringing you into moral correspondence with Him.<a name=131:5></a> The second is a very different action -- "always bearing about in the body the dying of Jesus", the life of Jesus manifest in our mortal body.<a name=131:6></a> You might have the first in private contemplation, but the second -- the bearing about the dying of Jesus -- would transpire in every movement of your life; on the one hand you <i>receive of Christ</i>, and on the other you <i>part with</i> what is not of Him.<a name=131:7></a>

		I have been greatly interested, and I hope helped, by seeing the imperfect way we learn truth; not that the truth is imperfect, but we have learned it imperfectly.<a name=146:1></a> Some of us have been more occupied with seeing that we get the truth accurately, as revealed in the word of God, than we have been with understanding the state that is necessary in ourselves to our apprehension of what is revealed.<a name=146:2></a> Many have been satisfied with seeing the purpose of God's grace, but I find that there is a great deal more said about the state that is to enable us to receive it.<a name=146:3></a> For instance, in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>the prayer that you may be given the Spirit of wisdom and revelation is before you have received the truth; that is, that you must have got the mind of God in its breadth, before you can understand the mind of God.<a name=146:4></a> We have been too much satisfied with clear exposition of truth, and have contented ourselves with thinking that we had the truth because we had the exposition of it, instead of seeing that we require a divine state to enable us to apprehend the truth.<a name=146:5></a> This is most important as shewing how necessary the subjective is for the apprehension of the objective.<a name=146:6></a> Generally the former has been put after the latter, but if we study the ways of God, we shall find that He prepares us for the truth by giving us a state which can appreciate the truth before He enunciates the truth to us.<a name=146:7></a> We have thought everything of getting a clear idea of truth, whereas getting a state that can appreciate the truth is the great grace of God.<a name=146:8></a>

		I have only one suggestion to make to you, and that is, that you not only follow Him in heart adoringly for His wonderful service and interest in you down here, but that each of you study to know something of "beholding His glory" -- not so much what you say to Him as what He is to you; not so much your prayers as the sense of being lost in the blessedness of being near Him, outside this world; and this you will find will have a greater effect on you than even His hearing your prayers.<a name=159:7></a>

		I wish to direct your attention to the beginning of God's grace, and to the finish.<a name=166:2></a> It is clear if we do not know the beginning, we can never arrive at the finish.<a name=166:3></a> It is in the beginning that most Christians are defective.<a name=166:4></a> It is an old saying, 'The beginning is half the battle.<a name=166:5></a>' The Galatians did begin well, but they were hindered, and they had to begin in a deeper and fuller way.<a name=166:6></a> The beginning of God's grace is that He has laid help upon One that is mighty -- His own arm has brought salvation.<a name=166:7></a> Now while every Christian will accept this in words, not many enter into how it was effectuated.<a name=166:8></a> God's Son became a Man, that He might bear the judgment that rested on Adam and his race, and remove that man in judgment from the eye of God; and He so glorified God in this, that He was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, and in Him the believer is accepted by God, so that the first man might be altogether removed from His eye for the believer, and he is in Christ; no longer in Adam, but in Christ: the believer can say "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:2">Romans  8:2</a>).<a name=166:9></a> Now this is the beginning; hence when Christ is formed in you, you know that your old man is crucified, and you can say "I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:20">Galatians  2:20</a>).<a name=166:10></a> It is not merely that the man who offended is gone from the eye of God, but experimentally he is gone from you because you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit.<a name=166:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the finish is, that while in the counsel of God every believer is united to Christ, the Spirit's present work in him is to conduct him in spirit now to where Christ is, as Rebekah was conducted to Isaac, in order that he may realise union with Christ in heaven; and from thence he comes forth with heavenly power as a new man on the earth, in the church, and in the natural relations in which God has placed him, so that he is able to stand for Christ here against all the power of the enemy.<a name=166:12></a>

		I think the work of the gospel is too solemn to be treated in the levity of eloquence.<a name=209:17></a> Every one knows that human eloquence can work a man up to a desired conclusion.<a name=209:18></a> It has often been practised; even Christians are greatly moved by an eloquent discourse; they are excited and pleased; whereas when it is purely spiritual, when heart and conscience are touched, they are subdued and solemnised; they have to do with God.<a name=209:19></a> The human mind cannot go beyond the human mind; you may get an assent from many without any real work of God.<a name=209:20></a> When you address the mind you get a mental assent to the truth, but when you have touched the conscience you have brought God in.<a name=209:21></a> When a servant is in the power of the truth he does not address the old man, for he knows that the old man can have nothing to do with the grace of God.<a name=209:22></a> As a simple man once said to an eloquent preacher, 'You began by telling us that the old man must have no

	<div class="paragraph">
		Dear Brethren, -- Though I am not able to be among you, my heart is fully with you, and I have you in remembrance before the Lord, I am thankful to say, daily.<a name=247:15></a> I may just briefly express great desire for you.<a name=247:16></a> We are delivered out of Egypt -- the world -- what man has made of the earth, to be in God's habitation.<a name=247:17></a> "Thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15:13">Exodus  15:13</a>).<a name=247:18></a> Now if this is definitely before you, even that you have been delivered out of the present evil age for heaven, you must take the only true road to reach it.<a name=247:19></a> The divine path to heaven is through the wilderness.<a name=247:20></a> This world is a wilderness, and there is nothing for you here

		but Marah, that is, death on man's side; and the more you have fellowship with Christ in His death, the easier the path becomes to you, because you see the true character of this world; and the more truly you do, the more you seek Him where He is.<a name=248:1></a> "That .<a name=248:2></a>.<a name=248:3></a>.<a name=248:4></a> we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us: which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#6:18">Hebrews  6:18</a>, 19).<a name=248:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, if you are diverted from His place -- where Jesus is entered as Forerunner, by anything here, even the mercies of God, you have lost the anchor of your soul, and you drop into the world; but if you cleave to Him, and to His place, you learn, as in Colossians, that heaven is the hope of the gospel (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:5">Colossians  1:5</a> - 23).<a name=248:6></a> You will find that it is God's grace to you that you should be morally dead to everything here, though fulfilling all the ordinances of God, and you are in living enjoyment of the things above, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God.<a name=248:7></a> No one can conceive a more wonderful position as set here on the earth for Christ.<a name=248:8></a> The Lord incline each of our hearts more and more to follow Him there for present enjoyment.<a name=248:9></a>

		Though I was pretty comfortable last night I could not go to sleep, and I was pleased at getting a title for my paper, namely, there must be heresies among you.<a name=249:20></a> I think the force of that is that something hinders them from adopting the truth in its fulness, and they set up an opinion of their own.<a name=249:21></a> In the case of Christendom it is one huge system of heresies; for example, they have no idea of the removal of the first man and they limit the Lord's supper to the remembrance of your own benefit.<a name=249:22></a> When a man qualifies the truth it is because it is too much for him, not because he intends to be wrong.<a name=249:23></a> Lot looking for a place for himself instead of following Abraham is an example of it.<a name=249:24></a>.<a name=249:25></a>.<a name=249:26></a>.<a name=249:27></a>
