	<div class="paragraph">
		The subject I desire to occupy you with this evening is <i>Salvation</i> .<a name=1:1></a> The word is much misused, for it is looked at generally as only what I am saved <i>from</i> , while in Scripture it is also what I am saved <i>to</i> .<a name=1:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is interesting to observe how the word 'salvation' is used.<a name=1:3></a> In Ephesians, we have "the gospel of your salvation" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:13">Ephesians  1:13</a>); in Hebrews, "the captain of our salvation" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:10">Hebrews  2:10</a>); in Philippians, "Work out your own salvation".<a name=1:4></a> (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:12">Philippians  2:12</a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a great difference between being occupied with what you are saved <i>from</i> , and what you are saved <i>to</i> .<a name=1:5></a> If you are occupied with the first, it is only relief that is before you; if with the second, you are occupied with the hope of the gospel.<a name=1:6></a> Our blessed Lord was not satisfied with getting us out of misery, but He obtained the Father's house for us.<a name=1:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I turn to <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#5:8">1 Thessalonians  5:8</a> - 10: "But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.<a name=1:8></a> For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him".<a name=1:9></a> Mark verse 10; I beg you to bear that especially in your hearts.<a name=1:10></a> What a comprehensive verse it is!<a name=1:11></a> "Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him".<a name=1:12></a> He died that we might be with Him.<a name=1:13></a> How that touches the heart!<a name=1:14></a> And the word 'with' here is remarkable; it means co-partnership, association.<a name=1:15></a> Well, that is most cheering, that whether I watch or sleep, I am to live <i>with</i>  Him.<a name=1:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Now is our <i>salvation</i>  nearer than when we believed".<a name=1:17></a> (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#13:11">Romans  13:11</a>) I ask, do you know what this salvation is?<a name=1:18></a> The first thing is that the work is completed, not

		merely to get me out of misery and judgement, but to place me in glory.<a name=2:1></a> That is the reason I have read about the thief on the cross.<a name=2:2></a> Directly his eyes are opened, and he sees the just One suffering for the unjust, he says, "Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom".<a name=2:3></a> He saw Jesus as King; the Lord says to him, "Verily, I say unto thee, To-day shalt thou be with me in Paradise".<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Commentators have tried to put a comma after "today", to make out that it did not happen then; but it did happen then; at that moment Paradise was opened, and it was not the Paradise of man, but the Paradise of God.<a name=2:5></a> The flaming sword and the cherubim guarded the Paradise of man.<a name=2:6></a> This was far more.<a name=2:7></a> It is the Lord's place.<a name=2:8></a> The Lord says to him, "To-day shalt thou be with me in Paradise".<a name=2:9></a> The effect of Christ's work was to transfer that man from the deepest misery to the greatest happiness.<a name=2:10></a> See what he was transferred <i>from</i> , and what <i>to</i> !<a name=2:11></a> By the efficacy of the death of Christ, that man passed from the lowest, deepest, darkest place of misery ever known to man, into the brightest, holiest, most blessed place of ineffable bliss with the Lord.<a name=2:12></a> That is the transition.<a name=2:13></a> That is what Christ has done.<a name=2:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I must digress a little.<a name=2:15></a> There are two great spheres of blessing obtained for us; they combine in the Father's house.<a name=2:16></a> Both were procured by the death of Christ: in type they are -- Canaan, and while on the road to Canaan, the tabernacle.<a name=2:17></a> These two now converge.<a name=2:18></a> We are in the presence of God, and approach Him in all the acceptance of Christ; that is, the tabernacle; and we are seated in the heavenlies in Him, that is Canaan.<a name=2:19></a> They had in the tabernacle a travelling companion in the wilderness; we, too, have the presence of God with us, we approach Him now in all the acceptance of Christ; we have the true tabernacle in the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has passed into "heaven itself, now to appear in

		the presence of God for us".<a name=3:1></a> (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9:24">Hebrews  9:24</a>) I have entrance into the holiest of all by the blood of Jesus, and I get there in all the perfection of the One who brought me there.<a name=3:2></a> The other sphere of blessing is Canaan -- heaven -- that is, in the very brightest place.<a name=3:3></a> I am "seated in the heavenlies in Christ".<a name=3:4></a> "Accepted in the beloved".<a name=3:5></a> These two -- the greatest blessings -- converge in the Father's house, and both are obtained by the death of Christ.<a name=3:6></a> Both of them are obtained, and secured to me by His death.<a name=3:7></a> "He died that, whether we watch or sleep, we should live together with him".<a name=3:8></a> (<a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#5:10">1 Thessalonians  5:10</a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I look at it now from another side.<a name=3:9></a> Every saint looks for escape, expecting to go to heaven by-and-by; but there is another thing, approach to God now; that is unknown to Christians in general; it is not only that I am going to heaven, but I have approach to God now, known along the road: that is Hebrews.<a name=3:10></a> I have right to enter the holiest of all, where all is suited to the holiness and righteousness of God, a scene of spotless purity and light.<a name=3:11></a> I can rejoice <i>now</i>  in all this blessedness while on the way to heaven.<a name=3:12></a> I have entrance now into the holiest; and, besides, we are now <i>seated</i>  in the heavenlies in Christ.<a name=3:13></a> In <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#23">Luke  23</a>is established the great fact, that by the death of Christ you pass from the deepest darkness to the brightest place.<a name=3:14></a> People cavil at it, they say the thief died; very well, but <i>his</i>  death did not entitle him to enter Paradise.<a name=3:15></a> It was Christ's death that obtained it for him.<a name=3:16></a> There are four aspects of the death of Christ from Egypt to Canaan.<a name=3:17></a>

		These are the four aspects of the death of Christ; they all happened together, but I do not say I learn them together.<a name=4:1></a> The Holy Spirit comes down to make known to my heart what Christ has done.<a name=4:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The thief on the cross entered into Paradise, and his own death had divested him of the encumbrance of the old man in a moment.<a name=4:3></a> We are not free of the encumbrance as he was; he was free because he died.<a name=4:4></a> So the apostle says, "Though the outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day".<a name=4:5></a> (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:16">2 Corinthians  4:16</a>) Look at a saint dying and going to heaven; he gets brighter and brighter because the encumbrance is getting weaker.<a name=4:6></a> I say the thief went to Paradise, and that he was free from encumbrance, because he could not carry a bit of the old man into that place.<a name=4:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I turn to Corinthians, to show you a man in Christ free from encumbrance, who had <i>not</i>  died.<a name=4:8></a> Christ's work entitles a man on the earth to enjoy <i>this</i> .<a name=4:9></a> Paul does not say an apostle, but "a man in Christ", who had no sense of encumbrance.<a name=4:10></a> The Holy Spirit from the glorified Christ led him up there to show him what the work of Christ had accomplished.<a name=4:11></a> I believe this man in Christ is in a greater position than the thief in Paradise.<a name=4:12></a> It shows the possibility of being taken into Paradise; and more than this, it shows also the <i>nature</i>  of the reception vouchsafed there.<a name=4:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Of the thief on the cross we know that he died, and that from the lowest place he went to Paradise, but here, without getting rid of the encumbrance on this earth, the apostle was taken at once into the very highest place, received in the most cordial way, and treated most intimately.<a name=4:14></a> Often by favour people get into high places, but the question is, How are they received there?<a name=4:15></a> How was this man received?<a name=4:16></a> Nothing can convey the cordiality of his reception!<a name=4:17></a> He could tell no man about it.<a name=4:18></a> Here was a man walking about this world with the secrets of God in his heart which he could not disclose to anyone.<a name=4:19></a>

		We have heard of the man who dreamed that he went to a great palace, and was received well at the door; then he went in, and at each successive room he was better received.<a name=5:1></a> At last he entered the <i>presence</i>  chamber, and there he was received with acclamation.<a name=5:2></a> It is more than that with the man in Christ!<a name=5:3></a>

		The prodigal son entering the Father's house shows out the nature of our salvation.<a name=5:4></a> It is not simply for my benefit that I am there, but God has a delight in having me there.<a name=5:5></a> The Lord here was working out the will of the Father; He says, "I have meat to eat that ye know not of" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#4:32">John  4:32</a>) "My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work".<a name=5:6></a> (<a href="../bible/John.htm#4:34">John  4:34</a>) We see in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15">Luke  15</a>the delight of the Father in the reception of the prodigal.<a name=5:7></a> "It was meet that we should make merry and be glad".<a name=5:8></a> (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15:32">Luke  15:32</a>) Love delights to have me in its company.<a name=5:9></a> If man's need were the measure of Christ's work, human joys would suffice; but, when divine love is the measure, the Father's house and the joys there are alone sufficient.<a name=5:10></a> It is the Father's pleasure that His house should be filled, therefore "It was meet that we should make merry and be glad".<a name=5:11></a> "This my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found".<a name=5:12></a> (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15:24">Luke  15:24</a>) That is why the reception of the man in Christ was so cordial and so full.<a name=5:13></a> This is the characteristic, not of the apostle, but of the man in Christ.<a name=5:14></a> Every believer now has a home there.<a name=5:15></a> I am dwelling on the gain which we derive from being occupied with the finish; what we are saved <i>to</i> .<a name=5:16></a>

		Do you accept that this is the main point?<a name=5:17></a> It is not like the man in the dream; he made good his footing as he went in; but in the gospel, the light that first comes to you is the light of the end, it is "the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ".<a name=5:18></a> The light comes from the finish, though it begins with you where you are, and conducts you to the finish.<a name=5:19></a> As you advance it becomes fuller and fuller, like the path of the just, that shineth more and more unto the

	<div class="paragraph">
		I turn now to Luke.<a name=6:4></a> Luke's gospel shows that you are not saved for earth, but saved for heaven.<a name=6:5></a> From whence, then, do you get your joys?<a name=6:6></a> From heaven!<a name=6:7></a> "Who died .<a name=6:8></a>.<a name=6:9></a> .<a name=6:10></a> that we should live together with him".<a name=6:11></a> (<a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#5:10">1 Thessalonians  5:10</a>) That is the end, the proper hope of the Christian; and you are actually deriving your present enjoyments from that end.<a name=6:12></a> Many Christians are not happy.<a name=6:13></a> Why?<a name=6:14></a> Because they are not deriving their joys from the place where the joys never end; as Peter says, "Joy unspeakable, and full of glory".<a name=6:15></a> (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:8">1 Peter  1:8</a>)

		In chapter 14 is the great supper; it is not in the land, but in the Father's house.<a name=6:16></a> The prodigal is conducted to the Father's house; he is not restored to the land.<a name=6:17></a> That was lost, but he gets a greater thing, the Father's house, and finds joys that can never end.<a name=6:18></a> The natural man connects joy with temporal things; even Christians are often disappointed, because they look for joys in the wrong place.<a name=6:19></a> The feast is Wisdom's feast, and that is in the Father's house.<a name=6:20></a> How wonderful the present enjoyment that I derive from that which has been obtained for me by the death of Christ!<a name=6:21></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have salvation as a secured thing by the death of Christ.<a name=6:22></a> I have heaven, I am not there yet, but the efficacy of Christ's work has placed me in two great blessings -- the presence of God, and the joys that come from heaven -- as in the case of the prodigal, "They began to be merry", (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15:24">Luke  15:24</a>) and that joy will never cease.<a name=6:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I turn now to <a href="../bible/John.htm#7:37">John  7:37</a>.<a name=6:24></a> Well, beloved friends, what I learn here is, not what I am saved <i>from</i> , but what I am saved <i>to</i> ; I am in the reality of the fact that I am outside of death in His life, and not only in His life, but in <i>His power</i> , too, here in this scene of death!<a name=6:25></a> The Holy Spirit had come down from the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let me explain.<a name=7:5></a> There were for Israel three feasts in the year: the Passover, the feast of Pentecost, and the feast of Tabernacles.<a name=7:6></a> The first is the death of Christ, the second is the descent of the Holy Spirit, the third is not yet fulfilled: it will be in the millennium.<a name=7:7></a> Do you say, Then the millennial saints are better off than we are?<a name=7:8></a> No!<a name=7:9></a> For the presence and power of the Holy Spirit make us rejoice more than if we had the feast of Tabernacles.<a name=7:10></a> He is here to enrich our hearts with Christ.<a name=7:11></a> He has come down to make known to us all the joys of the Father's house.<a name=7:12></a> That is the great supper!<a name=7:13></a> I am not there yet, but I get my joys from there.<a name=7:14></a> I get home comforts, before I get home; my income is derived from there.<a name=7:15></a> There is no such thing as an earthly people now; we are a heavenly people, with heavenly joys.<a name=7:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I now recapitulate.<a name=7:17></a> First, Christ has accomplished our salvation, this great blessedness He has obtained for us, and we know it now.<a name=7:18></a> Secondly, in His life we are outside of death, and while passing through this evil world, we are superior to it through His power; the Holy Spirit sent down from our glorified Saviour, at one and the same time making us superior to the power of evil, and filling our hearts with joy; the joys of heaven to which we belong.<a name=7:19></a>

		Last week we were speaking of Salvation; not only what we are saved from, but what we are saved to.<a name=8:1></a> And what you find is, that the Spirit of God occupies us now with what we are saved to.<a name=8:2></a> If you are only occupied with what you are saved from, it is relief that is before you.<a name=8:3></a> But if you are occupied with what you are saved to, you are abounding in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=8:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two sides to Christ's work which we often find separated.<a name=8:5></a> One is the sinner's benefit.<a name=8:6></a> Thank God, that, in a great measure, is proclaimed fully.<a name=8:7></a> But there is another side that is not so fully proclaimed, and that is the delight of the Father in having us in His company.<a name=8:8></a> Christ accomplished both; for He had not only to bear the judgement of our sins in order that our benefit might be secured, but He had to effect that which would satisfy the Father's heart, so that we could be in His company: like the prodigal son, who was brought home to the Father's house.<a name=8:9></a> The subject in that parable is not the benefit of the one found, but the delight of the finder.<a name=8:10></a> You must connect the two sides in the gospel.<a name=8:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As I pointed out last week, the parable of the great supper (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#14">Luke  14</a>), shows God's side; while that of the good Samaritan in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10">Luke  10</a>shows our side.<a name=8:12></a> It sets forth how the Lord fully secured our benefit for evermore.<a name=8:13></a>

		Now for the point that I wish specially to bring before you this evening.<a name=9:1></a> The thief on the cross went straight to heaven, there to be with the Lord.<a name=9:2></a> He was free from all encumbrance.<a name=9:3></a> Mark the fact, that his salvation is accomplished and enjoyed by him.<a name=9:4></a> But one will say, O, but he died!<a name=9:5></a> Well, I admit it; and that free from all encumbrance, he went to Paradise; but it was Christ's work, not his own death, which obtained it for him.<a name=9:6></a> Hence there is a greater thing now, which is illustrated by Paul being caught up into the third heaven.<a name=9:7></a> The Spirit in relating it, does not say Paul; He says, "a man in Christ" on one occasion was caught up into Paradise, before he died, but free from any sense of encumbrance!<a name=9:8></a> By the Spirit of God, he was carried up to the highest spot and meets with a most wonderful reception, for in great confidence and intimacy, he hears the counsels of God.<a name=9:9></a> He has not only reached the highest place, but he is received there on the most intimate terms, as "accepted in the Beloved".<a name=9:10></a> (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:6">Ephesians  1:6</a>) Verily he is there in perfect liberty, with no sense of encumbrance.<a name=9:11></a> And that is the point I want to bring before you this evening: that it is possible for us to enjoy, as our present portion, what Christ's work has secured for us; to have the sense of it without encumbrance, as made "free from the law of sin and death".<a name=9:12></a> (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:2">Romans  8:2</a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The thief died, he was divested of everything; Paul, a man in Christ, was caught up into Paradise, and was received there in the most cordial way possible; he had no sense of encumbrance.<a name=9:13></a> This is a sample of a greater thing.<a name=9:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Holy Spirit has come down from the glorified Christ, and leads our hearts into the enjoyment of that scene in which He is, a scene of perfect brightness which he has obtained for us; and though we are still encompassed with this body of death, yet we can really know what liberty is, liberty in Christ's life.<a name=9:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This, beloved friends, is what I wish to dwell a
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=10>[Page 10]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		little upon; it is a subject of all importance.<a name=10:1></a> Earnest souls have at all times endeavoured to reach this liberty, that is, to get rid of the encumbrance, to walk about in this world free from that which is the encumbrance, that is, the old man, the flesh.<a name=10:2></a> Hence, you see the apostle states his own practical knowledge.<a name=10:3></a> It is not simply what we call knowing the truth doctrinally, but he states it is a known fact.<a name=10:4></a> "I am crucified with Christ; nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me, and the life that I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me".<a name=10:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, now, what I desire to occupy you with is how this is practically known, how you can really arrive at it.<a name=10:6></a> The first thing is, that the old man has, in the eye of God, been ended judicially on the cross.<a name=10:7></a> I am not speaking now of experience.<a name=10:8></a> But the first great point is, that man, the responsible man, must be judicially removed from the eye of God.<a name=10:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Look at the beginning.<a name=10:10></a> Man was driven out from the garden of Eden; there was the flaming sword that turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.<a name=10:11></a> He is a responsible man under judgement; unless he fulfils what is required, he cannot get back.<a name=10:12></a> He cannot regain, when guilty and under the judgement of death, what he did not retain in innocence.<a name=10:13></a> When he failed in innocence, how could he get back when under condemnation?<a name=10:14></a> But we find that instead of man getting better after being driven out, he goes from bad to worse.<a name=10:15></a> Hence that man must judicially terminate in the sight of God; that is, that as man cannot meet his responsibility, he must bear the judgement of God.<a name=10:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mark the fact: man did not get better; on the contrary, after 1,500 years I read in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#6:13">Genesis  6:13</a>: "And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them: and behold I will destroy them with the earth".<a name=10:17></a>

		In the Septuagint (a Greek version of the Old Testament, a version of the scripture that the apostles continually quote from, just as I might quote from the English version now) -- in the Septuagint it is, "The time of all men is come".<a name=11:1></a> "The time", that is, a period: we get the word constantly, "time" and "times"; it is a period of existence now completed.<a name=11:2></a> I dwell upon this, because it shows that the wickedness of man was fully exposed; "The end of all flesh is come before me".<a name=11:3></a>

		When I come to Romans (though I am not going to dwell upon it now), I get three things spoken of, which indicate what the state of man in the flesh is.<a name=11:4></a> We get the blood of Christ, the death of Christ, and the crucifixion of Christ.<a name=11:5></a> All occurred together, but they are different aspects of the same act.<a name=11:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I want you to understand, not only that Christ has atoned for our sins, "He bare our sins in his own body on the tree"; (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:24">1 Peter  2:24</a>) but, beloved friends, that He bare the judgement due to <i>us</i> , and <i>we</i>  judicially have come to an end in God's sight; "He, who knew no sin, was made sin for us that we might be made the righteousness of God in him".<a name=11:7></a> (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:21">2 Corinthians  5:21</a>) Hence, in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:6">Romans  6:6</a>, we read, "Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin".<a name=11:8></a> Here, as has been often remarked, it is "sin", not "sins" -- "that the body of sin might be destroyed".<a name=11:9></a>

		Man, as the responsible man, has failed; it could not be otherwise; and he is under the judgement of God.<a name=11:10></a> If he bore the judgement himself, it would be the end of him, in misery for ever.<a name=11:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, who will bear the judgement for him?<a name=11:12></a> The Lord Jesus Christ has come, become a man, apart entirely from sin; He knew no sin, or He could not be the sacrifice for it.<a name=11:13></a> He is the Aaron in the day of atonement: He went in with His own blood into the holiest of all, but also He suffered without the gate.<a name=11:14></a>

		Mark now the importance of this; we know what exercises souls go through.<a name=12:4></a> A person says, All my sins are forgiven me, but I am sinning every minute, and if I am not sinning, I have an inclination to sin.<a name=12:5></a> Well, that soul has not liberty, he is not "free from the law of sin and death".<a name=12:6></a> (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:2">Romans  8:2</a>) I am not speaking of forgiveness tonight, I am speaking of liberty.<a name=12:7></a> O, you say, but we are never out of the body.<a name=12:8></a> True; we are never out of the body, but still the great thing is, to find liberty of soul in freedom from the power of the flesh.<a name=12:9></a>

		Now the first point is, that the responsible man must undergo the judgement of death.<a name=12:10></a> You could not have the responsible man existing if he bore the judgement.<a name=12:11></a> How could he exist if he bore the judgement.<a name=12:12></a> And if that judgement is borne for him by another, is he to exist?<a name=12:13></a> It could not be!<a name=12:14></a> People talk of a recruit being taken in place of another man who is pressed for the army, and he dies for him, as if that were an illustration of what we are speaking of; but that is not the truth at all, that is allowing the responsible man to live, whereas the truth is, that I am free from the responsibility of the responsible man, through Christ bearing the judgement.<a name=12:15></a> I am not, through Christ, that man now; that man cannot continue; if I really believe that I have died with Him, I am in liberty in His life, for He lives.<a name=12:16></a>

		Well now, turn to <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21">Numbers  21</a>, and you will see how this comes out practically.<a name=15:4></a> In that chapter you have the brazen serpent.<a name=15:5></a> I referred to that last week, so I will only recall it to your attention now.<a name=15:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There were four aspects of the death of Christ.<a name=15:7></a> They all happened together; I do not say that I learn them all together, but they happened together.<a name=15:8></a> There was the blood upon the lintel, there was the Red Sea, there was the brazen serpent, and there was the Jordan.<a name=15:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The brazen serpent was when they were leaving the wilderness.<a name=15:10></a> Then the real character of the flesh came out.<a name=15:11></a> After thirty-nine years in the wilderness, and recipients daily of the utmost care of God, they spake against God and against Moses, and God sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people; they are turned back to the very first entrance of sin, of the old serpent, the devil, in the garden of Eden; the virus of sin was there.<a name=15:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And now God tells Moses to make a brazen serpent that never did a bit of the wrong, but was in the likeness of the serpent; and this serpent he was to put upon a pole, outside of man and above the earth, and it came to pass that if any one was bitten, if he had a sense of what the bitterness of sin was, he looked and he lived; that is, in the life he got by looking at the one who was where sin was condemned, there he had liberty.<a name=15:13></a> He had liberty because of being in a life outside himself; and this was the result of faith.<a name=15:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now if you turn to <a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>, You will see that is where John's teaching begins.<a name=15:15></a> He does not begin with the blood upon the lintel, nor with the Red Sea; no, he begins where they had started upon a new

		journey, "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man"- who is the antitype to the serpent -- "be lifted up"; and we can say that the Son of man must be lifted up -- for what?<a name=16:1></a> To bear the judgement for me!<a name=16:2></a> "God, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh".<a name=16:3></a> And now, what then?<a name=16:4></a> I believe, I look up, and I see I shall not come into judgement, but am passed from death unto life.<a name=16:5></a> I have the life of the One who bore the judgement.<a name=16:6></a> And that is the argument in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>, which I must revert to now.<a name=16:7></a> Paul says, "If we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him".<a name=16:8></a> What gives me relief?<a name=16:9></a> I believe that I am dead with Him; I am not dead at all <i>myself</i> , for I find sin springing up, but I say, "I am dead <i>with Christ</i>".<a name=16:10></a> And I am in His life; I have the life of the One with whom I died.<a name=16:11></a> It is really the simplest thing in the world, if you look at it as Scripture does, that I have the life of the One with whom I died.<a name=16:12></a> If you were dead yourself, you could not be alive.<a name=16:13></a> But you are dead with Christ, and there is nothing against you, because "he that is dead is freed from sin".<a name=16:14></a>

		But more, I have life now, I have life in the One with whom I died; and that is where I have it, and nowhere else.<a name=16:15></a> Therefore the apostle says, "I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me".<a name=16:16></a> That is the second step.<a name=16:17></a> It is not that I am better than I was; but I have the life of Christ with whom I have died.<a name=16:18></a> I see now that I am dead with Christ, and that as I accept the fact that I am dead with Him, I am in His life.<a name=16:19></a> And hence in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21">Numbers  21</a>, there was also the "well of God".<a name=16:20></a> "Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst, but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up unto everlasting life".<a name=16:21></a> That is, the Holy Spirit in me gives me the enjoyment of that new life which I have now

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, that is what I call the second step; but there is another -- the practical one -- to which I must turn now; but before I do so, I digress a little, to point out the different ways that people try to arrive at this liberty.<a name=17:2></a> I need not go into all the phases, but there are four ways I should like to bring before you, by which conscientious, earnest souls have tried to arrive at the relief which can only be had when I am alive in Christ's life.<a name=17:3></a> Then I am free.<a name=17:4></a> "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free".<a name=17:5></a> It is not that I am forgiven merely, but I am free, I am at liberty.<a name=17:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It would be going too far to go into it now, but the same statement is made in Colossians, "If ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world"- that is Jordan.<a name=17:7></a> In Colossians you are not only dead to sin; that is Romans; but you are dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world; you are out of it.<a name=17:8></a> It is by the same means as in Romans, only extended.<a name=17:9></a> If you are dead with Him, you are free from yourself, "Yet not I, but Christ liveth in me".<a name=17:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, now I must turn to four different ways in which people have thought to arrive at this liberty, and I think I have traversed them all myself.<a name=17:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first is that you think by a certain monastic course you will be able to control the flesh.<a name=17:12></a> I never thought that any self-denial I adopted would atone for my sins.<a name=17:13></a> But I thought I could control the flesh.<a name=17:14></a> I dare say you all know something of that.<a name=17:15></a> That is very often in connection with a state where there is not a clear apprehension of the full work of Christ; that is, that the whole thing is gone from the eye of God, so that He does not impute sin.<a name=17:16></a> Unless a soul gets so far clear, he will not be safe from the snare of "bodily exercise".<a name=17:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=18>[Page 18]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second is what is called 'holiness by faith'.<a name=18:1></a> That is extremely specious.<a name=18:2></a> The thought is to bring oneself up to a certain standard of holiness.<a name=18:3></a> a holiness which does not offend against the law.<a name=18:4></a> Such hold that there is no sin but in transgression.<a name=18:5></a> That is the holiness of the law, it is not the holiness of God.<a name=18:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		They argue that we are dead by faith, and that if we can be without sin for one minute, why not for two?<a name=18:7></a> and if two, why not for four?<a name=18:8></a> And so they go on, adding on, and say that because you have faith you are a dead man.<a name=18:9></a> But you are not a dead man; you are dead with Christ, but you are alive; and you find out very quickly, too, that you are not dead: but you are "free from the law of sin and death" in Christ's life.<a name=18:10></a> It is not that you are dead, but being dead with Christ, you live in another life.<a name=18:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The great mistake at the bottom of 'holiness by faith' is, that what holiness really is, is not understood; the presence of God in the holiest has never been known.<a name=18:12></a> There is no sense of separation from everything unholy, no separation from the systems of religion in Christendom; no idea of the separate position of one called to God.<a name=18:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I come to the third way, which is called 'death to nature'.<a name=18:14></a> Death to nature is the snare into which one falls who seeks liberty, when he knows that he is called to a holy separate path, that he cannot take lower ground than that he must be free from the flesh; and therefore he is trying to get rid of it.<a name=18:15></a> The teaching therefore is, I am dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world; I belong to a sphere of life, and I live in it; I belong to that life now, and I am outside of this scene altogether; I am out of death and in that new scene.<a name=18:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, but if you accept all this, come back into this scene in the power of Christ, and then it will be manifested that you are in His life.<a name=18:17></a> Death to nature is one-sided -- an ideality.<a name=18:18></a> Death to nature assumes

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is what you get in Ephesians.<a name=19:3></a> I face it all I never swerve, but own what is due to the Lord, overcoming evil with good, the greatest moral victory that ever can be upon this earth.<a name=19:4></a> But you must connect the two, and if you combine them you will be greatly blessed.<a name=19:5></a> I am out of death into life: outside of it all, yet in it all, but above it.<a name=19:6></a> That is true liberty, as the apostle says, "The life that I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me".<a name=19:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The fourth, and most novel, is assuming that you can have power over sin by applying the death of Christ; a curious perversion of being dead with Him.<a name=19:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I must turn for a moment to what I call the practical side (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4">Galatians  4</a>), a subject of immense interest and very great scope.<a name=19:9></a> And what I find, is -- you may think I am severe in making the remark, but I do not feel that I am so -- I do not believe any person progresses till he has got hold of this liberty.<a name=19:10></a> He may be very conscientious and very devoted, too, but devotedness is not progress properly in itself.<a name=19:11></a> A devoted person wishes to progress, but when he is not free from the thraldom of the flesh there is a terrible block in his way.<a name=19:12></a>

		This chapter 4 teaches us how Ishmael, one born after the flesh, is cast out -- treated as an intruder.<a name=20:4></a> Time would fail me now to bring before you fully what is extremely interesting in itself -- even that there are three great intrusions of the flesh.<a name=20:5></a> I will just touch upon them.<a name=20:6></a> There is the Corinthian intrusion, which is self-indulgence; one is beguiled into that, when he thinks he is wise enough to govern himself.<a name=20:7></a> What the apostle brings forward to meet this is, "I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ and him crucified".<a name=20:8></a> The old man is gone.<a name=20:9></a> If at the Lord's supper you call to mind Christ's death on your account, how could you indulge the man for whom He died?<a name=20:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Galatian intrusion is another.<a name=20:11></a> They sought to be made perfect by the flesh.<a name=20:12></a> That is legalism, and in a certain sense, the opposite to that of the Corinthians.<a name=20:13></a>

		What is brought before us in this chapter is related in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#21">Genesis  21</a>, that Abraham, when Isaac was weaned, made a great feast, and when this feast was made, Ishmael, who was at that time fourteen years of age, mocked, no doubt ridiculed the idea that this little

	<div class="paragraph">
		Isaac's place was acknowledged in Abraham's house on that day, and this drew forth the reviling of Ishmael, which the apostle calls persecution.<a name=21:2></a> "As then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now".<a name=21:3></a> But how do we enjoy this practically?<a name=21:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is an extremely important and interesting question for us.<a name=21:5></a> We first find how bad Ishmael is; the incompetence of the flesh as in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>, but concurrently with it, the enjoyment of what Christ is.<a name=21:6></a> When did persecution, as Paul calls it, when did the scoffing of Ishmael come out?<a name=21:7></a> When Isaac gets his place.<a name=21:8></a> It was a festive day, and I dare say many could look back historically to when this festive day was known to their souls.<a name=21:9></a> When did you get a sense in your hearts that you wanted to be so entirely free from the flesh, that you felt you would not tolerate it any longer -- not merely as to doctrine, but that you could not tolerate it?<a name=21:10></a> When did you arrive at that day when you felt it was not to be tolerated practically?<a name=21:11></a> When you learned that the flesh was opposed to Christ, and at the same time that He was possessor of your whole heart, so that you felt the flesh had no right to be there; you do not tolerate it.<a name=21:12></a> Therefore the apostle says, "Not I, but Christ".<a name=21:13></a> I call this the coronation-day, that is, when Christ is crowned King of my heart.<a name=21:14></a> It is not that He has the first place there; that He always had through divine grace, but He has got every place, that is, I acknowledge His sway from centre to circumference.<a name=21:15></a> I have found out the flesh.<a name=21:16></a> What then?<a name=21:17></a> Ishmael must go out.<a name=21:18></a> Well, it is not a pleasant thing to accept that I am dead, and therefore God says to Abraham, "Let it not be grievous unto thee; cast out the bondwoman and her son".<a name=21:19></a> That is non-toleration; I accept what God has done with the flesh.<a name=21:20></a> Well, what then?<a name=21:21></a> <i>I am at liberty</i> .<a name=21:22></a>

		One may ask, Does the flesh never come again?<a name=22:1></a> It does, but you treat it now as an intruder; and you can say to it, You are an intruder, you have no right to come here; you are supplanted, and you have no place here.<a name=22:2></a> You may say, But Ishmael knows the house well; thrust out at the door, he can come in at a window.<a name=22:3></a> No doubt he does; he was fourteen years in it, and that is a long period.<a name=22:4></a> But then, I say, he has no right.<a name=22:5></a> I am crucified with Christ, that is the first thing.<a name=22:6></a> This would not suffice to keep him out, he knows how to master you too well.<a name=22:7></a> But also you have a new power.<a name=22:8></a> If you turn to chapter 5: 17, You will read, "The flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh, and these are contrary the one to the other, so that ye may not do the things that ye would".<a name=22:9></a> I have got the Spirit of God to maintain me free from the intruder, and He only preserves me from the flesh.<a name=22:10></a>

		APPROACH TO GOD
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:19">Hebrews  10:19</a> - 22
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The subject here is approach to God.<a name=24:1></a> Amongst all Christians there is the knowledge of escape from judgement.<a name=24:2></a> Escape from judgement is, as it were, the only thing pressed.<a name=24:3></a> I do not know that, as a rule, the doctrine of approach is much known.<a name=24:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You get an example of what I mean in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#17">Luke  17</a>.<a name=24:5></a> You will remember the ten lepers: they were all healed; they all escaped; but only one approached.<a name=24:6></a> You see, according to the type (<a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#14">Leviticus  14</a>), there was first the relieving of the leper -- an offering for his cleansing -- but afterwards he had to go through a very particular process before he could approach God.<a name=24:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, beloved friends, I would wish to interest your hearts very much in this truth, that there is not only escape, but also approach to God.<a name=24:8></a> It is truly a wonderful thing for us sinners to escape from judgement -- that is our side of the grace of God.<a name=24:9></a> But just think that the blessed God would like you to approach Him.<a name=24:10></a> Hence, when the one leper returned, the Lord says, "Were there not ten cleansed, but where are the nine?<a name=24:11></a> There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger".<a name=24:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, you naturally ask, what was the hindrance or difficulty?<a name=24:13></a> That I will speak of presently.<a name=24:14></a> But before I speak of the hindrance or the obstruction (and that includes the process), I would dwell upon our having the right to approach to God, for that is the first great thing to be assured of in the soul, and that is what we find in figure here.<a name=24:15></a> The Lord had so blessed the leper, that he was bound to return to Him.<a name=24:16></a> When he did return, he doubtless exemplified what we have to go through as we approach.<a name=24:17></a> He falls down on his face; that is the process; you cannot approach without that.<a name=24:18></a> You can get the knowledge that you are saved

		from judgement, without parting company with yourself, but you cannot approach without doing so.<a name=25:1></a> No flesh can glory in His presence.<a name=25:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing I will dwell upon now, after this preface, having, as I trust, interested you in the subject, is that the tabernacle discloses to us the delight that God has in having us in His own presence.<a name=25:3></a> If there had been no tabernacle, and Israel had only the land in prospect, their benefit and happiness would have been fully secured; but actually, on the road to Canaan, there was the tabernacle.<a name=25:4></a> And what you get in Hebrews is, that with us, it is not a tabernacle like the one Israel had, but the true tabernacle.<a name=25:5></a> It is not that I am brought up to it, but the sense of it is brought down to me, that I may know the delight that God has in having me in His presence.<a name=25:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, then, we have in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:19">Hebrews  10:19</a> the right to go in.<a name=25:7></a> We have "boldness", a very strong word, a word that is used for an emancipated slave; we have boldness to enter into the holiest.<a name=25:8></a> It is not escape merely; you might escape and yet never get there, like the nine lepers.<a name=25:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let me interest you in one thing more -- I have no doubt of the blessing of it -- it is not only that I have the right to approach into this light, but it is the nature of the reception I get from the Person who owns the place.<a name=25:10></a> When I use the word 'place', I mean the condition belonging to a place.<a name=25:11></a> "The holiest of all" does not in Hebrews mean merely a place, therefore I say, you are here now in the presence of God.<a name=25:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you follow out the type, the tabernacle was in the wilderness, down among them.<a name=25:13></a> Now the antitype is that we can enter into this blessing, its living reality, not in figure, but by the Spirit of God.<a name=25:14></a> Though I have not come to heaven yet, I have found approach to God in the holiest of all, beforehand.<a name=25:15></a> Oh!<a name=25:16></a> some may say, but when I read the Ephesians, I am seated in the heavenlies in Christ.<a name=25:17></a> True, but that only shows

	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not stay now to bring much scripture before you, but I will give you a note of it.<a name=26:16></a> You all remember <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#16">Leviticus  16</a>, the day of atonement.<a name=26:17></a> I will only allude to what occurred then.<a name=26:18></a> The blood was taken right in by the high priest, the blood of the bullock, and the blood of the goat.<a name=26:19></a> There were two bloods, the blood of two animals; and that was to show the twofold blessing of the two companies.<a name=26:20></a> There was the earthly company, and the heavenly company.<a name=26:21></a> What we have to do with is the heavenly company, that is, the company that is identified with the high priest.<a name=26:22></a> That is ourselves.<a name=26:23></a> Therefore it is in that aspect we are looked at in the Hebrews.<a name=26:24></a>

		OUR GREAT PRIEST
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#4:12">Hebrews  4:12</a> - 16
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The subject that I desire to bring before you, this evening, is the priesthood of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=37:1></a> The question of sins is first settled, as you find in the first chapter of Hebrews.<a name=37:2></a> In Hebrews we have the greatness of the priest; the greatness of the sanctuary; and the greatness of the offering.<a name=37:3></a> At the end of chapter 9 you get the testament in consequence of death.<a name=37:4></a> It would be of no value at all until the death of the testator.<a name=37:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"By one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified".<a name=37:6></a> "There is no more offering for sin".<a name=37:7></a> Now we have a great Priest over the house of God.<a name=37:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is little understood amongst Christians, that priesthood has to do with infirmities and not with sins.<a name=37:9></a> The question of sin must first be settled.<a name=37:10></a> In the opening of Hebrews it is, "Having purged our sins he sat down"; but in chapter 8, "We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens".<a name=37:11></a> In order to understand what priesthood is, the first great thing to know is, that you are clear of your sins, and of sin, too.<a name=37:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The question of sin has been entirely settled in the death of Christ, and now we have to do with another thing; He has gone up to the right hand of God; He has entered within the veil, the Forerunner for us; that place is secured for us by His blood, and now His service is to support and help us all along the road until we get there -- and that is priesthood.<a name=37:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It has been remarked, that it was not the rod of Moses that budded, for that was authority; but it was the rod of Aaron, and that was priesthood.<a name=37:14></a> Priesthood has to do with a feeble folk.<a name=37:15></a> In fact, one gets a
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=38>[Page 38]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		good deal of instruction about it, even in the family circle.<a name=38:1></a> The mere authority of the father will not be enough for the children, you must have grace also.<a name=38:2></a> I am not saying now how you are to deal with their wilfulness, that is another thing; that brings in the advocacy -- I am not going to touch on advocacy more than this.<a name=38:3></a> The moment you sin, it is not priesthood you want: it is advocacy.<a name=38:4></a> Though it is the same Person who is Advocate, and you have to be exercised, as in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#19">Numbers  19</a>, on account of the sin.<a name=38:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the main thing is that the question of sin is altogether settled; there is no imputation of sin whatever.<a name=38:6></a> Priesthood is, that the One who has gone the road, and gone up to the top, and has secured that top for me, is now conducting me along the road in the very same grace in which He walked that road Himself.<a name=38:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the great thing for the heart to enter into is the nature of this ministry, which, as I have said, is pre-figured by Aaron's rod.<a name=38:8></a> The rod budded and blossomed and brought forth fruit, and was placed in the ark of the covenant.<a name=38:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the ground is cleared immensely by seeing that it is not a question of sin at all, but of infirmity.<a name=38:10></a> Infirmity is not sin.<a name=38:11></a> For instance, a nervous character.<a name=38:12></a> I know very well what it is to be startled, and to be so annoyed at being startled as to be ready to express myself very angrily.<a name=38:13></a> It was not wrong to be startled, but it was very wrong to be in a passion.<a name=38:14></a> Therefore you see you are very near sin in infirmity.<a name=38:15></a> The priesthood is to preserve me from it.<a name=38:16></a> The priesthood has to do with my infirmity.<a name=38:17></a> It was not wrong of Sarah to be afraid; but Sarah told a lie, and that was wrong.<a name=38:18></a> Children, if you frighten them, will tell a lie; better avoid such things.<a name=38:19></a> Their feebleness makes them liable; still it is no excuse for the lie.<a name=38:20></a> Timidity is infirmity; a lie is not infirmity, it is sin.<a name=38:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think, when you get hold of this point, you will
	</div>

		<a name=39>[Page 39]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		find immense comfort in studying the priesthood of Christ.<a name=39:1></a> It is that Christ having secured the end, has entered within the veil, He is the Forerunner for us entered, and now His service is to lead us to the very place where He is.<a name=39:2></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>He says, "I go to prepare a place for you", and "Whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do".<a name=39:3></a> That is the measure of His power.<a name=39:4></a> He is telling us that there is no limit to His power up to the place He has prepared for us.<a name=39:5></a> You will find immense blessing when you understand this ministry.<a name=39:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now if you turn to the passage I have read, there are the word and the priesthood.<a name=39:7></a> The word exposes your motives.<a name=39:8></a> "The entrance of thy word giveth light".<a name=39:9></a> I am vexed: well, the question is whether I am rightly vexed or not.<a name=39:10></a> There is such a thing as being angry rightly: I may be rightly indignant with a man for beating a horse; but if he were to turn around and beat myself, I might lose my temper and be vindictive.<a name=39:11></a> Well, the object of the word is to expose, and put me on my guard.<a name=39:12></a> It penetrates; it is not here to restore, but to preserve.<a name=39:13></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>, the word is restorative.<a name=39:14></a> Here it is to make all patent, there is nothing hid from it, it penetrates to the depth of everything: "All things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do".<a name=39:15></a> Therefore, when you come to deal with trials, common as they are all day long, you never can get on if you have not Christ's sympathy; it has a marvellous effect upon you; God grant we may know more of it.<a name=39:16></a> If you are sensible of the continued support of the Lord Jesus Christ in all the little worries of daily life, you gain much spiritually.<a name=39:17></a> That is the real reason why trials do good.<a name=39:18></a> Trials <i>in themselves</i>  do not mellow; as a rule, you will find people hardened by trials.<a name=39:19></a> If I learn the grace of Christ in the trials, I am a different person, I am mellowed by them.<a name=39:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am dwelling now on the difference between the

		<a name=40>[Page 40]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		word and the priesthood.<a name=40:1></a> The word exposes my motive -- whether the rest of God is before me.<a name=40:2></a> All is open to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.<a name=40:3></a> It shows the continued exercise of heart which goes on when we are in the light.<a name=40:4></a> Then, "we have a great high priest that is passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.<a name=40:5></a> For we have not a high priest that cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are, sin apart".<a name=40:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now let us look at the difference between knowing Christ as a Saviour, and as a Priest.<a name=40:7></a> Look at <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#17">1 Samuel  17</a>and 18.<a name=40:8></a> It is surprising, when we come to investigate, how little we know of the priesthood of Christ.<a name=40:9></a> We know something of the Saviour.<a name=40:10></a> One may say, But knowing Him as the Saviour is greater than knowing Him as Priest.<a name=40:11></a> In one sense, it is greater, no doubt; but I think I shall show you that it is as I learn the priesthood, that I begin fully to appreciate the Saviour.<a name=40:12></a> I turn to this passage, because, here you have the mind of a person who enjoys a Saviour, and this in order that you may see the difference between the affection which one has when saved, and the affection one has who has known Christ as Priest.<a name=40:13></a> Here is David with the head of Goliath in his hand; and Jonathan is so affected by what David did, that he loves him as his own soul, and strips himself to give to David.<a name=40:14></a> He had a right sense as to the greatness of what David had done for him in slaying Goliath, but he had not learnt what David's company was, or he would have gone with David, and been able to bear up against all the difficulties which lay between that time and David's time.<a name=40:15></a> I am not saying now whether Jonathan was right or wrong in his course, but that he did not learn the effect of David's company or priesthood.<a name=40:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I turn to <a href="../bible/Ruth.htm#1:16">Ruth  1:16</a>.<a name=40:17></a> "And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following

		after thee; for whither thou goest,.<a name=41:1></a> I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge; thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God".<a name=41:2></a> I bring this forward as an example of the difference between a person who knows Christ as Saviour, and the one who knows Him as Priest.<a name=41:3></a> Of course, I only use it as an illustration.<a name=41:4></a> I want to bring before you the effect of knowing Christ as a Companion in your trials and difficulties here: sustaining you in the very grace He walked in.<a name=41:5></a> I say there is an advance in Ruth beyond Jonathan.<a name=41:6></a> Ruth says, "Intreat me not to leave thee".<a name=41:7></a> Now you find Jonathan <i>can</i>  leave David.<a name=41:8></a> When I learn Christ as Priest, I cannot do without Him; He is my stay.<a name=41:9></a> I have an invisible Friend; He supports me as He had gone the road Himself.<a name=41:10></a> It is not a new path that I make for myself; but as He had gone the road, He supports me.<a name=41:11></a> And thus is my heart drawn out in attachment to Him -- as the child is attached to the mother by nursing; and the more you enjoy this ministry, the less you can do without it.<a name=41:12></a> Therefore Paul could say, I take pleasure in infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.<a name=41:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How was this peculiar affection produced between Ruth and Naomi?<a name=41:14></a> No doubt, Ruth, in the time of her widowhood, found out that Naomi was so necessary to her, that she could not do without her.<a name=41:15></a> "Intreat me not to leave thee .<a name=41:16></a>.<a name=41:17></a> .<a name=41:18></a> for whither thou goest, I will go".<a name=41:19></a> This peculiar affection for Christ, I doubt not, is the great effect of knowing Him as Priest.<a name=41:20></a>

		In Hebrews we are looked at as individuals fit to be companions of the Lord.<a name=42:9></a> There is nothing said there about the greatest thing, namely, that we are united to Him.<a name=42:10></a> I see that all our individual greatness is prospectively with reference to union, and thus it is that we are fit for union.<a name=42:11></a> Thus it comes out in Ephesians.<a name=42:12></a> I mean that it is not by union I get my fitness; I get my fitness by being of Christ; we are "all of One" -- "accepted in the Beloved" -- in order that we might be fit to occupy the position of members of His body.<a name=42:13></a> His ministry as Priest produces another thing, even your attachment to Him.<a name=42:14></a>

		In a subject like this, it is very hard to give a history of it in detail, because every one of our histories is different.<a name=43:4></a> But I do ask you -- and you will find the good of it if you do it -- whenever a trial comes (I have done it myself often) to say to yourself, How does the Lord feel this?<a name=43:5></a> If my own will works, I do not know His sympathy nor learn the way He acted.<a name=43:6></a> Many look to the Lord in their trials, to get help out of them, instead of sympathy in them.<a name=43:7></a> I do not mean by this to make little of His mercy; not at all.<a name=43:8></a> If I have a cold, it is a mercy to get well; I am relieved.<a name=43:9></a> His sympathy supports me when suffering.<a name=43:10></a> If you are in some great trouble, in prison, for instance, and you get out; well, that would be a great mercy.<a name=43:11></a> But the question is, How did I behave in the prison or in the trouble?<a name=43:12></a> If you notice your prayers, you will find that, as a rule your desire is to get out of the difficulty; but it is a great thing to bear up like Christ in the difficulty, because I share His grace in it.<a name=43:13></a> When He pleases, the difficulty is removed, and that is mercy; As Paul said, "The Lord had mercy on him, and not on him only, but on me also".<a name=43:14></a>

		Now I turn to some examples in our Lord's life, which will perhaps explain His sympathy more fully to us.<a name=43:15></a> Look at <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#8:23">Matthew  8:23</a> - 26.<a name=43:16></a> "And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him.<a name=43:17></a> behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves; but he was asleep.<a name=43:18></a> And his disciples came to him and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us; we perish.<a name=43:19></a> And he

		Here there was a storm, and they were all troubled, and the Lord was asleep.<a name=44:9></a> It requires great nearness to the Lord to know how He regards the trial in which I am.<a name=44:10></a> He is always in the aspect suited to my need.<a name=44:11></a> He can say, I have been through it all, I am able to bring you out of it fully -- for He is fully out of it.<a name=44:12></a> Now here is a storm, and He was asleep, the disciples are troubled and awake Him to save them by His power.<a name=44:13></a> If they had sought His sympathy, they would have said, We will see what He can be to us now.<a name=44:14></a> Look what an effect the trial would then have had upon them.<a name=44:15></a> True they got out of the trial.<a name=44:16></a> Many a one has got out of a trial who has gained nothing in it.<a name=44:17></a> But how different would have been their gain if they had said, Well, He is asleep, He is superior to the storm.<a name=44:18></a> You may say, But how can we know?<a name=44:19></a> Well, the Lord is ever thinking about you, He never leaves nor forsakes us.<a name=44:20></a>

		When you get the subject before your mind, it is easy to find examples and illustrations of His sympathy.<a name=46:14></a> There is one passage I must dwell a little on, because it shows the completeness of how Christ bears us up all the way.<a name=46:15></a> I turn to the end of <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7">Acts  7</a>.<a name=46:16></a> In the case of Stephen, you get Christ's present support beautifully brought before us in the smallest compass: "He, being full of the Holy Spirit, looked up steadfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus".<a name=46:17></a> That is, he saw the spot Christ's work had secured for him -- in fact, he crossed the Jordan.<a name=46:18></a> I

		I have read this passage because it describes the first time that the Holy Spirit came down to us, and then was established the habitation of God by the Spirit.<a name=49:4></a> We read in the last verse of the second of Ephesians, "In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit".<a name=49:5></a> Now that is a great thing to start with -- that God has a habitation on the earth.<a name=49:6></a> In <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2">Ephesians  2</a>is, "In whom ye are builded together"; the true building is spoken of.<a name=49:7></a> I do not mean to go into how that has been intruded into.<a name=49:8></a> how certain men have "crept in unawares", bad building.<a name=49:9></a> and the like.<a name=49:10></a> What I mean to occupy your attention with is the nature of this structure, "the habitation of God through the Spirit".<a name=49:11></a> It is established here in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>.<a name=49:12></a> There were two actions of the Holy Spirit, and one of those actions I do not mean to speak much of.<a name=49:13></a> But the great point is that the first action is connected with the congregation.<a name=49:14></a> "There came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting".<a name=49:15></a> It does not say it filled the walls, "but all the house where they were sitting"; these latter words you must keep distinctly in your mind; that is, the congregation, with it the Spirit connects Himself.<a name=49:16></a> The other action of the Holy Spirit is that He fills each of them individually.<a name=49:17></a> So there were two fillings.<a name=49:18></a> It is very important for the soul to be

		Now I turn to a few scriptures, as though you were studying it for the first time; because after all, we are practically very unacquainted with the reality of this truth.<a name=50:11></a> Turn to <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:15">Matthew  16:15</a> - 18.<a name=50:12></a> "He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?<a name=50:13></a> And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.<a name=50:14></a> And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona, for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.<a name=50:15></a> And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it".<a name=50:16></a> That is the first time we get the statement, "My church".<a name=50:17></a> The word 'assembly', as you all know, occurs in the Old Testament, but here is the

		Lord saying, I will build <i>my</i>  assembly.<a name=51:1></a> And in what connection does that statement come forth?<a name=51:2></a> If you look back to chapter 14: 10, you will see what led to this, "And he sent and beheaded John in the prison".<a name=51:3></a> Now that intimated to the Lord that He would be rejected by His own people.<a name=51:4></a> God had dwelt in the cloud among Israel, but the glory had departed.<a name=51:5></a> But now the Lord, from that verse up to this point (I am not going into it, but it is an interesting scripture), is educating His disciples for this great announcement, even that He will have a new structure, and that new structure is "My assembly".<a name=51:6></a> He announces, "Upon this rock I will build my assembly", and that rock was the Son of God.<a name=51:7></a> That is the nature of the teaching, or education, which I believe every one of us has to go through, in order to learn the assembly.<a name=51:8></a> I do not dwell on the education, but rather on the result of the education.<a name=51:9></a> It is an interesting moment.<a name=51:10></a> The Lord says.<a name=51:11></a> "I will build my church".<a name=51:12></a> He does not say, I have built it.<a name=51:13></a> Many think that the assembly dates down from Abel.<a name=51:14></a> No, it is entirely a new thing, and a new thing consequent upon Christ being refused by His own people.<a name=51:15></a> I am not referring to the body, that is when He is entirely rejected as glorified, that is a different thing, though they conjoin, they go together.<a name=51:16></a> But the house, the habitation of God, is a thing manifest on this earth.<a name=51:17></a> I do not know anywhere in Scripture that you could say that the body was manifested.<a name=51:18></a> On the contrary, the body, as far as I see from Scripture, is hidden, save as to its works.<a name=51:19></a> I believe that it is the vital thing in the assembly.<a name=51:20></a>

		Now I have a very interesting thing to put before you, and that is, I am not asking you, Are you saved?<a name=52:5></a> I do not doubt it; but have you a sense in your soul that you are material for Christ's building?<a name=52:6></a> This is more than your salvation; it is consequent on and corroborates your salvation, for how could you be a stone, a living stone, if you are not saved?<a name=52:7></a> "To whom coming as unto a living stone".<a name=52:8></a> When you understand this, a wonderful light comes into the soul, and you can say, Thank God I am a bit of Christ's building.<a name=52:9></a> You are a component part of the structure which Christ builds.<a name=52:10></a> That is the great thing.<a name=52:11></a> Hence he says, "To whom coming .<a name=52:12></a>.<a name=52:13></a>.<a name=52:14></a> ye also, as living stones, are built up a spiritual house".<a name=52:15></a> Now that is not the same kind of union as in the body, though it is important to understand that the Spirit is the hold in each, a binding as a stone in a building.<a name=52:16></a> Wherever you might be, you would still be a stone in the building.<a name=52:17></a> But you are not in assembly function except when you are assembled, gathered of God.<a name=52:18></a> If I might illustrate it by an ordinary subject, all the members of parliament together in a room, would not be parliament; they are not convened.<a name=52:19></a> Therefore, a believers' meeting, as such, is not the assembly at all.<a name=52:20></a> The assembly is called God's assembly; or, as our blessed Lord called it here, "My assembly".<a name=52:21></a> Our idea of the assembly is borrowed from Christendom, and thus regarded as "the congregation of the faithful".<a name=52:22></a> Now nothing can be plainer than that when a great person has an assembly, he is chief in that assembly.<a name=52:23></a> If I went to a man's house who had invited me, and saw a great many collected there, but not the master of the house, I should say I had made a mistake; I came here at

		In this passage we see the pattern.<a name=54:13></a> There are two great things in this pattern -- one is, how He fitted His disciples to be component parts of this great assembly; and the other is, that being fitted, He instructed them as to their responsibilities.<a name=54:14></a> This is a pattern of the introduction to the assembly, and therefore not required for those introduced.<a name=54:15></a> I do not think that every believer (though his right is unquestionable) is intelligently a component part of Christ's building, a living stone, a component part of the most august assembly that ever was upon the earth.<a name=54:16></a> I speak now of "My assembly", because you cannot be occupied with Christ, if your own state still occupies you.<a name=54:17></a> Hence the first thing the Lord says, in order to fit His disciples for this new place, is "Peace unto you"; He clears them from every

		In the previous chapter, you will find how the apostle distinguishes the ministry of the assembly from the ministry of the gospel.<a name=62:5></a> He says in verse 23, "If Ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel which ye have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven, whereof I Paul am made a minister" -- that is, he was a minister of the gospel -"who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake which is the church; whereof I am made a minister".<a name=62:6></a> It was not that the Colossians had not heard of this second ministry, but they were not in the power of it.<a name=62:7></a> They had the ministry of the gospel, and very interesting they seemed to be from the way the apostle writes to them in the early part of the first chapter.<a name=62:8></a> "Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have to all the saints".<a name=62:9></a> Now they had the ministry of the gospel, and they were exemplary too -- "faith in Christ Jesus, and love to all the saints".<a name=62:10></a>

		I have read about the two rams.<a name=76:9></a> Now if you do not understand the first ram, you will never under- stand the second one.<a name=76:10></a> The first ram is the burnt-offering; it is gone up whole.<a name=76:11></a> Mind you, that is not the sin-offering.<a name=76:12></a> The sin-offering establishes a basis, by virtue of what Christ has done, that God can receive you in His presence.<a name=76:13></a> The burnt-offering goes farther, because it shows me not only that He can receive me, but the nature of my reception; a very important point.<a name=76:14></a> A person might be received in a very grand

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now look at the other ram, that is the consecration ram.<a name=78:2></a> Look at the two rams; one ram typifies Christ glorifying God and now gone up to Him, and the other ram is how He, the glorified One, is to you.<a name=78:3></a> That is its great point -- What is Christ to you?<a name=78:4></a> We are complete in Christ; I see what He is to God in the burnt-offering, but what am I?<a name=78:5></a> Hence you see, first the ram for the burnt-offering was brought, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on it, and it was killed, and the blood sprinkled on the altar, and the whole ram burnt.<a name=78:6></a> Then the other ram was brought, and Moses took of the blood of it (and now we are all under the virtue of the blood); it was put on the ear, the hand, and the foot, and all in connection with the high priest, for we enter the holy place as his house.<a name=78:7></a> But that was not all.<a name=78:8></a> Then come the fat and the inwards, etc.<a name=78:9></a>, typifying the pure perfect motives of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=78:10></a> Thus I come into the presence of God in the sense of the fragrance of Christ.<a name=78:11></a> The prodigal had the best robe on; invested with the beauty of Christ which has come out from heaven.<a name=78:12></a> Thus I am brought into correspondence with a greater One who is inside.<a name=78:13></a> I mean correspondence with Christ, the burnt-offering, now glorified.<a name=78:14></a> Of course, we do not come up to the greatness of what He is, but I am brought into correspondence with that blessed, glorified One.<a name=78:15></a> I have nothing of myself, I am filled with what He is to God.<a name=78:16></a> The idea of consecration is rarely apprehended; some talk of giving up themselves to the Lord.<a name=78:17></a> In presenting my body as a living sacrifice I am only yielding that to which the Lord has the right; for it necessarily follows, that if Christ has freed me from the old master, the flesh, He has the right to the body now.<a name=78:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we turn to the New Testament, and get it all plainer, surely.<a name=79:5></a> Still, I trust the sense is awakened in your soul, by the beauty of the type, of the wonderful nature of our entrance into the true tabernacle.<a name=79:6></a> Well, you know that Christ has gone up into the presence of God, raised up and glorified; and you know that you can enter in to be assimilated to Him there.<a name=79:7></a> You come in, in the fragrance of Jesus in the glory of God.<a name=79:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#3">2 Corinthians  3</a>, the point of the argument is, that if that which was done away was glorious, how much more glorious is that which remains; that if the ministration of condemnation was glorious, how much more does the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.<a name=79:9></a> What we find is that now that our blessed Lord has been received up into glory, it is not a demand for righteousness, but the very opposite, there is a ministration of righteousness; the greatest moral revolution ever known.<a name=79:10></a> Now we behold the Lord's glory, His face is unveiled.<a name=79:11></a> You are looking at a Person in glory; we have looked at the type, now look at the reality.<a name=79:12></a> You are looking at the Lord's glory.<a name=79:13></a> I hear people sometimes say, I am looking at the Lord.<a name=79:14></a> I say you have left out a word; it is looking at the Lord's glory.<a name=79:15></a> Why do I make such a

		<a name=80>[Page 80]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		point of looking at the Lord's glory?<a name=80:1></a> Because the glory is the expression of the divine satisfaction in the One who has accomplished everything according to the glory of God.<a name=80:2></a> What is the glory of God?<a name=80:3></a> When God said to Moses, I will show you the back parts, He could not show him the glory fully, because it was not fully come out.<a name=80:4></a> It was not yet the ministration of righteousness, and love could not come out without righteousness.<a name=80:5></a> The glory could not be displayed all round; it was not equipoised.<a name=80:6></a> The Lord Jesus Christ, He, as man, glorified God.<a name=80:7></a> Glory can be displayed!<a name=80:8></a> Hence the apostle says in the next chapter, that which could not have been said before -- mark the expression: "The light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ".<a name=80:9></a> But glory is the expression of the Father's satisfaction according to all His attributes; and that never could have come out till now, and it now rests on the glorified Man.<a name=80:10></a> The Holy Spirit has come down from that glorified One.<a name=80:11></a> Ezekiel in a vision saw a man in the glory (<a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#1:26">Ezekiel  1:26</a>), but it is not only a man in the glory, it is that the glory <i>rests</i>  upon a Man.<a name=80:12></a> As it is in another place, He is crowned with glory and honour.<a name=80:13></a> He has glorified God in the very place of judgement upon man; as Man He so glorified God that the glory of the Father claimed Him.<a name=80:14></a> It was not only glory saluting Him as in the mount of Transfiguration, but the glory claimed Him.<a name=80:15></a> I am looking at the Lord's glory; I am looking at the One who has established everything according to the nature of God; His righteousness, His truth, His love, His majesty, His honour, everything is there consistently.<a name=80:16></a> That is the Lord's glory; and I am looking at it.<a name=80:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next I learn the effect.<a name=80:18></a> Beholding the Lord's glory, we are transformed; it is the strongest word used in the language, it is stronger than changed, it is 'metamorphosed'; you are changed morally into another being altogether, "into the same image".<a name=80:19></a>

		It is not only that I can reach this bright place, it is not only that I can enter into, but am actually made to correspond with the condition suited to it.<a name=81:6></a> The state of holiness is an inseparable condition for entering the holiest, but assimilation to the glory is the condition acquired within (we are not come to position yet, we have only to do with condition), but instead of being a stranger in this place, on the contrary I find that the more I behold the Lord's glory -- mind, it is not a question of place, but of condition -- I am "transformed into the same image from glory to glory as by the Spirit of the Lord".<a name=81:7></a> I hope we know something about it; but if the Psalmist could say, When I went into the Sanctuary I was completely altered as to my judgement of things, how much more should you and I be altered!<a name=81:8></a> I am not speaking now of enjoyment; I am insisting on what really belongs to us.<a name=81:9></a> If I were a solicitor, and telling a man of a fortune to which he was entitled, he would be arrested.<a name=81:10></a> I am now telling you of your title to a much greater thing than an earthly fortune.<a name=81:11></a> I am trying to make it clear to you, that glory is your property.<a name=81:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		One may not understand how he could be transformed.<a name=81:13></a> If you were beholding the Lord's glory, you would understand it.<a name=81:14></a> But I will give you an example, Paul prayed three times for the removal of a thorn; and he was a very spiritual man.<a name=81:15></a> He was trying to get rid of this thorn but at length he found out that it was better to take pleasure in it.<a name=81:16></a> He was a wonderfully changed man; and how did it happen?<a name=81:17></a> By

	<div class="paragraph">
		I may give you another example.<a name=82:3></a> We are told to make known all our requests unto God, and the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep our hearts and minds.<a name=82:4></a> That is the experience of a heavenly man.<a name=82:5></a> The effect, an effect that passeth all understanding, of being in the presence of God.<a name=82:6></a> I want to press upon you this passage, "Beholding the Lord's glory".<a name=82:7></a> It will afford wonderful delight to your heart -- you will see every attribute of God's nature established in that blessed Person; the effect upon me of beholding, will be to be transformed into the same image.<a name=82:8></a> Could anything be more exquisite than that?<a name=82:9></a> Because it is not merely that I have reached the highest place, but I am actually made to correspond with the highest moral beauty there.<a name=82:10></a> Now if you understand that sentence you understand everything.<a name=82:11></a> The greatest potentate on the earth might receive me into his presence, and might treat me with the greatest friendship, but he could not transform me, he could not make me correspond with himself.<a name=82:12></a> But here is the most wonderful thing, I am changed, transformed into the same image.<a name=82:13></a> No wonder Paul said, "To God, I am beside myself".<a name=82:14></a> It is not now merely what you get with the Psalmist, that all your preconceived notions are reversed, but that you yourself are changed -- you are being assimilated to the glory.<a name=82:15></a>

		The next thing is, He is the true light.<a name=93:7></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>the first thing I get is, "The true light was that which, coming into the world, lightens every man"; and a little lower down (verse 17) -- I will put them together -- "The law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ".<a name=93:8></a> You see I put grace and truth together.<a name=93:9></a> I am looking now at what <i>He is</i> .<a name=93:10></a> He is Light, and light is what I call the moral being of God.<a name=93:11></a> But more than that, He comes to declare God: "The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him".<a name=93:12></a> Now He has not only come, but, having come, He does two things.<a name=93:13></a> He exposes what is <i>not</i>  of God, and discloses what GOD is.<a name=93:14></a> Follow that, and see what a pathway it is!<a name=93:15></a> Read down the gospel narrative, and you will see how He exposes all -- all that was good in the eyes of man, religious, comely, amiable; and, on the other hand, He could say, "He that hath <i>seen ME hath seen the Father</i>".<a name=93:16></a> Does your soul take in the moral grandeur of such a course?<a name=93:17></a> Let us see how it works.<a name=93:18></a> In the early part of John you find that the first great thing He did was to set forth what God is.<a name=93:19></a> He tells us, "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life"; but I do not go into that now.<a name=93:20></a>

		Let us pursue the history of this blessed Person -- God's Son come into the world and announced from glory: "I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people, for unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord".<a name=109:10></a> In <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#3:22">Luke  3:22</a> you read, "And the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven which said, Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleased".<a name=109:11></a> Now this was after thirty years of private life.<a name=109:12></a> But mark this, the heaven is opened and a Voice comes -- there is a Man upon earth that is well pleasing to the Father, "Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased".<a name=109:13></a> After He had taken His place with the godly remnant in baptism, there comes this announcement from heaven.<a name=109:14></a> Upon this Man, whom the glory announced, the Holy Spirit descends in bodily shape like a dove.<a name=109:15></a> A Man, thirty years of age, was anointed with the Holy Spirit and with power, and enters on public service, and this culminates in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#9">Luke  9</a>, where, "as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering, and behold there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias, who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.<a name=109:16></a>

		Turn now to <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7:55">Acts  7:55</a>, "He being full of the Holy Spirit, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus".<a name=112:14></a> Here I would try to explain what the glory is.<a name=112:15></a> It is not a place.<a name=112:16></a> I believe the glory is the manifestation of God according to His attributes; there is nothing left out.<a name=112:17></a> I gather this idea from <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#33:18">Exodus  33:18</a>, where Moses says, "Shew me thy glory", and God answers, "I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy.<a name=112:18></a> And he said, Thou canst not see my face; for there shall no man see me and live.<a name=112:19></a> And the Lord said, There is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock; and it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by; and I will take

		Now I turn back to <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7">Acts  7</a>, and there I see the Holy Spirit upon the earth in a saint.<a name=113:7></a> The Holy Spirit came from a glorified Christ, "The Holy Spirit was not yet; because that Jesus was not yet: glorified"; that is one of the consequences.<a name=113:8></a> If Christ has the highest place in heaven, He has the greatest power on earth.<a name=113:9></a> "Stephen, being full of the Holy Spirit, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus".<a name=113:10></a> He saw a Man in the glory.<a name=113:11></a> He saw the fulfilment of <a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#1:26">Ezekiel  1:26</a>.<a name=113:12></a> He turns round and says to the Jews, "I see the Son of man standing on the right hand of God".<a name=113:13></a> They were just as wicked in that day as in Ezekiel's day, a day older and a day worse, and they stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord.<a name=113:14></a> But that is not all; that was the opening out of a new era, because the heaven was opened, the first time heaven was opened to a man, and that to show him a Saviour in glory, and, thank God, it has been open ever since.<a name=113:15></a> We are looking now at what has been wrought by a Saviour in glory; but this is not all.<a name=113:16></a> Turn to chapter 9, and we find that the Saviour in glory has come down and made Himself known to a sinner on earth.<a name=113:17></a> To my own personal

	<div class="paragraph">
		I would dwell on the wonderful change that has taken place.<a name=114:5></a> It is not merely the difference between Stephen and Isaiah.<a name=114:6></a> Isaiah could not look up into heaven.<a name=114:7></a> Stephen can say, I have a Saviour there; the new line is open, and every believer now travels that line; and that is not all, but that a Saviour in glory can be revealed in a light above the brightness of the sun to a sinner, and the chief of sinners.<a name=114:8></a> I repeat, that many, who believe in the grace shown to Stephen, do not apprehend the gospel in that largeness in which it is presented in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9">Acts  9</a>.<a name=114:9></a>

		Now I turn to 2 Corinthians 3: 7: "But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance, which glory was to be done away, how shall not the ministration of the Spirit be rather glorious?<a name=114:10></a> For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory".<a name=114:11></a> Now what is the argument here?<a name=114:12></a> It is very simple.<a name=114:13></a> There was a demand for righteousness from the glory of God, so that Moses himself said, "I exceedingly fear and quake".<a name=114:14></a> Again, when Israel saw the glory upon Moses' face they were afraid, because they were afraid of its demand, so much so that Moses had to put a veil upon his face.<a name=114:15></a> Now this is the argument of the apostle: -- If the

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=115>[Page 115]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		demand for righteousness was from glory, and it was the ministry of condemnation, how much more does the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory?<a name=115:1></a> The meaning of that is, that the ministration of righteousness now comes from the glory.<a name=115:2></a> Instead of a demand for righteousness, there is a ministration of righteousness from the glory; and I need not tell you, that if it comes from the glory it is divine righteousness, God's righteousness.<a name=115:3></a> And the argument of the apostle is that now, righteousness from the glory is ministered.<a name=115:4></a> It is not a demand; that was a ministration of condemnation.<a name=115:5></a> This is a ministration of righteousness, the ministration of the Spirit.<a name=115:6></a> Hence what we find now is, that it is not only that you have a Saviour in glory, but that you are brought in divine suitability to that glory.<a name=115:7></a> If you look for the doctrine of it, it is explained very clearly in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:18">Romans  5:18</a>: "Therefore as by one offence, judgement came upon all men to condemnation; even so by one righteousness the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life".<a name=115:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am dwelling a little on this point, because some hold to what is called 'imputed righteousness'.<a name=115:9></a> Well, I have no righteousness but Christ's righteousness, the righteousness of the glorified Man.<a name=115:10></a> I have His righteousness because I have His life.<a name=115:11></a> Hence you get in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:18">Romans  5:18</a> "justification of life".<a name=115:12></a> I have His life; and I enter into all that He is.<a name=115:13></a> In the end of the fourth chapter of Romans, I am cleared from all my sins: "He was delivered for our offences and was raised for our justification".<a name=115:14></a> But we are beyond, because we have the life of the One who cleared us.<a name=115:15></a> Therefore it is "<i>justification of life</i>.<a name=115:16></a>" In the end of the fifth chapter of Romans, "Where sin abounded, grace did much more abound".<a name=115:17></a> The excess is, that grace reigns through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord; <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:21">Romans  5:21</a>.<a name=115:18></a> I am brought in divine righteousness to the glory.<a name=115:19></a> It is

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here is the Son of man gone up into glory; and consequently, not a demand for righteousness, but a ministration of righteousness -- the greatest moral revolution.<a name=116:4></a> The glory rests on a Man.<a name=116:5></a> God always had love, but He could not show it, because, righteousness was not revealed.<a name=116:6></a> Jesus so satisfies the holiness of God, that the moment He died, the veil was rent from the top to the bottom; it is not merely that we may draw nigh, but God can come out consistently with His nature, and take a poor prodigal into His arms.<a name=116:7></a> And the prodigal is not only reconciled, but brought in divine righteousness -- divine suitability -- into the Father's house.<a name=116:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are three things that result from a glorified Christ.<a name=116:9></a> One is that the Holy Spirit has come down from the glorified Man.<a name=116:10></a> Man in the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ must be set in the highest place, before the greatest power can be sent down to man on earth.<a name=116:11></a> When He was exalted to the highest place with God, God then sent down the Holy Spirit, to His own, to maintain for Him in the very place where He was rejected.<a name=116:12></a> And necessarily so.<a name=116:13></a> If the world rejects Him, God exalts Him, and when God exalted Him, the Holy Spirit came down to His own, in the very place where He was rejected.<a name=116:14></a> Christendom has lost sight of this altogether.<a name=116:15></a> If you do not believe in the exaltation of Christ, you do not believe in the manifestation of the power of the Spirit in the place of His rejection.<a name=116:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second is, there is divine righteousness ministered from the glory.<a name=116:17></a> It is not clearance only; that, thank God, we have, but there is a ministration of righteousness from the glory.<a name=116:18></a> It is not like Isaiah

	<div class="paragraph">
		trembling before it, and it is not like even Moses who could not see it, but what we have is this -- a righteousness which suits the glory.<a name=117:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there is the third, which is <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#3:18">2 Corinthians  3:18</a>, "But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord".<a name=117:2></a> Now the right reading of the passage is, "Beholding the glory of the Lord with unveiled face".<a name=117:3></a> Moses had a veil on his face; but there is no veil on Christ's face, as you read in the next chapter, "The light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ".<a name=117:4></a> I believe every ray of divine glory rests in that blessed One.<a name=117:5></a> His work is the ground for its manifestation, not that it was not there before; but until He, the Son of man, died and was glorified, it could not be manifested to us.<a name=117:6></a> God's love is now declared; He always was love; but now His love can come out, because His righteousness is established; there is nothing wanting to complete the circle of His attributes -- everything divinely balanced.<a name=117:7></a> I think when we come to practice we shall understand it better.<a name=117:8></a> A person is sometimes too loving, sometimes too righteous.<a name=117:9></a> It may be a very good thing that you have, but you are too one-sided; you could not be one-sided in the glory; there all is even, every virtue equipoised.<a name=117:10></a> The glory of God rests upon the Man who has done all His pleasure, and, thank God, that Man is our Saviour.<a name=117:11></a> Are you beholding the Lord's glory?<a name=117:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the third consequence of beholding the Lord's glory -- not beholding the Lord, as people sometimes say, nor beholding the glory; that will not do; because I think there is an immense importance connected with the simple fact, that I am looking at Him as the bearer of God's satisfaction, according to all His attributes; and the effect upon me is that I am brought into moral correspondence with it; nothing

		less could suit the Father's pleasure.<a name=118:1></a> Therefore the true state of a believer now is, <a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:17">1 John  4:17</a>, "Herein is love with us made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgement, because as he is, so are we in this world".<a name=118:2></a> This is his present state.<a name=118:3></a> God could have no lower standard than Christ, and nothing can satisfy His love except His own standard.<a name=118:4></a> And if His love is perfected with you -- if God's love has shone into you, it has had this peculiar effect on you, it assures you that as Jesus is accepted up there at God's right hand, so are you sitting in this room.<a name=118:5></a> You may say, It is marvellous.<a name=118:6></a> So it is; but it makes us narrow-minded if we look at the gospel only as it relates to ourselves: you must bear in mind God's interest in the gospel.<a name=118:7></a> Hence it is, when His love according to its true character (that is the force of the word) shines into you, it tells you this -- that nothing less could satisfy that love than that you should be in the same acceptance before Him, as Christ is at His own right hand.<a name=118:8></a> It is not the question of how you feel, it is the question of what that love is -- and this explains the marvellousness of the grace.<a name=118:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us examine more in detail the effect consequent on Christ being glorified.<a name=118:10></a> Turn to <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:3">2 Corinthians  4:3</a>, 4: "But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them".<a name=118:11></a> "The glorious gospel" is not a correct reading, but "the gospel of the glory of Christ".<a name=118:12></a> It is that now the light comes down from the top, from the finish of the work, to the bottom where the sinner is.<a name=118:13></a> Doubtless to make the sinner sensible, That is light; but not to condemn him, or to demand of him -- not at all; but to conduct him to the top, to the finish.<a name=118:14></a> I ask you earnestly, Has your heart travelled that road?<a name=118:15></a> The light comes down to the bottom where the sinner is,

		Our subject this evening, beloved friends, is the Holy Spirit's descent to this earth.<a name=122:2></a> Not merely His coming to the earth (every believer owns that), but the first point I press is, that the Holy Spirit is <i>residing</i>  here.<a name=122:3></a> I use the word 'residing' because it is here that the defect in our faith lies.<a name=122:4></a> The Holy Spirit is in residence here; and if this fact were known and held in faith, it would have an amazing effect upon us.<a name=122:5></a> The Holy Spirit is invisible to the world; He is not sent to the world, and He is not visible to you practically if you are worldly.<a name=122:6></a>

		The first great fact, then, for you to lay hold of is -- this blessed Person has come to reside here, in the very scene where Christ was rejected.<a name=122:7></a> Christ has been rejected on the earth, refused and cast out, and God has exalted Him to the very highest place in heaven.<a name=122:8></a> As a Man He is in exaltation in heaven, at the right hand of God.<a name=122:9></a> What higher place could He have?<a name=122:10></a> But then, what about the place where He is rejected?<a name=122:11></a> If we look at Christendom, we see the defect broadly, and it is our common shame.<a name=122:12></a> In Christendom there is but little sense of the exaltation of our Lord Jesus Christ, and consequently but little sense of the presence of the Holy Spirit on earth.<a name=122:13></a> As to ourselves, we do not walk about sufficiently with the sense of the exaltation of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=122:14></a> I am sure, if we were in faith as to His exaltation in heaven, if our hearts were better acquainted with Him in that exaltation at God's right hand, we should at once apprehend that there <i>must</i>  be One here, <i>commensurate with Himself</i> , to maintain

		Now I turn to <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:26">John  14:26</a>, and I bring this scripture before you to show you that the Holy Spirit has another mission -- the same Person, but with two different missions.<a name=126:14></a> Just as a man may be both a husband and a father: the same man, but in two different relationships and with different duties.<a name=126:15></a> Now I read this verse, "But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me".<a name=126:16></a> "Whom I will send unto you".<a name=126:17></a> Now here it is Christ who sends, but He adds, "which proceedeth from the Father".<a name=126:18></a> It is in connection with the Father, and this connection is most important.<a name=126:19></a> He is the Spirit of truth, and <i>He shall testify of Me</i>  .<a name=126:20></a> No other power could.<a name=126:21></a> He is the alone power to testify of Christ.<a name=126:22></a> And nothing exposes the lack of faith in the church more than the attempt to use any other power than the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=126:23></a> What other power could testify of the glorified Christ?<a name=126:24></a> Has the church sunk so low that she has no sense of the greatness of the Head in heaven, and thinks she can

		On the former evening our subject was the Spirit of God having come down to reside in the place of Christ's rejection.<a name=142:2></a> It is consistent that, as Christ is exalted to the highest place in heaven, there should be a divine Person to maintain for Him in the scene of His rejection.<a name=142:3></a> If we were to see some great luminary in the sky, we should all accept it; but the Holy Spirit is invisible to the world, He is only known to faith; "The world seeth him not, neither knoweth him".<a name=142:4></a> Do you think God would send Him down here to be seen by the world?<a name=142:5></a> Here, where His Son had been rejected?<a name=142:6></a> Impossible.<a name=142:7></a> You believe in a glorified Christ?<a name=142:8></a> Yes.<a name=142:9></a> Well, then, you have the Holy Spirit down here.<a name=142:10></a> The Holy Spirit here is the answer to Christ glorified.<a name=142:11></a> It would not be possible, looking at what God is in Himself, that He should exalt Christ to the highest place in heaven, and leave His own in the scene of His rejection overlooked and uncared for.<a name=142:12></a> Therefore the Holy Spirit comes down to us in this place.<a name=142:13></a> And, as I tried to bring before you, there are three spheres of His action here -- there is the house in which He dwells, there is the body which He forms, and there is the individual whom He serves.<a name=142:14></a> There is the collective temple and there is the individual temple.<a name=142:15></a> Still, as the words pass out of one's lips, one is sensible how little one enters into the magnitude of what is stated.<a name=142:16></a> The lack is, that there is not simple faith as to the reality of the truth I am propounding.<a name=142:17></a>

		I turn to <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:18">Matthew  16:18</a>, because it is the first time that "My assembly" is referred to: "I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it".<a name=143:1></a> It is a very important principle in Scripture that whenever a thing is first spoken of, though it be not developed, yet you get the great features that characterise it.<a name=143:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will divide the subject into parts to make it simple: the first part is the origin of "My assembly".<a name=143:3></a> It is a great point to lay hold of the fact that "My assembly" is a new thing.<a name=143:4></a> The word 'assembly' is not a new word.<a name=143:5></a> We read in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7">Acts  7</a>of the assembly that was in the wilderness; but the word 'My' is what is new, "My assembly".<a name=143:6></a> It is a little word, but it is of great importance; because the fact of its being His assembly necessarily implies that He is there Himself.<a name=143:7></a> He would not call it "My assembly" if He were not there Himself.<a name=143:8></a> In the Old Testament we read of the assembly, but never of "My assembly".<a name=143:9></a> And hence Paul says to Timothy, "That thou mightest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God".<a name=143:10></a> Mind the word 'living'.<a name=143:11></a> I press it, because I think we are liable to forget the solemnity of the assembly.<a name=143:12></a> God's assembly must be a company to suit God, though I am not speaking of the company, but of the Person who has the company, "That thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God"- it does not say "in the body", it could not say that, but "in the house of God, which is the assembly of the living God".<a name=143:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am not speaking of the body this evening, but of the house -- the temple.<a name=143:14></a> The house is the earthly aspect, the body is the heavenly aspect.<a name=143:15></a> No doubt those who compose the house -- the true ones, "living stones"- are the body.<a name=143:16></a>

		I must allude to a very interesting thing here, and one of great import: it is that when a soul has found rest in Christ and His work, the very first thing that occurs to that soul is, Has God a place here?<a name=145:7></a> My authority for this is <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15:2">Exodus  15:2</a>, "I will prepare him an habitation".<a name=145:8></a> You may be occupied with the blessing and going on with it, but when you have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, the first question that will occur to your mind is, Has He any place of His own on the earth where He wrought out my salvation?<a name=145:9></a> Hence the language of the Psalmist is the language of many a true-hearted soul, "I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids, until I find out a place for the Lord, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob".<a name=145:10></a> Believe me, this is a true experience; and the reason why Christendom has not found out this, the second part of the song (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15">Exodus  15</a>), is because they have not learned the first part of it, namely, "The Lord hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea".<a name=145:11></a> Have you peace with God, able to say, I am delivered from the power of the enemy?<a name=145:12></a> It is not only that you are sheltered by the blood, but that you are delivered from the power of death, you are brought out of Egypt, you are on resurrection ground; "Being justified by faith, we have peace with God".<a name=145:13></a> There are three things, as has often been said, in that song.<a name=145:14></a> The first is, the sense of what He has done; the second, you desire to glorify Him, prepare Him a dwelling; and third, "Thou shalt bring them in and

		I have dwelt long on the origin because it is an important point.<a name=146:2></a> Christ has been rejected here, but He has a structure here at this minute, against which all the powers of hell cannot prevail.<a name=146:3></a> And that is an immense thing for the heart; it is the breakwater against the violence of man.<a name=146:4></a> How it ought to cheer our hearts that there is a structure built upon this earth by Christ, which all the power of hell cannot shake!<a name=146:5></a>

		I turn to my fellow Christians in system; I have a great respect for them.<a name=150:4></a> What is the character of the building which they call the church?<a name=150:5></a> First, it is constructed as much like Solomon's temple as possible.<a name=150:6></a> The next thing is, that as you walk up the aisle, right before you there is what is called the communion table, where the clergy only are allowed to be, and no one else.<a name=150:7></a> It is the holy ground.<a name=150:8></a> It is in imitation of the sanctuary.<a name=150:9></a> Now the sanctuary, and not an imitation of it, is the proper place for every believer, for every believer is a priest.<a name=150:10></a> It is not merely a believers' meeting, with great enjoyment that the Lord has saved us, and we remember that He died for us.<a name=150:11></a> We must remember that Christendom in its worst form makes everything of the mass.<a name=150:12></a> In the Lord's presence, the sanctuary, the <i>first</i>  thing which should engage your attention is the Lord's supper -- that you call Him to mind in His death.<a name=150:13></a> You cannot greet Him but as remembering Him in death, dwelling on what the love of His heart was, that He should go into death for me.<a name=150:14></a> But that is not all.<a name=150:15></a> You have Himself now, you are in His company -- the apostle and High Priest of our profession.<a name=150:16></a> You are entranced with the Minister of the holy places, you are now conducted into participation of all the heavenly blessing which He is in, you now learn what it is to be in the sanctuary.<a name=150:17></a> They try to imitate it in Christendom; through divine mercy you are enlightened and can enjoy the real thing.<a name=150:18></a> I admit it is in ruins, but remember it is His house.<a name=150:19></a> We ought to be the more zealous because of the state of things.<a name=150:20></a> See how the Lord respected the temple: "The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up".<a name=150:21></a> Does the zeal of His house eat you up?<a name=150:22></a> When the Lord was here, the glory had departed from the house.<a name=150:23></a>

		What should characterise us then, with the Lord of glory in our midst?<a name=151:1></a> You never can refute an imitation but by presenting the reality.<a name=151:2></a> There is not a shade of distance between Him and you in the sanctuary; all is heavenly, a heavenly atmosphere brought in by Himself in the midst of His own, just as the tabernacle was a heavenly construction in the midst of the twelve tribes.<a name=151:3></a> The mistake of Christendom is, they make the laity to be the antitype of the twelve tribes, and the clergy the antitype of the priests.<a name=151:4></a> The antitype of the twelve tribes has not come yet.<a name=151:5></a> Israel in the millennium will be the antitype.<a name=151:6></a>

		The next branch of the subject is the company who enjoy the sanctuary -- as it is said in Peter, "a holy priesthood".<a name=151:7></a> This is the calling of every believer; but there is a great difference between right and enjoyment.<a name=151:8></a> If you have not right you are not quickened.<a name=151:9></a> It has done much mischief to souls to be satisfied with the assurance of right without entering into what the right confers; like a man of great rank, an exiled prince, very great in his position, but without property to support it.<a name=151:10></a> The Christian has always the means to support his position if he will use them.<a name=151:11></a> There is the condition of the "holy priesthood", and you must be in that condition to enjoy the sanctuary.<a name=151:12></a> You enter in the fragrance of the High Priest.<a name=151:13></a> The fragrance of the High Priest is common to each one of the consecrated company.<a name=151:14></a>

		The next thing I must try to explain is, the organisation in "My assembly".<a name=151:15></a> Turn to <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:13">1 Corinthians  12:13</a>, "By One Spirit are we all baptised into one body".<a name=151:16></a> Now, if you study the epistle to the Corinthians, you will see the apostle is speaking of the house to chapter 10.<a name=151:17></a> The house is visible.<a name=151:18></a> The body of Christ is only known to faith.<a name=151:19></a> It is a mystery.<a name=151:20></a> When you speak of a body of Christians, that is not the church.<a name=151:21></a> If a stranger comes into the assembly and he finds it well ordered, he might ask, What is the

	<div class="paragraph">
		organisation here?<a name=152:1></a> I saw no disorder, and yet there was no visible organisation; who ordered?<a name=152:2></a> Well, this verse shows the organisation.<a name=152:3></a> It is one body, and the apostle is showing what the assembly is when in function, every member of the body co-operating.<a name=152:4></a> I am now speaking of "My assembly", what the Lord builds.<a name=152:5></a> Here you have the organisation -- all baptised by one Spirit into one body, and the smallest disturbance affects the whole; there is not a spiritual person in the room who does not know it.<a name=152:6></a> An unconverted person cannot disturb the organisation, though he may disturb the meeting; but if "one <i>member</i>  suffer, all the members suffer with it".<a name=152:7></a> You say, Would not that apply to you when at home?<a name=152:8></a> I believe it would, but that is not the point here.<a name=152:9></a> The point here is, that the assembly is in function.<a name=152:10></a> I trust you will bear in mind what I say, and examine it.<a name=152:11></a> "I speak as to wise men, judge ye what I say".<a name=152:12></a> Man does not know how the organisation is carried out, but he is often convinced when it is done right.<a name=152:13></a> I do not say that there is no disturbance, but the Spirit, if there be simple dependence on Christ, will carry you over it, just as, if an obstacle were thrown in the way of a stream, it would be checked for the moment, but would eventually flow over it.<a name=152:14></a> I will give you one scripture as an illustration; <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#31">Proverbs  31</a>.<a name=152:15></a> The wise woman keeps the house.<a name=152:16></a> The wise woman is the organisation; as long as she was in vigour and health she kept the house well.<a name=152:17></a> Surely if the body of Christ had been true to itself it would have kept the house in order.<a name=152:18></a> If I walk into the house of a wise woman I see that it is well kept.<a name=152:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there were two things which marked the wise woman.<a name=152:20></a> One she fed her household, and the other she clothed them.<a name=152:21></a> This answers to what is said of our Lord, "No man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church".<a name=152:22></a> Thus edification should be found in the assembly -- there should be the nourishing and the

		cherishing for those who come.<a name=153:1></a> Even if a stranger come into the assembly, he should hear the word of God there, and "the secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14:25">1 Corinthians  14:25</a>.<a name=153:2></a> It is not that he knew that the Spirit of God was there, or that the Lord was there; no, he had not faith, but the ministry of the word is so effective that he falls down and reports that "God is in you of a truth".<a name=153:3></a> It does not say even that he is converted, but he is made sensible of the wonderful power in the assembly.<a name=153:4></a> Thus the Lord uses the man speaking by the Spirit of God in the assembly to arrest the stranger.<a name=153:5></a> In the habitation of God through the Spirit, a stranger even is made sensible of the power of God.<a name=153:6></a>

		No one has the right to take part but under the sanction of the Lord.<a name=153:7></a> It is not because there is a pause, or because it is on your heart, that you give out a hymn, or read a scripture, No, but because you have faith in the Lord that it is His pleasure.<a name=153:8></a> What is so interesting in this scripture (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>) is, that the assembly is in function.<a name=153:9></a> When we come together we find Him in the midst.<a name=153:10></a> He is the Head of the body, and each individual is subject to Him.<a name=153:11></a> Then there is the responsibility.<a name=153:12></a> Every privilege has its responsibility.<a name=153:13></a> I turn to <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5:7">1 Corinthians  5:7</a>: "Purge out, therefore, the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened".<a name=153:14></a> I do not pursue it, but every man, woman and child in the assembly is responsible.<a name=153:15></a> You may not be able to remove the evil you see, but you must not let it slip by; you must look for someone competent.<a name=153:16></a> In <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#5:14">1 Thessalonians  5:14</a>, the whole assembly is addressed, not merely the preachers.<a name=153:17></a> No one who has a sense of the blessedness of God's house but will say, I cannot have anything unsuited to my Lord.<a name=153:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Finally, I bring before you an important thing connected with the house, which I see in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>.<a name=154:2></a> The Lord says, "As my Father hath sent me, even so send I you".<a name=154:3></a> My impression is that the servant is actually sent from the assembly.<a name=154:4></a> In the Jewish system there were no missionaries.<a name=154:5></a> The land and the nation defined the limits of their services.<a name=154:6></a> Now you get in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>"As my Father hath sent me, even so send I you"- missionaries.<a name=154:7></a> Each one has a mission, and I believe that if each one was occupied with Christ's interests in the assembly he would learn his mission.<a name=154:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In closing I would ask you to bear in mind <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3:15">1 Timothy  3:15</a>, the object of the assembly on the earth.<a name=154:9></a> The assembly is the pillar and base of the truth.<a name=154:10></a> Look at a clock.<a name=154:11></a> You may not know its organisation, but you see what the time of day is; the clock was made for this.<a name=154:12></a> Like the clock at Greenwich, it tells the time to the whole country.<a name=154:13></a> Now the church should be, in like manner, the pillar and the base of the truth.<a name=154:14></a> A child could not understand the organisation of the clock, but if the organisation is damaged the time of day will not be given correctly.<a name=154:15></a> And it is thus with the assembly, so internally distracted it is imperfectly the pillar and the base of the truth.<a name=154:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is one thing more I have to say on this: "That thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God".<a name=154:17></a> This does not mean simply when Timothy was in the house assembled, but wherever he was he belonged to the house of God, a living stone, a constituent part of Christ's assembly.<a name=154:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will just enumerate the points in their order.<a name=154:19></a> First, the origin of the assembly; secondly, the material of the structure thirdly, the habitation of God through the Spirit fourthly, the sanctuary is there; fifthly, the character of the company who enjoy

		CHRIST THE HEAD OF HIS BODY
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God", <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:19">Colossians  2:19</a>.<a name=156:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The subject I desire to bring before you this evening is Christ, the Head of His body.<a name=156:2></a> Now while in Ephesians you get the whole structure, what is called there "the Christ", so that one who apprehended it would have apprehended the whole, still it is of immense importance to understand Colossians.<a name=156:3></a> The epistle to the Colossians is of deep interest, because there we learn the Head, and thus are preserved from the effort of the enemy to give the flesh a place in connection with Christ.<a name=156:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not doubt that many have learned the doctrine of the Ephesians; those who are well instructed have learnt the unity of the body, that we are all one; but the practical defect in their soul is, that they are not holding the Head.<a name=156:5></a> In the Corinthians you get nothing that I know of as relating to the Head save one passage, "So also is the Christ", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:12">1 Corinthians  12:12</a>.<a name=156:6></a> You get the unity of the body, which I have already spoken of, as the organisation in the house.<a name=156:7></a> If one goes into the house of God, if he sees things in any order, then he imagines there is a prearrangement; but there is no prearrangement.<a name=156:8></a> There is a divine organisation which is not visible, and it is a great thing for a soul to lay hold of this -- that divine power is not visible.<a name=156:9></a> The effort of the enemy is to lead you astray by something visible.<a name=156:10></a> Divine power is invisible except to faith, and faith sees it.<a name=156:11></a> If you take into account the rejection of our Lord here, how could you expect any divine gift to be visible?<a name=156:12></a> The miracles and the gifts of tongues were visible at the beginning to confirm the grace proclaimed; now, the greatest manifestation is

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now let us turn to the epistle, which I will divide into sections, so that you may find it easier to understand.<a name=157:11></a> The fourth verse of the first chapter tells us what their state was: "Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have to all the saints".<a name=157:12></a> That was their state.<a name=157:13></a> Look at the advance they had made, and yet they were in danger.<a name=157:14></a> The Colossians are described as having "faith in Christ Jesus".<a name=157:15></a> Every believer has faith in God, but this is faith in the Man that is now in heaven; as the Lord said, "Ye believe in God, believe also in me".<a name=157:16></a> Their faith was not resting on anything short of Christ in heaven.<a name=157:17></a> Next the apostle prays for them.<a name=157:18></a> It is of great importance to apprehend the first thing necessary for souls who had advanced as far as the Colossians.<a name=157:19></a> Well, his prayer for them is, "For [or according to] the hope which is laid up for you in heaven".<a name=157:20></a>

		Now let me try to bring this before you in its singular importance -- "The hope which is laid up for you in heaven".<a name=158:1></a> No one is saved now for earth; you could not be saved for the place where Christ is rejected.<a name=158:2></a> You are saved for heaven.<a name=158:3></a> That is not connected with the church, but with the gospel.<a name=158:4></a> The Father's house is the home of the prodigal; you are saved for heaven.<a name=158:5></a> And mark, he prays for them according to this hope, because if they are not kept connected with heaven and as belonging to it, he never will be able to lead them into the position which they are to occupy as belonging to that place.<a name=158:6></a> You will see, as we go on, how important it is.<a name=158:7></a> The point that is pressed is that heaven is their place, not earth, because the very moment you accept a new place you will regard everything with reference to that place.<a name=158:8></a> If a Christian would plead for any fascination here, I should say, Would you expect it in heaven?<a name=158:9></a> No; it would not be compatible.<a name=158:10></a> Exactly.<a name=158:11></a> So that the moment a man is set upon heaven, he knows very well that his tastes must accord with that place.<a name=158:12></a> The natural man would not find a home in heaven, because the natural man is of the earth.<a name=158:13></a> "He that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth".<a name=158:14></a> Man was made for earth, and heaven would not suit him at all; you must be a new man to enjoy heaven.<a name=158:15></a> I never knew a departure from the truth by an enlightened soul, but the first thing given up was the heavenly position.<a name=158:16></a> Everything <i>for</i>  Christ depends on retaining it.<a name=158:17></a> The hope of the church is the coming of the Lord, but the hope of the gospel is heaven.<a name=158:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The next begins at verse 15.<a name=158:21></a> It does not relate to us.<a name=158:22></a> It is simply a description of Him who is the Head, and the more you dwell on that description, the more your heart will bow before Him.<a name=158:23></a> "Who is the image

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next section is from verse 20 to the end of the chapter, and I will describe it, though I cannot go into it in detail.<a name=159:6></a> The point of it is how the truth is ministered.<a name=159:7></a> There are two ministries -- one in verse 23 -- "If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel" -- (note how he brings in that again) -- "which ye have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister".<a name=159:8></a> That is one of the ministries -- the gospel -- that is universal; it is "to every creature under heaven".<a name=159:9></a> But there is another ministry (verse 24): "Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church: whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God; even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints: to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory".<a name=159:10></a> He dwells long upon the second; they had learnt the ministry of the gospel, and all he would keep them up to is the hope of the gospel; as we say (it is almost a children's rhyme), "Heaven is our home".<a name=159:11></a> We belong to

		The apostle here refers to what took place in the garden of Eden.<a name=172:4></a> The fullest expression of God's care for man is the fullest type of Christ and the church.<a name=172:5></a> There is no type that I know of at all commensurate with it.<a name=172:6></a> It is one of peculiar significance, hence it is brought in here; "This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church".<a name=172:7></a> Mark how it arrests our attention.<a name=172:8></a> At the very start, when everything was according to God's pleasure on this earth, when there was nothing discordant, when God saw everything that He had made, "Behold, it was very good".<a name=172:9></a> It is important to apprehend the order of things at the moment.<a name=172:10></a> As it is expressed in Genesis, a rib was taken from Adam whereof He builded a woman, and when God brought her to Adam, he said (I quote the original), "She shall be called Isha, because she was taken out of Ish".<a name=172:11></a> (The great point of the quotation in Ephesians is to show that Eve was taken out of man.<a name=172:12></a>) This was when everything was beautiful and in order upon earth.<a name=172:13></a> A much greater thing is now on the earth, when everything in it is in the greatest possible disorganisation.<a name=172:14></a> It is not that everything is not very good, but everything is spoiled and corrupted.<a name=172:15></a> As we read in the Revelation, though it has not yet come out in its full deadly character, the sea and the rivers (the springs that furnish society), all the sources are corrupted.<a name=172:16></a> You are not surprised in that moment of beautiful perfection in the garden of Eden to see Adam and Eve in this consummation of happiness.<a name=172:17></a> But our hearts ought to be sensible that

		we have a much greater happiness now upon the earth than was in the garden of Eden.<a name=173:1></a> I need hardly say, immensely greater.<a name=173:2></a> What was typified then is set forth (Ephesians) in divine fulness.<a name=173:3></a> This One, who is greater than Adam, and sitting at God's right hand, can call the saints, "members of his body".<a name=173:4></a> The Lord lead us to apprehend it.<a name=173:5></a> To think that here on this earth, amid all the misrule and alienation from God, we can say, Christ has the joy of His heart, He has His helpmeet here!<a name=173:6></a> The church is not yet in heaven; it is here on the earth, in the midst of this terrible confusion and moral degradation.<a name=173:7></a> This in itself is a wonderful thing.<a name=173:8></a> Hereafter, when the church comes to the earth in its fulness, as the bride, it will be fully in its administrative character as the holy city coming down out of heaven from God.<a name=173:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing I call your attention to is the origin of this beautiful thing, the church -- it is a great thing to understand its origin.<a name=173:10></a> I have on a former occasion dwelt upon the origin of the house, which was connected with our Lord's rejection on the earth.<a name=173:11></a> When John the baptist was beheaded, then He educated His disciples, as you find in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#14">Matthew  14</a>- 16, for that new structure which, He said, I will build, and which all the powers of hell cannot prevail against; as you get in the last verse of the second chapter of Ephesians: "Ye also are builded together for an habitation of God [by or] through the Spirit".<a name=173:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In order to see the origin of the body of Christ (for at first it was a secret hid in the heart of God, and never divulged until the appointed time, therefore the occasion on which it was divulged characterises its origin), see <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#22:44">Matthew  22:44</a>: "The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool".<a name=173:13></a> Here it is stated that the Lord is called away from the earth to sit in the highest place.<a name=173:14></a> It is not simply that He has been rejected by His own -- that I have already alluded to, the house

	<div class="paragraph">
		I am conducting you now to the other aspect of the assembly.<a name=174:3></a> I tried to explain on a former occasion that the body is the organisation in the house.<a name=174:4></a> A stranger walks into the house and, after the meeting, says, You have had everything nicely arranged, of course you settled it all beforehand.<a name=174:5></a> I say, No, we did not settle anything beforehand.<a name=174:6></a> You have a good organisation.<a name=174:7></a> Yes, we have; but it is an invisible one, unknown except to faith.<a name=174:8></a> It is the body, as described in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>.<a name=174:9></a> But you must not confound the body with the house.<a name=174:10></a> A stranger walks into the house.<a name=174:11></a> And we know one may be in the house though not in the body.<a name=174:12></a> The vital thing in the house is the body.<a name=174:13></a>

		I want to confine your attention this evening to the assembly as we get it in Ephesians, that is, "the Christ".<a name=174:14></a> I turn to <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#22:44">Matthew  22:44</a> to show that Christ has left the earth, and I address myself to every conscientious believer, and say, How are you on the earth, then, if He is not here?<a name=174:15></a> You see, I propose a question which to any true-hearted soul would be a very serious one.<a name=174:16></a> And I have no doubt that the answer to it is a crisis in every believer's history.<a name=174:17></a> The answer is, I belong to Him where He is.<a name=174:18></a> Well, then, where is He?<a name=174:19></a> That is answered in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3:1">Colossians  3:1</a>: "If Ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, <i>where Christ sitteth</i> ".<a name=174:20></a> This is not so much a matter of the conscience.<a name=174:21></a> The conscience wants rest and freedom from judgement.<a name=174:22></a> This relates to the heart.<a name=174:23></a> My heart seeks the company of Him who saved me.<a name=174:24></a> You may say, Oh, we are saved and we are happy.<a name=174:25></a>

		I turn to two passages more, one in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7:55">Acts  7:55</a>.<a name=175:8></a> Here I get a remarkable thing: though union with, Christ was not yet disclosed, yet you get here the energy of the Holy Spirit, and that, although we are upon earth, we are not disconnected from Christ who is in heaven: "He, being full of the Holy Spirit, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus".<a name=175:9></a> And he says, "I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God".<a name=175:10></a> I adduce this passage in order to show you that the Holy Spirit has come down from the rejected Christ now exalted to the highest place in heaven, to maintain for Him here.<a name=175:11></a> A power equal to Himself is upon the earth, though invisible.<a name=175:12></a> He who was the Light is rejected, and now He sends from the Father the Holy Spirit to testify of Him.<a name=175:13></a> The Holy Spirit is invisible to the world, He is only known to faith; He connects me with Christ where He is.<a name=175:14></a>

		Another thing I want to establish is, that we are the body of Christ on the earth.<a name=176:7></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:4">Acts  9:4</a>: "And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?<a name=176:8></a>" Now for the first time was divulged the secret that the saints on earth are "the Christ".<a name=176:9></a> That is the word all through the Ephesians, as well as I remember; "the Christ" means Himself.<a name=176:10></a> It is not a question of two parts, it is one great whole; you do not add anything to Him.<a name=176:11></a> Some say, There are a great many Christians not born yet.<a name=176:12></a> Well, as in a bird, the feathers have not come out yet; but they are all in the bird, and when they do come out, they come out from the bird, it is not that they are added to it, but they grow out of the bird.<a name=176:13></a> We are quickened together with Him.<a name=176:14></a> All comes from Him, just as the rib was taken out of Adam, and the type is but a shadow of the reality.<a name=176:15></a> The great lack in those who profess to understand the mystery of the body is, they do not see that it is a part of Christ Himself: "We are members of his body".<a name=176:16></a> It is not something I add to Him, but something I derive from Him.<a name=176:17></a> I derive my membership from Him.<a name=176:18></a>

		This fourth verse is the first time it is divulged.<a name=176:19></a> It is divulged to Saul of Tarsus, and to him this great truth was committed.<a name=176:20></a> He was persecuting the saints to the death, and now is disclosed for the first time that the saints whom he was persecuting were Christ Himself.<a name=176:21></a> "Why persecutest thou ME?<a name=176:22></a>" It does not say 'mine', but "ME".<a name=176:23></a> Hence the apostle says (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:12">1 Corinthians  12:12</a>), "For as the body is one, and hath many

		God's counsel, which had been hid from the foundation of the world, is that His body should be here.<a name=178:1></a> You may say you do not see it; you may say it is greatly demoralised.<a name=178:2></a> It is disorganised if you like, but it is here; there is not a member of it wanting, though the expression of it is not maintained.<a name=178:3></a> But His body is on this earth where He has been rejected: "By one Spirit are we all baptised into one body".<a name=178:4></a> How indifferently each member acts in relation to that fact is but too true!<a name=178:5></a> I need not say, beloved friends, how thoroughly we have all failed.<a name=178:6></a> But still, the failure is not on God's side, the failure is on man's side, and all I insist upon is that the body is here.<a name=178:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I take a little view of the epistle to the Ephesians, and I give you a summary of it, to establish distinctly what I have already asserted.<a name=178:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first section goes down to the end of the fourteenth verse of the first chapter.<a name=178:9></a> It comprises a very important point, and that is, that we are brought by divine grace into similarity with our Lord Jesus Christ as to relationship and inheritance; no union yet.<a name=178:10></a> I am anxious you should understand that these first fourteen verses are all individual.<a name=178:11></a> It is all to show what we are brought to.<a name=178:12></a> For instance, this one verse gives you an idea of it, "Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will".<a name=178:13></a> That is individual.<a name=178:14></a> You may understand it better if I state it in another way, and as I get it in Hebrews -- I am fit to be His companion.<a name=178:15></a> That is a very important truth for the soul to be clear about.<a name=178:16></a> You do not get a word about union in Hebrews that I know of; you get the church spoken of once; but what you get is, that He is anointed with the oil of gladness above His companions (that is the meaning also of the word 'partaker').<a name=178:17></a> "Both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one"; but that is not union.<a name=178:18></a> If I am not fit to be His companion, how could I be happy

		with Him, or He with me?<a name=179:1></a> How could there be for ever and ever a bond which never could be broken?<a name=179:2></a> You see it must be so.<a name=179:3></a> Hence the first fourteen verses of this epistle in which "the Christ" is described, carefully set forth and group together the wonderful position we hold individually.<a name=179:4></a> Just as I might describe how Sarah was as to rank similar to Abraham; before marriage took place she was quite qualified to be his companion, her lineage was the same as his; but by marriage her position only was advanced.<a name=179:5></a> That is the first section.<a name=179:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now look at the next section, from the fifteenth verse to the end of the chapter; that is counsel, that is what we are called to.<a name=179:7></a> The apostle prays that the Spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him may be given, that the eyes of our hearts might be enlightened, that we might understand what God's calling is.<a name=179:8></a> And not only the calling, because in one sense that is future, and it is all future as to its completion but the nineteenth verse is that you should know now "what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ".<a name=179:9></a> We are all members of Christ's body.<a name=179:10></a> As I said before about the bird, every feather in that bird comes from the bird, it is in the bird.<a name=179:11></a> And that explains a great deal that happens now, because in that sense the plumage is here.<a name=179:12></a> And would to God it was more practically so of us; that is, that each of us set forth here the beauty of the exalted Christ in the very scene of His rejections What a wonderful sight it would be, beloved friends!<a name=179:13></a> And we may indeed hang down our heads and be depressed in heart that it is not so.<a name=179:14></a> If in Israel they mourned that the temple was not according to what it was, how much more should we mourn that the exalted Christ is not better described here.<a name=179:15></a> This is our testimony on whom the ends of the ages are come; and therefore it is now the fullest expression

		The second chapter is a section in itself, as I understand.<a name=180:19></a> It is the vocation.<a name=180:20></a> There are seven parts in it.<a name=180:21></a> You begin with heaven, you are seated in heaven, you are a new creation.<a name=180:22></a> I must turn to the fifteenth verse, because it explains a great deal of what is defective in Christendom; "Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace".<a name=180:23></a> Our brethren in Christendom do not know how Jew and Gentile could worship together.<a name=180:24></a> There is a great deal of confusion and darkness abroad on this point: that is, how Jews and Gentiles were to be put upon common ground

		Then we take our place with Him here.<a name=196:4></a> We are not only looking for a glorious body, but we shall be like Him, and see Him; the marriage of the Lamb is come, the bride has made herself ready in heaven, and now we are to be in perfect administration for Him on the earth.<a name=196:5></a> Now the day begins.<a name=196:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us now briefly look at these seven traits, for as we anticipate our future, we are instructed as to our present.<a name=196:7></a> The first trait is light.<a name=196:8></a> The holy Jerusalem descends out of heaven from God, having the glory of God: and her light like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal.<a name=196:9></a> It is evident that we ought to be the light now.<a name=196:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next is "walls".<a name=196:11></a> I can only give an outline of the picture for your anticipation; the effect of such an anticipation is that you are ordering your life now on earth with reference to it.<a name=196:12></a> What do you anticipate?<a name=196:13></a> What do you look for?<a name=196:14></a> The first thing is the light most precious, a jasper stone, the Lord Himself.<a name=196:15></a> The second, "walls", they are not only protective, but exclusive.<a name=196:16></a> It says in verse 27, "And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie; but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life".<a name=196:17></a> Everything is excluded that is not fit for the Lord; that is the principle of the assembly now.<a name=196:18></a> "Holiness becometh thy house, O Lord, for ever".<a name=196:19></a>

		Now I trust further on to be able to show you that, when the Lord was rejected here, He said, I will have My assembly (mark the word 'my') I lay great stress upon the word 'my'.<a name=205:5></a> That gives it all its character.<a name=205:6></a> How could it be His assembly if He were not there?<a name=205:7></a> "The assembly of the living God", it is called in another place; "living", I believe, because He is there in His activity.<a name=205:8></a> And that assembly will be an impregnable fortress upon the earth.<a name=205:9></a> Some will tell you it is all broken up; but His assembly is impregnable; it is very plain and very strong language, but there it is, it is impregnable, "The gates of hell shall not prevail against it".<a name=205:10></a> That is not in heaven at all, it is on earth.<a name=205:11></a> And, therefore, when He speaks of all the evil in this world, speaking of how the kingdom of heaven fails here among men, He says, My treasure is there.<a name=205:12></a> I only allude to that to show, that at no moment in the history of the church, though you may speak of its being dismantled, and of its carved work being broken down with axes and hammers, yet you never can set aside the fact, that the power of the Lord is connected with it, that He abides faithful.<a name=205:13></a> You may not abide faithful, that is very likely, a great many have not, but He does.<a name=205:14></a> That is a great matter.<a name=205:15></a> Where was the breakdown in Israel?<a name=205:16></a> With Aaron and his sons.<a name=205:17></a> Where?<a name=205:18></a> just as they were going into the holiest; in the very brightest spot.<a name=205:19></a> And what then?<a name=205:20></a> Aaron's sons were reduced to two; but they had the high priest with them, and though reduced to two, we may have the Lord; we have still the One who will stand by His own and maintain His own according to His pleasure, while the assembly is

		The next characteristic that I desire to bring before you, will very easily occur to you, it is a larger one than any I have named.<a name=215:4></a> We have His actual presence, and the first thing is you find there is not a cloud.<a name=215:5></a> He has now made you sensible there is not a shade between Him and you.<a name=215:6></a> He has removed all Himself, and you are delighted.<a name=215:7></a> Well then, you are beside yourself.<a name=215:8></a> And then you worship.<a name=215:9></a> Now what next?<a name=215:10></a> The sixth characteristic or effect of His presence is that you are edified.<a name=215:11></a> Now I think this very important, because I see some who read the Bible a great deal, but with no result.<a name=215:12></a> They enjoy the word greatly, but they are not edified.<a name=215:13></a> I do not think anything edifies but the Lord Himself.<a name=215:14></a> I will give you a very simple scripture for it -- <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24">Luke  24</a>.<a name=215:15></a> Familiar passages always help much.<a name=215:16></a> The better you know a scripture, the more it yields you.<a name=215:17></a> The greatest exposition that ever was, the two disciples listened to, and you would expect great results from it.<a name=215:18></a> No.<a name=215:19></a> Only their hearts burned within them; it did not produce any change in their course, they said, It is too late to go any farther, and they asked Him in.<a name=215:20></a> He went in, and He was known to them in breaking of bread, it was the figure of His own death, a fitting opportunity for Him to reveal Himself, and what then?<a name=215:21></a> They must go to Jerusalem -- eight miles off, though it was too late to go any farther a few minutes ago.<a name=215:22></a> "And they rose up the same hour and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them".<a name=215:23></a> See, what an effect!<a name=215:24></a> Mark, that same hour they rose up and returned to Jerusalem, and what had produced it?<a name=215:25></a> His presence!<a name=215:26></a> The impression I have is, that if one only reads the word and one does not realise the presence of the Lord, he is like one with plenty of ore; silver, or gold, or whatever it is, he does not know what to do with it, he has no mould.<a name=215:27></a>

		One might say, I was at the meeting, and there was not much said, but I really found the Lord there and I gained much from His presence -- that is edification.<a name=216:15></a> Edification is building up; any builder would say, to add brick to brick.<a name=216:16></a> Love edifies.<a name=216:17></a> Knowledge puffs up.<a name=216:18></a> I have no doubt you were eating of the corn of the land.<a name=216:19></a> How could you be in His company, and not be affected by it?<a name=216:20></a> What is moral weight?<a name=216:21></a> A man who is really walking with the Lord, if he comes into your room, you know he has an effect upon you, and he is only a reflection of the Lord's glory.<a name=216:22></a> It is like the moon's light from the sun.<a name=216:23></a> The Lord chooses His servants to minister.<a name=216:24></a> It is not simply the word uttered that edifies, many a soul is edified without ministry.<a name=216:25></a> It is not that I make little of ministry, because I have no doubt that ministry produces an effect; the secrets of the heart are made manifest.<a name=216:26></a> But what I dwell on is that, if a person enjoys the presence of Christ, he does not leave the room as he came into it; he is edified, he has acquired something of Christ.<a name=216:27></a> Like those two disciples going to Emmaus,

		The seventh characteristic is, where the presence of the Lord is, there is power.<a name=217:13></a> There are plenty of insubordinate spirits, and you always find that the bad spirits are always ready to help any bad spirit, but they are kept in check.<a name=217:14></a> How?<a name=217:15></a> The Lord's presence kept them silent.<a name=217:16></a> I have seen it in discipline meetings, they will often talk wildly after a meeting is over, but why did they not talk while it was going on?<a name=217:17></a> They could not.<a name=217:18></a> The power of the Lord's presence held them in check, and you could not have His presence without it.<a name=217:19></a> What I insist on is -- the actuality of His presence.<a name=217:20></a>

		The subject I desire to bring before you this evening is, The character of the company to whom the Lord vouchsafes His presence -- even two or three, though there be others present not gathered to His name, though professing to be.<a name=218:2></a> I think you will find as I proceed that such do not enjoy His presence.<a name=218:3></a> It is distinctly stated in Scripture, of the sons of Aaron, though they had a common right (we are all of that order now), yet some of them did not enjoy the presence -- "shall not go in unto the veil" -- though they were fed; <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#21:21">Leviticus  21:21</a> - 23.<a name=218:4></a> That will come out farther on.<a name=218:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I say, beloved friends, and I desire to feel it, and I trust you all will feel it, that a great responsibility rests upon us to set forth the reality.<a name=219:2></a> I do not speak of a responsibility that we are not able to meet.<a name=219:3></a> That was the responsibility under the law.<a name=219:4></a> The responsibility of a Christian is a responsibility which he is able to meet.<a name=219:5></a> There is no responsibility now that is not in keeping with a privilege.<a name=219:6></a> If you fail in your responsibility, you have not acted up to your privilege.<a name=219:7></a> The law disclosed the inability in man to accomplish its commands.<a name=219:8></a> The responsibilities or injunctions that are given to us, are actually to manifest the power that is given to us.<a name=219:9></a> I have been much interested and greatly affected by the amazing character of the condition we are called to.<a name=219:10></a> I read this verse in Peter -- it is only a little part of it -- but mark the words, the "holy priesthood", that is the company -- a holy priesthood, that expresses the condition, the character of the company who are entitled to enjoy His presence.<a name=219:11></a>

		I turn first to <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>, because it brings out the character of the company, for if you do not know the character of the company, you do not know how to preserve it, and if you do not know how to preserve it, you certainly do not know its character.<a name=219:12></a> The first thing I dwell upon is the company, the constitution of it.<a name=219:13></a> <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:18">Matthew  16:18</a>: "I say unto thee, That thou art Peter (a stone), and upon this rock I will build my church".<a name=219:14></a> There it is His own building, mind you.<a name=219:15></a> That you will all admit; and that is in keeping with the passage I have read: "Lively" or "living stones".<a name=219:16></a> Peter tells us what the actual nature of that building is.<a name=219:17></a> I trust you will see how definite and exclusive the company is.<a name=219:18></a> I know some of you might shrink from the word 'exclusive', but the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now to show the beginning or foundation of this condition, I turn to <a href="../bible/John.htm#13:8">John  13:8</a>; "Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me".<a name=220:3></a> That was an entirely new and strange notion to His disciples.<a name=220:4></a> Here they were touching Him, John just leaning on His breast, and now He tells them all is changed, and they cannot come near Him unless they are washed.<a name=220:5></a> Hence in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#7:26">Hebrews  7:26</a> we read: "For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens".<a name=220:6></a> Separated, not separate.<a name=220:7></a> He was separate from sinners when down here.<a name=220:8></a> All is now of heavenly order, not a bit of the earthly enters there, nothing of the first man; all that is gone, all that is new has come in.<a name=220:9></a> It is the fulfilment of <a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#5">Joshua  5</a>.<a name=220:10></a> Now we have to do with the true.<a name=220:11></a> He is a minister of the holy places, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.<a name=220:12></a> Hence to enjoy His presence, the Minister of the holy places, we must be in the holy places with Him.<a name=220:13></a> What a wonderfully sanctified company then we are!<a name=220:14></a> Wonderful indeed!<a name=220:15></a>

		It is not merely that you are saved; but that there is not a shade between Him and you.<a name=220:16></a> I said on the former occasion that the very first thing that marks the enjoyment of His presence, the first characteristic is, that there is not a cloud there, and then I enjoy His presence.<a name=220:17></a> Hence, without separation, you could not enjoy His presence, you are not one of those who are gathered to His name.<a name=220:18></a> You may say, there are a great many then who are not.<a name=220:19></a> Well, I admit that is possible; but it is a relief to one's mind, that though they are not there in company with Himself; that is, that they do not go in unto the veil, yet they are fed:

		I will now dwell on the positive side of this truth.<a name=221:12></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:19">John  20:19</a>, I get the pattern of the assembly, of the company.<a name=221:13></a> In this verse 19, they are gathered, and the doors are shut, and the Lord stands in the midst.<a name=221:14></a> As someone has said, They were gathered by the Lord's message through Mary Magdalene; certainly we know they were there, and that He came into the midst and said, "Peace be unto you".<a name=221:15></a> That is introductory; but still it gives you this idea, the condition of the company to whom He comes.<a name=221:16></a> He fits them for His presence.<a name=221:17></a> I am looking at the assembly as at the beginning.<a name=221:18></a> It may be reduced to the two or three; just as Aaron was reduced to only two sons.<a name=221:19></a> Every believer is a priest now, we are constituted the holy priesthood.<a name=221:20></a> Christendom, to escape this responsibility, has divided the saints into two classes, the priests and the laymen.<a name=221:21></a> There is no distinction in the New Testament; that is the reason

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is nothing more important to keep definitely before the mind than the condition of the company who enjoyed His presence, because if not complied with they do not have it.<a name=222:7></a> Therefore the Lord limits it to the smallest company you could find; still, what is right for two or three is right for all.<a name=222:8></a> Peter does not say for two or three, but the whole company, "Built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices".<a name=222:9></a> That is what characterises the assembly.<a name=222:10></a> I am anxious for you to get hold of this.<a name=222:11></a> Each person is fit for His presence.<a name=222:12></a> I have already tried to show that His presence necessarily required fitness, and you cannot be too distinct about it.<a name=222:13></a> We see in the type, how Rebecca, when she saw Isaac, made herself ready.<a name=222:14></a> I think we have not thought enough about it.<a name=222:15></a> A person may say, Shall I not get good in the assembly if I am not fit?<a name=222:16></a> I do not say you will not; but what I maintain is, you cannot enjoy His presence unless you are in trim for it: it would be impossible.<a name=222:17></a> "She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework".<a name=222:18></a> There must be suitability for the Lord's presence.<a name=222:19></a> He could not manifest Himself if there were not suitability.<a name=222:20></a> Hence it is conditional.<a name=222:21></a> "Where two or three are gathered together to my name".<a name=222:22></a> I do not limit it to the two or three, but if you are not up to this, you are not in your proper place as a living stone.<a name=222:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now turn to one or two passages in the Old Testament.<a name=223:9></a> It is a great thing to get the principle for any action, because if I have the principle, I am sure to get it established.<a name=223:10></a> We have seen the character of the company to whom the Lord vouchsafes His presence, it is not only that He promises it, but He is there: "Where two or three are gathered together to my name, there am I".<a name=223:11></a> It is a consequence, He cannot but come there.<a name=223:12></a> If the Holy Spirit gathers, the Lord is there.<a name=223:13></a> The first passage I turn to is <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#5:2">Numbers  5:2</a>: "Command the children of Israel that they put out of the camp every leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever is defiled by the dead; both male and female shall ye put out, without the camp shall ye put them; that they defile not their camps in the midst.<a name=223:14></a> whereof I dwell".<a name=223:15></a> There is a type of the responsibility of the congregation.<a name=223:16></a> And here it is the congregation which is bound to preserve itself fit for the Lord's presence.<a name=223:17></a> I come to that presently; but I call your attention now to the constitution of the assembly.<a name=223:18></a> All the children of Israel formed it, not the priests nor the Levites merely.<a name=223:19></a> Someone has said there were three classes -- the warriors, the servants or labourers, and the worshippers; but still they were all there -- the whole congregation.<a name=223:20></a> It is an immense

		I turn now to the preservation of this company.<a name=227:3></a> Once you have a true sense of the sanctity of the company to whom only His presence would be given, then comes your responsibility to preserve that company holy for the Lord, and the better you understand the sanctity He required, the more zealous assuredly, you will be to keep it fit for the Lord.<a name=227:4></a> The more you value the dignity, the more you will say, I cannot allow anything that would compromise it, nor sanction anything unfit for His presence.<a name=227:5></a> Hence, we have to wash one another's feet.<a name=227:6></a> So we see here in the type, the whole congregation were responsible that there should not be anything unfit for the Lord's presence visible.<a name=227:7></a> The whole congregation are responsible, as I have already read in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#5">Numbers  5</a>.<a name=227:8></a> How responsible?<a name=227:9></a> Well, if you, brother or sister, see a man failing, you are responsible; if you cannot correct him yet you are responsible, and therefore you may ask another; the purpose is to save your brother, and to preserve the company fit for the Lord, for all are responsible.<a name=227:10></a> One with a leprosy, or one with an issue, or defiled by the dead; these were all visible, open to the naked eye; I do not impute motives, I do not insinuate; but if I see you keep bad company, I say I cannot allow it.<a name=227:11></a> And why?<a name=227:12></a> Because the Lord dwells here, therefore the whole are responsible.<a name=227:13></a> If a sister finds that she cannot do it, she can speak to a brother who can: I have found I was not equal to a case, and I have asked another.<a name=227:14></a> Therefore it says, "Ye which are spiritual restore such an one in the spirit of meekness".<a name=227:15></a> The great thing is that it is your responsibility to preserve the company fit for the Lord.<a name=227:16></a> I know very well how naturally we like to see defects in others, because a defect in others may exalt ourselves.<a name=227:17></a> A man

		Now, though all the congregation were responsible to put out the leper, yet the congregation were not to judge if it were leprosy or not, the priest alone was competent for this.<a name=228:6></a> It is a very important point, for it might not be leprosy.<a name=228:7></a> And the first work of the priest is, that he does not assume that an offender is incorrigible.<a name=228:8></a> I do not say that he may not prove incorrigible.<a name=228:9></a> But if you watch the history of a soul, you will find he is not incorrigible at the beginning.<a name=228:10></a> Take any departure you like: for instance, light reading, which is a very injurious thing; or anything where the affections are engaged, what Scripture calls covetousness, an uncontrolled desire to possess.<a name=228:11></a> I may see a person carried away, but as long as the conscience is sensible that it is wrong, even though there be a return to it, there is hope for that soul.<a name=228:12></a> But when the act is committed, the conscience is overborne, the man is under an evil power, it is the work of the devil.<a name=228:13></a> The duty of the priest therefore was to see whether the offender had become incorrigible, then it was

		The subject I desire to bring before you tonight is -- The effect that the knowledge of the Lord's presence in the assembly has upon us in private life; the outside, as the result of the wonderful place we have inside.<a name=236:1></a> Inside we are priests of God, and thus are fit for the presence of the Lord in moral correspondence with Himself enjoying His presence.<a name=236:2></a> All are called to this, and all are provided with the priestly dress, though I do not know that everyone wears it; still, every one is provided by divine grace with a priestly dress as much as with his salvation.<a name=236:3></a> When we are soiled outside, in this world, He washes our feet that we may have part with Him where He is.<a name=236:4></a> If you see that all your intimacy with Christ depends on this, that there is no sense of soil upon you, then it necessarily will oblige you that you should not do anything in which you would contract a soil.<a name=236:5></a> And you will always find a person who is most sensible that he is free from soil is the one who is most watchful against it.<a name=236:6></a> The more one is sensible of the cloudless position in which his washed feet place him in company with the Lord, the more he shrinks from everything that would make him lose this great gain.<a name=236:7></a> It is not that one loses the sense of His love; you get that very well exemplified in Peter, in <a href="../bible/John.htm#21">John  21</a>.<a name=236:8></a> Peter had no fear of the Lord; when he heard it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's coat about him and cast himself into the sea to go to Him.<a name=236:9></a> I know Him, he says.<a name=236:10></a> Yes, Peter; but you are not in communion with Him.<a name=236:11></a> People often think, that because they have love for the Lord, they are all right; but love is not communion.<a name=236:12></a> Peter's feet were not washed until after they had dined; then he is restored to communion.<a name=236:13></a> In one sense we

		can never lose what the Lord is to us (that is beautiful in Peter), but we can lose communion.<a name=237:1></a> But I am not showing that now, I merely allude to the necessity of being free from every soil in order to enjoy the Lord's presence: and because you enjoy His presence, you are found separate from everything that would deprive you of the enjoyment of it; not only when you are gathered to His presence, but everywhere.<a name=237:2></a> In one sense, you are never out of His presence.<a name=237:3></a>

		Look at the seven churches in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2">Revelation  2</a>and 3.<a name=288:4></a> John tells you the history of things on the earth, and shows there is no hope but for those in Philadelphia, to whom the Lord, as it were, says, If you have My character, you shall have My power.<a name=288:5></a> "He that is holy, He that is true, He that hath the key of David".<a name=288:6></a> Character and power always go together.<a name=288:7></a> You may be sure you never have power without character.<a name=288:8></a> I do not mean what the world calls character, but I mean separation to God, "holy" and "true".<a name=288:9></a> Then we are like a beautiful streak of light passing through all the dark shadows, and coming out at the close in readiness for the Lord.<a name=288:10></a> Read <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:17">Revelation  22:17</a>: "The Spirit and the bride say, Come".<a name=288:11></a> There is John again.<a name=288:12></a> His love is there.<a name=288:13></a> "The Spirit and the bride say, Come".<a name=288:14></a> Characteristically true of every believer; what characterises all the saints, their calling; you cannot leave out any.<a name=288:15></a> The bride is looking for Him, and attentive to all that concerns Him.<a name=288:16></a> All that concerns Him is of deepest interest to her.<a name=288:17></a> Love delights in the pleasure of its Object.<a name=288:18></a> If you love Me, feed My sheep; shepherd My sheep; feed My lambs.<a name=288:19></a> She is suited to Him, not scrambling to get ready; but she earnestly labours that everything may be according to His pleasure when He does come.<a name=288:20></a> She knows what will suit Him.<a name=288:21></a> If I were not in circumstances fitted for His coming, I could not say, Come.<a name=288:22></a> I would not ask an ordinary friend to come if I were not ready to receive him, how much less the Lord.<a name=288:23></a> The greater the friend, the more I would like to have everything in order to receive him.<a name=288:24></a> May we be "like unto men that wait for their Lord"; not merely talking about it.<a name=288:25></a> You say you

		"Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come", <a href="../bible/John.htm#16:13">John  16:13</a>.<a name=291:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This verse might be more correctly read, "He shall guide you into all the truth".<a name=291:2></a> Well, beloved friends, it is a very humbling subject to us; still it is no less true, that to have the whole truth is one of the marks, one of the accompaniments of knowing the Lord in the midst of His own, gathered together to His name.<a name=291:3></a> For my part I cannot conceive anything more really interesting -- because it is not to angels, but to us that the Holy Spirit makes known the truth: "He shall guide you into all the truth".<a name=291:4></a> If you look into all the sects in Christendom, what you are met with on every hand is, that each assumes to have more truth than its fellows; or at least one particular truth that others have not.<a name=291:5></a> We cannot but see the importance of having all the truth.<a name=291:6></a> And though I am very far from assuming that we have it in its fulness, still I do trust there is the earnest desire after the truth.<a name=291:7></a> The apostle warns Timothy, that the time would come when they would not listen to the truth, but would be turned away to fables.<a name=291:8></a> He speaks of those who were the mischief workers, they "withstand the truth" -- not a truth, but the truth.<a name=291:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I propose to present to you as well as I am able, is what really the truth is.<a name=291:10></a> Because here the Spirit of God, not the church, guides into it; and one of the failures of Christendom is the boast that the church expounds the truth.<a name=291:11></a> No doubt the church has it; all the truth there is, is in the church.<a name=291:12></a> There is a verse in Timothy (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3:15">1 Timothy  3:15</a>), which is not sufficiently borne in mind: "That thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of

	<div class="paragraph">
		The first scripture I will turn to as expressing what the truth is, and which will convey it to you in a very small compass, is <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:23">Colossians  1:23</a> - 25, "If Ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister; who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the

		church: whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God".<a name=293:1></a> There, in very small compass, you get the two ministries connected with the truth -- one is the gospel, and the other is the church.<a name=293:2></a> They are quite distinct.<a name=293:3></a> Where they coalesce is an interesting inquiry; but the point for us, what is to mark us, is that we have these two ministries.<a name=293:4></a> It is not the question whether every person of the company understands them; but the question is, whether they accept them.<a name=293:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I look for an admission of the truth; not that I expect every one of the company to be intelligent as to the truth.<a name=293:6></a> Why were creeds ever brought out?<a name=293:7></a> In order to show what people believed.<a name=293:8></a> I do not want a creed in that formal way; but I want to understand what really belongs to us as belonging to Christ here on earth, because I take the ground that we are in company with Him.<a name=293:9></a> It is not only that I know Him individually.<a name=293:10></a> If you do not know Him in your individual circumstances, you will never know Him in the house of God.<a name=293:11></a> If you have not personal intimacy according to <a href="../bible/John.htm#10">John  10</a>, "I know my sheep, and am known of mine", do not tell me that you know Him in His assembly.<a name=293:12></a> You may know the effect of His presence there, you may get the benefit of His presence, but you do not know Himself there.<a name=293:13></a> He is there in a very full way, as He would not be with an individual.<a name=293:14></a> When He comes to the individual, He comes in relation to the individual; and when He comes to the assembly, He comes in relation to it, as Son over the house of God.<a name=293:15></a> And if you look at Sardis (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3">Revelation  3</a>), I think you will see there, that the great lack is, that they have not been in company with the Lord in the assembly, and therefore they do not get beyond the Reformation.<a name=293:16></a> You see it in Luther; justification by faith, the truth of the gospel revived, but the church only reformed.<a name=293:17></a> If you really were alongside of the

		Next -- if the gospel has not made me fit for Christ, and to be united to Christ, then what does?<a name=295:6></a> Surely union does not fit me.<a name=295:7></a> I am fit by the gospel, and that is the great teaching of the earlier verses of Ephesians.<a name=295:8></a> I am fit for union.<a name=295:9></a> It is like Abraham sending for Rebekah, one of his own family.<a name=295:10></a> And that is what you have in Hebrews: "He that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one".<a name=295:11></a> In Hebrews you get that you are fit to be His companion.<a name=295:12></a> It is a wonderful thing that the gospel gives that.<a name=295:13></a> If you are not fit to be His companion, you could not be united to Him.<a name=295:14></a> He could not be united to what is unsuitable to Himself.<a name=295:15></a> <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>shows that we are "accepted in the beloved", brought really into fitness; as John says, "As he is, so are we in this world".<a name=295:16></a> Through divine grace, I am fit to be His companion.<a name=295:17></a> And now comes out the mystery; We are His body, in the closest relationship to Him.<a name=295:18></a> I do not believe a soul could be in the presence of the Lord in the midst of His own, without the sense that there was a relationship, though he might not be able to explain it, he has not learned the word, the divine authority for it.<a name=295:19></a> Scripture tells you that you are united, a member of His body, and you are entranced; but then you were prepared for this light.<a name=295:20></a> I want you to understand that you could not be much in His presence without growing into a knowledge of the assembly as well as the gospel.<a name=295:21></a>

		These two ministries comprise the truth, because they show not only what the work of Christ has effected, but what our relationship is to Christ, and that for ever.<a name=296:1></a> Not only in this world, but for ever, the assembly will be the medium by which He will convey His pleasure over the whole universe.<a name=296:2></a> Hence you see it is the expression of Himself.<a name=296:3></a> There is no good in anything but Himself.<a name=296:4></a> "As the truth is in Jesus"; that is, the truth was expressed in Him, a man on earth.<a name=296:5></a> A Person was on earth who exposed the false, and declared the true; He was the living impersonation of what is true, and therefore He exposed all that is false.<a name=296:6></a> Hence, God will judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ.<a name=296:7></a> He is "the Truth".<a name=296:8></a> I think I need not say more on these two ministries.<a name=296:9></a> I desire before the Lord that you should dwell upon the whole truth, and my comfort in speaking on this subject -- in one sense a line new to myself is, that I believe the necessity of the time has called it out -- that it is the Lord's will that it should be brought before you.<a name=296:10></a>

		Now I pass on to the practical application, which I may call the test whether you know these two ministries or not.<a name=296:11></a> There are four great events connected with them, and they are in relation to Christ.<a name=296:12></a> The first (there is not one here, I hope, who is not clear about it), that our blessed Lord was on this earth, and that He died and rose again.<a name=296:13></a> The second is that He has been glorified.<a name=296:14></a> The third is that the Holy Spirit has come down from the One who has been glorified.<a name=296:15></a> The fourth is not yet accomplished; it is what we wait for -- the coming of the Lord.<a name=296:16></a> Now by these four events, you may judge the church: you can judge Christendom, you can judge yourself, you can judge every one.<a name=296:17></a>

		It is a great thing to get hold of principles; and the first great principle that I desire to bring before you, as describing true service, is that it is established in righteousness.<a name=307:9></a> We are all the bondmen of Jesus Christ; simply accept that, and it will be a great help to you.<a name=307:10></a> Has Christ the right to you?<a name=307:11></a> to all yours?<a name=307:12></a> Yes; you are His slave.<a name=307:13></a> Paul delights to call himself bondslave.<a name=307:14></a> People in their natural amiability talk of the emancipation of slaves, but they carry it much farther, they emancipate themselves.<a name=307:15></a> There is a very great claim connected with being a slave.<a name=307:16></a> Your master has full right over you.<a name=307:17></a> All yours belongs to the Lord.<a name=307:18></a> If you are a slave, you cannot claim anything for yourself.<a name=307:19></a> Well, this is a great

		principle to get hold of, and you will never understand service till you do.<a name=308:1></a> Very often we act as if we thought we were volunteers, that we may serve or not, just as we please.<a name=308:2></a> Not at all!<a name=308:3></a> you are slaves and have no option.<a name=308:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I shall be able to bring another reason for service presently, but I start with righteousness.<a name=308:5></a> If you are a slave, you have no right to do anything but at the dictation of your master.<a name=308:6></a> "You are bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your body".<a name=308:7></a> He has bought us (therefore He is the Saviour of the body in that sense) and you ought to be glad He has, and the more you dwell on it, the more pleased you will be to be His slave.<a name=308:8></a> It would be a good answer to give to every one who asks, Why do you do so-and-so?<a name=308:9></a> I am doing it righteously, I am Christ's bondman to do His pleasure; not what I like, but what He likes.<a name=308:10></a> That is the first great principle.<a name=308:11></a> To establish this, I turn now to <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#7:22">1 Corinthians  7:22</a>, 23, "He that is called in the Lord, being a servant (slave), is the Lord's freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ's servant.<a name=308:12></a> Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men".<a name=308:13></a> It says in the previous verse, If a man can be made free, "use it rather".<a name=308:14></a> A private, or common soldier, sells himself for a period of time and cannot get free, but an officer can get free if he likes.<a name=308:15></a> I only refer to this because sometimes we hear, "I cannot get free".<a name=308:16></a> No: because you do not like to obtain your freedom at a great sacrifice.<a name=308:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing, and it is of paramount importance, is, that you are Christ's slave, you are bought with a price; as I have said, even your children do not belong to you.<a name=308:18></a> You should be glad that you are a slave, because He is such a wonderful Master.<a name=308:19></a> I see where believers fail.<a name=308:20></a> They do not start with the fact, that they have a Master who has a full right over their whole life.<a name=308:21></a> It is not what you think you can spare Him, this or that.<a name=308:22></a> If you are honestly and fairly in His hands as His slave, you may be quite

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As another has said, I never knew of anyone who was cast wholly on the Lord, reduced to actual want, except one who lived on nettles for three days, and he had been in prison for the Lord's service.<a name=309:3></a> He added, You are hardly up to that yet; that is, we are not sufficiently devoted to be allowed to suffer the greater privations.<a name=309:4></a> Paul said, "In hunger and thirst", "in cold and nakedness".<a name=309:5></a> Well then, you start with the great fundamental principle, you are Christ's slave, bought with a price; and if you are an honest man you will carry it out in everything.<a name=309:6></a> People talk of fidelity, but do they begin with fidelity to Christ?<a name=309:7></a> If you are virtuous, "The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her".<a name=309:8></a> If you are not right with Christ, be sure you are feeble elsewhere, and all the way down.<a name=309:9></a> If you are not right at the top, how can you be right anywhere else?<a name=309:10></a> How can you expect a child not straight to his father and mother, to be straight to his brothers and sisters?<a name=309:11></a> to be straight to you?<a name=309:12></a> It could not be.<a name=309:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But is that all?<a name=309:14></a> No; He looks for you to be a trusty servant.<a name=309:15></a> "The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her".<a name=309:16></a> Can there be anything more beautiful?<a name=309:17></a> Thus Abraham was called the friend of God.<a name=309:18></a> I know Christ is my friend; thank God, He is: but I often wish I could say, I knew I was His friend more definitely.<a name=309:19></a> "Henceforth", the Lord says, "I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you".<a name=309:20></a> He does not surrender His claim by giving the servant a higher position.<a name=309:21></a> Service, then, is established in righteousness.<a name=309:22></a>

		thing.<a name=310:1></a> Thank God, I was led in anywise to think of serving the Lord.<a name=310:2></a> The first thing that attracted my heart from my very youth was that I must serve the Lord.<a name=310:3></a> I know very well how I have neglected it, and wavered from it; but the Lord never lets slip from you a real purpose of your heart; no matter how many years you may be, as it were, unattached, still He keeps it in mind, and as sure as possible, it will come, and this is an immense comfort to one's heart.<a name=310:4></a> Now in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12">Romans  12</a>what do you find?<a name=310:5></a> That your body is to be a living sacrifice.<a name=310:6></a> Why?<a name=310:7></a> Look at the end of chapter 6.<a name=310:8></a> The old man, the flesh, is dispossessed.<a name=310:9></a> And who dispossessed him?<a name=310:10></a> Christ.<a name=310:11></a> And what then?<a name=310:12></a> "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the compassions (mercies) of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice".<a name=310:13></a> It is your reasonable service, it is not a legal service.<a name=310:14></a> The body is the Lord's.<a name=310:15></a> I say, if you do not believe this, you will never understand service.<a name=310:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now I turn to another point, one of immense importance -- where am I to begin?<a name=310:17></a> Here I am a servant; I know I am a slave of Christ, I know my body is His, and I see that for myself I must forsake all that I have, and I say, Now where am I to begin?<a name=310:18></a> Well, it is of immense importance where you begin.<a name=310:19></a> I know very well if I look round at Christendom where they begin, and I know where the tendency of all our hearts is to begin.<a name=310:20></a> I thought in my younger days, that there was no way of serving the Lord but by being a clergyman, that I must go into the church, as the saying is.<a name=310:21></a> Now that is a right idea in itself, though I do not say it is rightly carried out.<a name=310:22></a> Some of you may wonder why I say that going into the church was a right idea, but if you read these verses, 4, 5, they will explain it to you.<a name=310:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Where do you begin then?<a name=310:24></a> With the body of Christ.<a name=310:25></a> "For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office: so we,

	<div class="paragraph">
		But now turn to <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4">Ephesians  4</a>, and I come to another point in connection with service.<a name=311:13></a> Here, again, I find what the beginning is connected with -- the assembly; the first thing is to walk worthy of the vocation.<a name=311:14></a> I am called to "endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace"; that is the first thing.<a name=311:15></a> I hope I shall be able to make it clearer to you presently, that if you are in association with Christ, in His presence in the midst of His own, you will get light as to that which is nearest to His heart; but I say this with reference to service -- as of one coming out from His presence to reflect Him here.<a name=311:16></a> The first service is, "endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace".<a name=311:17></a> Or to take the figure of <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#31">Proverbs  31</a>, the wise woman must be in health, or she will never keep things in order.<a name=311:18></a> I do everything to contribute to her health, and that is "endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace".<a name=311:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I come to gifts for service, which Ephesians unfolds.<a name=312:1></a> In Romans we get more our responsibility than special gifts, that which is common to every one, "showing mercy with cheerfulness".<a name=312:2></a> There is not one in this room who could not practise that grace.<a name=312:3></a> Picking up a little child out of the gutter would be "showing mercy with cheerfulness".<a name=312:4></a> To prophesy is the first, and you might say the highest; but I would rather have the last without the first, than the first without the last; it would be a poor thing to be a prophet and not to show mercy with cheerfulness; and what makes it so beautiful is, that it is a service within the reach of everybody, even a child.<a name=312:5></a> A child with only one penny may go and give it to a needy person, and show mercy with cheerfulness.<a name=312:6></a> But in Ephesians I come to special gifts, and verse 12 shows what they are for: "for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ".<a name=312:7></a> In Christendom they separate between the servant and the church, instead of making the church the actual common object of the servant.<a name=312:8></a> Here if I am an evangelist, I am working for the assembly as much as the teacher, but in another way.<a name=312:9></a> All have to do with the Lord, the Head, but they conspire to this one great end, "the perfecting of the saints".<a name=312:10></a> As the apostle says, "I endure all things for the elect's sake" -- they are prominent.<a name=312:11></a> If I am an evangelist, what am I looking for?<a name=312:12></a> I am searching the world round -- sweeping the house diligently to find the silver piece, and not merely in order to find it, but when I have found it, to put it with the other nine.<a name=312:13></a> But how can you, if you do not know where the other nine are?<a name=312:14></a> But that is exactly what happens in Christendom, they do not know where they are.<a name=312:15></a> But in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13">Matthew  13</a>, what do I find?<a name=312:16></a> that those who drew the net also selected the fish, and put the good into vessels; that is not in heaven, but on earth.<a name=312:17></a> As Paul said, "I have planted".<a name=312:18></a>

		<a name=313>[Page 313]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4">Ephesians  4</a>, the great point is, That special gifts are given from the Head, and not merely the service which is the duty of every man, as you get in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>, "The manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal".<a name=313:1></a> It is not given for yourself, it is given for the benefit of all; as lower down in this chapter, in verse 16, "compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part".<a name=313:2></a> If you are not acting in the Spirit, you are damaging the whole assembly; you may think the loss is only to yourself individually, but you are not an individual sufferer, you are making me suffer; I do not know how, but I am suffering from you because we are members of the one body.<a name=313:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In connection with special gifts, it is an interesting question, though I cannot say much upon it, when a person gets a gift.<a name=313:4></a> I do not think that it is necessarily at conversion.<a name=313:5></a> We know gifts were given after conversion.<a name=313:6></a> The apostle Paul was to be a minister and a witness of the things he had seen.<a name=313:7></a> His gift increased.<a name=313:8></a> But I want to bring before you that as the gift comes from Christ, it is not simply that you have the gift, but you must learn from Him the proper sphere for that gift; it must be in relation to Him.<a name=313:9></a> For instance, I take one whom we all speak of with honour, I mean Luther; I do not think, great as his gift was, that he was with the Lord in the midst of His own, that he knew Him there, so as to use his gift in relation to Christ's chief interest on earth.<a name=313:10></a> In fact, in one sense, no one does unless he is in association with Him.<a name=313:11></a> It is only there I can get true direction; how can I get it outside?<a name=313:12></a> I require to be in communion with my Lord in His circle of interest, if I would be directed and influenced by Him.<a name=313:13></a> I have no doubt there is a great deal more gift than is in exercise; but if you present your body a living sacrifice, your gift will come out.<a name=313:14></a> Many a one is

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		hindered by other things which monopolise him instead of Christ, and the gift does not come out.<a name=314:1></a> The gift is from Christ, and if you are not upright to Christ, to whom will you be upright?<a name=314:2></a> If you are not faithful to God, I could not believe that you are faithful to anybody; and I have seen it over and over again amongst Christians.<a name=314:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One passage of scripture is enough to settle the matter.<a name=314:4></a> I will quote now the Lord's words in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>"As my Father hath sent me, even so send I you".<a name=314:5></a> They were sent out from that place.<a name=314:6></a> And I have a wonderful sense if I am working from the Head, of the circle of His interest; and it is His interest I seek.<a name=314:7></a> If I am an evangelist, well, I have my gift from Christ, and I find He has sent me for the assembly, though my work is to seek for lost souls in the world.<a name=314:8></a> I go for Christ, as an ambassador for Christ.<a name=314:9></a> Do you think that makes you a worse evangelist?<a name=314:10></a> No.<a name=314:11></a> I claim souls for Christ, I come from Christ, I have my commission from Christ, and there is no place I get so established as to my gift as in the assembly.<a name=314:12></a> And I do not doubt at all that many a gifted person is not established in the Lord's presence.<a name=314:13></a> The case of Moses will illustrate my meaning.<a name=314:14></a> No doubt he knew he was called of God, but when did he come out in power, in the real sense that he was to act for God?<a name=314:15></a> Not till he saw the burning bush.<a name=314:16></a> And I believe that was what I may call his ordination; that is, that he got a peculiar knowledge of the Lord in that burning bush, and of His grace.<a name=314:17></a> This grace was to mark his ministry all the way through; and therefore the greatest blessing he could give, which he gave to Joseph, was "the blessing of him that dwelt in the bush".<a name=314:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was the same with Isaiah; but I put it to anyone who really understands that he has received anything from the Lord -- where did you get that confirmed?<a name=314:19></a> Where did you get His mind about it?<a name=314:20></a> You must be in the Lord's presence, in His own circle, to apprehend

	<div class="paragraph">
		A passage I will not leave out in this connection is <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#4:14">1 Timothy  4:14</a>: "Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery".<a name=316:6></a> The presbytery means the elders.<a name=316:7></a> It was as much as saying, We all go with you.<a name=316:8></a> I desire to get your heart into the sense that if I want to get right direction from the Lord, it is in the assembly I am to get it.<a name=316:9></a> It is not a question of gift.<a name=316:10></a> I get the gift absolutely from the Lord, but He directs me in relation to His own.<a name=316:11></a> I do not think we understand the assembly, and the presence of the Lord sufficiently.<a name=316:12></a> The presence of the Lord now introduces us into the holiest.<a name=316:13></a> "I went into the sanctuary of God" does not mean His presence in your own room; the antitype of that is the assembly.<a name=316:14></a> I do not think we have a sufficient idea of the wonderful nature of the assembly.<a name=316:15></a> I meet the Lord in the midst of His own; I never have His presence in the same way in my own room as in the assembly.<a name=316:16></a> The truth I have learned in my own room, comes out in a much fuller way in the assembly.<a name=316:17></a>

		Now the exercises here are very important.<a name=330:3></a> I trust you understand them.<a name=330:4></a> A believer always knows the service of the Lord before he has made personal acquaintance with Him.<a name=330:5></a> I read these verses as an illustration of such a state.<a name=330:6></a> Here Joseph's brethren had no doubt at all of Joseph's relationship to them and his continued service, but they did not know him so closely as to know his love or his feelings about them; they never had made such close acquaintance with him as to know his own mind, though they were seventeen years living on his bounty and doubtless esteemed him much.<a name=330:7></a> I am sure many Christians who have not the slightest doubt of the Lord's work and service, yet have never made acquaintance with the Lord personally; perhaps never make it till their death-bed.<a name=330:8></a> If you did not read your own heart in the light of Scripture you could hardly believe such a thing possible.<a name=330:9></a> If we look at this blind man in <a href="../bible/John.htm#9">John  9</a>, we find that he is outside of everything of man.<a name=330:10></a> All that he was taught from infancy to revere, to look up to as of God, all was gone; he was alone, outside everything; but he heard the voice of the Lord; saying, "Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee".<a name=330:11></a> The blessed moment of first acquaintance had come; any one in this room who has ever known it, will understand his deep joy.<a name=330:12></a> Joseph's brethren go and fall down before Joseph, for they think he will requite them for the evil they did to him, but "Joseph wept when they spake unto him", as much as to say, Is that all you know about me?<a name=330:13></a> The fact is, they did not know him.<a name=330:14></a>

		The first trait is that you are alone with Him; you have come to a Person.<a name=333:14></a> This will lead you to see beyond the general teaching in Christendom; that is, that instead of singing about your sins gone, you will be singing about Christ.<a name=333:15></a> You will sing of the Saviour when you know Him.<a name=333:16></a> It is the Deliverer you have then before your heart.<a name=333:17></a> Let me dwell upon this for a moment.<a name=333:18></a> You have made acquaintance with a Person.<a name=333:19></a> And now I will turn to <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:5">Romans  5:5</a>, a verse which tells you that the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, which is given to us.<a name=333:20></a> In <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:13">Ephesians  1:13</a> we read, "In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise".<a name=333:21></a> The Spirit always makes Christ paramount, and is in you a "fountain of water springing up into eternal life".<a name=333:22></a> I turn to <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10:43">Acts  10:43</a>, where it is stated, "To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall

		To explain it better, I turn to <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#17:15">Luke  17:15</a>: "And one of them, when he saw that he was healed turned back and with a loud voice glorified God, and fell down on his face, at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.<a name=334:10></a> And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed: but where are the nine?<a name=334:11></a> There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.<a name=334:12></a> And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole".<a name=334:13></a> Here the Samaritan makes acquaintance with the Lord who had healed him.<a name=334:14></a> The ten were cleansed, but nine of them went to ritualism, in order to obtain approach to God by religious services.<a name=334:15></a> One only recognised the Lord, and he turns back and fell down on his face at Christ's feet; he parts company with himself, he gives the Lord thanks, and the Lord commends him.<a name=334:16></a> He has made acquaintance with the Lord; this is his first acquaintance, that is the point.<a name=334:17></a> You see the same in other scriptures which I need not go into.<a name=334:18></a> The woman who was healed when she touched the hem of His garment, is a beautiful example of the effect of faith; she was quite cured.<a name=334:19></a> The Lord says, "Somebody has touched me", and He says, as it were, 'I want you to be acquainted with me', and she, "fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her".<a name=334:20></a> It was not enough to be sure of the work, but she must know Him who had cured her.<a name=334:21></a> "She

		The Lord has entered on a new order of things; and His washing is to remove everything that causes a shade of distance between you and Him, anything which would break communion with Him.<a name=344:1></a> Peter had affection, so much so (see <a href="../bible/John.htm#21:7">John  21:7</a>), that when he heard it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's coat unto him and did cast himself into the sea, and yet he was not restored.<a name=344:2></a> The Lord said to him after they had dined, "Lovest thou me more than these?<a name=344:3></a>" Peter had thought that he loved the Lord more than the other disciples.<a name=344:4></a> Peter had affection for the Lord, but he was not in communion with Him; on the contrary he was chief in leading the others astray, going a-fishing.<a name=344:5></a>

		Our subject on the previous evening was acquaintance with Christ in the assembly.<a name=372:1></a> There He is supreme; He walked through this world in superiority to the circumstances here, but in the assembly <i>He is supreme</i> .<a name=372:2></a> There was an assembly in the wilderness, but never "my assembly" until Christ was rejected.<a name=372:3></a> In <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#14:11">Matthew  14:11</a>, etc.<a name=372:4></a>, when the Lord heard that John the baptist was beheaded, He retired into the wilderness, and there He fed the poor of the flock, who followed Him; but as to Himself, He is no longer in the ship, as in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#8">Matthew  8</a>.<a name=372:5></a> He walks upon the water; He is supreme, not simply superior.<a name=372:6></a> To be superior implies that He is in the circumstances; to be supreme implies He is above them.<a name=372:7></a> The Lord is educating His disciples for the new structure, the assembly.<a name=372:8></a> Hence Peter leaves the ship, which was made for water, and walks on the water to go to Jesus.<a name=372:9></a> You get here in pattern the teaching in Colossians.<a name=372:10></a> Leaving the ship is really Jordan.<a name=372:11></a> Some regard Jordan as their own death.<a name=372:12></a> It is not; Jordan is your death with Christ, and if you by faith are dead with Christ, you have passed out of the order of things in which you are, as Peter did, leaving the ship to join the Lord; it is then you enter "my assembly".<a name=372:13></a> It is very little realised, that in "my assembly" you are in the presence of Christ supreme over all the evil here.<a name=372:14></a> Each believer is a stone, "To whom coming", we read, "as unto a living stone".<a name=372:15></a> You are in your place when you own the Lord in His place.<a name=372:16></a> There are many who are stones who have not entered on their place yet; they all will be in the future temple, but they do not enjoy their place in it here.<a name=372:17></a> You must

		There is much confusion in many minds as to the difference between the house and the body; the house is Christ's building, the body is the members united to the Head.<a name=373:4></a> You cannot call a stone a member, though a stone is a member; but a child can understand that a stone in a building is very different from the member of a body.<a name=373:5></a> In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>, the Holy Spirit came down, and He filled the house where they were sitting, and He sat upon each of them, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit: that is the house.<a name=373:6></a> The mystery was not yet revealed, but as they walked in the Spirit, they were subject to Christ.<a name=373:7></a> The Colossians were very exemplary, and yet they were not in the truth of the mystery, knowing Christ as the Head of the body.<a name=373:8></a> The lack of this truth has disorganised the church as a whole.<a name=373:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I trust each thoughtful soul will see the great addition there is to the assembly where the mystery is known.<a name=373:10></a> When you acknowledge the Spirit then you are subject to Christ; but there is more, He is Head, and this the apostle is pressing on the Colossians.<a name=373:11></a> This wonderful acquaintance with Christ as Head, is our subject tonight.<a name=373:12></a>

		I must premise, feelingly I trust, that I do not know much of it, but the more we are interested in it the more we seek it; but you must remember that you learn nothing divine without cost to yourself.<a name=373:13></a> All I ask is, are you prepared for this truth?<a name=373:14></a> The apostle was very earnest that the Colossians should lay hold of the mystery, even Christ the Head of the body.<a name=373:15></a> "Not holding the head", we read of some in the previous chapter.<a name=373:16></a>

		There are the two ministries, the gospel, and the assembly -- the mystery of God.<a name=374:15></a> We ought to take it to heart more, that we do not better understand the mystery.<a name=374:16></a> It is God's chief object on the earth.<a name=374:17></a>

		Our subject tonight is acquaintance with Christ as Head, the One who directs you.<a name=375:9></a> It is the most wonderful acquaintance!<a name=375:10></a> You will admit that it was a great thing for the queen of Sheba to have listened to Solomon's wisdom; but it is a much greater thing for you to be acquainted with Christ as your Head, He dictating to you and directing you; He does this individually.<a name=375:11></a> He may direct you to a passage of Scripture, but still it is positive direction for yourself.<a name=375:12></a> It is not impulse, it is direction.<a name=375:13></a> Would you not like to be directed by Him?<a name=375:14></a> A blessed acquaintance!<a name=375:15></a> The queen of Sheba knew nothing of Solomon until she came to him.<a name=375:16></a> First, you must apprehend that you are "complete in him who is the head of all principality and power"; there is no place for any addition from either learning or religiousness.<a name=375:17></a> You are complete in Christ.<a name=375:18></a> Many read the Bible with interest who do not know the Lord personally.<a name=375:19></a> The

		The second is also of the deepest moment.<a name=376:5></a> Verse 11, "In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the flesh" -- "the sins of" must be left out -- "by the circumcision of Christ".<a name=376:6></a> You are complete in Him, and the body of the flesh has been cut off in the cross.<a name=376:7></a> Now if you do not in faith hold these two facts, you will never know Christ as your Head; you may read of it, but you are not in the truth of it.<a name=376:8></a> In type the circumcision was not until after the crossing of Jordan.<a name=376:9></a> Circumcision the "putting off of the body of the flesh" was effected in the cross.<a name=376:10></a> Some religious copyist was so perplexed by the passage, that he put in the word 'sins'.<a name=376:11></a> He could understand the sins being put away, but he could not understand the putting off of the body of the flesh.<a name=376:12></a> The body of the flesh is removed in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ; it is effected for you by God, but you are to realise the fact experimentally.<a name=376:13></a>

		We read in verse 20, "Wherefore, if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world".<a name=376:14></a> Here it is not merely dead to sin, but that you have by faith passed out of natural things though still in them; you are "dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world".<a name=376:15></a> I do not mean that you die and leave the world, but that you are morally outside of it; you are "dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world"; you have passed out of old things into a new order of things.<a name=376:16></a> You will find that the One who has effected all this for you is your Head.<a name=376:17></a>

		Now we come to chapter 3: "If ye then be risen with Christ".<a name=377:3></a> Beloved friends, where are you if you are not?<a name=377:4></a> The Lord, when He rose from the dead, said first to His disciples, Peace be unto you; then He breathed on them, saying, "Receive ye [the] Holy Spirit" -- life in the Spirit.<a name=377:5></a> They can join Him as in the assembly.<a name=377:6></a> Suppose it was said to Peter, You have joined the Lord above everything here, now you are to be directed by Him; He is your Head.<a name=377:7></a> You have to pass through a like experience.<a name=377:8></a> Hence we read, "If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God".<a name=377:9></a> Then, at verse 5, you are practically at Gilgal -- "Mortify, therefore, your members which are upon the earth".<a name=377:10></a> "Set your affections on things above, not on things on the earth" -- you are looking for a new order of things -- "for ye have died, and your life is hid with Christ in God"; you are now outside of the life here; you are in an out-of-the-world condition of things.<a name=377:11></a> Now this is the practical setting aside of the old man; not merely dead to sin, but the whole rolled away.<a name=377:12></a> Mortify all that is of your own will, and put off all your evil habits.<a name=377:13></a> The best illustration I can give you is Elisha's act after he had received Elijah's power -- he took up his own clothes and rent them in two pieces, he had done with them.<a name=377:14></a> That is the great point.<a name=377:15></a> You have put off the body of the flesh, it is cut off in the cross, and you enter on a new order entirely, on new creation ground; "But now ye also put off all these: anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.<a name=377:16></a> Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds".<a name=377:17></a> You may say, the old man is here still.<a name=377:18></a> I quite admit that the old man is here

		Where anyone is rejoicing in Christ as his life, he is over Jordan (Stephen was over Jordan), but that man may not have practically accepted Jordan; he meets with a loss or disappointment the next day, and is quite overcome by it.<a name=378:2></a> When once you have left the ship and entered on new ground, you know what it is; but it can only be retained in faith by the Spirit.<a name=378:3></a> If you have died with Christ, you live with Him.<a name=378:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now you have put on the new man, which is yours; you have put off the old man, which has been cut off in the cross.<a name=378:5></a> In verse 11 we read, "Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all".<a name=378:6></a> There is no class of man at all.<a name=378:7></a> The Greek is the learned man, the Jew the religious man; no man now, as you get in another place, but "Jesus only".<a name=378:8></a> Now, beloved friends, would not any devoted heart rejoice to reach a spot where Jesus is everything?<a name=378:9></a> Many can say genuinely, "He is the chiefest among ten thousand" and "altogether lovely".<a name=378:10></a> But there is much more here: "Christ is everything".<a name=378:11></a>

		If your heart is true to the One who was rejected in this world and is now exalted to God's right hand, you would rejoice that you are called to be here for Him in the very place where He was rejected: but in order to be truly for Him where He is rejected you must first know Him as your Head.<a name=378:12></a> Next, you lose your individuality, the interests of Christ occupy your thoughts.<a name=378:13></a> It is not merely 'Christ for me'; but I should add, Christ's things for me; like a wife, her husband's interests are her interests.<a name=378:14></a> When you come to this, that "Christ is everything", you realise the Head; there is no one there but Christ.<a name=378:15></a> May you dwell upon the immense joy of heart in this great

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You apprehend, I hope, this wonderful acquaintance with Christ -- He is your Head.<a name=379:4></a> Now let us see the result of this acquaintance.<a name=379:5></a> Firstly, when you know Christ as your Head, it is His own that you are occupied with.<a name=379:6></a> "Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering; forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any; even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.<a name=379:7></a> And above all these things put on charity" -- love -- "Which is the bond of perfectness".<a name=379:8></a> "We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren".<a name=379:9></a> We love them because they belong to Christ.<a name=379:10></a> "And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful"; -- still occupied with His own.<a name=379:11></a> "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another, in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.<a name=379:12></a> And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him".<a name=379:13></a> Secondly, you are ruled by Christ in your own house.<a name=379:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Lastly, I would say a little on the effect of this acquaintance in the assembly, though I know but little of it; but I believe Christ, as your Head, would direct you to a suited hymn for the assembly, and restrain you if you were thinking of an unsuited one.<a name=379:15></a> It is not impulse.<a name=379:16></a> It is faith in the Lord that you are acting according to His pleasure, for you have looked to Him for direction.<a name=379:17></a> You must remember that you

	<div class="paragraph">
		I trust the Lord will use my attempt to be a help to each of you, that you may be more and more interested in this subject, acquaintance with Christ as your Head; that as you know Him as your Saviour, and know Him as supreme in the assembly, that you may be led a step further and know Him as your Head, the Head of the body, thus made conscious that we derive all from Him.<a name=380:4></a> The Lord grant that each one of you may be more deeply interested in what is so interesting to Him.<a name=380:5></a> If you do not as yet regard Him as your Head, He regards you as belonging to Himself, and He would like to lead you and direct you according to His pleasure.<a name=380:6></a>

		The subject I have endeavoured to bring before you is "Acquaintance with Christ".<a name=381:1></a> The first evening I showed you that you are acquainted with Him risen from the dead; not merely that you had found relief, but that, in your heart, you were acquainted with the Reliever, you are acquainted with His love.<a name=381:2></a> "The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given unto us".<a name=381:3></a> The Holy Spirit comes from Himself, and then, like Jonathan when Goliath is gone, a greater than David absorbs your heart.<a name=381:4></a> This is first acquaintance.<a name=381:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The second is, that I know Him in glory where He is.<a name=381:6></a> Glory is more a condition than a place; it is the expression of God's satisfaction according to all His attributes; you know Him there: and instead of being repelled like Isaiah, you are at home there; you are greeted with a ministration of righteousness.<a name=381:7></a> You are acquainted with Him in a new order of things, where the flesh has no place.<a name=381:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a great difference between the individual blessing and the corporate blessing.<a name=382:16></a> A Christian who is enjoying the highest blessing individually, delights in the wonderful position into which union with Christ introduces him.<a name=382:17></a> You, once a child of Adam, are now a child of God, and the joys of the Father's house are yours; and besides, you are united to Christ at the right hand of God.<a name=382:18></a> His circle of interest is your circle

		I have read these two verses from <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>that you might see the counsel of God.<a name=383:3></a> It is not here what is made known to you by union, but the simple fact that we are all united to Christ by the Spirit.<a name=383:4></a> Though many do not understand union, they are united, but they have to realise it.<a name=383:5></a> I hope to show you the effect of realising it.<a name=383:6></a> It is your portion, that you are united to Christ; it is the work of grace.<a name=383:7></a> God has done it; and hence we read, "That ye may (know) what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward .<a name=383:8></a>.<a name=383:9></a>.<a name=383:10></a> which he wrought in Christ".<a name=383:11></a> When?<a name=383:12></a> Over Jordan?<a name=383:13></a> Not a word about Jordan here; "which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead", and without delay, brought Him all the way from the bottom to the top, "and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places".<a name=383:14></a> And you too are raised up.<a name=383:15></a> One might say, I do not know it.<a name=383:16></a> My desire is that you should know it.<a name=383:17></a> The force of the word 'know' in this passage is conscious knowledge, a sense in yourself of the truth of it.<a name=383:18></a> But still it is true of you, even though it be not true to you; it is true of you before you have conscious knowledge of it.<a name=383:19></a> Like a child born a prince, who for years does not know that he is one.<a name=383:20></a> Many very great blessings are ours, but as yet we do not know the good of them.<a name=383:21></a> You have the right of possession; but you must make use of your possession to realise the good of it.<a name=383:22></a> The object of ministry is to lead you into it; in fact, there are three activities always working to lead you into it.<a name=383:23></a> There is the Spirit of God (because everything has been effected) working in you, to bring you into all that is yours.<a name=383:24></a> There is the ministry of the word; all the gifts were given to this end -- "till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a full-grown man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ".<a name=383:25></a> And thirdly, there is prayer.<a name=383:26></a> Your conscience is awakened by the word

		Here, then, is the counsel of God, and it is a great thing to understand it.<a name=384:2></a> May every one in this room lay hold of the fact, that by God's grace you are united to Christ; just as you can say, by God's grace I am forgiven my sins.<a name=384:3></a> There was a time when you did not know you were forgiven your sins; the work was done, but you did not know it.<a name=384:4></a> The youngest believer is united to Christ as surely as the oldest, though I do not say that he realises it, and until he does, he does not know the intimacy peculiar to it.<a name=384:5></a> I feel for myself how little I know it or can speak of it, because a servant is not to speak beyond his faith.<a name=384:6></a>

		Now I turn to <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3">Ephesians  3</a>, where the effect of union is declared.<a name=384:7></a> The type of Abraham sending his steward to find a bride for his son, will help you to understand it.<a name=384:8></a> The steward was sworn not to accept a bride for Isaac except she was of his kindred.<a name=384:9></a> May you specially lay hold of this, that union does not advance your acceptance with God.<a name=384:10></a> You are individually accepted in the beloved.<a name=384:11></a> Hence, as you may have often heard, <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1">Ephesians  1</a>, for the most part, is taken up with you individually.<a name=384:12></a> Each one is "accepted in the Beloved"; you cannot advance on that.<a name=384:13></a> But it is of the deepest importance to see that you are not fit to be united to Christ except you are of His kindred; it is incorrect to say that He is of your kindred; you are of His kindred.<a name=384:14></a> Hence we read in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:11">Hebrews  2:11</a>: "Both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one, for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren".<a name=384:15></a> They are fit to be His companions.<a name=384:16></a> You do not get beyond companionship in Hebrews.<a name=384:17></a> We are companions individually; in the assembly we are an organism; but there is more, we are united to Him.<a name=384:18></a> Hence the first step is, that you are brought to Christ

	<div class="heading">
		THE RESURRECTION AS IT IS TO GOD.

		You will not wonder if I proceed slowly and perhaps not always quite distinctly, because the subject, as I am presenting it, is new to me, and I have to speak carefully.<a name=392:5></a> But I see the importance of it, and I desire to convey it to you.<a name=392:6></a> The first part is to understand the resurrection as it is to God.<a name=392:7></a> The resurrection is a proof that a Man has glorified God.<a name=392:8></a> I cannot turn to every scripture which relates to it, but I will name the chapters.<a name=392:9></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#12">John  12</a>the Lord says, "Father, save me from this hour; but for this cause came I unto this hour.<a name=392:10></a> Father, glorify thy name.<a name=392:11></a> Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again".<a name=392:12></a> The Son of God was glorified when He raised Lazarus, and He was glorified Himself when He was raised up; as we read in another place, He was "raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father".<a name=392:13></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#13:31">John  13:31</a> gives you the whole in a small compass: "Therefore when he [Judas] was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.<a name=392:14></a> If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him".<a name=392:15></a> I ask you to ponder the fact that a Man has glorified God.<a name=392:16></a> I believe there is an immensity conveyed in that -- a Man has glorified God, and the glory claimed that Man.<a name=392:17></a> I ask you to dwell for a moment upon what that is to God.<a name=392:18></a> It is not merely that Christ has come when man had failed

		under every trial.<a name=393:1></a> If you look at the history of man as the scripture recounts it, you will see that the more God revealed Himself to him (and in every new dispensation God was more revealed to man than in the previous one), the more he failed.<a name=393:2></a> And so at the end the Lord says, "I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for nought and in vain".<a name=393:3></a> But now what has come?<a name=393:4></a> God has laid help upon One that is mighty.<a name=393:5></a> His own arm has brought salvation to Him; He sends His Son, and the Son says, "I come to do thy will, O God".<a name=393:6></a> Not only did He in private and in public set forth everything to the satisfaction of God -- He came as the healer of the breach -- but after having been for thirty years in all His walk and ways beautiful in the eye of God in private life, He so set forth God in His public ministry that on the holy mount there comes a voice out of the cloud, saying, "This is my beloved Son; hear him".<a name=393:7></a> It culminates in the mount of Transfiguration, where the glory itself claims Him.<a name=393:8></a> And now from this point, He goes down to die.<a name=393:9></a> Not only was He in every way beautiful to God as a Man upon the earth, but now He will bear the judgment that rests upon man.<a name=393:10></a> That judgment is death; there are not merely sins on man, but death is on him.<a name=393:11></a> Hence the Lord descends from the holy mount to die, and He says, "This is your hour and the power of darkness".<a name=393:12></a> We know that in the garden of Gethsemane this perfect One, the delight of God as a Man here upon earth, anticipated the terrible judgment He was to bear.<a name=393:13></a> Great as that was, it was not all.<a name=393:14></a> The marvellous work was that He who came to bear the judgment on man, not only bore it, but in bearing the judgment He glorified God.<a name=393:15></a> You will see presently the effect of this.<a name=393:16></a> He not only bore the judgment due to man, gave up the life to which sin could be attached, but could say, "Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again".<a name=393:17></a> He so unswervingly maintained all that was due to God in

		Now the first thing with Him is, that through it He has opened the way for God to express His heart to His full satisfaction.<a name=395:3></a> That which was a puzzle to the prodigal's elder brother, is made clear, even that the one who was a disgrace to the family should be greeted with the greatest affection, and set in the highest place, and that the one who had always been well conducted should not receive anything of the same character.<a name=395:4></a> Why was that?<a name=395:5></a> Because the prodigal is brought in on the ground of the glorified Man; the other is on the ground of his goodness.<a name=395:6></a> People dwell on the importance of forgiveness; but forgiveness -- great grace as that is -- is a very small part of the gospel; for the gospel is not merely the benefit and gain of the sinner, but there is God's part in it; as Christ said after His interview with the woman of Samaria, "I have meat to eat that ye know not of .<a name=395:7></a>.<a name=395:8></a>.<a name=395:9></a>.<a name=395:10></a> My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work".<a name=395:11></a> He says, as it were, I want to let my Father's heart come out according to all its mighty volume, and express itself to a poor prodigal.<a name=395:12></a> I do not think we can at all estimate what the joy was to Christ, when He said, "I have glorified thee on the earth; I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do".<a name=395:13></a>

		We have seen that the man under the judgment of death has gone in judgment in the cross of Christ, and the Man who bore that judgment and thus removed it, is the only Man now before the eye of God, so that God can be "just, and the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus".<a name=397:8></a> I have already spoken of the elder brother: how unaccountable it was to him that the prodigal, who was a disgrace and a scandal, should be received with the greatest affection and distinction.<a name=397:9></a> Simply because he is received on the ground of the glorified Man, and not merely on the ground of a forgiven sinner.<a name=397:10></a> God can now come forth in the fulness of His heart to every returning one, because He accepts us "in the Beloved".<a name=397:11></a> No one can fully estimate the greatness of this reception; how the blessed God can greet the returning prodigal!<a name=397:12></a> We read of it as a parable; but it is a communication of infinite blessing

		Christ in rising from the dead has overcome all the power of evil.<a name=401:4></a> If you ponder on the immense range which the resurrection embraces you will be greatly helped.<a name=401:5></a> "Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is the devil"; He fulfils the promise in Eden that one born of a woman should bruise the serpent's head.<a name=401:6></a> He could say, "This is your hour and the power of darkness"; but, as we read in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2">Colossians  2</a>, He triumphed over all in death; and as He says to John in Patmos, "I have the keys of hell and of death".<a name=401:7></a> I need not multiply passages; but you will see that He must reign till all enemies be put under His feet; "Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet"; "The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death".<a name=401:8></a> And you see in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:19">Ephesians  1:19</a> that we share with Him in the power of His resurrection; "And [to know] what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is

		Now we have come to a great point; that is, that the Spirit of God is given to every one justified.<a name=409:13></a> In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>we are justified by faith; that is, I believe, that God has set me before His own eye according to His pleasure in Christ Jesus, and "therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom also we have access by faith into this favour [grace] wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God".<a name=409:14></a> I need not tell you that the first eleven verses of that chapter describe the terms on which God is with you; chapter 8 describes the state in which you are before Him: that

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have read this scripture that we might, by the Lord's goodness, meditate upon what the meaning of "PART WITH ME" is.<a name=420:1></a> In the last lecture, any who were here will remember that we were learning how Christ is formed in us; the Christ owned in His right place in each of us, like Isaac in Abraham's house.<a name=420:2></a> It is a wonderful moment, because you are free from the intruder; and you can say, "I am crucified with Christ; nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me"; a new order of person lives in me.<a name=420:3></a> Hence you are not only free of the old, but you are in the new.<a name=420:4></a> The apostle illustrates this to the Galatians (who were trying to improve themselves), by the type of the day when Isaac was weaned and Ishmael cast out, which doubtless describes a moment which ought to be known to every one of us, that is, when Christ is acknowledged in His right place.<a name=420:5></a> It is a festive moment, a moment of deep joy; it must be so, because in true righteousness Christ is in His place; hence the apostle adds, "Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free".<a name=420:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You must know the two subjects which I have already dwelt upon before you can address yourself to "PART WITH ME".<a name=420:7></a> One is the marvellous acceptance in which you are with God; the other is liberty.<a name=420:8></a> You are to His full satisfaction, because He has accepted you in the Beloved.<a name=420:9></a> It is on this ground you are accepted.<a name=420:10></a> It is not on the ground of a man who had not offended, but on the ground of the Man who glorified God in bearing the judgment upon man.<a name=420:11></a> The acceptance could not be greater, it could not be improved, it is unalterable.<a name=420:12></a> That is the first grace, and if there be any imperfection in the apprehension

		of it, there must be an imperfection in liberty.<a name=421:1></a> The first is that God has removed everything of the man under judgment from His own eye in the cross to His everlasting glory, so that His heart can in all its fulness greet the prodigal.<a name=421:2></a> The second grace is, that God has given you the Holy Spirit; and now Christ gets His place in your heart: "Stand fast, therefore, in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage".<a name=421:3></a> Now you are free, and now you progress; and you do not progress till you come to this.<a name=421:4></a> You now are occupied with Christ as He is; now you begin to know "PART WITH ME".<a name=421:5></a>

		Two lines open out to every believer when he is in liberty, but not before he finds liberty.<a name=421:6></a> One is that as he is liable to infirmity, the question necessarily arises, How am I to be borne above my infirmity?<a name=421:7></a> The other, as I am on the earth where Christ is rejected, the question arises, Where is the Lord to be found?<a name=421:8></a> You see that one plainly relates to yourself, and the other to the Lord.<a name=421:9></a> There are two lines, though you will find by-and-by how they converge.<a name=421:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first is, as I have said, that you are liable to infirmity.<a name=421:11></a> I do not refer to sins, because Christ having purged our sins, sat down; there is no more offering for sin.<a name=421:12></a> It is most important to know that if you are not cleared of your sins, you cannot have to do with the High Priest, He who will bear you above your infirmities.<a name=421:13></a> In Christendom all is leavened, for the priest or minister is looked at as between the congregation and God, thus the truth is reduced to man's level.<a name=421:14></a> The truth is that you are already set in the fullest acceptance with God, and you are in true liberty.<a name=421:15></a> Next, as you are in a scene where you can be oppressed by infirmities -- not sins -- you want to know how you can be above your infirmities.<a name=421:16></a> I turn to <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#4:14">Hebrews  4:14</a>, "Seeing then that we have a great High Priest, that is passed into [through] the heavens,

		Now let us turn to the second line.<a name=428:1></a> Read <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:18">John  14:18</a> - 20: "I will not leave you comfortless; I will come to you.<a name=428:2></a> Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also.<a name=428:3></a> At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you".<a name=428:4></a> I trust that many here know the joy of joining Christ in the assembly; nothing can satisfy a true heart in a scene like this but to have part with Himself outside of all the ruin here.<a name=428:5></a> He says, "I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice".<a name=428:6></a> "I will not leave you comfortless".<a name=428:7></a> "You" embraces the whole company.<a name=428:8></a> Remember, I began with the individual, for it is individually we learn the Priest but when you enter the Holiest, you know Him, "The great Priest over the house of God"; you are in company now.<a name=428:9></a> You enter the assembly individually, you, a living stone, are built in, "If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious; to whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, precious".<a name=428:10></a> Now you are built up.<a name=428:11></a> The Lord grant that each of us may know better by the Spirit of God the great joy which Peter had when he joined Christ walking on the water.<a name=428:12></a> Surely you are thankful to see Peter taking the step.<a name=428:13></a> I do not present the step to a young believer; but I say if you have affection for Christ, you would like to join Him, and you would not be deterred by the step.<a name=428:14></a> You cannot join Him without taking this immense step.<a name=428:15></a> It could not be possible otherwise.<a name=428:16></a> I do not deny that you may have been helped spiritually at the meeting, but unless you have taken the step to join Him, you have not experienced the joy of having part with Him where He fulfils the word, "I will not leave you comfortless [orphans]; I will come to you", "Because I live, ye shall live also".<a name=428:17></a> Now note how it culminates, "In that day you shall know" -- (now it is about Himself) -- "that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you".<a name=428:18></a> I am not going to attempt to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before I proceed, I just refer to an interesting point in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:22">John  14:22</a>, 23: "Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?<a name=429:3></a> Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him".<a name=429:4></a> I refer to this because one might say, In this wonderful place, "Part with me", collectively, is there anything for the individual?<a name=429:5></a> Now this is for the individual.<a name=429:6></a> In the rest of the chapter it is all "you" collectively that is used.<a name=429:7></a> But in these verses it is, "If a <i>man</i> love me, he will keep my words".<a name=429:8></a> Generally we are looking to the Lord to do something for us, to receive a mark of His favour, some temporal mercy.<a name=429:9></a> But here He gives the highest favour in part with Himself; to the company He says, "I will not leave you orphans; I will come to you".<a name=429:10></a> I will come to you, and acquaint you with Myself, and how you are in relation to Me.<a name=429:11></a> Surely any one who dwells upon verse 20 will know how profound it is.<a name=429:12></a> I do not attempt to explain it; it embraces immensely more than you imagine.<a name=429:13></a> Then in verse 23 we see the portion for the individual, "If a man love me, he will keep my word; and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him and make our abode with him".<a name=429:14></a> As another has said, 'They will have a room in your heart'.<a name=429:15></a> It is not that He is always there, but He has a room there; it is <i>His</i> room.<a name=429:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now you will be prepared for the result of all this grace.<a name=429:17></a> We find it in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:26">John  14:26</a>: "But the Comforter, which is the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I

		have said unto you".<a name=430:1></a> The Spirit of God revives to the disciples Christ's ministry here, so that the result, having part with Him in the assembly, is that you, as we read in chapter 15, come out in service, fruit-bearing; you are in that sense a branch of the vine, bringing forth fruit on the earth where He was rejected.<a name=430:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I should like to recapitulate the blessings of each line, and I trust that you will follow me prayerfully.<a name=430:3></a> The first line is, that when you are under pressure here, and have part with Christ, you are borne above it, because you have part with Him.<a name=430:4></a> And this culminates in your accompanying Him into the brightest spot, the Holiest of all, so that you can behold the Lord's glory with so much effect that you are transformed into moral correspondence with His pleasure at the time.<a name=430:5></a> I am speaking now of the effect of having part with Him.<a name=430:6></a> Like the disciples at Emmaus, they saw the Lord; He did not give them any directions that we know of; but the effect of seeing Him was that they went off to Jerusalem; the fact of being in His company made His interests paramount with them.<a name=430:7></a> Hence the practical result on that line is, that laying aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us, we run with patience the race that is set before us.<a name=430:8></a> We look for nothing here, but we are looking for everything where Christ is.<a name=430:9></a> We are not come "to the mount that might be touched and that burned with fire", but we "are come unto mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God", etc.<a name=430:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the other line you pass outside of all the ruin and misery of man, to find the Lord in the assembly on the earth, and you are there outside of all here, for you have part with Him.<a name=430:11></a> Then is fulfilled, "I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice"; "I will not leave you orphans; I will come to you".<a name=430:12></a> You sit under His shadow with great delight; you have part

		with Him; and this culminates in that you come forth to bear fruit here as His disciples.<a name=431:1></a> It is not merely relief now; you begin with being borne above the pressure here, and this culminates in your being absorbed with Himself; you are so attracted to Him who is outside of all here, that you are not looking for anything here; you are running on to Him.<a name=431:2></a> Then in the second line you have joined Him in His assembly, you have part with Him there, outside of all the ruin and the misery of man; you have tasted of the reality of His words: "Because I live, ye shall live also"; and you are in a sphere altogether unknown to man.<a name=431:3></a> You are so absorbed with Him, outside of all the ruin, that, like the queen of Sheba, "there is no more spirit in you", you are beside yourself.<a name=431:4></a> If Christ were thus known in the assembly, how you would long for it!<a name=431:5></a> You could truly say, "I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the LORD".<a name=431:6></a> In Christendom the most advanced go to church to enjoy their salvation; they have no true idea of the house of God.<a name=431:7></a> The house of God is where He is; "the habitation of God through the Spirit"; and hence there you would learn His mind, as we read in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:12">Hebrews  2:12</a>: "I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee".<a name=431:8></a> He unfolds the Father; you cannot worship until you are in His presence.<a name=431:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I need not add more.<a name=431:10></a> I have tried to present to you the blessedness of having PART WITH HIM, how it begins; and if you are led to dwell upon it before the Lord, you will be thankful that there is such a portion for you while on the earth.<a name=431:11></a>

		The subject I desire to bring before you is "THE WILDERNESS"; for though we so often speak of the wilderness, perhaps there is no subject (I speak for myself) we know so little about according to God.<a name=432:1></a> I have read the passage from <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15">Exodus  15</a>to show the way you enter the wilderness, where you prove that the flesh profiteth nothing, where you learn yourself: while in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21">Numbers  21</a>you are brought to see a new state.<a name=432:2></a> You learn the incompetency of the flesh, of your own state, in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15">Exodus  15</a>, and you are given a new state by the Spirit of God, as seen typically in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21">Numbers  21</a>.<a name=432:3></a> But firstly, and it is of the deepest importance, you cannot enter the wilderness except you have been delivered from the judgment of death, and are on the other side of the Red Sea.<a name=432:4></a> You may sometimes hear a person speaking of the trials of the wilderness who has never entered the wilderness.<a name=432:5></a> If you have entered the wilderness, you have entered it through death, and you are clear of death in the sight of God.<a name=432:6></a>

		In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#4">Romans  4</a>, when you believe that God has raised Christ from the dead, you are justified by faith, you can joy in God.<a name=432:7></a> But consequent on this every believer finds that he is sinful.<a name=432:8></a> In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>and 7 you find that the first thing you are occupied with is relief from sinfulness.<a name=432:9></a> Hence the true character of the wilderness is death to the will of the flesh; it is Marah; properly, the water of the Red Sea.<a name=432:10></a> I feel, in myself, how little one accepts the wilderness in its true character.<a name=432:11></a> You have been delivered from the judgment on man by the death and resurrection of Christ here in this place, where you were under the judgment of God, and now this place is a wilderness

		The great characteristic of any one truly in the wilderness is dependence.<a name=434:10></a> Turn to <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#8:2">Deuteronomy  8:2</a>: "Thou shalt remember all the way" -- mark how definite that is; all your history, remember it -- "which the LORD thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee.<a name=434:11></a>.<a name=434:12></a>.<a name=434:13></a>.<a name=434:14></a> And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live".<a name=434:15></a> The Lord, when He went into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil, quotes this scripture.<a name=434:16></a> He needed not to go into the wilderness to learn dependence, for He was in circumstances the contrast to Adam in the garden of Eden.<a name=434:17></a> Adam was surrounded by every mark of God's goodness and care for him, but in the midst of it all he gave way.<a name=434:18></a> Here is the Lord, forty days without food; He takes the lowest place, there is no intimation of God's care for Him, but Satan comes to Him and says, so to speak, Use your own power.<a name=434:19></a> It is there where we fail.<a name=434:20></a> Be assured there is no one who has either material or

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first chapter the apostle longs to depart and to be with Christ; no doubt he felt the pressure of prison-life; he had lost everything he naturally valued in this world, even Jerusalem on which his heart was set for God; he had nothing now personally to keep him here; he was a heavenly man in the wilderness, hence he longs to depart and be with Christ.<a name=441:3></a> But it is better for the church that he should remain, so he will remain; but his expectation, as always, so now also is that Christ shall be magnified in his body, whether it be by life or by death.<a name=441:4></a> How beautiful!<a name=441:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 2 the subject is the low place the Lord came down to from the highest in order to be a servant.<a name=441:6></a> He made Himself of no reputation, emptied Himself.<a name=441:7></a> He who being in the form of God, thought it not rapine to be equal with God, became a man, and took upon Him the form of a servant, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.<a name=441:8></a> Paul was a prisoner in Rome, and he was ready to go down to any degree to be a servant.<a name=441:9></a>
	</div>

		Chapter 3 is more within our reach, as I might say.<a name=441:10></a> You prefer Christ to anything of man; all that is gain to you you count but loss for Christ; you count all but rubbish that you may win Christ.<a name=441:11></a> There is a connection with chapter 1; Paul there longs to depart and be with Him, because to die would be gain; hence now he says, as it were, I am, not going to Him, but I want to gain Him now.<a name=441:12></a> This chapter ends with a very important experience.<a name=441:13></a> In the epistle to the Ephesians there is nothing about the Lord's coming.<a name=441:14></a> Why?<a name=441:15></a> Because you are in company with Christ in heavenly places.<a name=441:16></a> But when you find yourself in the wilderness, you as a heavenly man would say, "Our conversation is in heaven"; we are subjects on the earth, we are

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 4 is more within our practical experience.<a name=442:8></a> Here is Paul, a man in prison, and he tells us that he has learnt in whatsoever state he is, to be satisfied; he knows how to be abased and how to abound; whether he is in the lowest position, or in affluence, he is the same in either.<a name=442:9></a> A man in very low circumstances is naturally depressed, and when he is prosperous he is elated; but the apostle can say, I have learnt in all things to be satisfied.<a name=442:10></a> Our translators could not catch the idea, and they put in the word 'content' it is "satisfied".<a name=442:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I trust many in this room will feel that the wilderness is a wonderful subject.<a name=442:12></a> I may not have helped you much, yet I believe you will get great help if you simply accept that you are delivered from the judgment of death by the death of Christ, and that you expect nothing but Marah -- death to the old man in this world, and yet abounding grace from God.<a name=442:13></a> "When he putteth forth his own sheep he goeth before them".<a name=442:14></a> Thus you learn the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ in a wonderfully real way; how it meets you at every turn; you ought not to enter on anything here except you have previously gathered the manna.<a name=442:15></a> Then you know "My grace is sufficient for thee".<a name=442:16></a> I believe as

		I turn now to verse 11, and you will see how it is consequent on the previous one, "In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the flesh" -- not '<i>sins</i> of the flesh' -- "by the circumcision of Christ".<a name=449:2></a> There, beloved friends, the body of the flesh is put off in the cross of Christ.<a name=449:3></a> It is the antitype of Gilgal, the rolling off; the circumcision after Israel had crossed over Jordan.<a name=449:4></a> In the previous lectures I did not come so far as Jordan, only outside of man.<a name=449:5></a> Now you are outside the world; "dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world" and in Christ's circle of things.<a name=449:6></a> Now you find that you cannot make any trial of man in the flesh; that you, in the circumcision of Christ, have put off the body of the flesh.<a name=449:7></a> Some pious copyist put in the words "the sins of"; he saw that if the body of the flesh was put off there would be no place for his religiousness, so he added "the sins of".<a name=449:8></a> If a monk were the copyist, he would say, If that means simply "the body of the flesh", then all my religion is worthless.<a name=449:9></a> Hence "the sins of" would make it easy for him.<a name=449:10></a> The true meaning is "the body of the flesh" put off in the circumcision of Christ; it is a stronger expression even than "crucified".<a name=449:11></a> Now that you are complete in Christ, what can be added to Him?<a name=449:12></a> You cannot require an addition if you are complete in Him.<a name=449:13></a> I say to the youngest, Where is your affection for Christ if you do not think Him enough for you?<a name=449:14></a> Now you will learn that He is everything, and having put off the body of the flesh in the cross, it is not your work, it is His work that is to be carried out practically by you.<a name=449:15></a> It is very definitely stated: "In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands".<a name=449:16></a> Israel were not circumcised in the wilderness; not until they came to Gilgal were they circumcised, the rolling off the reproach of Egypt.<a name=449:17></a> If it has not

		not with the intention of explaining it, but proceeding step by step, that you may the more easily apprehend this great subject: "Not holding the head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth".<a name=450:4></a> Now you see that "the Head" is common to all the members; the Christ, who is living in you and living in me, He is your Head; and you know Him now in a new capacity; it is not merely as affording to you the greatest relief, but He is your Head; and the Head of every one of His own.<a name=450:5></a> I do not say that all know it; would to God that all did; but I am presenting to you the only way by which you can be preserved from the intrusion of the flesh in one form or another.<a name=450:6></a> In that day the snare was Judaism and gnosticism.<a name=450:7></a> In this day in Christendom they are designated rationalism and ritualism.<a name=450:8></a> Nothing can preserve you from this leaven but the assurance that Christ is "the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands, having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God".<a name=450:9></a> Can you read that scripture, and believe it possible, without being cast upon God?<a name=450:10></a> and like the apostle exclaiming, "O the depth of the riches!<a name=450:11></a>" "His ways past finding out!<a name=450:12></a>"

		In chapter 3 we come to the practical application of the truth.<a name=450:13></a> "If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above".<a name=450:14></a> Literally, you have not left this place: you have accepted that you are dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world.<a name=450:15></a> In Romans, you are dead with Christ unto sin; here you are dead with Him from the rudiments of the world; you are

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I come to another quality which is individual: "And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful".<a name=454:2></a> It is as the peace of Christ rules in your heart that you are qualified for any service.<a name=454:3></a> In His peace -- His profound tranquillity -- you come forth to serve.<a name=454:4></a> Hence finally, "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly".<a name=454:5></a> If Christ is your Head, you will be soon enlightened.<a name=454:6></a> "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly; in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another, in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord": your service is in His own circle.<a name=454:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I must add in conclusion that you do not get union with Christ in this scripture; you are in His life.<a name=454:8></a> You are conducted into the greatness of His life; and I press this, that if you do not understand Christ's interests as knowing His life, and that He is your Head, I do not see how you can enjoy union.<a name=454:9></a> If the Lord permit, I hope to speak on union the next time.<a name=454:10></a> I now only press that you cannot enjoy union except you are suited to Him.<a name=454:11></a> There can be no moral disparity between Christ and one united to Him; nothing would be more incongruous.<a name=454:12></a> Hence we read, "They twain shall be one flesh"; we must be of Him; it is not merely that He came and took part with flesh and blood, and bore the judgment on us; but we are to be <i>of Him</i> , otherwise He would abide alone.<a name=454:13></a> He was unique: "Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone; but if it die" -- now comes out a new generation -- "it bringeth forth much fruit".<a name=454:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		"UNION WITH CHRIST AND THE RESULT".
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the verses I have read, it is stated that God for His great love has "raised us up together".<a name=456:8></a> This is true of every believer, but every one does not know it.<a name=456:9></a> Hence in the prayer in the preceding chapter we read, "That ye may <i>know</i> .<a name=456:10></a>.<a name=456:11></a> .<a name=456:12></a> the exceeding greatness of his power .<a name=456:13></a>.<a name=456:14></a>.<a name=456:15></a> which He wrought in Christ"; it is not merely that God has done it, but you have the benefit of it when you are in the conscious knowledge of His grace.<a name=456:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I shall divide the subject into parts, in order that you may be able to follow it more easily.<a name=456:17></a> The first part we find is
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		FITNESS FOR UNION
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=457>[Page 457]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(Chapter 1: 1 - 14) I need not comment on these verses in detail, but I merely dwell on the nature of the fitness -- you must be of Him.<a name=457:1></a> You read in verse 4, "According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world" -- before ever there was any sin -- "that we should be holy and without blame before him in love" -- you must be fit for Him.<a name=457:2></a> All moral disparity must be removed or you could not be united to Christ; you must be of Him.<a name=457:3></a> This I have dwelt on previously, when referring to <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>; "all of one"; you are of His order.<a name=457:4></a> In the type, Eve was formed out of Adam; and in Ephesians we are called the "members of his body"; and "this is a great mystery".<a name=457:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now for "fitness".<a name=457:6></a> You are not only chosen in Him before the foundation of the world, but you are given the highest position; you read in verse 5 your position, "Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself": you cannot be higher than that; union does not put you higher than that.<a name=457:7></a> And we are "sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise".<a name=457:8></a> I press that the first step is "fitness"; and it is important to bear in mind that the only point to which Abraham's steward was sworn, when he was sent to find a bride for Isaac, was that she should be of his kindred.<a name=457:9></a> The great lack in souls is that they do not apprehend that they are of Him, of His order, and therefore you are not really in rest of heart, you are not ready to be conducted to Him as Rebekah was to Isaac.<a name=457:10></a> How was Rebekah proved to be fit to be conducted to Isaac?<a name=457:11></a> By her grace.<a name=457:12></a> When the steward asked her for some water to drink, she said, "Drink, my lord", and added, "I will draw for thy camels also"; she might have acceded merely to the letter of his request; but she had grace, she was fit to be conducted to Isaac.<a name=457:13></a> I cannot say every one is conducted.<a name=457:14></a> I wish all were; I see that they are not ready to be conducted.<a name=457:15></a> Here the apostle writes, "After I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto

		<a name=458>[Page 458]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		all the saints".<a name=458:1></a> I need not dwell more on "fitness"; it is a wonderful privilege, that you are of His kindred.<a name=458:2></a> "Both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one"; there is no moral disparity.<a name=458:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I come to the second part,
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		THE COUNSEL OF GOD.
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From verse 17 to the end is "the counsel of God".<a name=458:4></a> The first thing necessary in order to understand the counsel is enlightenment, "The eyes of your heart being enlightened", etc.<a name=458:5></a> Let me press on you how this great grace is effected, "That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him".<a name=458:6></a> It is very interesting that we are enabled to help others by the way we have been helped ourselves.<a name=458:7></a> I used to dwell on being enlightened until someone said to me, You are enlightened when you are given "the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him".<a name=458:8></a> I believe many are well acquainted with this epistle who really have not grasped God's counsel in it.<a name=458:9></a> Why?<a name=458:10></a> Because they have not "the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him".<a name=458:11></a> They think that they can understand it by studying it with great care; but all that will not be sufficient until they get "the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him", and hence they are not enlightened; they do not apprehend God's counsel.<a name=458:12></a> You might ask me, What is it?<a name=458:13></a> I could not explain it to you, but it is the most magnificent thing which could be conceived, even that the body of Christ is on the earth during the period of His rejection.<a name=458:14></a> I do not think anyone can convey it to you, but I hope to point out presently what the object of it is, even that throughout the ages there should be glory to God by the church.<a name=458:15></a> Our Lord in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>(he is a well instructed man that can explain <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>), first sets us as Himself in the presence of the Father, and then
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=459>[Page 459]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		sets us as Himself in the presence of the world.<a name=459:1></a> But bear in mind that Satan had so worked upon man that Christ was cast out and rejected, and then the secret of God, the mystery, was divulged, which had been kept secret from the foundation of the world, even that Christ's body is on the earth.<a name=459:2></a> Hence as I pressed on a previous occasion, God cannot support anything which is not Christ: "Why persecutest thou ME?<a name=459:3></a>" This "ME" embraces all of Christ.<a name=459:4></a> In the place where Christ was refused, God cannot support anyone but Christ.<a name=459:5></a> You may say, There are the powers that be?<a name=459:6></a> Yes; God has ordained them "for the punishment of evil doers, and for the praise of them that do well".<a name=459:7></a> Hence when Christ rises from the Father's throne all who belong to Him will be gathered to Him.<a name=459:8></a> I have been speaking of enlightenment; when you are enlightened you understand something of the counsel of God, His great purpose in the church.<a name=459:9></a> I need not say that we have failed in maintaining it, but let me add that the familiar way in which we speak of this truth indicates that we do not really apprehend it.<a name=459:10></a> It is often said we are gathered on the ground of the one body.<a name=459:11></a> I understand what is meant by the expression; but I believe that if you apprehended the truth.<a name=459:12></a> you would see that not only are you bound together, a confederacy, but that you are <i>of Christ</i> .<a name=459:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I now turn to the scripture I have read for the third part,
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		THE REALISATION OF UNION.
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I must dwell a little on this, because, though union is true of you all, yet without deep exercise you do not realise it.<a name=459:14></a> Take the type, Rebekah was conducted by the steward to Isaac.<a name=459:15></a> First, she is fit to go, not only because of her kindred but of her grace.<a name=459:16></a> Then she has to encounter family influence; they say, "Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten".<a name=459:17></a>

		Now the first point I insist on is that Christ, "The root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star", is your hope.<a name=470:4></a> The church has failed as the "candlestick", that is, as the recognised light-bearer among men.<a name=470:5></a> I know there is a great attempt in Christendom to be acknowledged as the candlestick; there are large buildings, called churches, ringing of bells, and other religious demonstrations, all to regain a lost position, and some devoted servants of Christ seek to be acknowledged -- as has been said, trafficking upon the toleration accorded by the mere professors.<a name=470:6></a> A distinction forfeited is never restored; but John prepares the church for Christ.<a name=470:7></a> The church visibly is a ruin, yet the remnant is ready for the Lord, "The Spirit and the bride say, Come".<a name=470:8></a> The remnant is part of the original, and is distinguished by the special grace of the original.<a name=470:9></a> I gather this from Scripture.<a name=470:10></a> Until you know and accept that the church has failed as the "candlestick", you are not occupied with the "morning star", looking for the Lord to come according to His own communication.<a name=470:11></a> Hence in the closing churches the kingdom is brought prominently before you.<a name=470:12></a> To the church in Philadelphia Christ appears with "the key of David", the rejected king.<a name=470:13></a> And consequently to Laodicea, when the assembly is characterised by pretension and lukewarmness, the reward to the overcomer is that he shall "sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne".<a name=470:14></a> First you are arrested by the Lord's communication, "I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star".<a name=470:15></a> You have before you the day of Christ's glory, not merely the relief which will be

		It is very striking that as soon as Christ takes to Himself His great power to reign, the first wave of that power is to gather all His own unto Himself in bodies like unto His body of glory from Adam downward.<a name=471:6></a> That is the rapture.<a name=471:7></a> The Thessalonians were very zealous; they had "turned to God from idols, to serve the living and true God, and to wait for his Son from heaven"; they did not know of the rapture before this epistle was written.<a name=471:8></a> They had thought that their fellow-Christians who had died would not have part with them in the kingdom.<a name=471:9></a> Hence the apostle tells them that the first demonstration of Christ's power will be with reference to His own.<a name=471:10></a> "The dead in Christ shall rise first, then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them".<a name=471:11></a> The morning star may indicate that great event, but you must bear in mind that the morning star refers to the day, or otherwise you will not understand the figure.<a name=471:12></a> The first demonstration of that day is for our great benefit; but no true heart could limit the day of Christ's glory to his own immediate benefit.<a name=471:13></a> "The day of Christ" is when He appears in glory, and no

		It is of the deepest importance that you should apprehend the nature and character of the difficult times divinely, for if you do not, you never will be able to cope with them.<a name=475:7></a> Timothy was qualified to cope with the state of things in the difficult times, he was fully acquainted with Paul's "doctrine, manner of life", and "From a child thou hast known the holy scriptures".<a name=475:8></a> Paul's teaching, which embraces the gospel and the church, inculcates God's present object.<a name=475:9></a> In "the holy scriptures" you have divine principles (man in all his deformity, and God in all His greatness): and by them you are taught that the man who has God's object at the time, whatever that object is, is the man of power, supported by God.<a name=475:10></a> Open the Bible anywhere, and you will find that this is a divine principle: and surely no one is equal to the difficult times who does not understand the mystery.<a name=475:11></a> I do not mean that he is not a Christian, but I am speaking of a man equal to the crisis.<a name=475:12></a> How could you counteract the worst state of things brought about by Satan in the last days if you did not stand for God's object for the time?<a name=475:13></a> and you could not stand for it if you did not know it.<a name=475:14></a> Hence Timothy was told in chapter 2,

		One example more, when our Lord first entered the temple (see <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:22">Luke  2:22</a>, etc.<a name=477:5></a>), not only Simeon acknowledged Him, but Anna, the prophetess, a widow of about eighty-four years, "which departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day".<a name=477:6></a> Simeon and Anna were the remnant for that time; they were set upon God's purpose in the lowest state of things.<a name=477:7></a> If you are set for God's object in the lowest state of things, you must be in the line of His power and His pleasure, hence the brightest and most important characteristic of it will be most prominent in you.<a name=477:8></a> Many say, all is in ruin: that is the moment for the man of faith to stand for God's object.<a name=477:9></a> If you know it and have faith in Him to stand for it, then you are the remnant.<a name=477:10></a> In every way you are sure to be helped if you are set for God's object.<a name=477:11></a>

		There is one mark more of those who are waiting for the Lord, it is that they are giving the household their "meat in due season".<a name=479:6></a> When the servant is evil he will say in his heart, "My lord delayeth his coming, and shall begin to smite his fellow-servants, and to eat and drink with the drunken"; he does not care for the "household".<a name=479:7></a> When I hear anyone referring to the coming of the Lord, even in giving out a hymn about it, I am arrested, for as he is true, he is interested in getting ready the saints for the Lord.<a name=479:8></a> The true servant in any house does not attend merely to his own duties, but if he sees anything neglected by the others he rectifies it, because he is thinking of his master.<a name=479:9></a> And the greatest proof of your love for Christ is that you care for those who belong to Him; if you love Me, feed My sheep.<a name=479:10></a> You give them meat in due season.<a name=479:11></a> No assembly, as far as I know, rises above the ministry there; I do not limit ministry to one man, for surely the highest element of ministry in a place, by man or woman, gives a character to the ministry.<a name=479:12></a> Hence it is added, "Let him that is athirst come"; you have an interest in the benefit of others.<a name=479:13></a> And then finally you are, I may say, evangelical, in the opposite order observed by men.<a name=479:14></a> If you begin with the bride looking for Christ to come, you will seek that every one belonging to Christ should be
