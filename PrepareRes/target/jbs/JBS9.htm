		ELEMENTARY TRUTH

	<div class="paragraph">
		"Christ God's power and God's wisdom", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:24">1 Corinthians  1:24</a>.<a name=1:1></a> Now these are two distinct lines of truth; the one, which is the power of God, for the conscience; the other, which is the wisdom of God, for the spiritual mind.<a name=1:2></a> Christ comprises both.<a name=1:3></a> The apostle says, "That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.<a name=1:4></a> Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect", etc.<a name=1:5></a> Now to the wisdom the babes in Christ should be gently led on; but the power, what the grace of God is in dealing with a ruined sinner, ought to be within the comprehension of the true hearted, however young in the school.<a name=1:6></a> Nevertheless it will be found, in daily converse with souls, that even this, elementary though it be, is very feebly apprehended; nay, that the divine idea in renewing a soul is seldom or never laid hold of; and if this be not laid hold of there can be no correct or adequate conception of what new birth is.<a name=1:7></a> I believe it is at the very foundation that the real cause of weakness in souls is to be found.<a name=1:8></a> And one of the evidences of how the will is in this weakness -- for it is nothing but the flesh -- is the obduracy and slowness of souls to lay hold of God's idea in sending His Son to bless them.<a name=1:9></a> If you ask believers in general what they consider is elementary, you will find that it is something which is to contribute to man as man is.<a name=1:10></a> Now the grace of God begins entirely outside, reveals His Son in me.<a name=1:11></a> I am daily more convinced that the reason why souls call God's idea -- and, blessed be His name, His accomplished purpose, that He has given us eternal life in His Son -- 'high truth', is because they do not want to cease conferring with flesh and blood.<a name=1:12></a>

		Surely our Lord's wondrous words in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>as to the "gift of God" were elementary; or, at least, He considered that they were not above the reach of the poor, ignorant, and abandoned woman of Samaria; yet

		if such truth were insisted on in the present day, there is no doubt that all who desire to gratify their reputable tastes and foster their ambition, would designate it 'high truth'.<a name=2:1></a> It was the definiteness of God's idea for man that our blessed Lord then enunciated: "Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst, but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life".<a name=2:2></a> This I believe is what is not sufficiently insisted on in this day, though most elementary; and, to the true-hearted soul, it will always be with the voice of the Son of God.<a name=2:3></a>

		Souls like forgiveness to be preached, and they like to enjoy it; and though forgiven, to lie on their beds just as palsied as ever (see <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#2:8">Mark  2:8</a> - 12), only more comfortably as to conscience, which is quieted by being delivered from the fear of judgment; but they have no idea of what is God's thought for them by the gift of eternal life in His Son, for if they had they would take up their beds and walk.<a name=2:4></a> I fear what people call 'high truth' is too often, even as it was with the scribes and Pharisees in our Lord's day, something which they do not wish to understand.<a name=2:5></a>

		OUR POSITION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God, out of the spontaneous feelings of His own heart, has come in and taken out from among this world certain persons who were devil-possessed, led captive, full of evil passions.<a name=4:5></a> God has come in, taken them up, revealed Himself to them, and made them the body of which His Son, seated at His own right hand, is the Head in heaven.<a name=4:6></a> The Son of God, Jesus of Nazareth, is now on the throne of the Father, of the Highest; and God has down here on earth an answer to what He is up there.<a name=4:7></a> He is making good His name on earth, in spite of all that Satan can do.<a name=4:8></a> What grace!<a name=4:9></a> God is in heaven, His Son Jesus is set down at His right hand, the Holy Spirit is here; and here, in you and in me, He makes good that which is the answer to the position of His own Son as Head of the body.<a name=4:10></a> This is grace passing understanding; grace which for height passes measure, for it reaches to the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ; grace which for depth comes down under all our ruin, and which reached to us when we were rolled round and round by Satan, like withered leaves in autumn.<a name=4:11></a> And here <i>in us</i> He makes good this answer.<a name=4:12></a> <i>To us</i> He says, 'You are the proof that my Son is sitting up here as Head'.<a name=4:13></a> And this is the position in which we are to "stand"; as it says in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#6:14">Ephesians  6:14</a>, "Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth", etc.<a name=4:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here is our position; and in stating it, grace assumes that the hearts are all right with God.<a name=4:15></a> Oh!<a name=4:16></a> when one sees how God takes this for granted, how the heart

		OUR DUTY
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One cannot help feeling that there ought to be a chivalry about us now beyond anything ever known in the church of God of later times.<a name=5:10></a> Luther did not get beyond justification.<a name=5:11></a> Like the woman in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7">Luke  7</a>, there was great true-hearted devotedness, but all to distinguish Christ on earth.<a name=5:12></a>

		He never got farther; even Melancthon would have reformed the national church.<a name=5:13></a> We now profess to know Christ as the One with whom we are quickened (quickened is always used, I believe, for the whole work of life, including the body); and hence we ought to declare, "The world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world".<a name=5:14></a> We should distinguish Christ by renouncing it for His burial, like the woman in <a href="../bible/John.htm#12">John  12</a>who devoted the most precious thing she had to His

		burial; or in other words by being dead to it altogether, because He has died out of it.<a name=6:1></a> This truth necessarily imposes on us a much more chivalrous and self-renouncing path than that of Luther or Melancthon.<a name=6:2></a> We have not merely to contend with indulgences or gross corruptions, but we have to brave the coldness and distance of 'our own', the saints who refuse what we seek to enforce -- that the one living by Christ now is also crucified as to himself with Christ.<a name=6:3></a> If one term of the proposition be true, the other is true also.<a name=6:4></a> Weaken or limit the scope of the one, and you must weaken and limit the scope of the other.<a name=6:5></a> How many say that they have Christ as their life who, instead of seeking to be as crucified ones here, argue and contend for acknowledgment in the flesh here in position and self-gratification, satisfied so long as there be no degradation of man naturally, which is their standard.<a name=6:6></a> Now this is a great and growing evil.<a name=6:7></a> The truth as to grace is increasing, and is pressed with such clearness that there is general acceptance of it; but the great testimony which should flow from an acceptance in power is nowhere to be seen.<a name=6:8></a> "Whose god is the belly" could be said with too much truth of the mass of the professing people of God.<a name=6:9></a> That is to say, their own tastes rule more than God's mind.<a name=6:10></a> The saints have to be warned and preserved against being legal, as we see in Romans and Galatians; but there is another and a worse form of evil, and that is, turning the grace of God into lasciviousness -- practically denying that in the flesh we were crucified with Christ, while professing that we live by Him; and this we know will be the final form of evil in and among the people of God on earth.<a name=6:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two distinct lines of truth which require to be presented with special distinctness.<a name=6:12></a> That first is, What is God's thought in saving us?<a name=6:13></a> This thought He has consummated in His Son, and we require to have the scope of it before our souls.<a name=6:14></a> Every priest in Israel did not comprehend the temple and its furniture; but

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the temple and its furniture presented the mind of God about Israel, and each, at least, saw what he was called to attain to.<a name=7:1></a> Now in the present day the truth is lowered to the measure of man's need; hence if the need be met, which grace does, the convert makes no advance; he rests in the satisfaction of his need, instead of being directed to the scope of God's thought, which only begins at his need.<a name=7:2></a> Where would souls be put if they were simply and definitely instructed in Christ Jesus and Him crucified, connected by faith with the living One, who was here crucified, and whose death terminated man in the flesh?<a name=7:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second line of truth so needed is, the place and walk incumbent on us who have received Christ here on earth -- the nature and character of that place.<a name=7:4></a> For it is not in the glory that we shall set forth the power of the risen Christ; it is here where He died, and where we are dead, that we ought to display the properties and virtues of Christ risen from among the dead.<a name=7:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		OUR MOTIVE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Intelligence in truth depends on the spiritual state of the soul.<a name=7:6></a> It is quite impossible, before you have apprehended your union with Christ, that you should comprehend what the effects of that union are.<a name=7:7></a> <i>Now</i> we are hid with Him.<a name=7:8></a> When He shall appear, all shall be put in order, all shall suit His presence.<a name=7:9></a> Now all is confusion.<a name=7:10></a> The world has cast out Christ; but He has gone up to the right hand of God, and is gathering His saints until He appears, shows Himself to them, and puts all straight.<a name=7:11></a> The moment Christ shows Himself, He must have the upper hand of all evil.<a name=7:12></a> It was a matter of promise to the saints of old.<a name=7:13></a> Would it be your delight if He fulfilled it?<a name=7:14></a> If we are settling ourselves down here, we shall not desire that day; we shall not look for His appearing.<a name=7:15></a> We have to go through this world, an immense system of which Satan is the head; but our

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord Jesus having come and reconciled us with Himself, all His object was to set us in the same place with Himself, and <i>nothing short of this</i>.<a name=8:12></a> You cannot put Him in a place in which you do not necessarily, and in virtue of it, put me.<a name=8:13></a> And what is the consequence?<a name=8:14></a> I have this hope -- the realisation of this union.<a name=8:15></a> Associated, identified, mixed up with Christ.<a name=8:16></a> You cannot separate the two.<a name=8:17></a> The world and Christ are now at issue.<a name=8:18></a> Christ retires as it were; He does not assert His rights.<a name=8:19></a> But by and by the world will have to succumb, and it shall be manifested then that the church had its place in Him before and beyond the creation of the scene in which it was to be gathered.<a name=8:20></a> Our hope is that which flows necessarily from connection with Himself, the being with Him for ever, connected with Himself everlastingly.<a name=8:21></a> He will come again to receive us unto Himself.<a name=8:22></a> And what more?<a name=8:23></a> Nothing?<a name=8:24></a> "That where I am, there ye may be also".<a name=8:25></a> For ever with the Lord -- that is all!<a name=8:26></a> And that is full blessedness.<a name=8:27></a>

		CO-OPERATION IN WORK
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The thought or the practice of co-operating in work for Christ, while there is not communion with the truth which He has communicated, implies that I can separate His work from His mind.<a name=9:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Communion may exist with very partial knowledge.<a name=9:2></a> Communion with another is common mind with him, while the scope and extent of it is according to knowledge.<a name=9:3></a> My child and I may have communion to a certain point.<a name=9:4></a> I know all he knows; he only knows a part of what I know; but so far as he does know and is engaged with it he has communion with me and I with him.<a name=9:5></a> So it is as to co-operation in Christ's work.<a name=9:6></a> To say that it can exist without communion in truth implies that two can engage in Christ's work without common ideas of Christ; but it is not a question of the extent or fulness of the idea.<a name=9:7></a> If my idea of Him be of the same order, I am after all, however feeble, in communion with the most advanced and apprehensive, for the greater includes the lesser if it be of its own order.<a name=9:8></a> I do not rise up to its fulness, but I am not occupied with anything not of it, or apart from it.<a name=9:9></a> If I am occupied with any thing apart from it, then communion is at an end.<a name=9:10></a> I am occupied in my mind with that which is not of His mind, and this must necessarily damage my service for Him.<a name=9:11></a> The question narrows itself to this: 'Can I preach the gospel in conjunction with another who sees quite differently from me respecting the church of God?<a name=9:12></a>' We agree as to the way, and the necessity of salvation; can we work together while we differ about the church and its order and place on earth?<a name=9:13></a> I should say No; for though there is an agreement in one point between us, we are in fact working for different ends, so that the agreement loses its value.<a name=9:14></a> We preach the gospel together and souls are saved, but as to the question, 'What is Christ's mind for the

		For instance, teetotalism is philanthropic co-operation after this order.<a name=10:13></a> All that is required in the co-operation is zeal and purpose in promoting a certain good.<a name=10:14></a> The simple and entire object is to promote sobriety, and it is no matter what are the sentiments of the co-operator,

		LUKEWARMNESS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Since the first decline of the church, there is nothing that the saint should more fear than anything bordering on lukewarmness, because that is the condition of the church characteristically when it shall be spued out of Christ's mouth (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:16">Revelation  3:16</a>), when it shall for ever cease to be for Him here on earth; and the moment we see anything in ourselves tending to this lukewarmness, we should earnestly attend to His word, "be zealous .<a name=62:2></a>.<a name=62:3></a>.<a name=62:4></a> and repent".<a name=62:5></a> To do this would be not only to refuse and denounce all neutrality, but to be valiant for the truth.<a name=62:6></a> Repentance does not only denounce the wrong, but it scrupulously and earnestly attests and maintains the right.<a name=62:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the snare in lukewarmness is this, that there is nothing exactly to offend the conscience; there is no denial of, or opposition to, the truth, but on the contrary an apparent reception of it, going along with it, but in such a partial, imperfect way that a great deal is permitted which would have been refused if one had been walking earnestly in the truth.<a name=62:8></a> There is an admission of truth, and there is an acceptance in general of the place in which the truth sets one, but there is no testimony to its power and control.<a name=62:9></a> The lukewarm one accepts the truth and the position which the truth prescribes, but in such a loose way that the sound is uncertain, and the distinctness and peculiarity which would necessarily flow from an honest, earnest maintenance of the truth is lost and frustrated.<a name=62:10></a> "If the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?<a name=62:11></a>" Hence, there is more damage

		Now when the church characteristically sinks into this indifference about truth -- this open and avowed declaration of admission and acceptance of truth, without insisting on its claims and efficacy -- it can necessarily no longer be in any way fit as a vessel for God on earth, and its removal from the place of testimony must immediately ensue; therefore it is in its Laodicean, its lukewarm, state that it is spued out of Christ's mouth as that which is nauseous and useless.<a name=65:6></a> If Jeremiah could mourn in his day that there was none valiant for the truth, how much more should we, when so much truth has been given us!<a name=65:7></a> When the church was first set up on earth as Christ's and of Him, it was the pillar and base of the truth; and then no lukewarmness or indifference about anything of Christ obtained in the church.<a name=65:8></a> If there had, in any degree, then indeed all sense of its own proper dignity as the pillar and base of the truth, as of and for Christ here, would have been lost.<a name=65:9></a> And this has, alas!<a name=65:10></a> been lost.<a name=65:11></a> We can no longer assume this dignity.<a name=65:12></a> But surely no saint would like to show himself, because of his lukewarmness, unworthy and unfit for the dignity.<a name=65:13></a> Moreover, it is by the Spirit of truth that the church is united to Christ the Head, and the members one to another; and if He be disregarded, where is the power to uphold us, or to guide us into all truth?<a name=65:14></a> Surely, however fair the appearance may be, however we may say, "I am rich, and increased

		There is nothing in the history of the church, or of souls, more grievous than the fact that truth can be so perverted that the name of it only is left, and often so much so that the name stands for the very contrary to that to which it was originally attached.<a name=74:9></a> It has often been said that Satan will spoil what he cannot hinder, and hence we ought to be more careful to assure our hearts from the word of God of the idea which belongs to and characterises the names of doctrines received by all christians.<a name=74:10></a> The true and scriptural names are retained, but when we come to examine what these names stand for, we find that they do not represent the ideas given to them in Scripture.<a name=74:11></a> They are really perversions of the truth.<a name=74:12></a> Man's ideas have been adopted as exponents of the truth, instead of the ideas set forth in the word of God.<a name=74:13></a>

		We must in this day own that the prediction of our Lord has been verified, namely, "The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened".<a name=75:1></a> The leaven is the introduction of an element which has extended the original thing unnaturally.<a name=75:2></a> The human idea is this leaven, and it has so added to the original and divine teaching that the doctrine now called in christendom after the scriptural name bears little or no resemblance to the doctrine to which the same name is attached in Scripture.<a name=75:3></a> This is very serious; and it is not from outside that this evil occurs.<a name=75:4></a> "Of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20">Acts  20</a>.<a name=75:5></a> If there were no perversion of the truth, there would be no disciples except disciples of Christ.<a name=75:6></a> No man would attain to any distinct leadership, "for one is your Master, even Christ".<a name=75:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is very important to see that if the truth were not perverted there could be no leadership but in Christ, and that it is in the perversion of truth that disciples are drawn away.<a name=75:8></a> The effect of the simple maintenance of truth is to draw to Christ.<a name=75:9></a> John the baptist proclaimed the truth; and his disciples, in adopting it, forsook him to follow Christ.<a name=75:10></a> And in this day it is a well-known fact that, as godly earnest ministers have pressed truth, the simple and devoted among their followers have left them, in order that they might follow the truth more perfectly than the instruments through which they had first learned it; and doubtless, if every godly minister would discard everything not scripturally true, then the faithful would cease to be ranked under the leadership of men.<a name=75:11></a> One may ask, How is it that godly earnest men do not discard everything not scripturally true?<a name=75:12></a> I answer, Because they are guided by conscience and not by the word of God.<a name=75:13></a> By their consciences they are calmed into the assurance that they are doing the best for the general good; and this

	<div class="paragraph">
		But it is not only from making the conscience umpire that earnest men suffer; there is another snare which is still more difficult to expose.<a name=76:8></a> Perversion of the truth is always to suit a practical state.<a name=76:9></a> It is the lower order of practice which, when there is conscience, leads to a lower order of truth, or a misplacement of the order, because it matches the state and quiets the conscience; and the lower order of practice is confirmed and perpetuated by the lower order of truth.<a name=76:10></a> Now when anyone attempts to form an idea of a truth from his own practical observance of it, or seeks to make it practicable, of course he shapes the truth to his practice, instead of demanding that his practice should conform to the truth.<a name=76:11></a> Man, as is natural, likes to leave out from a doctrine that which makes it impossible to man in nature, and to substitute something under the same name, and thus deceive the conscience with what is

		To the earnest and true-hearted servant of Christ no question can be of deeper interest than, What is power, and how are means to be used?<a name=80:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not only in the first part of the question that the importance lies, for many are assured that power is of God; many can say, "Twice have I heard this; that power belongeth unto God" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#62:11">Psalm  62:11</a>), who cannot reply to the second, which is really the one which exercises the heart before Him, and in which we all so fail.<a name=80:2></a> Let us search and see how means may be used, consistently with the assured sense that power is of God only.<a name=80:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is very instructive to mark how the servant of God in every age used means; and if before the death of Christ, while the first man was still recognised, we can trace and discover how the means were in abeyance to the power -- nay, that they were always, when the servant was walking with God, so disproportionate to the power that the source of the power was not clouded or obscured by the means, but the contrary -- how much more now!<a name=80:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Faith always has to do with God, to whom power belongs, and not with means; and hence I may pass over Abraham, for his life properly was one wholly of faith, and he passed through the deepest exercises known to the heart of man, reckoning on God only, apart from any means.<a name=80:5></a> And this is, as I may say, one's private history and walk with God.<a name=80:6></a> Jacob, on his return from Laban's house, has got out of faith, and is full of means.<a name=80:7></a> In the wrestling he is taught the power of God, and that if He be for him who can be against him?<a name=80:8></a> Every devoted saint knows that God's resources are outside and beyond the means he could use, and has found it so; but when the servant of God testifies of Him to His professing people, the means are used to

		LEGALISM AND LAWLESSNESS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two courses of action apparently contrary one to the other, but which nevertheless spring from the same root, even the flesh.<a name=90:1></a> One is <i>legalism</i>, which I may describe as the effort to shape oneself to given laws or rules; the other is lawlessness, in which one's own will determines everything.<a name=90:2></a> In legalism the occupation is necessarily with oneself.<a name=90:3></a> Seeking to urge oneself into conformity to law, self is before the eye, and satisfaction is felt according as there is conformity to a given standard.<a name=90:4></a> Legalism must always give the flesh a place, for if there were no flesh, there would be no law.<a name=90:5></a> The Spirit acts according to God, and against His fruits there can be no law.<a name=90:6></a> If the flesh be dead, there is no need for law, for he that is dead is freed from sin.<a name=90:7></a> But it is not of doctrine I would speak here, but of practice.<a name=90:8></a> The moment legality is sanctioned, it must be with reference to that which needs to be made subject; hence law has a relation to the flesh, and the flesh to the law.<a name=90:9></a> And this is just the evil of legalism, even that it addresses the flesh, and gives it a standing.<a name=90:10></a> And this is not christian, because as christians we are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit; therefore the flesh has no standing, and in the Spirit we exhibit the fruits of the Spirit, against which there is no law.<a name=90:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now lawlessness, though apparently opposite to legalism, springs from the same error, even from a misapprehension of how the flesh is regarded before God.<a name=90:12></a> Neither with the legal nor with the lawless is it treated as having been crucified with Christ; and because grace confers what the law exacts, the flesh assumes that it is not responsible, and acts according to its will, and this is lawlessness.<a name=90:13></a> The carnal mind becomes the arbiter and leader on every point.<a name=90:14></a> Self, like a primeval forest, is allowed to grow and to do as it lists.<a name=90:15></a> In neither case is the flesh treated as a thing to be mortified, set aside, because crucified in the cross.<a name=90:16></a>

		Where there is most conscience, legality obtains; but where there is most intelligence in the natural mind, there lawlessness rules.<a name=91:1></a> Nevertheless the legal man, because of weakness, is often lawless, for if he be not up to and according to rule, he must be so, even against his inclination; hence legalism is no safeguard against lawlessness, because of the weakness of the flesh; and it becomes plain that there is no true deliverance from the flesh but as I walk in the Spirit.<a name=91:2></a>

		The Galatians were legal; the Corinthians were lawless.<a name=91:3></a> The Galatians, no doubt, conscientiously felt that the flesh intruded and trespassed upon them, and in order to check and frustrate it, they resorted to restrictions and were in bondage to rules.<a name=91:4></a> Having begun in the Spirit, they were seeking to be made perfect in the flesh.<a name=91:5></a> They had ceased to walk in the Spirit, and they essayed to control the flesh by descending to carnal methods, and thus gave a place to the flesh, which was in itself a victory to it.<a name=91:6></a> Instead of disallowing it from the high eminence and control of the Spirit of God -- for if we walk in the Spirit, we shall not fulfil the lusts of the flesh -- they fostered the very thing they wanted to check, because they thus gave it a recognised existence.<a name=91:7></a> The great truth is that, being alive in the Spirit, I disavow the right of the flesh to rule -- in a word, that I am crucified with Christ.<a name=91:8></a> For if I live after the flesh, I shall die; but if I, through the Spirit, do mortify the deeds of the body, I shall live.<a name=91:9></a> The legal man makes himself, and not Christ, his study and object, and his satisfaction is according as he succeeds in bringing himself to the adopted standard.<a name=91:10></a>

		Let us trace a little in 1 Corinthians how the apostle exposes lawlessness at Corinth.<a name=92:6></a> First, in chapter 1, he notices how they are in the flesh, because they are following their own will in choosing leaders.<a name=92:7></a> And in chapter 3 he plainly tells them that they are babes in Christ, being carnal, and walking as men.<a name=92:8></a> But having shown how wilful they were in their own walk and ways, he then in chapter 5 shows how utterly indifferent they were to the conduct and character of those who came to the Lord's table; nay, that they were so leavened that they went to law with one another before the ungodly; they were not under law to Christ, they did as they chose; it ran into their domestic relationships, so that it was necessary to tell them, "Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called".<a name=92:9></a> They went to idol temples and ate things offered to idols; they ate their own supper at the Lord's supper.<a name=92:10></a> Every one had a psalm, etc.<a name=92:11></a>, in the assembly; <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14:26">1 Corinthians  14:26</a>.<a name=92:12></a> Lastly, they had among them some who said that there is no resurrection of the dead!<a name=92:13></a> Alas!<a name=92:14></a> to what a lawless state had they come!<a name=92:15></a> The doctrine and power of the Spirit was accepted without the great truth of the crucifixion of the flesh.<a name=92:16></a> The result is the worst practice, for the knowledge of the Spirit's gifts and power, unless I am walking in the Spirit, only leads to lawlessness; it leads to boasting in the flesh.<a name=92:17></a> If I am walking in the Spirit, the flesh is forced into death

		These two forms of evil, which appeared so soon in the history of christianity, have produced strange combinations in christendom.<a name=93:3></a> You will find one lawless in choosing a leader, and then easily submitting to certain rules, as if he were quite a legalist.<a name=93:4></a> You will find another avowing legalism, and yet very wilful in personal habits and ways.<a name=93:5></a> One glories in what he can make of himself -- for instance, a teetotaller; the other is gratified by the acts of his will; thus in both cases there is plainly self-satisfaction.<a name=93:6></a> Legalism is in man in the flesh when there is conscience.<a name=93:7></a> Lawlessness obtains when there is a release from law if the flesh is allowed to act.<a name=93:8></a> Hence Paul urges, "Only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh"; and Peter, "as free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness".<a name=93:9></a> The true ground of liberty or freedom from evil is that I am dead to the law by the body of Christ.<a name=93:10></a> If the old man has been crucified, there is no room for legalism or lawlessness; and hence the danger of relaxing the claim of the law, for it is not that God has relaxed His claim, but that which the law addresses has been crucified, and therefore it is neither to be improved, nor left at will, but to be <i>mortified</i>.<a name=93:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a high but grave position to be called of God to minister His mind and counsel to His people; none more highly favoured, and none so opposed and thwarted by every device of Satan.<a name=119:4></a> It is plain that when God would help and succour His people by unfolding His will and way to any one, Satan's great effort would be to hinder such an one, and if possible to pervert him.<a name=119:5></a> The favour of God is shown to His people when He raises up a faithful servant; and His rebuking is shown when "Jehovah hath poured out upon you a spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes; the prophets and your chiefs, the seers, hath he covered", <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#29:10">Isaiah  29:10</a>.<a name=119:6></a> And hence the enemy labours to counteract the effect which would flow from the faithfulness of God's ministers.<a name=119:7></a> While Noah was faithful he was signally used, but when he failed he opened the door for evil in his own family.<a name=119:8></a>

		THE SAINT NOW
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The cause of confusion to many souls is the inability to distinguish between the standing of a saint now and in any other time.<a name=166:1></a> And the distinction cannot be seen or maintained if Christ's position be not clearly seen and maintained.<a name=166:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us examine and trace how the difference of His position affects the saints.<a name=166:3></a> Before the death of Christ man was under trial.<a name=166:4></a> God had made trial of man in every way since his first trial in Eden.<a name=166:5></a> Left to himself for more than fifteen hundred years, ending with a development so fearful -- violence covered the land -- that God repented that He had made man upon the earth; and the end of all flesh was determined on; <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#6">Genesis  6</a>.<a name=166:6></a> Noah was saved, and placed on the earth under a new covenant.<a name=166:7></a> From this there was entire departure.<a name=166:8></a> Babel was built; men combined in self-dependence and disregard of God, who had set them on the earth on new terms.<a name=166:9></a> Then Abram <i>was</i> called out, and to his seed -- Israel -- everything that could be done for man was done; as it is written, "What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it?<a name=166:10></a>" At length the heir came, whom they ought to have received; but they caught Him, and cast Him out of the vineyard, and killed Him.<a name=166:11></a> Every effort to restore man has proved in vain.<a name=166:12></a> The "corn of wheat", the blessed One, must abide alone unless He dies; but if He dies, He delivers up man in His own Person to judgment, and out of death He brings forth much fruit.<a name=166:13></a> The Son of man must be lifted up; there is no door for life to man but through the death of Christ.<a name=166:14></a> It is the Son of God, coming into the world from God's side, who bears the judgment on the first man, and then, rising out of it, becomes the Head of a new race.<a name=166:15></a> Hence the trial of the first man must be over, and life now flows from the Son of God, risen out of the judgment on Adam; for "in Adam all die"; but "He that hath the Son hath

		life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life".<a name=167:1></a> Man in his sins must either receive life from the Son now, or suffer judgment from Him hereafter.<a name=167:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As the trial of the first man is over, everything now depends on the position of the second Man.<a name=167:3></a> If the trial of the first man is not over, then Christ is not the Head of a new race; but if Christ be Head of a new race, then the first man is no longer under trial.<a name=167:4></a> The atonement has been made, not by man himself, thus entitling him to retain his status; but he having been proved thoroughly incompetent (the wine out in his brightest moment, as we see in <a href="../bible/John.htm#2">John  2</a>), and incapable of retaining any blessing or favour bestowed, God, from His own side, brought in salvation.<a name=167:5></a> He laid help on One that is mighty; He gave His Son.<a name=167:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The simple fact that the atonement was provided for the sinner by God, proves the entire incompetence of man to meet the first need of his case.<a name=167:7></a> And while it determines the utter inability of man, it sets forth the grace of God, providing in mercy for the sinner; and with this purpose, to bring in a new order -- a new man, born of water and of the Spirit.<a name=167:8></a> The trial of the first man is over in the cross of Christ.<a name=167:9></a> In crucifying the Son of God man has no cloke for his sin, for "they have both seen and hated both me and my Father".<a name=167:10></a> The act that proved man irretrievable brought in the sacrifice.<a name=167:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now it is evident that, as the first man is no longer under trial, and as Christ risen from the dead is the last Adam, every position of the believer here must be determined by the position of Christ.<a name=167:12></a> If Christ were on earth, the believer would be an earthly man fully and perfectly according to the mind of God for a man on earth; but if Christ be in heaven, he lives according the heavenly man, with no place here.<a name=167:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ being now in heaven, the second Man, there is no link to Him there but through the Holy Spirit, through whom is made known to the soul the mind and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		objects of the heavenly Man.<a name=168:1></a> Christ is the heavenly Man, and because He has been refused a place here, He now is known to His saints where He is, and thus the heavenly status is known and enjoyed by the saints still on earth.<a name=168:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Properly, the heavenly standing is not fully known until we pass away from this scene; but this peculiar blessing came in consequent on the rejection of Christ, and is made known to us through the Spirit sent down from heaven.<a name=168:3></a> This then causes a great difference between the saint now and in any former or future dispensation.<a name=168:4></a> The saint now has to do with a Saviour who is in heaven; and hence, through the Spirit, is constituted heavenly in tastes and objects, while empowered to fill in a superior manner every claim and relationship appointed by God for the earthly man.<a name=168:5></a> The saint's blessing and position now is determined by the second Man.<a name=168:6></a> If Christ were on the earth, ruling in His might here, the man of the earth would be maintained here, as God had appointed, and this will be fully exhibited in the millennium.<a name=168:7></a> Then man will live here in the enjoyment of every earthly blessing; nothing to mar the ordering and favour of God and man; and he himself kept through grace in accordance with the law, which defines the course and walk of a man on earth.<a name=168:8></a> The fact of Christ's absence involves an entirely different position for the saint now.<a name=168:9></a> He is not where Christ is, and Christ is not where he is; <i>he</i> is not <i>of</i> earth but <i>on</i> earth; he is <i>of</i> Christ in heaven, but he is not <i>in</i> heaven.<a name=168:10></a> It is anomalous to find a saint where the Lord is refused, and hence possible only to faith to apprehend his true status in consequence.<a name=168:11></a> It is so anomalous and strange that, practically, souls go back to the dispensation before the coming of Christ, or, more properly speaking, to His first advent.<a name=168:12></a> They own His coming into the world as the Saviour, and they prolong, as it were, that period indefinitely.<a name=168:13></a> They do not see His rejection; and while they own His death

		sacrificially, they adhere to the former dispensation, only adding to it the sacrifice of Christ.<a name=169:1></a> Now this presupposes the state of man to be just the same as before the death of Christ.<a name=169:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In current theology two things are thus really overlooked; first, that the trial of the first man is over in the cross, and an entirely new man brought in; and secondly, the fact of Christ's rejection.<a name=169:3></a> Now without seeing both, there can be no comprehending the status of the saint of this period.<a name=169:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first point to be settled is, whether the first man is still under trial.<a name=169:5></a> Is God seeking or using any methods, with the view of testing man's ability to do anything for himself?<a name=169:6></a> Has it not been proved that the old bottles cannot hold new wine, and that there is no competence in the first man to retain, or to turn to good account, the favours and ordinance of God?<a name=169:7></a> Man has failed in his own condition, and in relation to God, either to enjoy and secure to himself the blessing of earth, or to revere God through means of the imposing temple ritual.<a name=169:8></a> In the one case the wine is out; in the other, the house of God becomes a den of thieves; see <a href="../bible/John.htm#2">John  2</a>.<a name=169:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now there has been an atonement in the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ for the man who has failed; and as the atonement has been provided by God for man, it testifies of the entire inability of man to do anything for himself; and as it is in God's hand only, He does not restore that which had ever proved itself unworthy and incompetent; but He introduces, in Christ risen from the dead, an entirely new man.<a name=169:10></a> If man, since the sacrifice, is still under trial, one consequence or another must ensue.<a name=169:11></a> The trial must either be successful -- and if man answered to the trial, then he is sinless -- or if unsuccessful, then there must be another sacrifice; for if man is under trial again and fails, there must be another atonement, or he is lost.<a name=169:12></a> Now to escape this dilemma, there are in the present day two systems of theology.<a name=169:13></a> One, the Romish, maintains
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=170>[Page 170]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that the sacrifice or mass is a continual one; and hence there is no room for seeing that there is an end of the old man judicially in the cross, or that the new has come in and is before God in His Son, risen from the dead.<a name=170:1></a> The first man is looked at as still the one under trial.<a name=170:2></a> The other -- Protestantism, set on foot by the reformers -- admits that the sacrifice is one and sufficient, but with no consistency; for practically they neither own that the trial of the first man is over on the cross, nor Christ's rejection from the earth.<a name=170:3></a> Hence the law is their rule of life, and the believer seeks a position on earth as if Christ were reigning.<a name=170:4></a> They call the sacrifice of Christ a full and sufficient atonement, but they do not see it as brought in by God in His love, when the first man was proved utterly worthless; or that the believer is risen with Christ, in whom and from whom he receives a new life.<a name=170:5></a> The last Adam is a life-giving spirit, and therefore everything for the saint now is determined by the position of Christ the second Man.<a name=170:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nothing is more evident than that, the atonement being provided by God for that which has been proved thoroughly worthless and unfit for Himself, He does not restore it; He judged it on the cross of His Son, and, in Him risen, receives every returning prodigal in a new nature and life.<a name=170:7></a> To sum up, Christ's position in heaven determines ours.<a name=170:8></a> He is where we are not.<a name=170:9></a> We are where God's Son has been refused.<a name=170:10></a> We are surrounded by man who refused Him, and who is no longer under trial, because God has brought in a new man in His Son who is in heaven.<a name=170:11></a> Hence the status of the saint now is heavenly, united to Christ in heaven by the Holy Spirit sent down; through grace he acquits himself in a superior way in every duty incumbent on the first man, as God has appointed: but he has no link or place here, as the millennial saint will have; for then Christ will be reigning here, and the saint will be where He reigns, instead of, as now, where He is refused.<a name=170:12></a>

		THE FIRST INTIMATION OF HIS COMING
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#4">1 Thessalonians  4</a>we get the doctrine of the coming of the Lord brought before us.<a name=171:1></a> The epistle to the Philippians gives us the power of communion with the life of Christ in the service of the apostle down here.<a name=171:2></a> We get two glimpses in <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3">Philippians  3</a>which tell us how the heart of Paul, as fully led by the Spirit of God, was in connection with the hope of His coming.<a name=171:3></a> First, "<i>I</i> do not count to have got possession myself; but one thing -- forgetting the things behind .<a name=171:4></a>.<a name=171:5></a>.<a name=171:6></a> I pursue, looking towards the goal".<a name=171:7></a> Secondly, we look for the Saviour, His heart was set on that personal meeting of <i>the Lord</i> at the end of his course.<a name=171:8></a> It was not so much a question of glory with him, but that which would satisfy his heart, the presence of Christ.<a name=171:9></a> He was loved by Christ, he was brought into service by Christ, and he was one to whom the Person of Christ was so dear that he had got Christ for his prize.<a name=171:10></a> But his feet were still treading this world where he found thorns and briars, sand and flints enough to make his poor body weary; and not only so, but labouring in the house of God he had sorrow upon sorrow.<a name=171:11></a> So here we get the coming of the Lord in connection with His coming as Saviour, who could come to take him and clothe him upon, with circumstances perfectly in harmony with the one solitary desire of his heart -- to have Christ as his gain.<a name=171:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In 1 Thessalonians we get a different aspect of the coming of the Lord (chapter 4: 15, etc.<a name=171:13></a>), where Paul was writing to those who were comparatively in ignorance.<a name=171:14></a> We get a remarkable expression: "This we say to you in the word of the Lord".<a name=171:15></a> There is something emphatic in this statement; it indicates the display of the Lord's power -- His energy.<a name=171:16></a>

		Conscience, as we have seen, is a sense in fallen man of God's claim on him; but this sense itself is liable to be influenced by the prejudices or religious bias in which I am educated; it acquires its tone and line from the order and nature of things which are addressed to it with the object of influencing it.<a name=188:1></a> Religion itself addresses the conscience, and governs and sways it according to the power it has over the will of man.<a name=188:2></a> The more the will is acted on, the more it subserves; and the will then finds the conscience a great auxiliary in pleasing itself.<a name=188:3></a> The stiffneckedness is gratified!<a name=188:4></a> No one ever saw a devotee to any religion who was not self-willed; and thus his will finds an object in his religion, and the conscience approves because it has no other idea of what is due to God.<a name=188:5></a> The religious notion in every case sways the conscience, and it will obtain such mastery over the man that the most terrible deeds of violence and bloodshed can be done under sanction of the conscience.<a name=188:6></a> Saul of Tarsus could say that he had lived in all good conscience before God until this day, though in the sight of God he was chief of sinners; and while he persecuted the church in the most cruel way, he was only acting up to the religious impressions which he had imbibed, and his will found gratification for itself in what his conscience approved.<a name=188:7></a> His conscience had been formed in the Jewish religion, and it could rise no higher; and the more it adhered to its impressions, the more was he encouraged to act in direct opposition to the will of God.<a name=188:8></a> Surely the conscience was no guide or standard here; and it is plain enough that this man, of highest reputation as to conduct and conscience, required the power of God to convince him of what was due to God, and from His word to learn to act in accordance thereto.<a name=188:9></a>

		THE MARKS OF A TRUE CONVERSION

	<div class="paragraph">
		In a day like this, when the mind of man is, as I may say, opening itself to be acted on, and not content unless acted on by something, it is of great moment that the servant of Christ should weigh and understand from the scripture the marks of true conversion, of one born anew -- born of God.<a name=209:10></a> That faith or credence can be produced without the power of God is not only admitted in Scripture, but it is referred to, in order to be refused, In <a href="../bible/John.htm#2">John  2</a>we read, "Many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.<a name=209:11></a> But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men".<a name=209:12></a> Still more distinctly, in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:3">1 Corinthians  2:3</a> - 5, we find that Paul avoids the line and taste of the Corinthians, in order that their "faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God".<a name=209:13></a> And we also learn, from the parable of the sower,

		But besides this and because of this -- that is, because I am in this new position, this place of liberty before God in Christ -- I am led by the Spirit of God, by whom I live, to walk in Him, and as I do so, I do not fulfil the lusts of the flesh, though they are still there.<a name=227:3></a> If they were not, where would be the virtue of not fulfilling them, or where would be that great manifestation of grace which is exemplified in every devoted saint, even that in the same nature in which he dishonoured God, he is now empowered by the Spirit of God in a new nature to answer to the mind of God?<a name=227:4></a> I have to mortify my members which are on the earth, but this is not to attain to death.<a name=227:5></a> Then death would be a work here in me, and not done for me; and the rest of soul which I can only have because that is dead wherein I was held, would be dependent on my own progress in self-mortification, instead of, as the Scriptures set forth, the fact that I am dead with Christ, and He is my hope; and therefore I am to put to death the members on earth still in existence as to themselves, and as this progresses there is sanctification.<a name=227:6></a> Sanctification does not proceed or arise from an improvement in the members, but from a greater subjugation of them in death-like powerlessness; for it is the simple duty now that all the members of the flesh should be in a death-state, for we have put off the old man, and have put on the new, which is renewed in knowledge after

		Thus there are two ways in which I am dead to sin, and there is a great difference between the two.<a name=228:4></a> In the one, I am really and perfectly so, in the mind of God, in the cross of Christ; in the other, I, through the Spirit, do mortify the deeds of the body; for I am in the Spirit, I do not fulfil the lusts of the flesh.<a name=228:5></a> But this is always partial work, even though I have a pure conscience, because God is greater than my heart and knows all things; and though I might, through the Spirit, be quite master of the flesh one moment, who can tell what may arise to excite it?<a name=228:6></a> And if it can be excited, then, though suppressed, it is not really defunct.<a name=228:7></a> The more I enjoy in my spirit the new state, the more do I deny that which would represent me in a character quite opposed to it, and hence there is an avoidance of everything which would minister to the flesh, not because I expect to expel sin from it; but because, being free from it, I would no longer be enslaved by it.<a name=228:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I am no debtor to the flesh, and I prove my freedom by not yielding to it, not in expecting its extinction -- for then there would cease to be anything to repel or to act against -- but I keep my body under and bring it into subjection, afraid to give the flesh a place, knowing that this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting, for there is no keeping out Satan if the flesh is suffered.<a name=228:9></a> Now here comes in the exhortation of <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#4:1">1 Peter  4:1</a>, "Arm yourselves .<a name=228:10></a>.<a name=228:11></a>.<a name=228:12></a> with the same mind [the death of Christ]: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin" -- the practical bearing in the body of

		The first desire of Saul of Tarsus when brought to God was, "Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?<a name=234:1></a>" There is an immediate sense, on being a new man in Christ, that there is a new line of action.<a name=234:2></a> New powers and abilities necessarily demand new activities.<a name=234:3></a> The nature of the new man being of God, he is dependent on God; and as he is so, he will manifest the grace and kindness of God in this evil world.<a name=234:4></a> "God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him".<a name=234:5></a> According as there is dependence, there is ability from God to do as occasion requires, whatever would please Him and declare Him.<a name=234:6></a> Without works faith is dead, being alone; but the faith comes before the works, so that with the new man it is faith that worketh by love.<a name=234:7></a> Love then is the motive of good works, and faith the sustainer of them.<a name=234:8></a> To understand the nature and purpose of the love of God, I require to be in communion with His mind, and this I acquire only by dependence.<a name=234:9></a> His love has been manifested in the Son, and as we abide in Him, we bring forth much fruit; we walk here even as He walked.<a name=234:10></a> As I am in communion, I learn and understand His will concerning every one that I am placed in contact with.<a name=234:11></a> The first point is abiding in Him.<a name=234:12></a> "Without me ye can do nothing".<a name=234:13></a> The loss of or departure from this opens the door to every kind of mistake or officiousness.<a name=234:14></a> I dwell in love in Him in whom it was fully manifested.<a name=234:15></a> I know how I can count on Him in every instance, for His glory.<a name=234:16></a> My motive for the work is the love of God, and counting on Him I shrink not from the work because of the sense of incompetence, or the insufficiency of means.<a name=234:17></a> Where there is faith there is always means, and therefore faith never goes beyond means.<a name=234:18></a> If it be simply maintained that every good work must flow from abiding in Christ, then it is

		the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=243:1></a> One may argue very speciously on the subject, but this only proves how subtle and insinuating one's own feelings are, and how successfully Satan can ply his snare, because it is so difficult to see where it is; "in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird".<a name=243:2></a> When Christ is before my soul it is not my own feelings that occupy me, but Himself; not the product, but the Producer; and this is joy in God, making our boast in Him.<a name=243:3></a> The snare is not in the product itself, but in making the product the centre of satisfaction and the ground of complacency, as one would enjoy fruits and flowers in winter, when there was no producing power.<a name=243:4></a> It is evidently well and wise to have fruits and flowers, but if the producing power be extinct, the supply must cease, and the mind naturally is occupied with that which it has acquired, and not with the one who produced it; and alas!<a name=243:5></a> self is made too prominent, and there is self-exaltation from which an apostle would suffer, were it not for the thorn in the flesh.<a name=243:6></a> If there be conscience to watch against this most subtle snare, grace will be given to keep the Lord so before one, as the only object to boast in, that it will soon be detected if the summer has turned into winter.<a name=243:7></a>

		I have dwelt long on this first form of the snare because it is so specious, and it is only in the devoted it could occur, and therefore it is the most damaging because it overthrows or saps the strength of the mighty ones.<a name=243:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The second form of the snare is good conduct, not what one feels but what one does.<a name=243:9></a> It is plain enough if one can be deceived to dwell on his own devotion of heart to Christ, or his acquisitions from Him, he will soon become occupied with his conduct and works.<a name=243:10></a> No one could deny that a saint should be exemplary for conduct and good works; but when I begin to think of what I have done, or what I am doing, I make myself of importance; I am seeking reputation for myself.<a name=243:11></a>

		One great mark of every kind of decrepitude is the effort to exhibit life and property.<a name=244:1></a> The decay of states has been marked by great buildings; of individuals, by great external show.<a name=244:2></a> Where there is real possession there is no effort to exhibit it.<a name=244:3></a> It makes itself felt.<a name=244:4></a> It is necessary for a publican like Zacchaeus to proclaim his good deeds, because there is nothing in his position or calling in life to indicate any such goodness.<a name=244:5></a> Laodicea boasts of what she possesses.<a name=244:6></a> She has data for her assumption, and she has an audience which listens to her boastings.<a name=244:7></a> She has commended herself to man, and man can appreciate her good works, and admit her claims.<a name=244:8></a> Hence the character of the works must be human.<a name=244:9></a> A work like that of Mary, breaking the alabaster box and anointing the feet of Jesus, would not be understood at all.<a name=244:10></a> Undoubtedly a saint should be exemplary for good morals, and every good work, but he is required to go higher than a human level.<a name=244:11></a> If he makes what man can recognise and appreciate his standard, he is seeking a place of distinction for himself as a man, however he may disclaim it or be in theory above it.<a name=244:12></a> He must rise to Christ, and there he is on a level quite outside the comprehension of man; but the Lord will approve of him, though his most religious acquaintance may both misunderstand and denounce him.<a name=244:13></a> If I keep the high and only true level for a saint, I shall never overlook any work or conduct pleasing to Christ, but He will be my reference, and not the most religious among men, and certainly not the multitude.<a name=244:14></a> In fact, if I turn to man at all, I am taken in the snare.<a name=244:15></a>

		Lastly, the third form of the snare is when the heart looks for evidence of God's favour in the circle of things which suit and gratify man.<a name=244:16></a> Now as to this last, I do not say that God does not in a peculiar way manifest His love and His care for His people now; but if a saint makes what suits him as a man the circle in which he looks for God to demonstrate His favour, then he has not got above man and earth, and he has not found

		the circle in which Christ has set him, as "blessed .<a name=245:1></a>.<a name=245:2></a>.<a name=245:3></a> with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ".<a name=245:4></a> It is evident that if one looks for expression of divine favour in the sphere of man, however otherwise instructed he may be, his soul has not apprehended the highest sphere, or he would look there for manifestation of God's favour, especially as there it would be the greatest.<a name=245:5></a> The evidence of His love in the highest sphere must surpass anything in the lower one, and as the highest one is the one in which God has set us, it is a departure from our true position when we turn to look for His favours on earth.<a name=245:6></a> I do not for a moment say that they do not come, but I do say that if the highest sphere is the one wherein His love delights to express itself, a saint has fallen to the human side when he is watching for favours on earth, or drawing confirmation of His love from the greatness or extent of them.<a name=245:7></a> I am sure that the saint most conversant with the unfoldings of His love in the light of glory and the festivities of the Father's house, will best interpret in detail all the love with which he is cared for here.<a name=245:8></a> But it will often be quite beyond human comprehension, and can only be solved by one who has learnt the heart of God in His own sphere, where there is nothing to check its great and holy disclosures, As a rule, saints talk of their trials and of their mercies; they seldom rise from the level of man.<a name=245:9></a> They are in the snare, and the longer they are held in it, the more insensible they become to that which holds them.<a name=245:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		How different and unspeakably blessed it is, when one, resting in faith on Christ glorified, finds streams of living water flowing down from Him, and from which he can contribute to the earth, instead of, as of old in the feast of tabernacles, celebrating how God has made the earth to contribute to him.<a name=245:11></a> The Lord deliver His beloved people from the snare of Satan.<a name=245:12></a>

		The wider the range of any subject or duty, the more care must there be, if it is to be true to itself, that it lose not its character because of its diffusiveness, as a stream is lost in a lake.<a name=246:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It has been well said, the greater our privilege, the greater our responsibility.<a name=246:2></a> No greater privilege could be conferred on any one than to be appointed of the Lord an evangelist -- one to proclaim the good tidings which have been entrusted to him.<a name=246:3></a> He has received them from the Lord, and he proclaims them with gladness of heart.<a name=246:4></a> To announce good tidings is his duty; he is appointed to this service, and he accordingly pursues it; but I repeat, if the privilege is great, the responsibility is as great.<a name=246:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there are three things incumbent on the evangelist.<a name=246:6></a> First, he must deliver his message, communicate the gospel; and in order to do this rightly, he must know it.<a name=246:7></a> Secondly, he must look to the Lord for guidance as to the person to whom he shall announce his message; and thirdly, he must be led by the Spirit as to the manner and way in which the work is to be done.<a name=246:8></a> Imperfection in any of these will proportionately hinder and compromise the evangelist in his work.<a name=246:9></a> If the first be defective, the greatest possible damage will occur.<a name=246:10></a> The recipients of an imperfect gospel will exhibit sad marks of the imperfection; and the evangelist who has not delivered the gospel will not be led in triumph in Christ, making manifest the savour of His knowledge "in them that are saved, and in them that perish: to the one .<a name=246:11></a>.<a name=246:12></a>.<a name=246:13></a> the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life".<a name=246:14></a>

		And to the eunuch he began at the same scripture and evangelised Jesus.<a name=248:1></a> What tidings he must have told of the One whose "life is taken from the earth"!<a name=248:2></a> So also Paul with the Philippian jailor in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16">Acts  16</a>; he connects his soul at once with the Lord Jesus Christ -- "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved".<a name=248:3></a> There might be many exercises and variations before his soul was resting fully in Christ, but the magnet was set before his faith at the start, and from the first he knew the only place of solid rest for his soul.<a name=248:4></a> This point is plain enough, that in every case the gospel preached was such as to connect the soul with Christ personally, and not merely to give it release from judgment.<a name=248:5></a> There is nothing that ought to sadden the heart of the servant of Christ more than the converts of the present day, who, however true and sincere they may be, are like young trees in dense brush-wood, which, though there be existence and some growth, are yet of the most attenuated form.<a name=248:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second point of importance to the evangelist is the sphere of his service.<a name=248:7></a> Surely there must be some given sphere.<a name=248:8></a> A man would not get tidings without directions as to the person to whom he should communicate them.<a name=248:9></a> And if the evangelist be not constantly under the guidance of the Lord as to this, the very extent of his sphere, and the many needing salvation, will soon divert him from the Lord to the need around him, and the consequence will be that he will be occupied with man, and not with the Lord's mind.<a name=248:10></a> When the needy are in multitudes, one with heart and ability to provide for them may, if his eye rest on them, feel their claim on his service and time to be paramount.<a name=248:11></a> But if he realises that he is sent by the Lord to deliver a message, he will not be the less ready to meet the needy, but he will wait on the Lord as to where he ought to be and to whom to preach.<a name=248:12></a> "Preach the gospel to every creature", shows the universality of the message, but does not run counter to the individual commission

		of each one who bears it.<a name=249:1></a> Every true evangelist is specially sent, or he would not be a servant at all.<a name=249:2></a> We find on record several instances of this special sending.<a name=249:3></a> Philip is sent to the desert in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#8">Acts  8</a>.<a name=249:4></a> In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16">Acts  16</a>Paul is forbidden to preach the word in Asia; they assayed to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit suffered them not.<a name=249:5></a> In chapter 18 he is desired by the Lord to tarry at Corinth, for He had much people in the city.<a name=249:6></a> His reason for going into Macedonia was assuredly to preach the gospel there.<a name=249:7></a> In a word, the evangelist has a special sphere, and his work is appointed for him by his Lord and Master.<a name=249:8></a> If it were not so, it would deprive him of the dignity of a servant.<a name=249:9></a> And he needs the more to take heed to this because, unlike the teacher or the pastor, whose sphere of duty is so marked out that he cannot so easily diverge from it, that of the evangelist is wide and unlimited, and he is so little under the control even of his fellows, that he needs the greatest watchfulness, lest he take advantage of the licence which so extended a sphere might seem to accord to him.<a name=249:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the rule or practice in the present day is that almost every one with any measure of devotedness and zeal for service assumes to be an evangelist until he has formed a circle or congregation, when he drops into a teacher or pastor as well.<a name=249:11></a> I do not say that there are not many evangelists, but that the idea abroad is that you begin with evangelising, and that by and by you may be fitted to have the charge of a congregation.<a name=249:12></a> Neither do I deny that there may be two gifts in the same man; but I do not believe that an evangelist grows into a teacher, or that the former is merged in the latter.<a name=249:13></a> The gifts are specialities, and they remain.<a name=249:14></a> They may have lost their lustre, because not truly exercised and cultivated, but they remain.<a name=249:15></a> All I submit is, that there is no scriptural warrant for the indiscriminate attempt at evangelising which is now the rule; and that, not simply in the way that evangelising is spoken of in

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Lastly, the third point is the manner and mode in which the work should be done.<a name=250:2></a> Let us examine for a little the light which Scripture gives us on this point, for I fear we shall find very little similarity between the instances recorded in the New Testament and the greater part of the evangelising of the present day.<a name=250:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The mode is twofold, one public and the other private.<a name=250:4></a> The public is where opportunity favours, or where there is special invitation; the private, the more general and favoured mode for the evangelist.<a name=250:5></a> I do not find that the object of the first evangelists was ever publicity, or to collect large audiences.<a name=250:6></a> There is a great difference between universality and publicity.<a name=250:7></a> We find in the Acts that Paul went into the synagogues, and in Jerusalem the multitude came together; but they did not summon the multitude to wait on them to hear the gospel.<a name=250:8></a> The evangelist does not shrink from public testimony, as Paul at the Roman tribunal; but he does not make himself a public man, or collect around himself or his preaching.<a name=250:9></a> He goes after souls, and does not call them after him.<a name=250:10></a> The latter is the rule in christendom, and it is a fact worthy of note that the more ritualistic the clergyman, the less he visits individually, and the more he enjoins and requires attendance congregationally.<a name=250:11></a> But our inquiry is how Scripture treats the subject.<a name=250:12></a> Let us look at a few examples of the mode of preaching of the early evangelists.<a name=250:13></a> Paul, we have seen, sought the Jews in the synagogue, and preached Christ to them wherever it was tolerated; but the presentation of the gospel to the gentiles concerns us more.<a name=250:14></a> We have an example of it in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10">Acts  10</a>, where Cornelius calls together a company, and the evangelist, Peter, addresses those who are invited to hear him.<a name=250:15></a> In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13">Acts  13</a>, Paul having

		preached in the synagogue, the gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath; and accordingly almost the whole city came together to hear the word of God.<a name=251:1></a> Again at Athens, in chapter 17, he spake in the market daily with them that met with him, and preached unto them Jesus and the resurrection.<a name=251:2></a> In chapter 16 we find that there was a special call to Macedonia, and Paul and Silas went there, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called them to preach the gospel there.<a name=251:3></a> And when they came to Philippi, the chief city, they did not summon the multitude to hear them, but abode there certain days, and "on the sabbath .<a name=251:4></a>.<a name=251:5></a>.<a name=251:6></a> went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and .<a name=251:7></a>.<a name=251:8></a>.<a name=251:9></a> spake unto the women which resorted thither".<a name=251:10></a> And a certain woman heard them, whose heart the Lord opened; and "she was baptised, and her household".<a name=251:11></a> This was the beginning of the work at Philippi, a small and unobtrusive beginning to bring about such great results.<a name=251:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In private, or individually, I see the evangelist in his highest place; and here it is that he best displays his qualifications and abilities.<a name=251:13></a> He feels he is sent to preach the gospel universally; he is not told the actual man that will be saved, or the actual number; but he sets himself to work, as is figuratively set forth in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15">Luke  15</a>.<a name=251:14></a> Led of the Spirit of God, he sweeps the house and seeks diligently till he find the silver piece.<a name=251:15></a> His heart is set on saving some; but as Christ's servant he is led in triumph, and is thus a savour of life unto life, and of death unto death.<a name=251:16></a> Like Philip he may be sent hundreds of miles off for the soul of an Ethiopian; or like Paul at Corinth, he may have to stay three years in one city before the silver pieces are rescued; or as at Philippi, he may suffer grievously unto death before he is within reach of the soul for which he has been sent.<a name=251:17></a> The evangelist has one great thought before him, how he may testify of God's grace to souls and win them to Christ.<a name=251:18></a> His message is, 'Come to the supper' -- and

		Secondly, it is evident that an evangelist must be free from any occupation which would interfere with his being sent to any part of the earth.<a name=256:2></a> A preacher can be faithful in his own locality, and remain in it as Noah did, who was a preacher, not an evangelist.<a name=256:3></a> The evangelist seeks the soul, and is the messenger from God to it of the light of the glory of Christ, who has finished everything according to the mind of God.<a name=256:4></a> He communicates the wonderful tidings entrusted to him.<a name=256:5></a> When it is received, his heart rejoices; and when it is refused he retires to find his test in Him whose servant he is.<a name=256:6></a>

		I should add that because the church has become like a "great house", congregations of professing christians are now found everywhere who really do not know the gospel, though bearing the name of christians; and to such the pastor Timothy has to make full proof of his ministry, and therefore to "do the work of an evangelist".<a name=256:7></a> In this light a resident pastor is a preacher and an active evangelist, as every true saint is in some degree.<a name=256:8></a>

		To any one interested in the state of the saints in general, nothing will possibly strike him more forcibly, and, according as he has heart for Christ, more painfully, than the contentedness and ease in which the saints are, while they have so little communion with the mind of God.<a name=257:1></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		All through Scripture there is a marked contrast between the saint who is eager and intent on knowing the mind of the Lord, and the one who is satisfied with the measure of light and truth which suits himself.<a name=257:2></a> We see in the Old Testament times, before the word of God was completed, that light was communicated as there was dependence on God, and when the dependence declined there was no more communication; so that dependence on God precedes the communication or the knowledge of His mind, and prepares for it.<a name=257:3></a>

		The great result to be attained by all the exercises of the wilderness is that man should "not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth man live", that is, he should be entirely dependent on God and His word; and hence our blessed Lord utters this sentence when He enters on His path of service here.<a name=257:4></a> He begins His course where at best we only end it.<a name=257:5></a> He was fully and entirely the dependent One, and hence He was always heard, and He did always the things which pleased the Father.<a name=257:6></a> His communion was unbroken.<a name=257:7></a> To live in unbroken communion, you must continue in absolute dependence.<a name=257:8></a> It is not merely dependence on God for some particular necessity, but a dependence that can waive the righteous claims of nature because so entirely dependent on His word and will.<a name=257:9></a> And it is to the one thus absolutely dependent that He reveals and confides His mind.<a name=257:10></a> He could not, as it were, commit it to any one else.<a name=257:11></a> If I am not absolutely dependent on Him, I am dependent

		of the Lord's mind as to things at the time was this absolute dependence.<a name=259:1></a> When Abram's father was dead, when he was simply dependent, not knowing whither he went, he was led of God into the land of Canaan, the place that was in accordance with the mind of God.<a name=259:2></a> It is said, "Get thee out of thy country .<a name=259:3></a>.<a name=259:4></a>.<a name=259:5></a> unto a land that I will shew thee".<a name=259:6></a> The reason why any saint nowadays does not enter into the mind of God as to the place where God would have him be is simply this, that he is not dependent enough to be led of God and to be instructed in the good pleasure of His will respecting him.<a name=259:7></a> Abram had heard the word of God and had in part attended to it; but not until his father was dead was he so at God's disposal, because of dependence on Him, that He could lead him as He wished.<a name=259:8></a> Again, when Abram risks all that he had, his own life and the lives of his servants, to rescue Lot -- when he is thus absolutely cast on God -- Melchisedec meets him as he returns from the slaughter of the kings; Christ's position as priest and king is typically presented to him, and he is blessed by him.<a name=259:9></a> All the trouble and suffering had been occasioned by and endured for Lot.<a name=259:10></a> As to favours on earth Lot commands all attention; yet it is not to him, but to the dependent and suffering one, that the mind of the Lord as touching the kingdom of the Son of God is revealed.<a name=259:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, when Abraham offers up Isaac, when he consents at the command of God to strip himself of that which his heart rested on here, when he depends on God alone who raiseth the dead, then, consequent on this exercise of dependence, he receives from God the fullest blessing connected with his own seed on earth.<a name=259:12></a> In the former instance, when he risks everything to rescue Lot, when he is fighting God's battles, he is met and blessed by Melchisedec; Christ's royal position is made known to him.<a name=259:13></a> But now, when it is more peculiarly his own interests, the greatest and fullest blessing of his own people is revealed to him.<a name=259:14></a>

		THE TWO PROCESSES -- LIFE AND DEATH

	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing is to learn from the word of God the standard for a saint.<a name=262:7></a> The standard for man was the law; the standard for a christian is Christ.<a name=262:8></a> Now as soon as the standard is accepted, then the two processes must begin.<a name=262:9></a> One is to grow in likeness to Christ in the new nature, and the other to cast out and mortify the flesh, the old man.<a name=262:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The thing to understand is that, being born again, I am now to be conformed to the image of Christ.<a name=262:11></a> As He is my life, all growth in the new man must be derived from Him by the Spirit of God.<a name=262:12></a> There can be no advance but as the eye is on Him.<a name=262:13></a> Beholding the glory of the Lord we are changed.<a name=262:14></a> It simplifies the matter wonderfully to the soul when you see and are assured that all must come from Christ, and that He is the standard, so that if I say I abide in Him, I must walk even as He walked.<a name=262:15></a> This is the first point, that I can do nothing without or apart from Him; that there can be no supply from Him to me but as I realise my link to Him.<a name=262:16></a> If I have a lower standard than Christ, I necessarily adopt other means for attaining it.<a name=262:17></a> If I

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this is the second process.<a name=263:3></a> The growth of the new does not improve the old; on the contrary, it only exposes the incongruity of the two.<a name=263:4></a> Ishmael was fourteen years in Abraham's house before he was cast out, and he was not provoked to mock or persecute until Isaac had acquired his true place there.<a name=263:5></a> And just so is the growth of Christ in the soul which alone gives one a truer and deeper sense of the hostility of the flesh.<a name=263:6></a> This is not correcting the flesh.<a name=263:7></a> The presence of the greater good only exasperates the greater evil.<a name=263:8></a> It does not temper or alleviate it, as heat would cold; but, on the contrary, the contrast or collision elicits antagonism.<a name=263:9></a> "The flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh".<a name=263:10></a> It is not as with an alkali and an acid, which, neutralising one another, form a new component.<a name=263:11></a> This is the Wesleyan notion.<a name=263:12></a> But the hostility of the evil, the flesh, intensifies according as the good, or Christ, increases in the soul.<a name=263:13></a> The growl of the lion is only more and more savage as the avenger approaches him.<a name=263:14></a> There is therefore no remedy, no treatment for the flesh, but complete and absolute denial or death.<a name=263:15></a>

		The mistake with many is that they begin with the attempt to correct their characters or nature.<a name=263:16></a> Every one admits the necessity of self-culture when the standard is not simply Christ.<a name=263:17></a> And hence, after much self-control and education, they do not make any true progress.<a name=263:18></a> They may be able to attain an appearance among men, as the Pharisees had done, but there is

		Now when the truth has been received that there is nothing good in the flesh, and that it is not susceptible of improvement, a new danger arises which I would particularly refer to.<a name=264:9></a> It is this: that as there is no good but in Christ, and He is the only source of it, if He be accepted in this light, all is thought to be right, and then the flesh is in a way overlooked or left to itself.<a name=264:10></a> Isaac is indeed chief in the house, but Ishmael is allowed to stay too; he is not felt to be intolerable and incongruous.<a name=264:11></a> Or, in plain language, with the acceptance of high truth, self-denial is often less than before.<a name=264:12></a> Now this is very sad, and tends always to decline and loss of enjoyment in the truth.<a name=264:13></a> When Christ has His true and rightful place in me, the opposition of the flesh is so felt that the only treatment for it is casting it out -- mortification.<a name=264:14></a> "They that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts".<a name=264:15></a> And hence, the more I am in the power of His life, the more do I deny myself in order that His life may be manifested in my body.<a name=264:16></a> Every impediment to this is to be removed.<a name=264:17></a>

		As to standing before God, I start with being crucified with Christ; and hence in the greatest practice I can only reach up to my true place in Christ, and my practice is only true as I act up to my standing in Christ where I am crucified, "Nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me".<a name=265:2></a> Hence, according as Christ lives in me, and uses my body according to His own will and for His service, there must be a constant practical denial of the desires of the flesh with its ways and habits.<a name=265:3></a> So in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2">Colossians  2</a>I find that, because I am complete in Him, I am both circumcised, the body of the flesh is put off, and also my status as a man is gone in baptism.<a name=265:4></a> If a person assumes to be occupied with Christ and delighting in His mind and ways, and yet does not manifest in his body the life of Jesus, where is there any evidence of the power of His life?<a name=265:5></a> If I excuse myself by saying I am used to such a thing, and therefore I must retain it, I thereby assert that the natural propensity in me is stronger than the life of Jesus.<a name=265:6></a> However completely the life is manifested, it must be through the bearing about of the dying of Jesus.<a name=265:7></a> How could it appear if that which balks it were not removed?<a name=265:8></a> And it must be removed prior to the manifestation.<a name=265:9></a> That is, I have to keep under my body and bring it into subjection.<a name=265:10></a> I have to judge myself.<a name=265:11></a> I have to refuse morally the working of the will, that I may be a vessel for the Lord, doing His will, and though it be death to the outer man, yet assuring my heart of the eternal weight of glory before me.<a name=265:12></a> It is not only that I am like Enoch, well-pleasing to Him, but He shows His delight in me by manifesting Himself.<a name=265:13></a>

		There are two ways in which this subject is looked at in Scripture.<a name=292:7></a> First, when the temporal property is looked at as a gift, that is, that it is given of God in order that the holder of it may dispense it.<a name=292:8></a> In this case the possessor is called rich; and the word is, "Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy; that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate; laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life" or "what is really life", <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#6:17">1 Timothy  6:17</a> - 19.<a name=292:9></a> Here the riches, if properly expended, not only serve because of the good works in the present, but they are an investment for the future; and the expender is not only laying up in store a good foundation in the good works which he performs, but in parting with the present he is laying hold on that which is really life.<a name=292:10></a> This is the right reading of this passage, and it explains another passage.<a name=292:11></a> "Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness".<a name=292:12></a> All temporal property is the Lord's; and when any falls to the lot of a saint now, he is not debarred from possessing it, because it is not really his.<a name=292:13></a> The "mammon of unrighteousness" means riches

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in keeping with this, Peter calls riches a gift.<a name=293:6></a> "As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good [economists or] stewards of the manifold grace of God", <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#4:10">1 Peter  4:10</a>.<a name=293:7></a> The point is simply that the property is not for one's own consequence or enjoyment, but for faithful expenditure, resulting in a true and good investment for the donor.<a name=293:8></a> The possessors of temporal property would, if they understood these scriptures, receive quite a new idea about their duties.<a name=293:9></a> Instead of the riches being a ground of distinction here on earth, or to be expended in ministering to my own gratification, I am to expend them as a good economist of the manifold grace of God; and my investments for the future are in proportion to my godly gifts in the present.<a name=293:10></a> Thus it is the reverse with the world and with the saints.<a name=293:11></a> With the world it is, if you keep now, you will have by and by; while the saint, if he spends wisely now, lays up for time to come.<a name=293:12></a>

		In conclusion, two things are evident; one, that we cannot see a truth in Scripture rightly but as we see it in God's light; and the other, that we must be in a state ourselves to receive it practically.<a name=324:7></a> The latter is the preparation for receiving it, and hence, though one may sometimes hear a truth before he needs it, or possesses it practically, yet, if he is really to receive it, he will surely be placed in circumstances where he can truly understand it; for he cannot rightly or with power speak of it till then, for it is not rightly his until it has controlled him, and he cannot press it controllingly on others until he has been controlled by it himself.<a name=324:8></a>

		In a world of evil, man, when naturally susceptible to it, is continually under it, and therefore anyone who would help him can only do so by delivering him from its pressure.<a name=324:9></a> Now we find that there is a certain sense of need and a desire for deliverance in many before it

	<div class="paragraph">
		Yet a labourer, though really gifted of God with the truth in his heart, is ensnared and diverted from the path of Christ when, regarding the state of the people, he allows himself to act with respect to it merely, and not simply according to the word of the Lord.<a name=326:3></a> Thus it was with King Saul when he offered the burnt offering because he saw that the people were scattered from him; <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#13:12">1 Samuel  13:12</a>, 13.<a name=326:4></a>

		A leader among men does not originate the state of things in which he is foremost, he merely gives it a head in himself.<a name=326:5></a> It is not possible for man to introduce anything entirely new; he may discover things hitherto unknown, and he may introduce new combinations of known things; it is only the Spirit of the Lord that can set forth or propound what is entirely new and divinely appropriate in any given crisis.<a name=326:6></a> This is really Christ's path, the path of wisdom -- an invisible one; and if the servant he not kept in this path, he descends to the human one, which man commends; and as he is useful therein, he makes a mark on society in improving it, and obtains a name among men; he is a hero or benefactor.<a name=326:7></a> First it is admitted that the Lord gives the word, and that great is the company of those who publish it.<a name=326:8></a> So far there are many true labourers; but then comes the necessity for caution and waiting on the Lord, lest, though a true labourer in heart, one should be turned to man for the line of action, and not to the Lord simply; that is, man's prudence dictates and defines the manner of serving, and not the Holy Spirit, who is the source of the service itself.<a name=326:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the first mark that it is the object of my service which forms my line of action, is that I trust to or use human means to effect or accomplish the service.<a name=326:10></a> Unless a labourer walks in faith, has an invisible path, and can introduce something entirely new, he must resort to

		what is at hand, and, like a hero, he gives force and prominence to feelings or wants which he has himself, so that others can co-operate with him.<a name=327:1></a> A labourer, with the purest intention, given of God, may resort to human means to accomplish it, for he knows no better; but then it is man that is before his mind and not simply the Lord.<a name=327:2></a> His thought is from man upward, instead of from the Lord coming down to man; and this was the case with Moses when he first attempted to deliver Israel.<a name=327:3></a> He had a true purpose of heart to deliver the people of Israel from the thraldom of Egypt; but not knowing the Lord's mind, and having the people pre-eminently before his mind, he resorts to the only means at his command, and, hero-like, with his own hand slays the Egyptian.<a name=327:4></a> Forty years afterwards when Moses had learned that the Lord is the source of true service, he entered on the purpose of his heart in quite a different way, one entirely new and incomprehensible to man -- one of faith, and thus distinctly of God.<a name=327:5></a> In the times of the judges, many human expedients were resorted to in order to effect deliverance, and the Lord favoured each with success, and men were greatly signalised.<a name=327:6></a> But when Samuel -- the answer to the cry of faith -- serves, it is by turning to the Lord in prayer.<a name=327:7></a> Then a new mode of action with a new form of power is introduced; God and His way of working command one's whole attention: "The Lord thundered .<a name=327:8></a>.<a name=327:9></a>.<a name=327:10></a> on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them", <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#7:10">1 Samuel  7:10</a>.<a name=327:11></a> The nearer we are to God, the more our work is in divine power, and the less it is in human effort.<a name=327:12></a> If one has the heart and purpose to serve, it is plain enough that if he does not know the divine way, he must resort to the human way, and it is not his purpose or his ability which I impugn, but the line of action in which he seeks to effect his true and good intention.<a name=327:13></a> When such a one turns to human means in any measure, he drinks of the old wine, and spoils his taste for the new; he has stooped

	<div class="paragraph">
		to human effort, natural energy, and is unable to understand or see the invisible path of the Spirit of God.<a name=328:1></a> And hence the labourer, using human means in any way, persuasive words, sensational appeals, or thrilling anecdotes, either does not know the Lord's mode of action, or, having drunk of the old wine, he does not straightway desire the new, "for he saith, The old is better".<a name=328:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second mark that the labourer has man pre-eminently before him for his service is that he is occupied with results.<a name=328:3></a> It is his success which cheers and approves him, and not the simple fact that he has done the work and will of the Lord, and has His approval irrespective of result.<a name=328:4></a> He rejoices when, like the disciples of old, he can say, The devils are subject to us through thy word; he knows nothing of the patient toil of the one who can say, "I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for nought".<a name=328:5></a> He is like an Elijah in one day, a John the baptist in another; well nigh confounded when success or open acknowledgment does not accompany his labours.<a name=328:6></a> He knows nothing of the service of Paul at Philippi; baffled, hindered, and suffering every way, and yet when, as it were, all hope is gone of service in that place, when he is a prisoner and human energies are at an end, the jailer, broken down by the power of God, falls down before him, crying, "What must I do to be saved?<a name=328:7></a>" The brightest time in a servant's career is when, to human eyes, he has no results to show, even as it was with Paul in prison in Rome, or with John in Patmos, for the word of the Lord and the testimony of Jesus Christ.<a name=328:8></a> It is only the thoroughly dependent servant that can be entrusted with the arduous service of maintaining for God single-handed against all comers; like Isaiah, who, having found a holy rest in the glory of God, is prepared to descend to the worst state of things in Israel; or like Daniel in Babylon, or Paul before the Roman tribunal.<a name=328:9></a> There are Jonahs nowadays pining because their service is

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The third mark is that labourers who do not rise above man as the object of their service never lead souls beyond the benefit of salvation.<a name=329:2></a> They are occupied with the need of souls, which is right in itself, but there is a great difference in whether my service is measured or defined by the need of souls, or by the purpose of God in His love.<a name=329:3></a> True, if I could not feel for man as man feels it, I could not meet his need; but on the other hand, if I do not see God's purpose in grace, I cannot present the remedy according to the divine measure; I must present the gospel only to meet man's need; I cannot lead the heart of the needy one into the fulness of God's grace, for this I do not see or apprehend for myself.<a name=329:4></a> Consequently the fruits of such labour, the converts, though they be true and happy in the assurance of salvation, are not devoted in self-surrender or world surrender, simply because it is not Christ personally who is the joy and object of their hearts, but their own forgiveness.<a name=329:5></a> Whereas if the gospel were presented as it is in God's heart and purpose, to meet the need of a lost prodigal, it would lead him, not only from the far country to taste of his father's forgiving love, but to enter on a new and unknown sphere of eternal blessedness within the sacred precincts of His presence; and this can be done by no impressiveness of human effort, but by the Holy Spirit's power alone.<a name=329:6></a> The gospel which conducts the soul into the greatest height is the gospel which must have reached the sinner's greatest depth.<a name=329:7></a> For nowhere else is seen as in the height of glory, how every speck of sin and every taint of unholiness is swept away in the cross.<a name=329:8></a> There is an end there to human things, to man himself, and the new divine path of life is opened out to the soul; and in this the servant of Christ treads, and to this he leads the soul he serves; and a soul once upon it cannot depart from it or bring in the smallest part of

	<div class="paragraph">
		The fourth mark is that the labourer who employs the human element is always attractive to men.<a name=330:2></a> Man is his object, and he becomes a hero to men.<a name=330:3></a> I do not say that at no time are great numbers led together to hear the word of God, but, as at Antioch, it will soon arouse opposition and persecution; <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13:50">Acts  13:50</a>.<a name=330:4></a> I merely present the fact that the more popularly the gospel is presented, the larger the attendance and the natural assent to it.<a name=330:5></a> A man of eloquence or a man of position preaching the gospel will command a congregation, which a man walking in simple dependence, with neither of those adjuncts, seldom will.<a name=330:6></a> The human element suits the human mind, and really there are but the two ways -- man's or God's.<a name=330:7></a> Now though God uses the human vessel, body and mind, to convey His mind to man, yet it is always by His Spirit; while even a truly gifted labourer who uses human means to influence man can necessarily never go beyond man, for man cannot advance a man beyond a man.<a name=330:8></a> What is of the flesh is flesh: what is of the Spirit is spirit.<a name=330:9></a> No one ever served man as the blessed Lord, and no one was ever left so alone and so unacknowledged here.<a name=330:10></a> Where the apostle laboured most, there all were turned away from him (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1:15">2 Timothy  1:15</a>).<a name=330:11></a> The master-builder of the church was reduced in his own person to the experience of a solitary man in chains.<a name=330:12></a>

		Every truth has its own peculiar effect, one which no other truth could produce, any more than one kind of tree could produce the fruit of another.<a name=331:1></a> In practice the lack of any truth can be discovered, and even where it has been learned, the measure of its acceptance is tested and disclosed by the way in which it is practised.<a name=331:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The glory of Christ is an admitted truth with every believer, but if we really knew Him in glory, it would impart to us its own mark.<a name=331:3></a> We are conversant with man in death and sin and distance from God, for that is our own state by nature; but to know a Man in glory, One in acceptance with God according to all His moral greatness, is new to us and magnificent; and according as we know Him there we become not only superior to, or distanced from, our own state as men, but morally suited to the glory with which we are associated.<a name=331:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is plain that the Son of God came to earth, born of a woman, born under the law, and lived here a life of perfect obedience, in every detail well-pleasing to God, fully setting forth in His own walk what man should be before God, from His birth to the holy mount, and until He descended to death to bear in Himself the judgment which lay on man, because he had sinned and was not what he ought to be.<a name=331:5></a> Thus He suffered, "the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God"; and under the weight of everything which was upon us and against us, He glorified God.<a name=331:6></a> The Son of man was glorified at the very moment when our Substitute; the moment of His greatest agony only disclosed the entire and perfect subjection of His heart to God, so that then the Son of man was glorified; God was glorified in Him, and God straightway glorified Him.<a name=331:7></a> He claims glory on the ground that He had

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now if I do not see that Christ has glorified God under the judgment due to me, I cannot look after Him into the glory of God.<a name=332:3></a> I must first see that He encountered all on my side, as we see in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>, where every obstacle, every form of it, from sin to personal weakness, is encountered by Him; and subsequent to that, or rather following on that, He declares the Father, as He says, "I will declare thy name unto my brethren", verse 22.<a name=332:4></a> If He has in His own Person perfectly removed all that man was exposed to, and is now declaring the Father, then, as I know Him in the latter, I not only know Him as my Saviour and Deliverer from all my sin and ruin, but I know Him in new and divine associations, even in relationship with His God and Father, and on the same ground as Himself; as He says to Mary Magdalene, "I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God".<a name=332:5></a> Hence the effect of knowing Christ in glory is the consciousness, not only of full deliverance from every shade of evil, but of an introduction into a new scene altogether, in company with Him who, having saved me from my own sad order of things, has not stopped there, but has conducted me into His own.<a name=332:6></a> Saul of Tarsus passes from being the chief of sinners to the knowledge of a Saviour in the glory of God, who ignores everything of man and presents Himself as the only One to engage his heart.<a name=332:7></a> He had through His death on the cross placed Saul's sins in the land of forgetfulness, and now He can present Himself to the chief of sinners as his Saviour in full acceptance in the glory of God.<a name=332:8></a>

		GLORIFY GOD IN YOUR BODY
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From the beginning of man's history on earth, the body was the principal thing as to his relation with this scene.<a name=336:13></a> In the garden of Eden, while there was innocence, it was undying and uncovered; when sin entered, then
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		came death on the body; the body thus doomed God clothed with skins, and man was driven out of the garden.<a name=337:1></a> Now as there was faith, as divine power worked in anyone, there was an action of the body expressive of faith.<a name=337:2></a> "By faith Abel offered", etc.<a name=337:3></a> He did a certain act; his body was the agent by which he expressed the power which governed him.<a name=337:4></a> Where there was not faith there was no new power.<a name=337:5></a> Man used his body as the medium for gratifying his own desires and tastes.<a name=337:6></a> Where there was faith there were works, deeds done in the body; otherwise faith would be dead, as the apostle James shows.<a name=337:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is evident that faith produced works.<a name=337:8></a> It compelled the body to act in keeping with its view or sentiment; and hence the work was only an expression or counterpart in act of the power or idea which produced it.<a name=337:9></a> Every faith had its own work.<a name=337:10></a> But it was the subjection and submission of the body to this power which was the work, and the body was thus the display and the evidence of the faith, as James says, "Shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works".<a name=337:11></a> The faith was proved by the work which it produced, and thus Abraham was justified when he offered up his son, though forty years before he had the faith for which he was accounted righteous (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#15">Genesis  15</a>) and on which Paul insists in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#4">Romans  4</a>.<a name=337:12></a> The body was safe in innocence; but when sin entered, it was not only subject to death, but led away by divers lusts and passions, except where faith worked; and then, according as the faith ruled, the body became the evidence of it, and this proved its power; otherwise faith was dead.<a name=337:13></a> Hence, though the body was, after the fall, the theatre of all the desires of the flesh and of the mind, yet when there was faith, there was palpable proof that the body was under a greater power than the will of the flesh, and that very thing on which sin had entailed death was made to express the efficacy of divine control.<a name=337:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In innocence the body was according to God's will, but after the fall the will of man became the rule, and it was only as there was faith that the body in which sin dwelt, and which was under the penalty of death, became the expression or exponent of divine power working in it according to the requirement of faith.<a name=338:1></a> Thus the body was, like one on horseback, borne along by a power outside itself to a given point; but when again on foot -- when the power ceased to act -- occupying itself with its own pleasure.<a name=338:2></a> A certain thing had been done, a great deed performed which proved the mettle of the power which carried it, but the body generally remained unaltered in all its tastes and habits; for the Spirit did not yet dwell in it to control or order it in everything; the body was not then the temple of the Holy Spirit.<a name=338:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now under the law there was action required also.<a name=338:4></a> The body was required to express the demands of the law, but as there was no new power conferred, the demand only disclosed that there was no power in a body of sin to meet God's law.<a name=338:5></a> The law was added because of transgression to expose how entirely incompetent man was to meet what was righteously required.<a name=338:6></a> It was as if one were to sow garden seed in the wild sand in order to show that it could not grow there.<a name=338:7></a> The law was holy, just and good; but there was no power in man to personify the requirements of it.<a name=338:8></a> It was not sufficient to accept the terms of it, and to admit they were all right.<a name=338:9></a> Man under the law was called to express in his walk and ways the demands of it.<a name=338:10></a> It conferred nothing on him.<a name=338:11></a> It only required of him, and thus disclosed the weakness that was in him, as if one were required to walk a mile when not able to move one step.<a name=338:12></a>

		THE TRUTH REVIVED IN LATE YEARS, AND THE OPPOSITION TO IT
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The doctrine of justification by faith was revived to the church in Luther's day, and in late years two great truths have also been revived; one, that the Holy Spirit dwells on earth; the other, that the saints are the body of Christ here, baptised by one Spirit into one body, of which He is the Head in heaven.<a name=341:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=342>[Page 342]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As each of these truths has been maintained, a direct opposition has been raised against it.<a name=342:1></a> The violence and malice of Rome was, and is, arrayed against the first, whilst against the other two there are special adversaries which are only unmasked in proportion as there is persistent faithfulness to the truth.<a name=342:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing for the saint to accept is, that distinct and important truths have been revived.<a name=342:3></a> No saint nowadays will deny that justification by faith is an all-important truth, though many in Luther's day, and even subsequently, have conscientiously opposed it.<a name=342:4></a> Many saints in the present day do not see the immense importance of the truth of the presence of the Holy Spirit on earth, and that the body of Christ is here, formed by the baptism of the Holy Spirit; and inasmuch as they do not receive these truths, they do not enjoy the grace conferred by them, nor are they competent to be witnesses of Christ on earth.<a name=342:5></a> Without the doctrine of justification by faith, there could be no assurance to the soul of escape from divine judgment.<a name=342:6></a> No one could have a sense of pardon without accepting it.<a name=342:7></a> But many who have a sense of pardon have no guarantee or seal of the divine work in their souls.<a name=342:8></a> They do not believe that the Spirit of God dwells in them, or that the Holy Spirit forms the saints into one body, or that He dwells here to testify for Christ; so that they cannot, though assured of safety because of justification by faith, be happy individually, nor can they understand their privileges and responsibilities corporately, nor the nature or manner of testimony for Christ here.<a name=342:9></a> Thus there must be ignorance on these most important subjects, unless the truths brought out in these late years be accepted and maintained.<a name=342:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now these truths are united and yet quite distinct.<a name=342:11></a> We see in John's gospel that the Comforter would be sent by the Father for the comfort of the individual saint (<a href="../bible/John.htm#14:26">John  14:26</a>), while for testimony it is the Lord who sends Him.<a name=342:12></a> "The Comforter .<a name=342:13></a>.<a name=342:14></a>.<a name=342:15></a> whom I will

		send unto you from the Father, .<a name=343:1></a>.<a name=343:2></a>.<a name=343:3></a> he shall testify of me", chapter 15: 26.<a name=343:4></a> Paul alone speaks of the body: "By one Spirit are we all baptised into one body".<a name=343:5></a> Now these truths are in advance of the doctrine of justification by faith without works; no exercised heart can deny that they offer and propose a progress far beyond that of justification by faith.<a name=343:6></a> A sinner is lost unless he be justified; this is the beginning; but what advance can there be if there be no unqualified known certainty of it by the indwelling Spirit, and if there be no apprehension of our corporate privileges, nor of the testimony for Christ here?<a name=343:7></a> Yet these truths which confer so much are as little known in this day as was justification by faith in a former day, and the ignorance and opposition of heart to them are as great; otherwise, why are saints not ready and eager to receive them?<a name=343:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now let us see what these truths involve.<a name=343:9></a> First, individually there is no seal nor earnest of the inheritance unless the Holy Spirit dwells in the saint, When the saint knows himself to be the temple of the Holy Spirit, he is assured both of a present salvation and of a future inheritance.<a name=343:10></a> Surely very few believe this, and fewer still enjoy it; but that this truth, the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, should have been brought to light in this day, is a momentous fact, and involves great responsibility to all who hear of it.<a name=343:11></a> For if the doctrine of justification was great, this must be still greater, inasmuch as it confirms and establishes, perfectly and eternally, what the former commenced.<a name=343:12></a> The knowledge of forgiveness of sins does not preserve from the flesh.<a name=343:13></a> It is only as we walk in the Spirit that we shall not fulfil the lusts of the flesh.<a name=343:14></a> It is Christ living in us and setting us free from everything of the old man.<a name=343:15></a> Many a one who fully believes in justification by faith finds, to the pain and sorrow of his conscience, that he has no control over the flesh, and that he is continually led by it; and this is because he does not

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		believe that the Holy Spirit is the One who would now dwell in his body, to rule and order it for Christ.<a name=344:1></a> If one did not know how the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, one would be surprised at the hesitation of any saint to bow to this truth, or to raise any question as to it.<a name=344:2></a> But surely many a pious one in an earlier day raised questions as to the genuineness of justification by faith, and we ought not to be surprised at finding still greater and more subtle opposition to this.<a name=344:3></a> Alas!<a name=344:4></a> the flesh is the great opposer to this truth.<a name=344:5></a> All that the flesh likes is opposed to it.<a name=344:6></a> There is a personal opposition to it, because it sets aside man in his own will completely; and therefore, though the deliverance be desired by the conscience, there is an unwillingness to give up oneself, and to acknowledge the Holy Spirit as the guest who is to rule and order instead.<a name=344:7></a> Besides, unless a saint is in himself a temple of the Holy Spirit, unless he has drunk of the self-same Spirit, he cannot see how we are all baptised by one Spirit into one body.<a name=344:8></a> But when he enjoys the privileges which are his through the indwelling Spirit, he enters also into the responsibilities of the great calling of the church as committed to the apostle Paul, and taught in the epistle to the Ephesians.<a name=344:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If saints are the members of the body of Christ, formed into one body by the Spirit of God, they are bound to preserve this unity in the bond of peace.<a name=344:10></a> They have to refuse everything which would grieve or hinder the Spirit.<a name=344:11></a> I cannot confine myself to my own conscience, or to the consciences of those immediately in fellowship with me.<a name=344:12></a> Whatever is necessarily incumbent on me, as of the one body, is equally necessary and incumbent on any other member of it as a member.<a name=344:13></a> I am not speaking of matters of mere conscience; but whatever would defile me as a member of Christ's body, I must regard as defiling to any other member; otherwise I do not understand the unity of the body, and that it is formed by the Spirit of God.<a name=344:14></a> If I understand

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=345>[Page 345]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that I am a member of the body of Christ on earth, I feel that I have a claim on every saint on the earth, and every one of them has a claim on me; and we are bound, in a common responsibility, to meet together and to avow ourselves as of this oneness -- "one loaf" -- at the Lord's table, thus expressing our unity.<a name=345:1></a> Hence the table must be one, however extended; it is only one, as the Holy Spirit is one, and any one member received or excluded at one place must be received or excluded at every place.<a name=345:2></a> If there be but one table -- and there is but one -- anything done or maintained by any one, which disqualifies him from the table, is binding on every one forming the table.<a name=345:3></a> The length of the table does not make that right or allowable at one end, which is wrong, contrary to the Lord, at the other.<a name=345:4></a> The whole is answerable for a part, for it is an expression of the body.<a name=345:5></a> It must be so, otherwise there would be a denial of the unity of the Spirit.<a name=345:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the maintenance of this truth would impose on us an order of union and service to one another unknown and unpractised in the church generally, and would expose every one maintaining it to painful separation from, and exclusiveness with regard to, every saint refusing to bow to the great responsibility belonging to this high position; for a member who will not be a true member is like a dislocated one, causing suffering rather than being of use.<a name=345:7></a> There is no truth that the art and malice of Satan so assails as the truth of the mystery of Christ.<a name=345:8></a> It connects the saints so distinctly with Christ in heaven, and with one another by the Spirit of God, that one who realises it is superior to everything of man, although a man himself, and living among men; and hence there is no truth so little known or enjoyed, nor any which so many have in a sense received, but have afterwards surrendered as untenable.<a name=345:9></a> There is no truth so difficult to hold in any measure along with what is ordinarily received.<a name=345:10></a> Let any one ask himself how much he enters into being united to
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ as Head, and to the saints in one body here on earth, by the Holy Spirit, and he will see, if he judges truly, that he knows little of this wondrous truth.<a name=346:1></a> And it is because it is the greatest and the most blessed truth that Satan, the spirit of evil, is more opposed to it than to any other; and this accounts for the laxity, so deadly and terrible in its character, which has sprung up, and will ever spring up fiercely, as the truth is maintained fully, in order to neutralise it.<a name=346:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the great opposition to this truth does not come from the saints who are utterly ignorant of it, but from those who in word avow that they hold it.<a name=346:3></a> New as it is, and long as it was lost to the church, they profess to be enlightened in it, and assume that they are all but martyrs for this truth of the unity of the saints; and yet, from not understanding the nature and the susceptibilities of this divine union and what it claims, they really undermine the truth by their hollow and partial imitation of it.<a name=346:4></a> The greatest wile or by-path is that which comes nearest the true thing, and the curious strategic way in which they defend and propagate their laxity, while avowing this truth in word, is astounding.<a name=346:5></a> Brotherly love and social intercourse are in their mind the two great evidences or results of this truth, and thus they are deceived.<a name=346:6></a> But however satisfied they may be with themselves, they never come to the knowledge of it divinely, but subvert in principle what they profess to know, and therefore they are, as Sanballat and Geshem in a former day (<a href="../bible/Nehemiah.htm#6:2">Nehemiah  6:2</a>), to be especially resisted and avoided.<a name=346:7></a> The great thing for the faithful to note is the form in which Satan seeks to undermine this truth.<a name=346:8></a> Each corps of adversaries is to be known by its facings.<a name=346:9></a> But I press that nothing shows the importance of this truth more than the peculiarity of the weapons which have been used to neutralise it, and by those too who in conscience consider they are upholding it.<a name=346:10></a> The more one has the anointed eye, the more one is astonished at the art and subtlety in which

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But besides the Holy Spirit being here to comfort and establish the individual saint, and to unite each to the other in one body with the Head in heaven, He is dwelling here to witness for Christ; He is the power of testimony for the absent Christ.<a name=347:5></a> The Jew, to whom God had committed the lively oracles, has rejected the Son of God; and the gentile has used the sword of power, which God had placed in man's hands, against the Lord of glory.<a name=347:6></a> Man had in a twofold way proved his unfitness to be the agent for Christ in His absence.<a name=347:7></a> Hence the Holy Spirit is sent down to dwell here, not only to comfort the hearts of the saints, but to testify of Christ, convicting the world, giving evidence of its guilt, and of God's judgment.<a name=347:8></a> So distinctly and altogether is the Holy Spirit the instrument of all power that He does not, and could not, accept co-operation or countenance from man as man or from the world, seeing that He is evidence of the world's position before God, and also that He is able to effect everything by Himself according to the mind of God.<a name=347:9></a> No human means of any kind whatsoever can impart or secure divine comfort to our hearts, and neither can any other than the Holy Spirit testify for Christ.<a name=347:10></a> If through faith I accept Him for the one, I must accept Him for the other; for I am really weak in my apprehension of the first, which I

		No one can question that there is a right point to start from, and that there is a first circle of interest to the heart of Christ; and that whatever is first to the Lord must be first to His servants.<a name=349:3></a> The first thing to be assured of is the circle of interest which is first with Him.<a name=349:4></a> The church, the bride-elect, is His first circle.<a name=349:5></a> He "loved the church, and gave himself for it; .<a name=349:6></a>.<a name=349:7></a>.<a name=349:8></a> For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church".<a name=349:9></a> He is now sanctifying it, having purged it by the washing of water by the word.<a name=349:10></a> Now as the church is Christ's first circle of interest on earth, so every servant, in order to be right, must start from it.<a name=349:11></a> This being conceded, let us see how the work of Christ can be carried on in keeping with it.<a name=349:12></a> First, let us see how Scripture insists on this truth.<a name=349:13></a> In <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>the Lord, consequent on His rejection looming before Him after the death of John the baptist, conducts the disciples to the new ground, practically defined by "the other side" and "no bread" (verse 5), and they then learn, not through flesh and blood, but through revelation from the Father, that Jesus is the Son of God, and that He is the Rock, the new ground, and the foundation on which He builds His church.<a name=349:14></a> Here is disclosed the great circle of His interest on His being rejected; and every builder

	<div class="paragraph">
		If many a true saint loses the place of being a friend, because he does not start from the right circle, there are more who fail in devotedness, because they accept a lower sphere for its origin and claim than the church.<a name=352:7></a> They satisfy themselves that they are devoted because they are enough so for the line of interest which claims their attention, and this is true in itself.<a name=352:8></a> But then this devotedness would not be considered sufficient even by themselves, were they to see that the first circle of Christ's interest, the church, was the sphere where they were to begin their devotedness, and where it was to be born.<a name=352:9></a>

		Now in 1 Corinthians, in company with the saints as the one loaf (chapter 10), one has discerned the Lord's body in death, and therefore has judged oneself in chapter 11; the new sphere is opened out in chapter 12, where the fact that we are baptised by one Spirit into one body is insisted on; and therefore in chapter 13 we are fitted for service according as we have charity.<a name=352:10></a> Charity is shown to be a surrender of all selfishness, and the effect of the grace of Christ in ourselves.<a name=352:11></a> For

		The second quality necessary for a servant is viewing or judging of man, and of everything, as they are in the eyes of God, or in relation to Him.<a name=371:3></a> As the first is the virtue of the 'forlorn hope' who counted not their lives dear unto themselves, in order that they might secure the interests of Christ; the next is, that as I see Him in His glory, so am I able to judge of everything of man as in relation to Him.<a name=371:4></a> It is in proportion as I see Him thus that I can judge of what is of man; but if I only see the height partially, I can only judge of the depth partially.<a name=371:5></a> In the epistle to the Ephesians we get this contrast.<a name=371:6></a> When we are set in the highest elevation, as in chapter 1, then the greatest disclosure is made of the corruption of man in the flesh, in chapter 4.<a name=371:7></a> It is only as the servant knows his connection with God that he can refuse what is contrary to Him, and be really and truly for the Lord among men.<a name=371:8></a> Moses was pre-eminently qualified for being the Lord's servant, at the time when in answer to his own request, "Shew me thy glory", his face shone from the effect of it.<a name=371:9></a> He had witnessed many a wonder from the hand of God, and had been the instrument of many; but now, when Israel worshipped a calf, he for the first time requests to see the glory of God; and the effect is that his face shines, and thereby the distance is exposed which is morally between man and God.<a name=371:10></a> They "could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance".<a name=371:11></a> Thus too with Isaiah, in chapter 6; he is not fit to be a prophet in the lowest state of things in Israel until he has learned that before the King, the

		The saint is turned aside, or looks to things behind, from two causes; one, from the pressure of circumstances, and the other, because of the attractions of things here.<a name=375:10></a> We find these personated in <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#2">Proverbs  2</a>; one is the man of evil which causes fear, the other, the woman of flattery.<a name=375:11></a> From the first the Lord mercifully restores, when the heart is awakened to repentance; from the latter, when persisted in, there is no restoration as to testimony, though salvation be not forfeited.<a name=375:12></a> We get an instance of the first in Abram in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#12">Genesis  12</a>, when from the pressure of famine he went down into Egypt.<a name=375:13></a> Again Jonah, fearing service, flees to Tarshish; Peter from fear denies the Lord; Paul, pressed by James in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#21">Acts  21</a>, returns to Jewish things.<a name=375:14></a> There are several examples in scripture of the saint turning back from fear, or from the pressure of circumstances; and yet the Lord, who has compassion on us because of the weakness of our frame, restores him, and he is found again in the path of faith and obedience.<a name=375:15></a> If he had

		The effect of the revelation of Christ in glory to the heart of Saul of Tarsus was to awaken in him and draw from him the question, "What shall I do, Lord?<a name=395:3></a>" When one is truly convinced of the folly and evil of one's course hitherto, there arises necessarily in the heart and conscience this inquiry: What am I to do?<a name=395:4></a> How shall I act?<a name=395:5></a> The nature or the measure of the effect of the revelation of Christ to my heart is declared by the earnestness and simplicity in which I seek to know from Him what He would have me to do.<a name=395:6></a> When He absolutely fills the heart, conscious of its insubjection heretofore, and seeking now to yield itself altogether to Him, it utters the anxious question, "What wilt thou have me to do?<a name=395:7></a>"

		It is important to see that the first cause of unspiritual and unapproved real service can be traced to the weakness of the soul's apprehension of Christ's service to it.<a name=396:5></a> Every true observer must admit that there is a vast amount of zeal without knowledge, resulting in unsuited work, in the present day.<a name=396:6></a> Works are entered on because the necessities of the hour seem to suggest or require them, and not in simple obedience to Christ.<a name=396:7></a> No one can truly serve the Lord but as he knows the Lord's pleasure with respect to the service.<a name=396:8></a> He must be inwardly and outwardly fitted for it.<a name=396:9></a> The Lord does not employ unfitted servants for His work.<a name=396:10></a> He prepares them for it, imparts His own grace, so that "by the grace of God I am what I am".<a name=396:11></a>

		The happy and the really useful servant is the one who pleases his Lord.<a name=399:2></a> Unless this is the spring and motive of service there will be failure, and in order to please Him I must study Him.<a name=399:3></a> I shall never know what pleases the Lord unless I am constantly near Him, not by resorting to Him in prayer now and again, but rather by abiding in His company long enough to get the impression of it, like Moses on the mount, until I am coloured by His mind.<a name=399:4></a> If I do not sit at His feet and hear His word, I shall fall into one or another of the many mistakes as to service rife enough at this hour.<a name=399:5></a> I must not only hear His word, I must be in His company.<a name=399:6></a> Everything depends on this.<a name=399:7></a> There is no real comprehension of the word but in His presence; at least the moral range or claim of it cannot be apprehended anywhere else.<a name=399:8></a> If, as I have already endeavoured to show, this moral sense or claim be unknown, even though the purpose be true as with Moses, or the heart ready as with Martha, the service will be ineffectual and unapproved by the Master.<a name=399:9></a> Studying the Lord and His mind alone prepares for true and effectual service, and servants of this class refer all to His judgment, content to be unseen and unrecognised, provided that they are pleasing Him.<a name=399:10></a> To please the Master is the one satisfaction to their hearts.<a name=399:11></a> The two other classes who, while attempting service, lose sight of it in its highest sense, are, firstly, those who seek to carry out a right purpose in a wrong way, using any means for this purpose; and secondly, those who with a really loving heart determine what would please the Lord from their own idea of what is fitting in the circumstances.<a name=399:12></a> Moses when he slew the Egyptian is a type of the first, as is Peter when he cut off the ear of the high priest's servant, and John when he asked the Lord to call down fire from heaven.<a name=399:13></a> All these were true men, but were seeking

		Thus on the one hand we have to guard against seeking to accomplish right things by unspiritual means, and on the other, not to allow our own minds, or even man's need merely, to dictate to us what we are to do, because in either case we have declined from that nearness to the Lord, where His pleasure would have been communicated to us, and where His power would have supported us in keeping with His mind, and preserved us from the use of undue means and from being influenced by visible things.<a name=401:7></a> Finally, I would repeat that the only way for a servant to avoid these two snares, or indeed to enter on service which is pleasing to the Lord, is first, that the heart should be assured of its base with God, and secondly, that the great question, "What shall I do, Lord?<a name=401:8></a>" should be resolved by the study of the Master's mind in His presence and apart from all human influences.<a name=401:9></a>

		From the beginning there was some special truth revealed to which alone, for the time, the testimony of the Lord was attached.<a name=402:1></a> The truth was committed to some chosen vessel, and if it was accepted, the servant through whom it came was well received, but according as the truth was rejected, so was he refused.<a name=402:2></a> The treatment of the servant to whom the truth is committed is the index of the value which man attaches to the truth.<a name=402:3></a> If there has always been a truth which bore this great mark, "the testimony of the Lord", how much more must it be so now, when the word or the counsel of God is fulfilled; see <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:25">Colossians  1:25</a>.<a name=402:4></a> To the apostle Paul the final testimony of the Lord was committed; and when the saints were ashamed of that testimony, they were ashamed of the servant, His prisoner.<a name=402:5></a> "All they which are in Asia be turned away from me", writes the apostle in <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1:15">2 Timothy  1:15</a>.<a name=402:6></a>

		Thus they proved their disregard for the Lord's testimony in the way in which they disregarded His servant, who was the apostle of it.<a name=402:7></a> It is important to see, first, that there was always a special truth with which the testimony of the Lord was connected; and secondly, that the effort of the enemy is to divert the people of God from it, and to hinder them from strictly and fully maintaining it; while on the other hand, wherever there was faith in any, even in the darkest moment, there was always distinct succour from God to enable them to do so.<a name=402:8></a> Only faith in God could surmount the opposition which the people of God had to encounter in maintaining the testimony at any given time.<a name=402:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The trial of man was closed on the cross.<a name=403:5></a> Every previous dispensation had placed him under trial, and the testimony of the Lord at that time, if it had been maintained, would have given man some place as man; it conferred distinction on man according as he maintained it.<a name=403:6></a> Had Adam maintained the testimony given to him in Eden, he would have added distinction to himself.<a name=403:7></a> Had Noah maintained the testimony committed to him, he would have distinguished himself.<a name=403:8></a> Had the fathers, had Israel done so, they would have risen in the scale and secured a name for man in the flesh, as subject to God.<a name=403:9></a> But in each and all, man failed, and finally proved his entire ruin in his inability to comprehend the excellence of every divine and human beauty in the Person of the Son, God manifested in flesh.<a name=403:10></a>

		If man was found incompetent to maintain the testimony of the Lord when the maintenance of it would have exalted himself, how evident it is that he can get no place in that testimony which is subsequent to the cross, where the history of man under trial closes.<a name=403:11></a> We must bear in mind that our blessed Lord was refused both as a Man on earth, and as a Man in heaven.<a name=403:12></a> "He came unto his own, and his own received him not".<a name=403:13></a> They said, "This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours".<a name=403:14></a> So they cast Him out

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The trial of man was over on the cross, in the death of our Lord Jesus Christ, whom God has set forth as a propitiation for our sins, "that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus".<a name=404:6></a> The testimony is of the Lord Jesus Christ, the one Man who has entirely met the mind of God in everything, and who also has appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself.<a name=404:7></a> It altogether ignores man as he was under trial before the cross, there is no offer to him to recover himself, and the maintaining of the testimony now would in nowise add distinction to him, but the reverse, because the testimony now is of the One who died for him, and who, when refused and disallowed of man, was called by God to His own right hand.<a name=404:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before the death of Christ, while man was under trial, although the maintenance of the testimony always required divine power, yet, as it was maintained, whether by Noah, Abraham or Moses, it gave distinction and place to each, as men in the flesh.<a name=404:9></a> But the cross sets man aside in a double way.<a name=404:10></a> In it there is atonement for man's sin, which of itself is evidence that there was nothing in man through which he could live before God, and that there was no other way but the death of Christ to reconstitute him according to the mind of God, or to plant him in the likeness of Christ.<a name=404:11></a> Therefore, if man in the flesh be allowed a place now, there must be at the start an incapacity to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the failure of "all who are in Asia" is that to which every saint in the present day has a tendency, or is in danger of, even though he may have suffered on account of it; for those who turned away from it in the apostle's day had been personally taught and led by himself.<a name=405:5></a> It is not that the truth of christianity as a whole is relinquished, but there is a return to a previous testimony in order to escape the peculiar and exacting nature of this, the greatest of testimonies.<a name=405:6></a> Hence for nearly 1800 years this great testimony has been in abeyance, and now that through unspeakable mercy it has been revived, we are not one whit more secure against the adversary than were those in Asia.<a name=405:7></a> The danger of those who have learned the testimony is that, while owning the truth as the Colossians did, they should reduce it to a theory; for instance, holding the doctrine of the unity of the body merely as a doctrine, instead of as the known result of union with the Head.<a name=405:8></a> Hence the apostle had great agony for them, that they might realise and enjoy the unprecedented blessedness

		Many saints are conscious of deficiency and want of power who cannot tell the cause of it.<a name=407:3></a> No one can prescribe a remedy until he discover the need, but many, after they have become acquainted with the need of the church, or of individual saints, cannot tell what is the true remedy.<a name=407:4></a> Like unskilled physicians, they try many remedies; but though actual collapse be prevented by the exercise of heart which there is in trying the remedies, yet the same spiritual need as to its type and nature still continues.<a name=407:5></a> Surely almost every conscientious saint can see the great need spiritually of individual souls, and of the church in general; but as a rule they fail in relieving or removing it, because they have not discovered the true remedy.<a name=407:6></a> In Scripture there is but the one remedy for any particular defect, and unless one is taught of the Lord to use the spiritual specific, there is no true remedy; and this accounts for so much time being expended in seeking and in doing what in the end proves to be profitless.<a name=407:7></a>

		It is a truth entirely belonging to the time of Christ's rejection; it was never revealed until Paul's conversion.<a name=408:4></a> Many and various were the energies of divine grace in souls, in great power and zeal, before this truth and the virtues it confers were made known; but those energies, though great and excellent, never did rise up to or participate in union with Christ, which holding the Head implies, and which therefore confers a greater privilege and order of power than could have been known by any saint previous to the ascension of Christ.<a name=408:5></a> If saints would admit and maintain that holding the Head is the main point, the heart and seat of life for all personal and relative action in the church of God, there would be a given centre for all saints; and according as it was insisted on and preserved with integrity, the refusal and extirpation of everything contrary to it would be simple and easy.<a name=408:6></a> I am very far from making little of the faith or zeal of any of the saints of God before the resurrection of the Lord, but I do say that no saint before that great event could know the privilege and virtue of being united to Him who is the Son of God.<a name=408:7></a> But unless souls see the magnitude of this grace, they cannot be exercised as to the gain of accepting it or the loss of overlooking it.<a name=408:8></a> Almost every kind of divine virtue was displayed in the line of witnesses from Abel downwards, but in none of them, I need hardly say, was there perfection.<a name=408:9></a> This perfection was in the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God.<a name=408:10></a> Now a saint might be equal to Abel, or Enoch, or Abram, or Moses, or Samuel,

		It is most important to see that at no former period could the same manner or measure of grace be imparted to a saint as there is now to every one true to his calling.<a name=410:14></a> When the disciples accompanied our Lord on the earth, they were undoubtedly made familiar <i>par excellence</i> with what was most blessed.<a name=410:15></a> But though they were with Him and enjoyed the charm and blessing of His presence, yet they were not in moral company with Him.<a name=410:16></a> He was alone.<a name=410:17></a> To have enjoyed His company as a Man, and to have participated in the wondrous shelter and love which His wing afforded them, was indeed their unique privilege, but they were in no wise like Him; they were at home with Him, but they were not united to Him.<a name=410:18></a> He was not their known Head, though He was their support, and the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.<a name=410:19></a> But now we are united to Him above, and we feed on Him as He was here on the earth; the life of Jesus is manifested in the body.<a name=410:20></a> Again, on the holy mount, though some of them saw Him transfigured, and heard the voice from the excellent glory, and were

		Again, when the Lord was risen from the dead, and when He showed Himself to His disciples in this new and transcendent way, they were quite conscious of His wondrous state.<a name=411:3></a> They had the peculiar and unspeakable gladness of seeing Him triumphant over all the ruin brought in by man.<a name=411:4></a> But though they were in a degree conscious of the new and bright day now inaugurated for them through Him, they did not really partake of it, as in it with Him, because the Holy Spirit had not as yet descended to unite them to Him the Head.<a name=411:5></a> They saw the Head, they heard what He would confer on them, but they were not yet one spirit with the Lord, nor could they enjoy resurrection as He enjoyed it, though they could rejoice in the risen Lord.<a name=411:6></a> Thus neither in His walk, nor in His transfiguration, nor after His resurrection, were His disciples, though most highly favoured, made acquainted similarly in any degree with His state at the time, because they were not united to Him.<a name=411:7></a> And therefore the weakest saint united to Him now tastes, as to degree, a greater thing than any of the disciples in any period of His life on earth.<a name=411:8></a>

		HOW DECLENSION BEGINS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We enjoy "every spiritual blessing" by faith, that is, we attain to it by faith, and yet no blessing is acquired by attainment.<a name=423:1></a> Every spiritual blessing is ours through grace; faith appropriates what is ours already, yet every one does not enjoy what is really his own, because he has not faith to lay hold of it.<a name=423:2></a> "If ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?<a name=423:3></a>" "Faith is .<a name=423:4></a>.<a name=423:5></a>.<a name=423:6></a> the evidence of things not seen".<a name=423:7></a> You attain by faith, and as you walk by faith, there is progress; but the moment you look at what you have attained to, you turn from faith, which always reaches on to a still fuller evidence of things not seen; you are declining, and the simple reason of your declension is that you are not in the energy of the Spirit of God.<a name=423:8></a> You are not following after, that you may apprehend that for which you are apprehended of Christ Jesus.<a name=423:9></a> You have by faith reached a certain truth, and you accept it as your standing; but when that which you have reached becomes prominent, then faith, which alone can keep you up to it, and which enables you really to enjoy it, wanes, and you are declining.<a name=423:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Declension does not begin with surrendering the standing, but with losing the state which answers to the standing; that is, you are not holding in faith what you have reached in faith.<a name=423:11></a> You are contenting yourself with your attainment.<a name=423:12></a> Faith is a power which is only sustained while it is in exercise, as a bird only knows the power of flying while it is flying, or as a steam-engine is useless without steam.<a name=423:13></a> No motion from previous activity will continue when a bird ceases to fly, or a steam-engine ceases to act; no past performance can prolong the power of either.<a name=423:14></a> Thus when faith is unexercised, no former faith can impart or confer any enjoyment or prospect.<a name=423:15></a> The fact that I have seen a

	<div class="paragraph">
		The desire and the tendency to consider for one's natural feelings and wants is, when yielded to, the beginning of declension; I myself am more before my mind than God.<a name=424:6></a> Hence, when Abraham in the path of faith had by faith reached the true place or standing to which he was called, he drops out of faith for a time because of the pressure of circumstances, the famine, and goes down to Egypt; <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#12:10">Genesis  12:10</a>.<a name=424:7></a> He does not actually retrace his steps, or say that he made a mistake in coming into the land, but he does not keep in faith what he has reached by faith.<a name=424:8></a> Without doubt faith had brought him to the desired place; and he lost it, not because he could not get up to it, but because he could not keep it after possessing it.<a name=424:9></a> It was not right nor title he failed in, but in the power that brought him there, and he turned aside to Egypt.<a name=424:10></a> Memory then could only have proved his declension, because if he remembered having been between Bethel and Hai, it was only a proof that he was not there now.<a name=424:11></a> It is thus with many nowadays; they betray themselves and their present declension, when they talk of what they were by faith years ago.<a name=424:12></a> A man who recalls you to what he used to be is like a superannuated soldier, who is clearly not in the vigour of active service now.<a name=424:13></a>

		Jacob had gone through much before he recovered his true standing in returning to the land, and had known deep exercises of soul after he had reached it; yet even after all this, and after the name of Israel is given him in chapter 32, declension sets in.<a name=425:7></a> He surrenders faith which required him to go on up to Bethel, and settles down at Shalem, where he tries to quiet his conscience by religiousness, erecting an altar the very name of which exposes his true state, and discloses that he had lost faith, and had become occupied exclusively with what God was to him, having lost sight of what God is in Himself.<a name=425:8></a> Jacob at this stage of his history represents that class of saints who look for mercies on earth, and would limit God to themselves, as if they were His object on the earth.<a name=425:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		One more example; when the captives, on their return to Jerusalem, were prevented from building the temple, they at length accepted it as inevitable (<a href="../bible/Ezra.htm#4:24">Ezra  4:24</a>), and devoted themselves to their own blessing, which they were zealous enough in seeking; see <a href="../bible/Haggai.htm#1">Haggai  1</a>They had suffered much to regain their lost inheritance, yet from lack of faith they grew indifferent about the chief thing, the house of God.<a name=426:5></a> In like manner many in the present day, while seeking their own enjoyment and blessing, often lose sight of what is due to Christ on earth; and their efforts, even for themselves prove ineffectual.<a name=426:6></a> "Ye looked for much, and, lo, it came to little; and when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it.<a name=426:7></a> Why?<a name=426:8></a> saith the Lord of hosts.<a name=426:9></a> Because of mine house that is waste, and ye run every man unto his own house".<a name=426:10></a> The sum of the matter is this: faith always holds on to what the word of God by the Spirit reveals to the soul, and when faith is in exercise, then assuredly God is before the soul, in a scene where everything is of man, the more I walk with God, the more absolutely must it be by faith.<a name=426:11></a> Hence when faith wavers there is declension; knowledge is not lost, but all spiritual progress is stopped.<a name=426:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now when we come to the New Testament, it is all different.<a name=429:7></a> In it we have God manifest in the flesh, the record of Him in four different aspects, and how man answered to it.<a name=429:8></a> It was not a mere revelation, but it was God manifest in the flesh, walking among men, doing everything in divine perfection; and every response or return made to Him by man disclosed what man was in relation to God, because God was there beside man, clothed in the humble garments of a man.<a name=429:9></a> Thus man was thoroughly tested.<a name=429:10></a> This we have in the gospels.<a name=429:11></a> But when the Lord, being rejected and ascended on high, having led captivity captive, gives gifts unto men, now for the first time true ministry by gifts really begins.<a name=429:12></a> It is not merely, as at first, revelation to guide the saint, nor is it the prophets to recall what was already given, while pronouncing judgment, or foretelling the eventual state, even "new heavens and a new earth, wherein

		Thus the use of ministry is incalculable.<a name=430:10></a> No study of the word for oneself can ever supersede ministry.<a name=430:11></a> No one possesses all the gifts in himself, and yet if he does, he is dependent on his gift for edification, and not on his mere knowledge of Scripture.<a name=430:12></a> No soul indifferent to the gifts can be perfected.<a name=430:13></a> The word of life may and often does reach the soul apart from any apparent instrumentality, but there is not progress without appreciation of the gifts; as I know the nurture and admonition of the Lord I value the gifts.<a name=430:14></a> Ministry by gifts is the great evidence of the exaltation of Christ.<a name=430:15></a> "He .<a name=430:16></a>.<a name=430:17></a>.<a name=430:18></a> gave gifts unto men".<a name=430:19></a> The gifts are the means, divinely

		I shall now call attention to the various ways in which ministry is regarded.<a name=431:3></a> I shall not refer to the use superstition makes of it, except so far as it leavens the saints.<a name=431:4></a> First then there are some who disregard ministry, and say that they can learn from the Bible for themselves.<a name=431:5></a> These gradually sink to a low standard of truth, or they become unsound because they have not subjected their own thoughts to the scrutiny of gifted men beside themselves.<a name=431:6></a> It is reducing the whole of the circle of Christ's interest and power to an individual, and therefore something unnatural and preposterous must be the result; and if bad in a man, how much worse in a woman!<a name=431:7></a> Paul communicated the gospel he preached to the apostles privately (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2">Galatians  2</a>) lest by any means he should run, or had run, in vain.<a name=431:8></a> Self-taught men, who have not submitted their acquisitions from Scripture to the scrutiny of their brethren, are generally unsound.<a name=431:9></a> The best taught do not hesitate to invite discussion respecting the truths they have seen, and thus have been only confirmed in them and enabled the better to expound them.<a name=431:10></a> Those who fall into the snare of rejecting ministry are but drones in the hive; they derive from it, but add not to it; they are never bright, and never concerned for Christ's interests on the earth, however interested they may be in works of philanthropy; they condemn every one but themselves.<a name=431:11></a> Secondly, there are those who have their favourites as to ministry; these border on having "itching ears"; they consult their own tastes, and the minister is the impersonation of those tastes, while at the same time he presents truth sufficient to satisfy their conscience.<a name=431:12></a> They are bound to him, not as to a pastor, whose care and knowledge of them personally might entitle him to a special place

		with them; and indeed if he were such, he would expose and condemn the gross partiality which led them to confine themselves to the ministry of only one of the Lord's servants, as the Corinthians did, when they said, "I am of Paul; and I of Apollos".<a name=432:1></a> A soul might as well expect to grow and advance when warped by this exclusive partiality, as a man could expect to be constitutionally in vigour, who devotes his whole attention and energies to the cultivation of one sense.<a name=432:2></a> The Spirit is given to every man to profit withal, and the value and use of ministry is lost sight of and unappropriated when only one person, be he even Paul or Cephas, is the sole oracle, the one you class yourself under; for no one saint can say that he is exclusively of Christ.<a name=432:3></a> We are all of Christ, and all the gifts are ours in common too.<a name=432:4></a> Contentions and eccentricities are the result of this abuse of ministry.<a name=432:5></a> Such are not practically governed by the truth, however great and devoted their assumed patron, they have "men's persons in admiration".<a name=432:6></a>

		Thirdly, there are those who are Athenian in their character; who like some new thing; <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#17:21">Acts  17:21</a>.<a name=432:7></a> They like going to hear where they are interested.<a name=432:8></a> Good words and fair speeches greatly affect them; they like to be acted on, and the remarkable and painful consequence is that, as a rule, those who seek to be acted on rarely act out the word and truth of God.<a name=432:9></a> It is for solemn warning to every minister, lest he should intermix with the word of God that which can meet the human mind, and thus damage souls by constructing that which is unreal, forgetting the commission to the minister, namely, "But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts".<a name=432:10></a> This class tends to produce those who are "ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth".<a name=432:11></a>

		They always apply themselves to the understanding of the word, because it is as the word is understood that the conscience is ruled by it, and their one desire is to be governed by it.<a name=433:1></a> They are often less quick in apprehension of its meaning than the less conscientious and the sentimental, but they always value the close and direct exposition of the word of God ministered in the quiet solemnity which always marks one who is himself controlled by what he expounds.<a name=433:2></a> It is not a mere vision which excites him, but a reality that he himself is in, and into which he seeks to conduct others.<a name=433:3></a>

		HOLINESS -- WHAT IS IT?
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Innocence in itself is not holiness.<a name=433:5></a> Adam in the garden of Eden was innocent, he had no idea of what evil was; but as soon as he ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he knew evil, because he had committed it.<a name=433:6></a> Evil governed him and innocence was lost.<a name=433:7></a> Now the separation from evil by the introduction or maintenance of what is of God is holiness.<a name=433:8></a> Mere suppression of vice is not holiness.<a name=433:9></a> Where evil is regnant -- since "in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing" -- a vice may be suppressed in order to obtain more reputation for oneself, or to secure more self-satisfaction; but this exertion of the natural powers only increases the sense and strength of one's own independence of God.<a name=433:10></a> It is not holiness, because it is not God who is ruling, but man's natural power is exerted to improve himself.<a name=433:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To understand what holiness is, the first thing is a standard.<a name=433:12></a> Everything depends on the standard; the standard is Christ.<a name=433:13></a> The Scripture says, "Be ye holy, for I am holy" -- "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect".<a name=433:14></a> If the standard be man, then the holiness must necessarily be defined by whatever renders a man commendable, and anything

	<div class="paragraph">
		which would not compromise one's character in the eyes of man, nor offend against man's sensibilities, would be considered holiness.<a name=434:1></a> It is constantly the case that a christian's sensibilities, which the company or influence of pious people institutes and fosters, become the standard by which holiness is determined; so much so, that I have known instances where though the smallest departure from good conduct would not be tolerated, yet false doctrine was suffered on the condition that it would not be propagated or discussed.<a name=434:2></a> In such cases sensibilities have been produced and educated by christian principles, and the standard of holiness was man's feelings and not God's will.<a name=434:3></a> Now in all theological systems, the great defect on the subject of holiness is that the thing to be effected is the great problem before the mind, and not the standard to which we are to be transformed.<a name=434:4></a> There may be a true and earnest desire to be holy, but the mind is occupied with the attainment, and not with the One who alone can effect it, and whose influence and power alone can suppress the evil and express what is of God.<a name=434:5></a> It is as if a plant were to occupy itself with the effect of the sun instead of with the sun itself, and turn all its leaves and branches downward, instead of upward to appropriate its rays, assured that the effect would thereby descend to the roots.<a name=434:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The true way of exposing defects or errors respecting any truth is to insist on the truth itself in its simplicity.<a name=434:7></a> The thing desired is holiness, to be partakers of His holiness.<a name=434:8></a> Well, we must start with this, that in our flesh dwells no good thing, nothing to suit God.<a name=434:9></a> Now holiness is something to suit God; it must be of God.<a name=434:10></a> His holiness is what I desire.<a name=434:11></a> I have through grace a new nature, I am a new creation, I am born of God; I sin not in that creation.<a name=434:12></a> The power of this creation is not natural power; it is the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, and this is the second thing.<a name=434:13></a> Now as the Holy Spirit acts in me, the new nature is in concert, but I am

		in the old creation in which dwells no good thing, because I have in Adam surrendered it to the ruling principle of evil.<a name=435:1></a> The standard of holiness for me is Christ; the power, the Holy Spirit.<a name=435:2></a> The Holy Spirit is in me in consequence of the redemption obtained by Christ and therefore comes down to me from Him the glorified Man, asserting and insisting on His right and claim to make my body the instrument of setting forth His ways on earth.<a name=435:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The body is the temple of the Holy Spirit.<a name=435:4></a> It is bought with a price, and I am to glorify God in my body, which is His.<a name=435:5></a> The saint is set here with a new nature, the Holy Spirit dwelling in him.<a name=435:6></a> He has no conscience of sins, because he is brought to God through the sacrifice of Christ, and is by one offering perfected for ever; and therefore he is not debtor to the flesh to live after the flesh, for he is dead in Christ, in that wherein he was held.<a name=435:7></a> And therefore if he lives after the flesh, there is death; but if through the Spirit he mortifies the deeds of the body he shall live.<a name=435:8></a> Now this is the great aim of the saint here, that Christ should be magnified in his body.<a name=435:9></a> The flesh is in the body, but the Holy Spirit makes it His temple; having first built, as it were, a house for Himself in the new creation, He then lives in it, and He mortifies the workings of the flesh, and brings forth divine fruits; this is the continued action of the Holy Spirit, because there is a new and peculiar demand at every turn.<a name=435:10></a> There is never the same thing occurring again as to every particular; and every occurrence and change of scene acts in one way or another on the flesh, that is, on man's will; and unless mortified by the Holy Spirit, it leads and masters him.<a name=435:11></a> There is no such thing as holiness in the flesh.<a name=435:12></a> The flesh is repressed by the Spirit; and in its place He sets forth Christ; but there is the ever recurring sense of the existence of the flesh and its readiness to rise up and act, as well as the conviction that there is no power to reduce or control it but the Holy Spirit; and this

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thirdly, two things mark growth in holiness; one is a deeper sense of man's corruption, the other a greater zest and longing after Christ only.<a name=436:4></a> The corruption is discovered and felt as the power of the Spirit increases; for many a thought and act passes without pain to the conscience where Christ is less before the soul, which will be refused and condemned as the knowledge of Christ increases in spiritual power in the soul.<a name=436:5></a> Thus the word of God penetrates "even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart".<a name=436:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One is shocked at the once unnoticed motive which has governed one, or at least which has sought to do so; but the very inclination to act selfishly is unholy.<a name=436:7></a> If I desire what I have no right to appropriate I am unholy, even though I do not attempt to appropriate it.<a name=436:8></a> If the flesh were holy, things that now invite it would get no response.<a name=436:9></a> I have not only to guard against the invitation, but I have to mortify the readiness to respond, the readiness in my flesh to desire even when there is not power to act.<a name=436:10></a> "The flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh".<a name=436:11></a> That shows that the flesh is still there, and they are "contrary the one to the other"; but the Spirit gets the upper hand, "that ye cannot do the things that ye would".<a name=436:12></a> As the Spirit acts, as Christ the perfect One is maintained in me, the principles and desires of the old man are superseded.<a name=436:13></a> The one is repressed in order that the other may be expressed; and hence the greater my knowledge of Christ, the more do I detect the contrast, and discern through the Spirit what is contrary to Christ.<a name=436:14></a>

		I am daily more humbled and broken because of my own corruption and while rejoicing that I am crucified with Christ, I always bear about in my body the dying of Jesus, that the life of Jesus may be made manifest in my body.<a name=437:1></a> I have no remedy for it but in death, in Christ's death; but not only this, but the life of Jesus is to be manifested in my body.<a name=437:2></a> There is therefore more real brokenness about the one who begins in the light to see himself as he is in the flesh -- he abhors himself; and at the same time there is a more intense desire and seeking after the beauty of the Lord, so that brokenness of spirit and earnestness of heart characterise the one in whom the Spirit of God is unhindered.<a name=437:3></a> I cannot understand the beauty of the Lord but as I am in His presence, and the better I understand it, the more clearly I see and detect that which is of the flesh, because whatever is not the Lord's will is my own will, and that is sin.<a name=437:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		When a saint declines, there is a surrender of both.<a name=437:5></a> Things once feared and disallowed are first tolerated and then promoted; and the earnest cleaving to the Lord with purpose of heart gives place to a sort of complacency, and a recounting of how much one has gained or advanced.<a name=437:6></a> As I understand the ways and motives of the Holy One, I must be increasingly abashed in myself, and intensely more eager, because of the Spirit -- who shows me what I am in contrast to Christ -- to walk as He walked.<a name=437:7></a>

		Sanctification is a subject of great interest.<a name=437:8></a> The truth sanctifies; that is, it controls the heart or mind through the Spirit for God, making it instrumental for the display of Christ.<a name=437:9></a> The measure of this sanctification is Christ's own.<a name=437:10></a> "For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth".<a name=437:11></a> That is, that His sanctification, and the nature or extent of it, might be reproduced in us; the same character, no lower order, no lesser quality.<a name=437:12></a> The more habitually one is governed by the Spirit of God, the more the dominion of the Spirit increases.<a name=437:13></a> When I grow in
