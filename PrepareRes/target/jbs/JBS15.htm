		I have been thinking of you moving to a new place in the wilderness.<a name=13:1></a> I see that there is no real happiness here until we accept this world as really a vast howling desert -- a dry and thirsty land where no water is.<a name=13:2></a> When we truly accept it as a place where there is nothing for the new man, then we look to the Lord alone as our resource:

		We are saved out of Egypt -- the world of judgment, by the death and resurrection of Christ, and we enter on His triumph, as we have walked through the Red Sea.<a name=13:8></a> His death -- the only way out of our own death, and thus not only are we in peace, but the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost.<a name=13:9></a> You first know the happy terms on which the blessed God is with you; next -- thou there may be a long interval, that the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made you free from the law of sin and death.<a name=13:10></a> You are not in liberty, but as you are in the life of Christ.<a name=13:11></a> Many have a sense of the love of God, and how He is towards them, who are not in liberty, that is, not living in the life of Christ.<a name=13:12></a> It is then you know Him in a new way, and you find your joys in that which ministers to His life.<a name=13:13></a> You are now peculiarly attached to Him; you were first drawn to Him by His work for you; now you know Him as your life, and you are so bound to Him in love that you can say, "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?<a name=13:14></a>" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:35">Romans  8:35</a>).<a name=13:15></a> Now the fact of living His life of itself reduces this world to a wilderness;

		The Lord grant that your happiness may not be from anything around you, but that you may so enjoy Christ outside of everything, that Jordan may be a real privilege to you -- liberation in death with Christ from everything here.<a name=14:11></a> This doubtless is the happiest moment for any one who is truly in the wilderness.<a name=14:12></a>

		MEDITATION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I see great importance in the Lord leading His disciples apart to rest awhile: "and when they were alone, he ex-pounded all things to his disciples" (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#4:34">Mark  4:34</a>).<a name=14:13></a> I am sure that the reading of the word and prayer are necessary, and that great help comes to us through ministry; yet there is another exercise which surpasses all the rest; indeed, the others are, I might say, invalid without it.<a name=14:14></a> I mean <i>meditation</i>.<a name=14:15></a> "Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#4:15">1 Timothy  4:15</a>).<a name=14:16></a> I believe that as your physical constitution requires

		SEPARATION IS LEARNT IN THE PRESENCE OF CHRIST
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The question in your letter is a very important one -- 'How to keep clear of what hinders'.<a name=17:1></a> You write, 'I used to think that separation was more from things without, but now I see that it is an inward work accomplished with God'.<a name=17:2></a> You are quite right; but the more you are separated unto God, the more you are in His light, the more will you be separate from things without, because you will feel that they are incongruous and inconsistent.<a name=17:3></a> Every Christian has a measure of separation; he separates according to his conscience.<a name=17:4></a> Thus with many their separation is up to their consciences.<a name=17:5></a> The conscience is a good <i>guard</i> but not a <i>guide</i>.<a name=17:6></a> The Lord is the guide by the Spirit or through the light of the word.<a name=17:7></a> It is as you know the Lord -- "In thy light shall we see light" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#36:9">Psalm  36:9</a>) -- that you learn separation.<a name=17:8></a> A separation which you saw was necessary and right last year would be no rule for you when the Lord is better known.<a name=17:9></a> I do not believe that you could have a sense of the moral disparity of things here until you <i>first</i> know the order of things which suits Him, and you cannot know this, but as you are in His presence.<a name=17:10></a> It is not merely reading nor praying in itself.<a name=17:11></a> I can describe it only by the Queen of Sheba in the presence of Solomon; she was so absorbed with Solomon and his things that there was "no more spirit in her".<a name=17:12></a> You get a sense in this nearness to Him of His holiness that you could not acquire anywhere else, and as you are transformed into <i>moral</i> correspondence to Him, you find that you have new tastes and new interests.<a name=17:13></a> You are not <i>trying</i> to have them, you have acquired them in His presence.<a name=17:14></a> Hence natural tastes and interests which previously had an acknowledged place are now superseded without any effort.<a name=17:15></a> You will get a good illustration of this in studying the difference between El-elohe-Israel and Bethel (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#33">Genesis  33</a>, 35).<a name=17:16></a> Your altar, or morally your approach to God, indicates the measure of your relation to Him or His relation to you.<a name=17:17></a> Jacob was off the line at El-elohe-

		HIS HOME IS OUR HOME
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a time of deep blessing when you <i>realise</i>, though it is always true, that there is but a step between this world of sin and sorrow and the presence and home of the Lord.<a name=18:14></a> Instead of taking that step continually in spirit, the tendency is to seek for alleviation and relief here.<a name=18:15></a> Of course, if we did not receive mercy we could not exist here, but the question with me is -- Do we really regard His home as our home, or are we wanting Him to make our natural home comfortable?<a name=18:16></a> I believe all the present contention arises from ignorance in some, and from reluctance in others, to accept that Christ, <i>who is our life, is not here</i>.<a name=18:17></a> He <i>was</i> here, but He will never be here again as He was here.<a name=18:18></a> We are here, and we, as His word works in us, find His sympathy and support <i>here;</i> but to find <i>Himself</i>, we must <i>rise</i> with Him, and thus leave morally all this scene to which we are naturally attached.<a name=18:19></a> My comfort is that Christ lives in me; hence in things down here He enables me to walk, and to behave here as He did, and as I am in communion with Him, I know -- "because I

		As to new birth, as far as I understand, it is God's sovereign act <i>before</i> you have believed, and that it is thus stated in <a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>.<a name=19:9></a> Where it is said "born of God", it is in connection with faith.<a name=19:10></a> I believe Mr.<a name=19:11></a> -------- said 'The Son quickeneth always'; but in my judgment the point of that passage (<a href="../bible/John.htm#5:21">John  5:21</a>) is that man is raised out of death; the Son as Man -- the last Adam "quickeneth whom he will".<a name=19:12></a> I quite agree with you, that the more heavenly the truth is, the more difficult it is to explain, and therefore to communicate.<a name=19:13></a> 'It is an out-of-the-world condition of things.<a name=19:14></a>' It is outside of the conception and the sensibility of the human mind.<a name=19:15></a>

		The text I give you is, "Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24:67">Genesis  24:67</a>).<a name=20:1></a> The greatness of Christ's love is not known until union with Him is known.<a name=20:2></a> Then you know the love of Christ that passeth knowledge.<a name=20:3></a> I feel one has a very feeble conception of that love.<a name=20:4></a> Every believer loves Him for His work.<a name=20:5></a> That love likes to make much of Him, as the woman in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7">Luke  7</a>.<a name=20:6></a> Then comes the love of knowing that He is your life: you are in Him.<a name=20:7></a> You suffer now for Him and with Him.<a name=20:8></a> Next, you love Him as indispensable to you -- the Priest who bears you above every pressure while in His company, so that you are without a cloud before God.<a name=20:9></a> You are then drawn away from the earth.<a name=20:10></a> Next, you seek Him at His own side of things in the assembly.<a name=20:11></a> Many turn to the assembly to gain something for themselves.<a name=20:12></a> The assembly is the only place where you can find Christ on the earth according to His present interests.<a name=20:13></a> When in gladness of heart you have found Him there, you are sure to be interested in His interests on the earth.<a name=20:14></a> The queen of Sheba illustrates the greatness of your gain when you behold Christ's glory as He is in the assembly.<a name=20:15></a> The more you are with Him, the more you seek to be under His full control.<a name=20:16></a> Then you learn Him as Head.<a name=20:17></a> Now your cup is full, and you come out here in His sensibilities and qualities.<a name=20:18></a> One step more and you are brought to the consummation of bliss.<a name=20:19></a> You realise that you are united to Him in heaven, and now you are in perfect concert with His mind, and you share His ability to do His pleasure; and now His love that passeth knowledge becomes known to you, and your one thought is to be descriptive of Him here.<a name=20:20></a> At first, you see, it is all <i>from</i> Him<i>to</i> you, but as you are really at His side you receive from Him <i>for Himself;</i> He is paramount, which is the proof that you are in the consciousness of union.<a name=20:21></a> I hope that you may fully enter into the purpose of God for you.<a name=20:22></a> I see that it is not enough now to desire the fair beauty of the Lord.<a name=20:23></a> No!<a name=20:24></a> there cannot be any confidential

	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe there is much conveyed in the Lord's words to Peter "Lovest thou Me", to promote devotedness.<a name=107:1></a> As loving is the highest and most enjoyable activity in God, so must it be in us.<a name=107:2></a> And in loving the Lord we are loving One who first loved us, in fact there could not be love otherwise, because if we love God we must know Him.<a name=107:3></a> How could we love one whom we do not know?<a name=107:4></a> In loving the Lord we love One who in no way checks our love, but who on the contrary draws it out and increases it, for He has Himself produced it in us by revealing His own love.<a name=107:5></a> It is said that love must have an ideal; that is, it has a standard to which, when it is true, its objects, in order to satisfy it, must come up; though among men, it is only that they fancy it.<a name=107:6></a> Love is an activity which cannot view with indifference the state of its object.<a name=107:7></a> With man therefore it is an advantage that love is blind.<a name=107:8></a> But with God, the activity of His love puts away in the cross of His Son the entire offending thing in judgment.<a name=107:9></a> That is, He righteously gets rid of our condition which is painful to His love, and hence, having "graced" us in the Beloved, His love has nothing to check it.<a name=107:10></a> It is not that He loves us in spite of our faults, but He can rest in His love, for there is nothing in us (as we are in Christ, entirely new before Him) any more to offend Him.<a name=107:11></a>

		What a complete satisfaction to His love!<a name=107:12></a> The very exactitude and inexorability of His righteousness subserve His love.<a name=107:13></a> Lessen the righteousness and you lessen the love.<a name=107:14></a> The love cannot allow anything in me that would be below the divine standard, for the standard of divine love is perfect in His eyes, and therefore God's standard must be what answers to Himself.<a name=107:15></a> We, in our love, are obliged to tolerate and excuse, because even in our ideas of perfection, we must make allowance for imperfection, or we must condemn ourselves, or be dishonest.<a name=107:16></a> God commends his love to us while we were yet sinners.<a name=107:17></a> He from His own side removes every atom of the offending thing,

		As to your question about communion, I think I should distinguish between communion, and <i>walking</i> in communion.<a name=112:5></a> I think it is quite possible to have had communion with God as to a certain <i>part</i> of His purpose and grace, and to have made no advance from that part; and yet it was true communion as far as it went, and one might even revert to it, as a known moment of power and enjoyment.<a name=112:6></a> I think, for instance, a soul may have a true sense of the value of the blood in the sight of God, and can always refer to that moment with delight and assured blessing; but he has to <i>revert</i>, which in itself proves that he is not in communion as a present thing, for if he were, he would connect the past with the present, and be conscious that the stream, small at the source, only widens and deepens as it proceeds, the first drop swelling by every fresh acquisition, but the present part of the stream imparting a force and sense of power and blessing which the first drop could not alone.<a name=112:7></a> If I have to revert to the first drop in order to prove that I have tasted of water in the desert, it proves that I am not now in full concert with the mind and thought of God in my course and journey, or in company with His interests and counsels, and thus through grace shaping myself in keeping with them.<a name=112:8></a> In the latter case I am <i>walking</i> in the light and have communion with Him.<a name=112:9></a> In the former case I only revert to a time when I was true to my calling, and had a sense in my soul of enjoying a certain blessing.<a name=112:10></a> That blessing

		In consequence of the misapprehension of what I said last Friday week, I trust I may trouble you with a short explanation.<a name=132:3></a> My simple intention was to lead souls to see and find the divine sphere which Canaan represents for their rest and occupation, and not the wilderness and its necessities, to which we would too much confine God's love and care for us.<a name=132:4></a> Once we are really through the Red Sea -- the death of Christ, we must be in <i>dependence</i> on God here -- and this we are taught in the wilderness.<a name=132:5></a> But as a Christian I have much more; I am <i>dead with</i> Christ, this is Jordan; and I am quickened and raised up with Him and made to sit together with Him in heavenly places, and that is Canaan.<a name=132:6></a>

		Now the question is, and the point of my teaching -- Where do I best learn the goodness and love of God?<a name=132:7></a> In the wilderness, from His care, thought and provision for me <i>here</i>, or in Canaan where cities I did not build and vineyards I did not plant are given to me, where the whole heart of God is in its own proper circle and sphere?<a name=132:8></a>

		For a saint to have solitude is of the deepest importance, because it is then the heart renews its acquaintance with Him who only has entrance into our most solitary retreats.<a name=147:7></a> When we are thoroughly alone and apart, He loves to be our visitor: it is, so to speak, the time for Him to come, like the ray of light which penetrates into the dark cavern wherever it can; and to the inmate of the cavern never was light more prized.<a name=147:8></a> I believe there are two things learned in solitude that cannot be learned otherwise -- one, that I see myself apart from every one and every thing, a very necessary matter; and the other, that I see the Lord in quite a peculiar light, in a singular and unique way, apart from everything and every one.<a name=147:9></a> His individuality, blessed be His name, comes out to me in solitude in a way it never does in a crowd.<a name=147:10></a> Canticles gives you very much the idea of this: what one is oneself when quite alone, and what He is to one thus alone.<a name=147:11></a> When I am alone with Him He obtains His singularly pre-eminent place, not as a Saviour, though He is that to faith; but He is known to the heart as the sun.<a name=147:12></a> He "rules the day", so that when all other objects are visible, He is still entirely pre-eminent, and the sense of His pre-eminence, well-known and <i>well-sustained</i>, is the most effectual resource for the heart all the day long, and abides with it through its most anxious engagements.<a name=147:13></a> In solitude with Him the value and resource He is to the heart are learned, and when busied in duties it turns to Him as the needle to the pole, or as the flower to the sun.<a name=147:14></a> Where the soul has

		I was happy myself at the meeting.<a name=176:7></a> I tried to bring out the difference between the effect on us of the sufferings of Christ and His glory.<a name=176:8></a> The one divests us of our misery, the other invests us with all that He is and does.<a name=176:9></a> I dwelt much on "He maketh me to lie down in green pastures", etc.<a name=176:10></a> (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#23:2">Psalm  23:2</a>).<a name=176:11></a> It is thus that I am <i>formed</i>.<a name=176:12></a> I come from a scene where all is divinely beautiful, to combat what is all contrariety.<a name=176:13></a> Oh!<a name=176:14></a> I see it better than I can express it.<a name=176:15></a> I come from the perfectly beautiful to a painful contrast.<a name=176:16></a> I <i>know</i> what is beautiful, and I cannot accept anything less.<a name=176:17></a>

		It has occurred to me that I might through the Lord's blessing be able to help you with reference to the subject of our conversation the other day.<a name=177:6></a> I think you have a very simple and earnest purpose to follow the Lord, and you seek to have more unbroken enjoyment in His presence.<a name=177:7></a> This is so true and real with you, that you think you would give up anything which would check or hinder it, were you convinced that it was a check or a hindrance.<a name=177:8></a> The fact is, in my judgment, that you, as is the case with many others, conclude that the true desire is enough, and you are disappointed that the desire is not fully gratified, because you are quite sure that it is of God.<a name=177:9></a> Of course the true desire is the chief thing; the heart cries out for the living God.<a name=177:10></a> This is the growth of the new being in you by the work of the Spirit, and were you without a will of your own and had no other tastes but the new ones, the presence of the new ones would be quite sufficient to ensure your being entirely led by them.<a name=177:11></a> But you are not, nor are any of us, without a will of your own and old tastes, and hence it is not enough to be assured that you have new tastes, or even to long for their gratification, you must with <i>equal step</i> deny and refuse the old tastes.<a name=177:12></a> If not, you grieve the Spirit and you open a door to the flesh; the barricade to keep it out is broken down, and

		I left the whole company and went straight to my own room!<a name=208:1></a> Surely many years elapsed and many sorrows were inflicted before I was able to sing as in the days of my youth, but the Lord remembered the best note in my heart all that time.<a name=208:2></a> There is, however, a very interesting fact in connection with this, and it is that we have to return to the point of departure -- to the first wrong step.<a name=208:3></a> In a way there can really be no advance from the first wrong step.<a name=208:4></a> The wrong step occurs when self, in <i>any</i> form, is paramount to the Lord.<a name=208:5></a> It is very solemn, while very interesting, to note the various influences which succeed in diverting men of God from His interests to seek their own interests first.<a name=208:6></a> Now, when this is the case there must be a wrong step, however good the object desired.<a name=208:7></a> As far as I can see no one advances, however lengthened the interval -- that is, no one ever really grows -- until the first wrong step is retraced, and <i>thence</i> starts afresh.<a name=208:8></a> Thus it was with Israel.<a name=208:9></a> Though forty years had elapsed, they had really made no advance to the land.<a name=208:10></a> In the wilderness they learned what God was in His gracious care of them, and they learned themselves; but they were no nearer the land at the end of forty years than at the beginning.<a name=208:11></a> The young generation, detached from their fathers, were then prepared to enter the land.<a name=208:12></a> It is very important to see that though they were learning themselves in the wilderness and the daily care of God, yet they had made no advance in the song that filled their hearts when they crossed the Red Sea.<a name=208:13></a> This explains the state of many.<a name=208:14></a> They have taken a wrong step, and, until it is retraced, they are as exiles, they have no enjoyment of their own country, though cared for by God in the most perfect way, and have real gain in increased dependence on God.<a name=208:15></a> Thus there are two things to interest you -- one of unspeakable cheer, that the Lord ever remembers your highest note of love and delight in Himself; and the other, that if you are not advancing according to that note, you have taken a wrong step which you will one day retrace, but in the interval you are learning because of the trials of the wilderness to be more dependent on God.<a name=208:16></a>

		THE EFFECT OF NATURAL INFLUENCE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think we do not sufficiently observe how easily an untoward influence is imbibed from our acquaintances in nature.<a name=217:7></a> They always address our nature whenever they at all please us, and when our nature is pleased we are injured.<a name=217:8></a> This really takes place when we are off our guard, and few like to continue what a soldier calls doing duty, ever braced in armour, no relaxation or remission; and we always displease our natural acquaintances when we are true to our new and proper nature in Christ, when we feel our distance and separation from them and are fully happy in it.<a name=217:9></a> We are always either cultivating the new nature or reviving the old.<a name=217:10></a> In the latter case we are injuring ourselves, and we are useless to those around us.<a name=217:11></a> In the former, we are alone in happy separation and acquiring ability to be useful.<a name=217:12></a> Faith must act above all influences, and therefore when any influence is admitted, faith is superseded.<a name=217:13></a> An unhealthy moral atmosphere does not immediately and distinctly impress us with the injury we sustain from it, but we always find that it affects first our weak point, whatever that may be.<a name=217:14></a> On the contrary, in a divine atmosphere our weak point is

		GOD FIRST ANSWERS FAITH, AND THEN CHASTENS FOR FAILING
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a great lesson to submit to difficulties which you have brought upon yourself without trying to extricate yourself from the difficulties, while judging that which brought you into them.<a name=218:3></a> If we cannot overcome where we are, we could not overcome anywhere.<a name=218:4></a> If we look simply to the Lord there is no fear but that we can overcome unless we are in a false position, and in that case overcoming would be to get out of it.<a name=218:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When there is true faith, God answers it independently of the walk, though He chastens for failure in the walk <i>after</i> He answers the faith.<a name=218:6></a> The nearer I am to the Lord the more plainly will He chide with me for failure; but what brings me near Him is my confidence in His love to receive and to succour me.<a name=218:7></a> It was faith in Peter after his failure to gird his fisher's coat about him and cast himself into the sea to go to Jesus (<a href="../bible/John.htm#21">John  21</a>).<a name=218:8></a> He could depend on the Lord's love, for He had often succoured him, and while the Lord answers his faith in meeting and receiving His disciple, He afterwards deals with his heart and conscience, and restores him fully.<a name=218:9></a>

		I think that when a soul is occupied with its need, it does not dwell on the love which has done the service.<a name=218:10></a> The service is the one thing before it, as with the woman who touched the hem of His garment.<a name=218:11></a> The woman in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7">Luke  7</a>loved much because she was forgiven much, but she <i>seeks</i> acquaintance with Him.<a name=218:12></a> Jonathan had this feeling for David, but this I submit is love for the service

		GOD'S WAYS IN ANSWERING PRAYER
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is evident that answers to prayer are not limited to promises, because it is written, "Whatsoever we ask, we receive of him" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:22">1 John  3:22</a>), and, "If we know that he hear us, .<a name=271:1></a>.<a name=271:2></a>.<a name=271:3></a> we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:15">1 John  5:15</a>).<a name=271:4></a> We must first accept that "we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us .<a name=271:5></a>.<a name=271:6></a>.<a name=271:7></a> And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:26">Romans  8:26</a>, 27).<a name=271:8></a> No Christian who is walking in the Spirit would like to get what is not the mind of the Spirit.<a name=271:9></a> Now if I know myself as a child of God saying Abba, Father by the Spirit of the Son, I am entitled to make known everything concerning myself unto God, who numbers the hairs of my head.<a name=271:10></a> Then, again, if I know that He hears me I know that I have the petitions that I desired of Him.<a name=271:11></a> If I am spiritually led -- that is, if I have the Spirit's mind -- I ask what is according to His will, and I <i>know</i> that He, so to speak, gives attention to my expressed desire, and am assured that He will comply with it.<a name=271:12></a> Now in regard to prayer, there are two conditions of soul for a Christian -- one who has the Spirit of adoption -- which necessarily are above the condition of soul of those to whom the words "After this manner pray ye" were used.<a name=271:13></a> At that time the Spirit had not descended to indwell believers.<a name=271:14></a> Jesus had not risen.<a name=271:15></a> But the two conditions of soul after the descent of the Holy Ghost, and the ascension of Jesus, I find spoken of in the epistles -- one is <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#4">Philippians  4</a>, where without any reservation I am told to make known all my requests, and having done so, I am to rest in peace.<a name=271:16></a> My Father knows all now, not only from His own omniscience, but He has heard <i>all from myself</i>.<a name=271:17></a> The second is in <a href="../bible/1John.htm#5">1 John  5</a>, 14, 15 "And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he heareth us: And if we know that he hear us, .<a name=271:18></a>.<a name=271:19></a>.<a name=271:20></a> we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him".<a name=271:21></a> In the first condition I know nothing of results, but the fact of my making

		known my anxieties to Him has been effective in garrisoning my <i>heart</i> and thoughts (not mind) in surpassing peace.<a name=272:1></a> In the second it is, <i>If I know</i> a something of God, namely, that He heard me, and if I know that He hears me, I know as the <i>consequence</i> that I have the petitions I desired of Him.<a name=272:2></a> But the answer may not be what I expected.<a name=272:3></a> I may not get exactly what I <i>think</i> I asked for.<a name=272:4></a> And here it is I believe that we remarkably fulfil that word, "We know not what we should pray for as we ought".<a name=272:5></a> For instance, Paul, when in the shipwreck, might have asked the Lord to let him serve Him in His church more extensively than ever, and even if he knew that God heard him, would he, I ask, have thought that his prayer was to be answered by his being imprisoned at Rome?<a name=272:6></a> And yet that was how "the mind of the Spirit" was answered.<a name=272:7></a> As <i>spiritual</i>, Paul would understand it, though naturally he would have thought that extended missionary apostolic labours would be the answer.<a name=272:8></a> Now we know that his imprisonment led to his most extensive service to the church reaching down to this very time, seeing that it was during it he wrote the most of the epistles.<a name=272:9></a> Take another case.<a name=272:10></a> Habakkuk, in chapter 3, prays for the revival of Jerusalem.<a name=272:11></a> God <i>heard</i> him, but if you had asked the prophet what revival do you count on?<a name=272:12></a> doubtless he would have answered -- a present one.<a name=272:13></a> But what says the Spirit of God?<a name=272:14></a> Your prayer is answered, but the revival will be in the day of glory.<a name=272:15></a> When we really depend on God about anything, He gives us the very best.<a name=272:16></a> He does not give a stone for a fish.<a name=272:17></a> On the contrary, He gives, if I may so, say a salmon when only a trout is asked for.<a name=272:18></a> I mean that He always surpasses our suggestion or conception when we <i>depend</i> on Him.<a name=272:19></a> We never had any gift from God yet which we had asked Him for, and waited on Him for, but it exceeded our own idea of it.<a name=272:20></a> We may mourn for quails, and they may be given to teach us our folly, but if we simply look to the Lord, and to Him only for anything, we shall know Him in either of the two ways that I have adduced.<a name=272:21></a>
