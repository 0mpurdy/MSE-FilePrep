		DEVOTEDNESS TO CHRIST - TWOFOLD
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think we little comprehend what Bethany was to the Lord.<a name=1:1></a> He was not only at home there because they rested in His love, but because He was understood.<a name=1:2></a> Mary does two things most pleasing to Him.<a name=1:3></a> She sits at His feet, hearing His word, and she anoints Him for the burying.<a name=1:4></a> The one shews that she appreciates His mind - what He had to unfold; the other, that the most fragrant thing in her possession goes into the tomb with Him.<a name=1:5></a> This is devotedness of a double kind; it is on the one hand to receive only from Him: to have no thought, no mind, but His; on the other, to declare plainly that what would most distinguish me in nature, I pass over to Him who has died here.<a name=1:6></a> It fills the house of Bethany with fragrance.<a name=1:7></a> What living one is worthy of it, if the One who has revealed the Father has died out of the scene?<a name=1:8></a> No doubt the knowledge of His mind enabled Mary to confide in Him in the hour of sorrow (<a href="../bible/John.htm#11">John  11</a>); and then she not only knows what His mind is, but she proves what He Himself is, when there was nothing to afford one ray of light; and this prepares her for anointing His body for the burying (<a href="../bible/John.htm#12">John  12</a>).<a name=1:9></a> Thus the first part of devotedness - sitting at His feet, hearing His word, choosing the "good part" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10">Luke  10</a>), leads to the proving of it all in His personal sympathy, so that it is not only His mind that is revealed to me, but I know how He meets me, and consoles me in a scene of death.<a name=1:10></a> Then follows the second part of devotedness, viz.<a name=1:11></a>, to resign to Christ in death that which would lend distinction to myself.<a name=1:12></a> Now unless these traits exist, there will be a defect in the character which is so pleasing to the Lord.<a name=1:13></a> I might be like Peter, who truly desired to know the mind of the Lord when he beckoned to John to ask Him who it should be who should betray Him; and afterwards so unwisely zealous that he cut off the ear of the high priest's servant.<a name=1:14></a> Here there were apparently the two parts of devotedness in

		Peter; but we see when the pressure came - when the Lord was friendless and surrounded by foes, Peter had not the stay which one who had sat at His feet would have experienced at such a moment.<a name=2:1></a> If I have chosen the "good part" - if I have sought Him for His <i>own sake</i> - I am sure to find and to know Him in my need and sorrow; for it is there I prove Him.<a name=2:2></a> Everything here loses its charm, because He is not here.<a name=2:3></a> Everything valued here is surrendered to embalm a Christ dead to this scene.<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The wind and the waves test the stability of the house, whether the foundation has been laid deep in the rock; and if the house does not stand the test, it cannot fulfil the purpose of a devoted heart.<a name=2:5></a> If I am without sympathy in my trials, I become hardened by them, like the bark of an old tree, but if I have known the sympathy of Christ which is perfect, instead of having a hard exterior, I grow a soft and beautiful moss, though my nature be as the granite rock.<a name=2:6></a> Thus there is personal evidence of real, full devotedness.<a name=2:7></a> The one wholly devoted to Christ receives so from Him, that the very vicissitudes which harden another, only make him soft and gracious.<a name=2:8></a> In my trials I prove Him; and I show my devotedness to Him by the easy way I express Him in my ways to suffering man down here.<a name=2:9></a> The moss tells me that I have received, and that I have nothing but what I have received.<a name=2:10></a> The thick bark indicates the effort to preserve something of one's own.<a name=2:11></a>

		THE HOME OF THE HEART
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What rest and satisfaction the heart finds when simply enjoying Christ!<a name=2:12></a> It is the sense of ease and rest that one feels when in the same room with a known and valued friend.<a name=2:13></a> It is not so much what passes, as the feeling of resource, and the absence of all fear or care as to any-thing around or within, like the lamb, unmoved by the approaching dog which alarms the other sheep, because it is beside its mother.<a name=2:14></a> It is the consciousness of being

	<div class="paragraph">
		under the shelter of His wing; not merely as sheltering one from what is outside, but still more as assuring one of what His love is.<a name=3:1></a> The strong quills preserve you from what is outside, but the nearer you are to Him the more you enjoy the <i>down</i>, and not merely the quills of the wing.<a name=3:2></a> This is the home - the place of rest, and of true cultivation of everything good and great.<a name=3:3></a> It is the home that really forms every one.<a name=3:4></a> The homeless one must be more or less the heartless one.<a name=3:5></a> There are homeless rich as well as homeless poor; for abundance of other things does not make up for the want of a home.<a name=3:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Home with Christ is a wondrous home; and when this is known, outdoor work of every kind really only contributes to the comfort of the home.<a name=3:7></a> The one who makes the home everything is before the heart in every labour, as the result of all the wise woman's works (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#31">Proverbs  31</a>), is that "her husband is known in the gates".<a name=3:8></a> The gleaning of Ruth is carried to the home of Naomi, and there the day's toil finds its recompense in the acceptance which it receives from Naomi.<a name=3:9></a> Thus the disciples returned and told the Lord all they had done (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#6:7">Mark  6:7</a> - 30).<a name=3:10></a> Toiling without a home may have large results, but there is never heart-enjoyment in connection with them.<a name=3:11></a> The results are satisfaction, like gold to the miser but there is not the increase of friendship with Christ, which they, if simply referred to Him, would produce.<a name=3:12></a> It makes a great difference whether I am toiling for the gain - the mere results of toil - or in order that the fruits of it may contribute to His pleasure in whom is the home and rest of my heart.<a name=3:13></a> In the latter case the results are not my object, but are like fragrant and rare flowers, adding to the charm of the home, and sweeter there than they could be anywhere else.<a name=3:14></a> There, as with Ruth in the house of Naomi, the fruit of the day's toil is really enjoyed.<a name=3:15></a> There was suffering in acquiring it, but there is enjoyment from it, when at home with Naomi.<a name=3:16></a> But more than this, the character is formed by the home; the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		miser thinks and talks of his gold; the homeless toiler or gleaner thinks only of the result of his day's work.<a name=4:1></a> But the one with a home finds how his heart is increasingly bound up in the sphere where it has rest, as he contributes in any way to please Him who makes it a home.<a name=4:2></a> And thus the heart is drawn out, because it finds its own proper food in the very love it clings to.<a name=4:3></a> Love feeds on love, and as it toils for it, it finds its reward in that for which it toils.<a name=4:4></a> All the exercises of the heart are at home, as all the exercises of the hand are abroad; and the heart imparts a character to the hand which can only be returned by the hand, in the improved nature of its work.<a name=4:5></a> The heart must have a hand, though there may be a hand without a heart.<a name=4:6></a> The heart can only be taught by a heart, and the hand derives its exquisite touches from the heart.<a name=4:7></a> The heart learns in the home, and the hand goes out from it to act for the heart; hence, the more you are in your proper home the larger will be your heart, and the better will your hand do whatever it findeth to do.<a name=4:8></a> But go from the home, as the bee from the hive, and all you gather, gather it with purpose to carry it back from every flower to the hive - the home of your heart; and thus you will grow in deeper rest and at-homedness with Him who makes every place where He is a blessed home to your heart.<a name=4:9></a>

		PROGRESS IS ALWAYS CHRISTWARD
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Every progress or growth is followed by some peculiar trial, and the extent of the growth is tested by it.<a name=4:10></a> It is not that the progress is annulled, but one is made sensible how entirely it is apart from nature.<a name=4:11></a> The trial may floor one, and one may appear for the time vanquished, and the progress may seem to have vanished; but after a time one is found to be as the teil-tree, whose substance is in it.<a name=4:12></a> The tree which had been cut down and left to every eye without a branch, sprouts again
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		with all the vigour of old and strong roots.<a name=5:1></a> The time of growth is bright and pleasant, it is summer time; but then winter ensues, and the leaves all disappear, and for a time there is no progress, at least apparently.<a name=5:2></a> The trial may be something painful, or it may be something attractive which addresses one's nature.<a name=5:3></a> When it is painful, one seeks if possible to get out of it; but the trial which thoroughly tests us, is the one which addresses our nature, as the green fields addressed Lot's nature: or as the Babylonish garment did Achan's; or as Delilah Samson's, and so on.<a name=5:4></a> The question of natural right comes in, and one asserts it, and thus one loses the path of faith, which rests on God only.<a name=5:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the reason why this kind of trial is not more felt is that the conscience is not troubled; - the sense of standing on my natural rights saves my conscience from disquietude.<a name=5:6></a> Lot might have urged that he had a right to choose any part of the land.<a name=5:7></a> My natural conscience would be troubled if right were not on my side; but it will back me in the assertion of my right to gratify my lawful desires, and thus it balks and hinders me from seeing how I am drawn aside into nature; and my progress in Christ is checked.<a name=5:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Progress is always Christward</i>.<a name=5:9></a> The moment I stand for my own rights or the gratification of the most lawful tastes - - for instance, affection or ambition - that moment I am turned aside from Christ, and my progress must be stayed, because I have become occupied, however amiably, with the man on which the cross must come.<a name=5:10></a> You may say this is hard - so did the young ruler, and "he .<a name=5:11></a>.<a name=5:12></a>.<a name=5:13></a> went away grieved", (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#10">Mark  10</a>).<a name=5:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now mark the order and manner of restoration.<a name=5:15></a> First, one begins to feel, like Lot, that one's ambition has not conduced to one's happiness; his righteous soul was vexed.<a name=5:16></a> What his conscience could sanction as right has brought him into very unhappy associations.<a name=5:17></a> Next, he suffers with his new companions, and, finally, he loses all his goods and escapes with his life.<a name=5:18></a> Samson

		loses his eyesight and is imprisoned; Achan is stoned and perishes with all that he had.<a name=6:1></a> When there is real truth of heart there will be restoration, though the tree may have appeared withered, after suffering grievously in every way, and the end is, one rejoices in parting company with one's self.<a name=6:2></a> Accepting the place of death, we turn to Christ, like Jonah in the bottom of the sea - the whale's belly; and then there is full restoration.<a name=6:3></a> Self has been discovered and judged; growth in Christ recommences; and a dreary winter is succeeded by a very prosperous and luxuriant spring-time.<a name=6:4></a>

	<div class="heading">
		POSITION WITHOUT POWER
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first difficulty in educating a soul, is to get it to accept its position in Christ, from mere knowledge of forgiveness upward; but after that position has been seen, if it be regarded merely as a title of nobility, there will not be practical power in keeping with the great title.<a name=6:5></a> The man is ennobled, but he has no property to support his rank.<a name=6:6></a> This is too often the case with saints in the present day.<a name=6:7></a> They can talk of their rank in Christ, as some in another day could say, "We have Abraham for our father" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#3:9">Matthew  3:9</a>), our title and nobility are indisputable; but the poverty is so great that it seems to be almost an appendage of nobility.<a name=6:8></a> There are many poor nobles now; and there is no question as to their right to be ennobled; the patent of the title is perfectly genuine; but the reason why there is not power or property to support the rank is that these ennobled ones are not dependent ones.<a name=6:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If I have been lifted by the hand of another to a high position, I am dependent on that hand for everything, and if I am as powerless as a child myself, it is plain, if I do not depend on the hand that exalted me, I must fall from my position from sheer inability to retain it.<a name=6:10></a> I may assert that I am entitled to it, because I have been elevated through the grace of the Lord;

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		but my support depends on and flows only from the same source and hand that elevated me.<a name=7:1></a> The fact is, the greater my elevation, if I have a true sense of the grace and the goodness of Him who elevated me, the more do I depend on Him who has done it: and thus, if the dependence increases, the higher the position, the more abundant will be the power to sustain it.<a name=7:2></a> Title to position, without dependence, is poverty.<a name=7:3></a> A person of high title in poverty is a very sad spectacle.<a name=7:4></a> I am not only through grace a king, but I am, because a son, privileged to draw everything from Him who is my life and my portion.<a name=7:5></a> Dependence always ensures property; and you will find some christians who have a little property because they are dependent, though they are ignorant of their title, and have no consciousness of their high rank.<a name=7:6></a> I do not defend that.<a name=7:7></a> If they knew the grace of God, they would know that they are ennobled; but it is better to be a rich commoner than a poor noble.<a name=7:8></a> There is a general acceptance of our divine rank now among saints.<a name=7:9></a> The knowledge of high position is very attractive, when the conscience does not feel that there is any exaction from the knowledge of it.<a name=7:10></a> Alas!<a name=7:11></a> many a well-to-do commoner who daily drew his income from his Lord, has lost his means since he found out that he was a nobleman, because he has held it in theory and lost his dependence.<a name=7:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Israel in the wilderness were commoners, but because of a measure of dependence, they were not poor.<a name=7:13></a> In the land they were nobles, and they soon became very poor, because they were not dependent.<a name=7:14></a> The church of Ephesus (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2:1">Revelation  2:1</a>), was of the highest rank, and had large property, but she gave up dependence, and with all her titles, she became poor indeed.<a name=7:15></a> If saints are dependent on God, they support their rank in Christ; but if not, however assured of their nobility, they can do nothing noble.<a name=7:16></a> They are destitute of all divine resources.<a name=7:17></a> Among men nothing is more despicable than a great noble able to do nothing in any way worthy

		of his high position.<a name=8:1></a> Thus it is too often nowadays with christians well taught in truth, who in their lives set forth nothing of the heavenly kingdom; and all because they are holding title without dependence.<a name=8:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord give us to be daily more dependent on Him, drawing supplies from Him, so that everything worthy of our rank may be maintained and expressed.<a name=8:3></a> I should rather prove that I was a noble by my ways and acts, than be acknowledged as one by title, and yet be found deficient in true nobility.<a name=8:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		THE POWER TO ACQUIRE THE WAYS OF CHRIST HERE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Scriptures present to us the truth of God, and that truth demonstrated in living ways by the Son of God on earth.<a name=8:5></a> He is the truth because He has fully set forth the mind and ways of God, in contrast to all the evil and opposition here.<a name=8:6></a> Truth has been fully expressed by Him.<a name=8:7></a> He has shewn what is contrary to God, by presenting in Himself what is worthy of God.<a name=8:8></a> The Light has come, and darkness is manifested.<a name=8:9></a> It is not a mere demonstration of the wrong, but an exposure of it in the light of that which is fully right; the evil is shewn, but it is shewn in contrast with the good.<a name=8:10></a> Thus grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.<a name=8:11></a> In the perfection of His ways, He set forth everything in its true state; what God is and what man is to God.<a name=8:12></a> The divine perfection manifested in Him exposed the true state of man with reference to God.<a name=8:13></a> The will of God was the rule of His life, and as He followed it, He observed a path peculiar to it; hence, that path judged and exposed ever one and everything not in it.<a name=8:14></a> He was not scrutinising the course of things here to hit on some line of action, which He could observe; He looked not at things here, but to God, and He walked in them according to His will.<a name=8:15></a> He walked independently of everything here.<a name=8:16></a> What God would have Him do, be it subjection to His

		parents, or anything else, entirely and simply ruled Him; and this definite reference to God in everything necessarily led Him into a new and hitherto unknown line here, where every man acted for himself.<a name=9:1></a> Christ acting in the midst of evil and contrariety here in this singular and perfect way, described the path well-pleasing to God; and hence He exposed the course which man had followed; and thus the true and false were brought into juxtaposition; the truth was manifested, and with it the grace also.<a name=9:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now it is clear that the path of Christ is our path.<a name=9:3></a> He is our life; and as we see where and how He walked, we are in our consciences assured that the only way for us is to walk even as He walked.<a name=9:4></a> When we read of Him, when we trace His way here, we are convinced that is the only course for us - the only true way, and that all the rest has been exposed by Him as false and not of God; and "we know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in the wicked one" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:19">1 John  5:19</a>).<a name=9:5></a> But conviction that such a course should be mine because it is Christ's, does not give me power to observe it and to walk in it.<a name=9:6></a> It is one thing for my conscience to be awakened to the path and ways of Christ, but it is another thing to get power to pursue and carry out what I plainly see enjoined on me as Christ's, and as the fruits of His life; and the latter (the power of life) is not acquired by seeing what flows from the possession of it, but by abiding in Christ who is my life.<a name=9:7></a> If I abide in Him, He abides in me, and I bring forth much fruit.<a name=9:8></a> I see in the word the ways and the manner of Christ; I am convinced in my conscience that these are the ways and manners which only become me; but the sense of duty is not the power to perform a duty: the power is only acquired by abiding in Christ - being occupied with Him where He is.<a name=9:9></a> The conscience being arrested is not power, though it produces zeal for what one feels is the only true thing; hence, if I put away conscience, concerning faith I make shipwreck, and if the truth

		Christ's ways may be admired and coveted without there being a distinct sense that they are the very ways that I am in truth to walk in.<a name=10:2></a> When I have this sense my conscience is awakened; and then, as I know from whence my strength comes, I seek it, that I may accomplish what is plainly the duty of my life.<a name=10:3></a> I do not look at the duties merely, but I look to Him from whence I derive power to fulfil them.<a name=10:4></a> The parent bird is never satisfied until the offspring flies and sings like herself; nor does she ever surrender this, the climax and reward too for all her toil and labour; and if the offspring had sense, it would understand the mind and intention of its parent.<a name=10:5></a> But the parent does not merely keep before her the grand consummation and reward of all her toil, when her offspring will display itself in its own nature and ability, but she feeds it with suited food, to increase the constitutional vigour, so that the desired end may be obtained; and as it approaches, when the wings have grown, her attentions are still greater, in order to direct the acquired power into the manner and ways which are in accordance with her own nature and ability.<a name=10:6></a> To live Christ is the consummation for me here; but I must <i>feed</i> on Christ in order to acquire constitutional vigour, before I can walk as He walked, which in His life I am called to and enabled for, through the power of the Spirit.<a name=10:7></a>

		The difference between learning sin in God's presence and by falling into it is very great.<a name=10:8></a> One may feel sin very deeply, because one has committed it, but this never gives one God's sense of what sin is.<a name=10:9></a> The cross of Christ is the measure of sin in the sight of God.<a name=10:10></a> Be it great or small sin, as man would speak, that is the distance in which all sin is from Him; and in that

		But all this is only viewing sin as it affects ourselves.<a name=11:6></a> And this is not the true measure of it.<a name=11:7></a> I must see how it is viewed by God.<a name=11:8></a> The terrible distance from God in which sin places one is only learned in the cross.<a name=11:9></a> I can never see what sin is but there; and if I see it there, though I may never have committed any of it, to the knowledge of my conscience, yet I see that the working of the law in my members is of that sin, which is judged in the cross, and there only is its measure meted out according to God.<a name=11:10></a> Then I get a sense of sin which no amount of personal failure could ever give me.<a name=11:11></a> There is no excusing it; no toleration of it.<a name=11:12></a> The cross is God's measure of every bit of it, the least as well as the greatest; and as I see this, I can allow no less a measure of it than His, and I shrink in holiness of nature from the least, as much as I should from the greatest, though the latter would make my conscience more sensible of my personal criminality and of consequent judgment on it here.<a name=11:13></a> As a rule, you will find that those who have committed most sins, have not the deepest sense of sin.<a name=11:14></a> They generally have a deep sense of being forgiven, and they occupy themselves with it.<a name=11:15></a> Those who have been preserved, though greatly tempted, while fearful of danger, have not only a deeper sense of the grace of God, but also a greater horror of that from which they have escaped; and the

		Satan's aim is to hinder souls from finding and enjoying that nearness to Christ which would so establish them in the taste and ways and manners of Himself, that they would find everything of man irksome, and only affording an opportunity to express the qualities of that blessed One whose spirit they have imbibed.<a name=15:1></a> I am struck in observing how saints delight in listening too to details of His love, who know very little what it is to be taught by His presence, the manners, as I may say, suited to His presence.<a name=15:2></a> One might greatly enjoy reading of the acts and purposes of a great sovereign, or a great benefactor, and yet know little or nothing of the habits and ways which would suit such a one; and possibly one might find it irksome to be obliged to submit to the peculiar influence which the presence of a great one exercises.<a name=15:3></a> The effect of the presence of Christ is piety and godliness - subduedness of heart and mind to the One whose presence is in full sway.<a name=15:4></a> When I am reading of or listening to the living acts of the Lord, I necessarily see, as I accept them in faith, that I am an object to Him; but when I am in His company, He only is before me, and as I enjoy His company, I am <i>formed</i> by the influence of that company, into the same order of things as Himself, so that I am not only influenced, but I am changed into the same image from glory to glory.<a name=15:5></a> Working for Him, reading, even praying, can be carried on without the sense of His presence.<a name=15:6></a> There may not be in any of these the sense of One so fully and entirely occupying the vision of the soul that not only must all of one's <i>evil</i> be in abeyance, but <i>self</i> is ignored, while at the same time there is a real acquisition of new habits and powers which so displace the old ones, that there is growth.<a name=15:7></a> Now I find many who, after all their reading and learning, are not thoroughly satisfied that they are objects of His

		STAGES OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are three stages in the life of a bird, which very closely illustrate those of the christian's life.<a name=136:4></a> At first the little bird only opens its mouth to receive the suited food.<a name=136:5></a> Feeding is its one simple occupation.<a name=136:6></a> As it thrives, its feathers and wings grow, and as soon as they are fully grown and used another stage of life is entered on - it flies, and then it sings.<a name=136:7></a> These three things characterise it.<a name=136:8></a> First, acquiring food for itself; the second, acquiring a new motion, which is flying; and then singing.<a name=136:9></a> Now it is evident that the second stage cannot be reached unless the first has been enjoyed.<a name=136:10></a> Food has been so supplied and appropriated that the wings have grown and been used.<a name=136:11></a> The christian first desires the sincere milk of the word that he may grow thereby, and as he grows, he is conscious of a new power, the power to fly.<a name=136:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When you fly you enter on the second stage.<a name=136:13></a> Then you acquire for yourself, you can discriminate.<a name=136:14></a> "He that is spiritual judgeth all things" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:15">1 Corinthians  2:15</a>).<a name=136:15></a> Before, some one else had to discriminate for you.<a name=136:16></a> Now you can provide for yourself suitably.<a name=136:17></a> Flying is now your natural motion, you always move above the earth; you seek the things above, you set your mind on things above, and not on things on the earth.<a name=136:18></a> This new power is always heavenward.<a name=136:19></a> "Being full of the Holy Spirit, having fixed his eyes on heaven, he saw the glory of God, and Jesus" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7:55">Acts  7:55</a>).<a name=136:20></a> And <i>then</i> comes the singing.<a name=136:21></a> I believe that no bird sings till it can fly.<a name=136:22></a> I am sure that no christian sings his true note until he can rise up in the power of the Spirit of God to Christ, where Christ is.<a name=136:23></a> This stage then is when the senses are exercised to discern good and evil, and there is known power in the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now comes the third and last stage in the life of a bird, which is building a nest and caring for her young.<a name=137:2></a> Her history began in a nest, and now she builds one and nurses a young brood.<a name=137:3></a> She brings forth much fruit.<a name=137:4></a> But this is the stage of a full-grown bird, and it illustrates the christian, who having found everything in Christ for himself, can now in true devotedness of heart serve Christ - be His disciple in this scene, and be a blessing to others.<a name=137:5></a> "If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#13:17">John  13:17</a>).<a name=137:6></a> All the love and service rendered to the bird in its early days, it now renders to the objects of its care.<a name=137:7></a> As it has received so it bestows.<a name=137:8></a> It does nothing but as it has received, and this is true service.<a name=137:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this new stage demands a very peculiar manner and way, entirely different from any hitherto known.<a name=137:10></a> The bird that flies selects its own food and sings.<a name=137:11></a> It is individual - shines as a planet.<a name=137:12></a> It testifies of the goodness and favour conferred.<a name=137:13></a> It is often brilliant, but it is alone and singular.<a name=137:14></a> But when the bird builds her nest, where she may lay her young, her character and habits undergo a very marked change.<a name=137:15></a> She surrenders none of her former power, but instead of contenting herself with her peculiar personal blessing, she now devotes herself to objects outside herself, though they are part of herself - her offspring; and because of all her interest and toil about them, dear to her as her own life.<a name=137:16></a> What makes this entire and wonderful change in her is, that she shapes herself always to the good of the objects of her love.<a name=137:17></a> You have had your stage of individual blessing and enjoyment; once known, it is yours for ever; but now you must grow in another direction; you must not, when others try and oppose

	<div class="paragraph">
		In a word, instead of retiring into yourself to find with the Lord a comfort which you have lost in seeking from others, you seek for nothing from any around, and you come forth always to give.<a name=138:9></a> Until one is able to be a giver to every one and a receiver in a begging way from none, one is not safe from expectancy here; that is, there will still be a possibility of reviving links to this scene.<a name=138:10></a> But when one is so satisfied in Christ as to be free from self, and able to build a nest - seek the blessing of others - be a hawthorn tree in the dreary winter - such a sense of the superiority of Christ is acquired, that nothing here can captivate the heart; and all the trials and slights only extract more consideration for others; more of the nest; more of the scarlet berry.<a name=138:11></a> It is only when the heart is dead as to this world, and filled with Christ in heaven, that it is proof against reviving, and then it is free to be occupied with the interests of Christ here.<a name=138:12></a>

		GOD'S SUFFICIENCY LEARNED THROUGH DISCIPLINE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In our course here we have to pass through a twofold discipline; the first on ourselves, and the other on that which we value; and each has, or produces, an effect very peculiar and distinct in itself; the one is to cast me on God for <i>help</i>, the other, to cast me on Him for comfort and rest.<a name=142:1></a> In the one, it is His power rather that I turn to; in the other, it is more to abide in His rest.<a name=142:2></a> When saints are suffering because of their bodily afflictions they are taught how powerless they are.<a name=142:3></a> All flesh is as grass; there is a sense of the impotence of man when one is languishing under a painful illness, and then it is that the saint turns to God and values His <i>power</i>, because all human power is felt to be at an end, and this is a great lesson.<a name=142:4></a> Job learned it: "I know [he says] that thou canst do every thing" (<a href="../bible/Job.htm#42:2">Job  42:2</a>) - there is no power in me, all is in God.<a name=142:5></a> Now this removes the great impediment to faith; because if I am so reduced and helpless, I cannot do aught but turn to God, as Jonah did when in the bottom of the sea.<a name=142:6></a> "Twice [it needs to be repeated] have I heard this; that power belongeth unto God" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#62:11">Psalm  62:11</a>).<a name=142:7></a> This is the great groundwork of dependence; it is the only ground the widow can take in going to the unjust judge (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#18">Luke  18</a>); he had power, she had none.<a name=142:8></a> The pressure on her was so complete that she was driven to appeal to the only one that had power, though he was otherwise most repulsive.<a name=142:9></a>

		In <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4">Ephesians  4</a>there are two edifications spoken of; one (verse 12), connected with the gifts from the Head in heaven; persons are gifted by Him to minister, and through their ministry there is an edifying of the body of Christ; but besides this, there is (verse 16), "that which every joint supplieth .<a name=147:4></a>.<a name=147:5></a>.<a name=147:6></a> maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love".<a name=147:7></a> Thus there are two edifications; one from without, and the other from within; one through something imparted, the other from the condition produced by what has been imparted.<a name=147:8></a> It is the difference between food with air, and constitutional vigour.<a name=147:9></a> Food with air is necessary to health and contributes to it, but this is quite distinct from health.<a name=147:10></a> The healthier a person is, the more he gains from the best food and air, but the action of health in itself is quite different from the action of food and air.<a name=147:11></a> Food and air symbolise the ministry.<a name=147:12></a> It is the Lord's blessed way of feeding and refreshing His own on earth; but if the ministry has been effectual, there is another way in which increase or edification is promoted, and that is by the health which the ministry has produced.<a name=147:13></a> The using of the health is that edification "which every joint supplieth".<a name=147:14></a> Invalids are dependent on food and air for mere existence.<a name=147:15></a> They know nothing of the energy of health.<a name=147:16></a> Thus is it in some places with the saints, they are too much like invalids, they are dependent on ministry for existence, or at least for the sense of it.<a name=147:17></a> If they had health they would exercise the energy in every joint, and there would be edification of the body in itself in the highest expression of health,

		HOW TO STUDY CHRIST
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In order to study Christ two things are necessary: first, the eye must be on Him in spirit, and secondly, the ear must be open to and occupied with His word, the gospel narrative especially.<a name=179:6></a> The gospels are the foundation of the testimony to Him, as He said to the twelve, "Ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#15:27">John  15:27</a>).<a name=179:7></a> It will not do to have the ear open to the word, or the account of our Lord's ways and mind on earth, unless we have our eyes fixed on Him where He is.<a name=179:8></a> There is no union but with the ascended Christ, and your power here flows from your being united to Him there.<a name=179:9></a> And unless this sense of union be preserved, you will not be in power to act.<a name=179:10></a> A child must have power to act first before you can point out to it what course or manner it should adopt.<a name=179:11></a> Now if you only have the receptive ear as to what you are to do; that is, if you are studying the gospels without having your eye on Christ above, and consequently without a fresh sense of the power of action, the consequence will be that though you will know how He

		If on the other hand the eye only is used, and the ear remains inactive; that is, if I only think of union with Him above and do not study His ways here, then, though there is a sense of power, there is no direction given to it.<a name=180:5></a> I am like a locomotive without rails; or a child with power to walk but without any instruction.<a name=180:6></a> In the one case it is knowledge of how a great many things should be done, but inability to do any of them; while in the other, it is ability to act, but entire ignorance as to how the power to act is to be employed.<a name=180:7></a> It is only in the combination of both that there can be a true study of Christ, and conformity to Him.<a name=180:8></a> The eye of the soul must be open to see Him by faith, and the ear must be open and receptive to learn of His ways and walk here.<a name=180:9></a>

		TO PREVENT LAMENESS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two educational processes which must go on simultaneously, or there will be lameness; "The legs of the lame are not equal" (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#26:7">Proverbs  26:7</a>); one is very slowly learnt, the other, very readily; but there is no real, permanent progress unless they go on together.<a name=206:1></a> One is self-mortification.<a name=206:2></a> This will be admitted as necessary by every class of christians, from the least to the greatest, and saints in general adopt it in some form or other.<a name=206:3></a> This in its full sense is extermination and not acquisition, though in most minds there is a latent thought that if the bad were mortified, the good would spring up in its place, as when an old crooked oak is cut down, a nice straight promising one springs up.<a name=206:4></a> Now this really only exposes where the lameness is, because if there be in the flesh no good thing, excision or mortification cannot improve it, or make room for an improved state; for there is nothing good in it.<a name=206:5></a> Hence, this it is that shews how necessary it is in order to prevent lameness, that one should know where advancement or growth can be acquired, and this is the other leg.<a name=206:6></a> It is by beholding Christ in glory that the new man is increased, "transformed according to the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Lord the Spirit" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#3:18">2 Corinthians  3:18</a>).<a name=206:7></a> Now it is more difficult to lead souls to see and to obtain this second leg, than the first, and yet the imperfect way they obtain the first hinders them from seeking the other, or really being able to use the one which they assume to have.<a name=206:8></a>

		His satisfaction is proved in the resurrection of Christ, and I trust in it, and not in the satisfaction of my own conscience about my sins; and then and there I have peace with God.<a name=215:2></a> This is one state; and if this state be not preserved, there will be no surmounting the pressure of nature, or the general atmosphere around.<a name=215:3></a> In this state you are like the cedar tree, with nature and purpose to rise in height above everything: its course is always upward, for in that direction is its growth.<a name=215:4></a> The heart at peace with God always finds that its course is upward, and its retreat and home above, and to this end all its strength and energy tend; and unless you are strong and matured in peace with God, you will not be able to seek His peace in your circumstances, which is the other state.<a name=215:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe that the Lord in a very peculiar way makes up to one for the privation of not assembling together, when it has been caused by circumstances beyond our control; still it is a privation.<a name=216:8></a> I think there is an evident distinction between being hindered by the chastening of the Lord, or by the power of the world.<a name=216:9></a> It is distinct mercy when one is not hindered; but when one is hindered, either by chastening or by an adverse power, there is an exercise of soul and heart accordingly.<a name=216:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		If it be by chastening, the word, as we hear it, is directed to the removal or washing away of that in us which required it.<a name=216:11></a> If it be by the power of the world, the Lord manifests Himself, and encourages and consoles us by His presence.<a name=216:12></a> This latter is properly isolation - the only good isolation, and the Lord turns it to the best account.<a name=216:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul in prison, and John at Patmos, are both isolated by the power of man; but the place and time of isolation were used of God to impart to them the deepest purposes of His mind, and I doubt not the nature of the isolation, indicated the line of truth which was committed to each.<a name=217:1></a> One was an exile; the other, a prisoner; and neither of them could by any means escape from the isolation to which they were subjected.<a name=217:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another isolation still more painful, and one which was experienced by the apostle Paul before the Roman tribunal, as he says, "all men [meaning saints] forsook me" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#4:16">2 Timothy  4:16</a>).<a name=217:3></a> They left him to shift for himself.<a name=217:4></a> It was dangerous to be identified with him; but he adds, "The Lord stood with me".<a name=217:5></a> Now this proves that if the isolation is imposed on one, the Lord does make up for it in a very distinct way by His own presence.<a name=217:6></a> But I could not call it imposed if I could free myself.<a name=217:7></a> Daniel thrown into the lions' den is an isolation that is imposed, for he could not escape from it, and the Lord is peculiarly with him; he would have preferred Jerusalem, but he could not get there, and hence in the lions' den he is better off than if he were at Jerusalem.<a name=217:8></a>

		Nothing but the Lord's chastening, or coercion from man, ought ever to induce me to abstain from the circle of divine blessing on earth.<a name=217:9></a> But if the isolation be imposed either way, I believe that the lessons taught then are most peculiar, and not the mere lessons, but the manner and way of His love and interest as never known otherwise.<a name=217:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		An isolation where no one around is of a like mind, as a child in a worldly family, I consider imposed; and according as it is really and truly accepted, the Lord manifests Himself; and then it is that the heart studies, and learns His features, as you see with the bride in Canticles.<a name=218:5></a> It learns to have but the one study, and the more it studies the more it is interested in the study.<a name=218:6></a> "The eye is not satisfied with seeing" (<a href="../bible/Ecclesiastes.htm#1:8">Ecclesiastes  1:8</a>).<a name=218:7></a> You are in a picture gallery, hung from ceiling to floor on every side with portraits of the one person; but in different circumstances and different aspects; all private, only visible to yourself, only belonging to you in isolation, and the compensation for it; never to make you indifferent to your liberty, but on the contrary to fit you for using it to more advantage when it is given to you.<a name=218:8></a>

		When in isolation through coercion, over which I have no control, there is a time of special blessing.<a name=218:9></a> Duties may be of this order of coercion.<a name=218:10></a> I think solitude most necessary and profitable, and as there must be rest in sleep for the body or the mind which is much exercised, so there must be much meditation in solitude, for the one much occupied in acquiring.<a name=218:11></a> Where the acquiring is small, the retirement can be small.<a name=218:12></a> There is little to ruminate on, when there has been little taken in.<a name=218:13></a> To be a clean animal there was to be both the chewing of the cud, and dividing of the hoof; there must be rumination after feeding, and feet to practise.<a name=218:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Of course the first thing is prowess or heart, emboldening one to enter the lists.<a name=219:6></a> The racer must have the mettle, it must be his nature to run, and without this quality, this mettle, that is, heart or faith, there is no use entering the field, for without it there can be no prospect of success.<a name=219:7></a> There must first be the intrepid steed or the spirited wrestler.<a name=219:8></a> Without mettle you are neither a racer nor a wrestler.<a name=219:9></a> It is this that makes the difference between a waggon horse and a racehorse or courser.<a name=219:10></a> The latter has nerve or liking for the race.<a name=219:11></a> Without this there is no use attempting to run or wrestle.<a name=219:12></a> But after you are assured of the inherent abilities of the courser, and are convinced of his endurance, there is another thing, and that is the <i>training</i> - the readiness and skill to obey and observe every rule.<a name=219:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		second power, to apply what is so valuable at the given time, and on the needed occasion, and if many a one cannot enter on the race because he has not the step or the heart to run; if it be sad to see how few are able to enter the lists, it is still more sad to see one with much ability forfeiting everything because unable to apply the strength to the tests of the race-course.<a name=220:1></a> If a horse can jump a wall five feet high, but will balk and sulk at a common country fence, his strength and ability are all forfeited, because he will cower at common things, and yet prove his powers in brilliant performances not so common.<a name=220:2></a> Just so with the saint; it is not enough to be endowed with the best qualities: of course if one is not, there can be no ability to take the lead; but unless these qualities do duty in the daily wear and tear of life, there is not a striving lawfully, according to what is consistent with God's order; anything else is illegal.<a name=220:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the saint is not only to have the qualities for the race or the conflict, but he must by habit or training have his powers so in hand, that he refuses nothing.<a name=220:4></a> He is as ready to prove his strength in connection with the commonest detail of daily life, because it is "lawful", as with something which makes a more singular impression.<a name=220:5></a> In a word, to "strive lawfully" one must not shy at or decline a single trial of strength set in our course; because in the race, failing at any of the trials, or avoiding anything which is in the course, is departing from it; and then there is no crowning, no reaching the summit; and not only this, but one is thrown back, hindered, and grieved at failure, and there is far more suffering on account of failure than there would have been if the test were submitted to with the grace possessed.<a name=220:6></a>

		GUIDANCE (1)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I feel that in matters for which you seek guidance, it is not so much praying for direction that one needs as getting near the Lord; and the nearer you are to Him, the clearer will everything appear; for you will remark that the thing most on your mind is the one most subjected to the test at such a time; and the proof of your reality is the way you stand clear of it; so that you can look at it, not as one under the power of it, but as one so satisfied with the Lord that you are able to accept His counsel, whatever it be.<a name=226:5></a> When we ask for guidance about a matter in which we are too much engrossed, or which is in a way necessary to us, we are not free enough to receive His mind.<a name=226:6></a> The heart is like a sheet of paper, all written over with our own desires.<a name=226:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nothing is really necessary for us but Christ; and when we are simply happy in Him, we are ready for any counsel which He may give us.<a name=226:8></a> He orders for us here in the wilderness, because it is a wilderness, and we are needy in it; but we best understand His orders when we are first satisfied in His fulness.<a name=226:9></a> When I am very happy in Him, outside of what I need here, I am sure, as I walk in faith, to be kept from what would be a hindrance to my communion with Him, because I am in the fresh sense of what He is, and therefore quickly alive to what is not suited to Him.<a name=226:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think the only way of truly judging about anything simply natural is, whether it causes any reserve between the Lord and me; and it is evident that it is only in proportion as I know and cultivate nearness to Him

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The great end and value of waiting on the Lord is to ascertain His mind, and when I have learned it, to act upon it.<a name=227:3></a> If, after I have ascertained His mind, I do not act on it, I lose the certainty of His mind, and make myself a centre, instead of walking in the path marked out for me.<a name=227:4></a> I make my knowledge merely contemplative, and not practical, and my own health of soul suffers.<a name=227:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Coincidences buoy up the natural mind, and we must take care that they do not supersede faith, though they may sometimes confirm faith.<a name=227:6></a> The Lord bless and keep you learning how to abound, and how to be abased; the former is the harder of the two.<a name=227:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		GUIDANCE (2)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to guidance, the first thing to settle is the direction or line in which you wish to be guided.<a name=227:8></a> Is it for prosperity and happiness here, or is it in Christ's path, however suffering that may be?<a name=227:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Generally guidance is sought for one's own advantage.<a name=227:10></a> I do not doubt the Lord helps the waiting soul that does not rise higher, but this is guidance simply for one's own gain.<a name=227:11></a> I consider guidance to be for the Lord's sake, when He leads me as His servant, and this I can only arrive at by acting as He would act were He in my place and circumstances.<a name=227:12></a> Of course, if I <i>knew</i> how He would act were He in my place, all would be settled.<a name=227:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The real difficulty, then, is to find out how He would act, and this can only be acquired by acquaintance with His mind.<a name=227:14></a> The word, in a very distinct way, informs me of His mind; not with reference to some particular instance merely, but what His mind is.<a name=227:15></a> It is not so much, for example, what you could make of an oak-tree, but what an oak-tree in its qualities <i>is</i>.<a name=227:16></a> I get

		formed in His mind by intelligent study of the word; but it is not simply knowledge, but the mind of the Lord, which is unfolded in the Bible.<a name=228:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Many read the Bible, and are well informed in textual meanings, who have not acquired the mind of the Lord - that is, how He would act or feel in a given case.<a name=228:2></a> Now, if I do not know the Lord's relation, in His own mind, to everything here, I shall study the word ineffectually as to guidance; because I am studying it with reference to a relation which is not correct at the present time.<a name=228:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If I had to act for a king rejected, I should not be guided, were I to act for him as if he were reigning.<a name=228:4></a> Plainly, if you do not see Christ's present relation to this scene, supposing you go back to Jesus on the earth, sent to be the Lamb of God, which is as much as the best in systems see, how could you have guidance now according to His mind?<a name=228:5></a> If you are truly seeking to act as He would act, you are seeking Him in quite a different relation from that in which He is now; and every step you take for the Lord, even when sanctioned by the word, betrays this great defect - namely, that you are trying to act like Him in a relation to present things which was once true, but is not now; and then you would use the sword, like David, or great earthly pomp, like Solomon.<a name=228:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus there are three things necessary for guidance: first, that you are obedient, prepared in heart to act as He would act; secondly, that you understand His present relation to things here; thirdly, that you acquire His mind from the word as a whole; for it is the knowledge of His mind that imparts colour and beauty, like His, to our ways.<a name=228:7></a>

		and He is with them.<a name=229:1></a> The circumstances are just the suited ones for exercising their souls, and leading them into the rest which faith gives, when it sees no one to lean on, and the resource is only in God.<a name=229:2></a> They, like ourselves, do not understand the lesson which the Lord would teach them; and they reason among themselves, saying, "It is because we have no bread".<a name=229:3></a> With us, whether in our private circumstances, or in the church, when we are placed in circumstances where there are no visible resources, the first and great thing which hinders our blessing, and occupies our minds, is the attempt to account for this warning which we do not understand, by blaming ourselves for our want of prudence and foresight.<a name=229:4></a> The tendency is to be occupied with the failure or the want, rather than with Him who, in His mercy, is present, to keep and to satisfy our hearts in Himself, when there are no resources.<a name=229:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here they are, in the ship, in the sea, without bread; no circumstances could be more resourceless, but He was with them, and He, they have now to learn, was sufficient.<a name=229:6></a> This is the large place, the resurrection-ground, the continent of blessing, which gladdened a Simeon, when he had the child Jesus in his arms.<a name=229:7></a> It was the shore on which the dying thief landed.<a name=229:8></a> It was that spot which Paul knew was "far better" than any here, that unknown land that in spirit every one now must enter on, whether on a death-bed, or in spirit crossing the Jordan.<a name=229:9></a> It is, in fact, the landing-place; and this is the first lesson of resurrection life, for it is the soul finding out that it has nothing but Christ, and what He - blessed be His name - is in His sufficiency.<a name=229:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before we reach this, we may be like the disciples, truly loving Him, and knowing Him as our Saviour; but we have not yet stood outside everything, and found that He is enough for us when there is nothing else.<a name=229:11></a> But not only this (for this is only the beginning), we find here how fully He satisfies the heart, and makes up for everything.<a name=229:12></a>

		If Simeon, or a dying thief, or the martyr Stephen, find Him everything to them, why should <i>we</i> wait for the dissolution of the body, and of all here, to learn this full and blessed lesson?<a name=230:1></a> Surely Paul did not wait for it till death; but in order to learn it, the teaching figuratively set forth here is necessary.<a name=230:2></a> We shrink from being in the ship at sea, with nothing in it but Christ; and yet it is then we learn for the first time His full value.<a name=230:3></a> The mercies of a former day tell us who He is, and He recalls them to His disciples, in order that they may understand <i>who</i> He is; but He Himself is greater than His mercies; and when we have no resources, we learn <i>what</i> He is.<a name=230:4></a> I have nothing but Christ; is He sufficient, or not?<a name=230:5></a> This is resurrection, and when I have entered on it, I know the power and resources of the life of Christ.<a name=230:6></a> No soul can know consciously what Christ is, as to resource, above all the claims of nature, until it has learned this lesson.<a name=230:7></a> Abraham learned it when he ascended Mount Moriah, prepared in heart to extinguish the only light which cheered his eye on earth; and at no time did his soul enter into, or comprehend, what God is in His own might and majesty, as in that eventful moment.<a name=230:8></a> Each step in that solitary ascent only deepened his conviction of the greatness of the God in whom he trusted; and after it, he was prepared for the deeper communications from God.<a name=230:9></a> And assuredly, until we have found Christ - not only as our Saviour, saving us from the depths of our ruin and sin, but also as the One on the shore who is enough for us, where there is nothing else - we are not prepared for deeper revelations, for the unfolding of things connected with Christ, because we have not found Him to be the true resource of our hearts.<a name=230:10></a> An this, not only in our own individual history, but also in the church, and as His witnesses on earth; for, after all, there is no true standing publicly which has not been learned individually.<a name=230:11></a> If I know Christ in my private history as my resource when there is nothing

	<div class="paragraph">
		To know Him in His sufficiency, apart from everything else, is necessarily at the very beginning of our life in Him.<a name=231:3></a> He saves us, and because He lives, we live also; but the moment I know that He is my life fully, it is no longer "I, but Christ liveth in me"; and hence it is Himself who first meets me.<a name=231:4></a> He is the Head whom I am told to hold, and from whom all nourishment flows; this is what gives strength and character to the soul, and is learned and cultivated by every one who enjoys solitude with Him.<a name=231:5></a> If He is not enough for my soul alone with Him, I have not learned that He surpasses all things; nor could I bear to be deprived of everything here, nor to confront it fearlessly.<a name=231:6></a> When He is enough, retirement from everything and every one to Himself is full rest and solace to the heart; and the less question there is between Him and me, the more shall I seek to be alone with Him, because there I am prepared for explanation and correction from Him, which I should not have received or noticed in the crowd.<a name=231:7></a> If I have wandered from Him, I shall fear being alone with Him; and yet, if I have known what a resource He is to my heart alone, I shall be miserable until I have found myself again alone with Him, and have heard His correction, which restores and invigorates my soul.<a name=231:8></a> And as our souls learn this, two things are apparent in our course: one, that we can bear the loss of anything, because He is our resource; the other, that we fear not any power which may oppose us, because He is near us.<a name=231:9></a>

		THE STUDY OF SCRIPTURE: ITS EFFECT
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The greatness, goodness, and wisdom of God revealed to the soul fills it with adoration, so that everything which makes Him known to me should call out worship, whatever the occasion may be.<a name=232:1></a> You get the perfect idea of this in the book of Revelation.<a name=232:2></a> In heaven, where I am free from all self-occupation, worship bursts forth; and now, when the calmness and rest of His presence is known, even the ordinary things of life call forth worship.<a name=232:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this connection you will find that reading Scripture as a whole, as the revelation of Himself, will give you a grasp of God as He is, which will assist and lead to this worshipping sense.<a name=232:4></a> As a rule, I think Scripture should be read primarily with the thought that God is making Himself known to me.<a name=232:5></a> I ought, as I read the Scriptures, to seek to imbibe His mind, communicated to me through a spiritual medium, but in actual human scenes, which vividly present me to myself as if in them, and how God acts and judges with regard to me in them.<a name=232:6></a> I am thus learning Him in a <i>variety</i> of ways.<a name=232:7></a> In the Old Testament I find Him dealing with man as he is; feeble, and hindered by the intervention of any difficulty: sometimes with no water to drink, sometimes too much of it stopping his way.<a name=232:8></a> Satan is not so much seen there; but all creation, and man ostensibly hindering any one who is faithful to God on the earth.<a name=232:9></a> God shows His own that He is above circumstances, and how He does this is always interesting; but not only this, it also discloses to us His own nature, so that, as we read on, we are getting to know and understand <i>Him</i>.<a name=232:10></a>

		Now Christ "ever liveth to make intercession"; this <i>never</i> is interrupted, nor does it ever cease; hence mercy flows uninterruptedly to us, even when we are walking in a careless way.<a name=251:5></a> The washing is the action of the word on myself, made known to my own heart and conscience, and which, if not made known, leaves me at a moral distance in my soul from Christ.<a name=251:6></a> Now it is not only forgiveness, or relief to my conscience, which the washing comprises or expresses, but it is more; the forgiveness is assured to me because of the intercession, and because of Jesus Christ the righteous.<a name=251:7></a> When I am washed, I am <i>cleansed;</i> all that which has caused distance is sensibly removed from me, and now, by this action, I am made conscious of being in unclouded nearness to Him.<a name=251:8></a> I require to be washed when I have no sense of sins on my conscience, as well as when I have, if there be any reserve between the Lord and me, that is, if I am out of communion.<a name=251:9></a>

		The past year is one ever to be remembered by you.<a name=292:1></a> In the hour of trial you have tasted of His life, which outlives the dissolution of everything here, imparting to you such a sense of its virtue that you, like Noah, enter anew on the earth; or, like Lazarus, you have been down to the sides of the grave, and you have come forth with this new and wonderful experience: "The Lord .<a name=292:2></a>.<a name=292:3></a>.<a name=292:4></a> bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up" (<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#2:6">1 Samuel  2:6</a>).<a name=292:5></a> This is the first experience.<a name=292:6></a> But there have been three: first, you have proved the power and tenderness of His hand on your behalf; the second follows, and is conveyed in the words of our Lord, "Loose him, and let him go" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#11:44">John  11:44</a>).<a name=292:7></a> Lazarus must be in the full, unfettered vigour of his position.<a name=292:8></a> He had experienced the favour of the Lord in bringing him up from the grave; now he must be freed from everything belonging to the grave which would hinder his full enjoyment of the favour; even as the tiny bird not only bursts the shell, and breathes freely, but ere long receives feathers and wings, to reach the shelter that suits it, or to escape the danger that threatens it - soaring in an elevation above everything of man.<a name=292:9></a>

		Your third experience is fellowship with His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, just as Lazarus "was one of them that sat at the table with him" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#12:2">John  12:2</a>).<a name=292:10></a> In this fellowship, aware of, and partaker of His elevation, the most wondrous experience ever vouchsafed to the soul here, <i>He imparts to me the virtues of His own position</i> - ascended into glory.<a name=292:11></a> Oh, the favour when the Lord takes pains with us to lead us experimentally into this fellowship, which is His own calling for us; and where only, with enraptured eye and satisfied heart, we can share in the things of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=292:12></a>

		TWO WAYS OF RELIEF FOR SORROW
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two ways of relief for the sorrowing one here: one is present nearness to Christ, where whatever the heart needs is found in Him.<a name=293:1></a> The want indicates the supply, but there must be nearness to Him for this.<a name=293:2></a> It is touching Christ that draws out the needed virtue.<a name=293:3></a> Now this mode of relief, while it places me superior to the pressure of the hour, enables me to be, though sorrowful, always rejoicing - able to serve, without being incommoded by the strait-waistcoat of circumstances here.<a name=293:4></a> There are "songs in the night".<a name=293:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The other mode of relief is the one, I apprehend, you look for, and that is the immediate coming of our Lord.<a name=293:6></a> Surely this will be the perfect relief; but I fear that you are looking at the termination of incongruities, more than seeking His present succour, so as to be like a giant refreshed with wine, making moral space for Christ in the midst of the direst opposition to Him.<a name=293:7></a> I should like to see you like a rose breaking through the dense jungle, to shed its fragrance, when there was no one, apparently, to appreciate it; made superior to the thorns and briars of the wilderness by the succour of His presence, who will speedily quash them in the day of His coming, and perpetuate to you the joy, without a check, which has sustained you in the dreariest hour here; and not simply looking for the termination of everything adverse, in the brightness and joy of a day when all shadows will be dispersed for ever.<a name=293:8></a> Is it the termination of the incongruous and sorrowful that you look for?<a name=293:9></a> or is it the present succour of Christ to be superior now, knowing that if we suffer, we shall also reign with Him?<a name=293:10></a> You are more a captive, waiting for and expecting the coming Deliverer, than the one His heart doth safely trust in, delighting in His love and succour, and thinking of the joy and welcome He will have at His return.<a name=293:11></a>

		THE WILDERNESS HISTORY
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a great thing to know where you are historically.<a name=294:1></a> The wilderness journey is to teach us two things; one is, "that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth man live" (<a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#8:3">Deuteronomy  8:3</a>).<a name=294:2></a> This is simply dependence upon God.<a name=294:3></a> The other is, "that he might .<a name=294:4></a>.<a name=294:5></a>.<a name=294:6></a> do thee good at thy latter end".<a name=294:7></a>(<a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#8:16">Deuteronomy  8:16</a>).<a name=294:8></a> Once you have arrived at the first, you will rest assured of the second.<a name=294:9></a> When we are clear out of Egypt, the trials of the wilderness begin.<a name=294:10></a> Marah is the first, the natural inability to drink the water of the Red Sea, or death; but when we accept the cross of Christ, this is easy for us; the bitter water becomes sweet; we bear about in the body the dying of Jesus.<a name=294:11></a> On this follows historically the manna, and the rock that followed them; the life of Jesus, in the present power of the Spirit.<a name=294:12></a> It is a great thing when you are thus far on the journey; though you have not overcome the adverse power, or Satan, in the wilderness, until Amalek is overthrown; and this, though carried out by Joshua, who sets forth the Spirit of Christ, was really secured by Christ gone on high, as Moses supported by Aaron and Hur.<a name=294:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now if Aaron had continued true to these experiences, they would have triumphed over the temptations of the wilderness.<a name=294:14></a> If you are daily bearing about in your body the dying of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in your body (which relates to yourself}, and on the other hand, are in assured victory over Amalek, I believe you are proof to the four great temptations of the wilderness, as set forth in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10">1 Corinthians  10</a>.<a name=294:15></a> The first - idolatry - is enjoying oneself here without God; and if the first be not checked, the second ensues, which is meretricious union or association with the world.<a name=294:16></a> On this follows loathing the manna - Christ in humiliation - as insufficient to sustain the heart here.<a name=294:17></a> Hence literature, and Jabal,

		and Jubal, and Tubal Cain's fascinations are delighted in; and, finally, the pleasant land is despised.<a name=295:1></a> I believe the one over whom Amalek prevails is one who, like Peter (though he truly loved the One he denied), is not walking in the effect of the cross on himself, and therefore without its result - the manifestation of the life of Jesus.<a name=295:2></a> Simply, if I am not practically applying the cross in which I am really crucified with Christ, I am not in a state to encounter Amalek.<a name=295:3></a> I have the two forces to overcome; first the one in myself, and then the one outside myself.<a name=295:4></a> Peter had not overcome the first, which was his self-confidence in following the Lord; and then, when the enemy desired to sift him as wheat, he found him unprepared, and the ready victim of his malice.<a name=295:5></a> His carnal confidence even in his love for his Lord made him an easy prey for the enemy.<a name=295:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		May the Lord increase more and more your love to Him; but as sure as you trust yourself, you have not learnt the life of Jesus, through His cross; and so surely will the enemy overcome you where you least expected to be overcome.<a name=295:7></a> Be careful to ensure the victory within; and then you will by the Spirit of Christ, and the effect of His intercession above, overcome Amalek; and then, as by one step, you will join Joshua again at Jordan, to cross over into present heavenly joys with the Lord.<a name=295:8></a>

		FAITH THE GIFT OF GOD

		There is always God's power with faith in God's word.<a name=349:10></a> If you believe man's word you have only the worth of what you believe, but when you believe God's word you believe in God, and this could not be but by the power of God.<a name=349:11></a> How could man reach up to God but by His power?<a name=349:12></a> "Who hath believed our report?<a name=349:13></a> and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?<a name=349:14></a>" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#53:1">Isaiah  53:1</a>).<a name=349:15></a> Faith and power go hand in hand.<a name=349:16></a> Man fell when he turned away from God in unbelief; when he pleases God it is proof that a divine light has entered his soul; he believes "that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:6">Hebrews  11:6</a>).<a name=349:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The first error in the so-called faith-healing people, is that they put sin and sicknesses on the same footing.<a name=358:1></a> They say that the work of Christ clears us of our sins, He "bare our sins in his own body on the tree" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:24">1 Peter  2:24</a>), - and that He also bare our sicknesses - that is, that He bore each alike.<a name=358:2></a> Now if this is true our sins could come back on us again; for it is evident our sicknesses come back to us again.<a name=358:3></a> Here is their first unsoundness.<a name=358:4></a> They put no difference between sins and sicknesses.<a name=358:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Next, they entirely overlook the discipline of the Lord with regard to the body.<a name=358:6></a> The body is the Lord's.<a name=358:7></a> He has washed away all our sins, but the body is His - His vessel, or channel for His service here; and He disciplines it, when it is acting in self will.<a name=358:8></a> "For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:30">1 Corinthians  11:30</a>).<a name=358:9></a> And when we are faithful, He allows us to suffer in the body, if not by persecution, by other suffering, for our profit.<a name=358:10></a> "We which live are alway delivered unto death" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:11">2 Corinthians  4:11</a>).<a name=358:11></a> Surely that is bodily pain.<a name=358:12></a>

		Faith-healing in its system professes to effect cures in every case of sickness where there is faith in the invalid, and this must be so when it is assumed that a case of illness is evidence that there is not faith there.<a name=359:3></a> Thus Timothy with a weakly body must have been, according to them, lacking in faith.<a name=359:4></a> It is clear in <a href="../bible/James.htm#5:14">James  5:14</a>, that the praying is not promiscuous, but limited to the elders, and the answer depends on their faith.<a name=359:5></a> In the matter of sin, any one can pray for his brother, unless it be a sin unto death: "I do not say that he shall pray for it" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:16">1 John  5:16</a>).<a name=359:6></a> The faith-healing system is like a board of health.<a name=359:7></a> Every one can apply; there is no exercise about each case before the Lord.<a name=359:8></a> The Lord is not the one who counsels the prayer.<a name=359:9></a> Paul thanks God that he remembers Timothy in his prayers.<a name=359:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have for some time been thinking of writing to you.<a name=421:3></a> I believe, if I may be candid with you, that the defect in your teaching has been 'the attaining process'.<a name=421:4></a> There are two ways ordinarily of advancing.<a name=421:5></a> One by assiduous pursuit, and thereby acquiring the thing desired; the other, by gift - endowment.<a name=421:6></a> The first may be illustrated by a man who makes his fortune, and rises to eminence; the other, by one who has received riches and honours by inheritance or gift.<a name=421:7></a> Now the latter is the way <i>we</i> receive everything divine, because everything is the gift of grace.<a name=421:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us examine the conditions or state produced in a saint by each of those two modes in which progress is sought.<a name=421:9></a> The one who tries to progress by assiduous pursuit is eager, earnest, full of aspiration, not satisfied with seeing.<a name=421:10></a> "Give, give", is the unceasing desire.<a name=421:11></a> Very attractive such a one would be as a listener, very interesting as a narrator of discovered truth, and of heavenly scenery.<a name=421:12></a> In manner there is a pleasing drapery of devoteeism, a captivation with Solomon's things, but with no knowledge of being united to Him, and therefore with no sense of possession.<a name=421:13></a> Hence there is no power to rend one's own clothes, and be superior to feelings or tempers in anything.<a name=421:14></a> Like a miser the joy is in acquiring, and recounting their gains, that is, their progress.<a name=421:15></a> They condemn every one not in accordance with themselves.<a name=421:16></a> They are always individual; they never have the sense that their acquisitions are in common with the body of Christ, or that all the saints are in conjunction with them.<a name=421:17></a>

		It is one thing to be silent and passive under suffering, and quite another to be conscious of its 'needs be'; and though it may be only in a very partial way at first, to derive such real good and help from it that, instead of lamenting, one is owning to the Lord His wisdom and thoughtfulness in putting one through such necessary discipline.<a name=430:6></a> Now this can never be reached but through exercise of soul.<a name=430:7></a> The trial which one feels much ought to exercise one much before God.<a name=430:8></a> If I am assured that His love is as great as His power, and knows neither measure nor end, must I not be exercised before Him as to why, in His love, He should allow me to be so afflicted?<a name=430:9></a> The very exercise engages and connects my soul with Him; and this nearness acquires for me help and instruction about many other things.<a name=430:10></a> The waiting on God in the time of affliction, or because of it, is requited with a growth and a strength in God, which tends to relieve of the suffering which was the original cause of waiting on Him; and the soul, once truly habituated to wait on Him, learns so to value it, that it never again can do without it and then it can say, "All my springs are in thee" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#87:7">Psalm  87:7</a>).<a name=430:11></a> The fact of the desolation which one feels here when a beloved one has been removed, and the reluctance with which one refuses to submit to it, proves that the heart required the trial, in order to discover to it that it had rested and hoped in something outside of God; and the exercise of soul, consequent on the affliction, leads to that nearness and waiting on Him,

	<div class="paragraph">
		<br>DEAR FELLOW-CHRISTIAN,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Is the church, the body of Christ, on the earth?<a name=518:11></a> The answer to this question is of the deepest moment to you.<a name=518:12></a> If answered in the affirmative, great indeed are your privileges and corresponding responsibility; while if answered in the negative, you would concede a sad conclusion, that the body of Christ has ceased to be on the earth.<a name=518:13></a> If the latter were true each christian would be an isolated unit, and you would be deprived of the privileges belonging to the body of Christ.<a name=518:14></a> Your admitting that His body is here places you under the gravest responsibility.<a name=518:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, let us ascertain from Scripture the origin and constitution of the church, the body of Christ.<a name=518:16></a> We read in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#16:25">Romans  16:25</a>, that the mystery was kept

		There are two ministries: the ministry of the gospel and the ministry of the church (see <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:23">Colossians  1:23</a> - 25).<a name=519:8></a> The ministry of the gospel is your salvation: until you know this you could not know the ministry of the church which is the body of Christ.<a name=519:9></a> The ministry of the gospel is, thank God, extensively known; but you may rest assured, that if every earnest preacher of the gospel knew that on the reception of the gospel of God there was to follow our highest blessing, an introduction into the christian's highest position here for Christ, he would be even more zealous that his converts should be so established in the grace of God that they might enter on their glorious relation to Christ.<a name=519:10></a> In the gospel we learn Christ's perfect work for us in bringing us to God now; while in the church, we are introduced into such close relation to Christ as members of His body,

		PRAYING IN PUBLIC

		It appears that any brother who is led by the Spirit has liberty to pray in public: "I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#2:8">1 Timothy  2:8</a>); and I believe it will always be found that the man who is becoming the most fitted to speak the word of God to man, in preaching and teaching, is the one who has first begun with God by prayer in public - that is, his public service has begun at the prayer meeting.<a name=530:7></a> I fear the man who would preach, but whose voice is never heard in prayer.<a name=530:8></a> I believe that the one most fervent at the prayer meeting, is the one who will most persuasively arrest men.<a name=530:9></a>
