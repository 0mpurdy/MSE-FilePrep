		There are two subjects in these two chapters: one is the contrast between the wilderness and Canaan; the other, the contrast between Egypt and Canaan; they are very distinct contrasts, and the teaching of the two scriptures is, how we are to retain what we reach.<a name=1:1></a> Many reach who cannot retain, because retaining a thing requires a continuance of the power by which we reached it.<a name=1:2></a> Many a person in natural things can reach a height he cannot maintain.<a name=1:3></a> A great effort, a fortunate act, may reach a great eminence, but the question is whether you can retain it.<a name=1:4></a>

		We all admit the fact that God has a place for us hereafter, but Canaan is not a future place; it is heaven on earth at the present time.<a name=1:5></a> We belong to another place altogether; we are on earth in a place that we do not belong to.<a name=1:6></a> I belong to heaven, but I am on earth, and that is Canaan.<a name=1:7></a> I am out of Egypt, and I have to learn the wilderness, and the man who is mostly in Canaan is the man who best understands what it is to be in the wilderness, for the higher you go the better you understand what it is to be dependent.<a name=1:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the history of Israel they needed the wilderness to get into Canaan, and then they left it.<a name=1:9></a> It is not so with us; you often get contrasts in this way in scripture.<a name=1:10></a> It is not that we leave the wilderness for Canaan, but that we are in the wilderness as belonging to Canaan.<a name=1:11></a> A person may say, You are not in heaven; and I answer, That is true, but I am united to One who <i>is</i> and I am nearer to that One than to any other.<a name=1:12></a> I am on the earth, but I am united to One who is in heaven; and the more I know that, the more I am in Canaan.<a name=1:13></a> Besides this, I get no support

		whatever from this earth that I am on; so it is the wilderness to me.<a name=2:1></a> And the more you advance in the knowledge that you are a heavenly man the more novel, the more distressing, the more severe, the more extraordinary, the more unaccountable, will be the trials that you are subjected to in order that you may be dependent, lest being puffed up you should lose your high position through independence or wilfulness.<a name=2:2></a>

		There are many people who are converted who are not sure that they are saved; and there are many who are saved who do not know that they are heavenly.<a name=2:3></a> But all these stand or fall together.<a name=2:4></a> As we read, "The land which the Lord thy God <i>giveth</i> thee for an inheritance" (<a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#15:4">Deuteronomy  15:4</a>); it is a <i>gift</i>.<a name=2:5></a> I am as much a heavenly man as a saved man.<a name=2:6></a> I may be a very useless British subject, but I am one all the same.<a name=2:7></a> It is a great thing to get hold of the calling: "Walk worthy of the calling wherewith ye have been called", (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:1">Ephesians  4:1</a>).<a name=2:8></a> I lay it down as a settled thing for your soul, that you must say, I am as much a heavenly man as I am a saved man.<a name=2:9></a> He has already united me to Himself there, and, when He comes, it is that He may take me to the place where He is.<a name=2:10></a> I have not got to heaven yet, but I belong to the One who is there.<a name=2:11></a>

		Man naturally never rises to this even when he is converted.<a name=2:12></a> Take, for example, the thief on the cross.<a name=2:13></a> He says, "Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#23:42">Luke  23:42</a>).<a name=2:14></a> No, says the Lord; today in paradise.<a name=2:15></a> He was to have, not the kingdom, but heaven.<a name=2:16></a> Take another case, that of Stephen.<a name=2:17></a> He looked up and saw "Jesus standing on the right hand of God", and he turns to his murderers and says.<a name=2:18></a> You are going to send me out of this place, but it is only to send me to heaven.<a name=2:19></a> Take a still further case in Paul.<a name=2:20></a> He says, "I knew a man in Christ .<a name=2:21></a>.<a name=2:22></a>.<a name=2:23></a> <i>see <a href="jbs_footnotes.htm#4:2">footnote</a></i> (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out

		It is a great thing to be able to walk about and say, I do not belong to this place at all; It is nothing but wickedness.<a name=3:3></a> Take an amiable man in nature.<a name=3:4></a> As he suffers in seeing all the disorder, misrule, cruelty, that is around him, what a relief to him to be able to say.<a name=3:5></a> My citizenship is not here; I am not responsible for it.<a name=3:6></a> My citizenship is in heaven.<a name=3:7></a> I say it is an immense thing.<a name=3:8></a> God says to me it is not my place.<a name=3:9></a> When He began with Abram, He called him out and said.<a name=3:10></a> This is not to be your country; come out of it to a land that I will show you.<a name=3:11></a> And so now God says, I do not give My people a place where My Son is rejected, but a place where He is received.<a name=3:12></a> I am a heavenly man, not by attainment, but by the gift of God.<a name=3:13></a> I am as much a heavenly man as I am a British subject, whether I am acting well or not.<a name=3:14></a>

		I turn to these two scriptures to show that no height to which grace elevates us at the present moment ever takes us out of dependence here.<a name=3:17></a> Nay, if we lose dependence, as some have done, we bring reproach on the truth we are brought into.<a name=3:18></a> What keeps us in the high position is dependence.<a name=3:19></a> A man who learns obedience without dependence is legal.<a name=3:20></a> What was the great lesson of the wilderness?<a name=3:21></a> Not simply to "humble thee", but to "make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth man live" (<a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#8:3">Deuteronomy  8:3</a>).<a name=3:22></a> That is, that you are to be dependent on the Word of God; and then you are obedient.<a name=3:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Obedience when you are looking for a rule is legal.<a name=4:1></a> Dependence is what I learn in the wilderness, and obedience is what keeps me in Canaan: but it is obedience as the consequence of being a dependent man.<a name=4:2></a>

		Look at the Lord: <i>the</i> most heavenly Man; "the Son of man who is in heaven".<a name=4:3></a> And what is He down here?<a name=4:4></a> <i>The</i> most obedient One.<a name=4:5></a> He says, I have not got a word from God, so I cannot turn the stone into bread.<a name=4:6></a> I have learned to be a dependent Man, and because I am a dependent Man therefore I am an obedient Man.<a name=4:7></a> I live "by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God".<a name=4:8></a> That is the place of a heavenly man upon earth.<a name=4:9></a>

		It is then in proportion as you enjoy the land that there will be trials in the wilderness.<a name=4:10></a> So much so, that even Peter, who does not get out of the wilderness at all, says: "Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#4:12">1 Peter  4:12</a>).<a name=4:11></a> I am passing through the wilderness; and the only thing I have to keep my eye on here, as Peter says, is the enemy of God.<a name=4:12></a> Peter, as we have seen, never puts you out of the wilderness.<a name=4:13></a> John is the first who puts you out of it; and he does not put you in heaven -- only gives you a heavenly life on earth.<a name=4:14></a> "Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour".<a name=4:15></a> (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#5:8">1 Peter  5:8</a>) I have different enemies - three great ones, at any rate.<a name=4:16></a> There is Pharaoh; that is the clutch, the grasp, of the world.<a name=4:17></a> There is Amalek; that is the power of Satan to hinder.<a name=4:18></a> And there is Balaam; that is the snare of socialism.<a name=4:19></a> And these you do not, get in Canaan at all.<a name=4:20></a>

		In <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#12">2 Corinthians  12</a>, we get the brightest example of the heavenly man.<a name=5:13></a> A man caught up into Paradise, who heard unspeakable words which it was not possible for a man to utter.<a name=5:14></a> He was caught up into the place without going there bodily.<a name=5:15></a> He is sensibly in the enjoyment of it; so sensibly that, for the moment, he has lost his link with the earth.<a name=5:16></a> I do not say that souls do not get a taste of it now-a-days; but, as they do, they get a deeper sense of the wilderness.<a name=5:17></a> Paul did: "there was given me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me".<a name=5:18></a> For this he cried to the Lord three times; and He said: "My grace is sufficient for thee; for my strength is made perfect in weakness" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#12:7">2 Corinthians  12:7</a> - 9).<a name=5:19></a> I gave it you lest you should be puffed up-lest you should get out of the place of dependence.<a name=5:20></a> And then see how Paul comes round, how beautifully he accepts it; he says: "Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities".<a name=5:21></a> Whilst not out of the wilderness, I have entered on the enjoyment of heaven, and I can go back to it; but I am made sensible that I am to be more of a dependent man that I ever was before.<a name=5:22></a> What tried Paul.<a name=5:23></a> was, that he lost the ability to expound this very thing

		There is not time to go into chapter 11, but it opens with showing at what an immense cost they were brought into the land.<a name=6:3></a> I believe the great hindrance to every soul getting on is, not that it does 'not know the glory' - every soul has that - but that it does not know the cross.<a name=6:4></a> The cross has taken everything away, and left only Christ.<a name=6:5></a> It is not the glory that takes things away.<a name=6:6></a> Paul says: "God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#6:14">Galatians  6:14</a>).<a name=6:7></a> It is the cross that takes all away.<a name=6:8></a> Paul is a bright specimen of a heavenly man.<a name=6:9></a>

		Now I will show you one who lost the heavenly thing, as many do, by not being dependent.<a name=6:10></a> In <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#33">Genesis  33</a>.<a name=6:11></a> Jacob has come back to the land.<a name=6:12></a> There have been real power and grace shown in restoring him; but like many a one he thinks to rest in what he has attained.<a name=6:13></a> He builds a house, buys a field, and erects an altar, calling it El-Elohe-Israel.<a name=6:14></a> He does not give up truth, but he makes truth the thing that is before him, instead of God, who has brought him to Himself.<a name=6:15></a> He ought to have gone to Bethel.<a name=6:16></a> When at last he does get there, he finds quite another order of things.<a name=6:17></a> At Shechem he is a heavenly man; but he wants to rest in things here, and not to be dependent.<a name=6:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What is the consequence?<a name=6:19></a> He is brought into the most humiliating state.<a name=6:20></a> He says: "I shall be destroyed, I and my house" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#34:30">Genesis  34:30</a>).<a name=6:21></a> He has to be subjected to all this in order to make him true to his calling.<a name=6:22></a>

		The Lord make us see what a wonderful place we are called to.<a name=6:23></a> I do not believe a soul ever has really known the presence of Christ if it have not at some time or other, known what it is to have everything lost to it for the moment.<a name=6:24></a> But, when after such a moment, you return to this scene, do not be surprised if some new form of trial come upon you,

		It is a great thing to know why a book was written; to be able to see why God sets forth His mind in the way He does in it.<a name=8:1></a> So it is well to read a book through before forming a judgement on it; for, from an isolated passage, it is impossible to get at the bearing of it.<a name=8:2></a> You may for instance read: "Woe unto them that rise up early", and stop there.<a name=8:3></a> The context is therefore the best explanation to what it is in connection with.<a name=8:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The book of Hebrews was written to Jewish converts, to show them how superior Christianity is to Judaism, though Judaism in itself was a good thing - was of God.<a name=8:5></a> None of us ought to have needed Hebrews, but, as Christianity has dropped down into Judaism, it is necessary for us to read it; we may be very like the Jews, but we have no right to be.<a name=8:6></a> How far above and superior to anything that ever was before it, is the Christian position!<a name=8:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son".<a name=8:8></a> That is not true of us, but it was of the Jewish converts.<a name=8:9></a> "Whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:1">Hebrews  1:1</a> - 2).<a name=8:10></a> This is a matter of faith; we believe that He did so.<a name=8:11></a>

		I may say that Hebrews is a child's book; it is addressed to a child - to babes.<a name=9:5></a> It is a book in which the believer is looked at in his lowest position.<a name=9:6></a> There is no union, no being in heaven, though there is going on to heaven; so it is a very simple book.<a name=9:7></a> In one sense we are all little children, because we know so little; but it is the simplest book we can take up.<a name=9:8></a> It takes the bright side of things here; Peter takes the dark one.<a name=9:9></a> He says there are desperate things out there; be sober, be vigilant.<a name=9:10></a> And we must have the two; if we have not we shall not get on; we must have the intercession of Christ as well as the sword of the Spirit.<a name=9:11></a> The Lord said, I will pray for you; but that did not keep Peter because he did not fight the devil.<a name=9:12></a> So that is the side he takes up, that we must fight the devil, for it is what he did not do himself.<a name=9:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is most important to get hold of the fact that Christ was only called away from earth because of the state of things here, to wait until that state should be altered.<a name=9:18></a> Things here were such that He was called to leave them until the time that there should be a change -- till His enemies should be made His footstool.<a name=9:19></a> This it the time that we are in.<a name=9:20></a> It is like a sentence between brackets.<a name=9:21></a> God has called Him away because of the state of things here, and, if I be an honest and a righteous man, I shall own things to be in that state, and look for Him to come back to put an end to it.<a name=9:22></a> It is a parallel time to that in the gospels, where it says: "Neither

		"Sit on my right hand".<a name=10:2></a> The apostle delights in this passage; here he quotes it to show that Christ is called away from things here by Jehovah; and in chapter 10.<a name=10:3></a> to show that He can sit down because the work is finished: "After he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God".<a name=10:4></a> (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:12">Hebrews  10:12</a>) But the quotation coming in thus in chapter 1 is very important, as it points out the interval with which all our blessings is concerned.<a name=10:5></a> I do not belong to the place where my Lord is rejected, but to the place where He is received.<a name=10:6></a> If I am not within those brackets I have nothing.<a name=10:7></a> His rejection is one bracket.<a name=10:8></a> His return the other; we stand between the rejection and the return.<a name=10:9></a>

		STEPHEN, A PATTERN OF WHAT IT IS TO BE FOR CHRIST ON EARTH
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7">Acts  7</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Stephen and the thief on the cross are pattern men.<a name=100:1></a> In the latter, I get the pattern illustration of grace to a sinner; in the former, God's pattern specimen of a saint on earth linked to Christ in heaven.<a name=100:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Stephen is the pattern of a man that was not only going to God, but one who was for God on the earth; he not only knew what it was to belong to Christ in glory, but he was for Christ on earth.<a name=100:3></a> We have here the account of how he finished his course for God on the earth.<a name=100:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He died; that showed he was faithful unto death.<a name=100:5></a> But some one says to me.<a name=100:6></a> Can you point to an example that continued?<a name=100:7></a> Yes I can, Paul, he continued; he was sent back here after being in the third heaven.<a name=100:8></a> In Stephen, I get an example of what heaven is to a saint going to die.<a name=100:9></a> In Paul, of what heaven is to a saint going to live.<a name=100:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are not all called as Stephen to martyrdom, but we have all the same grace, and Stephen is set before us as a pattern man, just as I should say to an unbeliever that the thief on the cross is the pattern man of grace.<a name=100:11></a> Stephen is the first one set before us actually as a heavenly man; he is the first man upon whom heaven opened.<a name=100:12></a> Enoch was translated, and Elijah went up to heaven in a chariot of fire, but that is not heaven being opened on man; heaven did open on the Lord Jesus Christ, but He was more than a man.<a name=100:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The heavens open here on Stephen, and he <i>sees</i> his Saviour up there, and so he is for his Saviour down here.<a name=100:14></a> There are two marks that belong to a believer now.<a name=100:15></a> One is, that by the Holy Spirit you are associated

		<a name=101>[Page 101]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		with Christ where Christ is; and the other, that you have the power of Christ where Christ is not.<a name=101:1></a> I trust you will remember these two.<a name=101:2></a> They are for each one of us; not only for a Stephen in giving up his life, but for everyone of us in whatever difficulties we have to pass through, be it a mother of a large family with all around to disturb and distract, or anything else, whatever it be, I say to you that these are the two marks of what grace can do for you.<a name=101:3></a> I have association with my Saviour where my Saviour is, and I have the power of my Saviour where my Saviour is not.<a name=101:4></a> When Paul came down from the third heaven, what was it for?<a name=101:5></a> That the power of Christ might rest upon him.<a name=101:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you want to be powerful, to have practical power while walking down here, it must be by looking above, by association with Christ where Christ is.<a name=101:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let me say here, that when your heart gets liberty, or rather deliverance, when it gets clear of judgment, the first, the chief thing that shows you are clear of judgment is that you want your Saviour.<a name=101:8></a> First you seek relief from your sin, from the burden, then you seek the One who relieved you.<a name=101:9></a> Like a man who is drowning, first he wants some one to save him, but when he has recovered a little, he says, I should like to see that man who, at the risk of his life, saved me.<a name=101:10></a> He looked first for deliverance, and next for his deliverer.<a name=101:11></a> Take another example.<a name=101:12></a> Jonathan did not look for David until Goliath was slain.<a name=101:13></a> When David struck at Goliath, Jonathan was not thinking of David, but when he saw the head of Goliath in David's hand, what then?<a name=101:14></a> The soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David.<a name=101:15></a> That is the way it always comes.<a name=101:16></a> A person may be converted, and may be very genuine, and still not be looking for Christ where Christ is.<a name=101:17></a> He may, like Jonathan, see Goliath on the ground, but not be quite happy;

		but when be sees the head in David's hand, what now?<a name=102:1></a> He says, as it were, l am going to give up all my thoughts to David.<a name=102:2></a> And that is what we get in John's gospel (chapter 1).<a name=102:3></a> When those two disciples followed our Lord, When they followed Him as the Lamb of God, their first question was, "Where dwellest thou?<a name=102:4></a>" Beloved friends, have you ever put that question to Him?<a name=102:5></a> Where dwellest thou?<a name=102:6></a> Do you remember the answer of the Lord, -- "Come and see";?<a name=102:7></a> And do you not think He would say that to you if you asked him?<a name=102:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is what Stephen did.<a name=102:9></a> He, "being full of the Holy Spirit .<a name=102:10></a>.<a name=102:11></a>.<a name=102:12></a> fixed his eyes on heaven".<a name=102:13></a> (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7:55">Acts  7:55</a>) He saw Jesus there in the glory of God.<a name=102:14></a>

		See what <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3">Colossians  3</a>, says, "Set your affection, on things above".<a name=102:15></a> Where?<a name=102:16></a> Where Christ is -- above, "where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God", (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3:1">Colossians  3:1</a> - 2)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that is what the Holy Spirit sets before us in the case of Stephen.<a name=102:17></a> The heavens are opened, and he "saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on, the right hand of God".<a name=102:18></a> (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7:55">Acts  7:55</a>) How was he able to look up to that glory?<a name=102:19></a> There was no check.<a name=102:20></a> The Spirit could not say, you must not look in here; on the contrary, the Spirit of God <i>showed</i> him what was there: "Being full of the Holy Spirit".<a name=102:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is the introduction; and, as I have said, Stephen was a pattern, not merely as a great martyr, but he sets forth what a heavenly man is.<a name=102:22></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, let me turn to a verse or two (<a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#1:26">Ezekiel  1:26</a>) Here the prophet sees the glory of God on the earth.<a name=102:23></a> God connected Himself with the earth, as we see in the tabernacle, in the glory cloud by day, and in the pillar of fire by night.<a name=102:24></a> In chapter 1, the glory was going away, leaving the earth, because Israel was so wicked.<a name=102:25></a> God could not connect Himself any longer with them .<a name=102:26></a>He is retiring.<a name=102:27></a> But now what is the wonderful thing?<a name=102:28></a> As the prophet sees the glory retiring, what is there?<a name=102:29></a> There is the figure of a man

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now if you turn to <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:9">Luke  2:9</a>, we read, "And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them".<a name=103:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The glory never came back to the earth from the time it had gone away in Ezekiel till now.<a name=103:7></a> Now it had come back to announce this, "And the angel said unto them.<a name=103:8></a> Fear not?<a name=103:9></a> for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.<a name=103:10></a> For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord".<a name=103:11></a> (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:10">Luke  2:10</a> - 11) There the glory has come down to announce the birth of the Saviour, that there might be a Man in the glory of God for us.<a name=103:12></a> Here we have, in the Babe that is born, the Man -- God manifest in flesh.<a name=103:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now turn to chapter 9, of this gospel, verse 29.<a name=103:14></a> "And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering.<a name=103:15></a> And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias: who appeared in glory, and spake of His decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.<a name=103:16></a> But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory".<a name=103:17></a> (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#9:29">Luke  9:29</a> - 32) Now mark, beloved friends, from that time (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2">Luke  2</a>), when from the glory it is announced that He is come, He spends thirty years in retirement.<a name=103:18></a> It is sometimes said that Christ went from the cradle to the grave, but that is not a correct way of expressing it.<a name=103:19></a> He was thirty years in retirement.<a name=103:20></a> At the end of it heaven opened upon Him, and announced its fullest delight.<a name=103:21></a> A voice proclaiming the Father's good pleasure in

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is interesting to notice the particular circumstances in which we find these Corinthians.<a name=137:1></a> They were an assembly highly favoured of God.<a name=137:2></a> Paul says: "I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ; that in everything ye are enriched by him in all utterance, and in all knowledge; .<a name=137:3></a>.<a name=137:4></a>.<a name=137:5></a> so that ye come behind in no gift;" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:4">1 Corinthians  1:4</a>) and they were "called unto the fellowship of his Son".<a name=137:6></a> (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:9">1 Corinthians  1:9</a>).<a name=137:7></a> It was not possible to get any higher than that.<a name=137:8></a> Everything that could be done was done for them on God's side.<a name=137:9></a> But on their own side they were not "dead to sin", as Romans says they should have been; they did not walk in self- judgment.<a name=137:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The great subject of the epistle is in chapter 1: 29: "That no flesh should glory in his presence".<a name=137:11></a> (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:29">1 Corinthians  1:29</a>) The point, therefore, that he presses between these verses, 9 and 29, is the cross.<a name=137:12></a> It is "Christ crucified", and that not in connection with sin; indeed, except in chapter 15, I do not remember that the word "sin" occurs in the epistle; but it is "<i>no flesh</i>"is to glory, hence he dwells upon the <i>cross:</i> We preach Christ crucified.<a name=137:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		They were seeking wisdom; they sought a mental view of divine things.<a name=137:14></a> Wisdom was the great desire of the Corinthians.<a name=137:15></a> Hence it is, If you would have the wisdom of God you must reach it through crucifixion.<a name=137:16></a> It is "Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification and redemption.<a name=137:17></a> That, according as it is written, he that glorieth, let him glory in <i>the Lord</i> " (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:30">1 Corinthians  1:30</a> - 31) If you seek divine wisdom, wisdom of God, <i>we</i> preach Christ crucified; and if you learn Christ crucified,

		you then learn that He is the wisdom of God.<a name=138:1></a> They were looking for wisdom without the cross.<a name=138:2></a> He proposes to them wisdom through the cross.<a name=138:3></a> So he puts wisdom the first on the list.<a name=138:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 2, he opens out the subject more fully: "I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified".<a name=138:5></a> (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:2">1 Corinthians  2:2</a>) Now this is a very large subject.<a name=138:6></a> It is "<i>Jesus Christ</i>".<a name=138:7></a> It is no longer a Subject but a Person.<a name=138:8></a> The great aspect of His ministry, the speciality of it is "Jesus Christ, and him crucified".<a name=138:9></a> The more you dwell upon this, the greater you find it.<a name=138:10></a> If you try and describe Jesus Christ you will find what an immense Subject is before your mind.<a name=138:11></a> When you think of the person of the Son of God, you are <i>lost</i>.<a name=138:12></a> But when you bring this Person down to a certain practical point, then that is a speciality.<a name=138:13></a> And that is what Paul does here.<a name=138:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In verses 5 to 10, he contrasts man's wisdom and God's wisdom, beginning with the former.<a name=138:15></a> And then comes the great point of his argument.<a name=138:16></a> But, before touching on this, just a word in explanation of the state of the Corinthians.<a name=138:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are three steps in Christian infancy.<a name=138:18></a> The first is that everything that was against me is cleared away from the eye of God by the work of Christ; not a thing has God against me; He has placed me in His favour.<a name=138:19></a> That is the epistle to the Romans.<a name=138:20></a> The second is that the Holy Spirit has come down and united me to Christ in glory: This is the epistle to the Corinthians.<a name=138:21></a> The apostle, was not at Corinth between writing his two epistles to the assembly there.<a name=138:22></a> What he speaks of in the second epistle he had taught them when there.<a name=138:23></a> The third step is, that I go back to the cross of Christ to get rid of in myself, everything that hinders the life of Jesus in me.<a name=138:24></a> Many saints only get so far as the second step.<a name=138:25></a> They are like the children of Israel, who, when they came through the Red Sea; got a sense of perfect deliverance, but

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first point of the apostle's argument is.<a name=139:5></a> The wisdom of God cannot be reached by the natural mind.<a name=139:6></a> "Eye has not seen".<a name=139:7></a> How then can you glory in the flesh?<a name=139:8></a> It cannot reach it.<a name=139:9></a> You will see a person in the first stage of infancy trying by his natural mind to grasp and be an expositor of the great things of God, and, as the result, failure comes in.<a name=139:10></a> They have not "entered into the heart of man .<a name=139:11></a>.<a name=139:12></a>.<a name=139:13></a> but God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit".<a name=139:14></a> (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:9">1 Corinthians  2:9</a> - 10) It is the most conclusive argument.<a name=139:15></a> Lf l cannot grasp the truth of God with the natural mind, then the natural mind is of no avail here.<a name=139:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first point then is, that the natural mind cannot grasp God's wisdom; and the second (chapter 3), that if the material be not divine, the fire of God will consume it.<a name=139:17></a> Take care what you bring into the church.<a name=139:18></a> Let the builders see to it what they do.<a name=139:19></a> If anything of the flesh be brought into God's building, the day will destroy it.<a name=139:20></a> That carnal thing that is brought into the building, it will not stand the fire.<a name=139:21></a> I, as a, builder, may bring in that which is not sound; if so, it will come to nought.<a name=139:22></a> lf it be not divine work it will not stand the fire.<a name=139:23></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 4, the ministry itself is of God, and man only to be thought of as coming from God.<a name=139:24></a> If the ministry be of God, all those who are fruits of that ministry ought to be in keeping with it.<a name=139:25></a> But, says the apostle to the Corinthians, you are the very opposite of this; in plain language, you are not a bit like your father; not at all like us; you are full, you are rich; .<a name=139:26></a>God.<a name=139:27></a> has set forth us, the apostles, as it

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 5, he turns to another side: how their moral sense of what is due to God's house is lost.<a name=140:9></a> To show them how this sense had declined, he is actually obliged to give them a list of the people from whom they must separate (5: 11).<a name=140:10></a> Their moral sense had become so blunt through not judging the flesh, that they were content to go in association with such.<a name=140:11></a> But if Christ has borne the judgment of the flesh, the flesh cannot be tolerated.<a name=140:12></a> The body really is to be the exponent here of the life of Christ; this body that used to be the exhibition of all the natural things of man's life, now becomes the exhibition, through divine grace, of the life and ways of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=140:13></a> He does not include in the list the worst characters; he does not say, you have no moral sense at all; for instance a murderer is not mentioned; the grosser crimes are not alluded to.<a name=140:14></a> It is just a list to quicken their moral sense, but not one that supposes them entirely deficient of any.<a name=140:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next comes out that, because they are wrong in their relations with God, they are not able to get on among themselves.<a name=140:16></a> Chapter 6 opens: "Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust and not before the saints?<a name=140:17></a>" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#6:1">1 Corinthians  6:1</a>) They cannot judge the things of God in His own house,

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the body is looked at in three aspects in Scripture.<a name=141:5></a> First: "in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die;" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:17">Genesis  2:17</a>).<a name=141:6></a> Death is its portion.<a name=141:7></a> Second; the Son of God comes in and redeems it.<a name=141:8></a> So that that which Satan used to use as his own, Christ says is now Mine.<a name=141:9></a> Therefore it is, "Glorify God in your body".<a name=141:10></a> (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#6:20">1 Corinthians  6:20</a>) The word "spirit", should not be read there.<a name=141:11></a> That we are members of the body of Christ is corporate truth; but that our body is the member of Christ is individual.<a name=141:12></a> Take care then what you do with your body; do not take it to a flower show; do not put a beautiful dress on it.<a name=141:13></a> We, in our bodies, are all members, of Christ, but that does not make us members of one another.<a name=141:14></a> That which makes us members of one another is the baptism of the Holy Spirit; that makes us members of the body of Christ, which is another truth.<a name=141:15></a> Here it is my own individual responsibility to represent Christ.<a name=141:16></a> Thank God l am a member, of the body of Christ too, but this framework of a body is not a member of the <i>body</i> of Christ, though it is a <i>member</i> of Christ, and is to express his life here below, and I am to receive according to the deeds done in it.<a name=141:17></a>

		Let me first say a word as to the church, the body of Christ.<a name=191:2></a> It is "the mystery" of which Paul tells us in the Ephesians; it is the secret of God which could not be divulged until after the rejection of Christ from the earth.<a name=191:3></a> When the Lord said to His disciples that He would build a new structure.<a name=191:4></a> His church, there was nothing in that about the body.<a name=191:5></a> It would have been premature to have spoken of it before His rejection.<a name=191:6></a> And even immediately on His ascension we get nothing as to it.<a name=191:7></a> In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>, the disciples are distinctly told <i>not</i> to look up into heaven, where the Head of the body was gone.<a name=191:8></a> It is only when we get to chapter 7, when the nation has rejected the testimony of the Holy Spirit come down from heaven to witness to an ascended and glorified Christ, that we find a man led by the Spirit to look up there, and who sees, as he does so, Jesus in the glory of God.<a name=191:9></a> It is after that He says to Saul of Tarsus, "Why persecutest thou <i>me</i>?<a name=191:10></a>" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:4">Acts  9:4</a>) The truth comes out that He regards the saints here as Himself.<a name=191:11></a>

		Satan brought all his forces to bear against the Lord Jesus when He was here; his one object was to remove the Son of God from the scene.<a name=191:12></a> It was not now merely the sin of the garden of Eden; it was not simple disobedience; there was now no cloke for man's sin; the Son of God had come down to earth, and done among men works which none other had done, and they had both seen and hated both Him and His Father.<a name=191:13></a> The most marvellous expression

		But after the Son of God was thus rejected by man and taken up into heaven, there came out this secret that His body was still upon earth to represent Him.<a name=192:2></a> What, through the dark ages?<a name=192:3></a> Yes, then just as truly as in the present moment.<a name=192:4></a> Souls do not believe it.<a name=192:5></a> They do not believe that united by this bond they are as close to a brother in Australia as to one in their own town in England.<a name=192:6></a> Of course I am not so <i>responsible</i> for the brother at a distance as the one beside me; so in Romans and Ephesians a brother is called a "<i>neighbour</i>" -- "Love worketh no ill to his neighbour" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#13:10">Romans  13:10</a>) and "speak every man truth with his neighbour".<a name=192:7></a> (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:25">Ephesians  4:25</a>) But we are all brought into this new bond, "members one of another", a bond which overrides every other; and I will add, that I never saw a man defective in the higher bond who was not also defective in the lower ones.<a name=192:8></a>

		How different the state of Israel in Samuel's time to what it was in the time of Joshua!<a name=198:3></a> What power there was in the way the ark went round the city of Jericho and the walls fell down flat.<a name=198:4></a> Such was the power of that day -- a power that was invisible.<a name=198:5></a> It was a moment when what they were aiming at seemed impossible, as it has done many a time since; a moment such as many of us have doubtless seen, when there was no way out, and everything seemed hopeless.<a name=198:6></a> And then what happened?<a name=198:7></a> As at Jericho, God's hand came in, and the walls fell down flat.<a name=198:8></a>

		But then in the moment of success one individual takes a goodly Babylonish garment and a wedge of gold, and hides them under his tent, and God cannot go on with the people.<a name=198:9></a> It is wonderful how much harm one man can do.<a name=198:10></a> In Achan the innate corruption of the race broke out.<a name=198:11></a> I say 'of the race', because we find that the door of escape opened for Israel in the latter day is this very valley of Achor where Achan was stoned.<a name=198:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing, then, that the remnant must have is <i>holiness</i> I repeat, we <i>must</i> have <i>separation</i>.<a name=199:2></a> We must if we are coming to pray; we must be able to lift up "<i>holy hands</i>".<a name=199:3></a> We positively come to God sometimes as if He did not see what we were about.<a name=199:4></a> It is a great blessing and a great happiness to see the ground God has set us on.<a name=199:5></a> It is that of separation from evil; that is the first characteristic, as we have seen.<a name=199:6></a> Samuel says to the people: "If ye do return unto the Lord with all your hearts, then put away the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the Lord, and serve him only".<a name=199:7></a> (<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#7:3">1 Samuel  7:3</a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And the next thing is <i>dependence</i>, he says, "I will <i>pray</i> for you unto the Lord".<a name=199:8></a> (<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#7:5">1 Samuel  7:5</a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then thirdly comes defending, "The Philistines drew near to battle against Israel".<a name=199:9></a> (<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#7:10">1 Samuel  7:10</a>) You ask.<a name=199:10></a> Do you like fighting?<a name=199:11></a> No, I say, I do not; but the most timid animal makes a great fighter when what is most dear to it is assailed.<a name=199:12></a> See a hen when a dog attacks her chickens, how she will defend them!<a name=199:13></a> And why?<a name=199:14></a> Because there is <i>love</i> there.<a name=199:15></a> It is the greatest lover who makes the best defender.<a name=199:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So I say, separation, dependence, defending, and success mark the remnant.<a name=199:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2">Luke  2</a>, we find another picture of the remnant.<a name=199:18></a> I find two people here who mark the remnant when the Lord first comes into the temple: Simeon sets forth one aspect of it, and Anna the other.<a name=199:19></a> To the one it was revealed that "he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ", (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:26">Luke  2:26</a>) and the other "departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day".<a name=199:20></a> (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:37">Luke  2:37</a>) Thus we get in the two the remnant adhering to the thing that marked the period.<a name=199:21></a>

		And the Lord Jesus is found in the same path; He goes into the temple and drives out thence the sheep and the oxen and the changers of money, saying, "Make not my Father's house an house of merchandise".<a name=200:1></a> (<a href="../bible/John.htm#2:16">John  2:16</a>) He says, I must look after the temple -- after what belongs to God upon earth.<a name=200:2></a> And this is just what characterises the remnant: it always adheres to what belongs to God upon earth.<a name=200:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, when the Lord goes out of the temple for the last time, "he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites.<a name=200:4></a> And he said.<a name=200:5></a> Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all: for all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the living she had".<a name=200:6></a> (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#21:2">Luke  21:2</a> - 4) The poor widow gives all that she has for God's interests here; for what belongs to Him on the earth.<a name=200:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now let us turn to the second epistle to Timothy to see how the remnant comes out in the present day.<a name=200:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe a great defect in our thoughts of the remnant lies in the fact that we do not take into consideration what the original thing was.<a name=200:9></a> We shall never understand the characteristics of the remnant if we do not see clearly what the church was at the first.<a name=200:10></a> Do not think that I mean we shall have the original thing back again?<a name=200:11></a> I do not; but I do say that we must return to beginnings.<a name=200:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In 2 Timothy I find that the church has got into a very corrupt state.<a name=200:13></a> Corruption has come into the house.<a name=200:14></a> And finding things thus in such corruption, the duty of faithful ones purging themselves from it comes out.<a name=200:15></a> "If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work".<a name=200:16></a> (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:21">2 Timothy  2:21</a>) The word "purge" only occurs twice in Scripture: once in this passage; the other in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5">1 Corinthians  5</a>.<a name=200:17></a> There it consists in purging out of leaven from the assembly; here, in purging out

		yourself.<a name=201:1></a> It is interesting to see the word only occurs twice; little things of this sort help us in the understanding of God's word.<a name=201:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what calls for this purging out of the individual?<a name=201:3></a> For myself I do not see at present that I should ever separate from a meeting on account of <i>leaven</i>, but when the <i>maintenance</i> of the leaven is insisted on, then it becomes <i>canker</i> and must be separated from.<a name=201:4></a> Canker can be kept out of companies gathered on the ground of the church of God, and if any such refuse to purge out the <i>evil</i>, then one must purge out <i>oneself</i>, for they cease to be on that ground.<a name=201:5></a> But I maintain that the place I am in is God's house, and because I believe in the presence of the Holy Spirit in it, I do not suffer a bit of evil in the house.<a name=201:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And, in thus caring for the holiness of it, I shall not find myself in a place of isolation; I shall never be without company.<a name=201:7></a> This is an immense comfort.<a name=201:8></a> The Lord has not left the house.<a name=201:9></a> So here the apostle does not say to Timothy, You are all alone, there is no one left so good as you are; no, but there are others who "call on the Lord out of a pure heart", and you must "follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:22">2 Timothy  2:22</a>) with them, and thus help the whole church of God.<a name=201:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what are our colours?<a name=201:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing that Christendom did was to give up the colours.<a name=201:12></a> Rome deputed a man to represent Christ on the earth, whilst Christ had sent the Holy Spirit from the Father to testify of Himself through His body, the church.<a name=201:13></a> So numbers who instinctively seek Christ's rule on earth, and do not know where to find it, go over to romanism, and are deceived by this counterfeit.<a name=201:14></a> On the other hand, protestantism has rejected the wrong one, but has not apprehended the right One; and many who have accepted as a fact the truth of the presence of the Holy Spirit

		on earth make infidels of themselves in not acting up to what they believe.<a name=202:1></a> Do you think if I really believed the Holy Spirit were here, I should not look to Him instead of to human means of one kind and another in preaching the gospel, for instance?<a name=202:2></a> How could I accept revivalism if I believed in the presence of the holy Spirit?<a name=202:3></a> How could I trust to boards outside preaching rooms to bring in hearers, instead of to His leading?<a name=202:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You may answer.<a name=202:5></a> But the Holy Spirit is here to <i>comfort</i> us during the absence of Christ; Very true, He is here sent by the Father in the name of Christ to be the Comforter of His people, which we see in chapter 14:26; but in chapter 15:26 He Is sent <i>from the Father</i>, expressly for the testimony; we read, "He shall testify of me".<a name=202:6></a> And again, in chapter 16: 14, "He shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you".<a name=202:7></a> (<a href="../bible/John.htm#16:14">John  16:14</a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I say, then, that the colours and the responsibility of the remnant is, that the Holy Spirit is here to maintain for Christ.<a name=202:8></a> But, even amongst those who believe it as an article of faith, there is such looseness in carrying it into practice, that the consequence is, numbers are found on the ground of the remnant who are there with very little conscience as to their position.<a name=202:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to evangelising, I believe the real thing, that which is most owned of God, is to go from house to house.<a name=202:10></a> It might be more laborious, but it would certainly be more effective.<a name=202:11></a> Of course there is the public thing as well, that is proclamation, and I wish there were more of it.<a name=202:12></a> But I insist upon the presence of the Holy Spirit in carrying it out.<a name=202:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I now turn for another thing that characterises the remnant, to a passage that is in the mouth of you all: "Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst".<a name=202:14></a> (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:20">Matthew  18:20</a>) Remark they are to be "<i>gathered</i>".<a name=202:15></a> Each one must be led to His

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is one of the defects of brethren that they think they know everything, but I believe that very little is known of the Lord's presence in the midst of His gathered ones.<a name=203:5></a> When we are around Him it is not a question of what ministry there will be, of what I shall hear, but of whether the Lord Himself will speak to me.<a name=203:6></a> There is an old adage that 'a crooked loaf will feed a man'.<a name=203:7></a> We have accepted the fact that Christ <i>is</i> in the midst of His church, and I do not know any greater favour that God has ever shewn me than that of bringing me into His place upon earth; but, as in the days of Nehemiah, "there is much rubbish" with the truth we have.<a name=203:8></a> As our epistle tells us, we are in "perilous times", and there is no apostle, for perilous times.<a name=203:9></a> The second epistle of Peter, and Jude, give us descriptions of these same times; but there is always left to us the holy scriptures, which are sufficient to make the man of God "perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works".<a name=203:10></a> (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#3:17">2 Timothy  3:17</a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But whilst, on the one hand, God has provided power for His people even in "perilous times", there are those who, like Jannes and Jambres, in the days of Moses, withstand the truth by <i>imitating</i> power.<a name=203:11></a> A person once, speaking of the lawfulness of any means to reach souls, asked me, 'Do you not think it is right to weep in preaching the gospel?<a name=203:12></a>' 'Never', I answered, 'if it is to make <i>others</i> weep'.<a name=203:13></a> And this imitation never succeeds in reaching the real thing;

		Now we come to the subject of service down here while we do not lose the bright scene above.<a name=267:1></a> That is the place of retirement from which we are made ready to come forth as servants.<a name=267:2></a> We come from God.<a name=267:3></a> The failure in service is that people very generally do <i>not</i> come to it from God.<a name=267:4></a> But for all effectual service we must come from God, and therefore place service after worship.<a name=267:5></a> I come from the joy of the Lord: "As my Father hath sent me, even so send I you".<a name=267:6></a> (<a href="../bible/John.htm#20:21">John  20:21</a>) He was sent into the world, and so are we.<a name=267:7></a> We must be out of it before we can be sent into it and each one is sent with a special vocation, a special mission.<a name=267:8></a>

		<ol><li>Moral influence.<a name=267:9></a></li><li>Any kind of acts.<a name=267:10></a></li><li>Gifts.<a name=267:11></a></li></ol>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There may be service where there is no acting at all but moral influence: "Shine as lights in the world;" (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:15">Philippians  2:15</a>) that is not doing; it is moral influence.<a name=267:12></a> We have all orders of service in this chapter, whilst in Ephesians we have more especially gifts.<a name=267:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing to consider is, what is service <i>now</i>?<a name=267:14></a> If we look at the service of the tabernacle, it was different altogether from what it is now.<a name=267:15></a> Service now consists in my being sent out as Christ's deputy to carry out in this world what Christ is.<a name=267:16></a> I am placed according to divine grace in the same state as Christ is in heaven at the right hand of God; and I am sent into the world as He was.<a name=267:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next, what does service aim at?<a name=267:18></a> <i>State</i>.<a name=267:19></a> A true servant is one who will "care for your state".<a name=267:20></a> He does not merely do a work for you to satisfy his own

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This gives an immense idea of what service is.<a name=268:4></a> It is of a new character, and the Lord opens it out in <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>.<a name=268:5></a> That is the first time in which service comes out as a ministry of the word.<a name=268:6></a> It is not confined to gifts; it is entirely connected with the state; it consists in removing the thing that interferes with communion.<a name=268:7></a> If I wash your feet it is to remove what interferes with your communion; so if I do not know your state I cannot know what interferes with your communion.<a name=268:8></a> This gives a new character to service altogether; it is considering for the state of others.<a name=268:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The mind of Christ (chapter 2) is the highest state in Philippians, whilst in chapter 4, you cannot do without Him in all the difficulties of the world.<a name=268:10></a> Your occupation with Christ is to the end to get help from Him.<a name=268:11></a> How am I to get on here?<a name=268:12></a> I look to Him, and, "I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me".<a name=268:13></a> (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#4:13">Philippians  4:13</a>)

		But in chapter 3 it is very different.<a name=268:14></a> Christ is the object of my heart: it is <i>Himself</i> I want, not merely His help.<a name=268:15></a> Many think they are occupied with Christ when it is only help they want; but if I am occupied simply with Christ I, of necessity, seek association with Him where He is.<a name=268:16></a> That is the mark of real occupation of heart with Christ Himself.<a name=268:17></a> It is preposterous for a man to tell me he is occupied with Christ if be does not seek association with Christ where Christ is.<a name=268:18></a> Look at the disciples in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>"Why stand ye gazing up into heaven?<a name=268:19></a>" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:11">Acts  1:11</a>) Look at Stephen (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7">Acts  7</a>): "Being full of the Holy Spirit, having <i>fixed his eyes on heaven</i>, he saw the glory of

		I divide the first seven verses of this psalm into three parts.<a name=315:8></a> Verses 1 and 2 are the first part: "Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.<a name=315:9></a> Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile".<a name=315:10></a> (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#32:1">Psalm  32:1</a> - 2) Here is a blessed ray of divine light coming down into this world, and what it announces is blessing to the man who is forgiven, not to the man who works.<a name=315:11></a> (See <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#4:6">Romans  4:6</a> - 8) If you have got that ray you find you are forgiven.<a name=315:12></a> The wonderful truth from God at this moment is that if the greatest sinner on this earth were brought into the glory of God, instead of being consumed, he would find a Saviour there.<a name=315:13></a> "There is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared".<a name=315:14></a> (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#130:4">Psalm  130:4</a>) But there are two things in the portion of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#32">Psalm  32</a>quoted in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#4">Romans  4</a>.<a name=315:15></a> It says not only that God forgives your <i>sins</i>, but also that He will not impute <i>sin</i> to you.<a name=315:16></a> He forgives you what you have done, and He does not impute to you what you are.<a name=315:17></a> Many a person might be able to say, 'I believe my sins are forgiven', but if I ask him, 'Is sin imputed to you?<a name=315:18></a>'

		THE MYSTERY
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:1">Colossians  2:1</a> - 10
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We see in the opening verse of this chapter how earnestly the apostle desired the truth he was bringing before them to be apprehended in power by the saints to whom he was writing.<a name=324:1></a> He was <i>most</i> anxious that they should know it.<a name=324:2></a> He says, "What great conflict I have for you"; (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:1">Colossians  2:1</a>) it is a strong word.<a name=324:3></a> There was something standing in the way; there was something hindering their apprehension of it.<a name=324:4></a> And, on his side, it was not a thing that it was easy to present to them; so that he could speak of his own feelings with regard to the matter, not only as even a <i>conflict</i>, but as a "great conflict".<a name=324:5></a> And this truth that caused him so much anxiety was <i>the mystery</i>.<a name=324:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have been surprised to find how little people know what the mystery is, and yet it is of the utmost importance that they should know it.<a name=324:7></a> The reason why the apostle so desired the saints at Colosse to know it was because he saw that they were exposed to a snare.<a name=324:8></a> Now people often think that they know enough truth, but nothing protects from a snare but truth in power.<a name=324:9></a> The Colossians were in danger of religiousness of a twofold character: one, which appealed to the mind, we should call rationalism at the present time; the other, which affected the body, we should call ritualism.<a name=324:10></a> The danger of the saints, then, was a compound composed of these two things, which affected both mind and body.<a name=324:11></a>

		different.<a name=325:1></a> Here it is a <i>religious</i> man.<a name=325:2></a> I cannot dwell upon the subject now, it is not my object to do so; I do not wish to dwell upon the bad side, for it is our great and precious privilege to maintain and know the good, and the more I do that, the more I ward off the bad.<a name=325:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I wish then to bring before you this evening is the mystery which the apostle was so anxious that the Colossians should enter into.<a name=325:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Possibly very many of you could give a very clear definition of the mystery, who yet may not have reached to "the full assurance of understanding" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:2">Colossians  2:2</a>) it: "Full assurance" here does not mean that I am <i>sure</i> of it, but that I understand the <i>weight</i> of it.<a name=325:5></a> And the word "knowledge" does not mean simply <i>knowing</i> a thing, but possessing <i>complete</i> knowledge of it.<a name=325:6></a> If we have this, we shall never be drawn aside from it to the false thing, to religiousness in man.<a name=325:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is astonishing the way in which religiousness will come out; it even may in the singing of a hymn.<a name=325:8></a> I often used to wonder at that word to Timothy: " .<a name=325:9></a>.<a name=325:10></a>.<a name=325:11></a> put the brethren in remembrance of these things"; (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#4:6">1 Timothy  4:6</a>) it seemed to me astonishing that the apostle should need to warn against Romanism a church that held the very highest truth.<a name=325:12></a> But the very worst thing comes from spurious sanctity.<a name=325:13></a> Nothing does so much damage to the real thing as a counterfeit of it; it deludes souls into the belief that they have got the real thing.<a name=325:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now if a Colossian listened to the reading of this epistle, he would say: 'Is the apostle really so interested about us?<a name=325:15></a> The least thing then that we can do is to be interested about ourselves, and seek to understand what he has written to us'.<a name=325:16></a> And any here tonight who do not know it, I desire that you may lift up your heart to God and say, 'Teach it me'.<a name=325:17></a> As to any who do know, I am sure they desire to know more.<a name=325:18></a> For myself I feel every day how little I

	<div class="paragraph">
		really enter into it.<a name=326:1></a> It is a truth that will affect me in everything as I understand it.<a name=326:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we turn to the beginning of the epistle, we read: "We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you, since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have to all the saints".<a name=326:3></a> (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:3">Colossians  1:3</a> - 4) Now from this we should have thought the Colossians in such a good state that they would not require to be watched over with this great anxiety.<a name=326:4></a> But it is like a good physician, who might say, 'You are in very good health at the present moment, but still I am exceedingly anxious about you, for there is a terrible epidemic going, and I fear it for you'.<a name=326:5></a> God always deals with His people in this way; He gives us truth as preventive of evil.<a name=326:6></a> He gives us a summer before a winter, that we may be prepared for the dark days.<a name=326:7></a> That is.<a name=326:8></a> He gives us special truth to preserve us from a danger thus impending, just as God gave Elijah a double portion of food before his forty days' journey.<a name=326:9></a> Thus the Colossians were exposed to the snare; and as the apostle feared their falling into it, and wished to guard them from it, he opened out to them the truth of the mystery.<a name=326:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before passing on to this, I would first say a word on verse 23 of the first chapter.<a name=326:11></a> Here we find, as every student of Scripture knows, that there are two ministries: one, the ministry of the gospel; the other, the ministry of the church, which is the mystery.<a name=326:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, as to the ministry of the gospel.<a name=326:13></a> It is purely and entirely individual.<a name=326:14></a> On the other hand, that of the church is entirely corporate.<a name=326:15></a> Now if souls only go as far as the ministry of the gospel, they never reach the corporate thing at all.<a name=326:16></a> Christ is preached; the good tidings of salvation through His blood is proclaimed, all which Christ did for me.<a name=326:17></a> If I take David and Jonathan as an illustration of it, I find
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=327>[Page 327]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that Jonathan has received a most wonderful benefit.<a name=327:1></a> from the hand of David.<a name=327:2></a> He was in a state of fear until he saw the head of Goliath in the hand of David; but then he enjoys his saviour David, who has removed the cause of his fear.<a name=327:3></a> He is now set in the state of David.<a name=327:4></a> David's victory is his victory.<a name=327:5></a> To all intents and purposes he is as David.<a name=327:6></a> In type, "As he is, so are we in this world" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:17">1 John  4:17</a>) -- surely a state which cannot be surpassed.<a name=327:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I believe, and I speak it anxiously, that there is a lack in the way in which the gospel is preached.<a name=327:8></a> I delight at the way in which God blesses souls, but I feel that it is more the Goliath side that is known, than the David side, if I might so say.<a name=327:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now God's thought is to set up a soul in a divine contrast to the misery in the spot of his misery.<a name=327:10></a> Nothing can satisfy the heart of God, but that the soul shall be set up to His own satisfaction in the spot where it was in utmost misery.<a name=327:11></a> No language can convey it, no human tongue can tell it; but nothing can satisfy the heart of my Father in heaven but that I should be here, in this scene where everything tells the tale of my departure and distance from Him, in the very joy and blessing in which He is Himself.<a name=327:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Souls often understand grace without understanding <i>love</i>.<a name=327:13></a> I must say one word about love.<a name=327:14></a> Love delights in its object, and it must remove everything that bars it from its object.<a name=327:15></a> Now love as to natural beings goes out to what we call its 'ideal'.<a name=327:16></a> God too has His standard.<a name=327:17></a> He cannot find it in us, but we read that we shall be "conformed to the image of his Son".<a name=327:18></a> (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:29">Romans  8:29</a>) So that now we can say with the apostle "As he is, so are we in this world".<a name=327:19></a> (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:17">1 John  4:17</a>)
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		But in the gospel God has not only saved us from our fear, but He has placed us in power and blessedness in the very spot of our misery.<a name=328:2></a> See how He addresses the woman of Samaria.<a name=328:3></a> Does He say, 'When you get to heaven it will be all right with you?<a name=328:4></a>' No!<a name=328:5></a> but here in Samaria!<a name=328:6></a> <i>Here</i> you shall have a new character; here you shall go on in another way; here you shall be a new kind of person altogether; here you shall "never thirst"; here is the place in which "he that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water".<a name=328:7></a> (<a href="../bible/John.htm#7:38">John  7:38</a>) The Lord Himself was so delighted with the Father's work that He had done for this poor woman that when His disciples brought Him meat He could not eat.<a name=328:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now let us turn to <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>, to see how this body is constructed.<a name=331:2></a> We read: "For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.<a name=331:3></a> For by one Spirit are we all baptised into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit".<a name=331:4></a> (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:12">1 Corinthians  12:12</a> - 13) This is how it is formed.<a name=331:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I must here dwell for a moment on the fact that no one can understand the formation of the church unless he believes that the Holy Spirit is here residing on the earth, in the house of God.<a name=331:6></a> I do not think that people generally believe this, though they believe that the Holy Spirit is dwelling in believers <i>individually</i>.<a name=331:7></a> Now in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>we read that on the day of Pentecost He first filled <i>the house</i> where they were sitting, then He filled all those who were there also.<a name=331:8></a> When He had thus filled those who were sitting there, the house was not any the less filled, was it?<a name=331:9></a> Certainly not.<a name=331:10></a> It is the Holy Spirit who has come down from heaven who baptises all the members into one <i>body</i>.<a name=331:11></a> And it is just as easy for Him to connect a saint in Australia with me, as the one sitting next to me.<a name=331:12></a> You will never comprehend the formation of a body unless you believe in the ubiquity of the Spirit.<a name=331:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In reading <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#139">Psalm  139</a>, we find these two subjects in connection: "Whither shall I go from thy spirit?<a name=331:14></a> or whither shall I flee from thy presence?<a name=331:15></a> If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.<a name=331:16></a> If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me".<a name=331:17></a> (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#139:7">Psalm  139:7</a> - 10) We also have the formation

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is therefore evidently no geographical limit to the Spirit of God.<a name=332:2></a> It is no difficulty to the Holy Spirit to bind souls together, however remote from one another.<a name=332:3></a> Hence if "one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it".<a name=332:4></a> (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:26">1 Corinthians  12:26</a>) For instance, a man hurts his finger, and at once he stops walking and looks at it.<a name=332:5></a> He might as well have gone on walking, for his feet were not hurt.<a name=332:6></a> 'No', he says, 'but my <i>finger</i> is, and I cannot go on'.<a name=332:7></a> But, you argue, I cannot act to a brother in Australia as l can to one near to me.<a name=332:8></a> True; and therefore in Romans and Ephesians, where the brother near you is spoken of, he is called your neighbour.<a name=332:9></a> The man in Australia cannot be your <i>neighbour</i>, but he is none the less your <i>brother</i>.<a name=332:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Satan sought to extirpate Christ from the earth; but in the very place from whence He has been rejected are now found multitudes of saints to represent Him, baptised into one body by the Holy Spirit.<a name=332:11></a> Romanism has sought to give an exhibition of this unity by insisting on a liturgy which shall be the same and in one form and the same language all over the world.<a name=332:12></a> This was the work of the natural mind certainly; but there is no greater enemy to the church of God than the natural mind.<a name=332:13></a> So we find in Revelation that the direst enemy of Christ is that which is professedly the church of God.<a name=332:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Holy Spirit has two actions, upon earth.<a name=332:15></a> One is.<a name=332:16></a> He comforts the saints; the other is.<a name=332:17></a> He stands for Christ.<a name=332:18></a> And many know Him as the Comforter who know nothing of Him as the One who "shall testify of me".<a name=332:19></a> (<a href="../bible/John.htm#15:26">John  15:26</a>)

	<div class="paragraph">
		This is the whole point: not only has Christ done the greatest work for me, but He has put me also in the closest relationship to Himself.<a name=333:10></a> He is my Head.<a name=333:11></a> I cannot, then, use my own head; the blunders we make are all from using our own heads instead of following His guidance.<a name=333:12></a> As to the nature of the union the marriage tie falls short; it is a relationship that all types fall short of.<a name=333:13></a> I can only say that Scripture states it, and so I <i>believe</i> it.<a name=333:14></a> All the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are 'hid' in it.<a name=333:15></a> My hand writes something; you ask, 'How did you get that?<a name=333:16></a>' I answer, 'From my head'.<a name=333:17></a> What a wonderful thing it would be if we could say of everything we did, 'I got that from Christ; He alone is my Head'.<a name=333:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not believe we have the least conception of what a wonderful place we are set in; rivers of water flowing from us; not getting anything from this poor world, but, on the contrary, contributing to it (this individually), while corporately I participate in the wisdom, grace and glory of that blessed One who has brought me into this place on earth; for the glory of our corporate position is that what belongs to the Head belongs to each one of the members.<a name=333:19></a> As an individual I never enjoy anything until I have practical

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we turn to <a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#10">1 Kings  10</a>, we find a scripture which explains this.<a name=334:4></a> You remember that the queen of Sheba came all the way from her country to see king Solomon; and when she beheld all his riches, and glory, and magnificence, "there was no more spirit in her".<a name=334:5></a> (<a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#10:5">1 Kings  10:5</a>) Now I turn to this passage merely by way of <i>contrast;</i> and I ask what is the difference between the church's relation to Christ, and the queen of Sheba's relation to Solomon?<a name=334:6></a> The queen of Sheba was there only as a spectator; she was so entranced with all she saw that there was no more spirit left in her.<a name=334:7></a> But does that convey to us the church's position?<a name=334:8></a> No; the church is a <i>participator</i>, not a spectator.<a name=334:9></a> If the queen of Sheba could have understood that she was allied to Solomon as closely as his own body to his head, do you think she would ever have gone away from Jerusalem?<a name=334:10></a> Certainly not.<a name=334:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus I get a test by which to discover whether a person really knows the mystery.<a name=334:12></a> If they know what it is to be members of the body of Christ, they are satisfied with nothing short of Christ's place.<a name=334:13></a> The church can have no other place but where Christ is.<a name=334:14></a> A person sees the mystery if he sees that he can have his joys, his pleasures, in no other place but where the Head is.<a name=334:15></a> God has made us complete in Him who is the head of all principality and power.<a name=334:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So that in dealing with a soul I first seek to portray to him the greatness of God's grace in putting a sinner in a place of freedom from all fear, of salvation from his enemy; and, when he is clear as to that, I tell him that he is a member of the body of Christ.<a name=334:17></a> He thus not only rejoices in His work, but he participates in all that He is.<a name=334:18></a>

		One word more.<a name=334:19></a> Practice corroborates even a divine theory; therefore, if what I have stated is the

	<div class="paragraph">
		truth, the practice will confirm it.<a name=335:1></a> Now we find the practice in chapter 3.<a name=335:2></a> First, we are to set our minds "on things above, not on things on the earth".<a name=335:3></a> (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3:2">Colossians  3:2</a>) It does not say in the <i>world</i>, many a man is earthly who is not worldly.<a name=335:4></a> The earth is in contrast to heaven; the world, to the Father.<a name=335:5></a> And then we read farther on, "Christ is all and In all".<a name=335:6></a> (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3:11">Colossians  3:11</a>) Christ is <i>all</i>, He is everything; it does not leave room for <i>anything</i> else.<a name=335:7></a> Then, I say, this truth as to the mystery would affect my life in everything.<a name=335:8></a> For instance I might write a letter rather sharply, and then ask myself, 'Would the Lord write that letter?<a name=335:9></a>' If not, then do not send it.<a name=335:10></a> We have a Head in heaven, who would use us just as we use our hand.<a name=335:11></a>

		Lastly: ".<a name=335:12></a>Whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus".<a name=335:13></a> (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3:17">Colossians  3:17</a>) I believe that is the testimony -- to do everything in His name.<a name=335:14></a> Nothing ought to be more delightful to us.<a name=335:15></a> Just as any affectionate husband or wife would say, 'You need not <i>tell</i> me to do such or such a thing; I <i>delight</i> to'.<a name=335:16></a> Do everything in His name: our furniture, our dress, no matter what it is.<a name=335:17></a> I am delighted that He has not imposed anything less upon me.<a name=335:18></a> I know that nothing can carry such virtue and blessedness with it as doing everything in His name.<a name=335:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I can only add, that I do not know anything that has had a more vivifying effect on my own heart than the fact that the Lord has an object of delight and interest and love upon this earth, and that He has called us to share His interest and delight and joy in it.<a name=335:20></a>
