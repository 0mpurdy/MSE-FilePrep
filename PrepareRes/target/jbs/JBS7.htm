		In all dispensations, the people of God were practically sustained by hope.<a name=1:1></a> Though the hope might be different in all, yet its power, as a principle of action, was similar in all; and if we study the mode by which we are led along from one pursuit to another, and are sedulous in any, it is simply from hope.<a name=1:2></a> You enter on the drudgery of learning a language with the hope of being able to understand it; you sow your field with the hope of enjoying the fruits of it; and thus also in the details of life, there is always something in the distance which buoys up the spirit and encourages you to advance.<a name=1:3></a> It is the principle which begets all enterprise and is always active in a man, and never satisfied till shown by the Spirit of God what eye hath not seen nor ear heard.<a name=1:4></a> No present blessing has ever shut out hope.<a name=1:5></a> There is always, at all times, to the man of God something better beyond, and, if his mind fed not on it, things around unduly engaged him, to the prejudice of what was more blessed.<a name=1:6></a> Man is engrossed by some hope, and the nature of the hope gives him character.<a name=1:7></a> If christians are not led on by their proper hope, there must be failure in their service, as well as in personal blessing; for they are taken up with some other hope which distracts them, and prevents them from being engaged with their proper one.<a name=1:8></a> This, I believe, has been the cause of the church's great departure from its proper character and path on earth.<a name=1:9></a> Abraham looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.<a name=1:10></a> This hope did not save him (that is to say, if thereby be meant the remission of sins), but it made him turn his back on the stately structure of Babel, in the land of Shinar, for the city of God, which glistened in the

		I fear the church has been looking for conversions and earthly extension, and the like, instead of that hope which, like a beacon-light, would not only encourage it to advance, but also guide it in its course.<a name=2:9></a> How seldom have christians examined into the nature of the place God has set the church in here below!<a name=2:10></a> Are we Jews?<a name=2:11></a> certainly not.<a name=2:12></a> Are we gentiles?<a name=2:13></a> Through God's grace, we answer, No!<a name=2:14></a> We are of the church of God.<a name=2:15></a> The Jews are displaced.<a name=2:16></a> Israel is <i>broken off</i> that we might be grafted in, and here is our earthly place; but the question occurs, 'How did we come there'?<a name=2:17></a> We were strangers to the covenant of promise.<a name=2:18></a> I believe the gospel of Luke is especially written to show us how God was preparing to disclose the mystery of the church.<a name=2:19></a> The language of Simeon is different from that of Hezekiah: earth is nothing to one as soon as Christ is seen, and he longs to depart.<a name=2:20></a> The prodigal son does not, on his reformation, get another living, but he gets a higher thing - even the father's house and the glories of it; also Lazarus in Abraham's bosom, for one who had been in no earthly blessings whatsoever; and, lastly, paradise opened out to Christ's last companion in this earth, too bad for the men of this world, the first to be with Christ in heaven!<a name=2:21></a> As a Jew, he asked to be remembered in

		God made the last trial of Israel when He sent His Son.<a name=3:2></a> In His cry, every offer should be made to them.<a name=3:3></a> Hence, even the apostles were not instructed as to the destiny of the nation; their hopes were Jewish, and all their early ministration was to Jews.<a name=3:4></a> The stoning of Stephen, the witness of the Holy Spirit resisted, gave the grand blow to Jewish things.<a name=3:5></a> Samaria then hears the word of God and, stranger still, an Ethiopian eunuch, as he "<i>was returning</i>" from Jerusalem, is owned and received.<a name=3:6></a> Notwithstanding, the apostles were not prepared for the entrance of the gentiles into the root and fatness of the olive tree.<a name=3:7></a> The natural branches we see are broken off, and God is now about to bring in the gentiles.<a name=3:8></a> This is detailed in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10">Acts  10</a>to Peter in a vision.<a name=3:9></a> He is shown a sheet knit at four corners, as comprising the whole world, in which were all manner of beasts (clean and unclean).<a name=3:10></a> It came out of heaven, and was let down on the earth, and was received up again into heaven.<a name=3:11></a> All these minutia are important, as instructing us in the characteristics of the new body about to take the place of testimony on earth.<a name=3:12></a> They were to be distinctly heavenly in origin and heavenly in hope: they came from heaven, they reached earth, but they returned to heaven.<a name=3:13></a> True, they were to fill up the hiatus caused by the breaking off of Israel and this only for a season, as we see in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11">Romans  11</a>.<a name=3:14></a> The error which has seduced the church into the world, was the idea that it was to take the place of Israel in respect to hope as well as in respect of testimony.<a name=3:15></a> Now, Palestine was never given to the gentile, and it alone God had claimed in a peculiar manner, but yielded into the hands of the gentile king when His people ceased to be witness for Him in it.<a name=3:16></a> The great power given over the wide earth to the gentile is not yet reassumed, because He,

		whose right it is, has not yet come.<a name=4:1></a> He is gone to seek for Himself a kingdom, but is not as yet returned, and until then <i>no portion</i> of earth could be claimed by the church now.<a name=4:2></a> Hence, the place given to them is in heaven: like the prodigal, it is to the Father's house and glories they are called.<a name=4:3></a> The word is ".<a name=4:4></a>.<a name=4:5></a> .<a name=4:6></a> blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ".<a name=4:7></a> Man on earth had dishonoured God, and it had been cursed on his account; and the man who, like Cain, attempts to make it a scene pleasing to God, not only subjects himself to bitter disappointment, but his spirit must be opposed to godliness.<a name=4:8></a> Man on earth has been tried: Jew and gentile, all are found wanting.<a name=4:9></a> He who is Lord of heaven and earth tarries for a little season ere He shows Himself as King of kings and Lord of lords; and during that season He is gathering out a people for His name, and heaven is His locality, for earth is yet unsubdued.<a name=4:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I am insisting on this point especially, because if we know not our present calling, we must be ignorant of the hope to which we are saved, simply because if our proper hope engaged us, it would put us in our proper place here.<a name=4:11></a> If I am actually now a heavenly man as to calling, and if all saints are so, my eye must rest on them as such, and my hope is not connected with earth or earthly things.<a name=4:12></a> The hope of a man now, holding citizenship in heaven, is to look for the Saviour who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like His own glorious body; <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3">Philippians  3</a>.<a name=4:13></a> This is the first work of Christ on His return, and hence it is the hope of the saints, and it purifies them; <a href="../bible/1John.htm#3">1 John  3</a>.<a name=4:14></a> Christ is raised; then they that are His at His coming.<a name=4:15></a> He will manifest the sons of God.<a name=4:16></a> He will show the triumph over death in the thousands of His saints.<a name=4:17></a> Enoch, the seventh from Adam, the first in whom was arrested the power of death, at one and the same time gave Satan a presage of his final

		Thus it is we see that ascertaining my place now has much to do with my hope.<a name=5:11></a> If I am not looking to earth at all for blessing, but offering blessing to men on it from heaven, then I am not looking towards earth, but looking from heaven towards its Lord; and thus is the argument of the apostle in <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3">Philippians  3</a>.<a name=5:12></a> He says there are certain persons "enemies of the cross of Christ"; and the summing up of their character is, that they mind "earthly things".<a name=5:13></a> Christ has quickened us with Himself above all these - not delivered by Him to be again immersed in them, but risen with Him with our affections set on things above, not on earthly things.<a name=5:14></a> These are still the theatre where Satan acts, and they that set their minds on them are enemies to the cross of Christ.<a name=5:15></a> The spirit of Cain is

		This portion of Scripture contains two subjects, the one mainly affecting the christian himself, the other affecting the body of Christ through him.<a name=7:1></a> In fact, the deep interests of the church of God for one member, and all, are unfolded in this passage.<a name=7:2></a> Hence we can understand the emphatic manner with which the apostle presses them on the children of God.<a name=7:3></a> He beseeches them not as the apostle or the prophet, but as the prisoner of Jesus Christ; as one in whom was realised practically the fruitlessness of all earthly expectancy; a witness of what faithfulness to Christ in the world must suffer; and as one for whom the termination of earthly scenes would be a release and rest.<a name=7:4></a> Such is the character to give emphasis to the appeal he now makes to all saints.<a name=7:5></a> And, as such, he beseeches them to walk worthy of their vocation wherewith they are called.<a name=7:6></a> He had, in the preceding chapter of this epistle, opened out the nature and blessing of their vocation, and therefore, in this passage, he addresses the church as understanding it.<a name=7:7></a> It is evident that if one is ignorant of the nature and principles of his calling, he cannot walk worthy of it; a servant may be willing and obedient, yet he cannot fulfil the duties of his service unless he knows them; and, consequently, in every case in Scripture, we learn that our gracious God always establishes His servant in the practical blessing of his service ere he enters on it.<a name=7:8></a> Doubtless service deepens it, but the truth I am called to exhibit is my own strength and guide in the work, so that "he that watereth is watered also himself".<a name=7:9></a>

		Moses learned in the burning bush (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#3">Exodus  3</a>), the power and unchanging faithfulness of Jehovah to manifest Himself amidst the frail, contradictory things of earth, in wrath remembering mercy; and this scene sustained and instructed him in all his course, while conducting Israel from the iron rule of Pharaoh to the mount of Pisgah, where He should bequeath "the good will of him that dwelt in the bush" (<a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#33:16">Deuteronomy  33:16</a>), as one who had largely experienced it.<a name=8:3></a> To Joshua (chapter 5) again, the captain, rather than the apostle of the Jewish calling, there appeared, with a drawn sword, the prince of the host of the Lord.<a name=8:4></a> Each had a vision suitable to, and characteristic of, his own peculiar mission.<a name=8:5></a> So, a live coal from the altar, in the circle of the ever holy glory, and the presence of the King, the Lord of hosts, touching the lips of Isaiah, not only set his heart ready for service but gave strength to him, and guidance in all the details of it.<a name=8:6></a> The nature and principles of that scene were embodied in all his testimony.<a name=8:7></a> The holiness and glory of the Lord, the uncleanness of His people, the purging of a remnant, judicial blindness of the mass, and the preservation and return of holy seed, were all comprised within the vision of chapter 6.<a name=8:8></a>

		These examples will suffice to establish the necessity (if any should doubt it) of being truly and accurately instructed in the nature and principles of our calling, if we really desire to walk worthy of it, and that we readily will not, is not only evident practically, but from the marked manner in which the apostle presses it upon us.<a name=9:11></a> He knew, the Spirit knew, the many hindrances which arise to our walking worthily of our calling.<a name=9:12></a> But why no effort, desire, or response to this touching appeal of our apostle?<a name=9:13></a> Do we know, in any energy, the nature of our calling?<a name=9:14></a> Have we patiently, like Mary at the feet of Jesus, sought from the Word the momentous meaning of our calling?<a name=9:15></a> Has every christian by the unction of the Holy Spirit sought after a faithfully desired acquaintance with a subject so earnestly put before us?<a name=9:16></a> Or, are we content with the ignorance of Thomas (<a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>) on a kindred and connected subject: "We know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?<a name=9:17></a>" I have said already, that the apostle, in the preceding chapters, gives a full and clear detail of our vocation, and as it must be first known ere practical effects follow from it, it may be well to ponder a little on it.<a name=9:18></a>

		First, let us enquire whether our vocation, as taught in this epistle, is a new revelation, and demanding a new and peculiar path on earth; or such as all, in God's line of witnesses, from the creation to the cross, had known, enjoyed, and walked in.<a name=10:1></a>

		When we have it once a settled axiom before our souls, that God has been always, though in very different and even opposite ways, unfolding the various rays of His own glory, at one time His creative wisdom, at another His power and government; here, as a righteous Ruler, who guards and exhorts a peculiar nation on earth, and there, as a Father who seeks sinners in electing, though indiscriminate, grace for heaven: when this is simply and clearly seen, it follows as a consequence that the calling and walk of believers are modified, moulded, and governed by these respective revelations of God's character.<a name=10:2></a>

		I believe each and all of God's people, in every age, knew that all their springs were in Him, knew that His loving kindness was better than life itself, and that in His presence was fulness of joy, and at His right hand pleasures for evermore.<a name=10:3></a> They reckoned their blessings to flow from Him, and the power, and in whatsoever place He would be, there would be glory, unspeakable glory to them; and, therefore, it does not interfere with their enjoyment, rest and blessing, whether their hope reached forward to the epiphany of Christ in glory on the earth (of which we have many proofs), or to the simply heavenly glory and the full blessedness of the church as the bride of Christ.<a name=10:4></a> Of this latter we have no intimation, save such passages as "heavenly" country, and "a city", in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11">Hebrews  11</a>, be supposed to bear that meaning.<a name=10:5></a>

		Let us, therefore, enquire into the value and importance of assembling together.<a name=25:2></a> The church is constitutionally an assembly, as the word in the Greek (<i>ekklesia</i>) denotes; and if there be no assembling together, there would be no composition of the church <i>here</i>.<a name=25:3></a> There is no question but that the Holy Spirit sets all the living members of Christ in Him in heavenly places; but also, He fashions us for our place there by varied exercises here.<a name=25:4></a> After we have suffered a while, He perfects or matures us.<a name=25:5></a> Here the talent is to be put to usury.<a name=25:6></a> How, <i>where</i>, and in whom death and the power of Satan were dominant, must life and the power of Christ be manifested; and this not by one witness, but by many, in one strict unbroken testimony, which was at first exhibited, and produced such blessed results; 'the people magnified them'; the power of evil was suppressed and overawed for a moment.<a name=25:7></a> But though that may be passed, yet by the church <i>now</i> the manifold wisdom of God is learned by the powers and principalities in heavenly places.<a name=25:8></a> I err much if I consider myself individually apart from the family of God.<a name=25:9></a> All saints <i>now</i> are baptised by one Spirit into one body.<a name=25:10></a> The moment I become alive to the glory of my position in the body of Christ, I seek not the desert, like John the baptist, taking a position peculiar and uncongenial to all, but, like the regenerate Saul of Tarsus, I assay to join myself to the disciples.<a name=25:11></a> Vitality demands sympathy.<a name=25:12></a> Relationship, even without acquaintance, has its charms and its claims.<a name=25:13></a> In nature, a brother I had never seen has a ready passport to my affections.<a name=25:14></a> The church I am in is not one member but many, and, as in our natural body, power redounds from the harmonious adjustment of all the members, and from the happy consent of each to its peculiar office, so is it in the spiritual body; and the readiness of a member to engage or return to its place,

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, then, the principles of life draw us together.<a name=26:2></a> There is an immediate and necessary impulse, to be in association with saints, for our life, and power, and joy, are identical.<a name=26:3></a> But more than this - our benefits are contingent on one another.<a name=26:4></a> I am not only impelled to association from the power of a common life, but I find that in this association the varied powers of usefulness of the members towards one another are alone evolved.<a name=26:5></a> I cannot merely feel that I must associate with saints (which must be so, and could not be otherwise if I have <i>any energy</i> of life) but that my place is to receive blessing as well as to impart any.<a name=26:6></a> To every member there is given a gift of grace (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4">Ephesians  4</a>), not so much for himself but in his relation to the church "for perfecting of the saints.<a name=26:7></a>" Where, then, can he exercise this gift, or be profited by another, but in or towards the assembly?<a name=26:8></a> If I sanction individuality, or even partition or multiplied sections, I must undervalue the gifts and services, through them, of those from whom I license myself to be absent.<a name=26:9></a> In the first enunciation of the church, the blessing of Christ's presence rests on two or three meeting together in His name.<a name=26:10></a> Now, those who argue for individuality or practise it, either disbelieve this or undervalue it - either bad enough.<a name=26:11></a> But it is with His gifts through the Holy Spirit His presence is known, so that even the unlearned may acknowledge that God is in you.<a name=26:12></a> He now is the messenger of Christ, the gift of the Father, giving power to one after this manner, and to another after that, to perfect the church unto the stature of Christ, of gifts for the perfecting of the saints.<a name=26:13></a> I shall not particularise any; but if gifts for this especial purpose are denied, then there must, as a necessary

		Thus, then, if I depreciate the assembling together of the saints, I am disregarding the warning of the apostle, proving my little sympathy with the members of Christ's body; decrying, or at least undervaluing, the gifts for edification bestowed on the assembly, whereby the presence of Christ is known amongst them not only thus injuring myself, but also an injury to the church, for they lose my services; and, finally, I am unhesitatingly declaring that my spirit little blends in happy fellowship with saints around the throne, when I am so indifferent to them, and they so unattractive to me down here.<a name=28:1></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		On the other hand, let us enumerate the blessings of assembling together.<a name=28:2></a> I am obedient to the word of the Lord, and obedience is greater than sacrifice, for it is the yielding of myself to His will.<a name=28:3></a> If Thomas had not absented himself from the first meeting of the disciples, he would not have been eight days behind the rest of the apostles in faith and knowledge.<a name=28:4></a> I am seeking the place where Christ meets with His people.<a name=28:5></a> At the supper table (<a href="../bible/John.htm#13:14">John  13:14</a>) He opened out the treasures of His grace to His disciples - the church in type - and where now, by His servants He edifies, exhorts, and comforts His saints, for that assembly is the proper sphere of the gifts of His grace; <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14">1 Corinthians  14</a>.<a name=28:6></a> I am joining with many witnesses to show forth His death till <i>He comes</i>; and the very act of my going to "one place" in company with others, is not only an evidence of my own appreciation of Christ in contrast to all around, but I am an example to others to do likewise.<a name=28:7></a> I go to feast, as well as to present myself before the Lord.<a name=28:8></a> Lastly, the more my heart rises into the glorious scene of the family group around the throne - ever praising, ever exulting in the Lamb that was slain, and yearning to take my place there - the more shall I value every even faint shadowing of it in this wilderness of sin and sorrow.<a name=28:9></a>

		The history of the Ephesian saints, from the darkness of nature up to the height of glory, and rest, apportioned by God's grace to the members of Christ's body, is evidently instructive to us, in order that we may ascertain how far we have consciously advanced in the same blessed path.<a name=30:1></a> We read in the end of <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#18">Acts  18</a>that the apostle Paul had preached in the synagogue at Ephesus and subsequently that Apollos came to Ephesus, and he spoke and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.<a name=30:2></a> That the saints in Ephesus had advanced no farther than John's baptism is evident from chapter 19.<a name=30:3></a> Then we read the apostle again visits Ephesus and finds certain disciples, whose progress he ascertains by asking them, "Have ye received the Holy Spirit?<a name=30:4></a>" to which they replied, "We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Spirit".<a name=30:5></a> The apostle then traces their ignorance to the limited nature of their faith and profession by a second question "Unto what then were ye baptised?<a name=30:6></a> And they said, Unto John's baptism".<a name=30:7></a> Now we must remember that the things of the Lord can be taught diligently, knowing only the baptism of John, and that saints can be disciples and not have heard even whether there be any Holy Spirit (I suppose not simply hearing but understanding), ere we can form any just idea of the state of soul such limited acquaintance with the work of Christ must entail.<a name=30:8></a> John's testimony went no further than declaring the coming of one mightier than he, awakening consciences to the ruin of their condition, demanding of them to bring forth fruits meet for repentance, calling on them to repent, for God's reign was commencing and judgment was concomitant with it, but giving man no

	<div class="paragraph">
		May we not fear that many disciples of the Lord even now have not advanced practically beyond the <i>doctrines</i> taught in the testimony of John the baptist?<a name=31:5></a> How many know nothing, at least almost nothing, of the forgiveness of sins, and as possessors of a new life and nature, accepted of God in all the excellence of the Beloved!<a name=31:6></a> If not, surely they too might answer, "we have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Spirit" - at least <i>instructively</i> so.<a name=31:7></a> But at this let them not be cast down, for such-like were the Ephesian saints, and yet after they believed they were sealed with "that Holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance".<a name=31:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now it is as sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise that the apostle proceeds to instruct the saints of Ephesus into all the glory of their calling.<a name=31:9></a> He first prays that the eyes of their understanding may be enlightened that they may know what is the hope of His calling, what is the glory of His inheritance in the saints, and what is the exceeding greatness of His power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of His mighty power which He wrought in Christ,

		The attentive reader of the <a href="../bible/Revelation(chapters.htm#14:19">Revelation (chapters  14:19</a>) must be led to enquire the meaning of a term such as 'Babylon,' used without any interpretation annexed, and yet so connected with the sense that, unless it be ascertained, there can be no understanding of the subject matter.<a name=39:1></a> To the christian student, there is one simple rule in such enquiries, that the Scriptures can alone explain the difficulties of the Scriptures.<a name=39:2></a> This necessarily must be so, for by them a man can be "thoroughly furnished unto <i>all</i> good works", and consequently anything from without is superfluous.<a name=39:3></a> Moreover, the attempt disparages the sufficiency of Scripture, and exposes the mind, guilty of such contempt, to be carried away by false unscriptural glosses of ancient or modern tradition.<a name=39:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		To arrive, then, correctly at the ideas the word 'Babylon' embodies, and to convey how it is used by the Holy Spirit, it will be necessary to gather from Scripture its characteristics, and how it first came to be the centre or symbol of principles which were to be so largely dominant.<a name=39:5></a> Constantly, in Scripture, we find that either a person or place, which is about to occupy a prominent position in the development of God's purposes, is distinguished at its first notice with the traits and lines of the unmistakable qualities which maturity will disclose, be they for good or evil; so that old age is only a return in a matured and concentrated form to the first and simplest efforts of childhood.<a name=39:6></a> Thus, in the first notice we have of David, we find the elements of the shepherd, who would "feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance".<a name=39:7></a> We see the same as to evil in Amalek.<a name=39:8></a> With the self-same

	<div class="paragraph">
		Accordingly, I think we are justified in looking for the embryo characteristics which Babylon embodies at its first introduction to us, or, as we might say, at its birth.<a name=40:2></a> In <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#10:10">Genesis  10:10</a>, we are told that the beginning of Nimrod's kingdom was Babylon and surely his cities were designed in the same spirit which actuated himself.<a name=40:3></a> He was "a mighty one in the earth", a man confident in his own resources, and daring in the presence of the Lord to pursue, in the proud eagerness of his own strength, wherever his pleasure or profit, as in the chase, might lead him.<a name=40:4></a> The irresistible excitement which bears the huntsman along in his course aptly depicts the spirit in which the world seeks the attainment of its desires.<a name=40:5></a> Both are intoxicated with their purpose and doubtless a city with such a founder must only have been a wider sphere for fuller display of his principles and tastes, even as much as the materials for it were increased; and all still "before the Lord".<a name=40:6></a> This shows that there was religiousness assumed, together with the most open avowal of human selfishness and lust.<a name=40:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Still further are we instructed in the spirit and constitution of this city in chapter 11, where the name Babel, or Babylon, is given it in consequence of a full-blown manifestation of its founder's principles.<a name=40:8></a> Here we learn that man's confidence in himself had reached such a height, that they forgot even the expression of acknowledgment of God, and endeavoured to establish themselves independently of Him.<a name=40:9></a> God then confounded their attempt, and hence arose the name Babel (confusion), which men have retained without remembering its etymology.<a name=40:10></a> The building is discontinued, not thrown down - the builders scattered,

		Until <a href="../bible/2Kings.htm#17">2 Kings  17</a>, there is no direct record in Scripture of such a place, for the word translated 'Babylonish,' as designating the garment abstracted by Achan from the spoils of Jericho, is Shinar, not properly Babylon, though of the country in which the city stood; and even this is far from militating against what I have asserted, namely, that Babylon only appears as the apostasy of Israel appears.<a name=41:6></a> Therefore, as the leaven of it was working in Achan, it is not wonderful to find there the shade of the forthcoming evil.<a name=41:7></a> But, in <a href="../bible/2Kings.htm#17:24">2 Kings  17:24</a> - 30, after a long interval and in connection with the captivity of the ten tribes,

		Now, bearing in mind this hasty glance at the ideas which the word 'Babylon' in Scripture evokes, let us turn to the Revelation and see whether it corroborates what has been seen.<a name=50:6></a> In <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#14">Revelation  14</a>we are told that "Babylon is fallen, is fallen", as if the fate of it was pregnant with great and untold advantages to a harassed and suffering people; the Jewish remnant doubtless, because we must ever keep Israel and Babylon in antagonistic positions, the glory of one depending on the downfall of the other.<a name=50:7></a> And in this chapter we have the hundred and forty-four thousand catching up the heavenly anthem and consequently the doom of the earthly usurper is announced contemporaneously; for when the earthly family are in unison with the heavenly, then the hostile power must be judged and condemned.<a name=50:8></a> In chapters 17 and 18 we are still further instructed as to the course of evil which will eventuate in the direful form which Babylon represents.<a name=50:9></a> The relations of the ecclesiastical and civil forms of power are described in these chapters - christendom's declension to its ultimate immersion in the principles of Babylon.<a name=50:10></a> And what is Babylon here?<a name=50:11></a> She is arrayed in purple and scarlet, she is bedizened with gold and precious stones, far, far different from the modest apparel which

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the Bible only is the full nature of man's ruin exposed and depicted; and there only is a perfect remedy - God's remedy - revealed.<a name=53:1></a> If there be any limitation of the extent and depth of the ruin, there must be a still greater misapprehension of the remedy, because the remedy is not merely equal to the measure of the ruin, but, as the remedy is the gift of grace through our Lord Jesus Christ, it must from the mere fact of its source be divine, and far beyond the expectation or sensible requirement of man.<a name=53:2></a> It must be magnificent in every part.<a name=53:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Yet the remedy, however great, cannot be appreciated unless the need of it be felt.<a name=53:4></a> Hence the need of man because of his ruin must be the first sense, in some measure, in the awakened soul: "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom"; the awakening of the soul necessarily discloses to it its danger and its misery.<a name=53:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When the extent of the ruin is before the mind of the evangelist, when his heart is yearning for the good of souls, he would feel himself straitened and incapable did he not know that the remedy could in every detail meet the misery before him.<a name=53:6></a> If he see only a part of the misery, he contents himself with offering to and pressing on the sinner that portion of the remedy which will relieve that part.<a name=53:7></a> Hence the preacher must know the ruin not partially, for then he will present the remedy only partially.<a name=53:8></a> And very often the remedy known partially is, in the mind of the evangelist, that which indicates the ruin, instead of a knowledge of the ruin leading him to ascertain the divine remedy.<a name=53:9></a> It is when I am aware of the ruin that I look for the remedy; and, on the other hand, when I have true

		Let us take some examples of this in Scripture.<a name=54:2></a> There the remedy in divine measure covers the ruin.<a name=54:3></a> The famished prodigal son is not only kissed and clothed, but he is feasted in the father's house.<a name=54:4></a> The evangelist must either leave him "a great way off", where the Father kisses him; or he must set him in the Father's house, <i>beginning</i> to be merry.<a name=54:5></a> Has his ruin been relieved - has the remedy reached the full measure of the ruin and the need, until he is in the Father's house?<a name=54:6></a> One might say he was safe from judgment when the Father had kissed him; reconciliation had been effected; the terrible distance between God and the sinner had been crossed by the love that had found a ransom; but the prodigal's ruin requires much more.<a name=54:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The question is, Am I at liberty to propose to a prodigal part of the divine remedy and withhold the rest?<a name=54:8></a>

		Every convert may not enjoy the greatness or perfection of the remedy, yet it is important to assure every perishing soul of the full nature and scope of the remedy, so that he may be convinced, at least, that there is no limitation on the part of God, though he have not faith to grasp it.<a name=57:13></a> There is a vast difference between the state of the soul of the one who, though converted, never heard of the fulness of the remedy as set forth in these parables, and the one who, though he have heard it, has not sensibly entered into it.<a name=57:14></a> In the former there is no exercised conscience; there is no sense of failure, because not enjoying what has been conferred upon him; but there is a sense of lack continually - a feeling of wanting something to render

		The first thing to be assured of, in order to understand sanctification practically, is that we are, on believing, sanctified to God "By which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:10">Hebrews  10:10</a>.<a name=59:1></a> "Both he that sanctifies and those sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren", <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:11">Hebrews  2:11</a>.<a name=59:2></a> If a believer died the moment after he believed, like the thief on the cross, he is sanctified and fit for the paradise of God, because in the act of death he would have been divested of all the old thing, and nothing could go into paradise but the new, and nothing else will at any time (no matter how long a believer may live here) go into paradise but what is new - what is of God.<a name=59:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When a believer is quickened he is born of God, and this is sanctification of the Spirit.<a name=59:4></a> But when he remains here, surrounded by the flesh, he learns practical sanctification.<a name=59:5></a> If he had died on believing, he would have been divested of all the graveclothes, but as he remains in the body he has to learn practically what it is to be divested of the influence of the old things, and to walk in the midst of them in the grace and Spirit of Christ; and, as he does, he is sanctified practically.<a name=59:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now before there can be any step in, or knowledge of, practical sanctification, there must be a knowledge of what holiness really is.<a name=59:7></a> If a believer does not know what holiness is, he is like one looking for a thing of which he knows nothing at all - like a blind man trying to comprehend light before he can see.<a name=59:8></a> I cannot know any sentiment until I have been affected by it, hence

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the work of Christ <i>lands</i> the believer in "the holiest of all".<a name=60:3></a> He is rescued from death and judgment, brought from the deepest and darkest distance in one step, through His work, into the brightest place - "the holiest of all".<a name=60:4></a> We have boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus.<a name=60:5></a> That blood certifies the believer's title to be there, and his place is there for ever.<a name=60:6></a> There only can he acquire a sense of holiness - of that separation from all defilement which suits God.<a name=60:7></a> As God's own righteousness only suits Him as to conduct, so His own holiness only suits Him as to associations.<a name=60:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The believer has not entered into it, has not tasted of the true effect of Christ's work for him, if he has not entered into the holiest of all.<a name=60:9></a> True, many quickened souls do not enjoy the holiest of all, and very often they try to be holy in order that they may reach an assured resting-place before God.<a name=60:10></a> The fact is, like the prodigal, their very approximation to God in the sense of His love in receiving them, only awakens in them the sense of their unfitness to be near.<a name=60:11></a> They would fain brush up the old clothes, instead of seeing that they, the old things, are passed away, and that in new things only can they be really at ease in the Father's house.<a name=60:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus it is as divested of an evil conscience, and by the separating power of the word cleansed from our own surroundings that we draw near, the heart sprinkled from an evil conscience and the body washed with pure water.<a name=60:13></a> It is here the believer first acquires the sense of holiness.<a name=60:14></a> An entirely new sense to him, and one which is wholly unique, even as no art of the apothecary could compound anything like unto the holy anointing oil.<a name=60:15></a>

		Many are led away by a spurious article because they do not know the genuine one.<a name=61:1></a> Thus Romanism beguiles many a one by propounding a severe self-mortification for holiness.<a name=61:2></a> When the believer has once tasted of holiness, what it only is, he must be aware of what is contrary to it; and when he has left his place in the holiest.<a name=61:3></a> I can never lose my place in the holiest, Christ's blood has obtained it for me.<a name=61:4></a> I do, alas!<a name=61:5></a> constantly lose my enjoyment in it.<a name=61:6></a> But the place remains mine, as David's place at the king's table remained his though he did not occupy it.<a name=61:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, when my place in the holiest is assured to me and holiness is known to me, if I had no connection with the flesh and the world, there would be no departure from it; but seeing that I am in a body of sin, and that I am constantly liable to defilement and consequent deprivation of the enjoyment of the holiest, I should be unable to recover my place were it not for the Lord's present ministry washing my feet.<a name=61:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This blessed ministry is to restore me to a place that I have already enjoyed.<a name=61:9></a> When I am defiled I cannot resume my place in the holiest until my feet are washed.<a name=61:10></a> If I have never enjoyed my place in the holiest, even though my conscience is distressed because of my failure, I have not the feeling that I am deprived of it, because I could not feel that I had lost anything which I had never enjoyed.<a name=61:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the washing of the feet sets forth the great principle of sanctification.<a name=61:12></a> It is not merely a confession of the error and thus a removal of it.<a name=61:13></a> At conversion all our sins were forgiven, as they affected us in the eye of God: being forgiven we were sanctified; we belong to God in the holiest through Christ's work; any sin committed after conversion is a return to the flesh.<a name=61:14></a> But the flesh has been judicially terminated in the cross, and if not judged by the believer must be judged by the Lord: "Our God is a consuming fire".<a name=61:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in order to promote the growth effectually, the Lord adds: "I sanctify myself for them, that they also may be sanctified by truth".<a name=63:11></a> The heart of the believer drawn away from the things here to Christ where He is, would be practically dissociated from the hindering influence here; setting the mind on things above and not on things on the earth.<a name=63:12></a> The more I am of the divine order, the more I should be distanced from the men of the world; and the more my heart is drawn away out of everything after Him who had left everything here, the more detached I should be from the things on the earth and the scene of them.<a name=63:13></a> For practical sanctification I require both to know that I am of a new generation among the old, as a butterfly among caterpillars; and I require to be removed from the <i>leaves</i> on which caterpillars feed, in order that my old tastes should not be ministered to, and I should

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Finally, there are two ministries by which it is promoted.<a name=64:3></a> One is the word, <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:26">Ephesians  5:26</a>, "That he might sanctify it, purifying it by the washing of water by the word".<a name=64:4></a> The other is discipline, <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:10">Hebrews  12:10</a>: "In order to the partaking of his holiness".<a name=64:5></a> Now these two ministries work hand in hand, one inside, the other outside.<a name=64:6></a> I do not speak of the chastening here for the works of the flesh; doubtless that is to silence the root that has not been judged.<a name=64:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is then the ministry of the word by which the Lord leads our hearts into such enjoyment with His glories and interests as the queen of Sheba had with Solomon, so that there is no spirit left in us.<a name=64:8></a> There is a sensible dropping off of the old things.<a name=64:9></a> To God I am outside myself, so that things once thought indispensable and fascinating are now superseded.<a name=64:10></a> The graveclothes are for the moment gone, and I breathe freely in a holy atmosphere.<a name=64:11></a> The wonder and beauty of His mind and thoughts quite surpass the small selfish enjoyments of my poor heart.<a name=64:12></a> I am drawn nearer to Him; and the nearer I am, the more distinctly do I become suited to Him.<a name=64:13></a> Like Rebecca, who, when she saw Isaac, lighted off the camel and threw a veil over herself, so, as I see Christ by faith, I lose sight of myself; Christ's presence makes me suited to Himself.<a name=64:14></a> He refuses all that is not of Himself, and gives prominence and countenance to all that is of Himself: "While the king is at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth its fragrance".<a name=64:15></a> When I see Him I shall be like Him, and the more I behold the glory of the Lord, the more I am moulded into its likeness.<a name=64:16></a> His word instructs me in the greatness and beauty of His things.<a name=64:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This ministry is within me, but discipline is from without, and concurrent.<a name=64:18></a> "All things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are

		called according to purpose".<a name=65:1></a> There is chastening or discipline for unjudged failure, "On this account many among you are weak and infirm, and a good many are fallen asleep".<a name=65:2></a> The flesh unjudged is judged; but I refer more to the discipline, which promotes holiness.<a name=65:3></a> The earnest soul drinks Marah, refuses the things which minister to the flesh, looks not upon the wine when it is red, but seeks to be always bearing about in the body the dying of Jesus, that the life of Jesus may be manifested in the body.<a name=65:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Discipline helps in order to this.<a name=65:5></a> "We who live are always delivered unto death .<a name=65:6></a>.<a name=65:7></a> .<a name=65:8></a> that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our body".<a name=65:9></a> It is to help those who are progressing; something like pruning to bring forth more fruit; but it is constant and unremitting, indicating that one is an unceasing object of interest.<a name=65:10></a> The cloud of witnesses in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11">Hebrews  11</a>all suffered for righteousness, but their sufferings tended to detach them from the world, and connect them more absolutely with God.<a name=65:11></a> As it has been said, every blow Stephen received was loosening him from all here, liberating him from all of man, that he might the more fully enter into all that is of God.<a name=65:12></a> Thus suffering is not only a testimony, but a help to holiness to the sufferer.<a name=65:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The aim of all discipline is to free me of everything which hinders Christ in me; so that, while the ministry of the word opens out to me the beauty and glory of my portion in Christ, the discipline through circumstances detaches me from the weights which hinder me here.<a name=65:14></a> It is ever where a believer has most vanity or self-confidence that discipline makes its mark.<a name=65:15></a> If Jacob be a very active man, he becomes lame.<a name=65:16></a> If Moses be a muscular man, he must learn by forty years in the wilderness not to trust in himself.<a name=65:17></a> And Paul is crippled where he feels it most.<a name=65:18></a> God will stain the pride of all men.<a name=65:19></a>

		This being accepted and held to in faith, there comes the question, What about the sins after conversion?<a name=67:12></a> It will not be asserted that there are none.<a name=67:13></a> True it is, that earnest souls have tried to escape from the sorrow and shame of sinning after conversion, by assuming and attempting to reach a state of sinless perfection.<a name=67:14></a> In this case, always, there is a lowering of the sense of holiness, in order to relieve the conscience of the sense of sin.<a name=67:15></a> It is like damaging one's sight, so as to have an excuse for not seeing.<a name=67:16></a>

		The course of grace now is, as in his case, that the feet are washed.<a name=68:15></a> It is not merely forgiveness, though that is included or connected with the washing.<a name=68:16></a> The forgiveness does not refer in any way to the safety of the soul, because God does not impute sin to anyone under the shelter of the blood of Christ; and yet with God, always, "the soul that sinneth, it shall die".<a name=68:17></a> God is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity; sin is of the devil.<a name=68:18></a> The washing is not in any sense a propitiation.<a name=68:19></a> The washing is to expose the root, or source, of

		the sin, and thus to free the believer of its working and defilement.<a name=69:1></a> It is the light of the word exposing the evil by substituting the good.<a name=69:2></a> This is done by the word, through the Spirit searching our conscience, often in much distress and confession; the latter (confession) because Jesus is our Advocate.<a name=69:3></a> The flesh having been judicially terminated in the cross, were it not for the advocacy of Christ, a returning to it in the believer would entail on him immediate excision from the life here.<a name=69:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, when the word has exposed to me the root of the sin which I have committed, I am in practical abhorrence of it; and the Spirit relieves me, by presenting to me what the ashes of the red heifer in the running water (see <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#19">Numbers  19</a>) typify; namely, that Christ bore the judgment of God for my failure.<a name=69:5></a> It is not fire now, but ashes, the token of accomplished judgment.<a name=69:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The effect on me of the washing is that I am cleared of the <i>source</i> of the sin; the root from which it came has been disclosed; the spot is gone, because the root is judged.<a name=69:7></a> "If we judged ourselves, so were we not judged.<a name=69:8></a> But being judged, we are disciplined of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world".<a name=69:9></a> Flesh must go wherever it is; we are not to be condemned with the world, but if we do not judge ourselves, we are judged of the Lord; hence it is, "many among you are weak and infirm, and a good many are fallen asleep".<a name=69:10></a> That is, there are cases when the works of the flesh are not forgiven; the flesh suffers here because it has not been judged.<a name=69:11></a> The flesh cannot be tolerated, and the more godly we are, the less can we tolerate it, or the more quickly is it judged.<a name=69:12></a> Real liberty is walking in the Spirit; for if I walk by the Spirit, I mortify the deeds of the body.<a name=69:13></a> The true course is, as Marah typifies, that I refuse everything for which Christ died; this is my real freedom.<a name=69:14></a> Hence, the man who has the greatest opportunity of gratifying

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now it is evident that sickness may fall on us here because of sins that we have not judged; that is, that God will, in some way, silence the flesh in the activity in which it has exposed itself, unless it is judged.<a name=70:2></a> When it is judged, it is disallowed, and here real repentance comes in.<a name=70:3></a> Thus "grief according to God works repentance".<a name=70:4></a> "I .<a name=70:5></a>.<a name=70:6></a> .<a name=70:7></a> repent in dust and ashes".<a name=70:8></a> I loathe myself, and my one relief is to see myself crucified with Christ, and thus the flesh as far from me as, through grace, it is from God.<a name=70:9></a> Hence it is that, when one is sick, it is said (<a href="../bible/James.htm#5:15">James  5:15</a>), "and if he be one who has committed sins, it shall be forgiven him".<a name=70:10></a> Up to that moment they had not been forgiven him, and this forgiveness related exclusively to his sickness.<a name=70:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not say that every sickness is because of sin, for I read about one being "sick nigh unto death .<a name=70:12></a>.<a name=70:13></a> .<a name=70:14></a> for the work of Christ"; again, a man may have inherited a weakly constitution; or may have shattered his health before his conversion.<a name=70:15></a> In this case I suffer the consequences of my unrighteousness after I am converted.<a name=70:16></a> The thief on the cross, though going to paradise, dies a felon's death.<a name=70:17></a> And constantly, in the Old Testament, the expression occurs, "and it shall be forgiven him".<a name=70:18></a> This does not relate to future, but to present things.<a name=70:19></a> There are instances when there is not present forgiveness.<a name=70:20></a> This I have adduced; and again (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:16">1 John  5:16</a>): "There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it".<a name=70:21></a>

		evident that the more anyone walks in self-surrender, the better he understands in himself the cross, the more he enjoys the Lord.<a name=71:1></a> And it is often because saints will not deny themselves that they pass through human sufferings; as it was said to Israel, in connection with "Marah" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15:26">Exodus  15:26</a>), "If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of Jehovah thy God, and do what is right in his eyes, and incline thine ears to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of the complaints upon thee that I have put upon the Egyptians: for I am Jehovah who healeth thee".<a name=71:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We all have to learn, when it is not at all a matter of sinfulness, that the less the flesh is given a place, the more of the power of Christ we have.<a name=71:3></a> This Paul learned when he came down from the third heaven, so that he can say, "I rather boast in my weaknesses, that the power of the Christ may dwell upon me".<a name=71:4></a> It is thus the apostle can say, "always bearing about in the body the dying of Jesus"; nothing for which He suffered is to be allowed in me, "that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our body".<a name=71:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then follows, "we who live are always delivered unto death on account of Jesus".<a name=71:6></a> No doubt it was persecution in that day, for it checked and cut down the flesh; but very often, now, sickness is sent to produce what persecutions effected then.<a name=71:7></a> I can understand how when one is suffering sickness instead of persecution, one becomes sensible of being made more practically fit for the service that one has at heart.<a name=71:8></a> When a believer dreads any tendency of his nature, when he looks not upon the wine when it is red, the Lord comes in to assist him by bringing in death in some way.<a name=71:9></a> For instance, if he has a love for music, by spoiling his ear; but in such cases the heart is always conscious of favour in the discipline, and not of rebuke.<a name=71:10></a> It is a very different thing when there is rebuke for self-gratification, from what it is when the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On the other hand, if any goes on gratifying the flesh, sooner or later his sufferings will spring from his gratification, just as Sodom became suffering to Lot.<a name=72:3></a> While, as with Isaac in Gerar, he not only reached Rehoboth, but, when he came to Beer-sheba, the Lord appeared to him <i>that night</i>.<a name=72:4></a> The Lord not only makes me glad of the surrender, but He more than compensates in Himself for any loss on my side: "manifold more in this present time".<a name=72:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus I have endeavoured to open out a little this interesting subject, assured that we do not sufficiently seek light from the Lord as to the bodily sufferings to which we are subjected.<a name=72:6></a> As I have already said, I do not think that one can interpret for another, but I am sure that if there were more exercise before the Lord because of our afflictions, we all should bear them better, and derive real blessing from them.<a name=72:7></a> Surely, when anyone is rendered thoroughly incapable here in mind or body, there must be something in it of the rebuke to Lot's wife, when turned into a pillar of salt.<a name=72:8></a> The Lord is full of compassion, and often one is allowed to go on in a carnal way for a long time, because one has no sense of the evil in one's conscience; but, assuredly, the day must come when all that selfishness will pass away by the stroke of His hand: "Our God is a consuming fire".<a name=72:9></a>

		In seeking light from the Lord on this important subject, we must first be absolutely clear of the thought which is so general in christendom, that God's Son became a man in order to repair and rehabilitate the first man - the Adam race.<a name=119:1></a> Many years ago it was said that man was broken china, but that Christ was like perfect china.<a name=119:2></a> This was absolutely denied by the most godly man of the day.<a name=119:3></a> Christ was not china at all, but unique, a man of His own order, and in His death the first man is clean set aside in judgment, and the new man is therefore according to God.<a name=119:4></a> Consequently we must not be deceived by thinking that the human mind can form an idea of any trait of the new man, or that it can imitate Christ, though many read the gospels with this object.<a name=119:5></a> Thus we start on this inquiry, looking entirely to God in order to understand the Man of His pleasure - "The holy thing also which shall be born shall be called Son of God" - "the expression of his substance" - "the beginning of the creation of God".<a name=119:6></a> As another has said, the difference between Him and us is that with Christ all His springs were in God, whereas our springs are in ourselves.<a name=119:7></a>

		Now our inquiry is: What is the new man?<a name=120:1></a> We have seen what it is <i>not</i>; we have already seen that it cannot be learned by any effort of the human mind, that its structure and nature are entirely beyond the conception of man, and the next question is: How do we learn it?<a name=120:2></a> I believe it is not by reading or by the mere study of Scripture that we learn it, but by association with Christ, by beholding the Lord's glory, and being changed into the same image.<a name=120:3></a> You could not explain what you get, but you get that which corresponds with Him; as you are with Him you acquire it.<a name=120:4></a> "Having put on the new man, which according to God is created in truthful righteousness and holiness" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:24">Ephesians  4:24</a>), is addressed to a believer who is in conscious union with Christ, seated in the heavenlies in Him.<a name=120:5></a> Now He comes out here in a new way, beginning with the mind, "renewed in the spirit of your mind" - not making works prominent, but in the renewed mind which is able to judge of the works that suit Christ.<a name=120:6></a> As we read in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:16">1 Corinthians  2:16</a>, "We have the mind (<i>nous</i>) of Christ" - we "put on the new man, which according to God is created in truthful righteousness and holiness".<a name=120:7></a> A believer realises the tastes of the new man by association with Christ.<a name=120:8></a> It is important to see that we derive from Him, we are in Him and He lives in us, He is altogether <i>sui generis</i> - of His own order, and it is only by association with Him that His nature and mind become experimentally known to us.<a name=120:9></a> It is so little known because association is so little sought.<a name=120:10></a>

		This draws the great line of difference between mere students of the word and those who enjoy His presence, beholding His glory; the latter can form a conception of what suits Him which the former cannot.<a name=121:4></a> We see from <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3:10">Colossians  3:10</a>, "Having put on the new, renewed into full knowledge according to the image of him that has created him" - that we cannot be with Him without getting enlightened; the word comes with more definiteness to our souls; we are "renewed into full knowledge", etc.<a name=121:5></a> Thus we see that as we become like Him by being with Him, we also get more intelligent in His mind, we know Him as Head and put on bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, etc.<a name=121:6></a>

		How is this effected?<a name=206:7></a> This is the great difficulty of the whole matter, and brings us to the third thing - the power.<a name=206:8></a> This we find in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:19">Ephesians  1:19</a> to 2: 6.<a name=206:9></a> The first action of the power is <i>in</i> you to raise you up and make you sit in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.<a name=206:10></a> This must take place before power can act from you, otherwise you would be a mere machine.<a name=206:11></a> To illustrate this - because it is a cardinal point - turn to <a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#3">Joshua  3</a>.<a name=206:12></a> Commentators tell us (and I quite agree with them) that you cannot get into Canaan until you are dead.<a name=206:13></a> But if there was no other way of my dying than by my body being laid in the grave, I should never get into the heavenly places until the dissolution of the body.<a name=206:14></a> What meets that is that we died with Christ, and we have also been raised up.<a name=206:15></a> Thus we get a sense of divine power giving us a place as members of the body of Christ outside this world altogether.<a name=206:16></a> This is what the power effects for us.<a name=206:17></a> The one who knows he has been raised up is brought into the enjoyment of heavenly things; he gets a new and peculiar sense of the wonderful power of God to place him above every opposing element.<a name=206:18></a> As God said to Joshua, "This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel" - the heart is centred on Christ.<a name=206:19></a>

		what I alluded to at first: how we should each one be interested in that which is the object of Christ's interest here, the church.<a name=208:1></a> First, I call your attention to the apostle Paul, who was the greatest of all evangelists.<a name=208:2></a> Let us see how he was interested in the church.<a name=208:3></a> He writes to the Corinthians, who certainly were not a particularly bright company, "I am jealous as to you with a jealousy which is of God; for I have espoused you unto one man, to present you a chaste virgin to Christ".<a name=208:4></a> How thoroughly was he in unison with the heart of Christ!<a name=208:5></a> Are you, am I, likewise?<a name=208:6></a> Are we anxious to see those who are so dear to Christ, suitable to Him?<a name=208:7></a> Was it because the Corinthians were very nice people and peculiarly agreeable to the apostle, that he took such an interest in them?<a name=208:8></a> On the contrary, we know how shamefully they treated him and slighted him.<a name=208:9></a> There was a grievous case of discipline at Corinth, and we know how much we are affected by such cases, and how much we feel about those implicated in them, but what was the apostle's anxiety?<a name=208:10></a> "Not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that <i>our care for you</i> in the sight of God might appear unto you".<a name=208:11></a> I need not multiply examples.<a name=208:12></a> As an evangelist the apostle could say, "I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some"; as a servant of the church, "I endure all things for the elect's sake".<a name=208:13></a> Another example is in <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#1:23">Philippians  1:23</a> - 25.<a name=208:14></a> The apostle had an earnest desire to depart and be with Christ; it would be a great deal happier for him, but it was better for the church that he should remain, and that settles the matter at once - he would remain.<a name=208:15></a> What would have been most desirable for himself is of no consideration when compared with what would be best for the church.<a name=208:16></a> There is one object on this earth that should command the attention of every one of us.<a name=208:17></a> This does not concern gifted brethren merely, but all.<a name=208:18></a> Those women who laboured with the apostle

		(<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#4:3">Philippians  4:3</a>) were not preaching, I am sure.<a name=209:1></a> I turn to two examples of what should characterise
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		those who take an interest in what belongs to Christ.<a name=209:2></a> The first is in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2">Luke  2</a>, when the Lord came into the temple for the first time.<a name=209:3></a> He was met by Anna the prophetess, "which departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day".<a name=209:4></a> What characterised her was complete devotedness to God's temple.<a name=209:5></a> And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years; let no one then complain of being too old or feeble to serve the church.<a name=209:6></a> I am sure we all own that the Jewish people were not at all equal to the church - the treasure hid in the field, the pearl of great price - but who of us is so devoted to that which is the body of Christ as this old woman was to a temple built of stone?<a name=209:7></a> How little one serves, not merely because one is fond of christians or the like, but with the idea that I am serving what is dear to Christ.<a name=209:8></a> Still it is most encouraging to know, amid all the confusion around, that the pearl of great price is still here, and Christ's interest in it undiminished.<a name=209:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second example is in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#21">Luke  21</a>, when the Lord is leaving the temple, as I read it, for the last time.<a name=209:10></a> He was going away to give all He had for God's glory on the earth, and He sees a poor widow casting into the treasury of the temple all her living - two mites, which make a farthing.<a name=209:11></a> Let no one then say he is too poor to serve the church.<a name=209:12></a> Devotedness of heart is not dependent upon either age or fortune.<a name=209:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In conclusion, I give you a verse which shows us what characterises true affection for the Lord's interests - <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:17">Revelation  22:17</a>, "The Spirit and the bride say, Come".<a name=209:14></a> <a href="#209:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> This is what characterises the whole,

		THE RESOURCES OF THE HEAVENLY POSITION
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:14">Ephesians  3:14</a> - 21
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Last evening we were looking at the dignity of our position, if I may use such a word - the rank we are in.<a name=211:1></a> Indeed, we could not get any higher position, for it is not simply relationship, but position, because it is not merely that we are sons of God, but united to Christ, and therefore we could not be in a closer position.<a name=211:2></a> No company of believers has ever had so close a place as those who form the body, and we are able to carry it out, not only now, but to all ages.<a name=211:3></a> Thus we are the complement, that which completes Christ, the setting forth, the full display, you a little bit, and I a little bit; hence when the church comes down from God out of heaven as the bride, she comes down having the glory of God.<a name=211:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what we have to look at this evening is not the dignity of the position, but the resources of the position.<a name=211:5></a> A man might have a great position in the world, but be entirely without means to support it.<a name=211:6></a> And that is one of the dangers with us as far as we talk of our high position and have not the means to carry it out.<a name=211:7></a> Not that there is not power for it, but really we do not enter into what this is, what the blessed God has for us.<a name=211:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The world might say, I do not see you are in the high position you talk about.<a name=211:9></a> I reply, I do not say I am, but what I am saying is that I have the means to maintain that position.<a name=211:10></a> And you always find that if a man has the means to maintain his position, he does not talk of his position; while the person who has not the means is always more or less inclined to talk of his position, because he wants to get an acknowledgment for a position he has not power to maintain; if he has
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=212>[Page 212]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		it, he need not remind persons of what his position is.<a name=212:1></a> Thus you will find with a person always reminding you that he is a heavenly man, very likely he is not walking at all as such, but wants to get the credit of the position he has not power to maintain.<a name=212:2></a> If he had the power for it he need not remind you of it, because he would be actually walking in it.<a name=212:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the resources are the consequences of a person having accepted his dignity; but if you have not answered to the latter part of the first prayer, this prayer would not touch you; you would not want it.<a name=212:4></a> Here is a person saying, I admit the wonderful dignity I am placed in as a member of the body of Christ, and now I want to know how to carry it out, for an empty title is nothing.<a name=212:5></a> Certainly this is a most necessary thing, and felt so amongst men, and in this country at least a man who has a title generally gets means to support it.<a name=212:6></a> What is a king if he has not a penny to support his dignity?<a name=212:7></a> A very great man, but he cannot maintain his dignity, he has not got the material support.<a name=212:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God grant we may enter into our resources more, for it is extremely comforting to us to know that the very place where people would deny the dignity is the very place where God gives me the power to support it.<a name=212:9></a> My dignity would not be denied in heaven; down here it is.<a name=212:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, tonight I do not dwell on my dignity, but on the means God has given me to support it.<a name=212:11></a> And I say it is the result of a person having taken his place in heaven, and therefore it is the prayer for it.<a name=212:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now turn to two scriptures in the Old Testament in order to get types of what this is.<a name=212:13></a> And we shall find a great principle, and the constant order of God, especially during this period, that provision is made for the thing before the exigency arises - that is, that before God wants you to do anything, He has provided for it.<a name=212:14></a>

		strength be"; but that is not the character of the present time, as you have your strength before the day, and you could not carry it out if it were not so.<a name=213:1></a> Thus we find it in our blessed Lord, and He was the full expression of it, for He came from God.<a name=213:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As I was saying lately, when God wanted to prepare Moses for the great trouble down here upon earth, He did not tell him one word about it, but occupied him with the patterns for the tabernacle, and with the beauties of heaven.<a name=213:3></a> A person says, That is too high, would it not make me unfit for anything here?<a name=213:4></a> Not at all; on the contrary, if we were more occupied with the heavenly, we should be all the better prepared to meet things here.<a name=213:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Moses had not a word of preparation because he was well prepared.<a name=213:6></a> He had been occupied for forty days in the full view of the beauties of God's order, and he was imbued with it, coloured by it, with what suited God.<a name=213:7></a> He could say, I have what suits God; hence when he comes down here and finds what has come in, without a word of instruction from God he tells the levites to gird on every man his sword and go out in the camp and slay every man his friend, or neighbour, or brother.<a name=213:8></a> He knew what suited God, and without a word of scripture for it he was prepared.<a name=213:9></a> That is the character of the thing now, and that is what we have to learn.<a name=213:10></a> We all fail in not being up to the crisis.<a name=213:11></a> And why?<a name=213:12></a> Because you do not know what suits God in the crisis.<a name=213:13></a> It is not a question of an honest man, but you do not know what suits God.<a name=213:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Learn like the psalmist in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#73">Psalm  73</a>!<a name=213:15></a> First he looks at the thing as a man here would look at it.<a name=213:16></a> But suppose he had first gone into the sanctuary, and had come from God, how would it have been then?<a name=213:17></a> I know well what a difference this makes.<a name=213:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As I say, and I do believe it is true, there is a great effect that takes place in us.<a name=214:6></a> It is not that God comes in with some distinct manifestation of His power in the thing; the manifestation of the power is in me.<a name=214:7></a> He says, I have brought you round to my own impression about the thing.<a name=214:8></a> You were coloured with what you were accustomed to do, but you are now coloured with what I feel about it.<a name=214:9></a> And that is the practical difficulty; Nebuchadnezzar looks at the material power, and he sees a head of gold; Daniel looks at it, and he sees a lion.<a name=214:10></a> What made the difference?<a name=214:11></a> One looked at it with man, the other with God.<a name=214:12></a> They were both honest men, but not both divine.<a name=214:13></a> One was a divine man and hence had a divine mind.<a name=214:14></a>

		Well, I say, we are thus to be concerned here with what belongs to Christ in the world in which He has been rejected; maintaining for Him, and as in chapter 6, to be "praying .<a name=226:11></a>.<a name=226:12></a> .<a name=226:13></a> with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching unto this very thing with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints".<a name=226:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What I want to show you - and it is the great thought before my mind, because so deeply interesting and so profound - is the Lord's present concern for His people, His thoughts about the church in its present state.<a name=229:5></a> The last four churches, as I have said, run down to the end, to the coming of the Lord, as all commentators of ordinary scriptural intelligence agree, representing four different phases of things in the church.<a name=229:6></a> Thyatira is Romanism; Sardis, Protestantism; Philadelphia, Separation; and Laodicea, Latitudinarianism, that is, no rule at all.<a name=229:7></a> These are the four phases, and they run down to the end, four concurrent streams running to a point.<a name=229:8></a> Thyatira and Sardis I do not mean to go into; but I am taking the two last in order to see Christ's present thought about His people.<a name=229:9></a> There is blessing even in thinking of it.<a name=229:10></a> How I wish I could convey to you the importance of studying this subject.<a name=229:11></a> Great blessings are ever derived from a patient study of true subjects, but nothing could give a deeper or more impressive blessing to your souls than simply occupying yourselves with considering what is Christ's present thought about His people.<a name=229:12></a> Just sit down for a quarter of an hour and consider what Christ thinks of His people, and see if you do not get a blessing.<a name=229:13></a> You will get a blessing, even though you may not get much light on it.<a name=229:14></a> Well, as I was saying, the book of Revelation is the last thing we get.<a name=229:15></a> It is not that the trees have not grown, but there have been no more planted.<a name=229:16></a> Trees may grow a great deal bigger, but the beech, the oak, the ash, is the same that was planted at first.<a name=229:17></a> So here, there is

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If everything was going right, it would be easy to understand what the manner of the Lord's dealing is; for it is the expression of His heart; and when everything is in accordance with His mind, He expresses Himself to that effect.<a name=230:3></a> Now, the first thing I ask of you is this, What do you understand about the <i>heart</i> of Christ?<a name=230:4></a> We will see afterwards how He expresses it.<a name=230:5></a> If everything is according to His mind, He is free to unbosom Himself to the soul in all the fulness of His affection without restraint; but if things are not according to His mind, He changes His manner; there is reserve.<a name=230:6></a> He never changes His heart, but He does change His manner.<a name=230:7></a> What, then, is the heart of Christ?<a name=230:8></a> You know already what the nature of His love is.<a name=230:9></a> I will turn you to <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:25">Ephesians  5:25</a>, to see what the heart of Christ is in itself: "Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing, but that it should be holy and without blemish".<a name=230:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this passage I get what the heart of Christ is, presented in three great characteristics, which I ask you to note - Christ's past, present, and future thought about His church.<a name=230:11></a> First, that He "loved the church, and gave himself for it".<a name=230:12></a> That shows the depth of His love, a love stronger than death.<a name=230:13></a> It is not only that He did great things for us, but He gave <i>Himself</i>.<a name=230:14></a> Beyond that, love could not go.<a name=230:15></a> Do you understand this, my beloved friends?<a name=230:16></a> - "Christ .<a name=230:17></a>.<a name=230:18></a> .<a name=230:19></a> loved the church, and gave himself for it".<a name=230:20></a> What deep meaning this conveys to the heart!<a name=230:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=231>[Page 231]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second characteristic is, "That he might sanctify and cleanse it".<a name=231:1></a> That is what Christ is doing now.<a name=231:2></a> Have you got a sense of the fact, that the same love of Christ which made Him give Himself for you is now occupied in separating you from everything that would separate you from Him?<a name=231:3></a> Nothing can express more the profound depth of the love of Christ for you than this, that His present occupation in heaven is devoted to removing everything that would cause distance between you and Him.<a name=231:4></a> When He was leaving His disciples, He poured water into a basin, girded Himself with a towel, and washed their feet, as expressive of His present service for us in the glory.<a name=231:5></a> I am going to glory, He says, but I am going there to serve you; My mind's attention will be rivetted on you, My heart's affection will be set on you, and I shall take care that nothing shall break the intimacy that subsists between us.<a name=231:6></a> I shall make it My business there to detach you from everything that would separate you from Myself.<a name=231:7></a> That is the wonderful nature of the heart of Christ, that He not only loved the church and gave Himself for it, but His present occupation is day by day bringing His word to bear upon you that He may set you apart from all that would hinder communion, and prevent any break between you and Himself.<a name=231:8></a> Nothing can - would that I could lead your hearts fully to respond to it - nothing can show more the depth of the interest He has in you than this - that he takes care that nothing interferes with the intimacy, that there shall not be the slightest reserve.<a name=231:9></a> A father loves a child, and a friend loves another friend, and their most earnest thoughts are to see the objects of their love free from blemish.<a name=231:10></a> But where love is connected with truth, you are very much more quick to detect any blemish either in your child or your friend than in any one you do not love so much.<a name=231:11></a> When you see the blemish, what do you think of?<a name=231:12></a> You think of the best means of removing it, because
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=232>[Page 232]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		you want to see the object of your love without a spot.<a name=232:1></a> This is the nature of Christ's love, and that is Christ's present occupation for you.<a name=232:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The third characteristic is "That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing, but that it should be holy and without blemish".<a name=232:3></a> I do not think this means that we are all to meet Him in the air, though that is quite true; the idea here is that He might <i>present</i> us to Himself <i>all fit</i> and ready for Him.<a name=232:4></a> It is like Eve when she is presented to Adam; he immediately accepts her as the one ready for him, perfectly suited for him, and made for him.<a name=232:5></a> And so Paul, in some measure answering to the thought of Christ - alas!<a name=232:6></a> that there are so few like him - says to the Corinthians, "I may present you as a <i>chaste</i> virgin to Christ".<a name=232:7></a> This is the heart of Christ about the <i>whole</i> church, and my heart must go out to that extent.<a name=232:8></a> I get Christ's heart here in its integrity, in its nature, what it is in itself.<a name=232:9></a> He "loved the church, and gave himself for it; that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word".<a name=232:10></a> With this intention, for this purpose of presenting it to Himself thoroughly prepared for Him, "that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish".<a name=232:11></a> This is His thought about His church, and He <i>carries out</i> His thought.<a name=232:12></a> You hear people say, Oh, when we meet the Lord, we shall drop everything that is unfit for Him.<a name=232:13></a> That is not the idea here.<a name=232:14></a> It is that Christ loved the church, and gave Himself for it that He might sanctify it, set her apart from everything that would separate from Himself, and that when the presentation comes, He presents it to Himself all ready and fit for Him, without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, holy and without blemish.<a name=232:15></a> So that were the Lord to come at any moment, the church is ready for Him.<a name=232:16></a> The same idea is in <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#3:13">1 Thessalonians  3:13</a>:

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness".<a name=233:1></a> Well then, having seen what the heart of Christ <i>is</i>, I shall now look at its expression.<a name=233:2></a> Love has got a <i>manner</i>.<a name=233:3></a> It has a mode of expressing itself; and the first thing I ask here is, What would be Christ's manner if there was nothing wrong, if all was going right, if there was nothing to check the expression of His love?<a name=233:4></a> There is no question of the love being there.<a name=233:5></a> He <i>has</i> the love; we have already seen that in all the marvellous fulness and profound depth of its nature; but the manner in which He expresses it is according to the state in which He finds saints.<a name=233:6></a> He expresses it either in approving or disapproving as the case may be.<a name=233:7></a> A father may have reserve towards his child, but that is his manner; his love is still the same.<a name=233:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I turn you to a scene in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>, to show what His manner would be if there was nothing to check His love.<a name=233:9></a> It is the first interview Christ had with His disciples after He rose from the dead.<a name=233:10></a> He enters the room where they are gathered and He enters it as the risen One, in all the magnificence of His new position, and standing on this new, this wonderful platform, He introduces them into the same new place as He is in Himself, and imparts to them the benefits that belong to that place - benefits which were never imparted to any before.<a name=233:11></a> Read from verse 19: "Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week".<a name=233:12></a> Everything was new, you see; it is a new day.<a name=233:13></a> "When the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.<a name=233:14></a> And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side.<a name=233:15></a> Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord".<a name=233:16></a> What I have read this for is to show, first, that I know the nature of His love; and secondly, I know how He would express that love if there was

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=234>[Page 234]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		nothing to check it.<a name=234:1></a> Here we see that everything was in order.<a name=234:2></a> The disciples are assembled together on the first day of the week.<a name=234:3></a> Christ comes into the midst of His gathered saints, where they were shut out from all else, and imparts to them what belongs to His new position.<a name=234:4></a> This is never repeated, though <i>we</i> get a fresh benefit ever from it.<a name=234:5></a> What I mean is, if you lose your peace you seek the same peace that you lost.<a name=234:6></a> You do not get a new peace.<a name=234:7></a> It is elementary, this scene, I admit.<a name=234:8></a> It is the alphabet.<a name=234:9></a> But one who learns the alphabet does not lose it when he gets further on; he is always using it, could not read if he were not using it.<a name=234:10></a> Now I want to show you from this passage what would be the expression of Christ's love, if everything were according to His mind.<a name=234:11></a> I cannot imagine anything more beautiful or more cordial than the way the risen Lord expresses Himself to these disciples thus met together.<a name=234:12></a> So complete is the absence of all reserve, not a symptom of restraint.<a name=234:13></a> There is perfect freedom to tell out His love, nothing to hinder the outflow of His affection.<a name=234:14></a> He salutes them with "peace".<a name=234:15></a> He shows them His hands and side.<a name=234:16></a> He imparts to them all the wonderful benefits which belonged to Him in His new position.<a name=234:17></a> How magnificent the whole scene!<a name=234:18></a> What could exceed its beauty and grandeur to one who values the heart of Christ?<a name=234:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have thus seen (1) what the expression of Christ's love would be if there was nothing to hinder it.<a name=234:20></a> Let us now (2) look at the expression of the same love when things are not according to His mind.<a name=234:21></a> I am going on carefully, you see.<a name=234:22></a> As I have said already, Christ never changes His heart, but He does change His manner.<a name=234:23></a> It is not because there is any change in His heart that He changes His manner, but because we are not acting according to His mind, and I turn you to <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:14">Revelation  1:14</a> to show this: "His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow;

		How does God produce a Philadelphian?<a name=241:5></a> A Philadelphian is one who is extricated out of Thyatira, which is Romanism, and Sardis, which is the Reformation, Protestantism, out of all ecclesiastical systems to walk a path of separation from evil, doctrinal and moral, in holiness and truth, and refusing to have to say to the latitudinarianism of Laodicea.<a name=241:6></a> As I have said, these four phases, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea, run like concurrent streams on to the Lord's coming, and the only one that escapes rebuke is Philadelphia, which is characterised by a "little strength" to rise superior to all the evils, and retain and maintain pure ground as Christ's witness in the midst of general failure, having purged itself from the corruptions of christendom, and returned to the simplicity of keeping Christ's words and honouring His name.<a name=241:7></a> But the point I am now desirous of showing is how a Philadelphian is produced, and with a view to this, I turn you to <a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#2">Hosea  2</a>, where you will find the great principle by which this is effected.<a name=241:8></a> You there get the mode in which God brought the captives out of Babylon, which, in principle, is the mode of extrication the Lord employs to disentangle His saints from human systems.<a name=241:9></a> I never saw a godly man yet, whatever his system, who did not confess that he was hampered by that system.<a name=241:10></a> And what is his excuse for staying in it?<a name=241:11></a> He says, I do not see anything better.<a name=241:12></a> That may be quite true, because that

		In order to be able clearly to apprehend what the apostle Paul calls "my gospel", it is necessary for us to understand what preceded it.<a name=253:1></a> Judgment, which is so great a quality of the spiritual mind, is the power of nicely distinguishing between two points in which there is the least difference; and where there is a spiritual mind its aim is ever to distinguish things that differ; and whenever this distinction is not made, and in proportion as this is lost sight of, there is not only ignorance, but defect in the exercise of the spiritual mind, which would have grappled with it and through grace have counteracted it.<a name=253:2></a> The word is given us to guide and instruct the spiritual mind, and to lead it to that judgment which would set the truth in its due place and order.<a name=253:3></a> I propose, therefore, to examine the gospel which was proclaimed and taught before there was any revelation unto Paul; and having done so, to present as clearly and fully as I can the gospel entrusted to Paul as to its nature and characteristics.<a name=253:4></a> I know and feel that I undertake a task which, though so interesting, is so little known that, if I had not the assurance of the Lord's mercy in helping and encouraging every little effort of His people to clear His truth of any mixture which leavens it, I could not attempt it.<a name=253:5></a> But with this conviction I assure myself that any, however feeble, tracing out and presentation of the truth as it has been revealed will be helpful and useful.<a name=253:6></a>

		there is some difference, at least in the gospel preached in each of these three periods.<a name=254:1></a> It must surely need but few words to convince a christian that the gospel which was preached before the death of Christ could not be the same as to fulness as that preached after His resurrection.<a name=254:2></a> It is true that when Mark commences the narrative of our blessed Lord's ministry he calls it "The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God"; but this passage indicates the nature of the narrative which he was about to give, that is, good tidings relating to Him as the Son of God, rather than the nature or subject-matter of the gospel preached.<a name=254:3></a> This last (the gospel preached) is definitely stated in verse 14 of the same chapter, where it is said, "Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel".<a name=254:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what was that gospel?<a name=254:5></a> Surely not the same as that preached by the apostles after the resurrection, or as that revealed to Paul.<a name=254:6></a> It was the gospel of the kingdom of God, as Mark plainly tells us; and that was, that God's <i>kingdom</i> was now offered to the Jews in the person of the Heir.<a name=254:7></a> Now the effect of repenting and believing this gospel is set forth in the prayer which our Lord taught His disciples, who, as the faithful of that day, had accepted this gospel.<a name=254:8></a> It was good tidings that God was offering to man, His kingdom and His Son, the Heir of all.<a name=254:9></a> The disciples believed this, and hence our Lord teaches them a prayer expressive of the state of soul which they as believing in this gospel should have; that is to say, they through grace were bound to have the sentiments which that prayer comprised.<a name=254:10></a> Prayer, when true, properly expresses the relation in which the soul stands with God.<a name=254:11></a> You cannot, if you pray truly, take higher relation than that in which you are set.<a name=254:12></a> When you pray to God you present yourself in that relation

		We find in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#8:1">Luke  8:1</a> that the Lord "went throughout every city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings [or gospel] of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him".<a name=255:4></a> And then in chapter 11, when He had ceased praying, "one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.<a name=255:5></a> And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.<a name=255:6></a> Thy kingdom come.<a name=255:7></a> Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth.<a name=255:8></a> Give us day by day our daily bread.<a name=255:9></a> And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us.<a name=255:10></a> And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil".<a name=255:11></a> In this prayer the Lord teaches His disciples to address God as their Father, because He had been exhibited here on earth in His Son, who could say, "he that hath seen me hath seen the Father".<a name=255:12></a> Hence He requires of them to address God in this name.<a name=255:13></a> "Hallowed be thy name" shows that they were on earth and desiring that the Father might be hallowed on earth; and as hallowed, that His kingdom might come - the kingdom of which the good tidings, or gospel, had been proclaimed by the Lord Himself.<a name=255:14></a> The gospel of the kingdom <i>was</i> a gospel, but this prayer shows the extent and position in which, under divine teaching, that gospel placed souls before God.<a name=255:15></a> No one can study the subjects contained in this prayer without seeing that the condition of soul described as expressing itself therein does not go

		Surely all this very clearly describes to us the state in which the believers in the gospel of the kingdom were placed.<a name=256:4></a> Nothing was assured - everything was in expectation.<a name=256:5></a> They had accepted it; they believed in God; but as such the Lord could not teach them more than this prayer embraced.<a name=256:6></a> He gave them the words which to the utmost suited their condition, and no believer could now really be satisfied with a condition which did not go beyond this.<a name=256:7></a> God is addressed as Father, it is true, but when this relationship is fully known, as now, through the "Spirit of his Son", it only makes the condition in which this prayer supposes and sets one the more unsatisfying, for surely as such I should expect and ask Him for more than is here set forth.<a name=256:8></a> Surely the prodigal, the thief on the cross, every christian now knows Him in a higher, an inconceivably higher way than this prayer presents.<a name=256:9></a> I adduce it merely to show the position in which the gospel of the kingdom, as preached before Christ's death, set souls before God.<a name=256:10></a> And if I go further and note the manner and ways of the apostles at this time, I see in them no moral power, no correct idea of the things of God, though they, to the joy and rest of their hearts, were in a surpassing way sheltered by Jesus in person.<a name=256:11></a> Would saints in the present day approve of being or consent to be no better in power, hope or intelligence than the apostles before the resurrection, who slept when asked to watch with Him, and who all forsook Him and fled?<a name=256:12></a>

		Now on the resurrection of Jesus the gospel obtains a remarkable breadth and fulness not known before that great event.<a name=257:4></a> The Lord not only stands in their midst a risen One, assuring them of peace, but He breathes on them and says, "Receive the Holy Spirit", <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:19">John  20:19</a> - 23.<a name=257:5></a> <i>Now</i> they are to realise that they not only believe in God, but also in Him.<a name=257:6></a> And they receive from Him the commission, "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.<a name=257:7></a> He that believeth and is baptised shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned", <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#16:15">Mark  16:15</a>,16.<a name=257:8></a> Here in precise and unmistakable language is declared to us the blessing of the gospel now to be proclaimed.<a name=257:9></a> The gospel at that time was that every one believing in Jesus risen, and taking his place in accordance with this fact on earth through baptism, should be saved.<a name=257:10></a> The gospel now conveyed salvation and the power of the Holy Spirit on earth, but nothing beyond this.<a name=257:11></a> "These signs shall follow them that believe: In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover".<a name=257:12></a> And we read (verse 20), the apostles "went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following".<a name=257:13></a> It is important to notice the nature and character of the gospel presented, because according to it must be the consequent blessing, and if I, like Apollos, preach only the baptism of John, as he

		Now if some have not advanced beyond the gospel preached during our Lord's life here, many more think they have gained the heights of grace when they proclaim with much energy and faithfulness the truth that salvation follows, and is assured to the soul on believing in a risen Christ.<a name=258:4></a> It is doubtless a truth of unspeakable magnitude that a lost sinner, at a distance from God and under fear of judgment, finds himself now through faith in Jesus Christ fully and finally saved by Him.<a name=258:5></a> It marks a new and wondrous era in the grace and mercy of God, and on the descent of the Holy Spirit Peter insists on this blessed truth, showing that the manifestation of the power of the Holy Spirit was indicative of the time when it should be fulfilled, and "it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be <i>saved</i>", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:21">Acts  2:21</a>.<a name=258:6></a> And further (verse 36), "Let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ".<a name=258:7></a> The Saviour was Lord and Messiah, and hence in verse 40 he calls on them, "saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.<a name=258:8></a> Then they that gladly received his word were baptised: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.<a name=258:9></a> And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.<a name=258:10></a> And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.<a name=258:11></a> And all that believed were together, and

		In the next chapter (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#4">Acts  4</a>) we find that the "priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them [Peter and John], being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.<a name=261:6></a> And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next day".<a name=261:7></a> Now after this marked rejection of their testimony by the leaders of the people and the heads of the nation of Israel, the apostles, it appears to me, adopt another style in their testimony.<a name=261:8></a> It is from henceforth more of the character of warning and denunciation, as from men forewarned and prepared for the rejection of it.<a name=261:9></a> Peter addresses the rulers of the people and the elders of Israel, and for the first time alludes to their rejection of Christ.<a name=261:10></a> "This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.<a name=261:11></a> Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved".<a name=261:12></a> Salvation is the great point insisted on; a Saviour "under heaven", not yet as seen in

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now two things are presented here: Christ risen and a Saviour and the Holy Spirit here on earth in testimony thereof.<a name=262:8></a> And this is the last recorded exposition of the gospel which Peter preached before the death of Stephen; for in the next two chapters we are told how the people and the elders and the scribes came upon Stephen and caught him and brought him to the council; and then deliberately they not only rejected but stoned to death the witness of the Holy Spirit, who by the word of God appealed to their consciences not to resist the Holy Spirit.<a name=262:9></a> Thus, as before in the death of John the baptist, they had proclaimed their opposition to Him whom John proclaimed; so now by the stoning of Stephen they openly unmask and expose the hatred and rebellion of their hearts to a glorified Christ.<a name=262:10></a> It is now declared that there is no acceptance of Him on earth by His own people, but on the contrary, there is in act the open avowal, "We will not have this man to reign over us".<a name=262:11></a>

		Let us turn to Paul's epistles, and seek to gather from them the characteristics proper to those who have received the gospel committed to Paul.<a name=266:7></a> The characteristics indicate the origin and nature, and the nature and origin in action always express the characteristics.<a name=266:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the epistle to the Romans, where Paul calls the gospel "the gospel of God" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#1:1">Romans  1:1</a>), "the gospel of his Son" (verse 9), and "my gospel" (chapter 16: 25), the first characteristic we find of it is justification through faith, because God's righteousness is revealed in Christ.<a name=266:9></a> Here the line and order of truth is that man, whether under law or not, is without righteousness, but that outside and apart from man God has brought in righteousness through His Son, and that He is therefore just to justify every one believing in Christ.<a name=266:10></a> The righteousness of God is thus a characteristic of Paul's gospel.<a name=266:11></a> If you have received

		this gospel, you have found yourself in the righteousness which God in Christ reveals to faith.<a name=267:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the righteousness of God is established in the cross of Christ - He bearing in Himself the judgment on man, so that there is an end of that which offended against God.<a name=267:2></a> He was made sin for us, that we should be made the righteousness of God in Him.<a name=267:3></a> There is then an end of man as man was; the old man is crucified with Christ.<a name=267:4></a> Hence, with righteousness of God there is another characteristic, namely, the end of man in the flesh.<a name=267:5></a> Then comes life eternal: grace reigns "through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord".<a name=267:6></a> The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.<a name=267:7></a> A further characteristic is that "ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit".<a name=267:8></a> It is the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus which has made me free from the law of sin and death (chapter 8: 2), and "if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his" (verse 9).<a name=267:9></a> Here, then, we have four leading characteristics of Paul's gospel, and if I am established according to it, as he prays that I may be (chapter 16: 25), I must have learned that it confers on me, and sets me in, four distinct blessings (1) In righteousness according to God; (2) The end of the old man; (3) In eternal life in Christ Jesus; (4) Possessing the Spirit of Christ - all summed up in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:10">Romans  8:10</a>: "If Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness".<a name=267:10></a> Let the soul endeavour to embrace all that is in this epistle conferred on it by Paul's gospel: righteousness - the righteousness of God established by Christ, the ending of the old man, the gift of eternal life, the Spirit of Christ; so that Christ in me is the summing up as well as the fulness of blessing.<a name=267:11></a> One who has received and is established in this gospel is in divine righteousness, is freed from the old man before God, is in the eternal life of the Son of God, has Christ's Spirit, and

		The gospel in this epistle only reaches so far as to set the soul in Christ, and, as may be seen from a study of it, the Spirit of God first shows how both Jew and gentile have failed as men to do anything to please God; but, on the contrary, that there is none righteous, no, not one; and at this point the apostle introduces his gospel.<a name=268:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in the epistle to the Galatians we get this highest point - being in Christ - fully explained and unfolded.<a name=268:4></a> In this epistle the saints had gone back from the teaching of the gospel, which had set them in the Spirit, and they were now seeking perfection in the flesh.<a name=268:5></a> They were not like the Romans, who were ignorant of the gospel.<a name=268:6></a> The Galatians had retrograded; they <i>had</i> begun in the Spirit, they <i>did</i> run well.<a name=268:7></a> And hence the way the apostle brings the light of the gospel to bear on them is quite different from the way he deals with the Romans, and therefore he opens out powers and properties in the truth of it, which are not so fully declared in the epistle to the Romans.<a name=268:8></a> In Galatians, as it is most interesting to observe, the apostle begins with the fact of being in Christ the Son of God, outside of man altogether.<a name=268:9></a> He is an apostle, "not of men, neither by man".<a name=268:10></a> And again (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#1:11">Galatians  1:11</a>,12): "I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.<a name=268:11></a> For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ".<a name=268:12></a> And then he explains in verses 15 and 16 what he received himself and what it was.<a name=268:13></a> "It pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace, <i>to reveal his Son in me</i>".<a name=268:14></a> This is the great point.<a name=268:15></a> God had revealed His Son in him.<a name=268:16></a> This gives a definite character to the nature of the gospel.<a name=268:17></a> In Romans we are gradually brought to this point as the grand total, as indeed it is.<a name=268:18></a> But here this total is the starting-point.<a name=268:19></a>

		Paul now addresses those who had declined from the true path, the path of the Spirit, outside and apart from the flesh.<a name=269:1></a> If I have begun with Christ, God's Son revealed in me, it is not in the flesh I live, but Christ liveth in me.<a name=269:2></a> And "the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me", <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:20">Galatians  2:20</a>.<a name=269:3></a> And I myself am crucified with Christ; and if I be crucified, it is senseless to revive that in myself for which He was crucified.<a name=269:4></a> The great point the apostle insists on as conclusive against the existence of man in the flesh, and therefore against the re-assumption of it by a christian, is that "God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.<a name=269:5></a> And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.<a name=269:6></a> Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ".<a name=269:7></a> Paul's gospel is definite and conclusive on this point.<a name=269:8></a> The believer receives the Spirit of Christ; Christ lives in him; and if he departs from this, he departs from Paul's gospel, which he preached to the Galatians in infirmity; but they had received him as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.<a name=269:9></a> And now that they had gone back from it, he has only to tell them, I must go over all the old ground.<a name=269:10></a> "My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you", <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:19">Galatians  4:19</a>.<a name=269:11></a> This is the point they had lost sight of, and this is the one which he will take all pains, travail in birth <i>again</i>, until it be restored, even that Christ should be formed in them.<a name=269:12></a> I need not pursue this further; but it is important to see how simply and fully Paul's gospel sets us in Christ, and that "they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts".<a name=269:13></a> Everything of it is ignored and set aside <i>judicially</i>; and if judicially set aside, it cannot legally be resumed.<a name=269:14></a> But this truth certifies and simply

	<div class="paragraph">
		determines man's state as in the flesh before God.<a name=270:1></a> And the apostle does not make this an attainment - an advance in knowledge, but shows it as affecting the foundation of christianity; that it is the kernel of his gospel, and that anything else is not the gospel, and not to be attended to, even though preached by an angel.<a name=270:2></a> Nay, that "if any man preach any other gospel .<a name=270:3></a>.<a name=270:4></a> .<a name=270:5></a> let him be accursed".<a name=270:6></a> In this epistle the great point is that I am <i>in Christ</i>.<a name=270:7></a> Hence, it is not certain great characteristics and virtues that I have received which are presented to me as in Romans.<a name=270:8></a> It is impressed on me that I am in a new order of existence, after another order of man.<a name=270:9></a> <i>Christ lives in me</i>.<a name=270:10></a> It is not that the old man has received additions and advantages as in a legal religion, but that I am made anew of Him who is the Son of God, and that the old man has been superseded and judicially put an end to in His cross; being crucified with Christ, it has no longer any recognised existence before God; while I, in my new creation, am in Christ, and He lives in me.<a name=270:11></a> These are two points of the very highest importance, and their presentation in this epistle, as the very kernel of Paul's gospel, is most interesting and complete.<a name=270:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus far we have, I trust, seen how the gospel places the soul before God in relation to Him, and also with relation to the old man.<a name=270:13></a> Now this was very partially unfolded in the gospel preached by Peter.<a name=270:14></a> He preached salvation, perfect and final, through a risen Saviour, and the present indwelling of the Holy Spirit; great elements, it will be admitted, in the truth revealed to Paul; but they did not set aside man as entirely and judicially ended in the cross of Christ, nor connect the soul with Christ as its life and head, though the saints possessed it through the Holy Spirit.<a name=270:15></a>

		Now there are two things connected with glory which give a finished view, a complete idea, of Paul's gospel.<a name=273:2></a> One is our inheritance there, from which we derive our present position in heaven, and the other, the resurrection of our bodies.<a name=273:3></a> The apostle says in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>, "We are saved by hope".<a name=273:4></a> And as I have already noted from <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:5">Colossians  1:5</a>, the word "hope, which is laid up for you in heaven", was "<i>heard</i> .<a name=273:5></a>.<a name=273:6></a>.<a name=273:7></a> in the word of the truth of the gospel".<a name=273:8></a> The gospel includes this hope; nay, the hope was a main part of it, and is therefore called the "hope of the gospel", from which the saints were not to be moved, and which many, seeing it so distinctly insisted on, and not understanding what it truly meant, explained as the hope of salvation eventually.<a name=273:9></a> Now it is as set with Christ in glory - glory being the sphere proper to our membership with Christ, that the formative process morally to that glory takes place in us - that we are "transformed .<a name=273:10></a>.<a name=273:11></a>.<a name=273:12></a> from glory to glory".<a name=273:13></a> But in this glory there is an inheritance for us.<a name=273:14></a> Therefore the apostle prays that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, "that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance", of which the Spirit is now the earnest.<a name=273:15></a> It is beyond my subject to speak of the inheritance, but I merely desire to assure the heart of the fact that in connection with Paul's gospel, and because of the sphere in which the believer in Christ is thereby set, there is "an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, .<a name=273:16></a>.<a name=273:17></a> .<a name=273:18></a> reserved in heaven for you", as Peter speaks of it, in that glory in which our association with Christ is now through the Spirit (and not merely in the future), and where we are now transformed into His image.<a name=273:19></a>

		Elijah was going away, and this causes him to put the question to Elisha, "Ask what shall I do for thee, before I be taken away from thee".<a name=277:5></a> Give me, said Elisha, "a double portion of thy spirit" - a competent portion.<a name=277:6></a> Very well, but there is only one way in which you can get it.<a name=277:7></a> "If thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so".<a name=277:8></a> Now, beloved friends, whether you think it simple or not, that is the only way to get power.<a name=277:9></a> If you see me when I am taken, it shall be unto you; and if not, it shall not be so.<a name=277:10></a>

		The sure way to discover and elicit the hindrance and the nature of the hindrance to the truth which God has revealed, or that which He is reviving at any time, is by simply pressing it.<a name=292:1></a> The obstacle to its reception and adoption, as that which blocks up a narrow passage, must then be discovered and encountered, in whatever form it may exist.<a name=292:2></a> God reveals His mind and will, and the way this is received discloses the real state of man.<a name=292:3></a> The mind of man is enmity against God, it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be; and the effect which follows from pressing the truth and mind of God at any time is always the same, namely, some are purged by it, and the rest are judged.<a name=292:4></a> <a href="#292:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> It is evident this must be the case.<a name=292:5></a> Let us bear in mind that man is in his nature opposed to the will of God, and that where the nature is unjudged and unmortified by the Spirit of God, Satan can use it in direct antagonism to God.<a name=292:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But how is it, one may say, that man, if thus opposed in purpose and intent to the mind of God, seems often in some sort to accept truth and to range himself under it?<a name=292:7></a> The answer is simple.<a name=292:8></a> Man will accept and bow to anything which exalts man <i>as man</i>; and assuredly christian ethics do this, inculcating high elevated relations between man and man, and thus contributing to man's sense of his own dignity.<a name=292:9></a> Hence they meet with approbation even from those who recklessly deny the author of them.<a name=292:10></a> It is only when the truth is pressed as God's word to man that there can be the savour of His knowledge, which is to one the savour of death unto death, and to the other the

	<div class="paragraph">
		But we must draw a distinction between those who have no link to God at all in their souls, and those who have, but who are choked and embarrassed by their associations and the indulgence of nature; and also those who are inwardly sighing for strength to escape from a state of things which is intolerable to them.<a name=293:4></a> There are these three classes of persons to be found in the professing company of God's people on the earth whenever general declension has set in.<a name=293:5></a> The first we have noticed are merely professors, and are in nature opposed to God's truth and mind; the second, not in soul opposed to it, but because of circumstances and associations, warped and disobedient; the third, tried and oppressed, but ready and longing for divine light and guidance.<a name=293:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now declension cannot set in unless there be an imperfect reception of the truth; for it is the carelessness and inaccuracy with which it is held which, like breaches in a garrison, open a way for the entrance of those who assume the guise of the converted, but who are in heart opposed.<a name=293:7></a> It is most important to bear in mind that if the truth of God were faithfully maintained, no one not of His Spirit could long submit to it.<a name=293:8></a> True, the good seed may be received for a time in the evil soil, but the surest way to expose that it has no root, is by the increased faithfulness and self-surrender of those who have received the word in truth; for if it be maintained in any careless way, opportunity is afforded for the indifferent, mere professors, to follow in the wake and company of the true-hearted.<a name=293:9></a> What is to stay, order, or determine the

		course of man, but the mind of God?<a name=294:1></a> God has revealed His mind.<a name=294:2></a> If this be imperfectly presented, then the standard by which everything of man must be judged is lowered, and error escapes; therefore it is the insisting on the truth of God which the Holy Spirit authenticates and confirms to the soul, which alone exposes all the elements of nature which clog and hinder souls from adopting and following His will.<a name=294:3></a> Hence when the testimony is revived, it is always with this effect: some are purged from the confusion, and the rest judged as immersed in it.<a name=294:4></a> I think the servants of Christ ought to lay it to heart how far they are accountable before God for the low slumbering state of the church.<a name=294:5></a> It was when the servants went down and did eat and drink with the drunken that the kingdom of God was likened unto ten virgins who slumbered and slept, and the two great evils in the professing body took place.<a name=294:6></a> Had the servants done their duty, had the wise virgins kept lively and wakeful, walking according to their vocation, the foolish would have shrunk from association with them.<a name=294:7></a> When God revived His work, and there was a cry made, the effect was evident enough: the wise were purged and the foolish were judged.<a name=294:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now among the third class of persons I have mentioned above, the really true-hearted, there is often a complaining that we are in the midst of evil association and the like; but while ready and desiring to escape from it, they do not see that the only way to do so is by becoming practical exponents of the truth committed to them, in the power of which they would be purged from their false associates, and the false associates would be judged.<a name=294:9></a> There is really no other way to emerge from the confusion, and it is a way in which, as the difficulties increase, the moral power of overcoming them is known also.<a name=294:10></a> Thus Paul exhorts Timothy that the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine.<a name=294:11></a> But what does he then enjoin

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is plain enough that the upholding of the truth of God, not only in His grace and mercy towards man, but in the scope and purpose of His own mind as He counsels and devises, is that which alone can separate His people from hindering associations, and that when they simply walk in it, they are purged from them through the power of it, while those from whom they are distanced are at the same time judged by it.<a name=295:5></a> A double effect follows, blessed to the faithful, but disastrous to the blind and wilful.<a name=295:6></a> It is after this manner that God effects deliverance for His people from time to time, when declension and intermixture have set in because His mind and counsel have been departed from or feebly maintained.<a name=295:7></a> Thus was it at the very first, when the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair, and took of them wives as they chose.<a name=295:8></a> When the consequences of this confusion (for it is always the case that the good degrading itself to the evil, the high to the low, leads to a greater corruption than evil by itself) were manifest to Noah, as God's servant - the one used by Him to effect deliverance out of such a state of things - God's mind is declared; and through it he was purged, as we know, and the rest judged.<a name=295:9></a> How simple and unique the principle!<a name=295:10></a> There is one course and only one for the faithful on earth, and that is to maintain the truth of God committed to them, as we shall not fail to see if we pay ordinary attention to the way souls have allowed

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the point of moment for us to examine is the mode and manner in which souls are diverted or hindered from accepting the deliverance which God offers.<a name=296:5></a> There is no difficulty in seeing why an unbeliever cannot yield himself to the mind of God, when it is simply and distinctly pressed on him.<a name=296:6></a> This is class 1.<a name=296:7></a> But the question of interest and anxiety to us is, What would hinder <i>saints</i> from adopting and following the counsel and will of God?<a name=296:8></a> What, in short, is the cause of the difference as to the reception of it between No.<a name=296:9></a> 2 and No.<a name=296:10></a> 3 of the classes I have mentioned?<a name=296:11></a> It is, I believe, that the one has been prepared by exercise and discipline for the acceptance of increased light; while the others, on the contrary, are by their habits and self-indulgence so warped, and so blinded by nature, that they are unable to accept it.<a name=296:12></a> We learn from Scripture that at no time did all who professed to be God's people, and who had taken their place as such, accept and follow the word of God pressed on them in order to revive His name and power among them.<a name=296:13></a> And hence the effect of that word was to mark off some as faithful, the rest as unprepared.<a name=296:14></a> It purged the one and judged the other.<a name=296:15></a> Now the cause of this unpreparedness is not because of the difficulty of the course prescribed by the call of God in order to revive His testimony at such a time, but because of the habits and tastes which have been allowed and fostered previously to the call.<a name=296:16></a> If there be any unjudged selfishness which I allow to preponderate, I am unable to let the Word have its true

		This comes out in various ways.<a name=297:8></a> Mere contention will oftentimes disclose it, which, though it happens unexpectedly, is ordered of God to test and prove His servants at the time.<a name=297:9></a> The contention between Paul and Barnabas confirmed and established Paul in the right course, while it exposed how Barnabas had previously suffered from association with the Jewish element connived at by Peter (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2">Galatians  2</a>), and when the strain came, he betrayed how much he had been injured by it; <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#15:37">Acts  15:37</a> - 39.<a name=297:10></a> Had there been no contention they might have gone on apparently smoothly; but the contention brings to light the strength of the truth in Paul, and exposes Barnabas, who, having allowed himself to tamper with Peter's inconsistency, is unprepared for divine action when the call for it comes; the result is, he separates from Paul and sails to Cyprus.<a name=297:11></a> It is thus that the moral atmosphere is purified.<a name=297:12></a> When Abram's herdsmen contend with Lot's herdsmen, the faith of Abram is elicited, and at the same moment Lot's worldliness is disclosed and finds a vent for itself, so that the future course of each and their relation one to another is determined.<a name=297:13></a> When the Philistines contend with Isaac and eventually

		At first David and Saul seemed to harmonise; but when the test came, and the conflict arose, and as it increased, the moral virtue of the one was exhibited, while the treachery and baseness of the other were open and palpable.<a name=298:6></a> The more the evil pressed against the good, as set forth fully in our Lord's life here, the more significantly and finely did His excellency shine forth and strike the line between what was of God and what was against Him.<a name=298:7></a> Those who followed Him were purged, the rest judged.<a name=298:8></a> It is the conflict of the opposing forces which elicits the qualities of each.<a name=298:9></a> Hence when there is slumbering, the foolish virgins appear similar to the wise; but when the wise take their true place and maintain the truth by responding to the cry, separation instantly ensues; the good is marked off distinct and separate, and the evil marked off as evil and worthless; "the good figs, very good; and the evil, very evil, that cannot be eaten", <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#24:3">Jeremiah  24:3</a>.<a name=298:10></a> Principles are disclosed according to their true nature and intent.<a name=298:11></a> Hence there is always with supineness a feeble demonstration of power, as there is corresponding feebleness of opposition to it, or rather of the virus of the opposition.<a name=298:12></a> But when a stir comes, the slumberers are disturbed, and elements arrange themselves according to their order; the true and good are

		But besides this - and it is a solemn fact - it is when the conflict occurs, when the day of testing comes, that the causes and habits of life, which have prepared and led a man to oppose the truth, or which have blinded him against his right course, are found out.<a name=299:3></a> We often forget that we are weaving blinds for our own eyes by not studiously cultivating the <i>activities</i> of divine life.<a name=299:4></a> We often deceive ourselves by concluding that because we steer clear of certain evils we are preserved in capability and fitness for service in the field.<a name=299:5></a> But this is not enough; we must walk in the Spirit.<a name=299:6></a> Life is a <i>positive</i> thing; it does not merely sever one from certain carnalities, it declares its own virtue and power, and thus prepares and qualifies one for any emergency.<a name=299:7></a> He that lacketh these things - he with whom the activities of life are not present - is blind, short-sighted (see <a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#1">2 Peter  1</a>).<a name=299:8></a> If the activities of our new existence in Christ are not maintained, we cannot be proof against the direful influences of this evil scene.<a name=299:9></a> There can be no preservation for us but by the power of the Spirit rebutting the antagonistic and damaging elements.<a name=299:10></a> Now if we grow blind and short-sighted because of our neglect of these, or from habits of selfishness which we always drop into when they are not displaced by those of grace, it is evident that when a stir comes, when we are told the Philistines are on us, when the conflict occurs, we shall be like Samson, unable to meet the foe; and like him we shall have to say that we wist not that the Lord had departed from us.<a name=299:11></a> And still more: our inability to act in the crisis, discloses the <i>cause</i> of our weakness.<a name=299:12></a> With Samson it was that he had allowed his hair to be shorn off by Delilah; with Barnabas, that he had connived at Peter's dissimulation.<a name=299:13></a> In neither would

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From the beginning, there was some special truth revealed, to which alone for the time the testimony of the Lord was attached.<a name=340:1></a> The truth was committed to some chosen vessel and, if it was accepted, the servant through whom it came was well received; but according as the truth was rejected, so was he refused.<a name=340:2></a> The treatment of the servant to whom the truth is committed is the index of the value which man attaches to the truth.<a name=340:3></a> If there has always been a truth which bore this great mark - the testimony of the Lord - how much more must it be so now, when the word or the counsel of God is fulfilled (see <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:25">Colossians  1:25</a>).<a name=340:4></a> To the apostle Paul the final testimony of the Lord was committed; and when the saints were ashamed of that testimony they were ashamed of the servant - His prisoner.<a name=340:5></a> "All they which are in Asia be turned away from me", writes the apostle; <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1:15">2 Timothy  1:15</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus they proved their disregard for the Lord's testimony in the way in which they disregarded His servant, who was the apostle of it.<a name=340:6></a> It is important to see first that there was always a special truth with which the testimony of the Lord was connected; and, secondly, that the effort of the enemy is to divert the people of God from it, and to hinder them from strictly and fully maintaining it; while on the other hand wherever there was faith in any, even in the darkest moment, there was always distinct succour from God to enable them to do so.<a name=340:7></a> Faith in God only could surmount the opposition which the people of God had to encounter in maintaining the testimony at any given time.<a name=340:8></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the truth which most distinctly vindicates God with regard to man, because it was revealed consequent on the breakdown of man, is the one necessarily most outside of man.<a name=341:3></a> God revealed Himself gradually, but as each successive trial made of man proved, more than the preceding one, that man is irrecoverable and unable to maintain the testimony of the Lord, He at last sent His Son, and consequent on His death and rejection He called out Saul of Tarsus to maintain the present testimony.<a name=341:4></a> This new testimony is not connected with the trial of man, but was given subsequent to it.<a name=341:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The trial of man was closed on the cross.<a name=341:6></a> Every previous dispensation had placed him under trial, and the testimony of the Lord at that time, if it had been maintained, would have given man some place as man; it conferred distinction on man according as he maintained it.<a name=341:7></a> Had Adam maintained the testimony given to him in Eden, he would have added distinction to himself.<a name=341:8></a> Had Noah maintained the testimony committed to him he would have distinguished himself.<a name=341:9></a> Had the fathers - had Israel done so, they would have risen in the scale, and secured a name for man in the flesh, as subject to God.<a name=341:10></a> But in each and all man failed, and finally proved his entire ruin in his inability to comprehend the excellence of every divine and human beauty in the Person of the Son of God manifested in flesh.<a name=341:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If man was found incompetent to maintain the testimony of the Lord when the maintenance of it would have exalted himself, how evident it is that he can get no place in that testimony which is subsequent to the cross, where the history of man under trial closed.<a name=341:12></a> We must bear in mind that our blessed Lord

		was refused both as a man on earth and as a man in heaven -- "He came unto his own, and his own received him not".<a name=342:1></a> They said, "This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours".<a name=342:2></a> So they cast Him out and killed Him.<a name=342:3></a> The perfect Man, the Son of the Father, is disallowed of men, but God raised Him from the dead, He having given His life a ransom for many.<a name=342:4></a> Secondly, in the refusal of His servant Stephen, whom they stoned to death, they refused the testimony of the Holy Spirit concerning Him as risen, and avowed, "We will not have this man to reign over us".<a name=342:5></a> Hence the testimony of the Lord, brought out now, must be characterised by that which will express the effect through grace of this double rejection.<a name=342:6></a> Therefore, it does not now subject man to any fresh trial.<a name=342:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The trial of man was over on the cross - in the death of our Lord Jesus Christ, whom God has set forth as a propitiation for our sins, that He might be just and the Justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.<a name=342:8></a> The testimony is of the Lord Jesus Christ - the one Man who has entirely met the mind of God in everything, and who also has appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself.<a name=342:9></a> It altogether ignores man as he was under trial, before the cross; there is no offer to him to recover himself, and the maintaining of the testimony now would in nowise add distinction to him, but the reverse, because the testimony now is of the One who died for him, and who, when refused and disallowed of men, was called by God to His own right hand.<a name=342:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before the death of Christ, while man was under trial, although the maintenance of the testimony always required divine power, yet, as it was maintained, whether by Noah, Abraham or Moses, it gave distinction and place to each - as men in the flesh.<a name=342:11></a> But the cross sets man aside in a double way.<a name=342:12></a> In it there is atonement for man's sin, which of itself is evidence

		that there was nothing in man through which he could live before God; and that there was no other way but the death of Christ to reconstitute him according to the mind of God, or to plant him in the likeness of Christ.<a name=343:1></a> Therefore, if man in the flesh be allowed a place now, there must be at the start an incapacity to maintain the testimony of the Lord as committed to, and preached by, Paul - the prisoner of the Lord.<a name=343:2></a> The testimony is that there is one Man in heaven who has answered in every way to the mind of God on earth, and who then died for our sins, glorifying God while bearing the judgment which lay upon us - that He was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father and has sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high; that this one Man in heaven is not only our Saviour, but He is our Head, and we, the members of His body on the earth, draw our strength from Him and find our life in Him, through the Holy Spirit who is here consequent on His exaltation, dwelling in each of us, and thus uniting us to Him and to one another.<a name=343:3></a> This is the testimony which was committed to Paul, and from this all in Asia had turned away.<a name=343:4></a> Hence, the apostle warns Timothy (the servant of the hour) not to be ashamed of the testimony of the Lord, nor of himself - His prisoner.<a name=343:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the failure of "all they which are in Asia" is that to which every saint in the present day has a tendency, or is in danger of, even though he may have suffered on account of the testimony; for those who turned away from it in the apostle's day had been personally taught and led by himself.<a name=343:6></a> It is not that the truth of christianity as a whole is relinquished, but there is a return to a previous testimony in order to escape the peculiar and exacting nature of this the greatest of testimonies.<a name=343:7></a> Hence, for nearly 1800 years, this great testimony has been in abeyance, and now that through unspeakable mercy it has been revived, we are not one whit more secure against the adversary than were those in Asia.<a name=343:8></a>

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=344>[Page 344]</a>

		The danger of those who have learned the testimony is that, while owning the truth as the Colossians did, they should reduce it to a theory - for instance, holding the doctrine of the unity of the body merely as a doctrine, instead of as the known result of union with the Head.<a name=344:1></a> Hence the apostle had great agony for them that they might realise and enjoy the unprecedented blessedness of association with Christ.<a name=344:2></a> This was the paramount energy of the Spirit of God, and if it was so in that day before the universal demoralisation had set in, how much more now in our day when through God's unaccountable favour the truth has been partially recovered!<a name=344:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Whatever God is most set upon, that Satan most opposes.<a name=344:4></a> 'Be anything, or do anything' is in fact the language of the great adversary, so that you do not aim at being what God desires you to be.<a name=344:5></a> Do any good work you like; be earnest preachers; be anything, except maintainers of the testimony of the Lord.<a name=344:6></a> For hundreds of years Satan has succeeded in keeping the most faithful servants of the Lord in the dark as to this great truth, and if he can succeed now by any means, be it even by withdrawing opposition to the spread of the gospel, or any good work, he will do so, I am persuaded.<a name=344:7></a> Surely to any godly and enlightened soul it is the gravest question whether he answers to the apostle's appeal: "Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner".<a name=344:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have no hesitation in stating that the greatest duty that now devolves on any servant, and the one attended with most honour from the Father (see <a href="../bible/John.htm#12:26">John  12:26</a>), is the maintenance of this testimony.<a name=344:9></a> It overrides all gifts and services.<a name=344:10></a> It is, like the colours of the soldier, the first and unmistakable expression of every true servant.<a name=344:11></a> He owes the Lord a higher duty than he owes any one.<a name=344:12></a> It is true that gifts and services are for men, and to be used for their benefit.<a name=344:13></a> But the servant of this hour is mistaken when he places even the benefits

		The history of its action is an interesting, instructive study.<a name=359:5></a> Dependence on God, or <i>faith</i>, is the first element of our new existence, the great antagonistic principle to the old nature - "whatsoever is not of faith is sin".<a name=359:6></a> My will in nature being errant, all my power, natural or acquired, acts so as to sustain what is wrong, that is, my natural will.<a name=359:7></a> But in the life of Christ and in the sensibilities of His nature, I am constantly finding that difficulties occur to me in my path here, all the greater because my will runs counter to God's will.<a name=359:8></a> Nay, more, I find that many new desires are awakened within me, which I have no power in nature to gratify.<a name=359:9></a> In both these cases I learn that I must lean on God; and as I lean on Him, and know what is His mind or intention towards me, so I have faith or confidence in Him about any given result.<a name=359:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In conclusion, I pray you, beloved friends, to lay hold by faith of the home the blessed God has obtained for you according to the satisfaction of His own heart, accomplished by the Lord Jesus Christ, who said, "I come to do thy will" - not merely to secure the sinner's benefit, but to do God's pleasure.<a name=387:5></a> And therefore He says, "I have meat to eat that ye know not of.<a name=387:6></a>.<a name=387:7></a> .<a name=387:8></a>.<a name=387:9></a> My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work".<a name=387:10></a> Secondly, although you may see all this you cannot enjoy it but as you accept <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>, and take the place of death.<a name=387:11></a>

		Let us turn to <a href="../bible/John.htm#10:9">John  10:9</a>.<a name=391:5></a> There you are told where you are, and the change which has taken place.<a name=391:6></a> Now it is of all importance to understand the change; the sheep are of a new order.<a name=391:7></a> "By me if any man enter in, he shall be saved".<a name=391:8></a> To be saved is not known in the fold.<a name=391:9></a> They were preserved and that is all.<a name=391:10></a> If you were in the fold, keeping the law for a thousand years, and then left it, you would be lost, you would be under the judgment.<a name=391:11></a> In this verse I get the christian charter, if I may say so.<a name=391:12></a> "By me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out" - that is, he is at liberty.<a name=391:13></a> "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty".<a name=391:14></a> There are no walls, and he finds pasture.<a name=391:15></a> There is no pasture in the fold, that is a misconception that has obtained from modern customs; because now in agricultural districts they fold the sheep on turnips in order to feed them.<a name=391:16></a> But that is not the idea of a fold here.<a name=391:17></a> An oriental fold was simply four walls built in a square in order to protect the sheep from the wild beasts, something like a country pound.<a name=391:18></a> The Lord states the contrast, they "shall be saved", and not only saved, but at perfect liberty, they "shall go in and out, and find pasture".<a name=391:19></a> I do not dwell longer on this, because it will come out fully when we come to the practical side.<a name=391:20></a> In the end of verse 10 the Lord says, "I am come that they might have life, and might have it abundantly".<a name=391:21></a> Here we have the moral state of the sheep.<a name=391:22></a> This is a very great thing; would that it were known to all our christian friends!<a name=391:23></a> Would that

		I could address all of them on the face of the earth tonight!<a name=392:1></a> I should say to them, If you do not see the immense difference between a sheep, a really converted soul in Israel before Christ came, and a sheep called by Him since He came, you have not apprehended His gift, namely, "I am come that they might have life, and might have it abundantly", which He fulfilled when He rose from the dead, and breathed upon His disciples.<a name=392:2></a> He tells you in the next verse how He brings it about: "I am the good shepherd.<a name=392:3></a> The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep".<a name=392:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in verse 14 He states a very important change as to the relation of the sheep to Himself.<a name=392:5></a> He is the good Shepherd, and He not only bears the judgment of the responsible man, and gives life in Himself who has borne the death due to us, which is a most wonderful thing, but more, in verses 14 and 15 He says, "I am the good shepherd, and I know those that are mine, and am known of those that are mine".<a name=392:6></a> The same kind of knowledge subsists between the Shepherd and the sheep as subsists between the Father and Christ.<a name=392:7></a> Now, beloved friends, where could you find such a portion in the whole range of the Old Testament?<a name=392:8></a> Ponder it, "I am the good shepherd; and I know those that are mine, and am known of those that are mine, as the Father knows me and I know the Father".<a name=392:9></a> That is the nature of our intimacy.<a name=392:10></a>

		In verse 27 the Lord completes the new position, "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me; and I give them life eternal, and they shall never perish, and no one shall seize them out of my hand.<a name=392:11></a> My Father who has given them to me is greater than all, and no one can seize out of the hand of my Father.<a name=392:12></a> I and the Father are one".<a name=392:13></a> Not only does He "give them life eternal, and they shall never perish", but that is not all.<a name=392:14></a> Seeing that they are down in a world of difficulty, where Satan is, He adds, "No one can seize" [the same word as is used earlier in the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, beloved friends, I turn to the Hebrews to see our own side in relation to this great position in which we are set.<a name=393:15></a> I begin at the first chapter, because I want to show the moral condition you start with.<a name=393:16></a> In the third verse we read, He having "purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high".<a name=393:17></a> If you take your place on the earth, you must take it as a redeemed people.<a name=393:18></a> Israel was in figure a redeemed people.<a name=393:19></a> The line is continued, but in a new order.<a name=393:20></a> It is an unbroken line in one sense, only there is a great difference in its character.<a name=393:21></a> God had spoken by prophets, but He now speaks by the Son.<a name=393:22></a> We have looked at His side, very insufficiently I know, but I trust it will induce you to study the scripture for yourselves, and I look to the Lord to turn this little into much for you.<a name=393:23></a> The first thing to apprehend in faith on this new ground is that, having purged our sins, He sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high.<a name=393:24></a> The moment you are occupied with sins in the assembly, you have left your new position.<a name=393:25></a> You start

		with His having purged your sins, there is no more remembrance of sins; and there is a stronger word.<a name=394:1></a> The worshipper once purged, has no more conscience of sins, that is, God has no more claim on me for sins; if He has, there must be a fresh sacrifice, which cannot be, for by one offering He has perfected for ever them that are sanctified.<a name=394:2></a> Christ our passover has been sacrificed for us.<a name=394:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now you cannot understand your position on the earth unless you believe that your sins are gone.<a name=394:4></a> I have already presented to you that you are out of the fold; you are saved, you are at liberty, and finding pasture; you are in the greatest intimacy with your Saviour, the same kind of intimacy as there is between the Father and the Son; you have received eternal life; and you are preserved in the most perfect way on the earth, you are in the hand of Christ and of the Father.<a name=394:5></a> Hence, if you refer to sins, you have gone back to the sheep in the fold, and therefore some say, 'Lord, have mercy upon us, miserable sinners.<a name=394:6></a>' Such an one does not apprehend the new position.<a name=394:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Being assured of the first - sins being purged - we now come to the second, that, while your sins are gone, there are infirmities.<a name=394:8></a> But before touching on infirmities, let me show you the position you occupy here now with relation to the Lord.<a name=394:9></a> We read in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:12">Hebrews  2:12</a>, "I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee".<a name=394:10></a> That is the twenty-second verse of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22">Psalm  22</a>; twenty-one verses describe what He went through on our account, and in verse 22 He turns round and brings in a new thing altogether, as much as to say, I have cleared away all on your side; now I will unfold to you from God's side.<a name=394:11></a> He is in the midst of the assembly; and hence we read in chapter 3, "Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus".<a name=394:12></a> There He is, and in verse 6, He is

		Next, "Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.<a name=396:8></a> For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.<a name=396:9></a> Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need".<a name=396:10></a>

		Here the great thought before us is Jesus the Son of God.<a name=396:11></a> It is interesting to connect this with <a href="../bible/John.htm#9:35">John  9:35</a>.<a name=396:12></a> He has now passed through the heavens.<a name=396:13></a> He is not now in your circumstances; He <i>was</i> in them; and He ministers to you from the height where He is.<a name=396:14></a>

		Next let us read <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#8:1">Hebrews  8:1</a>, "Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens; a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man".<a name=397:8></a> All the chapters between the fourth and the eighth are taken up with describing our High Priest, One who sympathises with us in our infirmities.<a name=397:9></a> It is not merely that you are supported, but you are brought into company with Himself, that is your place in Hebrews.<a name=397:10></a> We have seen that in <a href="../bible/John.htm#10:14">John  10:14</a>, 15 it is the intimacy between Him and us.<a name=397:11></a> But here it is from your own side, your infirmities, because if you are engrossed with them you are not enjoying intimacy with Him.<a name=397:12></a>

		Well, I need not dwell longer on this subject, because one's heart must be exercised about it in order to understand it.<a name=397:13></a> Mary, in <a href="../bible/John.htm#11">John  11</a>, is in deep sorrow because of her brother's death.<a name=397:14></a> Jesus sympathises with her and walks beside her, so that in chapter 12 we find that she has passed right over to His side; she is not thinking of her sorrow now, but thinking of Him; she is in company with Him, and

		Now in the second verse of chapter 8 we read, "A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man".<a name=398:13></a> As you are in company with Him, and enjoy His presence, you are associated with Him, the Minister of the holy places.<a name=398:14></a>

		In chapter 10 you will find still more.<a name=398:15></a> We read in verse 19, "Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus".<a name=398:16></a> You are in the presence of the Lord, the High Priest over the house of God!<a name=398:17></a> That is your wonderful position, even while on this earth, because the house of God is here, and it is over this house the great Priest is.<a name=398:18></a>

		Chapter 11 had set forth the <i>traits</i> of faith; remember the word 'trait,' because the general impression is that chapter 11 sets forth the examples of faith.<a name=400:4></a> Traits of faith acquaint you with faith.<a name=400:5></a> Noah would have the same faith as Abraham if he were in Abraham's place.<a name=400:6></a> The point is to convince you of the wonderful qualities of faith.<a name=400:7></a> Have you faith in Jesus?<a name=400:8></a> "Ye believe in God, believe also in me".<a name=400:9></a> The apostle shows them - the Hebrews had the Old Testament scriptures - all the way from Abel down, the qualities of faith.<a name=400:10></a> And faith is the power, the horse figuratively, which is to carry you to Jesus where He is.<a name=400:11></a> He has gone all the road Himself; and therefore you are told that the greatest obstruction that could be, the cross, was in His way; thus the cross is used here.<a name=400:12></a> "Who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross" (that He might get to the top), "despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God".<a name=400:13></a> You will find many a difficulty in the way, but if you walk in faith you will be able to say, "By my God have I leaped over a wall".<a name=400:14></a> It is a race, and you are to "lay aside every weight".<a name=400:15></a> If you have too much business, lessen it; anything is a weight if it hampers you.<a name=400:16></a> "Ye .<a name=400:17></a>.<a name=400:18></a> .<a name=400:19></a> took joyfully the spoiling of your goods".<a name=400:20></a> I have seen Him, I have tasted of the presence of the heavenly One, and now I am <i>running</i> on to Him, and I lay aside everything that would hinder.<a name=400:21></a> A weight is outside; the sin is inside; it is not any particular sin, but the nature that is in you.<a name=400:22></a> Faith has power to overcome opposition, and you have now to confront every opposition.<a name=400:23></a> "Ye have not yet

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The subject I desire to bring before you this evening is the new ministry, the ministry of the Lord to His own.<a name=402:1></a> Chapters 13 and 14 should be read together, there is properly no break.<a name=402:2></a> At the end of chapter 14 the Lord says, "Arise, let us go hence".<a name=402:3></a> He leaves the supper table, where He was with His own.<a name=402:4></a> In that sacred enclosure He opened out, not only the trials and difficulties which would arise amongst His own during His absence, but at the same time the nature of His ministry to them.<a name=402:5></a> Let us turn to chapter 13 first, because there we get the service which prepares us for chapter 14, which is His provision for us during His absence.<a name=402:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 13 it is of deep importance to understand His action.<a name=402:7></a> He rises from the supper table - the supper table properly represents His death - and pours water into a basin, and girds Himself with a towel and washes the disciples' feet.<a name=402:8></a> Now this is of the utmost importance, because He says, "If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me".<a name=402:9></a> It is here all anticipation.<a name=402:10></a> Now while the Supper is going on He gets up and introduces this new service, the washing of their feet.<a name=402:11></a> You see the ignorance of Peter, yet it is the first service.<a name=402:12></a> You cannot have part with Christ now without it.<a name=402:13></a> It is entirely new to the disciples; there they were in the closest intimacy sitting beside Him, and He says, "If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me".<a name=402:14></a> Peter then wanted him to wash both his hands and his head, but the Lord answered, "He that is washed" - bathed properly - "needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit".<a name=402:15></a> The Lord is about to take a new place, as it is stated in the Hebrews, "Such a high priest became us, holy, harmless, undefiled,

		separated from sinners".<a name=403:1></a> "Separated" is the right word, that is, He is entirely outside them, and has gone into the heavens.<a name=403:2></a> If there be a soil of any kind it must be removed.<a name=403:3></a> You might be restored to affection for the Lord as Peter was, and yet your feet not be washed.<a name=403:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This service is at the beginning, and without it you would lose the ministry of the Lord.<a name=403:5></a> You must know the service of chapter 13 before the ministry of chapter 14.<a name=403:6></a> If you are not in communion with Him you cannot understand His ministry; you may have what are called believers' meetings, with a measure of enjoyment over the word, but nothing could satisfy the disciples but to have <i>part with Him</i>.<a name=403:7></a> They had enjoyed His presence, and nothing could make up for the loss of it.<a name=403:8></a> In one sense we are never out of His presence; the veil is rent, but to consciously take your place there is quite another thing.<a name=403:9></a> If there is any soil on you, communion is interrupted.<a name=403:10></a> It is not only that you have sinned, but that you are conscious that there is a shade of reserve between the Lord and you.<a name=403:11></a> Just like a child which has soiled its dress, and though the mother may tell it to change its dress, still there is a sense of reserve between it and the mother.<a name=403:12></a> The washing of the feet is to remove this sense of reserve.<a name=403:13></a> Now this is the beginning, the start.<a name=403:14></a> If you seek the Lord's presence anywhere, even in your own room, the word remains true, "If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me".<a name=403:15></a> What hinders us is that we are at a distance.<a name=403:16></a> He always cares for us and helps us, but it is from a distance, you are not near, because the effect of being near Him is that you are transformed.<a name=403:17></a> It is not only that you are satisfied in His presence, but there is a wonderful effect produced on you by being in it.<a name=403:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you study <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>carefully, you will find it to be a little epitome of church history.<a name=403:19></a> You get here all the elements of disturbance, but at the same time
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=404>[Page 404]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		you get the service of Christ for His own.<a name=404:1></a> I ask you to look at the order; here the Lord rises from the supper table, which prefigured His death, to present another lesson, in order that they might be kept without a soil to enjoy His presence.<a name=404:2></a> It is all-important to know that you cannot enjoy the presence of the Lord while there is a shade of distance between Him and you.<a name=404:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next look at the state of things in this little company; there is treachery there, Judas ready to betray his Lord and Master.<a name=404:4></a> How terrible!<a name=404:5></a> But the Lord is washing His disciples' feet.<a name=404:6></a> The true nature of love comes out in this service; it is not giving something desired, but it is removing some obstacle to communion.<a name=404:7></a> People often confine charity to giving.<a name=404:8></a> I get the chief service of love in <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>, where it is to remove an impediment in another; while in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#13">1 Corinthians  13</a>I prove my love by discarding my selfish motives.<a name=404:9></a> As one has said to another, who was finding fault with everybody, You improve the world by one man.<a name=404:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in verse 31 you get another thing, "Therefore, when he (Judas) was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.<a name=404:11></a> If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him".<a name=404:12></a> This blessed One is to be glorified, and with Him, the glorified One, we have to do, now glorified in heaven, from where He will come in glory.<a name=404:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in the end of this chapter you come to another great trouble, the unfaithfulness of Peter.<a name=404:14></a> Not one of us with any conscience but must own with sorrow that we have at times lowered our flag in the presence of opposers; that is, we shrink from opposition.<a name=404:15></a> Thus Peter denied the Lord, and yet there was no one he loved so much.<a name=404:16></a> Peter was like Isaac with his wife, he did not give up his affection, but he denied his relationship.<a name=404:17></a> To deny your relationship to Christ is unfaithfulness.<a name=404:18></a> When you are socially at home with people, even your own relations, your danger is that you
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=405>[Page 405]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		morally deny your relationship to Christ, because you accommodate yourselves to your company; the beginning of every failure is in social intimacy with company morally below you.<a name=405:1></a> "Evil communications corrupt good manners".<a name=405:2></a> The more spiritual a man is, the more he seeks company spiritually above him, because he wants to be helped on.<a name=405:3></a> When he wants to be loose, he seeks company spiritually below him.<a name=405:4></a> And the general order of failure is that he seeks company spiritually below him and socially above him.<a name=405:5></a> Now this is the other element of trouble in this little company.<a name=405:6></a> Thus there are two great sources of trouble, as we may say, in the assembly; while the Lord, who could arrest and counteract these troubles, is going away, so that the trouble is intensified.<a name=405:7></a> Hence chapter 14 opens with "Let not your heart be troubled".<a name=405:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The general idea is that <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>is for one going out of this world; on the contrary, it is for those staying on the earth.<a name=405:9></a> It is the new ministry, the provision which the Lord makes for His own on the earth during His absence.<a name=405:10></a> It is a wonderful chapter.<a name=405:11></a> I cannot expound it, though I can see glimpses of it.<a name=405:12></a> Its object is, "Let not your heart be troubled", and when He has detailed His ministry He ends with, "Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid".<a name=405:13></a> You are not only out of it, but do not be afraid of it.<a name=405:14></a> You cannot fail to see the elements of deep trouble which were there, but thank God, at the same time all the blessedness of Christ's heart for His own is declared; and the first thing He will do is to remove every soil, that you may have "part with me" - that you should share with Me, as in Hebrews, be My companions.<a name=405:15></a> And what a gladness it is, when we are really in company with Him where He has the oil of gladness above His companions!<a name=405:16></a> There is our place.<a name=405:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 14 two great subjects are presented: one is faith, and the other is love.<a name=405:18></a> Faith runs on to the end of verse 14, then it is love.<a name=405:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=406>[Page 406]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the first thing is that you should have the same faith in Christ as you have in God; you have faith in God though you do not see Him.<a name=406:1></a> Many speak of faith in God, most important, but you are to have faith in the Lord Jesus, as you have in God; as we read in Colossians, "faith in Christ Jesus", faith in the One who was a Man down here, and is now a Man at the right hand of God.<a name=406:2></a> It is not faith merely that He was here, but that <i>He is</i> in heaven.<a name=406:3></a> That is the first thing.<a name=406:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next is His provision for you in His absence.<a name=406:5></a> The greatest relief to the troubled heart is, "In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you.<a name=406:6></a> I go to prepare a place for you".<a name=406:7></a> You are thus assured of your place in the highest spot, and thus detached from this scene of trouble.<a name=406:8></a> In the gospel the prodigal tastes of the joys of his Father's house.<a name=406:9></a> But that is not exactly the same as here.<a name=406:10></a> I think it is important to bear in mind that here it is not merely the festivity of the Father's house, but something more definite, even that you have a place prepared for you in the Father's house; this I believe will have a great practical effect on you.<a name=406:11></a> It is not merely that you have a home there or a place of enjoyment, but what I have in chapter 14 is a place, and I would press it much, because nothing could have a greater effect on you, in the absence of Christ from this world, than that you have not a place here, but that you have a place where He is.<a name=406:12></a> The effect this will have on you is that it connects you in heart with the place where He is, and it displaces you from the place where you are.<a name=406:13></a> I remember the effect it had on myself.<a name=406:14></a> You have a place where He is, and this must give a new character to you.<a name=406:15></a> It is not as in Ephesians, where you are raised to heaven.<a name=406:16></a> A place is prepared for you there; the Lord says, "I go to prepare a place for you".<a name=406:17></a> It is not that He is preparing it now.<a name=406:18></a> When He entered heaven it was prepared.<a name=406:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=407>[Page 407]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You have a place there now.<a name=407:1></a> You may say you are not in your place; yet it is prepared for you.<a name=407:2></a> Not only are the joys of the Father's house yours, as a son in the Father's house, but also the Son has gone back a Man to the Father's house, and He has a place for you there.<a name=407:3></a> Remember He is speaking to Jews.<a name=407:4></a> As Jews they looked for a place on earth, and now they are troubled, overwhelmed with the circumstances they are in.<a name=407:5></a> The Lord does not propose to give them a green spot, a happy retreat for the evening of their days here.<a name=407:6></a> No, on the contrary, He says, "In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so I would have told you.<a name=407:7></a> I go to prepare a place for you".<a name=407:8></a> The Son of God has gone up a Man into the Father's house, and having done so He prepared a place there for you.<a name=407:9></a> In Ephesians you are raised up to the place where He is; and many commentators have tried to weaken that word "heavenly places", and call it "heavenly things".<a name=407:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The reason of this is obvious.<a name=407:11></a> If you have a place there, you must be dissociated from this place.<a name=407:12></a> Let a husband tell his wife, I have a beautiful place for you in Australia; what is the effect upon her?<a name=407:13></a> She is involuntarily interested in the things which suit Australia; her heart is in Australia; she is here, but her chief interests are there.<a name=407:14></a> The nature of the place is before you, and you want suitability to it.<a name=407:15></a> Each of the disciples could say, and surely you ought, My Lord and my Saviour has gone to the Father's house, and, thank God, I have a place where He is.<a name=407:16></a> I press this because I know the effect it will produce.<a name=407:17></a> Nothing ever so dissociated me from this earth.<a name=407:18></a> Your heart will follow Him to heaven, where He has a place for you.<a name=407:19></a> Just as a wife might say of her husband, He has gone to Australia, and he has a place for me there, and he will soon come and fetch me.<a name=407:20></a> But the Lord is far beyond what any husband could be: he cannot convey to her, though still here, his life in Australia.<a name=407:21></a>

		I do not enter into details down to the end of verse 14; I must ask you to study it, and the more you do the more affecting you will find it.<a name=408:1></a> The ignorance of Thomas and Philip indicates our own.<a name=408:2></a> Thomas does not know the way, and Philip says, "Show us the Father".<a name=408:3></a> The Lord replies, "I am the way, the truth, and the life", and "He that hath seen me hath seen the Father".<a name=408:4></a> Now when you lay hold of this word, you will read the gospels in a new way, unfolding to you how the Lord Jesus Christ was sustained in every contrariety here, and this by the Father.<a name=408:5></a> Not only will He come again and receive us to Himself, that where He is, there we may be also, but He makes known to us the Father, who owns the house, before we reach the Father's house.<a name=408:6></a> There are some at whose house you have never been, but if you went you would be quite at home because you know the owner of the house.<a name=408:7></a> So here, you know the Father.<a name=408:8></a> "He that hath seen me hath seen the Father".<a name=408:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In verse 14 He adds, "If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it".<a name=408:12></a> The Father is to be glorified in the Son.<a name=408:13></a> He would that you should answer to Himself here, just as Stephen did.<a name=408:14></a> Stephen was a transcript of the Lord.<a name=408:15></a> He passed triumphantly through what the Lord endured.<a name=408:16></a> True, he found the Lord had overcome them, yet he had to encounter all.<a name=408:17></a>

		Turn to verse 15, where we get the practical effect of love, even obedience, "If ye love me, keep my commandments".<a name=408:20></a> You all know very well that you like to keep the injunction of a loved mother no longer here, because as you do so you are reminded of

		Now let us proceed.<a name=409:15></a> The Lord says, "I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you".<a name=409:16></a> That is Himself, not the Holy Spirit.<a name=409:17></a> "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you" - that is plural.<a name=409:18></a> "The

		Then comes verse 21, "He that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him".<a name=410:8></a> A wonderful statement.<a name=410:9></a> Paul says, "The Lord stood with me".<a name=410:10></a> This is individual, as the other passage was collective.<a name=410:11></a> Judas, not Iscariot, says, "How is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?<a name=410:12></a>" Then the Lord explains.<a name=410:13></a> "Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him".<a name=410:14></a> Mark the word 'abode,' it is the same as the word for 'mansion' at the beginning of the chapter.<a name=410:15></a> The first is that He has prepared an abode for you in the Father's house, and He Himself is the way to it; keep Him before you and you have the way.<a name=410:16></a> That is exactly what Stephen found, that Christ was the way.<a name=410:17></a> But not only are you by Him at home in that place; but as you are dependent on Him, you receive power from Him to rise above all obstructions, because He delights that the Father should be glorified in the Son, that is, that you should be here, in any measure, in moral correspondence to Himself.<a name=410:18></a> Then as the Holy Spirit has come down, you now know what it is to be in Him.<a name=410:19></a> "At that day", that is, the

		In these addresses I have endeavoured to bring before you "the creation of God" - the new order.<a name=425:1></a> The first was man's new position with God; the man that was driven out of Eden, the prodigal, is now through grace enjoying the festivities of the Father's house.<a name=425:2></a> The second, the new position which the people of God have upon the earth, was altogether outside of the Jewish fold and the religious order inculcated there.<a name=425:3></a> The third was the new ministry, the ministry of Christ in <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>and 14 for His own during His absence, the preparation for testimony.<a name=425:4></a> The fourth was the new power, the Holy Spirit come down from heaven in a twofold way; sent by the Father, and sent by the glorified Christ.<a name=425:5></a> This evening I come to the next, which I call the new centre, or as another has named it, the new metropolis.<a name=425:6></a> If I can present it to you according to its greatness, you will find that everything now is determined from this centre.<a name=425:7></a> It is from heaven, the right hand of God, that everything of God must come.<a name=425:8></a> Stephen says, "I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God"; that is the new centre.<a name=425:9></a> The first point is that everything now must come from the Lord in heaven.<a name=425:10></a> The more you study it the more you will find that this is true.<a name=425:11></a> Paul's gospel comes from heaven; he says, "I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ".<a name=425:12></a> It is evident the mystery comes from Christ in heaven.<a name=425:13></a>

		First, you must lay hold of the simple fact that Stephen sees Him where He is.<a name=426:4></a> He is altogether apart from the earth; there is no longer any connection with the religious order on the earth.<a name=426:5></a> The great practical work in the soul of a believer is to loosen him from the earth; not merely from the world.<a name=426:6></a> In <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#14">Luke  14</a>, one man went to his land, another to his oxen, and another to his wife; there was nothing morally wrong in any of these, but they all belonged to the earth, the wrong place.<a name=426:7></a> If you are really true to the right place, other things will be subservient and in their right place.<a name=426:8></a> It may be alleged, If I have to make so much of heaven, how can I attend to my duties here?<a name=426:9></a> The answer is, You will attend to all to which God has called you a great deal better, because in every ordinance of God you would have divine guidance and support.<a name=426:10></a> The example for a husband and wife is Christ and the church; they are not referred back to Adam and Eve.<a name=426:11></a> If a wife understands the relation of the church to Christ she will behave rightly to her husband.<a name=426:12></a> And if the husband understands Christ and the church, he will understand how to behave to his wife.<a name=426:13></a> The highest circle, the one of the deepest interest to Christ Himself, is the only one to guide you in your greatest circle of interest here.<a name=426:14></a> It is very striking that if you want to behave yourself in the circle of interest nearest to your own heart naturally, you have to learn Christ in His highest interest.<a name=426:15></a> And if you do not apprehend Him in His highest circle, you are defective in your own.<a name=426:16></a> Hence the more heavenly you are, the more you are associated with Christ, the better you will be in the details of all your duties here.<a name=426:17></a> It is the man of the greatest power who does the smallest thing best.<a name=426:18></a> Even a man's handwriting is characteristic of his ability - a particular faculty, though he has not universal ability.<a name=426:19></a> A man

		Now let us turn to <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#22:44">Matthew  22:44</a>: "The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool".<a name=427:2></a> I ask you to consider this.<a name=427:3></a> Are we impressed by the fact that our Lord has left this earth?<a name=427:4></a> How little is our personal attachment to Him!<a name=427:5></a> He has been refused here.<a name=427:6></a> Would you like to be great where He has been refused?<a name=427:7></a> Here it is, "Sit thou on my right hand", as in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#110">Psalm  110</a>, "till I make thine enemies thy footstool".<a name=427:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		He has gone from the earth, but He has sent down the Holy Spirit.<a name=427:9></a> "He shall testify of me".<a name=427:10></a> If you read the early chapters of the Acts, you will find that the disciples in chapter 1, as they gazed up into heaven, are rebuked, "Why stand ye gazing up into heaven?<a name=427:11></a> this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven".<a name=427:12></a> And as you read on, you find Peter and John imprisoned, and then all the apostles.<a name=427:13></a> Thus it was made manifest that they will not receive the Lord from glory; already they had refused Him on earth; "by wicked hands" He was "crucified and slain".<a name=427:14></a> This is referred to in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#22">Matthew  22</a>.<a name=427:15></a> Now you get a further thing.<a name=427:16></a> They refuse the testimony of the Holy Spirit; hence Stephen says, "Ye do always resist the Holy Spirit".<a name=427:17></a> They commit now nationally the unpardonable sin.<a name=427:18></a> There is no repentance for the nation; never.<a name=427:19></a> There is repentance for the individual.<a name=427:20></a> Saul was at the stoning of Stephen, standing by.<a name=427:21></a> The new centre is now opened out, even in the new place where Christ is.<a name=427:22></a> There is no further offer to Israel; they have sent a message after him, saying, "We will not have this man to reign over us".<a name=427:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now you see that the new centre is from our Lord, rejected from the earth, but set down in the highest place in glory.<a name=427:24></a> It is from Christ in heaven that the mystery of the body was revealed.<a name=427:25></a> It is important to

	<div class="paragraph">
		The servant we find is first instructed; a very important principle here.<a name=428:9></a> Before Stephen suffered, he was instructed in the new order of things, and he in a moment apprehends the change, even that the seat of government is changed from Jerusalem to the right hand of God: a change of the utmost importance.<a name=428:10></a> Christendom has fixed the seat of government at Rome, the seat of the Roman power, the very power which was given to Noah, and descended to Israel, and when Israel forfeited it, it was given to the gentiles, who, in the person of Pilate, crucified Christ.<a name=428:11></a> Christendom has sought and courted this power; but eventually the nominal church will be cast out of Christ's mouth, then the beast (Rome) will carry the harlot.<a name=428:12></a> The first failure of the church was losing sight of the new centre in heaven.<a name=428:13></a> The new era is from the Lord in heaven, and the new power is the Holy Spirit sent down from heaven.<a name=428:14></a> Could anything more fully betray the strange fatuity, the deceitful influence, which swayed the church, than that Rome should be fixed upon as the seat of government, and that the secular power should be sought for and accepted to support the church, instead of the power of the Holy Spirit sent down from an exalted Christ, to connect us with Him in that place?<a name=428:15></a>

		"Being full of the Holy Spirit, having fixed his eyes on heaven, he saw the glory of God, and Jesus".<a name=429:22></a> Now turn to <a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#1:26">Ezekiel  1:26</a>: "And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne,

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Stephen turns round to his audience - it was not a mob, it was the council, the great religious body - and he announces to them the fulfilment of Ezekiel's vision.<a name=430:10></a> He says, I see the Son of man - he does not say Jesus - "I see.<a name=430:11></a>.<a name=430:12></a> .<a name=430:13></a> the Son of man standing on the right hand of God".<a name=430:14></a> Was that an outrage to the feelings of the religious under the law?<a name=430:15></a> Weigh the statement.<a name=430:16></a> How could it be offensive to men who boasted that they were God's people, to whom His word was given?<a name=430:17></a> You might have expected them to say, What a majestic thing, we are delighted to hear it, the Son of man in heaven!<a name=430:18></a> But instead of this, the statement evoked their worst hatred.<a name=430:19></a> "Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord".<a name=430:20></a> The devil's work - "whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer".<a name=430:21></a> Do you think the religious world has changed?<a name=430:22></a> Do you think you would get a better reception if you were to insist upon it to the religious world that there is a Man in heaven, and that is the Man for christians?<a name=430:23></a> "As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly".<a name=430:24></a> We are the one or the other.<a name=430:25></a> Thank God,

		I think it is very simple - that I am responsible to be descriptive of the Lord Jesus Christ as the exalted Man, in the scene where He was rejected.<a name=438:2></a> I read <a href="../bible/2Kings.htm#2:9">2 Kings  2:9</a>, to furnish an example of this testimony.<a name=438:3></a> Elijah is going away, and he says to Elisha, What shall I do for you?<a name=438:4></a> And Elisha answers, as it were, by saying, The only thing that would content me is a double portion of <i>your spirit</i>; because he is going to stand here for Elijah when he has gone away.<a name=438:5></a> I take this as an illustration, an incident which must touch every heart.<a name=438:6></a> If the Lord were to ask you what you would like best, would you not like to have a power commensurate with Himself, in order that you upon the earth might describe Him in His exaltation?<a name=438:7></a> There is one thing more.<a name=438:8></a> Elisha sees Elijah taken, he fulfils the condition.<a name=438:9></a> The same condition, in a measure, is required of us, and with us the power is given to carry it out; Stephen was made conscious of the blessedness of the new position before he uttered a word to anyone.<a name=438:10></a> I believe the lack with us is that we are not in conscious knowledge of our new position.<a name=438:11></a> Our power is according as we do know it; therefore the apostle in Ephesians first prays that the saints might have conscious knowledge of their great position.<a name=438:12></a> Our power down here is in proportion to the measure of our power to rise up to our position.<a name=438:13></a> You cannot descend in power, but as you have ascended.<a name=438:14></a> It is not a question merely of right, but the more it is your right, the more dependent you are on God for it.<a name=438:15></a> Hence the apostle prays that they may be "strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man; that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith".<a name=438:16></a> Thus you are endowed in your great position, and consequently: "Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, unto him be glory in the church".<a name=438:17></a> Then

		The great points for us to see are that the state of man because of the fall was not remediable, because the life which was forfeited was the very life of the condition in which man was set on earth; and this forfeit was the penalty, only really known after it was paid, and not in the mere act of dying, and hence the
