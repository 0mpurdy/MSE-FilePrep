		MUSINGS ON THE EPISTLE TO THE HEBREWS

	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapters 1 and 2
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The epistle to the Hebrews strikingly illustrates one quality of the Book of God.<a name=1:1></a> It may be read in various lights; yet no one ray interferes with another.<a name=1:2></a> In six or seven ways this epistle could be read with the greatest ease.<a name=1:3></a> I will specially look now at the first two chapters.<a name=1:4></a> It opens the heavens to you as they now are.<a name=1:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How blessed is the introduction of such a thing to the heart!<a name=1:6></a> You look up and see the physical heavens above you; but it is only the superficial heavens you see.<a name=1:7></a> This epistle introduces the inner heavens to you, and not in a physical, but in a moral character.<a name=1:8></a> It introduces us to the glories surrounding and attaching to the Lord Jesus, now accepted in the heavens.<a name=1:9></a> We are thus enabled to see the heavens in which He has sat down, what He is about there, and what will succeed those heavens.<a name=1:10></a> When the Lord Jesus was here, we learn in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#3">Matthew  3</a>, the heavens opened to get a sight of Him.<a name=1:11></a> There was an object here then worthy of the attention of the heavens.<a name=1:12></a> He returned - and the heavens had an object they had never known before - a glorified Man.<a name=1:13></a> And now it is the office of our epistle to show us the heavens as the place of this glorified Man.<a name=1:14></a> And as in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#3">Matthew  3</a>we get the heavens opened to look down at Christ here, so in the Hebrews you get the heavens opened that you may look up at Christ there.<a name=1:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But supposing you ask, Is that all the history of the heavens?<a name=2:1></a> Have you gone to the end?<a name=2:2></a> Indeed I have not.<a name=2:3></a> In chapters 4 and 5 of the Revelation, we get the heavens preparing for the judgment of the earth.<a name=2:4></a> Then at the close of the volume, I find the heavens not only the residence of the glorified Man, but of the glorified church.<a name=2:5></a> What a book it is that can present to us such secrets as these!<a name=2:6></a> It is a divine library.<a name=2:7></a> You take down one volume from your shelf, and read about the heavens; in another volume you read of man in ruins; take down a third and you read of God in grace; and so on, in precious, wondrous variety.<a name=2:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we will set ourselves down before chapters 1 and 2.<a name=2:9></a> "When he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high".<a name=2:10></a> That is just taking up the pledge I gave - that the epistle is going to open to us the heavens.<a name=2:11></a> The Lord has been here purging our sins, and He has gone up to occupy the heavens as the Purger of our sins.<a name=2:12></a> Supposing I had been to a distant country, I might describe it to you so as to fill you with delight, and with desire to visit it.<a name=2:13></a> But when the Holy Spirit comes and shows you the distant heavens, He does more than this - He shows you that your interests are consulted there.<a name=2:14></a> Our Representative is seated in the highest place, and seated there in that very character.<a name=2:15></a> Is it possible to have a more intimate link with the place?<a name=2:16></a> It is a wonder we are not all on the wing to get there as soon as we can!<a name=2:17></a> To think that because He came to die a wretched death for us, He is seated there!<a name=2:18></a> I defy you to have a richer interest in the heavens than God has given you.<a name=2:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in verse 4, we see that not only as the Purger of our sins, but in the verity of His Manhood He is there,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=3>[Page 3]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		seated above the angelic hosts.<a name=3:1></a> We have seen already what an interest we have in Him as the Purger of our sins.<a name=3:2></a> Now the chapter introduces Him to us as the Son of man above angels.<a name=3:3></a> Man has been preferred to angels.<a name=3:4></a> Man in the person of Christ has been seated above angels, though it be in Michael or in Gabriel.<a name=3:5></a> The whole of chapter 1 is thus occupied in giving you two sights of Christ in heaven.<a name=3:6></a> What two secrets they are!<a name=3:7></a> The Purger of our sins, and very Man, like ourselves, seated at the right hand of the Majesty on high.<a name=3:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I read the first four verses of chapter 2 as a parenthesis.<a name=3:9></a> Do not you like these parentheses?<a name=3:10></a> The Holy Spirit speaks for our understanding.<a name=3:11></a> We see friends when conversing together, turning a little aside to converse about one another; so the apostle speaks here - 'I am teaching you wonderful things.<a name=3:12></a> Do take heed that you let not such things fall on a careless ear'.<a name=3:13></a> We must not be mere scholars.<a name=3:14></a> If we are disciples of a living Master in the school of God, we shall have our consciences exercised while we are pursuing our lesson.<a name=3:15></a> That is what the apostle is doing here.<a name=3:16></a> That parenthesis falls on the ear most sweetly and acceptably.<a name=3:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But though a parenthesis, it opens a new glory to us.<a name=3:18></a> How the field of Scripture teems with fruit!<a name=3:19></a> It is not a thing you have to till diligently and get but little fruit.<a name=3:20></a> That parenthesis contains another glory of Christ.<a name=3:21></a> (Surely we ought not to need exhortation!<a name=3:22></a>) He is seated there as an Apostle - my Apostle.<a name=3:23></a> What does that mean?<a name=3:24></a> He is a preacher to me.<a name=3:25></a> God spake in times past by the prophets, He is speaking to us now by the Son; and Christ in the heavens is the Apostle of christianity.<a name=3:26></a> And what is His

	<div class="paragraph">
		subject?<a name=4:1></a> Salvation.<a name=4:2></a> That salvation which, as the Purger of our sins, He wrought out for us; and which, as the Apostle of our profession, He makes known to us.<a name=4:3></a> There is more furnishing of the heavens for you.<a name=4:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then verse 5 returns to the theme of chapter 1.<a name=4:5></a> It goes on with the distinctive glories of Christ, as super-eminent, above angels.<a name=4:6></a> "For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come".<a name=4:7></a> What is "the world to come"?<a name=4:8></a> It is the millennial age, which we read of in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>.<a name=4:9></a> We have three conditions of the Son of man here.<a name=4:10></a> "Thou madest him a little lower than the angels;" "thou crownedst him with glory and honour;" "and didst set him over the works of thy hands".<a name=4:11></a> So that the world to come is not put in subjection to angels, but to the Son of man.<a name=4:12></a> Now you find that you have an interest in this glorified Man.<a name=4:13></a> I was saying that if I went to a distant land and described to you its scenic wonders, you would desire a sight of them.<a name=4:14></a> But this epistle shows you that you have a personal interest in these glories.<a name=4:15></a> Is there a single point that the Son of man has travelled in which you have not an interest?<a name=4:16></a> The apostle traces it here for you.<a name=4:17></a> So that again I say this epistle is opening the distant heavens to your view, and showing you the glories that attach to Christ, and that you have an immediate, personal interest in those glories.<a name=4:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In verse 10 a new thought comes in, "to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings".<a name=4:19></a> Only pause here for a moment.<a name=4:20></a> It became the glory of God to give you a perfect Saviour.<a name=4:21></a> Do you believe it?<a name=4:22></a> What thoughts rise in the soul when we come to that!<a name=4:23></a> Are you in possession of Him, so that you never in a single thought are tempted to look beyond Him?<a name=4:24></a> We have got an

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		unquestionable, infallible salvation, one that will stand the shock of every coming day.<a name=5:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		From verse 11, we further see our interest in the glorified Man.<a name=5:2></a> "Both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren".<a name=5:3></a> Not ashamed!<a name=5:4></a> Tell it out that earth and heaven may hear!<a name=5:5></a> This glorified Man has brethren - the elect of God.<a name=5:6></a> He is "not ashamed", because of their dignity.<a name=5:7></a> Not merely because of His grace, but because of their personal dignity.<a name=5:8></a> He has appointed me a share of His own throne.<a name=5:9></a> Is He ashamed of His own doings - of His own adoptings?<a name=5:10></a> Do not get creeping, cold thoughts as you read Scripture.<a name=5:11></a> Our thoughts of Christ should be such as to take captive our old man - to bear us on eagles' wings.<a name=5:12></a> "In the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee".<a name=5:13></a> Christ raising and leading the song of the ransomed ones, and not ashamed to be found in their company!<a name=5:14></a> "And again, I will put my trust in him".<a name=5:15></a> He did that when He was here, and we do it now.<a name=5:16></a> "And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me".<a name=5:17></a> There is our interest in the glorified Man.<a name=5:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we return to see what He was in humiliation.<a name=5:19></a> "He took not on .<a name=5:20></a>.<a name=5:21></a>.<a name=5:22></a> angels; but he took on .<a name=5:23></a>.<a name=5:24></a>.<a name=5:25></a> the seed of Abraham".<a name=5:26></a> He left the angels where He found them.<a name=5:27></a> The angels excelled in strength.<a name=5:28></a> They kept their first estate, and He left them there.<a name=5:29></a> Man excelled in wickedness, and He came and linked Himself with man.<a name=5:30></a> Then verse 17 introduces us to another glory that attaches to Christ in the heavens.<a name=5:31></a> We see Him there as our High Priest, ever waiting with propitiation for sins, and succour for sorrows.<a name=5:32></a> The epistle teems with divine glories.<a name=5:33></a> It is massive in

	<div class="paragraph">
		glory, and ponderous in the divine thoughts that press into its short space.<a name=6:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapters 3 and 4
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We were observing that one leading characteristic of this epistle is that it gives us a look into heaven as it now is - not as it was in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>, and not as it will be in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#4">Revelation  4</a>or <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21">Revelation  21</a>.<a name=6:2></a> The heaven of <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1">Genesis  1</a>had no glorified Man in it, no Apostle, no High Priest.<a name=6:3></a> The heaven of Hebrews has all these.<a name=6:4></a> That being the general character of the epistle, we looked at the Lord Jesus as in that heaven.<a name=6:5></a> Then we were observing how the Lord is there as a glorified Man - as the Purger of our sins - as our Apostle preaching salvation, and as the High Priest making reconciliation for sins.<a name=6:6></a> Every page is fruitful in casting up the glories of the Lord Jesus, now in heaven.<a name=6:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we will take up chapters 3 and 4.<a name=6:8></a> Having been introduced to the heavens, where Christ is, and to the Christ that is in those heavens, chapters 3 and 4 turn a little round on themselves, and look a little sharply at us and tell us to take care now that we are travelling along the road in company with Him.<a name=6:9></a> The first thought is that we are to consider Him in His faithfulness.<a name=6:10></a> The exhortation here is commonly misunderstood.<a name=6:11></a> For what are we to consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession?<a name=6:12></a> Is it to imitate Him?<a name=6:13></a> The religious mind says so.<a name=6:14></a> But that is not the point of the passage at all.<a name=6:15></a> I am to consider Him as faithful, for my sake, to God; faithful so that I might be saved eternally.<a name=6:16></a> If I do not consider Him so, I have more than blunted the point of the passage, and lost the sense of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=7>[Page 7]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		grace.<a name=7:1></a> The word should be not "was faithful", but 'is faithful', or 'being faithful'.<a name=7:2></a> Not in walking down here, but now in heaven.<a name=7:3></a> I look up and see Him discharging these offices, faithful to Him that appointed Him.<a name=7:4></a> What business have I to imitate Him in His high priesthood?<a name=7:5></a> I am to consider Him for my comfort.<a name=7:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What a constellation of grace there is in all that!<a name=7:7></a> The grace of God that appointed Him, the grace of the Son that discharges the work, and the grace that opens chapter 3, is infinite in magnificence.<a name=7:8></a> Could there be more sublime exhortation, or more divine doctrine?<a name=7:9></a> We get the Son, in the highest heavens, there seated as the Purger of our sins, the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, and could any exhortation be more divine than that which tells me to sit still, and look at Him in His faithfulness up there?<a name=7:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in verses 3 and 4 and onward, we get further glories unfolded in contrast with Moses.<a name=7:11></a> The first dispensation is here called a house.<a name=7:12></a> It was a servant, to serve a coming Christ - Moses and the house are identical.<a name=7:13></a> All the activities of that dispensation were worth nothing if they did not bear testimony to a coming Christ: therefore it was a servant.<a name=7:14></a> When the Lord comes, on the other hand, He comes as a Son, to claim that which is His own as His own; and the whole thing now depends on this - will the house, over which He is set, be faithful to Him?<a name=7:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What is your faithfulness?<a name=7:16></a> To continue in confidence and hold the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end.<a name=7:17></a> 'Christ for me, Christ for me!<a name=7:18></a>' I will take nothing but this all-sufficient Christ.<a name=7:19></a> Cling to Him day by day, till the wilderness journey is over.<a name=7:20></a> Then you are part and parcel of that house over which He presides as a Son.<a name=7:21></a> He not only
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=8>[Page 8]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		presides over it, but He claims it as His own - a dearer thought.<a name=8:1></a> It is quite right to be subject to Him, but He tells you to lie near His heart.<a name=8:2></a> Faithfulness is not merely being subject to the headship of Christ.<a name=8:3></a> If I am lying on His bosom, then I am faithful.<a name=8:4></a> So that when the Spirit comes to exhort, in chapters 3 and 4, He has not left the high and wondrous ground of chapters 1 and 2.<a name=8:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, having come to that point, He turns aside to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#95">Psalm  95</a>.<a name=8:6></a> If you begin to read at <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#92">Psalm  92</a>and read to the close of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#101">Psalm  101</a>, you will find it a beautiful little millennial volume.<a name=8:7></a> It is exhortings and awakenings of the Spirit of faith in Israel, summoning them to look forward to the rest of God.<a name=8:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How is that brought in here?<a name=8:9></a> The wilderness journey of Israel is a beautiful, lively picture of the journey the believer is now taking from the cross to the glory.<a name=8:10></a> People sometimes, at the opening of chapter 4, turn it on themselves.<a name=8:11></a> But rest to the conscience is not the thing that is thought of at all.<a name=8:12></a> It assures us that we are out of Egypt and looking towards Canaan.<a name=8:13></a> The danger is, not lest the blood should not be on the lintel, but lest we should break down by the way, as thousands did in the wilderness.<a name=8:14></a> It never calls you to re-investigate the question of having found rest in the blood, but to take care how you travel along the road.<a name=8:15></a> When He speaks of rest, it is the rest of the kingdom He talks of, not the rest of the conscience.<a name=8:16></a> Then He calls the whole age through which we are passing one day - "To day".<a name=8:17></a> It was a short day to the dying thief, a short day to the martyred Stephen.<a name=8:18></a> A longer day to Paul, and a longer day still to John; but let the wilderness journey be short or long, it is one day, and you are to hold

	<div class="paragraph">
		by Christ to the very end.<a name=9:1></a> If you are to be partakers of Christ, you must hold fast to the end.<a name=9:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, what is the Christ of verse 14?<a name=9:3></a> A Christ crucified?<a name=9:4></a> No, Christ glorified.<a name=9:5></a> You are made partakers of Christ in the kingdom if you hold fast by Christ crucified.<a name=9:6></a> Let this "to day" ring in the heart and conscience every hour.<a name=9:7></a> Holding to a crucified Christ is my title to the rest of a glorified Christ.<a name=9:8></a> Two things contest this with you - sin and unbelief.<a name=9:9></a> Do you not recognise these two enemies as you pass along?<a name=9:10></a> Shall I continue in sin?<a name=9:11></a> Am I to give place to one wrong thought?<a name=9:12></a> I may be overtaken, but am I to treat them other than as enemies?<a name=9:13></a> Then unbelief is an action of the soul towards God.<a name=9:14></a> You and I do not know what saintly character is - what it is to be between Egypt and Canaan - if we are not aware that those two things stand out to withstand our passage every day.<a name=9:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 4 still pursues the subject.<a name=9:16></a> The Christ of chapter 3: 14 is the rest of chapter 4; Christ glorified - rest glorious.<a name=9:17></a> He has us out of Egypt.<a name=9:18></a> The exhortation attaches to a people out of Egypt.<a name=9:19></a> We have left the blood-sprinkled lintel behind.<a name=9:20></a> The glorious Canaan is before us.<a name=9:21></a> Take heed lest you come short of it.<a name=9:22></a> "Unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them".<a name=9:23></a> The gospel, not of the blood of Christ, but of the glory of Christ.<a name=9:24></a> It took one form in the ear of the Israelites and it takes another form to us; but to them, as to us, rest was preached.<a name=9:25></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then He beautifully falls back on the Sabbath rest of the Creator.<a name=9:26></a> The blessed Creator provided Himself a rest after creation.<a name=9:27></a> He promised Himself a rest in Canaan, after bringing them through the wilderness.<a name=9:28></a> Adam disturbed His creation-rest.<a name=9:29></a> Israel disturbed His Canaan-rest.<a name=9:30></a> Is He,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=10>[Page 10]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		therefore, disappointed in His rest?<a name=10:1></a> No; He has found it in Christ.<a name=10:2></a> The secret of the whole Book of God is, God retreating into Christ, when man in every way had disappointed Him.<a name=10:3></a> Christ is the One who has worked out that rest, and who holds it now, and it remains with Him both for God and for His saints.<a name=10:4></a> "Therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein".<a name=10:5></a> It is no longer a fallible thing, depending on Adam, or on Israel, therefore let us take care that we do not come short of it.<a name=10:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we get two ways in which to use Christ.<a name=10:7></a> We had two enemies in the end of chapter 3, now we have two uses of Christ in the end of chapter 4.<a name=10:8></a> We are to use Him as the Word of God, and as the High Priest of our profession.<a name=10:9></a> Is that the way I am using Him?<a name=10:10></a> These two uses stand opposed to sin and unbelief.<a name=10:11></a> Let the Word of God discern the thoughts and intents of the heart.<a name=10:12></a> Instead of giving place to your lusts and vanities, invite the entrance of the two-edged sword, that makes no allowance for a single bit of sin.<a name=10:13></a> And when you have dragged out the enemy - found some favourite lust lying in this corner, and some unsuspected vanity in that, what are you to do with them?<a name=10:14></a> Take them to Christ, and let His high priesthood dispose of them, in the mercy and grace that are in it.<a name=10:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There we pause for the present.<a name=10:16></a> We have seen the heavens opened, and looked in, and found there a Man arrayed in glories, every one of which I have an interest in.<a name=10:17></a> Then comes the exhortation.<a name=10:18></a> Two enemies beset you - take care.<a name=10:19></a> Instead of yielding to them, make use of the two-edged sword; and when you have found them out, take them to Jesus.<a name=10:20></a> There is a beautiful suitability between the Christ that is exhibited up above, in chapters 1 and 2,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapters 5 and 6
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We will read now to verse 10 of chapter 5; and from there until the close of chapter 6.<a name=11:2></a> We may observe that the apostle turns aside to a parenthetic warning.<a name=11:3></a> He is full of that style; and our style with one another is full of it.<a name=11:4></a> Such little breaks and interruptions in a discourse are always grateful to us.<a name=11:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first ten verses of chapter 5 a most weighty matter is introduced to our thoughts.<a name=11:6></a> In the first verse we get a general abstract thought of priesthood.<a name=11:7></a> It is that thing which serves men in their relationships to God.<a name=11:8></a> Then the character of service is presented to us - "That he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins;" that is, that He may both offer what is pleasing to God, and effect expiation for us before God.<a name=11:9></a> He stands to conduct our interest with God in whatever form.<a name=11:10></a> He is "taken from among men" that He can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way.<a name=11:11></a> He is not taken from among angels, therefore we read in Timothy, "the man Christ Jesus".<a name=11:12></a> God, in ordaining a Priest for us, has chosen One who can have compassion.<a name=11:13></a> We find at the close of chapter 7 that the Lord Jesus was separate from infirmity.<a name=11:14></a> But the priest here was one who by reason of infirmity could sympathise.<a name=11:15></a> The Lord Jesus had to learn how to sympathise, as well as to learn obedience by the things which He suffered.<a name=11:16></a>

		We are closing the epistle, and we get what is common in all the epistles - some little details.<a name=56:8></a> It is eminently the structure of Paul's epistles to begin with doctrine and close with exhortation.<a name=56:9></a> So it is here.<a name=56:10></a> "Let brotherly love continue".<a name=56:11></a> Then a brother may be a stranger.<a name=56:12></a> "Be not forgetful to entertain strangers".<a name=56:13></a> And to encourage them to that duty, they are reminded that some in their own history entertained angels unawares.<a name=56:14></a> Then another duty - "Remember them that are in bonds", and the encouragement follows - "as bound with them".<a name=56:15></a> Take your place in the body of Christ as His prisoners, not prisoners corporeally but mystically.<a name=56:16></a> When he speaks of suffering for Christ's sake, he appeals to you in your mystic place; but when he speaks of suffering adversity (verse 3) in a common, ordinary way, he appeals to natural life "as being yourselves also in the body".<a name=56:17></a>

		"Content with such things as ye have", not seeking to be richer tomorrow than today.<a name=57:1></a> Then the Lord speaks in verse 5, and you answer Him in verse 6.<a name=57:2></a> It is the response of faith to grace - the reply of the heart of the believer to the heart of the Lord God.<a name=57:3></a> Then comes the duty of subjection - "Remember them which have [or rather have had] the rule over you".<a name=57:4></a> Not a blind following of them, as when they were heathens (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:2">1 Corinthians  12:2</a>) following dumb idols.<a name=57:5></a> Are you to be led blindfolded?<a name=57:6></a> No; you are to be led intelligently.<a name=57:7></a> "No one can say, Lord Jesus, unless in the power of the Holy Spirit" (verse 3).<a name=57:8></a> We are living people of a living temple.<a name=57:9></a> So it is, "considering the end of their conversation".<a name=57:10></a> They died in faith, as they preached faith.<a name=57:11></a>

		Now he leaves all that and starts in verse 8 from another point; and this verse 8 may be called the motto of the epistle.<a name=57:12></a> Only in one light I grant.<a name=57:13></a> What I mean is that, as we have seen before, the Spirit of God in this epistle is looking at one thing after another - taking a passing glance at angels, at Moses, at Joshua, at Aaron, at the old covenant, at the altars with their victims, and setting every one of them aside to let in Christ.<a name=57:14></a> And you would not have it otherwise.<a name=57:15></a> With your whole heart and your whole soul you set your seal to that.<a name=57:16></a> Let all go to make room for Christ; and when Christ is brought in, do not let Him go for anything.<a name=57:17></a> This is what you get in verse 8.<a name=57:18></a> He is gazing for a moment at the object of the epistle.<a name=57:19></a> 'I have displaced everything to let Him in, and now keep Him before you'.<a name=57:20></a> It is a most blessed peroration of the whole teaching of the epistle.<a name=57:21></a>

		Now do not read verse 9 as if you could to some extent establish your heart with meats.<a name=58:6></a> Observe the punctuation; a semicolon after "grace", cuts it off from the close of the verse.<a name=58:7></a> Meats do nothing for you; as he tells you in another place - "Touch not; taste not; handle not" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:21">Colossians  2:21</a>).<a name=58:8></a> They bring neither profit nor honour to you.<a name=58:9></a> Suppose you accumulate carnal religious observances.<a name=58:10></a> If <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2">Colossians  2</a>tells me there is no honour in them, this tells me there is no profit in them.<a name=58:11></a> When probed and searched out, they are all to the satisfaction of the flesh.<a name=58:12></a> The moment I get the Lord brought in, I get the heart established in grace.<a name=58:13></a> Did you ever hear it remarked that not a single religion on earth takes grace as its secret, but the divine religion?<a name=58:14></a> It is keeping God quiet, if you can, with them all.<a name=58:15></a> God's religion is the only religion ever thought of that takes grace for its basis.<a name=58:16></a> This is exactly contemplated here.<a name=58:17></a> Do not be carried away with doctrines foreign to Christ.<a name=58:18></a>

		know sin as cancelled, blotted out, thrown behind the back; and there at your altar you are rendering a constant service of thanksgiving.<a name=59:1></a> But they that go back to the services of the tabernacle have no right, no competency, to stand as priests at the altar of this dispensation.<a name=59:2></a> Many a loved and loving soul is struggling with a legal mind, but that is a very different thing from displacing Christ for anything, as the Galatians were doing, putting a crutch under Him.<a name=59:3></a> The Spirit, in this epistle, does not quarrel with the poor struggling soul, but if you are seeking to offer expiatory sacrifices and not holding your altar diligently for praise Godward, you are blaspheming the sacrifice of the Son of God.<a name=59:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, having put you at your altar, and also within the holiest, he shows you your place outside the camp.<a name=59:5></a> Jesus was accepted in the holiest by God, and He was put outside the camp by men.<a name=59:6></a> You are to be with Christ in both these places.<a name=59:7></a> That is where this dispensation puts you; and if ever moral glory attached to a creature of God, it is that which attaches to you at this moment.<a name=59:8></a> Called outside the camp with Him to bear His reproach!<a name=59:9></a> Are angels in such conditions?<a name=59:10></a> Did He ever say to them, "Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22:28">Luke  22:28</a>)?<a name=59:11></a> Angels are never invited to be the companions of His sorrow.<a name=59:12></a> He has never put such honour on angels as on you.<a name=59:13></a> Therefore by-and-by the church will be nearer the throne than angels.<a name=59:14></a> "Here have we no continuing city".<a name=59:15></a> Christ had none.<a name=59:16></a>

		After this the apostle comes to those who have present rule.<a name=60:11></a> Those in verse 7 are those who had died.<a name=60:12></a> Is this a blind subjection, I ask again?<a name=60:13></a> No; you are to take knowledge of them.<a name=60:14></a> "They watch for your souls".<a name=60:15></a> Office without power, without the unction of the Holy Spirit, is a thing this dispensation does not know, and if we know of it, we have got into the corrupt element of it and out of God's element.<a name=60:16></a> It is a part of your fidelity to God to keep the dispensation in purity; and mere official authority is an idol.<a name=60:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This vessel of the Holy Spirit, this mightiest servant that ever served in God's name, comes down to the feeblest saint, "Pray for us", and he asks it on the authority of a good conscience.<a name=60:18></a> Could you ask another to pray for you if you were purposing to err?<a name=60:19></a> I will answer for it, you could not.<a name=60:20></a> And here it is on the ground of a good conscience that the apostle asks prayer.<a name=60:21></a> Then he gives them a subject of prayer.<a name=60:22></a> Oh!<a name=60:23></a> the familiarity of scripture!<a name=60:24></a> You are not taken out of your own world of affections and sympathies.<a name=60:25></a> Then he breaks out into his doxology.<a name=60:26></a> Now, if

	<div class="paragraph">
		The covenant is called "everlasting", because it is never to be displaced.<a name=61:10></a> The old covenant was put away.<a name=61:11></a> The new covenant is ever new, never abrogated.<a name=61:12></a> The blood is as fresh this moment to speak peace to the conscience as when the veil was rent.<a name=61:13></a> So when we come to daily life, we are brought down to be in all simplicity in company with the God of peace, that has raised the great Shepherd from the dead, by the blood that has sealed remission of sins for ever.<a name=61:14></a> So you may forget sin.<a name=61:15></a> In one great sense we shall remember it for ever, but as far as that which constitutes your condition before God you may forget it for ever.<a name=61:16></a>

		Conclusion
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may remember that I have observed several distinct lines of thought running through this epistle.<a name=62:4></a> In taking leave of it we may consider it and see how these various lines all meet in harmony, and give us in result a conclusion infinitely divine.<a name=62:5></a> The lines of thought are these:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(1) The Spirit is displacing one thing after another to let in Christ.<a name=62:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(2) Having brought in Christ, the Spirit holds Him up in the varied glories in which He is now filling the heavens.<a name=62:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(3) The Spirit shows how Christ, being brought in, acts on everything to perfect it; that whatever a glorified Christ touches He perfects: and, among other things, He perfects our consciences.<a name=62:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(4) This being so, on the ground of my reconciliation as a sinner I am introduced to a temple of praise.<a name=62:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These four things may be looked at independently, yet it is very blessed to see that they acquire fresh glory when seen in connection one with another.<a name=62:10></a> Now I do say there is a magnificence in such a divine writing that needs nothing but itself to tell its glory.<a name=62:11></a> I am in contact with something that is infinitely the mind of God, with some of the most wondrous discoveries that God can make of Himself to me.<a name=62:12></a> But ere we quit our sweet and happy task, we will look a little particularly at these four things.<a name=62:13></a> In chapters 1 and 2, the Spirit displaces angels to let in Christ.<a name=62:14></a> In
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=63>[Page 63]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		chapters 3 and 4, He displaces Moses and Joshua.<a name=63:1></a> In chapters 5, 6 and 7, He displaces Aaron.<a name=63:2></a> In chapter 8, He displaces the whole covenant with which Christ has nothing to do.<a name=63:3></a> In chapter 9, He displaces the ordinances of the old sanctuary, with its altars and services, to let in the altar where Jesus as the Lamb of God lay.<a name=63:4></a> One thing after another He takes up and sets aside, to make room for Jesus.<a name=63:5></a> This is a delightful task to the Spirit.<a name=63:6></a> God knows His own delights.<a name=63:7></a> If the Spirit can be grieved, He can be delighted too.<a name=63:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then having brought Christ in, what does He do with Him?<a name=63:9></a> He keeps Him in for ever.<a name=63:10></a> Christ has no successor.<a name=63:11></a> When the Spirit has brought Him in He gazes at Him.<a name=63:12></a> And what is it to be spiritual?<a name=63:13></a> It is to have the mind of the Holy Spirit.<a name=63:14></a> Have you ever delighted to get out of the house, to make room for Jesus?<a name=63:15></a> Indignantly the Spirit talks of the things we have been looking at as "beggarly elements".<a name=63:16></a> Have you ever treated them so?<a name=63:17></a> The Spirit sees no successor to Christ.<a name=63:18></a> In the counsels of God there is none after Him.<a name=63:19></a> Is it so in the counsels and thoughts of our souls?<a name=63:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So, having kept Him in, He gazes at Him.<a name=63:21></a> And what does He see in Him?<a name=63:22></a> He sees glory upon glory.<a name=63:23></a> In chapter 1, He sees Him seated at the right hand of the Majesty on high, as the Purger of our sins, and hears a voice saying, "Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever".<a name=63:24></a> He looks in chapter 2, and sees Him as our Apostle talking to us of salvation.<a name=63:25></a> Then He finds Him as the Owner of an abiding house, as the Giver of eternal rest, and sees Him in the sanctuary above, seated there with an oath, and hears Him uttering the salutation, "Thou art a priest for ever after the

	<div class="paragraph">
		order of Melchisedec".<a name=64:1></a> In these various ways the Spirit delights in Christ.<a name=64:2></a> Then in chapter 9, we see Him looked at in the heavens as the Bestower of the eternal inheritance, having first obtained eternal redemption.<a name=64:3></a> In chapter 10: 13, we see Him seated there in another character, with this voice saluting Him, "Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#110:1">Psalm  110:1</a>).<a name=64:4></a> Have you ever in spirit followed Christ up to heaven, and heard these voices addressing Him?<a name=64:5></a> We want to give personality to the truth.<a name=64:6></a> We are terribly apt to deal with it as mere dogma.<a name=64:7></a> I dread having it before me as a thing I could intellectually learn.<a name=64:8></a> In this epistle it is the Person that is kept before you; it is a living One you have to do with.<a name=64:9></a> These are heavenly realities.<a name=64:10></a> Moses pitched a temple in the wilderness.<a name=64:11></a> Solomon pitched a temple in the land.<a name=64:12></a> God has pitched a temple in heaven.<a name=64:13></a> And oh!<a name=64:14></a> how it shows what an interest God has in the sinner, when for our Priest He has built a sanctuary, and that because He is our Priest and about to transact our interests.<a name=64:15></a> Then in chapter 12, when He had ascended, He was received and seated in heaven as the Author and Finisher of faith.<a name=64:16></a> That is the second line, and we see how it hangs on the first.<a name=64:17></a> The Spirit, having fixed Christ before us, displays Him to us.<a name=64:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The third thing we get in this epistle is perfection.<a name=64:19></a> If I get Christ perfect as Saviour, I get myself perfect as saved.<a name=64:20></a> If I am not saved, Christ is not a Saviour.<a name=64:21></a> I am not speaking now of a feeble mind struggling with legality, but of my title - and I have no more doubt that I have a right to look on myself as a saved sinner than that Christ has a right to look on Himself as a perfect Saviour.<a name=64:22></a> Salvation is a relative thing.<a name=64:23></a> If I take myself as a sinner to Christ, and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		doubt that I am saved, I must have some doubt of the perfection of His Saviour-character.<a name=65:1></a> But we have already looked at the epistle as a treatise on perfection.<a name=65:2></a> It became God to give me none less than a perfect Saviour.<a name=65:3></a> Wondrous!<a name=65:4></a> He has linked His glory with the perfection of my conscience before Him.<a name=65:5></a> He has condescended to let me know that it became Him.<a name=65:6></a> Does it become you to come and serve me in some capacity?<a name=65:7></a> You might do it through kindness, but I should not think of saying so.<a name=65:8></a> Yet that is the language God uses.<a name=65:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So then, in the third place, we find the epistle a treatise on perfection.<a name=65:10></a> Not, however, the perfection of millennial days.<a name=65:11></a> Christ will be the Repairer of every breach.<a name=65:12></a> But the greatest breach of all was in the conscience of the sinner.<a name=65:13></a> There are mischief and confusion abroad in creation still.<a name=65:14></a> There is mischief abroad in the house of Israel.<a name=65:15></a> Christ has not yet set to His hand to repair that.<a name=65:16></a> There is a breach in the throne of David - Christ has not yet applied Himself to heal that.<a name=65:17></a> But the mightiest breach of all was between you and God.<a name=65:18></a> By-and-by He will turn the groans of creation into the praises of creation; but He began His character as a Repairer, by applying Himself to repair the breach that separated you from God; and now we have boldness to enter into the holiest.<a name=65:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then, in the fourth place, we find in this epistle the Spirit doing nothing less now than building a temple for praise.<a name=65:20></a> Is He about to mend the veil again, which God has rent?<a name=65:21></a> Is He going to revive the things that He has indignantly talked of as "beggarly elements"?<a name=65:22></a> Unspeakably glorious is this fourth and last thing.<a name=65:23></a> The

		Spirit of God has built a temple for you to praise Him - the fruit of your lips giving thanks to His name.<a name=66:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What have we not in this epistle?<a name=66:2></a> Though we may look on each line of thought independently, yet they do lend to each other exquisite and increased glory.<a name=66:3></a> The Spirit is, as it were, making a whip of small cords, and telling all to be gone to make room for Jesus.<a name=66:4></a> Of course I know they were willing to go.<a name=66:5></a> John the baptist uttered the voices of them all when he said, "He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:29">John  3:29</a>).<a name=66:6></a> Moses, Aaron, angels - all were delighted to be put out of the house for Christ.<a name=66:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These things are combinedly serving your soul by introducing you to deeper apprehensions of the Christ of God.<a name=66:8></a> What a Servant to our souls the Holy Spirit is in this dispensation - as the Lord Jesus was a Servant from the manger to Calvary.<a name=66:9></a> I believe we each need individually to be fortified with truth.<a name=66:10></a> We do not know how far Romanising and infidel errors may be getting ahead.<a name=66:11></a> If we have not the truth, we may be the sport of Satan tomorrow.<a name=66:12></a> I will give you an instance of it.<a name=66:13></a> The Galatians were an earnest, excited people (and I do not quarrel with revival excitement); they would have plucked out their eyes for the apostle, but the day came when he had to begin afresh with them from the very beginning.<a name=66:14></a> "My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:19">Galatians  4:19</a>).<a name=66:15></a> There was excitement without a foundation of truth; and when mischief came in, the poor Galatians were next door to shipwreck - and this epistle is

		And now what shall we say?<a name=67:5></a> O the depth of the riches!<a name=67:6></a> O the height of the glory - the profoundness of the grace - the wonder of the wonders - God unfolding Himself in such a way that we may well cover our faces, while we trust Him in silence and love Him with the deepest emotions of our souls!<a name=67:7></a> But some of us can surely say, "My leanness, my leanness" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#24:16">Isaiah  24:16</a>).<a name=67:8></a>

		THE HOLY CITY JERUSALEM AND ITS POLITICAL INFLUENCE IN THE COMING DAY

	<div class="paragraph">
		The great political influence in the future day will be the holy city, Jerusalem, the bride of the Lamb.<a name=69:1></a> With this thought in view, I would like, with God's help, to bring before you the striking correspondence between the church, as here set forth in the symbol of the holy city, and Christ Himself, the Lamb, whose bride she is.<a name=69:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ was both inclusive and exclusive.<a name=69:3></a> He was inclusive, for He embraced everything that is blessed and beautiful.<a name=69:4></a> Nothing whatever was wanting in Christ that God could delight in, and which He would have man to be.<a name=69:5></a> The world could never produce a man like Christ.<a name=69:6></a> Christ was everything and had everything.<a name=69:7></a> Every moral grace and good was there, nothing was lacking.<a name=69:8></a> He fully expressed God and what was of God.<a name=69:9></a> The more the disciples listened to Him the more they were amazed to find how blessed He was.<a name=69:10></a> Each day He seemed to be more wonderful than the day before.<a name=69:11></a> In Him, God Himself was "manifested in flesh".<a name=69:12></a> Christ was the embodiment of all the good and of all the grace that is in the heart of God for man, and all that good was perfectly expressed in <i>Man</i>.<a name=69:13></a> He was entirely of God, the heavenly Man, the Man out of heaven.<a name=69:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On the other hand, Christ was the most exclusive Man the world has ever seen.<a name=69:15></a> He excluded everything that was of the world.<a name=69:16></a> He would have none of its thoughts and ideas
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=70>[Page 70]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and none of its ways.<a name=70:1></a> The world can never boast that they <i>made</i> that Man.<a name=70:2></a> And indeed the world has never made a man for God, nor can it do.<a name=70:3></a> Whatever we have learnt from the world we have to unlearn when we come to Christ, and learn of Him.<a name=70:4></a> His thoughts were in direct opposition to the thoughts of the world.<a name=70:5></a> The world never educated Christ.<a name=70:6></a> He brought all that marked Him from heaven, from God, who was the true spring of all His precious thoughts and His blessed ways.<a name=70:7></a> He was absolutely exclusive of all that is in the world - whether it was the lust of the flesh, or the lust of the eyes, or the pride of life.<a name=70:8></a> He was exclusive of its pride and self-importance, its ambition and its vanity.<a name=70:9></a> He would have nothing of its evil, nothing of its lying and deceiving character, nothing of its hatred, nothing of its lust.<a name=70:10></a> He had nothing to say to its violence nor to its corruption.<a name=70:11></a> He was the very opposite of all that the world is.<a name=70:12></a> Who was ever so gentle as Christ?<a name=70:13></a> Who was so full of love and grace?<a name=70:14></a> Who was so meek and lowly?<a name=70:15></a> Who was so dependent and confident in God?<a name=70:16></a> Who was so faithful?<a name=70:17></a> Who was so righteous and true?<a name=70:18></a> In every way He was the delight and pleasure of God, inclusive of all that is of God, but exclusive of all else.<a name=70:19></a> He was essentially the Holy One and the True, righteous in the midst of unrighteousness, godly in the midst of godlessness.<a name=70:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Naturally we do not like the idea of exclusiveness.<a name=70:21></a> But Christ was also <i>inclusive</i>, inclusive of all that is truly beautiful, of everything that has real value and worth, and He distributed liberally on every hand.<a name=70:22></a> He came into a world of need with grace to meet every bit of it.<a name=70:23></a> He had all the sweet light of God to give to man.<a name=70:24></a> He never lived to Himself or for Himself.<a name=70:25></a> He lived to God, and for God.<a name=70:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=71>[Page 71]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Though greater than all, He came lower than any in order to serve, and to give Himself a ransom for all.<a name=71:1></a> He loved to communicate; and with the utmost patience He taught His disciples, and so He does still.<a name=71:2></a> All who are truly taught of Him become like Him, and soon will come with Him from heaven, in the character of the holy city, in order to exercise their holy political influence for the blessing of the whole world.<a name=71:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now let us consider the inclusive character of the city - what she is and what she has.<a name=71:4></a> As the bride of the Lamb the city corresponds with Christ and is like Him.<a name=71:5></a> And first, Jerusalem is a holy city.<a name=71:6></a> This is in striking contrast to the unholy cities of this world, and the politics of today.<a name=71:7></a> Christ is "the Holy One", and therefore it must be a holy city.<a name=71:8></a> All who form it are taught to abhor evil, and to follow after holiness.<a name=71:9></a> The Holy Spirit is given us that we may be holy, and thus like Christ.<a name=71:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next, the city is seen "Coming down out of the heaven from God".<a name=71:11></a> The city is heavenly, and its origin is God.<a name=71:12></a> This is another feature of Christ.<a name=71:13></a> He was the heavenly Man, and He came from God, and "such as the heavenly one, such also the heavenly ones" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:48">1 Corinthians  15:48</a>).<a name=71:14></a> What wonderful influence we should have even now, if every morning we came down, as it were, from heaven, from God, to illuminate men with the light of Christ!<a name=71:15></a> The church did so at the beginning, when all were in the power of the Holy Spirit, and individually we may do so now.<a name=71:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This brings out another thought - the city has the glory of God and a shining most precious.<a name=71:17></a> Her shining was "as a crystal-like jasper stone".<a name=71:18></a> Now in chapter 4 the jasper stone is descriptive of Christ, so that the church has the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=72>[Page 72]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		glory of God and the shining of Christ.<a name=72:1></a> Christ Himself is the glory of God, and was so when on earth.<a name=72:2></a> He revealed God fully, and God was glorified in Him.<a name=72:3></a> Christ was also the light of the world, the great light to lighten every man.<a name=72:4></a> Never before had there been such precious light.<a name=72:5></a> So the church will come out of heaven having the glory of God and a shining most precious.<a name=72:6></a> We find too in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:21">Ephesians  3:21</a>, there will be glory to God "in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages".<a name=72:7></a> The heavenly city then will bring the glory of God to the nations, and the shining of Christ.<a name=72:8></a> How sweetly will that light influence the whole world in the coming day, diffused, as it will be, through myriads of saints!<a name=72:9></a> May we have grace to do so in some measure even now!<a name=72:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next, we read the city has "a great and high wall".<a name=72:11></a> The wall is for defence, and to keep out evil.<a name=72:12></a> It was of jasper and therefore like unto Christ, and presents that holy nature which repels instantly, and with abhorrence, everything that is not in accord with Christ.<a name=72:13></a> "Every one begotten of God does not sin, but he that has been begotten of God keeps himself, and the wicked one does not touch him" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:18">1 John  5:18</a>).<a name=72:14></a> It is the saving character of the divine nature which allows no evil to penetrate.<a name=72:15></a> "Thou shalt call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#60:18">Isaiah  60:18</a>).<a name=72:16></a> God has called us to the fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ our Lord, and this fellowship is to keep out evil and to protect the interests of Christ down here, and to share in the wonderful privileges and blessings connected with Him.<a name=72:17></a> But it necessitates the fellowship of His death, so that we do not live in that to which Christ died.<a name=72:18></a> We are thus drawn together away from the world and sin, and by

		<a name=73>[Page 73]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the Holy Spirit are bound together in holy fellowship.<a name=73:1></a> Christians need such help in a world opposed to Christ.<a name=73:2></a> They are not meant to walk absolutely alone, as if there were no others who love the Lord.<a name=73:3></a> We need the help of one another.<a name=73:4></a> Now the walls present to my mind that inner work of a defensive and protective character which is wrought in our souls by the Holy Spirit, without which fellowship would only be an empty name.<a name=73:5></a> Christ knew nothing whatever of sin, His holy nature was absolutely opposed to it.<a name=73:6></a> If then Christ is in us, we have a new nature which is abhorrent of evil and will have nothing to say to it.<a name=73:7></a> The wall is twelve times twelve cubits high.<a name=73:8></a> No sin or evil of any kind can get in, and this wall is now being built in the souls of God's people by the Holy Spirit, and can never be thrown down.<a name=73:9></a> It is insuperable and impregnable.<a name=73:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The number twelve in Scripture expresses perfection in service or administration.<a name=73:11></a> It occurs twelve times in the description of the holy city, if we count the length, breadth and height as separate twelves.<a name=73:12></a> Thus the great thought of the city is administration and service in the day to come, when she will distribute all the goodness of God for the benefit of man.<a name=73:13></a> The city has twelve gates, that is perfection in accessibility.<a name=73:14></a> No matter from what point you approach the city, you find a gate.<a name=73:15></a> It is accessible to all men.<a name=73:16></a> No one was ever so easy to approach as was Christ.<a name=73:17></a> And He is still.<a name=73:18></a> And it should be just as easy to approach us.<a name=73:19></a> The Lord teaches His people to put themselves at the service of the poorest and the most needy.<a name=73:20></a> None were too lowly or outcast for Christ to serve, and He encourages us to do the same.<a name=73:21></a> Often have heavily burdened souls found that they could approach christians, when they could approach no

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		one else.<a name=74:1></a> How blessed to think we may be accessible to any poor sinner who has a need, and that it is for us to serve them and to tell them of the love of God.<a name=74:2></a> We are left here for that very purpose, that we may give to any and every one the sweet light of Christ, and bring the gospel within reach of all men.<a name=74:3></a> There were three gates on each of the four sides that the gospel might go out to all, and that no one might have to go away because he could not find a gate.<a name=74:4></a> In the future day the city will be within reach of the whole world, and all nations will find easy access into the good of the city and into the blessing of God.<a name=74:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing brought before us is that at the gates were twelve angels.<a name=74:6></a> Angels, though now unseen, have a blessed service in guarding the Lord's people.<a name=74:7></a> So that we have here perfection in providential care.<a name=74:8></a> Angels were constantly seen in the Jewish dispensation protecting and guarding the saints, or opening prison doors, rendering some outward assistance to the Lord's earthly people.<a name=74:9></a> And they still serve us though unseen.<a name=74:10></a> <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:14">Hebrews  1:14</a> says: "Are they not all ministering spirits, sent out for service on account of those who shall inherit salvation?<a name=74:11></a>" The Lord, too, says of infants, "their angels in the heavens continually behold the face of my Father who is in the heavens" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:10">Matthew  18:10</a>).<a name=74:12></a> We little know how the objects of God's love are cared for in this way.<a name=74:13></a> Angels will have their recognition in the coming day.<a name=74:14></a> They have, for nearly two thousand years, cared for and protected God's people providentially, and they are at the gates in the day of glory.<a name=74:15></a> They will escort the city when it descends from heaven.<a name=74:16></a> Though in a somewhat different way, they will serve Christ and those who are Christ's.<a name=74:17></a> They will ever be at the

	<div class="page-number">

	<div class="paragraph">
		bidding of Christ.<a name=75:1></a> They are "mighty in strength, that execute his word, hearkening unto the voice of his word" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#103:20">Psalm  103:20</a>).<a name=75:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Further, I would notice that on the gates were inscribed the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel.<a name=75:3></a> God can never forget Israel.<a name=75:4></a> It is from them that we got our light at the beginning of the gospel, for the first preachers were all Israelites, and so too the first converts.<a name=75:5></a> Also the history of the children of Israel was written for our instruction.<a name=75:6></a> Further, there will not only be a wonderful heavenly rule in the day of glory, but there will be perfection in earthly administration by means of the twelve tribes of Israel, who will occupy the first place on earth, and form twelve great nations.<a name=75:7></a> Israel will get its greatness and glory from Christ through the heavenly Jerusalem.<a name=75:8></a> They will be the first to get the good and blessing of the holy city, and they in turn will become a blessing to the nations, and all who bless them will be blessed.<a name=75:9></a> They will love God with all their heart, and their neighbour as themselves, and be the centre of blessing on the earth.<a name=75:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, the wall of the city has twelve foundations.<a name=75:11></a> Everything at the present moment is unstable.<a name=75:12></a> Men's hearts are failing them for fear.<a name=75:13></a> Things that seemed perfectly safe are giving way.<a name=75:14></a> But the walls of the holy city are marked by perfection in stability.<a name=75:15></a> Very soon there will be a general shaking of everything.<a name=75:16></a> "For thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land; and I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come" (<a href="../bible/Haggai.htm#2:6">Haggai  2:6</a>, 7).<a name=75:17></a> And this means "the removing of what is shaken, as being made, that what is
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=76>[Page 76]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		not shaken may remain" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:27">Hebrews  12:27</a>).<a name=76:1></a> Christians receive a kingdom which cannot be shaken.<a name=76:2></a> The city cannot be shaken.<a name=76:3></a> Christ can never be overthrown, and never has been, great though the failure of our testimony has been.<a name=76:4></a> Christ still remains as precious and as faithful as ever to His people, and He is absolutely reliable.<a name=76:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next we read that on the foundations are the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.<a name=76:6></a> The Lord entrusted the apostles with the testimony to give to us.<a name=76:7></a> He gave them the words which the Father gave Him, and they received them, and they have ministered them to the saints.<a name=76:8></a> Then it was given to Paul to complete the word of God.<a name=76:9></a> We get, therefore, here, the thought of perfection in testimony.<a name=76:10></a> Centuries have gone by, but nothing has been added to apostolic testimony.<a name=76:11></a> The church has been built upon it, upon their presentation of God as revealed in Christ.<a name=76:12></a> Nothing can be added to Paul's gospel.<a name=76:13></a> The whole light of a Saviour God was preached at the beginning, and nothing has been added to it since apostolic days.<a name=76:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next, we come to the measurement of the city.<a name=76:15></a> It is a golden measure that is used, for God only can truly measure things.<a name=76:16></a> The measure must be divinely right.<a name=76:17></a> And it is the measure of <i>a man</i>.<a name=76:18></a> The city can never rise to Deity, it must keep its true place, and Christ as Man is the only standard of measurement according to God.<a name=76:19></a> There can be no exaggeration, no making great what is small, nor making small what is great.<a name=76:20></a> We get here perfection in symmetry.<a name=76:21></a> There is nothing which protrudes nor which offends the eye, for there was nothing uneven in Christ.<a name=76:22></a> The city is a perfect cube and absolutely and entirely the work of God.<a name=76:23></a> The length, breadth, and height are each
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=77>[Page 77]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		twelve thousand stadia.<a name=77:1></a> It is far beyond any other city in measurement.<a name=77:2></a> It surpasses everything.<a name=77:3></a> It is God's greatest work, for it is the full setting forth of Christ.<a name=77:4></a> It is fifteen hundred miles high, whereas the wall is only about two hundred and fifty feet high.<a name=77:5></a> This shows that the greatest thought is not salvation, nor power to protect itself from evil, for Christ goes far beyond that.<a name=77:6></a> So, too, the city expresses a much greater thought than that of the wall.<a name=77:7></a> In every direction it measures twelve thousand stadia, and it sets forth the perfection of Christ.<a name=77:8></a> There Christ is set forth in all His greatness.<a name=77:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, the city is pure gold, like pure glass.<a name=77:10></a> Even the street of it is pure gold, as transparent glass.<a name=77:11></a> That is, the public highway is marked by divine righteousness and transparency.<a name=77:12></a> It is through and through what Christ was and is.<a name=77:13></a> There is no part dark.<a name=77:14></a> The saints are made righteous as He is righteous, and "created in truthful righteousness and holiness" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:24">Ephesians  4:24</a>).<a name=77:15></a> Nothing less will satisfy the thought of God.<a name=77:16></a> Christ, who "knew not sin he has made sin for us, that <i>we</i> might become God's righteousness in Him" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:21">2 Corinthians  5:21</a>).<a name=77:17></a> Both publicly and privately, as the street and the inner part of the city indicate, the church becomes the full expression of the righteousness of God.<a name=77:18></a> If the question be asked - How could God put sinners in heaven?<a name=77:19></a> the heavenly saints will give the answer, for there will not be a trace of sin about us, or in us, then, nothing whatever to show that we had ever been sinners.<a name=77:20></a> We shall be, in Christ, the perfect expression of God's righteousness in putting sin away in the sacrifice of Christ, who was made sin for us.<a name=77:21></a> The heavenly company will not be sinners.<a name=77:22></a> They will be absolutely abhorrent of sin and perfectly

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=78>[Page 78]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		righteous.<a name=78:1></a> We shall be entirely like Christ, and a grand proof to the universe of how completely God has put away sin in the death of Christ, and has satisfied all the claims of His righteousness.<a name=78:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would say again, that great though the wall is, and high, the city is greater and higher still.<a name=78:3></a> It is blessed to be saved and to be impregnable against evil, but it is a greater thought that we should be in every respect like Christ and for the delight of God.<a name=78:4></a> What a wonderful day it will be when myriads of saints, in the image and likeness of Christ, reflect His glory for the blessing of the earth.<a name=78:5></a> At the present moment Christ is but feebly seen in us christians, but He is seen in no others, for none but true christians can bring the rays of a living Christ into this dark world.<a name=78:6></a> All others speak and act like the world, for they are of the world.<a name=78:7></a> Soon the whole world will be filled with His glory.<a name=78:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next, we find that the foundations are adorned with twelve kinds of precious stones.<a name=78:9></a> "The first foundation, jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald; the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprasus; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst".<a name=78:10></a> Here we have then perfection in what is precious and valuable.<a name=78:11></a> Everything that has moral value and worth is found there, as was the case with Christ Himself, and is still.<a name=78:12></a> Nothing whatever was wanting in Him.<a name=78:13></a> All grace was there, everything that God could value.<a name=78:14></a> There was more value in Him when down here than there was in the whole world put together.<a name=78:15></a> He presented everything that is precious in the eye of God, and that in striking contrast to the world.<a name=78:16></a> Babylon, the false church, is built upon every

		vile and worthless principle, on selfishness, pride and lust of all kinds, and will fall in one moment when its day of judgment comes.<a name=79:1></a> But Jerusalem, the true church, is founded in everything that is precious, as set forth in Christ, and now in those who are Christ's, at least in the measure in which they are like to Him.<a name=79:2></a> It will be the most valuable building in the universe, because it will resemble Christ more closely than any other.<a name=79:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Next we read that the twelve gates were twelve pearls.<a name=79:4></a> "Each one of the gates, respectively, was of one pearl".<a name=79:5></a> This sets forth perfection of beauty.<a name=79:6></a> At whichever gate you approach the city, you are struck by its amazing beauty.<a name=79:7></a> It is unparalleled.<a name=79:8></a> There was never such beauty seen in this world before as was seen in Christ.<a name=79:9></a> But it needed anointed eyes to see it.<a name=79:10></a> In the eyes of the blinded Jews there was "no beauty" that they should desire Him.<a name=79:11></a> There was no halo round His head, as is falsely represented in pictures.<a name=79:12></a> But there was a moral halo, an indescribable moral beauty which at once marked Him off from every other man.<a name=79:13></a> See, for instance, how, in contrast to the bitterest hatred round Calvary's cross, the beauty of His spirit shone out in the words: "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#23:34">Luke  23:34</a>).<a name=79:14></a> Similar beauty too, marked the early christians.<a name=79:15></a> The words of Stephen when they were stoning him to death, illustrate this: "Lord, lay not this sin to their charge" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7:60">Acts  7:60</a>).<a name=79:16></a> There is a beautiful spirit about christians who live and walk under the influence of Christ, which at once attracts those who are seeking light.<a name=79:17></a> The only approach to the city to get the good and blessing of it is by means of the gates of pearl, the beautiful testimony of Christ.<a name=79:18></a> Christ sold all that He had to buy the church, the

		The thought of response is on my mind.<a name=83:1></a> We see that feature - as every other feature - perfectly in the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=83:2></a> When He was here upon earth, for the first time God had One here who yielded Him full and perfect response in every word, in every movement, in every motive of His heart.<a name=83:3></a> It is touching to think of what the Lord turned into account in praise to God; the books of Psalms show that He would turn even His abandonment by God into praise.<a name=83:4></a> Think of His turning the very hiding of God's face from Him into a theme for praise.<a name=83:5></a> If cities refused His ministry, if He felt their turning from Him, it says, that, "At that time, Jesus answering said, I praise thee, Father, Lord of the heaven and of the earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11:25">Matthew  11:25</a>).<a name=83:6></a> He "<i>answering</i> said .<a name=83:7></a>.<a name=83:8></a>".<a name=83:9></a> He was giving a response to God.<a name=83:10></a> What a word for us if we are found in a complaining spirit!<a name=83:11></a> Jesus turned the very hostility, the very refusal of precious ministry, into account in praising God, and taking up thankfully the babes.<a name=83:12></a>

		I read from the prophet Hosea, feeling how interesting is the way in which God begets response in a day of failure and breakdown.<a name=84:8></a> Things could not have been much worse, things were so bad publicly, that the prophet has to be told to take as wife a harlot, a worthless woman.<a name=84:9></a> God's servants are to be sympathetic with God in His feelings: Hosea was to have the feelings of God over faithless Israel, and by the commandment of God he takes this woman, and by the commandment of God he names the first child Jizreel.<a name=84:10></a> God had fixed the name of that boy - his name means, '<i>God</i> soweth'.<a name=84:11></a> Then the second child is born - a girl - and she is named by the commandment of God, Lo-ruhamah, - not having obtained mercy.<a name=84:12></a> Then the third child is born - a boy - and he is called Lo-ammi - not my people.<a name=84:13></a> Could things be worse?<a name=84:14></a> They correspond, I believe, with the outward position today religiously, and, lest we should be caught in the spirit of it we are to <i>feel</i> the position, we are to have our part, as Hosea had, in feeling how heartless is the public profession.<a name=84:15></a>

		Then God comes in, for His prerogative is to have mercy.<a name=85:1></a> He comes in on His own side.<a name=85:2></a> He had had that first boy named 'God soweth'.<a name=85:3></a> Why should we be together here, freed from much that is religious?<a name=85:4></a> We must trace it to God's sovereign activities.<a name=85:5></a> Why should I have been freed from what has laid hold of so many?<a name=85:6></a> Because God sovereignly, from His own side, comes in.<a name=85:7></a> 'God soweth', and here is this little remnant, Jizreel, and the prophet is able to continue to speak of universal blessing.<a name=85:8></a> In some ways Hosea is as wide as any of the prophets, for he speaks of universal blessing coming in.<a name=85:9></a> How will the millennium be ushered in?<a name=85:10></a> Not automatically; it will come in in answer to those who cry to God.<a name=85:11></a> The heavens "shall hear the earth; and the earth shall hear the corn, and the new wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Jizreel", and God comes in in blessing.<a name=85:12></a> "I will sow her unto me in the land; and I will have mercy upon Lo-ruhamah; and I will say to Lo-ammi, Thou art my people; and they shall say, My God".<a name=85:13></a> Well, one loves to think of that moment when here on earth, actually here, there shall be demonstrated what it is for creation to respond to God, as in connection with those on earth who know Him: "they shall hear Jizreel".<a name=85:14></a>

		So, at the end of this prophet, you get a most touching suggestion of this intimate conversation between Ephraim and God.<a name=85:15></a> "Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols?<a name=85:16></a>" God says, "I answer him, and I will observe him".<a name=85:17></a> Ephraim says to God, "I am like a green fir-tree", and God replies, "From me is thy fruit found".<a name=85:18></a> The better translation makes the speakers clear: Ephraim speaks, God replies; Ephraim responds, God acknowledges that

		Oh, how blessed to have an entrance into a world of <i>moral</i> values, to meet the achievements of man by retiring into the blessed knowledge of a God who shows mercy; to find an outlet for our feelings at a gospel preaching; in a God who can bring sinners to repentance; a greater work than any achievement of man's mind or hand!<a name=86:12></a> We need to be judging ourselves as to the spirit of what is here; the tendency is to turn back to Egypt, to rely on horses, on the power of the flesh; its weakness has been demonstrated - "The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15:21">Exodus  15:21</a>).<a name=86:13></a> I need to keep myself in self-judgment to watch that I do not go back to trust in what the death of Christ has severed me from.<a name=86:14></a> Then, as I say, at the very end of this book we have this touching conversation.<a name=86:15></a>

		What does it mean to be "like a green fir-tree?<a name=87:1></a>" I suppose this figure is taken up by the Spirit of God to demonstrate the possibility of being in a hostile atmosphere; in circumstances and surroundings that are against life, and yet be the expression of freshness, having life in oneself.<a name=87:2></a> The fir-tree has life in itself - the cold, the snow, the frost do not damage the fir-tree.<a name=87:3></a> Ephraim says, "I am like a green fir-tree;" God says, "From me is thy fruit found".<a name=87:4></a> It seems in Scripture as if the very best is reserved for the end.<a name=87:5></a> It seems, beloved brethren, as if we who have come in as eleventh-hour men come in for the very best.<a name=87:6></a> We have one of the brightest rays in the Old Testament right at the end, a handful of people thinking of Jehovah's name, speaking often one to another; thinking on His name, remembering Him.<a name=87:7></a> And we see God's appreciation of it, for He says, "I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him" (<a href="../bible/Malachi.htm#3:17">Malachi  3:17</a>).<a name=87:8></a> God was about to have the supreme delight of seeing that blessed One in manhood, who should come in and fully express God, One who should serve Him as a Son; and He accredits that little remnant at the end with that very character of service.<a name=87:9></a> Is the day difficult?<a name=87:10></a> Let us be like this remnant, let us feel the conditions.<a name=87:11></a> The Lord Jesus wants us to feel more intimately the state of the public profession of His name, the heartlessness as to His interests, but to encourage us to lay hold of Him in the sense of the sovereignty of what God will sow.<a name=87:12></a>

		We were dwelling together this afternoon on the thought of hospitality.<a name=105:1></a> And seeking to encourage one another in providing those features in keeping with Peter's ministry in sobriety.<a name=105:2></a> And in keeping with the widowhood of the assembly here, as Paul held it in his heart - a widow who yet brings up children, who shows hospitality, who washes the saints' feet; and in keeping with John.<a name=105:3></a> Hospitality according to John would give us to be found with spiritual discernment as to those who are moving in keeping with the Name.<a name=105:4></a>

		One desires now to dwell on this thought of entertaining divine Persons, of providing what gives pleasure to Them.<a name=105:5></a> It says of Benjamin in the blessings in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#33:12">Deuteronomy  33:12</a>, "The beloved of Jehovah, - he shall dwell in safety by him; He will cover him all the day long, And dwell between his shoulders".<a name=105:6></a> That is, God will dwell between the shoulders of Benjamin.<a name=105:7></a> It is no doubt a prophetic reference to the mountains that came in Benjamin's portion of the land, in the centre of which was Jerusalem.<a name=105:8></a> Think of God committing Himself to Benjamin, covering him all the day long, and then dwelling complacently between the shoulders of Benjamin.<a name=105:9></a> That is why God reveals Himself.<a name=105:10></a> He comes out in the expression of His own love, and so secures what is great enough to

		How blessed were God's thoughts in relation to this man Abraham, who sits in the entrance of his tent in the heat of the day!<a name=106:3></a> Some of us tend to put off christianity as we go to our work, and to put it on again as we are free, but our work and our life of responsibility here are to be part of the testimony.<a name=106:4></a> I am to be ready in the heat of the day.<a name=106:5></a> Abraham is restful as he waits for this divine visitation.<a name=106:6></a> Three men come to him.<a name=106:7></a> When he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door.<a name=106:8></a> The tent door is blessed, but we are to prove God in our circumstances and to come out as conquerors, as facing responsibility and meeting it, and yet restful for what divine love may disclose, and then vigilant, alert, mobile, as occasion requires.<a name=106:9></a> Abraham bowed himself to the earth, and he said, "Lord".<a name=106:10></a> What stature there is with this man!<a name=106:11></a> There are three men, but he says, "Lord".<a name=106:12></a> He recognises One is distinctive.<a name=106:13></a> He speaks to One.<a name=106:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not think we could exhaust the greatness of what is here.<a name=106:15></a> It is a matter for contemplation, indeed for worship, for God is visiting this man and is visiting him in a man's form, drawing near to Abraham in a way that he understands.<a name=106:16></a> Abraham says, "Lord, if now I have found favour in thine eyes, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant.<a name=106:17></a> Let now a little water be fetched, that ye may wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree".<a name=106:18></a> A greater than Abraham was to think of refreshment for the feet: a greater than Abraham was to lay aside His garments and gird Himself with a linen towel and serve those He loved as He washed their feet.<a name=106:19></a>

		What must it have meant to God to find these sensibilities with Abraham!<a name=107:1></a> He says, "I will fetch a morsel of bread; and refresh yourselves; after that ye shall pass on; for therefore have ye passed on towards your servant".<a name=107:2></a> It is as if to say, I know that the divine pleasure is concerned with others, and with other things.<a name=107:3></a> I know that you are only calling on me; but let me hold you, let me do something for your comfort.<a name=107:4></a> You stood within my range to see if I would hold you, but wait while I provide something.<a name=107:5></a> Let me keep you.<a name=107:6></a> How the Lord must love desires like these!<a name=107:7></a> Do we want the Lord for His own sake?<a name=107:8></a> We needed Him for what He would do for us, for what He brought to us, as we were on the roadside half-dead, stripped.<a name=107:9></a> I needed Him on the night I confessed Him in the gospel, but do I need Him for His own sake?<a name=107:10></a> Do we value His presence, so that we ask Him if He will stay while we provide something to minister to His own heart?<a name=107:11></a>

		The next thing is that "Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarah".<a name=107:12></a> He is going to bring her into it.<a name=107:13></a> Love is never selfish.<a name=107:14></a> She is there in the tent: she does not have to be sent for, she is a keeper at home.<a name=107:15></a> Hers is to knead the bread, to get it ready.<a name=107:16></a> She can do it.<a name=107:17></a> She is not buying it ready made.<a name=107:18></a> She will make it, and these heavenly visitors will wait while it is made.<a name=107:19></a> It is to Abraham's credit that he brings Sarah in.<a name=107:20></a> He says, "Knead quickly three seahs of wheaten flour".<a name=107:21></a> I believe there is an answer in this to the fact that there were three visitors.<a name=107:22></a> Every fresh ray of light that reaches us is to have its effect, and future movements and actions are to be coloured by it.<a name=107:23></a> A fresh touch today from the Lord is intended to colour the rest of our spiritual experience and movements here.<a name=107:24></a> As we get the light, the

	<div class="paragraph">
		What is meant by philosophy and vain deceit?<a name=168:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We are in danger of having human wisdom.<a name=168:11></a> The use of a proverb, for example, sometimes introduces a worldly principle, a wrong element.<a name=168:12></a> The bases of philosophy were established in Greece.<a name=168:13></a> It is the introduction of human ethics, the establishment of an order of things to bring in certain ends.<a name=168:14></a> We need to turn our minds from that kind of wisdom.<a name=168:15></a> It is brought in with the idea of regulation and order to a certain end.<a name=168:16></a> It is a system of ethics to secure a certain end.<a name=168:17></a> The apostle says in effect, Do not touch it.<a name=168:18></a>

		Secondly, he warns them to refuse what had been set up as to holy days, feasts, and so on, things that had their place in a previous dispensation, but are now set aside.<a name=168:19></a> They have no place in the christian circle.<a name=168:20></a> "Having effaced the handwriting in ordinances".<a name=168:21></a> They were part of the Jewish system, divinely established, whereas philosophy is human.<a name=168:22></a> That is the second point.<a name=168:23></a>

		R.D.<a name=271:1></a> I simply suggested this scripture because I think James gives us a good start on spiritual lines practically, and I think it is important to have a good beginning and to maintain it.<a name=271:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		R.D.<a name=271:14></a> James puts you on the lines in which you can have the Lord's support, and if there is one thing desirable it is to have the support of the Lord.<a name=271:15></a> James tells you where the Lord will support you, and he also tells you where He cannot.<a name=271:16></a> He writes in view of the kingdom of heaven being presented, and the idea of the kingdom of heaven is that there is support from where Christ is for those who answer to the principles that are proper to the kingdom.<a name=271:17></a> So he prepares you for what is entirely spiritual.<a name=271:18></a> There is one very interesting thing in connection with James; he himself had known what it was to get onto entirely spiritual lines.<a name=271:19></a> I refer to the probability of his

		R.D.<a name=272:5></a> There is no recognition of the flesh at all, and moving on that line there is unlimited support from the Lord.<a name=272:6></a> One would be anxious to always have the support of the Lord, but He only supports what is of Himself, and He does not support what is not.<a name=272:7></a> The proposal that James has at the outset of the epistle is that we should be "perfect and complete, lacking in nothing".<a name=272:8></a> That is a very good proposal, is it not?<a name=272:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		R.D.<a name=272:13></a> Yes; but what James has in view is that the saints should be "perfect and complete, lacking in nothing".<a name=272:14></a> It is important that we should start right down at the rock bottom with James.<a name=272:15></a> Rightly taken up, this leads to the full enjoyment of the Ephesian position.<a name=272:16></a> James takes a soul up and immediately tells him what his conduct should be, the conduct that secures support from the Lord, that leads you into standing perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.<a name=272:17></a> God begat us that we should be a certain first-fruits of His creatures; and that is a very great place to have.<a name=272:18></a> James was in the assembly, and appreciated the immense favour of it.<a name=272:19></a> What a great thought the assembly is; and the only way to reach the participation of being first-fruits now for God, is by way of the kingdom of heaven.<a name=272:20></a>

		I want to say a word or two, beloved, as to the way the Lord would encourage an individual believer who had exercises as to His interests, and who longed to secure the glory; how He would encourage such an one in a day like the present.<a name=351:1></a> I believe that the end of that encouragement would be that the Lord would revive in the vicinity and surroundings of that believer, something to evidence the fact that He was supporting him.<a name=351:2></a> I think I may say that the first important feature in the recovery of the glory with any one is the consciousness, in his or her soul, of its departure.<a name=351:3></a> "The glory is departed from Israel", one of old said (<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#4:22">1 Samuel  4:22</a>).<a name=351:4></a> I read the passage in Ezekiel for that reason.<a name=351:5></a> The prophet Ezekiel, as you know, is the great servant of the glory.<a name=351:6></a> He has a special service in regard of Israel, and I believe a special service in regard of the assembly, and that service is to secure the return of the glory.<a name=351:7></a>

		The exercises in Isaiah are to secure the evangelical spirit of Jehovah in Israel.<a name=351:8></a> In other words, to break down the contracted, selfish, national spirit that marked them, about which there was no glory, and to put in its place an enlarged spirit of liberty and affection that would go out to every one.<a name=351:9></a> Now in order to work that out, the main objective of the prophet's ministry is to bring the people,

		by a series of very interesting exercises, to contemplate Christ as a Substitute - perhaps the most difficult thing to get any one to contemplate.<a name=352:1></a> Believers can contemplate Christ in almost every light rather than that light.<a name=352:2></a> I have no doubt that the series of woes which Isaiah brings forward, are to get souls into the consciousness of what the prophet started with in his ministry, that is what he said in the presence of the glory, "Woe unto me!<a name=352:3></a> for I am undone; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#6:5">Isaiah  6:5</a>).<a name=352:4></a> The series of woes I believe to be the way God will bring His ancient people to that utterance.<a name=352:5></a> When they come to that, they will want a substitute; they will look round for a living Man, a Person of whom of old it could be said, "He shall grow up before him as a tender sapling, and as a root out of dry ground" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#53:2">Isaiah  53:2</a>).<a name=352:6></a> They will look round for Christ, and I would feel inclined to say that I believe the gospel has had its proper effect on any believer when he has looked round for Christ.<a name=352:7></a> The first effect of the light of God entering a soul is to look round for relief.<a name=352:8></a> The pressure of guilt, the burden of guilt, makes a man look round for relief, but when he gets relief he looks round for Christ, and when he does so he finds Him, for the desire of all nations has come.<a name=352:9></a> That is the object of Isaiah.<a name=352:10></a>

		Ezekiel goes on to say, "And I looked, and behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the look of glowing brass, out of the midst of the fire".<a name=355:11></a> That is the prophet's description of the glory.<a name=355:12></a> It is very touching.<a name=355:13></a> He describes it as of glowing brass, coming out of the midst of a fire, that is, as I understand it, a peculiar brilliancy which has shone, and radiated, through everything that is suggestive of the scrutiny and judgment of God.<a name=355:14></a> I would say, beloved, that is what you will look like when you have come out of the trial of your faith.<a name=355:15></a> It is much more precious than gold.<a name=355:16></a> You will come out like glowing brass, as it comes out of the midst of a fire, the peculiar shining which is the product of the exercises that God has brought you through.<a name=355:17></a>
