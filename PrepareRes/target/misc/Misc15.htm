	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In taking up this subject, I assume that every one who belongs to the Lord Jesus is devoted to Him for service.<a name=1:1></a> I cannot conceive any other position.<a name=1:2></a> An appreciation of Christ can only produce that response in our hearts.<a name=1:3></a> The measure of our appreciation of what the Lord Jesus has done no doubt greatly comforts our hearts, and through grace there will be great enlargement in it with us all.<a name=1:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I assume that as believers in the Lord Jesus Christ we are definitely devoted to service, and I make an appeal at the outset to all here as to whether that is so.<a name=1:5></a> I do not presume to define what the service is.<a name=1:6></a> Probably that is a matter that lies between the Lord Jesus and your own souls; but that every one who belongs to Him is devoted for service, and that for ever, must go without saying; for the immensity of what Christ has done lays us under eternal obligation.<a name=1:7></a> Our lives, our abilities, all that we possess, must be at His feet for service.<a name=1:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On this occasion I want to consider the Lord in the capacity of Servant.<a name=1:9></a> Time is insufficient to regard the Lord in that light exhaustively on this occasion, but I want to indicate some thoughts with regard to the Lord Jesus in the capacity of God's Servant.<a name=1:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As taking up the subject in hand I am convinced that the Lord Jesus in His manhood would have

		great regard to Him whom He served.<a name=2:1></a> God, in the occasion of His allusion to Jesus as His Servant, outlines <i>who</i> He is, and <i>what</i> He is!<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord Jesus, as here typically, was occupied with His service, and spoke as Man in relation to God.<a name=2:3></a> He served in a greater light as Son, but He served in the conscious capacity of a Man in relation to God.<a name=2:4></a> He was, as we know and rejoice in, a blessed Man out of heaven, and of another order to the man who was formed out of the dust of the ground.<a name=2:5></a> But for all that, the Lord Jesus Christ occupied a place as Man in relation to God, and He ever served God, "God, Jehovah, he that created the heavens and stretched them out, he that spread forth the earth, and its productions".<a name=2:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There would be, as there was, a divine and positive issue to Christ's service.<a name=2:7></a> He stands out in His moral glory as greater than all who ever served.<a name=2:8></a> In creating the heavens, in stretching them out, in forming the earth, God had something in His mind in regard to man.<a name=2:9></a> In all our service, whatever form it takes, we should know what it is to serve as having that in view.<a name=2:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God says, "Behold my servant".<a name=2:11></a> Before the arrival of Jesus, God had had other servants.<a name=2:12></a> You remember He spoke of Moses (<a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#1:2">Joshua  1:2</a>); Christ is distinguished above them all by the word that God utters, "Behold my servant".<a name=2:13></a> The Lord Jesus Christ as here in that path of grace was in the secret of all that.<a name=2:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two dangers: one is to serve unintelligently, and the other is not to serve at all.<a name=3:3></a> There should be a sense in our hearts that God has definitely taken us up for service.<a name=3:4></a> It was so with Christ.<a name=3:5></a> What must it have been for Him when He said, "I have laboured in vain, and spent my strength for nought" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#49:4">Isaiah  49:4</a>).<a name=3:6></a> For all that, there abode in His heart the secret that He was God's Servant.<a name=3:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It should be to us, as it was to Him, a never-failing resource to have that thought in our hearts.<a name=3:8></a> The Lord Jesus had it, He never lost it.<a name=3:9></a> At the cross He did not abandon it, but He held it.<a name=3:10></a> Though forsaken, He was God's Servant.<a name=3:11></a> I think of the apostle Paul; you will remember that when all in Asia turned away (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1:15">2 Timothy  1:15</a>), he knew he was God's servant.<a name=3:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Mine elect": He was the one Person who supremely could take up things for God.<a name=3:13></a> What must that have been to His heart?<a name=3:14></a> He was ever standing, ready to serve.<a name=3:15></a> There was Michael, the archangel (<a href="../bible/Jude.htm#9">Jude  9</a>), there was Gabriel, who stood in the presence of God (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:19">Luke  1:19</a>), there were myriads of angels ready to serve -- but of none of them was it ever said, "Mine elect".<a name=3:16></a> That was the unique place occupied by the Lord.<a name=3:17></a> What it was to His heart, who can tell?<a name=3:18></a> In the presence of the reproach, shame and scorn, God said, "in whom my soul delighteth".<a name=3:19></a> My own impression is that the spirit of the unique, spiritual energy in which Jesus served, was the outcome of the place He knew He had as the Object of the

	<div class="paragraph">
		delight of God.<a name=4:1></a> God alluded to the emotions that were His; He spoke of His soul finding delight.<a name=4:2></a> There was a Man here devoted to service.<a name=4:3></a> In Him God found delight.<a name=4:4></a> Though this was unique to Christ, God would have delight in us.<a name=4:5></a> There is a holy joy; it may be ours.<a name=4:6></a> We may be strangers to it as yet, but there is that place.<a name=4:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God says, "I will put my Spirit upon him".<a name=4:8></a> He was a Man in His service.<a name=4:9></a> He had served in the place of creatorial power, of divine greatness; but He came to this earth in manhood, and God put His Spirit upon Him.<a name=4:10></a> He stood up in the synagogue with the conscious dignity and grace of a Man who was anointed with the Spirit of God.<a name=4:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There should be with us not only the indwelling Spirit, but there should be the sense of having God's Spirit upon us, as here for power.<a name=4:12></a> The apostle Peter takes up the truth of the anointing of Christ (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10">Acts  10</a>).<a name=4:13></a> We should have the anointing.<a name=4:14></a> We should know what it is.<a name=4:15></a> Terms are not sufficient.<a name=4:16></a> Christ knew it in power.<a name=4:17></a> We need have no recourse to anything after the flesh.<a name=4:18></a> What shall we need if we have the divine consciousness that the Spirit of God is upon us?<a name=4:19></a> The Lord was here in the knowledge of that, and that sustained Him.<a name=4:20></a> God delights to allude to Him.<a name=4:21></a> It afforded Him infinite delight.<a name=4:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God says, "He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street".<a name=4:23></a> Christ's pathway on earth was not one of self-assertion.<a name=4:24></a> In His history here it certainly was not necessary that He should assert Himself, for God was with Him.<a name=4:25></a> He was here

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is never a moment in our history when we need to make use of self-assertion.<a name=5:3></a> If resorted to, God will not support it.<a name=5:4></a> "A bruised reed" -- "smoking flax".<a name=5:5></a> The character of Christ in this world, as the Servant of Jehovah, was that He would ever have regard to what was weak.<a name=5:6></a> The disposition in the world is to despise it.<a name=5:7></a> The movement of Christ was to regard it.<a name=5:8></a> The Lord was ready for the slightest evidence of life and energy God-ward; and He had power and grace to discern it.<a name=5:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am under a strong impression that in the times in which we live our service might be in relation to what is weak -- the "smoking flax".<a name=5:10></a> This is a distinguishing feature of the Lord's service.<a name=5:11></a> Is it a distinguishing feature of ours?<a name=5:12></a> It should be.<a name=5:13></a> We should be prepared to serve in relation to what is weak.<a name=5:14></a> Do we know any one in our acquaintance, in our office, in our lives, that is marked by weakness, that which is contemptible in the eyes of the world?<a name=5:15></a> That would be the very direction in which the Lord would turn.<a name=5:16></a> We should turn in that direction.<a name=5:17></a> Following the flesh would give us to turn to what is great.<a name=5:18></a> The Lord turned to that which the world would only despise.<a name=5:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		No mind of man will ever be able to fully estimate the value of the Lord's service.<a name=5:20></a> This is the direction of it, and He would have us move in the same direction, and not move in relation to what is great.<a name=5:21></a> The Lord was characterised by moving in

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The cross is the most contemptible thing in the world's history.<a name=6:2></a> On the cross, and on the crucified Man, the world looked with hatred and scorn.<a name=6:3></a> The result of the cross will be a period of peace for a thousand years, then new heavens and a new earth, and Christ has wrought it all, the blessed Man who moved in relation to what was weak.<a name=6:4></a> Of Him God can say, "he shall bring forth judgment".<a name=6:5></a> Think of God being able to respond in the heavens, having committed everything into the hands of a Man!<a name=6:6></a> Adam had broken down in his position -- he had only to tend a garden -- but here was a man before the whole universe, and of Him God says, "He shall not fail" (verse 4, A.<a name=6:7></a>V.<a name=6:8></a>).<a name=6:9></a> Believe me, all the great powers of the world who have rejected Christ will come to His footstool.<a name=6:10></a> This is God's answer to the service of Christ.<a name=6:11></a> Truth is going to be established in this universe by that blessed, lowly Servant of God.<a name=6:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have often thought of what it would be with regard to the little bit of service God has committed to me.<a name=6:13></a> How many of us have given up?<a name=6:14></a> You young people, go to see the sick and the dying, and call at the houses sometimes.<a name=6:15></a> You might find someone craving for the Saviour.<a name=6:16></a> "He shall not fail".<a name=6:17></a> God can say, I can leave that thing in her hands -- she will never leave that soul.<a name=6:18></a> One soul brought into the light and knowledge of the glory of God!<a name=6:19></a> If the Lord had failed, what would have happened to us?<a name=6:20></a> We must have gone down to an eternity of woe; but He never

		I assure you that I long with a longing that I cannot describe to look into the face of the One who has never failed.<a name=7:2></a> I want to see Him -- I am sure you do too.<a name=7:3></a> "He shall not fail".<a name=7:4></a> What a delight for the heart of God!<a name=7:5></a> the magnitude of the moral glory of such a servant of Christ!<a name=7:6></a> God addresses Himself to Christ -- this peculiarly personal address to Christ must have delighted His heart!<a name=7:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Do you know what it is to wait in the presence of the Lord?<a name=7:8></a> You cannot go and do what some one else has done, you must get your line of service direct from God Himself.<a name=7:9></a> He gave to "each one his work" (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#13:34">Mark  13:34</a>).<a name=7:10></a> This is an authoritative statement.<a name=7:11></a> The movement is one of righteousness.<a name=7:12></a> If God made this statement to Christ ("I, Jehovah, have called thee in righteousness"), think of the world calling His service into question!<a name=7:13></a> God will justify the one who moves in righteousness; there are those who are serving today.<a name=7:14></a> Your own soul will be moved by thinking that the Lord Jesus is justifying you.<a name=7:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We are going to follow in the path of the Lord Jesus as Servant here.<a name=7:16></a> It is a difficult path.<a name=7:17></a> The secret of it in the heart is that of being definitely taken up by God Himself.<a name=7:18></a> "I … have called thee … and will take hold of thy hand".<a name=7:19></a> Think of a servant here on the earth with God holding his hand!<a name=7:20></a> That is the idea conveyed to the Lord, "I … will take hold of thy hand".<a name=7:21></a> It is a wonderful thing to serve in the sense that, in our poor feeble measure, we may know the blessedness of this, "I … will take hold of thy

		"I will … give thee for a covenant of the people".<a name=8:10></a> The idea there was that Christ was to be given to be the impression of divine thoughts set out morally in a Man.<a name=8:11></a> In other words, that that blessed Man was going to be morally like God.<a name=8:12></a> I understand that is what we are to be: morally like God -- the expression in our lives of power Godward.<a name=8:13></a> There is a grandeur about them which stands in elevation above anything that the world can give.<a name=8:14></a> I would like to manifest, in my bearing as a man, a spirit of forgiveness and grace, so that it might be said, That is on the line of what God is.<a name=8:15></a> This was characteristic of Christ.<a name=8:16></a> Men saw the grace of God in Him.<a name=8:17></a> "To open the blind eyes".<a name=8:18></a> How lovely to be capacitated to open people's eyes!<a name=8:19></a> Are we wasting our time here?<a name=8:20></a> We should be in service -- devoted to service -- with this blessed object in view.<a name=8:21></a> What about the man who sits next to you in the office?<a name=8:22></a> He does not understand, you say.<a name=8:23></a> Think of labouring in prayer for him.<a name=8:24></a>

		Hosea was a very feeling prophet, a man with God, and he goes over the history of some of God's dealings with His people.<a name=9:15></a> He says, "When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son".<a name=9:16></a> We see failure with Ephraim, but we also

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God speaks very feelingly of Ephraim: "I it was that taught Ephraim to walk".<a name=10:3></a> Think of the wonderful feelings of God Himself, that He would come near to His people in their circumstances!<a name=10:4></a> It says, "He took them upon his arms".<a name=10:5></a> The fathers and mothers here would understand what it is to teach a child to walk.<a name=10:6></a> Think of God, in His patient grace, taking His own along the way; if they were too tired to walk, He would carry them: "He took them upon his arms"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But God has to speak at times very straightly about Ephraim.<a name=10:7></a> Earlier in this prophecy it says, "Ephraim is become like a silly dove" (chapter 7: 11), yet God was thinking about him.<a name=10:8></a> God thinks, too, about you and me in all our difficulties and problems that we may have to face, but He wants to secure an answer from us for Himself.<a name=10:9></a> Think of the affections that God has for His own, and those affections, may we say, are answered to in recovery.<a name=10:10></a> We need to pray for recovery for one another, and pray for recovery too for those who have gone astray, that God may be pleased to come in in blessing.<a name=10:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		God said earlier, "Ephraim is joined to idols: leave him alone" (chapter 4: 17), and in chapter 14 the prophet says, "O Israel, return unto Jehovah thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity.<a name=11:4></a> Take with you words and turn to Jehovah; say unto him, Forgive all iniquity, and receive us graciously".<a name=11:5></a> Think of God, through the prophet, putting the very words that He wants in Israel's mouth, in order to be able to respond to Him!<a name=11:6></a> "Forgive all iniquity, and receive us graciously; so will we render the calves of our lips".<a name=11:7></a> Think of the answer that God is looking for: "Thou art our God; because in thee the fatherless findeth mercy" (verse 3).<a name=11:8></a> God says, "I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely" (verse 4).<a name=11:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Think of God in this attitude of grace and mercy, desirous of being able to say of Israel, "I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely".<a name=11:10></a> And then Ephraim will be able to say, "What have I to do any more with idols?<a name=11:11></a>" as having been brought round, though once taken up in idolatry.<a name=11:12></a> It is wonderful when we come to that in soul history, when God becomes the Object of the heart, and Christ Himself becomes supreme in our affections.<a name=11:13></a> So it says here, "Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more

		In <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#3">Genesis  3</a>, you find that man sins, and then God sets him to work in another way as part of His governmental ways with him.<a name=18:9></a> It says in verse 19, "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, until thou return to the ground: for out of it wast thou taken.<a name=18:10></a> For dust thou art; and unto dust shalt thou return".<a name=18:11></a> That is, God introduced hard labour.<a name=18:12></a> You might say that hard labour is part of His governmental ways with man as a result of his sin, and that remains to this day.<a name=18:13></a>

		the same time, certain governmental consequences on the woman, and they remain until this day; but man has to work in the sweat of his brow, and that is part of God's governmental ways with man.<a name=19:1></a> Thus it is important that we should understand that it is for every one of us to submit ourselves to it, in lowliness and subjection.<a name=19:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As some of us were saying yesterday, God's ways in government always have in mind the furtherance of His ways in blessing.<a name=19:3></a> He has taken us up for blessing before the foundation of the world, and His ways with us, what He orders for us, have in mind the further promotion of the blessing which He has taken us up for, according to His purpose.<a name=19:4></a> Hence, in this passage in Thessalonians, the apostle is commending the brethren, saying that he had no need to write to them as to brotherly love, "for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.<a name=19:5></a> For also ye do this towards all the brethren in the whole of Macedonia: but we exhort you, brethren, to abound still more, and to seek earnestly to be quiet, and mind your own affairs, and work with your own hands, even as we charged you, that ye may walk reputably towards those without, and may have need of no one".<a name=19:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is a remarkable exhortation from the Lord by the apostle Paul to every one of us -- to work with our own hands, so that we may be walking with a good reputation among those without, that there should be no discredit brought on the testimony, and we should have need of no one -- not to be dependent

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this is very practicable, and as you read Scripture, especially the epistles, you find that Christianity is not intended to alter the state of things in the world.<a name=20:3></a> The world has, of course, greatly benefited by its influence, but God does not intend to set aside the inequalities that exist among men; for some are servants and some employers: but God does not upset that, He rather brings in the power to adorn the doctrine <i>as</i> a servant, and the power to adorn the doctrine <i>as</i> an employer.<a name=20:4></a> The epistles are full of this.<a name=20:5></a> We shall find that <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#6">Ephesians  6</a>, <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3">Colossians  3</a>and 4, 1 Peter, <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#6">1 Timothy  6</a>, this epistle (1), and 2 Thessalonians, all touch on this question.<a name=20:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These practical questions of our working and how we are to conduct ourselves if we are servants, and how we are to conduct ourselves if we are masters, are practical matters which the Spirit of God takes up, and they are part of our discipline.<a name=20:7></a> Discipline belongs to us all as children, and as sons.<a name=20:8></a> <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12">Hebrews  12</a>shows that every one of us comes in for discipline <i>because</i> we are sons.<a name=20:9></a> "Ye endure for chastening, God conducts himself towards you as towards sons; for who is the son that the father chastens not?<a name=20:10></a> But if ye are without chastening, of which all have been made partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.<a name=20:11></a> Moreover we have had the fathers of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now before I pass on, I urge the brethren to bear in mind that there are those two kinds of work that God has ordained for man.<a name=21:6></a> I hope to speak in a moment of the more exalted kind of work, but first, there is the kind of work that comes upon us in God's governmental ways.<a name=21:7></a> The women have their governmental consequences, and of course, the women have to work too, they work in the house.<a name=21:8></a> But the men particularly have to recognise that God's government requires that they work, and work hard and continuously, until the time that they come to die, if they have the ability to do so.<a name=21:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There is also the more privileged and exalted kind of work.<a name=21:10></a> God placed the man in the garden to till it, and to guard it.<a name=21:11></a> Tilling would involve work.<a name=21:12></a> If, as I have no doubt, the garden of Eden is rightly regarded as a type of the assembly at the present time, as that which is intended peculiarly to afford

		In seeking to answer the inquiry, 'What is a Christian?<a name=28:2></a>' it is necessary to emphasise this most important characteristic -- the serving spirit.<a name=28:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The typical Christian illustrative of this feature is Paul -- once Saul of Tarsus -- who was perhaps the most distinguished servant of the Lord.<a name=28:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The true features shone out in Paul in a remarkable manner when he stood before king Agrippa, by whom he was examined as a Christian rather than as an apostle -- though he was that, of course.<a name=28:5></a> He was brought before the king as a prisoner, to answer charges founded on his testimony to Christ and upon Christianity as expressed in him.<a name=28:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Agrippa was sitting on the judgment throne to ascertain whether Paul was worthy of death, but after Paul had spoken to him words of truth and soberness, living words of power, and told how the Lord had met him in the way, converted and trans- formed him, a moment arrived when Agrippa came under the power of his words and said, "In a little thou persuadest me to become a Christian" (verse 28).<a name=28:7></a> He saw that there was something in Christianity which he had never known of before.<a name=28:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Think of Paul, in the dignity of a servant of God, standing before the king and saying, "I would to God … that not only thou, but all who have heard me this day, should become such as <i>I</i> also am,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=29>[Page 29]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		except these bonds".<a name=29:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul wanted them all to be Christians.<a name=29:2></a> He would have them all to know the joy that was his; to be servants of the same Master.<a name=29:3></a> It is clear from this that a Christian normally is a <i>servant</i>, conscious of the dignity of his service.<a name=29:4></a> Paul stood before Agrippa in the consciousness that he, in the dignity which God had given him -- not in his own, for that would have been human pride -- he, the prisoner, was superior to king Agrippa himself; he was fully conscious of being a servant of God, and he desired that every one who heard him might be as he was -- a Christian.<a name=29:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Can we each be regarded as a Christian in this sense, conscious of the dignity of serving God?<a name=29:6></a> It is possible that there are those who have believed in Christ, but who, if challenged, would have to admit that they are not conscious of any service which they have in hand for the Lord.<a name=29:7></a> That is a very serious position, because before He went away, the Lord spoke of "a man gone out of the country, having … given … to each one his work" (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#13:34">Mark  13:34</a>), clearly indicating that He has in mind to entrust a service to each one of us.<a name=29:8></a> If we do not know what that service is, it is not because there is nothing for us to do, but because we have not found out from the Lord Himself what He would entrust to us.<a name=29:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It might be very insignificant work, or even uncongenial; it might be the very task which we would not have chosen; but if it is His work it is worth doing, and doing well.<a name=29:10></a> However small certain features of the service may be, there is a dignity attaching to
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=30>[Page 30]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the Lord's service that we should cherish in our souls at all times, as ready to do His bidding because of the glory of Him who has entrusted the task to us.<a name=30:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We would encourage the youngest believer to ask the Lord Jesus what He would entrust to him, and then to raise the question, 'Am I trustworthy, Lord?<a name=30:2></a>' Because the Lord will use trustworthy servants.<a name=30:3></a> You would not give an important charge into the hands of an untrustworthy person, and, the more dignified the service, the more important it is that the servant should be trustworthy.<a name=30:4></a> Paul was such a servant, worthy to stand before kings and testify of Christ.<a name=30:5></a> Did you observe that he used the words, "such as <i>I</i> also <i>am</i>"?<a name=30:6></a> A Christian is a person who <i>is</i> -- not only who speaks.<a name=30:7></a> So Paul, the servant of God, could stand before the king in all the dignity of what he <i>was</i>.<a name=30:8></a> A Christian is a truly wonderful person: he is not only one who has trusted in Christ, but one in whom God has wrought; he is both a disciple and a servant.<a name=30:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a peculiar dignity about one who serves Christ.<a name=30:10></a> He stoops down to the level of those in sorrow, for Christ's sake; he weeps with those who weep; his hands minister to the saints.<a name=30:11></a> It is not a matter of eloquent speaking, or of high position, but of the spirit of Jesus reproduced in those who have come under His influence and delight in the service of Christ.<a name=30:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is of great interest to find that Paul was able to speak of his child in the faith, Timothy, as being characterised by this spirit, for he refers to him as

		The variety of christian service is of deep importance: the service of God in the sanctuary; the interests of the assembly; the work of the gospel; the visiting of the sick; the personal life of good works, are all embraced in the word 'service'.<a name=31:2></a> It would be well if every one who has never yet done so, inquired like Saul of Tarsus, when he first heard the Lord's voice, "What shall I do, Lord?<a name=31:3></a>" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#22:10">Acts  22:10</a>).<a name=31:4></a> Then, having received the Lord's answer, we should be stimulated by the stirring exhortation: "So then … be firm, immovable, abounding always in the work of the Lord, knowing that your toil is not in vain in the Lord" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:58">1 Corinthians  15:58</a>).<a name=31:5></a>

		I desire to say a word about divine setting and divine choice.<a name=43:5></a> In Revelation, the Lord Jesus says, "I have set before thee an opened door"; in Corinthians, "God has set the members … in the body, according as it has pleased him"; and in Ephesians, the Father has chosen us in Christ and marked us out for sonship beforehand through Jesus Christ to Himself.<a name=43:6></a> I believe the Lord would make an appeal to each one of us that we might realise how important saints are for the fulfilment of the plans of divine love.<a name=43:7></a> Each one has a part to fill out that no one else can possibly do.<a name=43:8></a> I believe the more we realise it, the more it will help us to accept responsibility, and to be more vitally in the testimony of our Lord at the present time.<a name=43:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord says further of the overcomer, "I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God".<a name=46:11></a> He is desirous of giving us a knowledge of His blessed God.<a name=46:12></a> Think of that message on the resurrection morn, "go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#20:17">John  20:17</a>).<a name=46:13></a> Do you know God?<a name=46:14></a> Are you in the enjoyment of His love?<a name=46:15></a> That is what Christ wants each one to have.<a name=46:16></a>

		Now the passage in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>speaks about the members of the body of Christ and the power of one Spirit.<a name=48:3></a> "<i>We</i> have all been baptised into one body".<a name=48:4></a> Baptism by water means that you are submerged, in view of being separated from the world; but baptism by the Spirit means that you are merged with your brethren, you are not independent.<a name=48:5></a> You cannot say, 'I can do without that member', for you need them all; or 'They are a little awkward sometimes'.<a name=48:6></a> Maybe, but that is our opportunity to show the Spirit of Christ, which is a test to us, but something can be formed in our souls as a result.<a name=48:7></a> The One who lives for us, will help us work out the truth of the body in detailed consideration and feelings for one another, reflecting something of the priestly feelings of Christ towards you and me as members of His body.<a name=48:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The point I want to come to is this, "But now God has set the members, each one of them in the body, according as it has pleased him".<a name=48:9></a> God has set you and me where we are, as it has pleased Him, not haphazardly, it is sovereignly ordered of God.<a name=48:10></a> It is one thing to have the truth of the body, another thing to work it out, but it works as each individual member realises that he or she is a member "in particular".<a name=48:11></a> There is no other member exactly the same as you.<a name=48:12></a> Who is going to be you if you are not yourself?<a name=48:13></a> You have to be yourself, that is, according to the work of God in you, and you have a responsibility to

		Then Paul adds, "Now <i>ye</i> are Christ's body, and members in particular".<a name=49:2></a> He is trying to bring home to these Corinthian saints, who were following men, that Christ is to be supreme, and that they were to function as they should in the body of Christ.<a name=49:3></a> I should like to emphasise the expression, "<i>ye</i> are … members in particular".<a name=49:4></a> You say, I am a nobody.<a name=49:5></a> That may be perfectly true, for so we all would be but for Christ's grace.<a name=49:6></a> But on the other hand, according to divine sovereignty you are a member "in particular", and you are set in that place where you live for some particular reason, and that is to reflect Christ.<a name=49:7></a> As you reflect Christ, it will affect the next member, and one locality affects another locality, and things work out in mutuality, but it is the fruit of accepting responsibility.<a name=49:8></a> I cannot leave my service for someone else to do.<a name=49:9></a> You cannot say to another member, I do not have any need of you.<a name=49:10></a> We need one another, and we do so increasingly, and, thank God, the body is working at the present time.<a name=49:11></a> May it continue to do so, and may there be an increase in it.<a name=49:12></a>

		FORMATION OF THE FAMILY OF GOD

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are many peculiarities about this gospel that might be spoken of with profit, but I want now to confine myself mainly to that feature of it that suggests the formation of the family of God.<a name=51:8></a> That we, as believers in Christ, have part in the divine family, is one of the most precious facts involved in our position here.<a name=51:9></a> I am not speaking of the place we shall have in the future, for then we shall be one family among other families, as we read in Ephesians.<a name=51:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=52>[Page 52]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Speaking of the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ the apostle says, "of whom every family in the heavens and on earth is named".<a name=52:1></a> Thus we learn that there shall be many families and that we shall have our place as a family amongst others.<a name=52:2></a> I do not intend to speak of that, but of the place that we have now whilst here on earth, as John says, Jesus, "having loved his own who were in the world, loved them to the end".<a name=52:3></a> This Gospel takes account of the saints as here in the world as to our outward position, and it shows how we have this place with God as a family, and that the Lord Jesus is, so to say, Head.<a name=52:4></a> He is our Head.<a name=52:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I read the passage in chapter 11, in order to show how He, when here, could love a family, not exactly that which was His own, or of which He was Head, but that He could love and did love a family, for although Martha's, Mary's and Lazarus' parents had evidently passed away, the family affections remained; not parental affections or filial affections, but the affections that belong properly to brothers and sisters.<a name=52:6></a> The circle at Bethany was evidently a parentless one: a family without parents.<a name=52:7></a> No greater calamity can befall a family than that it should be deprived of the parents, and so this family at Bethany afforded an opportunity to Christ to show His affection, and how He could make up for the loss that existed.<a name=52:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Luke records that in the house at Emmaus the Lord took the place of Head; in the margin of the better translation you have the "House father" ['…

	<div class="page-number">

	<div class="paragraph">
		He took the house-father's place, and blessed and gave it to them' -- footnote <i>f</i>, <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:30">Luke  24:30</a>].<a name=53:1></a> He took that place.<a name=53:2></a> He could very readily have disclosed Himself to the two as they journeyed on the way.<a name=53:3></a> He could have told them, but He did not, He had other thoughts.<a name=53:4></a> He caused their heart to burn on the way, but He waited till the meal was set in order that He should have the opportunity of disclosing Himself in this peculiar function, that is, the function of Head.<a name=53:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I believe that at the present time that is where Christians are most defective.<a name=53:6></a> We are most defective, I believe, in the apprehension of Christ as Head, so He would seize every opportunity to bring Himself before us in that light, for a headless family is obviously not the divine thought.<a name=53:7></a> The divine thought is that families should have heads, all working up to the great divine idea that Christ should be Head, and that is the lesson to be read in every household.<a name=53:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Adam is said to be "the figure of him to come" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:14">Romans  5:14</a>), and Adam was head, but he made a very poor showing, I need not say, in the exercise of his function, and Eve fell in the non-recognition of it.<a name=53:9></a> Had she observed the place that God had given to her husband in regard to herself, she would have replied to Satan, 'Adam is my head, I am to get my instructions from him'.<a name=53:10></a> But instead of this she listened to the tempter, and so, beloved brethren, Christians generally are exposed to the tempter because of the non-recognition and non-understanding of the headship of Christ.<a name=53:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=54>[Page 54]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now you will recall how <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#3">Genesis  3</a>and 4 are both marked by the disaster that flowed from Eve's disregard of the divine function placed in Adam; she figures in chapter 4, she names the children, and it is one disaster after another: a man, the progeny departing farther and farther away from God, until at the end Seth has a child born to him, and he called his name Enosh; that is, he comes to recognise that the offspring is of a poor, failing, dying creature: he accepts the judgment, and so it says, "Then people began to call on the name of Jehovah" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#4:26">Genesis  4:26</a>).<a name=54:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is recovery there: recovery brings back to the thought of headship and so in the next chapter Adam and Eve are formally taken account of; God "called their name Adam" (chapter 5: 2).<a name=54:2></a> God graciously takes into account recovery, and recovery to His original thought.<a name=54:3></a> He had never forgotten the principle of headship and He called their name Adam and so, in the line of Seth, from the one who is recovered to headship, we have the line of life, and dear brethren, John is the life-line.<a name=54:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#5">Genesis  5</a>the life-line is seen; in it all die except one [Enoch], and the exception, beloved brethren, establishes the line of life.<a name=54:5></a> One man in that chapter is pleasing to God, and mark you, the pleasure came in when he began to have a family; he begat a son; he became a parent, and from that moment he walked with God for 300 years.<a name=54:6></a> Depend upon it, walking with God, as he was a head of his family, he brought the influence of God into his household, and it was said of him, "he was not, for God took him"

		<a name=55>[Page 55]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(chapter 5: 24); God took him!<a name=55:1></a> It says in Hebrews, "for before his translation he has the testimony that he had pleased God" (chapter 11: 5), he walked with God.<a name=55:2></a> It does not simply say that God walked with him, not but that God did help him in regard to his affairs, but Enoch walked with God.<a name=55:3></a> That is the point for the present time.<a name=55:4></a> It fits in with John.<a name=55:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think that <a href="../bible/John.htm#5">John  5</a>places before us the opposite of what the apostle intends to present to us in that regard; that is, the pool of Bethesda.<a name=55:6></a> The pool is a stagnant water which is the opposite to what John would present to us.<a name=55:7></a> You have meetings that are only moved as an angel comes, so to say, and such a meeting as that is not in life.<a name=55:8></a> John would bring about life.<a name=55:9></a> "These are written that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life in his name" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#20:31">John  20:31</a>).<a name=55:10></a> A meeting of Christians in the light and good of John's ministry is not like the pool of Bethesda.<a name=55:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The principle of the pool of Bethesda was that an angel came down at a period and it required some power to get the benefit; the poor man was moved, but he had no power, no energy, hence the pool of Bethesda is not the principle of John.<a name=55:12></a> The principle of John is rather running water, living water.<a name=55:13></a> He brings in living water in chapter 4, it becomes in the believer a fountain; that is, it moves of itself, it is the Holy Spirit.<a name=55:14></a> Do not wait for external influences; there are such and of the best kind, but the principle of John is what is internal: he presents to us the truth of the Holy Spirit as a self-acting power in the heart.<a name=55:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=56>[Page 56]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us learn to wait, in the exercises of our soul, for the movement of the Holy Spirit; and I ask you, Are you ever conscious of the movements of the Holy Spirit?<a name=56:1></a> Jesus says, "the water which I shall give him shall become in him a fountain of water, springing up into eternal life" (chapter 4: 14).<a name=56:2></a> Do we realise that the Holy Spirit is verily in us?<a name=56:3></a> If we do not, let us wait before God about it.<a name=56:4></a> As the apostle says, prove your own selves, see if Christ is in you (cf.<a name=56:5></a> <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#13:5">2 Corinthians  13:5</a>).<a name=56:6></a> It is well to do that; that one should prove in one's own soul the reality and the presence of this self-acting power, the "fountain of water", the power of living water springing up into eternal life, and then, as you have it in chapter 7, there are rivers flowing out for the benefit of others (verse 38).<a name=56:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These are suggestions as to what John presents to us; as I was remarking, John speaks of movement.<a name=56:8></a> The spring is the Holy Spirit.<a name=56:9></a> You are to move, that is the fundamental principle of Christianity, viewed as a living order of things down here, and I again repeat that every one of us should find out, in his own soul, whether he has this self-acting Power, and if you have not realised it, I would seek to urge you to turn to God about it.<a name=56:10></a> It should be acting in you, that is the divine thought.<a name=56:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have thought of Caleb's daughter; she asks her father to give her springs of water, and he gave her the upper springs and the nether springs, (<a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#15:13">Joshua  15:13</a> - 19) and I would especially commend to you the nether springs, the Spirit of God in the Christian acting of Himself in your affections so that they
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=57>[Page 57]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		might spring up, and move towards God.<a name=57:1></a> In John chapter 4 they spring up, in chapter 7, they flow out.<a name=57:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Holy Spirit gathers the affections of the believer and fixes them on Christ in heaven, but then, as I was remarking, you have to move, I have to move.<a name=57:3></a> You find in this gospel, as the Lord comes into touch with souls, and as they come into touch with Him, each one is moved.<a name=57:4></a> Now to give you a well-known passage in chapter 1, John stood.<a name=57:5></a> It was on the morrow, he had been working, but the Lord comes to him, and he says, "he it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit" (verse 33).<a name=57:6></a> Now John stands, as if to say, 'The One who baptises with the Holy Spirit is on the scene, my work is done', and now he stands and looks at Jesus as He walked.<a name=57:7></a> What movement!<a name=57:8></a> What a walk that was!<a name=57:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Enoch walked with God, but here is the walk of the Lamb.<a name=57:10></a> Think of the intelligence, of the affection, of the purpose and devotedness, think of all that entered into those holy steps of Christ, the Lamb of God.<a name=57:11></a> John saw that: the two that stood by apparently did not see it, but they heard him, they heard what John had to say.<a name=57:12></a> How important it is to listen.<a name=57:13></a> And they followed Jesus.<a name=57:14></a> They heard John speak, and they followed Jesus; there was movement after Christ.<a name=57:15></a> The Lord says, as if to test what you have in your heart, in your movements, "What seek ye?<a name=57:16></a>" They say, "Rabbi (which, being interpreted, signifies Teacher), where abidest thou?<a name=57:17></a>" and He answers, "Come and see" (chapter 1: 38, 39).<a name=57:18></a> The principle is movement throughout, it is not a fixed state of things

		Nicodemus comes to Jesus by night and says to Him, "Rabbi, we know that thou art come a teacher from God" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:2">John  3:2</a>).<a name=75:2></a> He recognises Jesus come from God, and so does the woman, as I have remarked, as the Lord spoke to her, she "left her waterpot and went away into the city" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#4:28">John  4:28</a>), and the reason why she left her waterpot is remarkable instruction.<a name=75:3></a> We might say she might conveniently fill it and take it back with her.<a name=75:4></a> There is a spiritual significance: she acts in accord with the light the Lord had presented to her.<a name=75:5></a> She went back to the city and says to the men "Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done: is not he the Christ?<a name=75:6></a>" (verse ).<a name=75:7></a> Again there is movement: she moved and urged them to move and they moved.<a name=75:8></a> It says they came to the Lord and they said, Now we believe ourselves.<a name=75:9></a> Throughout you have this principle of movement, not the energy of the flesh, but the movement that is the result of the work of God by the Holy Spirit in the souls of His people.<a name=75:10></a>

		Jesus delights in a family like that.<a name=76:7></a> He never takes it as His family, it is always yours, and so in the circle at Bethany, He loves the household.<a name=76:8></a> You may ask, Why do you say so?<a name=76:9></a> Because it says He loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.<a name=76:10></a> It does not say He loved Mary, Martha, and Lazarus: He loved Martha, she was the owner of the house.<a name=76:11></a> I see in that the Lord graciously recognising her as the parents were not there.<a name=76:12></a> Now the Lord loved her, and her sister, and Lazarus.<a name=76:13></a> He can love a household.<a name=76:14></a>

		But then it is all to lead us over to the side of His household, that we might have part in that, and so in chapter 11, Caiaphas being high priest that year prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation, and then John the evangelist adds, and not for that nation only: He had in mind the family of God, that the

	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to call particular attention to the place that part of the truth holds in chapter 11.<a name=77:2></a> The evangelist adds immediately, "and not for that nation only, but that he should also gather together into one the children of God who were scattered abroad".<a name=77:3></a> Let us beware of national feelings; "not for that nation only".<a name=77:4></a> The principle of Christianity is that the children of God everywhere should be gathered.<a name=77:5></a> The house of God is a universal thought, not a national or international one, it is universal, it embraces all the children of God, and the Lord did not only die for that nation, but that He might gather together into one; it is a remarkable expression, "the children of God who were scattered abroad".<a name=77:6></a>

		In chapter 13, the Lord, as I apprehend it, is acting as the Head of His family, having loved His own.<a name=77:7></a> Beautiful thought!<a name=77:8></a> Could anything in a way express His care more than that for "his own".<a name=77:9></a> You have an expression in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20:28">Acts  20:28</a>, very similar in regard to God's affection for Christ; "the blood of his own", without saying who "his own" is.<a name=77:10></a> Jesus loved His own.<a name=77:11></a> Think of being amongst those whom He so regards!<a name=77:12></a> And then it adds, "having loved his own who were in the world", for He takes account of us in that position, He "loved them to the end".<a name=77:13></a> I am convinced that the Lord at the present time, which is the end, as one may say, is bringing about family affections, and I believe the Supper, with all that is contingent upon it, is the centre of those affections.<a name=77:14></a>

		Do you understand there are mutual obligations in the household circle, and that no one is immune from them?<a name=78:10></a> These obligations rest on every member of the household, "one another's feet".<a name=78:11></a> He addresses them later by His parental expression of children, and it is an expression on the part of the Lord that is taken little notice of.<a name=78:12></a> But it is only one who is in the position of a parent literally, or in a moral sense, who can employ such an expression, and so He says here in chapter 13: 33, "Children, yet a little while I am with you.<a name=78:13></a> Ye shall seek me … Where I go ye cannot come, I say to you also now".<a name=78:14></a> This intimates clearly that He was to be elsewhere and they were to

		I am not ignoring what is said in chapter 14, that He would come to them, but this passage intimates plainly that they should be in circumstances in which He should not be with them, "as I said to the Jews, Where I go ye cannot come, I say to you also now".<a name=79:2></a> Now what?<a name=79:3></a> "A new commandment I give to you, that ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another".<a name=79:4></a> That is how it reads.<a name=79:5></a> His commandment takes the place of Himself.<a name=79:6></a> Do you understand?<a name=79:7></a> How the commandment tests us!<a name=79:8></a> We are here, and He is there, but the commandment is here, and it is a new one.<a name=79:9></a> In other words, it is one that has special reference to the family circle.<a name=79:10></a> It is a commandment that implies mutual obligations; that is the best expression I know for the passage, it is not only mutuality, it is mutual obligations, and I would press obligations.<a name=79:11></a>

		Every true Christian is essentially a worshipper, for the knowledge of God must ever produce a deep and reverential consciousness that He is worthy of adoring response from every heart that has tasted His love.<a name=93:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The character of this response will, however, be dependent upon the measure of light and knowledge of God which is possessed by the worshipper.<a name=93:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the past, God was known and worshipped as Jehovah.<a name=93:4></a> That He desired this response from His people is clearly seen by the injunctions given to them as to the offering of the firstfruits (<a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#26:1">Deuteronomy  26:1</a> - 11).<a name=93:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As the favoured Israelite, having entered into the land flowing with milk and honey and dwelling therein, reaped the fruit of the earth, he was to take the first of all the fruit, put it in a basket and go to the place which God chose to place His name there.<a name=93:6></a> The offerer was then to say, "behold, I have brought the first of the fruits of the land, which thou, Jehovah, hast given me" (verse 10), and set it before Jehovah, and <i>worship</i>.<a name=93:7></a> How suitable it was that God's great goodness should thus be recognised and that the response of a grateful heart should be expressed in the offering!<a name=93:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Yet this did not reach to the height of worship which is now the holy privilege of the Christian, in the power of the Holy Spirit of God!<a name=93:9></a>

		The grandeur and dignity of this could only be unfolded by the Lord Jesus, God's beloved Son.<a name=94:1></a> How marvellously it was told by Him to the woman of Samaria in these beautiful words: "But the hour is coming and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth; for also the Father seeks such as his worshippers.<a name=94:2></a> God is a Spirit; and they who worship him must worship him in spirit and truth" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#4:23">John  4:23</a>, 24).<a name=94:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Adoringly, too, we reverence the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ as the Object of worship, and rightly so, for He is God.<a name=94:4></a> Prophetically it was written concerning Him, "he is thy Lord, and worship thou him" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#45:11">Psalm  45:11</a>).<a name=94:5></a> It was as to Him that it was written, "when he brings in the firstborn into the habitable world, he says, And let all God's angels worship him" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:6">Hebrews  1:6</a>).<a name=94:6></a>

		The following thoughts upon Christian worship, expressed by one long since with the Lord, are worthy of consideration: 'In worshipping the Father I go to One who, in infinite, uncaused love, has revealed Himself to me; brought me into the place of son; not spared His own Son for me; reconciled me to Himself by Him; and given me His Spirit that I may have the consciousness of the place He has put me in, so that I cry',Abba, Father'.<a name=94:7></a> It is God, but it is God known as Father'.<a name=94:8></a>

		In <a href="../bible/John.htm#12:3">John  12:3</a> Mary of Bethany is most touchingly seen as a worshipper of the Son of God.<a name=95:2></a> There came a moment when Jesus was in her home and she seized the opportunity of anointing His feet, and then laid her glory -- her hair -- at His feet.<a name=95:3></a> She poured upon Him the spikenard, very costly, and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.<a name=95:4></a> This was the act of a true worshipper.<a name=95:5></a> It is encouraging that it was a sister who did this, for it indicates that it is for sisters as well as for brothers to worship.<a name=95:6></a> While all audible expression of worship in the assembly is, in the Lord's ordering, restricted to men, for women are to keep silence in the assembly (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14:34">1 Corinthians  14:34</a>), yet worship is to be rendered by all, sisters and brothers alike.<a name=95:7></a> There is a true dignity in the worship and service of the sisters, of whom Mary was one of the most distinguished.<a name=95:8></a> She was the one who carried out this wonderful service upon the Lord's Person, which constituted an act of worship.<a name=95:9></a> She lavished her all upon the Son of God: she crowned Him, exalted and worshipped Him.<a name=95:10></a>

		How important it is to recognise that the flesh can have no part in christian worship.<a name=96:2></a> A fleshly religion will not yield glory to God.<a name=96:3></a> There would not be a single feature of Christ reproduced if the flesh had its way: for "That which is born of the flesh is flesh" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:6">John  3:6</a>).<a name=96:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One of the most encouraging features of christian worship is that it is open even to the young.<a name=96:5></a> Was it not the <i>children</i> who were crying in the temple and saying, "Hosanna to the son of David"?<a name=96:6></a> Of whom Jesus said, "Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#21:15">Matthew  21:15</a>, 16).<a name=96:7></a> God would have children to love and worship Him; for even a child (in years) who receives the Holy Spirit is capacitated to worship God.<a name=96:8></a>

		Thus, as worshippers, would we hasten on to the day of glory when as it is said, "his servants shall serve him" (or, as it may be rendered, "his servants shall worship him") (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:3">Revelation  22:3</a>).<a name=96:9></a> Then shall there be a full and eternal response to God and to His great love and then will He "rest in his love" (<a href="../bible/Zephaniah.htm#3">Zephaniah  3</a>).<a name=96:10></a>

		Well, beloved friends, it is a very humbling subject to us; still it is no less true, that to have the whole truth is one of the marks, one of the accompaniments, of knowing the Lord in the midst of His own, gathered together to His name.<a name=97:2></a> For my part, I cannot conceive anything more really interesting -- because it is not to angels, but to us that the Holy Spirit makes known the truth: "he shall guide you into all the truth".<a name=97:3></a> If you look into all the sects in Christendom, what you are met with on every hand is that each assumes to have more truth than its fellows; or at least one particular truth that others have not.<a name=97:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We cannot but see the importance of having all the truth.<a name=97:5></a> And though I am very far from assuming that we have it in its fulness, still I do trust there is the earnest desire after the truth.<a name=97:6></a> The apostle warns Timothy that the time would come when they would not listen to the truth, but would be turned away to fables.<a name=97:7></a> He speaks of those who were the mischief workers, they "withstand the truth" (2 Timothy 3: 8) -- not a truth, but the truth.<a name=97:8></a>

		What I propose to present to you, as well as I am able, is what really the truth is.<a name=97:9></a> Because here the Spirit of God, not the church, guides into it; and one of the failures of Christendom is the boast, that the church expounds the truth.<a name=97:10></a> No doubt the church has it; all the truth there is, is in the church.<a name=97:11></a> There is a verse in Timothy (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3:15">1 Timothy  3:15</a>), which is not

	<div class="paragraph">
		The danger I apprehend, and I warn you of it, is that the truth is slipping away; for the truth is being weakened and diluted, and you will find that as the truth becomes weakened, every section of it becomes weakened.<a name=98:7></a> The more you advance in truth, the more you advance all round: you cannot advance on one alone without distorting all.<a name=98:8></a> If a man is a great man, he has not only good eyes and good ears, all his qualities are good.<a name=98:9></a> So with a tree -- all the branches contribute to the tree.<a name=98:10></a> There can be no greater testimony to the importance among ourselves of the truth, than the assertion of each of the sects, that it has more than its fellows.<a name=98:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before I enlarge on what I have in my mind, I am going to ask you to recall the fact that James wrote to the twelve tribes scattered, and there was danger with them lest they should carry on religious services and observances in an outward form.<a name=107:3></a> I understand the word "religion" (verse 27) means outward service, possibly of a superstitious character.<a name=107:4></a> If there be a fall from the elevation of the worship of God and divine service from the region of spiritual power, the thing becomes formal; and there is a danger of being marked by what is superstitious.<a name=107:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		James had in mind some who were religious, but men who evidently were not able to bridle their tongues.<a name=107:6></a> There is an injunction in Scripture to this effect: our words are to be few (<a href="../bible/Ecclesiastes.htm#5:2">Ecclesiastes  5:2</a>).<a name=107:7></a> The greater the power, the fewer the words.<a name=107:8></a> The greater the measure of spirituality, the larger the measure of simplicity.<a name=107:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		James speaks in regard to some who were outwardly religious, but who did not bridle their tongues.<a name=107:10></a> He says their religion is vain, there is nothing in it.<a name=107:11></a> He proceeds to say, Pure religion consists in this: that one visits the fatherless and widows in their affliction and keeps oneself unspotted from the world.<a name=107:12></a> In regard to the service of visiting, I believe we should represent God Himself -- in speaking the word we should represent the Lord.<a name=107:13></a> Every trait of moral blessedness or excellency finds its expression

		I allude, first of all, to the presentation of the gospel to a sinner, and in regard to this we may learn from the approach of God to Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden.<a name=108:6></a> I need not enlarge on their sin; it is too well known to need any elaboration, but I want you to observe the way in which God made His visit.<a name=108:7></a> It says, "And they heard the voice of Jehovah Elohim, walking in the garden in the cool of the day" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#3:8">Genesis  3:8</a>).<a name=108:8></a> Although the persons to whom He drew near had sinned, yet He selected a propitious moment in which to draw near, "the cool of the day".<a name=108:9></a> There was no form -- there was a voice.<a name=108:10></a> Afterwards we have an allusion to the conversation.<a name=108:11></a> The sin of the woman and of the man was terrible, as far as they were concerned.<a name=108:12></a> Was there a voice of thunder suitable to the occasion?<a name=108:13></a> No.<a name=108:14></a> God waited for a propitious moment in which to draw near.<a name=108:15></a>

		Peter refers in his second epistle to "holy men of God", suggesting the kind of vessel in which the Spirit moves in view of utterances coming forth for the edification of the saints of God.<a name=125:2></a> It would seem as if Peter has the foundations of the assembly before him, his basic thought being that there should be <i>holy</i> men who are available to give expression to the Spirit's mind.<a name=125:3></a> Peter says, "no prophecy of the scripture is had from its own interpretation, for prophecy was not ever uttered by the will of man, but holy men of God spake under the power of the Holy Spirit".<a name=125:4></a> In addition to the fact of inspiration, the passage seems to show us the vast possibilities of the Scriptures, and that today the movements of the Holy Spirit would be on the line of opening up what we have as available at all times in Scripture with a fresh touch for edification.<a name=125:5></a>

		As appreciating these possibilities we are reminded that they are connected with holiness -- holiness being a great thought with Peter.<a name=125:6></a> The first epistle of Peter speaks of holy <i>women</i> (chapter 3: 5) and the second epistle of holy <i>men</i>.<a name=125:7></a> 1 Corinthians speaks of men and women -- men praying or prophesying and women praying or prophesying (chapter 11: 4, 5).<a name=125:8></a> Perhaps we have not sufficiently taken account of both brothers and sisters as having part in the assembly and being marked by both prayer and prophecy -- not that women are audibly to pray or to prophesy in the assembly, but to be silent -- but Peter and Paul, two

		The second of Acts refers to the giving of the Spirit: "this is that which was spoken through the prophet Joel, And it shall be in the last days, saith God, that I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your elders shall dream with dreams".<a name=126:2></a> I would just refer to the elder brethren and the younger brethren.<a name=126:3></a> God would make use of both old and young in this blessed service of voicing the mind of God.<a name=126:4></a> So I read also the two passages in the Old Testament.<a name=126:5></a> The first one suggests to us movements of the Spirit of God in connection with a young brother.<a name=126:6></a> The Spirit of God began to move Samson.<a name=126:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Before, however, we come to the introduction of Samson we have much said about his parents.<a name=126:8></a> The 'parents' might well suggest to our minds all the saints in connection with the subjective conditions amongst us.<a name=126:9></a> The Spirit draws attention to Samson's mother -- we are told what the angel of God said to her.<a name=126:10></a> The fact of this son being born corresponds, perhaps, with what God has done in these last days, in so largely blessing the young ones among us.<a name=126:11></a> The scripture says the woman was barren.<a name=126:12></a> There was breakdown and failure, but God moves sovereignly.<a name=126:13></a> The Angel of God made the announcement to her

		and he impressed upon her that her son was to be a Nazarite and that she herself was to abstain from wine and strong drink and everything unclean.<a name=127:1></a> One feels if we are to have amongst us vessels of this character, young and fresh, that we who are older -- indeed, <i>all of us</i> -- must be concerned as to our spiritual condition -- our food and our drink, nothing exciting to the flesh, nothing unclean; for the son should be a Nazarite.<a name=127:2></a> God would remind us that holiness is essential, that we must be found feeding only on what is holy, so that there might be young men whom the Spirit of God can move.<a name=127:3></a> We are not to expect the older men only to be moved, but young men also.<a name=127:4></a> One would appeal to the young to be available to be moved by the Spirit of God and to <i>speak</i> in relation to His movements.<a name=127:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We find Samson in a day of great weakness and reproach, but the Spirit of God "began to move him", suggesting the making known in that day the communications of the Holy Spirit.<a name=127:6></a> Deep exercise is doubtless required, but how sweet the result!<a name=127:7></a> There is not much recorded as to Samson's ministry, but there is one outstanding contribution that has yielded much as directing the hearts and minds of the saints to Christ: "Out of the eater came forth food, and out of the strong came forth sweetness" (chapter 14: 14).<a name=127:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		This scripture we have read in Zechariah brings before us how God is operating to secure His own thoughts and purposes.<a name=129:9></a> It is a great matter to take account of the fact that God is going to accomplish what He desires; Job could say, "I know … that thou canst be hindered in no thought of thine" (<a href="../bible/Job.htm#42:2">Job  42:2</a>).<a name=129:10></a> So God is working to secure that which is suitable to Himself.<a name=129:11></a> He would clothe believers with glory.<a name=129:12></a>

		Let us take account of that, beloved.<a name=130:1></a> Satan is ever near us individually and in our gatherings to obstruct what God is doing in and among His people, but we can see from this scripture how God triumphs over all.<a name=130:2></a> In Jude, Michael "did not dare" to rebuke Satan; God alone could do it (<a href="../bible/Jude.htm#9">Jude  9</a>).<a name=130:3></a> And so He does here.<a name=130:4></a> He comes in quickly: "Jehovah said unto Satan, Jehovah rebuke thee, O Satan!<a name=130:5></a> Yea, Jehovah that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee!<a name=130:6></a>" What an amazing rebuke that was!<a name=130:7></a> God came in to draw attention to His own work.<a name=130:8></a>

		"And I said, Let them set a pure turban upon his head".<a name=131:7></a> The turban was an essential part of the priest's garments, suggestive that we are not to be marked by fleshly thinking or mental excitement, but that we should be sober, and in a state that we can think for God.<a name=131:8></a> That is what the priest was to do -- to think for God, and act for God.<a name=131:9></a> The turban would involve that our thoughts are dignified and holy, preserved for God.<a name=131:10></a> He would have us to be clothed with holy garments that are suitable to His holy nature.<a name=131:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The passage in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#61">Isaiah  61</a>has in view a time of recovery and we find God coming in "to comfort all that mourn; to appoint unto them that mourn …".<a name=132:4></a> What a great matter it is to recognise that God would appoint certain circumstances for us and bring us into His courts, into His house.<a name=132:5></a> He would have us to be there suitably, and that is why it says, "that beauty should be given unto them instead of ashes".<a name=132:6></a> Ashes would represent a repenting condition, but then there is a time for rejoicing and that is when this matter would come in: "that beauty should be given unto them instead of ashes".<a name=132:7></a> Instead of sadness and sorrow as connected with mourning, God would bring in this thought of beauty, He would give us to know the beauty of all that He finds in Christ, and He would have His people formed by it so that they are clothed in beauty instead of ashes.<a name=132:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"The oil of joy instead of mourning".<a name=132:9></a> The oil of joy would suggest what should characterise us as we make way for the Spirit in our lives, our walk, our conversation.<a name=132:10></a> It means that the people of God are to be dignified -- their movements are dignified, their actions are dignified, and their thoughts too are dignified.<a name=132:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then what affected me was this other reference: "the garment of praise instead of the spirit of heaviness".<a name=132:12></a> We have all known, no doubt, in our

		histories, the spirit of heaviness.<a name=133:1></a> It involves that there has been departure in our souls from Christ, and so we do not see beauty in Him in the way that we did previously.<a name=133:2></a> God would afford us the garment of praise.<a name=133:3></a> The garment is what characterises persons, hence "the garment of praise" is for persons who are able to praise and worship God.<a name=133:4></a> It is a very beautiful thought.<a name=133:5></a> God is doing this, I believe, at the present time, and it is for each one of us to acquire a "garment of praise".<a name=133:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then it goes on to say, "that they might be called terebinths of righteousness, the planting of Jehovah, that he may be glorified".<a name=133:7></a> The thought is that God should be glorified in His people as they move here under His eye.<a name=133:8></a> Terebinths would bring in the thought of stability; they cannot be shaken.<a name=133:9></a> Let us cling to God's thoughts, and He will bring us through our exercises for His glory.<a name=133:10></a> He is glorified, as we were saying already, when He sees the features of Christ coming out among His beloved people, when, instead of being marked by the spirit of heaviness, they are marked by having "the garment of praise".<a name=133:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It says in verse 10, "I will greatly rejoice in Jehovah, my soul shall be joyful in my God".<a name=133:12></a> What a great matter that is!<a name=133:13></a> That is the expression of an overcomer moving through this contrary scene, where Satan is active, seeking to divert the believer.<a name=133:14></a> But if we say, "my soul shall be joyful in my God", it suggests that we each have a relationship with God, that we can say, in wonderful grace, "my God".<a name=133:15></a>

		garments of salvation".<a name=134:1></a> That is another wonderful garment.<a name=134:2></a> That suggests that one is free from the influences of the world.<a name=134:3></a> You remember that David, in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#132">Psalm  132</a>, says, "Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness, and let thy saints shout for joy" (verse 9).<a name=134:4></a> The first feature that should mark us is righteousness.<a name=134:5></a> Later Jehovah says, "I will clothe her priests with salvation" (verse 16).<a name=134:6></a> That is just what we are speaking of here.<a name=134:7></a> The garments of salvation have been provided for us.<a name=134:8></a> "And her saints shall shout aloud for joy" (verse 16).<a name=134:9></a> You can see the two things are linked, beloved -- the garment of salvation and the garment of righteousness -- and should result in the sound of joy among the people of God.<a name=134:10></a> It is a great matter to be "covered .<a name=134:11></a>.<a name=134:12></a>.<a name=134:13></a> with the robe of righteousness".<a name=134:14></a> God would have us to be before Him as Christ is, and to be occupied with Christ where He is.<a name=134:15></a> "Even as <i>he</i> is, <i>we</i> also are in this world" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:17">1 John  4:17</a>).<a name=134:16></a>

		"As a bridegroom decketh himself with the priestly turban".<a name=134:17></a> The priestly turban suggests that you are thinking for God; natural thoughts are shut out, and you are able to think for God.<a name=134:18></a> Then the bride "adorneth herself with her jewels".<a name=134:19></a> That belongs to the bridal attire.<a name=134:20></a> Freshness and beauty is suggested in that attire.<a name=134:21></a>

		In reading these Scriptures I want to bring before you the thought that God seeks in us a certain spiritual prosperity, so that we may always have something with which to minister to others.<a name=147:12></a> God looks for practical answers in His people to the great wealth with which He has enriched us in Christ.<a name=147:13></a> In Ephesians the gospel is said to be the gospel of "the unsearchable riches of the Christ" (chapter 3: 8); and obviously it is not simply to make known these riches, but that those who believe should have part in them.<a name=147:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The passage in 2 Corinthians shows how it is possible for us to have part in them.<a name=147:15></a> The Lord, having been rich, became poor on our account; it refers to His incarnation and death, "that <i>ye</i> by <i>his</i> poverty might be enriched".<a name=147:16></a> The fact that He became poor is

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=148>[Page 148]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		one of the most touching that can be spoken of.<a name=148:1></a> That He came into poor material circumstances is a fact; it is also evident, when the question of tribute was raised, that He did not possess money.<a name=148:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another sense in which He was poor.<a name=148:3></a> It is said in the Psalms, "This poor man cried" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#34:6">Psalm  34:6</a>, A.<a name=148:4></a>V.<a name=148:5></a>) -- one having no outward means of help.<a name=148:6></a> He came into these circumstances in grace.<a name=148:7></a> What can touch the heart more than that?<a name=148:8></a> Think of the Lord of glory becoming poor!<a name=148:9></a> Poor, not only in material things, but in the sense that there was no outward means of help or support.<a name=148:10></a> Jehovah heard Him, of course, but that is another matter; outwardly He was poor.<a name=148:11></a> So we have, "Blessed is he that understandeth the poor" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#41:1">Psalm  41:1</a>).<a name=148:12></a> On the cross, I suppose, it was seen in its full measure, when He cried, and there was no help at all.<a name=148:13></a> He was without support.<a name=148:14></a> He was alone.<a name=148:15></a> We cannot measure that, we can only refer to it with feeling, one trusts, and in a worshipful spirit.<a name=148:16></a> He was pleased to be found thus in order that we should be rich, "that <i>ye</i> by <i>his</i> poverty might be enriched".<a name=148:17></a> How touching that is!<a name=148:18></a> The Spirit of God brings in these thoughts of poverty and riches, because He is going to speak of giving, in a material way, for the help of the Lord's people.<a name=148:19></a> God employs these words and one is touched by them; and, as I say, they are most blessed!<a name=148:20></a>

		What one would remark on is that we should be rich spiritually; God loves to see the wealth that He has enriched us with in Christ worked out in our souls, so that we move about here in a certain

		spiritual dignity and magnanimity.<a name=149:1></a> God looks for these things; He hates the smallness and niggardliness which belong to the flesh.<a name=149:2></a> As regards Paul, he was "as poor, but enriching many".<a name=149:3></a> There was a largeness of soul in him, and so he says, "Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your affections" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#6:10">2 Corinthians  6:10</a>, 12).<a name=149:4></a> The principles of the world had got amongst the Corinthians, and so they had become narrowed in their affections.<a name=149:5></a> Even the philanthropist, so called, of the world is small, he has in view his own greatness; whereas, in Christianity, it is what God is, it is the greatness of God expressed through His people; and so the apostle looked for spiritual expansion amongst the Corinthians.<a name=149:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Through these letters, he labours to bring that about, and in <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#8">2 Corinthians  8</a>and 9, he deals with this subject of giving, and brings in these words, involving what is so touching in regard to our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=149:7></a> At the end of chapter 8 he speaks about those who carried the bounty of the saints; he says, "Whether as regards Titus, he is my companion and fellow-labourer in your behalf; or our brethren, they are deputed messengers of assemblies, Christ's glory" (verse 23).<a name=149:8></a> What a touch as to the merit of what is in view!<a name=149:9></a> although the thing is material in itself, it expresses what Christ is; "Christ's glory".<a name=149:10></a> In that simple service there was the shining out of what Christ is now in all His wealth, "Christ's glory".<a name=149:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		To go back to the riches with which we are enriched, I would remark on the working out of it in the assembly, and so in chapter 14 of the first

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the Old Testament we have abundant foreshadowings of what is in the mind of God; in the history of creation we see how He arranged things, that although He could create out of nothing, yet His thought was that the earth should bring forth fruit, so that man and beast should have food.<a name=150:6></a> "The cattle on a thousand hills" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#50:10">Psalm  50:10</a>) were indirectly the product of the earth; and vegetables too, of all kinds.<a name=150:7></a> The idea, on the part of God, was that the earth should bring forth, and that man should be sustained by what the earth yielded.<a name=150:8></a> The manna was an exception; manna suggests that there was no fruit on the earth, for the wilderness was a sterile place, and in it there was nothing for man or beast, but the manna came down from heaven.<a name=150:9></a> The thought of God is that something should be developed in the way of fruit; He gave His sunshine and rain to water the earth.<a name=150:10></a> In <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#6">Hebrews  6</a>it is said that "ground which drinks the rain which comes often upon it, and produces useful herbs for those for whose sakes also it is tilled,

	<div class="paragraph">
		God looks for results.<a name=151:4></a> When you come to Exodus you have the same principle: God could easily have provided means to meet their requirements for the tabernacle but it must come through the affections of the people; and it is very cheering to see how the people responded; there was an excess (chapter 36: 5 - 7).<a name=151:5></a> The tabernacle was made according to the pattern, but the material came in the way of a heave-offering from His people.<a name=151:6></a> And so today God's thought is to work through the spiritual gifts of His people.<a name=151:7></a> They did not all bring the same thing for the tabernacle; but in result the material was all brought and there was abundance.<a name=151:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so in Leviticus, where you have God dwelling amongst His people, he speaks of offerings.<a name=151:9></a> There were burnt-offerings, meat-offerings (oblations), peace-offerings, and in each case the people were supposed to have <i>something</i>, a handful of meal if nothing more.<a name=151:10></a> There was a variety of gifts, so that the rich and the poor could each contribute.<a name=151:11></a> Mutuality is a great thought in Scripture; that is, that each one has part, either in contributing to what we are brought into or receiving of it.<a name=151:12></a> God blesses each of us, the rain comes upon us all, and hence God looks for fruit, even from the very poorest spiritually, so that no one is shut out.<a name=151:13></a> "But to each one of us has

		And then in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#7">Numbers  7</a>we have a most remarkable evidence of spiritual giving; that is, in the <i>princes</i>.<a name=152:2></a> The princes each gave the same, and it was bountiful giving.<a name=152:3></a> Princes are men who are spiritually great; they are spiritually well off.<a name=152:4></a> We were remarking on the apostle Paul, how in writing to Philemon he uses his means for the benefit of another (verse 18); so these princes gave freely of the wealth they had, and in result it expressed the practical unity that existed in Israel.<a name=152:5></a> There was no rivalry between them; their gifts expressed their practical unity.<a name=152:6></a> They all had the same love for Christ and for His people, we may say.<a name=152:7></a> They provided wagons for the Levites who had heavy burdens to bear; they gave with a measure of intelligence as to what was needed.<a name=152:8></a> In the book of Numbers, as I said, these princes express the practical unity that should be seen among the people of God, in the way of spiritual giving.<a name=152:9></a> Then we may refer to the giving of David.<a name=152:10></a> In first Chronicles we read of the wealth with which he lavishly, one might say, and with intelligent affection, provided for the house of God; and on the part of the people also there was abundant giving for the house that was to be built.<a name=152:11></a> Read <a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#28">1 Chronicles  28</a>and 29.<a name=152:12></a>

		There are certain scripture terms in common use amongst us with which most are very familiar, but to which we should, if challenged, find it perhaps difficult to attach any very distinct or definite meaning, or to clearly distinguish one from another.<a name=153:15></a> Such are "the old man", "sin", and "the flesh", the intimate connection between which must be evident enough
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=154>[Page 154]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		to all.<a name=154:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I propose to enlarge on the terms a little, in the hope that the moral force of each may be more clearly apprehended.<a name=154:2></a> I may say, at the outset, that I am unable to realise much difference between the old man and the flesh.<a name=154:3></a> "Old man" may perhaps present a more complete idea than "flesh".<a name=154:4></a> "Old man" describes a certain order of man which can now be designated as old, because the new has appeared on the scene.<a name=154:5></a> I am not aware that the expressions 'old' and 'new man' are found save in Ephesians and Colossians, in both of which the thought of creation is introduced in connection with the new man.<a name=154:6></a> We find there the old and new man set strongly in contrast -- the one after, or according to, the lusts of deceit, the other created after or according to God.<a name=154:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I judge that the term 'man' speaks of an order of intelligent being set in certain relationships, and endowed with affections suited to those relationships; and this is true in both the old and new man, though in the old all is marred by sin.<a name=154:8></a> The term 'man' conveys to us the idea of what is outward and evident, an object to be apprehended by the mind or senses, and thus the new man is for the Christian the foundation of testimony.<a name=154:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in 'flesh' the point of contrast is not 'the new man', but 'the Spirit' or 'spirit'; and the idea is thus evidently in distinction from that of 'man', who can be apprehended as an object.<a name=154:10></a> The term plainly conveys to us the thought of what is inward or subjective -- a source of thought and feeling and

		<a name=155>[Page 155]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		purpose.<a name=155:1></a> It is undoubtedly used in a moral sense, and hence presents more than the thought of mere animal existence or nature.<a name=155:2></a> A man may be 'after the flesh' or 'after the Spirit' -- may find his springs in the one or in the other.<a name=155:3></a> But if in the one, he is, so to say, abstracted from the other.<a name=155:4></a> Now it is plain that this abstraction could not be until the Spirit was given.<a name=155:5></a> In Old Testament saints faith was evidently a most potent factor, and as they were helped of God there was practical righteousness; but until the cross there had not been such a setting aside of the flesh for God's glory as that the Spirit could be communicated, and consequently the saint in his experience could not be abstracted from the flesh as to his <i>habitual</i> moral state.<a name=155:6></a> He was even as a saint in the flesh.<a name=155:7></a> It was the state in which God took account of him, though, withal, helping him in it, or in spite of it.<a name=155:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'The flesh' is so habitually used in connection with sin and evil, that it becomes a little difficult to identify the term with an unfallen being like Adam; and yet I think it might be said that "in the flesh" was true of Adam, though, of course, without evil.<a name=155:9></a> Evidently the love of God was not shed abroad in his heart by the Holy Spirit given to him, nor did he find his springs of affection, feeling, and thought in the Spirit, though as God's handiwork he was very good.<a name=155:10></a> Now, alas!<a name=155:11></a> flesh is characteristically flesh of sin.<a name=155:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think that we have seen thus far that, while 'old' or 'new man' presents the idea of an object or order which is evident and observable, 'flesh', in

		contrast to it, gives the idea of a moral spring which governs the mind, temper, and spirit of man, and has its issue in practice.<a name=156:1></a> And in this connection we may take up the subject of sin.<a name=156:2></a> It is clear that sin exists apart from the state of man or flesh, for the devil sins from the outset.<a name=156:3></a> It is a principle that has come into the world by man, and that holds man in bondage; and the scripture has defined it as 'lawlessness', i.<a name=156:4></a>e.<a name=156:5></a>, creature will impatient of restraint.<a name=156:6></a> Now will, as in flesh, may be spoken of in an innocent sense, i.<a name=156:7></a>e.<a name=156:8></a>, as mechanical -- the power of volition.<a name=156:9></a> A man must will to lift up his hand in order to lift it up, and this is part of flesh or man's bodily condition.<a name=156:10></a> It is not in this sense that we are now speaking of will, but purely in a moral sense -- in the sense in which, in its full development, it will be seen in antichrist -- defiant disregard of, and opposition to, God.<a name=156:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is perfectly compatible with a morality (like that of Paul) which claims and obtains the respect of man.<a name=156:12></a> The fact is that sin, as to the principle of it, is only known in relation to God, and it is the full revelation of God in Christ that has brought out sin in its enormity.<a name=156:13></a> The Lord said, "If I had not come and spoken to them, they had not had sin" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#15:22">John  15:22</a>); and the testimony of Christ brought out the fact that hatred of God is an essential and necessary element of sin -- God is not only defied, but hated.<a name=156:14></a> But this may and does exist in the condition of flesh; hence it is, I think, simple to apprehend the distinction between 'sin', 'the old man', and 'the flesh'.<a name=156:15></a>

		No intelligent believer would claim inspiration as to the <i>order</i> of the books of the New Testament; at the same time it has been felt to be striking that the epistle to the Philippians should follow that to the Ephesians.<a name=157:1></a> It seems fitting and right that it should be so, for Philippians gives you a practical illustration of the truth which is so characteristic of Ephesians.<a name=157:2></a> Without going into detail, I would remark that what is so prominent in Ephesians is the heavenly side of our calling.<a name=157:3></a> When Paul was writing to Timothy he said, "But <i>thou</i> hast been thoroughly acquainted with my teaching, conduct …" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#3:10">2 Timothy  3:10</a>).<a name=157:4></a> Paul was the living embodiment and exemplification of his teaching.<a name=157:5></a> It was Paul who wrote Ephesians, and Paul, as seen in his epistle to the Philippians, is the embodiment of his teaching in that epistle.<a name=157:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is no epistle, of all those written by Paul, that gives you such an insight into his experience as a Christian as Philippians.<a name=157:7></a> It is not, strictly speaking, an apostolic epistle.<a name=157:8></a> Paul does not write to them in the character of apostle.<a name=157:9></a> In the beginning of it he says, "Paul … <i>bondman</i> of Jesus Christ", and he associates Timothy with himself in that word "bondman" .<a name=157:10></a>.<a name=157:11></a>.<a name=157:12></a> So the epistle to the Philippians has been spoken of as an epistle of christian experience, and we do well to recall what has been said by our brother (T.<a name=157:13></a>H.<a name=157:14></a>R.<a name=157:15></a>) -- '<i>Christianity is Christ</i>!<a name=157:16></a>' That is a beautiful statement!<a name=157:17></a> The more you think of it the

		The Lord is bringing before us in these days much that is connected with the greatest truths of Christianity, the highest privileges of the assembly, intending that we should have power to move into these things, and that requires spirituality; but I believe that before we can be spiritual, we must become marked by righteousness practically, and piety.<a name=161:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will remember that the Scripture speaks of Simeon in the second chapter of Luke's gospel; how the Holy Spirit was upon him and that it had been revealed to him by the Spirit that he should not see death till he had seen the Lord's Christ; and how he came in the Spirit into the temple (verses 25 - 27).<a name=161:4></a> He was one who was evidently characterised in large measure by spirituality, by being spiritual.<a name=161:5></a> But before saying these things about him, it says that he was just and pious, meaning that he was characteristically righteous practically in all his ways and that he was pious; and I believe those two things, practical righteousness and piety, are essential foundations to spirituality.<a name=161:6></a> That is, unless we are concerned and helped of the Lord to maintain righteousness practically in every detail of life and to cultivate piety, we

		Now this first epistle to Timothy says much about piety.<a name=162:4></a> If you read through the epistle, I think you will be perhaps surprised at the constant references to piety, or godliness as it is rendered in the Authorised Version.<a name=162:5></a> In chapter 2 the apostle exhorts "first of all that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgiving be made for all men; for kings and all that are in dignity, that we may lead a quiet and tranquil live in all piety and gravity".<a name=162:6></a> It was a prominent thought in the mind of the apostle, so that he gives exhortation "<i>first of all</i>", and with a view to this, that we may lead quiet and peaceable lives, in all piety and gravity; for, he says, "this is good and acceptable before our Saviour God, who desires that all men should be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth".<a name=162:7></a>

		The great power for salvation from things of that sort is the knowledge of God, and piety brings the knowledge of God into our everyday circumstances; so that we are encouraged to prayer and supplication, intercession and thanksgiving.<a name=163:4></a> All these are things that belong to the knowledge of God; indeed intercession is a wonderful privilege; it is the exercise by those who know God of their privilege of drawing near to God; it is the privilege of exercising that power on behalf of others.<a name=163:5></a>

		It is beyond question that one outstanding feature needed in the day in which we live is <i>loyalty</i>.<a name=172:12></a> It is a burning question the world over.<a name=172:13></a> Every nation is counting upon the loyalty of its people.<a name=172:14></a> It is one of the greatest privileges of the Christian to be marked by loyalty to Christ, so that He may count upon us in a crisis -- that there may be no wavering, but, as walking in a straight path, the Lord may

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The flesh is untrustworthy in everyone.<a name=173:4></a> All that we are as children of Adam would betray Christ; but in every heart that has been won by the love of God, in every soul in whom the Spirit of God dwells, there is a deep desire to be preserved in loyalty to Christ unto the end.<a name=173:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Enoch furnishes a stirring example.<a name=173:6></a> A crisis had arisen, and it seemed as if the enemy had the whole world under his control, and that there was nothing remaining for God; but "Enoch walked with God" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#5:22">Genesis  5:22</a>).<a name=173:7></a> For three hundred years after the birth of Methushelah he was marked by unswerving fidelity to Him.<a name=173:8></a> Nothing caused him to deviate from that path.<a name=173:9></a> He was apparently converted at the time of the birth of his son.<a name=173:10></a> He lived a normal life as a man on earth.<a name=173:11></a> He begat sons and daughters.<a name=173:12></a> His life was not lived in isolation, and yet it could be recorded that he "walked with God; and he was not, for God took him"(verse 24).<a name=173:13></a> Centuries after, the epistle to the Hebrews tells us that "By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him; for before his translation he has the testimony that he had pleased God" (chapter 11: 5).<a name=173:14></a> To him was given a measure of light, and

	<div class="paragraph">
		<center>WALK</center>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		of communion, which is so essential -- to speak to God and let Him speak to us.<a name=174:5></a> While we are living the ordinary lives of persons on earth, we may live in communion with God, and prove that every difficulty but gives a fresh opportunity of drawing near to Him.<a name=174:6></a> The greatest objective that any person could have is to be pleasing to the Lord in all things; but to reach this it is necessary to continue to be faithful to the light which He has given.<a name=174:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another feature is the necessity for loyalty to the Person of Christ.<a name=174:8></a> It will be recalled that in the history of David there came a crisis when many turned away from him.<a name=174:9></a> Absalom, his son, had usurped the throne, having stolen the hearts of the men of Israel, so that David had to flee (<a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#15:14">2 Samuel  15:14</a>).<a name=174:10></a> As he was going, there came up to him a Gentile who exhibited one of the most beautiful features of loyalty recorded in the Old Testament: Ittai the Gittite (verse 19), was recognised by David to be a stranger and an exile, hence he gave him the opportunity of going back with his brethren.<a name=174:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But such was the grandeur of that man's loyalty, that, looking at David in affection, he said: "As Jehovah liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely

		<a name=175>[Page 175]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		in what place my lord the king shall be, surely in death or life, even there also will thy servant be" (verse 21).<a name=175:1></a> The king was in rejection, despised, and refused, and yet Ittai was prepared to follow him!<a name=175:2></a> How the king could trust a man like that!<a name=175:3></a> We do not wonder that the day came when David could entrust to him the charge of one-third of his army (<a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#18:2">2 Samuel  18:2</a>).<a name=175:4></a> The Lord is looking to us to be loyal to Him during the time of His rejection; the day in which men are slighting Him and setting His name at naught.<a name=175:5></a> In this day we are being tested whether we are prepared to be true to Christ.<a name=175:6></a> What must it be to Him to find true fidelity in our hearts!<a name=175:7></a> May we inquire of each one, Has the Lord ever heard such words from your lips?<a name=175:8></a> Has He ever had the joy of receiving you, as David received Ittai, as one upon whom He could count -- a loyal and trustworthy servant!<a name=175:9></a> Have you ever said to the Lord Jesus:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<blockquote>'Take Thou my heart and let it be <br>For ever closed to all but Thee'?<a name=175:10></a> </blockquote>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord entrusts little to those who are not faithful.<a name=175:11></a> It is one of the first features of qualification for service, that we should have such

	<div class="paragraph">
		for Christ that when a crisis arises we can be counted upon.<a name=175:12></a> Let us not think that the path of discipleship and fidelity to Christ is an easy one.<a name=175:13></a> It involves suffering, tests, self-sacrifices, and self-judgment, but it leads to the most profound blessing and joy; it opens up the most glorious possibilities in this life and the most wonderful results in the life

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/John.htm#6:68">John  6:68</a> Peter said, "Lord, to whom shall we go?<a name=176:3></a>".<a name=176:4></a> We appreciate Peter for this.<a name=176:5></a> We know he failed, but the Lord would never forget that there had been a moment in his life when he had thus committed himself.<a name=176:6></a> We would inquire of one who has turned back, Have you ever thought what this means to the heart of Christ?<a name=176:7></a> At one time He shone upon your face, and now you have turned your back on Him.<a name=176:8></a> Yet He has not ceased to shine upon your back!<a name=176:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord inquires of the twelve, "Will <i>ye</i> also go away?<a name=176:10></a>" (verse 67).<a name=176:11></a> Peter rises to the dignity of the position, and in this glorious confession he comforts the heart of Christ, and gives us an example, making us long to take up the language: "Lord, to whom shall we go?<a name=176:12></a> thou hast words of eternal life.<a name=176:13></a> And we have believed and known that thou art the holy one of God" (verses 68, 69).<a name=176:14></a> Men like that are much needed today -- men who can put their feet down firmly and move forward in the definite and positive confession of Christ; not wavering, nor seeking their own gain and advancement, but pursuing a pathway of devoted loyalty to Christ.<a name=176:15></a> Such are the support of the service of God on earth.<a name=176:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A third feature is seen in Judas and Silas (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#15:22">Acts  15:22</a> - 32).<a name=176:17></a> It was not Judas Iscariot, though it is to be noted there was a traitor Judas and a loyal Judas.<a name=176:18></a> We have to ask ourselves, in which company are we?<a name=176:19></a> To be a traitor is a very serious matter.<a name=176:20></a> We

		A most beautiful thing was said about them: "men who have given up their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ".<a name=177:12></a> They were living men capable of taking a message, but they had given up their lives.<a name=177:13></a> The day of

	<div class="paragraph">
		to the Lord's word.<a name=178:2></a> Not one of us would claim to be a Philadelphian, but our earnest prayer is that the features which marked the Philadelphians may characterise us in our day.<a name=178:3></a> This assembly was approved by Him, for He says, "thou … hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:8">Revelation  3:8</a>).<a name=178:4></a> They were loyal to what was entrusted to them.<a name=178:5></a> It is one thing to know the power of God that keeps us, but another to have spiritual power to keep that which the Lord has entrusted to us.<a name=178:6></a> There is no suggestion of retiring from the Lord's service until we retire into the Father's house; but we are exhorted to "hold that fast what thou hast" (verse 11) until the Lord comes.<a name=178:7></a> As we recognise His word, it is as though He gave us a precious jewel, telling us to <i>keep</i> it.<a name=178:8></a> May we never have to acknowledge that we have lost it.<a name=178:9></a> "Keep … the good deposit entrusted" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#6:20">1 Timothy  6:20</a>).<a name=178:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#49">Genesis  49</a>it is really more a history than a blessing, though it is said in verse 28 that Jacob "blessed them".<a name=202:6></a> Judah represents the victorious power by which blessing is brought in, and Joseph is a type of Christ as the One in whom all blessing is established.<a name=202:7></a> It is true that we see in Gad, Asher, and Naphtali a figure of the blessing of those who are brought into the good of what God has brought to pass by Christ as the victorious Accomplisher of His will (Judah) and in Christ as the risen and glorified One -- the Administrator of all His blessing to men (Joseph).<a name=202:8></a> But, along with this, the moral ruin of man, and his entire failure even in presence of the grace of God, are fully developed -- the first in Reuben, Simeon, and Levi, and the second in Zebulun, Issachar, and Daniel All this gives <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#49">Genesis  49</a>the character of a history -- a history, indeed, of God's perfect and blessed ways in Christ, on the one hand, but of man's ruin and failure on the other.<a name=202:9></a>

		But the man of experience cannot give the full and proper blessing of the saints; it needs the man of God to do that.<a name=203:5></a> Solomon was a man of experience, and he could write the book of Ecclesiastes to show that everything under the sun is vanity.<a name=203:6></a> But it needs a man of God like Paul to unfold a Person whose glory eclipses the brightness of the mid-day sun, and scenes of heavenly blessing which are above the sun.<a name=203:7></a> It is the man who is with God, and who knows God's thoughts, who can unfold those thoughts in all their blessedness.<a name=203:8></a> We see something of this in the chapter before us.<a name=203:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In one way, beloved friends, what we have read is a very simple passage of scripture -- it is an appeal on the part of Jeremiah to Jehovah.<a name=225:1></a> The prophet was in circumstances of trial, of reproach and of persecution, and he turns to Jehovah and appeals to Him, asking that He would interpose to avenge him of those who were his persecutors.<a name=225:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In connection with this appeal, we learn what had brought the prophet into these circumstances of reproach and persecution; but before speaking at all of the answer that Jehovah vouchsafed to the prophet, I might say, beloved, that I have taken this scripture and bring it before you, because I believe that the time in which we are now living, in a very important sense, corresponds to the time in which Jeremiah was living; and the circumstances that surrounded Jeremiah find an answer in the circumstances that surround us as the Lord's people, or, if you please, as God's people, at this present time.<a name=225:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I need not tell you that Jeremiah lived on to the close of the history of the people of God in his day (cf.<a name=225:4></a> <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#1:1">Jeremiah  1:1</a> - 3).<a name=225:5></a> Long before this, of course, the nation of Israel had been divided, and, so far as the ten tribes are concerned, their history had closed in judgment; Shalmaneser the Assyrian had carried them away into captivity, and they have been in dispersion to the present day.<a name=225:6></a> They will, as we know,

		be recovered, and will yet be brought back into the land, and the whole nation will be reunited and brought into blessing; but even as to the kingdom of Judah, this prophet lived very near the end; he lived in the days of Josiah the king, and what marked Josiah's time in the beginning?<a name=226:1></a> -- when he came into the kingdom everything was very dark -- they were suffering under the hand of Jehovah the results of their unfaithfulness.<a name=226:2></a> But I just want to say that there was a wonderful revival in the days of Josiah and of Jeremiah.<a name=226:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The house of God was in a very sad state, and the service of God in connection with it was practically well-nigh abandoned; but God wrought -- Josiah was but a youth, but the heart of the young king was in exercise of soul before God, and he began where every true revival generally begins, that is, with God's interests here, and, of course, those interests at that time were centred in the temple -- the house of God -- just as God's interests are now centred in the assembly -- the church of the living God -- the house of God.<a name=226:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So Josiah began to clear up things in connection with the house of God.<a name=226:5></a> Shaphan was the scribe; Hilkijah, the father of Jeremiah, was the high priest, and in connection with the work inaugurated by Jeremiah, Hilkijah discovered in the house of God, the book of the law of God, the book containing the mind of God concerning His beloved people (<a href="../bible/2Kings.htm#22:1">2 Kings  22:1</a> - 8, etc.<a name=226:6></a>).<a name=226:7></a> I must only speak briefly, but the book was given to Shaphan the scribe, and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=227>[Page 227]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Shaphan carried it to the king, and the book was read, and the finding and the reading of that book was the beginning of a wonderful revival among God's people.<a name=227:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Jeremiah alludes to this.<a name=227:2></a> In connection with his appeal to Jehovah, he writes his own personal experience; he says, "Thy words were found, and I did eat them" (<a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#15:16">Jeremiah  15:16</a>).<a name=227:3></a> Hilkijah, the father of Jeremiah, literally found them; but it is not the details that I dwell on, but with the fact itself.<a name=227:4></a> What a wonderful thing!<a name=227:5></a> "Thy words" -- the very words of Jehovah, setting forth what was in the mind of Jehovah concerning His house, and concerning His people -- concerning His interests here in this scene.<a name=227:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Jeremiah says: "Thy words were found, and I did eat them".<a name=227:7></a> You can understand the figure without any difficulty, because it is a very simple figure; in eating food we appropriate it; and in the appropriation of it we realise the good of it.<a name=227:8></a> Eating food is what we are in the habit of doing constantly and literally, but Jeremiah speaks of eating in a moral sense, though the simplicity of the figure is kept up, and the result of eating the words of Jehovah was that he realised in his own soul the good of those words; and the first result was they made him very happy; he says, "and thy words were unto me the joy and rejoicing of my heart".<a name=227:9></a> But why did they make him so happy?<a name=227:10></a> because those words of Jehovah made known to him the blessed fact of his complete identification with Jehovah, and his complete identification with Jehovah in the way of blessing.<a name=227:11></a> It is
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=228>[Page 228]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		well to know that a person is happy, but it is better to know <i>why</i> they are happy, and Jeremiah tells us why: "thy words were unto me the joy and rejoicing of my heart: for I am called by thy name, O Jehovah, God of hosts"; he learned his complete identification with Jehovah, God of hosts; it was such a wonderful identification.<a name=228:1></a> As illustration, when a woman marries, she takes her husband's name, she becomes called by his name; so Jeremiah was so wonderfully identified with Jehovah, God of hosts, that he says, "for I am called by thy name".<a name=228:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then you get the next effect of 'eating those words'.<a name=228:3></a> First, they discovered to him his complete identification with Jehovah, and thus they brought to light his privilege, as identified with that name, and they filled his heart with rejoicing.<a name=228:4></a> That was one side, but then the other side was his responsibility, and that which measured his privilege and his blessing on the one side, measured his responsibility on the other side.<a name=228:5></a> If being called by the name of Jehovah, God of hosts, was the full measure of his privilege, it became also the measure of his responsibility; he was responsible to stand apart from everything that dishonoured that name.<a name=228:6></a> So he says: "I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor exulted: I sat alone because of thy hand; for thou hast filled me with indignation".<a name=228:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, it was not because of the rejoicing that filled his heart in the discovery of his privilege, it was not on that side that he was reproached -- although, of course, these things cannot be

	<div class="paragraph">
		disconnected -- these two sides of the truth are never really apart.<a name=229:1></a> You may distinguish them, but you cannot separate them, for they go together.<a name=229:2></a> There is joy in the apprehension of privilege, but there is also the exercise connected with the apprehension of the side of responsibility, and, in a word, that is where you get into trial.<a name=229:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The devil does not care how happy you are; he is not concerned about your apprehension of privilege and your joy in the apprehension of it, but what the devil is opposed to is <i>separation</i>, and separation will get you into trouble.<a name=229:4></a> It always has got the people of God into trouble.<a name=229:5></a> That is nothing new; it could not be otherwise.<a name=229:6></a> I think, in a sense, that it was Abel's separation that got him into trouble with Cain.<a name=229:7></a> I think one might say, speaking reverently, it was so with the Lord.<a name=229:8></a> Oh!<a name=229:9></a> it was His intense separation that man could not bear.<a name=229:10></a> He was "holy, harmless, undefiled, separated from sinners" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#7:26">Hebrews  7:26</a>).<a name=229:11></a> That was <i>one</i> reason why He suffered as He did at the hands of men.<a name=229:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a wonderful testimony in separation, not in denunciation.<a name=229:13></a> Souls will get hardened under denunciation; you can easily get hard, and bitter, in connection with denunciation, but testimony is in separation, and as sure as we are marked by separation we shall be in the reproach that Jeremiah suffered from; and we know from the body of the book how he not only suffered reproach, but he suffered in every way from the hands of his enemies.<a name=229:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, what I want to come to is this: just as

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		there was a revival in the days of Jeremiah, so there has been a revival in our day, and, let me say, it is God who brings about a revival.<a name=230:1></a> God brings about revivals in the history of His people, and He brings them about for His own glory and for the blessing of His people.<a name=230:2></a> You always find, beloved, in a divine revival, that God ever has respect to that which He has established, to that which He has set up.<a name=230:3></a> There may be but a very few who are directly, personally, involved in the revival, but I am bold to say that in every revival God has in view, not only the maintenance of the testimony which He has established, but He has in view the blessing of His people.<a name=230:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, God has been pleased to bring about a revival in our day.<a name=230:5></a> He has been pleased to recover the truth for His own glory, and for the blessing, not simply of the few that may be immediately and personally concerned in connection with the revival, but God has in view the whole of His people.<a name=230:6></a> I wish we could think of that, because sometimes, it seems to me, we act as if we thought we were kind of favourites -- a few select ones -- and that God had some special interest in some few of us that He has not in all His people.<a name=230:7></a> Well there is the revival; but now the question is, What is <i>your</i> relationship and <i>mine</i> concerning it?<a name=230:8></a> God brings about a revival.<a name=230:9></a>

		Of course, these words of Jehovah could be, and no doubt were, taken in a literal way by Jeremiah -- all in perfect keeping with the character of that dispensation; but <i>we</i> must take them in a spiritual way, and let me say that, in the answer of Jehovah taken in that way, there is everything that the heart of the believer could desire.<a name=236:2></a> You can count on the Lord; you can count on His making you to stand; you can count upon Him for your spiritual protection and preservation, for your deliverance.<a name=236:3></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a great tendency with us to cling to what is earthly and natural, but it is good to see from the Scriptures that what is earthly and natural has never been the final thought before the mind of God.<a name=238:3></a> The earthly and the natural things were brought in in His ways as a testimony to heavenly and spiritual things.<a name=238:4></a> Not that there will not be blessing on the earth in a coming day, for there will; indeed, even in eternity there will be a new earth as well as a new heaven, as though God has indicated that He takes pleasure in different spheres and different degrees of blessing.<a name=238:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But that being so, it is well for us to understand that in the sovereignty of God and the love of God, we have been taken up for the very best.<a name=238:6></a> You may not be able to say why; that is a matter that lies in God's sovereignty.<a name=238:7></a> He works according to the good pleasure of His will, but there it is, that He has been pleased to choose us in Christ before the foundation of the world for the very best, for heavenly things and spiritual things, God Himself being a Spirit; that is, He intends to bring us into the closest affinity with Himself.<a name=238:8></a>

		Christ, having gone on high in virtue of accomplished redemption, has the right to give us by the Holy Spirit to enjoy His own love, and to understand that we are to share with Him as Man in a way that saints of no other dispensation will ever do.<a name=239:1></a> I say, that position having come about, Christ having gone on high and the Spirit having already come, you can understand that God wishes us to take an interest in heavenly and spiritual things, and that we should lay ourselves out to enter into them, and not allow ourselves to be detained by worldly things or even natural things.<a name=239:2></a>

		We often refer to Rebecca and how the question was put to her, "Wilt thou go with this man?<a name=239:3></a>" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24:58">Genesis  24:58</a>).<a name=239:4></a> The test with which Rebecca was faced was not whether she was going to be governed by what was worldly, but whether she was going to allow herself to be detained by what was legitimate in the natural sphere, her brother and her mother.<a name=239:5></a> That was the test with which she was faced, and when the question was raised with her, "Wilt thou go with this man?<a name=239:6></a>" ("this man" being a type of the Holy Spirit) she says, "I will go" (verse 58).<a name=239:7></a> The result was, that she became a comfort to Isaac's heart and was loved by him, all suggesting the possibilities that are open to us to become a comfort to Christ if we will yield ourselves to what is spiritual.<a name=239:8></a>

		The passage I read in 1 Corinthians emphasises this.<a name=239:9></a> It says, "The first man Adam became a living soul; the last Adam a quickening spirit".<a name=239:10></a> You can see how what is spiritual comes in, how immensely

		So it says here, "But that which is spiritual was not first, but that which is natural, then that which is spiritual", as though the Spirit of God through the apostle is urging upon us to take account of the fact that the change has now taken place; that there was that which was first, which was natural, but Christ having come in, and the Spirit having come, what was ever in God's mind has come in; and He is urging us to take account of the glory of it; and to take account of the fact that we ourselves have been called to have part in these wonderful things.<a name=240:8></a>

		The apostle goes on to say, "the first man out of the earth, made of dust"; it is a question of what he was constitutionally.<a name=240:9></a> If Adam had never sinned he would still have been earthy, but the second Man, "out of heaven"!<a name=240:10></a> What an immensely superior order of manhood has come in in Christ, a divine Person, bringing supreme moral excellence into manhood.<a name=240:11></a> Think of the grace of God that has in mind that we should partake of it!<a name=240:12></a> This is not something mystical, but something which has actually come in by virtue

		Well now, we can only enter upon what is spiritual, we can only take on the features of the One who is heavenly, in the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=241:5></a> God has given us the Holy Spirit in order that we might be able to take on what is spiritual, that we might find our life in what is spiritual and take on heavenly features.<a name=241:6></a> We were referring to the third chapter of John's gospel where we have the truth of new birth; that is, if there is to be anything for God, He must begin entirely anew.<a name=241:7></a> There must be a new moral being as a result of God's work, and the character of the new moral being is that it is spirit.<a name=241:8></a> "That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:6">John  3:6</a>), showing that the two are in absolute contrast.<a name=241:9></a> I think the Lord puts it that way so that we may understand that God is working now on the lines of what is spiritual.<a name=241:10></a>

		I would turn to Exodus now in order to show that God would use the exercises of the wilderness that we may realise the need for the Spirit; and to give us, if we may so say, a taste for the Spirit, that we may really lay ourselves out for that which is spiritual.<a name=241:11></a> I can assure the younger brethren that they will never regret it if they do so.<a name=241:12></a> In the living water, a

		We find that circumstances ordered of God for us are often exactly the opposite to those which we would have chosen; the waters are bitter.<a name=242:6></a> What is to be done?<a name=242:7></a> In what way are they to be made palatable?<a name=242:8></a> Moses cried unto Jehovah and Jehovah showed him wood.<a name=242:9></a> It is not properly a tree, but rather <i>wood</i>.<a name=242:10></a> When it was cast into the waters they became sweet.<a name=242:11></a> Wood in Scripture is usually a type of manhood, and here it refers to the character of manhood that was brought in in the Person of Jesus, and, I believe, that is just what alters the whole character of things.<a name=242:12></a>

		It is of great help, support and encouragement when we first begin to take account of the fact that the Lord Jesus in wonderful grace has entered into the circumstances of human life, and has been through them as governed in every way by the principles proper to a man in relation to God.<a name=242:13></a> That is to

		The carpenter's shop at Nazareth was not what men might regard as the most desirable of circumstances, but these circumstances were the will of God for Him, and He accepted them and filled them out in a glorious way on the principle of obedience.<a name=243:2></a> Everything the Father ordered for Him was pleasing to Him.<a name=243:3></a> His Father had been pleased to hide things from the wise and prudent and reveal them unto babes, and He said, "yea, Father; for thus has it been well-pleasing in thy sight" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10:21">Luke  10:21</a>).<a name=243:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It alters the whole aspect of things in regard of that which may be contrary to our natural tastes if we begin to see that, in the Person of Jesus, God has introduced the principle of obedience as that which is to govern His people in every circumstance.<a name=243:5></a> We find wonderful rest of mind and heart and spirit once that is accepted.<a name=243:6></a> The waters take on an attraction that the Spirit of God gives them.<a name=243:7></a> Nothing spiritual will, of course, ever be attractive to the natural man, but to the renewed mind everything of God becomes attractive.<a name=243:8></a> The first governing principle in a Christian's life is obedience to the will of God in everything.<a name=243:9></a> Marah indicates that.<a name=243:10></a> It was there that God said, "If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of

		Well now, having said so much as to its relation with Israel, I want to show how it is connected with the assembly which is the glory of Christ, and in speaking of the assembly, as I said at the beginning, we are speaking of ourselves.<a name=285:2></a> Now glory is first of all a question of subjection to Christ.<a name=285:3></a> The woman is said to be the glory of the man (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:7">1 Corinthians  11:7</a>), and on that account she is to have a mark of subjection (verse 10).<a name=285:4></a>

		Dear brethren, may I ask where we are in regard of subjection to Christ?<a name=285:5></a> The assembly is subjected to Christ; God has placed her in that position.<a name=285:6></a> The man was not "created for the sake of the woman, but the woman for the sake of the man" (verse 9).<a name=285:7></a> The assembly was made for Christ.<a name=285:8></a> Do I know that in my soul; that I am set here in subjection to Christ in relation to all the saints?<a name=285:9></a> The assembly is subjected to Christ; that is her place, and to move away from that place is to be lawless, for that is the place in which God has set her.<a name=285:10></a> That is the first principle of the assembly's position.<a name=285:11></a> How is she to be held there?<a name=285:12></a> The Lord nourishes and cherishes her; that is His side (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:29">Ephesians  5:29</a>), for she is to be held there through her affections.<a name=285:13></a> Hence, the Lord's supper is the full expression of the love of Christ for the assembly: "This is my body, which is given for you" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22:19">Luke  22:19</a>); it is His devoted love for the assembly.<a name=285:14></a> He has given Himself for her, and in the Supper He sets before us in a continuous way a testimony to that unchanging

		The next chapter only too sorrowfully details how she lent her ear to the tempter; exactly what the apostle feared in regard of the Corinthians, in regard of the whole assembly.<a name=286:10></a> He says, "But I fear lest by any means, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craft, so your thoughts should be corrupted from simplicity as to the Christ" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#11:3">2 Corinthians  11:3</a>).<a name=286:11></a> Eve lent her ear to the tempter, and left her place.<a name=286:12></a> As in her place she was Adam's glory, but she left it, and the result was that Adam's glory was gone.<a name=286:13></a>

		The assemblies of which the apostle speaks, in this second letter to the Corinthians, were in accord with Christ; that is why I read the passage.<a name=287:5></a> Certain needs existed elsewhere, and the saints were moved by the love of Christ to render help.<a name=287:6></a> They sent money by the hands of certain brothers, and the apostle said, If any inquire about these brothers they are "messengers of assemblies, Christ's glory"; that shows that the principle of giving, which is the outcome of love, can be taken account of as the glory of Christ.<a name=287:7></a> The assembly, as set here in His absence, was intended to reflect what He was; and so the apostle said to the Ephesian elders, "remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20:35">Acts  20:35</a>).<a name=287:8></a> Giving is the reflection of Christ; that is to say, the exercise of love towards one another is the reflection and the glory of Christ.<a name=287:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15">Luke  15</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not want to give an address this afternoon but just to talk to you quite informally about the love of God.<a name=297:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the beginning of Luke's gospel we learn who the Lord Jesus Christ was as <i>Man</i>.<a name=297:2></a> He was the Son of God (chapter 1: 35).<a name=297:3></a> If you want to learn who He is as a divine Person you must go to John's gospel; <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:18">John  1:18</a> brings out that truth.<a name=297:4></a> But in Luke we learn who He is as Man.<a name=297:5></a> The Angel Gabriel said to Mary, "the holy thing also which shall be born shall be called Son of God".<a name=297:6></a> So when He was born, God immediately owns Him in this peculiar way -- "<i>Thou</i> art my Son: this day have <i>I</i> begotten thee" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1">Hebrews  1</a> 5).<a name=297:7></a> Now what marked Him as Man was this -- He was the Son of God.<a name=297:8></a> When He was baptised God opened the heavens and said, "This is my beloved Son" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#3:17">Matthew  3:17</a>), showing that the Lord Jesus Christ was the peculiar Object of the love of God, and He adds -- "in whom I have found my delight", showing that there is in Him as Man a perfect answer to God's love.<a name=297:9></a> How these two things mark Him!<a name=297:10></a> If you give your heart to anyone, nothing would satisfy you but that they should answer to that love.<a name=297:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I want to bring before you is the Lord Jesus Christ as Man.<a name=297:12></a> Nothing was lacking in God's delight in Him; all His affection was concentrated on that Man, to whom He says: "<i>Thou</i> art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#3:22">Luke  3:22</a>).<a name=297:13></a> But
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=298>[Page 298]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		more than that, God found in that Man a perfect response to His love.<a name=298:1></a> I wish I could express what that must have been to God.<a name=298:2></a> He created man in perfect innocence; man was an innocent creature and there was probably delightful intercourse between God and Adam.<a name=298:3></a> God walked in the garden, but then sin came in, and God lost all pleasure in that man and had to drive him out of the garden, and put a flaming sword at the gate of Paradise (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#3">Genesis  3</a>).<a name=298:4></a> About one thousand six hundred years ran on until you come to <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#6">Genesis  6</a>, and "Jehovah repented that he had made Man on the earth", we are told, and "it grieved him in his heart" (verse 6).<a name=298:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then later we get the children of Israel: God separated them for Himself, and gave them the law and said, "thou shalt love Jehovah thy God with all thy heart" (<a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#6:5">Deuteronomy  6:5</a>).<a name=298:6></a> Was there any response in man?<a name=298:7></a> Before Moses came down from the mount (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#32">Exodus  32</a>), man had set up an idol.<a name=298:8></a> Fallen man has never responded to God, he was only a disappointment to Him.<a name=298:9></a> God had set His heart on man but He got no response from him.<a name=298:10></a> But the Son of God came here into Manhood and God could look down on <i>Him</i> and say -- <i>There</i> is not only a Man on whom I can concentrate all My love, but there is One who answers perfectly to My love.<a name=298:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, what is the point of Christianity?<a name=298:12></a> Why, to make you and me like that Man -- like the Son of God.<a name=298:13></a> In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:29">Romans  8:29</a> we are told that we are "predestinated to be conformed to the image of his Son".<a name=298:14></a> God has got that before Him; that is what

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=299>[Page 299]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christianity means, and what the gospel means -- that you and I should be like the Son of God, so that we might know and enjoy God's love and answer to it.<a name=299:1></a> The great point of <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15">Luke  15</a>is that the Lord Jesus, who was the peculiar Object of the heart of God -- the One who knew that love and was answering to it as no one else could -- that <i>He tells out</i> the heart of God.<a name=299:2></a> There is only one thing worth your while, or worth mine, only one thing worth knowing, and that is the <i>heart</i> of God -- to know God's love, and that He can fill your heart and mine.<a name=299:3></a> We like the sunshine and rejoice in it, but, beloved, what is it to have your heart lit up with the eternal sunshine of the love of God, and to have your heart responsive to that love?<a name=299:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Issues are being raised now as to what we believe doctrinally; these questions are but as dust, the great thing is -- do you by the Spirit <i>know</i> that God is love?<a name=299:5></a> Has the sunshine of that love entered your heart?<a name=299:6></a> John, in his first epistle, says, "<i>we</i> have known and have believed the love which God has to us" (chapter 4: 16); that is the point, for as you know it and believe it, your heart answers to it, and we love Him because He first loved us (verse 19).<a name=299:7></a> Could anything be more simple?<a name=299:8></a> We all know how everything changes here, how disappointments and sorrows come in, but at all times there is the love of God, and that love is brighter than the sun, The sun will set tonight, but God's love has no sunset, no clouds or interruptions; there it is like eternal sunshine, it shines and shines on for ever.<a name=299:9></a>

		In <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15">Luke  15</a>we get really one parable in three parts, but all three are distinct; the shepherd is distinct from the father, but the shepherd is God the Son, the woman is God the Spirit, the father is God the Father -- there is distinction on the one hand but marvellous blending on the other.<a name=300:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And all is to bring out the heart of God!<a name=300:2></a> The Son of God came down here to express before man all that was in the heart of God; now He has died, has been raised from the dead, exalted and glorified.<a name=300:3></a> All the light of that love, and response to that love, has been left in this world, and now from Christ exalted the Spirit has come down and "the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:5">Romans  5:5</a>).<a name=300:4></a> That is to say, the Spirit has come to make good in your heart and in mine the very love that rested on Him as Son of God and to which He perfectly responded; the Holy Spirit has come to shed abroad that very love so that the eternal sunshine of it should light up our hearts to produce the same kind of response to it that there was in His heart.<a name=300:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What was the response?<a name=300:6></a> Look at Him in that dark moment in Gethsemane; the agony of His soul was so great that His sweat was as drops of blood (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22:44">Luke  22:44</a>) .<a name=300:7></a> What did He say?<a name=300:8></a> "Abba, Father" (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#14:36">Mark  14:36</a>).<a name=300:9></a> In the heart of that blessed Man in that dark moment there was perfect response to the love of God.<a name=300:10></a> God takes us up and makes us sons.<a name=300:11></a> He has "sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:6">Galatians  4:6</a>), that is, producing in our hearts the same response to Himself that was in the

	<div class="paragraph">
		heart of Jesus, the Son of God.<a name=301:1></a> That is Christianity; and I assure you that nothing is worth your thought or mine but that your heart and mine should know the same love that He knew as Man here -- that that same love should fill your heart and mine with eternal sunshine and that there should be produced in your heart the same response as there was from His -- that "Abba, Father", the utterance of responsive affection should be begotten in your heart by faith and in the knowledge of the love of God.<a name=301:2></a> It does not mean that you will not have trials and sorrows here.<a name=301:3></a> If it is a question of trials He is the pattern Man.<a name=301:4></a> Do not imagine that you will not have trials; it is guaranteed to us by the Lord, for He says: "In the world ye have tribulation" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#16:33">John  16:33</a>), and strangely enough, tribulation is what we are so afraid of.<a name=301:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But what does scripture say?<a name=301:6></a> "We also boast in tribulations, knowing that tribulation works endurance; and endurance, experience" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:3">Romans  5:3</a>, 4).<a name=301:7></a> Do you not want experience?<a name=301:8></a> Do you know what is the matter with people when they go about with sad faces and are full of complaints?<a name=301:9></a> They do not know the love of God; the divine remedy for sorrow is knowing the love of God, bowing to the will of the One who so loves me.<a name=301:10></a> If you knew His love you would be like one who in a dark, damp cell in prison wrote --
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I am longing to tell you what the love of God means; it means all that is <i>good</i>, it means peace -- peace from the moment you wake to the moment you sleep -- it means joy, it means everything that can be put into the word <i>blessedness</i>.<a name=302:1></a> I wish I could tell you how to know that love and to have your heart answering to it.<a name=302:2></a> I once went to California, and a brother said to me, 'Just think, we have three hundred and twenty cloudless days here every year'!<a name=302:3></a> I replied, 'I can beat <i>that</i> by forty-five; I have three hundred and sixty-five cloudless days'.<a name=302:4></a> Is that in my circumstances -- in my responsible life?<a name=302:5></a> Oh!<a name=302:6></a> no; but in my spiritual relation to God there is not a single cloud.<a name=302:7></a> "<i>We</i> have known and have believed the love which God has to us".<a name=302:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Spirit has shed abroad His love in my heart, and has produced an answer to it.<a name=302:9></a> <i>That</i> is sunshine, peace and rest.<a name=302:10></a> The love of God will take away all the worry, and fret, and every evil desire from your heart; it will just clear it out, such things cannot stand in the sunshine of God's love.<a name=302:11></a> Why do people worry and fret about their circumstances?<a name=302:12></a> If you had asked Madame Guyon (1648 - 1717) if she wanted to get out of prison, she would answer --

THE BELIEVER BUILDS<br>In the next chapter of Genesis, chapter 12, we find the believer building.<a name=317:3></a> In Babel there was no altar, no approach to God, or the feeling of need for it.<a name=317:4></a> But when Abram is called out he feels the need of an altar and he first builds at Moreh, then at Bethel (chapter 12: 7, 8).<a name=317:5></a> He has a knowledge of the spiritual geography of the place, for it says he had "Bethel toward the west, and Ai toward the east".<a name=317:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is remarkable, for Bethel means 'the house of God' and Ai means 'heaps'.<a name=317:7></a> As the sun rose, its rays fell on Ai, suggesting the confusion of this world, but at the altar, speaking of the precious sacrifice of Christ, all the confusion is met and dealt with to God's glory.<a name=317:8></a> So that leads to Bethel ('the house of God'), the great terminus of all the ways of God, and all the light of God as to Christ finds its rest there.<a name=317:9></a>

		4. BUILDING IN DANGEROUS TIMES<br>Now, in Nehemiah the prophet we read that, though the times were dangerous, as they are today, still the people of God went on building.<a name=318:4></a> How often when difficulties confront us, or when local gatherings of the people of God have troubles, the building up of one another seems to be in abeyance.<a name=318:5></a> But in Nehemiah they carried with one hand good building material and with the other hand a weapon (chapter 4: 17), to defend what they were doing, themselves, and others.<a name=318:6></a> But we read that those who builded on the wall must use their two hands, and their swords were strapped on their sides (verse 18).<a name=318:7></a> Does not this indicate that we need both our hands for building?<a name=318:8></a> It is so important and requires all our skill, and that skill moved by a heart for the Lord, for it says, "Love edifies", or builds up, (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#8:1">1 Corinthians  8:1</a>).<a name=318:9></a>

		We see that, in a situation where there was a difficulty, Paul writes this beautiful letter to his brother Philemon.<a name=321:1></a> It is good that we have this epistle to Philemon, for it lets us into the secrets of Paul's affections in a very remarkable way.<a name=321:2></a> The subject of it was Onesimus, who had run away from his master, and somehow had met Paul and been converted.<a name=321:3></a> "Whom I have begotten in my bonds" -- what a cheer to Paul!<a name=321:4></a> Paul is a fruitful man; even in his bonds he is fruitful.<a name=321:5></a> Now he is sending Onesimus back to Philemon.<a name=321:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There must have been a very remarkable work of God in Onesimus in a very short time, and this should encourage the younger brethren.<a name=321:7></a> Onesimus is not an old brother, he is a young convert; but Paul says about him, "do <i>thou</i> receive him, that is, <i>my</i> bowels".<a name=321:8></a> We have Paul, and the reproduction of Paul in his child, "<i>my</i> child".<a name=321:9></a> Would you not like to be one of Paul's children?<a name=321:10></a> Are you like your father?<a name=321:11></a> You look at a child and you say, He is like his father, or, He is like his mother.<a name=321:12></a> Paul begets children, and that lineage continues to this day.<a name=321:13></a> Onesimus was such, and what marked him, apparently, even as young in the testimony, was that there was reproduced in him Paul's own feelings and affections.<a name=321:14></a> Therefore let love develop in you in your youth.<a name=321:15></a> The germ of all those things comes into your soul

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there is the brother Philemon, who is Onesimus' master; but now there is a double relationship, for while he is still Onesimus' master, he is also his brother in Christ.<a name=322:6></a> That is interesting, and all these things involve a readjustment.<a name=322:7></a> It does not mean that Onesimus will talk disrespectfully to his master -- let nobody do that!<a name=322:8></a> You learn to be subject to your temporal master.<a name=322:9></a> Onesimus' temporal master was a brother, and some today work for their brethren.<a name=322:10></a> Paul says to Timothy that those who have believing masters should serve them readily, knowing that they "profit by the good and ready service rendered" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#6:2">1 Timothy  6:2</a>).<a name=322:11></a> That is the way Christianity works; you are thinking of what your brother will get out of it as well as yourself.<a name=322:12></a> If you are a master, you will think of the servant; you will think of your brother in that connection too.<a name=322:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul shows how these relationships are to be worked out, but the background to it all is in the holy feelings in Paul, Onesimus and Philemon.<a name=323:9></a> Paul is counting on them.<a name=323:10></a> Philemon was a good brother, and these deep-seated affections and longings after Christ and after the truth are in the saints.<a name=323:11></a> Paul speaks about the bowels of the saints to Philemon: "the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother".<a name=323:12></a> We speak about feet-washing, but here it is refreshing the bowels of the saints.<a name=323:13></a> Would it not be a good thing, if, as a result of this meeting, the inward affections of the saints were refreshed, that as affected by the word of the Lord, our longings and desires for one another might be freshly stimulated?<a name=323:14></a> The Lord would do that at a time like this.<a name=323:15></a> The brotherly relationship has to be worked out "by thee, brother".<a name=323:16></a>

		Philemon had an assembly in his house (verse 2) and so he was able to help the brethren, and it was not only that they came in and had the meetings in a formal way and went out, but I would think you would feel that, as you came into Philemon's house, there was something refreshing about it all; your affections would be moved, your inwards would be moved.<a name=324:7></a> What a thing that would be amongst us!<a name=324:8></a> The Lord would encourage us in these things, that what is substantial and what will abide may be increased.<a name=324:9></a>

		So, dear brethren, there is much to go on with to fill out the night.<a name=341:4></a> It is very wonderful to think that the Lord has chosen this simple yet powerful way of our occupying the night time.<a name=341:5></a> He has appointed this simple way of His own Supper so that He might have His own here wholly occupied with Himself.<a name=341:6></a> The psalmist says, "I will wake the dawn" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#57">Psalm  57</a> 8).<a name=341:7></a> That is, typically, he is a man who is in the light of another day in which Christ shines in all His splendour.<a name=341:8></a> It is a marvellous beginning, and a marvellous characteristic of the saints during the night.<a name=341:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would like in passing to say a word about the literal night, that it might not be altogether lost by us.<a name=341:10></a> Some stay up late literally in conversation amongst the brethren, and the Lord helps; I do not think He would help if we were merely following physical pleasures, but He helps in speaking about the truth.<a name=341:11></a> Sometimes the Lord allows us to have sleepless nights.<a name=341:12></a> The Lord is prepared to fill those out too.<a name=341:13></a> One could say, "even in the nights my reins instruct me" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16:7">Psalm  16:7</a>) -- the reins, the great organs of the body which serve for discrimination of what is good and pure, and the refusal of what is injurious and poisonous.<a name=341:14></a> It is remarkable that David should use that expression, saying that his reins instructed

		him in the night season.<a name=342:1></a> Perhaps we may not find time or make time for the discriminating of things in the day time and the Lord therefore gets an entrance then.<a name=342:2></a> If He does it is a good thing.<a name=342:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Without thinking of this matter in a purely human way relative to the Lord, it is marvellous to think where He spent His nights, on the mount of Olives, a great spiritual realm in touch with heaven: "And by day", it says, "he was teaching in the temple, and by night, going out, he remained abroad on the mountain called the mount of Olives" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#21">Luke  21</a> 37); that is, He was free, not confined to one particular thought, but ranging abroad on the mount of Olives during the night season.<a name=342:4></a> How suggestive these things are for us, and even if we just catch the spirit of one of them how good it would be if we were with the Lord in that matter.<a name=342:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I come back to these scriptures, which are typical; that is, they help us to fill out the moral night, and I start with Leviticus for this is a word for the priests.<a name=342:6></a> It is something which affects us where we are most interested at the present time, namely, the service of God.<a name=342:7></a> It is a word through Moses to Aaron and his sons about the altar.<a name=342:8></a> The fire on the altar was never to go out, <i>never</i>.<a name=342:9></a> "This is the law of the burnt-offering; this, the burnt-offering, shall be on the hearth on the altar all night unto the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be kept burning on it".<a name=342:10></a> Let us think, dear brethren, what it is for God <i>now</i> to find something going up, not as of old, from the brazen altar in the court of the tabernacle system, but
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=343>[Page 343]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		something going up from the ready altars of the hearts of the saints.<a name=343:1></a> Christ is there and the offering is going up so that God has before Him the burning of it -- really, we might say the incense of it -- at all times from night until morning.<a name=343:2></a> I am speaking of our occupation from now onwards until the Lord comes, that there should always be something readily going up from our hearts which reminds God of Christ.<a name=343:3></a> It is a peculiar offering, the burnt-offering, in that the burning of it was just like incense, not burned to be eaten, not burned to be consumed, but burned like incense.<a name=343:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The instructions of the priests go further.<a name=343:5></a> It tells us in verse 12 that "the fire upon the altar shall be kept burning on it; it shall not be put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay the burnt-offering in order upon it", and so on, and then later, "A continual fire shall ever be kept burning on the altar: it shall never go out".<a name=343:6></a> There is something by which the fire is kept going, and that is the wood.<a name=343:7></a> Thus we have the fire, and then the wood, and then the offering, the offering in its pieces.<a name=343:8></a> I would say that that gives us the secret.<a name=343:9></a> It tells us that as we take up holy thoughts of the manhood of Christ as found in the gospels, and occupy our minds with them, we shall find that there are readily combustible materials in the affections of the saints for offering something of Christ to God.<a name=343:10></a> Let us take note of the wood.<a name=343:11></a>

		Let us not be vague in our thoughts, dear brethren.<a name=344:8></a> Let us fasten on something definite, something connected with the humanity of Christ.<a name=344:9></a> Let us think of His touch upon some soul -- the woman at Sychar (<a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>), the woman in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>.<a name=344:10></a> How He went about, the Anointed of God, doing good, healing all that were oppressed of the devil.<a name=344:11></a> Let us think about Himself, His hands, His feet, His side, and His mind; the mind of Christ.<a name=344:12></a> Let these things occupy us.<a name=344:13></a> One of these days, you see, we shall be ushered into a realm where there is nothing else to occupy us but Christ.<a name=344:14></a> It will be Christ "everything, and in all" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3:11">Colossians  3:11</a>).<a name=344:15></a> Now is the time by way of the fire and the wood to begin in the great general service of God.<a name=344:16></a>

		But note the Churches were to do this, so they are responsible for it, and so, connected with this point, though they may have an independent higher calling -- analogously, the disciples cast out devils according to the power of Christ's name upon earth, yet they were to rejoice rather that their names were written in heaven (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10:19">Luke  10:19</a>, 20).<a name=352:3></a> Now it was by the Holy Spirit as to power, no doubt, but still it was not as heavenly calling but the title of Christ in blessing to bless on the earth -- to set aside earthly judgment on account of sin -- this was an accessory portion of the Church, though important to its place of testimony to Christ on the earth, for His title was to it, and He has power for it.<a name=352:4></a>

		The week is very interesting, especially in view of the place it holds in Scripture.<a name=354:3></a> Christianity began, as you might say, with the first day of the week, for we may date it from the first day of the week.<a name=354:4></a> The Holy Spirit did not descend until fifty days after, but the new thing began in Christ arising and entering into the assembly, or the company of His own, in the upper room at Jerusalem; and, following upon that, on the next first day of the week He came again (<a href="../bible/John.htm#20:19">John  20:19</a>, 26).<a name=354:5></a> In that way, He inaugurated what may be called a weekly period.<a name=354:6></a> In other words, <i>assembly</i> life, as one may say, is composed of weeks; the Lord having indicated this, not by commandment but by <i>precedent</i>.<a name=354:7></a> Christianity is much more established by precedent than by precept, although we have precepts, commandments, and ordinances in Christianity, each of which is obligatory in its place; but the precedents established by the Lord Jesus acquire a peculiar place in the minds of those who love Him.<a name=354:8></a>

		It was not only <i>what</i> He did, but <i>how</i> He did it: not only <i>what</i> He said, but <i>how</i> He said it.<a name=354:9></a> All these things enter into the experience of a lover of Christ, and the disciples were lovers of Christ at the beginning.<a name=354:10></a> They all loved Him and they had

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the precedents I refer to are those which the Lord set after He arose.<a name=355:3></a> Indeed the facts attending His resurrection are recorded so as to produce certain impressions.<a name=355:4></a> There was a total disregard of human restrictions and limitations.<a name=355:5></a> The stone was rolled away but that was not necessary for Christ to come out.<a name=355:6></a> He had come out before and everything in the tomb was in order; there was no evidence of a struggle.<a name=355:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And, being out of the tomb, He is not seen by the public eye, but He appears to Mary in the garden.<a name=355:8></a> She thought He was the gardener, but He says, "Mary" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#20:15">John  20:15</a>, 16).<a name=355:9></a> What an impression that must have made on her mind!<a name=355:10></a> If the Lord were to call one of us by name, you can understand that a lasting impression would remain.<a name=355:11></a> I believe He will pronounce all of our names.<a name=355:12></a> He calls Mary by name.<a name=355:13></a> He intended to produce an impression on her, and then He sends her with a message to the brethren, to <i>His</i> brethren, by which He intended to produce an impression on them, and now He appears in their midst, <i>the doors being shut</i>, and He says, "Peace be to you" (verse 19).<a name=355:14></a> He <i>stood</i> in the midst.<a name=355:15></a> It does not say that He sat down.<a name=355:16></a> The present is a provisional period, and so the Lord <i>stood</i> in the midst; but in

	<div class="paragraph">
		All that, and much more that I cannot mention now, was intended to produce an impression that should remain, so that Christianity should be a reality in this world, a spiritual institution with the impress of Christ on it; and so He established the principle, or practice, of weekly visitations to His own.<a name=356:2></a> Do you not, therefore, readily perceive how a lover of Christ at the beginning would regard his history, viewed in relation to the assembly, as a weekly one?<a name=356:3></a> I can well understand it.<a name=356:4></a> I can understand Peter or John saying, The Lord came the first day of last week, and He came another first day.<a name=356:5></a> It was not necessary that every visitation should be recorded.<a name=356:6></a> We have the principle established that they were <i>weekly</i>; not that one would limit the Lord, for He is sovereign, but He did establish that precedent.<a name=356:7></a> Hence, dear brethren, the assembly's history, as in time, I apprehend is, in this respect, made up of weeks.<a name=356:8></a>

		People speak about the humdrum life of Christians, the sameness of it … If I take up an English Episcopalian prayer book, I find that the scripture enjoined to be read on a given Sunday in 1620 is that which is to be read on the same Sunday of 1920.<a name=357:3></a> Is that not sameness?<a name=357:4></a> What were the manifestations of Christ during all these Sundays?<a name=357:5></a> What are they to the worshipper, so-called, who uses that volume as his medium of worship?<a name=357:6></a> He has lost the great feature of Christianity, the manifestations of Christ to His own.<a name=357:7></a> <i>We</i> do not want to miss these, beloved brethren.<a name=357:8></a> We get them in their blessed varieties in the beginnings of our weeks.<a name=357:9></a> Let us not for a moment entertain that the Lord is inactive; He is not inactive.<a name=357:10></a> He can come to His own and make Himself known afresh week by week.<a name=357:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#37">Genesis  37</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		No part of the Bible probably has so fastened itself upon the imagination of the young as the history of Joseph; many would account it almost the most interesting part of Scripture.<a name=369:2></a> But I do not believe that the history of Joseph was given to us as an interesting story, but because Joseph serves to set forth the truth concerning Christ; he comes before us as a figure of Christ as connected with Israel.<a name=369:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now it is in that way that I take up his history, not at all with the idea of expatiating on the history, save as in some way presenting to us the truth as to Christ.<a name=369:4></a> And I am justified in using the history in this way, from the allusion made to Joseph by Stephen in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7">Acts  7</a>; the latter there shows that those raised up of God for the deliverance of His people had always been first rejected, whoever it might be -- Joseph, or Moses, or even Christ.<a name=369:5></a> This was just the perversity of the people against the sovereignty of God.<a name=369:6></a> That is the principle against which man constantly rebels, and such rebellion is the spring and source of infidelity in the present day.<a name=369:7></a> I think that it is intelligible, that if man has a will of his own, he is pretty certain to rebel against a will stronger than his.<a name=369:8></a> It is not only that God has a will, but God's will is sovereign, and God will work out His own will; and it is against the sovereignty of God's will that man kicks.<a name=369:9></a>

		before the deliverance came.<a name=370:1></a> It is in that sense I take up a few incidents in the history of Joseph in our particular chapter, bearing in mind that the history is a setting forth, figuratively, of what comes out in <i>Christ</i>, almost in every part of it, though I could not say in every detail.<a name=370:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in Israel the birthright is connected with Joseph.<a name=370:3></a> Birthright is looked at in Scripture as a privilege from God, and in old times it was customary to attach a good deal of importance to birthright.<a name=370:4></a> Esau despised his birthright, and though afterwards he sought the blessing earnestly with tears, he found no place for repentance (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:16">Hebrews  12:16</a>, 17).<a name=370:5></a> As I said, the birthright in Israel is connected with Joseph, though lineally Christ was descended from Judah; the genealogy is Judah's.<a name=370:6></a> We do not find in Scripture Judah ever looked at as a type of Christ; on the other hand, Joseph is a striking type of Christ, and it is the more interesting because of the birthright being connected with Joseph.<a name=370:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It will not be very difficult hereafter for Israel to trace their genealogy, for they will trace it through Christ, and in <i>Christ</i> the birthright of Israel is secured.<a name=370:8></a> When Christ was born into this world He was the security to Israel of their birthright, and He had a due sense of the importance of the birthright of Israel, of what pertained to them according to God.<a name=370:9></a> But we see how the Jews despised their birthright; they said, "We have no king but Caesar" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#19:15">John  19:15</a>); but the birthright is maintained for them in <i>Christ</i>.<a name=370:10></a>

		of Joseph, a testimony which excited the dislike and envy of his brethren; the more he testified, the greater was the dislike, until at last it became boundless.<a name=371:1></a> What Joseph bore testimony to, as I understand it, was the <i>sovereignty of God</i>; that was the point of his testimony.<a name=371:2></a> It was not a question of himself, but God had communicated His mind to him in dreams; and what God had communicated to him was the burden of his testimony; it expressed the sovereign will of God.<a name=371:3></a> His father, his mother, and his brethren were all to do obeisance to him.<a name=371:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This was the sovereign will of God.<a name=371:5></a> And man's will rebels against it, but God will do according to His own good will and pleasure.<a name=371:6></a> Christ in coming into the world says, "Lo, I come … to do, O God, <i>thy will</i>" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:7">Hebrews  10:7</a>); and He taught His disciples to pray, "thy will be done as in heaven so upon the earth" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#6:10">Matthew  6:10</a>).<a name=371:7></a> The will of God is to rule.<a name=371:8></a> The testimony of Joseph is remarkable; but I want to pass on to the testimony of the great antitype, Christ Himself, and would also like to say a word with regard to the church.<a name=371:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It appears to me that before God gives exaltation He gives the <i>testimony</i> of exaltation.<a name=371:10></a> I see that principle running through Scripture.<a name=371:11></a> God does nothing until He has first given a testimony of it.<a name=371:12></a> He exalts whom He will, but before the exaltation is the testimony.<a name=371:13></a> That is seen here in regard to Joseph.<a name=371:14></a> Even the sun and the moon and the eleven stars were to do obeisance to him, but Joseph has first to be the vessel of God's testimony.<a name=371:15></a> It is not, I am sure, a

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God knew that they were to go down into Egypt, and Joseph was raised up of God for the preservation of his kindred.<a name=372:7></a> Joseph had to bear testimony to what was in the mind of God, but I do not think that Joseph was himself yet morally suitable for the exaltation.<a name=372:8></a> But anyway Joseph had no part in the evil doings of his brethren.<a name=372:9></a> He was separate from them, and could bear testimony against them, because he was not partaker of their evil deeds.<a name=372:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Christ, when here, bore witness to the sovereign will of God.<a name=372:11></a> He bore witness, too, to the grace of God and to the condition of the people; but the great point in His testimony was the sovereign will of God, and, in connection with it, His own exaltation.<a name=372:12></a> I refer to an instance: in the parable of the marriage supper He says, "a king who made a wedding feast for <i>his son</i>" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#22:2">Matthew  22:2</a>).<a name=372:13></a> The marriage was for the king's son.<a name=372:14></a> Then He told His disciples continually what would happen to Himself; He bore witness, too, to the place He would have at the right hand of God.<a name=372:15></a> He witnessed a good confession.<a name=372:16></a> The people were running after evil deeds, but Christ bore

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think we can see that from <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16:11">Psalm  16:11</a> (A.<a name=373:7></a>V.<a name=373:8></a>), "in thy presence is fulness of joy".<a name=373:9></a> He could not find that down here.<a name=373:10></a> He might say, "The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage" (verse 6); but it is "in <i>thy</i> presence is fulness of joy".<a name=373:11></a> It is interesting to contrast in that psalm what the Lord could enter into down here, and what He looked for at the right hand of God.<a name=373:12></a> But, whether one or the other, there was moral suitability.<a name=373:13></a> Christ is in the highest place of exaltation as Man, and is perfectly at home there; He came from there, and He is gone back there, and He bore witness to this continually while down here.<a name=373:14></a> "The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#20:42">Luke  20:42</a>, 43).<a name=373:15></a> The Lord bore witness to that.<a name=373:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I pass on now to speak of the church.<a name=373:17></a> The church is in the place of Christ's rejection, but is going to share His exaltation.<a name=373:18></a> That is the purpose of God in regard to the church, and it is left down here in testimony to that.<a name=373:19></a> The proper testimony of the church is that it does not belong to this scene at all, but to <i>heaven</i>.<a name=373:20></a> But such testimony comes out very much more in what people <i>are</i> than in what they say, and the church has been left here that, in the power of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I cannot say why God should have seen fit to give that place to the church, but it is given in the sovereignty of His will.<a name=374:5></a> Now we are in the light of that -- made to sit in the heavenly places for His pleasure.<a name=374:6></a> But while that is so, we are left down here to be in <i>moral suitability</i> to it.<a name=374:7></a> We give no place to the enemy, but stand apart from the influences of the god of this world; we put on the "panoply of God" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#6:11">Ephesians  6:11</a>), and withstand; we do not give in an inch to anything here, but stand in the truth of the sovereignty of God's will.<a name=374:8></a> That is a difficult thing to do today.<a name=374:9></a> If Scripture were simply a book of ethics there would not be antagonism to it, but because it expresses the will of God -- and man hates the idea of the sovereignty of God's will -- there is the effort to set aside the testimony of Scripture.<a name=374:10></a>
