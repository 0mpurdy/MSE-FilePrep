		I desire to refer to this incident of the Lord riding into Jerusalem, in connection with the way that it is presented in these three gospels.<a name=1:2></a> It is referred to in John's gospel also, where it is said that the Lord, when He had found the ass, sat thereon (chapter 12: 14).<a name=1:3></a> We do not get great detail in that gospel, nor do we get the commission of the two disciples to bring the ass; but the incident is mentioned.<a name=1:4></a> It is one of the few incidents that are mentioned in all four gospels, so that evidently a special importance attaches to it; but in the first three gospels we find that the Lord indicates that He had need of the colt.<a name=1:5></a> The Lord had need of <i>them</i> in Matthew, and the Lord had need of <i>it</i> in Mark and Luke, and one would desire to impress upon every believer (for there is no doubt that the colt is a picture of the believer) that the Lord has need of every one of His own in connection with the testimony in this world.<a name=1:6></a>

		One would like to convey the sense that the Lord has <i>need of each one of us</i>, in view of a definite purpose, that we should be wholly at His disposal in connection with the testimony of His name in some particular aspect in this world from which He has been cast out.<a name=1:7></a> The Lord was about to ride into Jerusalem with the full knowledge that He would be crucified; the position was well known to the Lord; He had often spoken of it to His disciples, and if we as in the world become increasingly conscious of the

		rejection of Christ, as Scripture says, "cast away as worthless" by men (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:7">1 Peter  2:7</a>), we may rest assured that the position is well known to the Lord.<a name=2:1></a> He has known about it, and taken account of it from the very outset.<a name=2:2></a> The Lord has need of me!<a name=2:3></a> In the spiritual history of each one of us it was the other way round first -- <i>we</i> had need of the Lord, but there comes a moment when the Lord would impress upon us that He has need of us.<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Matthew's gospel, what is in view, in connection with the Lord having need of His people, is the truth of the assembly (the church of God), for Matthew's gospel presents that; it is the gospel that supports the apostle Paul's ministry in connection with the truth of the assembly, and it is a great thing to get the sense that the Lord has need of us in a living way, in connection with that which He calls "my assembly" (chapter 16: 18).<a name=2:5></a> "On this rock", He said to Peter, "I will build my assembly, and hades' gates shall not prevail against it".<a name=2:6></a> That is to say, the Lord has, down here, in the presence of the concentrated forces of evil and opposition to the truth, that which He speaks of as "my assembly", that which will prove invulnerable.<a name=2:7></a> What a privilege, that every one of us may have a living part in that!<a name=2:8></a> The Lord looks down with peculiar and affectionate interest on that which He regards as "my assembly", as a result of the work of God, that which He supports and trusts to stand invulnerable by His grace, against every attack on the truth.<a name=2:9></a> For this, at least two are needed, and that is why, in Matthew's gospel, you get an ass,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and a colt the foal of an ass.<a name=3:1></a> It contemplates at least two moving together in oneness of mind and oneness of interest.<a name=3:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A feature of these days in which we live is that the Lord has set His people <i>together</i>, though we reach the position through being exercised individually to withdraw from iniquity, and follow righteousness, faith, love, and peace.<a name=3:3></a> We do it "with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:22">2 Timothy  2:22</a>), and the individual exercise as to with-drawing from what is contrary to God is the way the Lord has used to set His people, as thus exercised, together.<a name=3:4></a> But what is to govern them as set together?<a name=3:5></a> Surely, the light of the assembly.<a name=3:6></a> If saints disregard the light of the assembly they are not following righteousness.<a name=3:7></a> Nothing can regulate the saints of God as moving together but the light of the assembly.<a name=3:8></a> While in no wise arrogating anything to ourselves, it is the privilege of the saints of God as set, and moving, together to come into the light of the assembly.<a name=3:9></a> In spite of all that has come in, the assembly is still here, and hades' gates cannot pre-vail against it; and the Lord has need of you and me, and each one who hears His voice, in order that the truth of the assembly may be maintained in a living way.<a name=3:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With that in view, the Lord introduces teaching in Matthew, for we need teaching.<a name=3:11></a> You will remember that in chapter 5 it says that the Lord Jesus went up into a mountain and sat down and His disciples came to Him, and He opened His mouth
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and taught them (verses 1, 2).<a name=4:1></a> That is to say, the Lord is on high.<a name=4:2></a> He withdrew Himself from the plain and went up into a mountain, as if to show He would not be within the reach of those who were unexercised; but that every exercised soul should reach Him.<a name=4:3></a> A certain amount of exercise was called for, if they were to receive the teaching He was ready to give, and the teaching had in view the formation of material for the assembly, so that we need, individually, to come under the Lord's teaching, under His subduing influence, if we are to fit effectively into the assembly.<a name=4:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Having opened his mouth, he taught them, saying, Blessed are the poor in spirit" (verses 2, 3), a remarkable thing with which to start His teaching, as if He would indicate, at the outset, that if we are to be suitable representatives of Him, and to have a part in the assembly, we must be prepared to accept that the assembly is formed of men who are of a different kind of spirit from that which marks us naturally; so the teaching necessitates we should have to do with the Lord.<a name=4:5></a> All He said and set before them really proceeded from what He was Himself.<a name=4:6></a> He said, "Blessed are the poor in spirit", etc.<a name=4:7></a> I cannot go into all the detail of this valuable section (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#5">Matthew  5</a>- 7); I would commend it to each one individually.<a name=4:8></a> If we would be formed so as to fit effectively into the assembly here, we must come under the teaching and subduing influence of the Lord Jesus Christ Himself.<a name=4:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will find the Lord indicates a completely

		different line of things.<a name=5:1></a> He says, "Ye have heard that it has been said .<a name=5:2></a>.<a name=5:3></a>.<a name=5:4></a> but <i>I</i> say unto you" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#5:43">Matthew  5:43</a>, 44).<a name=5:5></a> We must be prepared to let our own thoughts go, to disregard the thoughts of men in the world, and to be formed by that which the Lord has to say to us.<a name=5:6></a> What comes into evidence here is that there are two, "an ass tied, and a colt with it", and the Lord has need of <i>both</i>, suggesting old and young believers together, and that both are needed in the assembly.<a name=5:7></a> The old are needed with their experience of God, and the young with freshness of life.<a name=5:8></a> It is inconceivable that this ass should despise the colt.<a name=5:9></a> It is inconceivable that this colt would be insubject to the ass.<a name=5:10></a> They were moving together, and the Lord had need of them both.<a name=5:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How good it is to see old and young saints together in a company, rejoicing together that the Lord has need of them all; so that there should be with the old a care for the young, and with the young a respect for the old, the subjection to the old which Scripture enforces, for if these things are not in evidence it will seriously affect the testimony here for God.<a name=5:12></a> All this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, "Say to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy King cometh to thee, meek, and mounted upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass".<a name=5:13></a> If the King is meek, how essential it is that all of us should be meek!<a name=5:14></a> The One who is supreme, who was unique in His dignity, bore this character of meekness, and He intends that that character should be impressed upon His own as

		in the assembly.<a name=6:1></a> In chapter 11 the Lord invites them to "Come to me .<a name=6:2></a>.<a name=6:3></a>.<a name=6:4></a> and learn from me; for I am meek and lowly in heart" (verses 28, 29).<a name=6:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A meek person is one who does not assert his own rights, and that shows that he knows and trusts God, and is leaving his rights with God.<a name=6:6></a> It was seen in the Lord pre-eminently.<a name=6:7></a> He says, "Come to me", and "learn from me".<a name=6:8></a> If there is any assertion of our own wills, or our own rights, in that measure the light as to God is beclouded.<a name=6:9></a> The assertion of one man's will or rights against another's in the assembly is a sad blot upon the company.<a name=6:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the apostle, in writing to the Corinthians (who were far from answering to God's mind as an assembly of God) says, "I myself Paul, entreat you by the meekness and gentleness of the Christ" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#10:1">2 Corinthians  10:1</a>).<a name=6:11></a> I myself, Paul, entreat you by it -- as if to remind them that the meekness and gentleness of Christ was not an abstract idea, but had been exemplified before them in a living man like Paul.<a name=6:12></a> If God is to be seen in the assembly, if the enemy is to be powerless to introduce any thing of man there, it is essential that we should be formed after Christ.<a name=6:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul in his first epistle says he sends Timotheus "who shall put you in mind of my ways as they are in Christ" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#4:17">1 Corinthians  4:17</a>).<a name=6:14></a> Timotheus answers to the foal of the ass.<a name=6:15></a> Paul had laboured in the assemblies, but he had a brother, one formed after himself, and he could send him to Corinth to emphasise that particular feature -- his ways "as they are in Christ" -- in order that they might be reproduced in Corinth.<a name=6:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I pass on to Mark's gospel, and there, what is in view is the ministry, the service, and hence the Lord claims a colt: "ye will find a colt tied".<a name=7:1></a> "They departed, and found a colt bound to the door".<a name=7:2></a> Here it is a colt, suggesting especially those who are young, for the Lord would put in a claim to us while we are young, though I do not want to exclude anyone who is older.<a name=7:3></a> If anyone has grown older without responding to the Lord's claims, by all means let him answer to them now, but it is a colt here, suggesting that the Lord desires to secure us while we are young.<a name=7:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This colt was one "upon which no child of man has ever sat", and it was tied, suggesting very touchingly what is true of many of our young brothers and sisters.<a name=7:5></a> In the mercy of God they have been "tied", held available for the Lord -- but perhaps they have never yet recognised, definitely and absolutely that the Lord has need of them in regard of His testimony here.<a name=7:6></a> We cannot remain all our days in a neutral position.<a name=7:7></a> If we do not recognise the Lord's rights to have us absolutely, we are in danger of being claimed by that which is opposed to Christ, and so He would put in His claim early.<a name=7:8></a> "The Lord has need of it".<a name=7:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The question may be raised as to what is in view.<a name=7:10></a> Read verses 3 - 6.<a name=7:11></a> "And they led the colt to Jesus".<a name=7:12></a> The colt does nothing but move in such a way that Christ is brought into evidence; he is entirely at the command of the Lord.<a name=7:13></a> What a support for the testimony that would be!<a name=7:14></a> How essential that there should

	<div class="paragraph">
		be this living support of the testimony!<a name=8:1></a> The gospel must indeed be preached, but let the preaching be supported, let the power of the preaching be seen in that we are marked by that which is different from what would characterise us naturally.<a name=8:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we refer to Philippians we see that we must be concerned as to this all through our lives.<a name=8:3></a> From Rome the apostle tells them that they have had "fellowship with the gospel, from the first day until now" (chapter 1: 5).<a name=8:4></a> Here we have an evangelical company in real sympathy with the gospel.<a name=8:5></a> "Because to you it has been given, as regards Christ, not only the believing on him but the suffering for him also" (chapter 1: 29, 30) -- it was not simply a matter of preaching with the Philippians.<a name=8:6></a> They were wholly committed to the name of the Lord Jesus, and prepared to suffer, if needs be, for His name.<a name=8:7></a> In writing to them, the apostle shows how much he himself was developed on the line indicated in this colt.<a name=8:8></a> He had been a man active in service, and faithful to the Lord in it above all others, but at the end of his days we find him shut up in prison, and certain brethren outside thinking to add tribulation to his bonds: "Some indeed also for envy and strife .<a name=8:9></a>.<a name=8:10></a>.<a name=8:11></a> preach the Christ" (chapter 1: 15), preaching a popular gospel of which Paul would not approve.<a name=8:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How does Paul take it?<a name=8:13></a> Is he repining because he is cut off from active service?<a name=8:14></a> He shows what was the secret of his life -- "according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but in all boldness, as always, now also

		<a name=9>[Page 9]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christ shall be magnified in my body whether by life or by death" (chapter 1: 20) -- he shows that it had been his motive all the way through, that Christ should be magnified in his body, that his movements should be such as would bring Christ into evidence.<a name=9:1></a> What a support for the gospel that one who, in his young days, was known as an insolent overbearing man and a persecutor, should be moving in all kinds of circumstances and in such a way that Christ came into evidence.<a name=9:2></a> Who could deny the reality and power of a gospel that could transform such a man so that Christ was magnified in all his movements?<a name=9:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is what is in view in this colt.<a name=9:4></a> (Read <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#11:7">Mark  11:7</a> - 9).<a name=9:5></a> All that would appear great in the eyes of man was cast down in order that Christ alone should move in triumph before them.<a name=9:6></a> Paul says, he was a "Hebrew of the Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee", etc.<a name=9:7></a> He goes over all the garments he had worn at one time and says, "what things were gain to me these I counted, on account of Christ, loss" (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3:5">Philippians  3:5</a> - 7).<a name=9:8></a> So you can see how he cast his garments down.<a name=9:9></a> He laid aside everything that would have lent distinction to himself, in order that Christ alone should come into evidence.<a name=9:10></a> "But if also I am poured out as a libation on the sacrifice and ministration of your faith, I rejoice, and rejoice in common with you all" (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:17">Philippians  2:17</a>), as if to say, 'If it is needful that I should go the whole length of being poured out in death as an offering, I am content'.<a name=9:11></a> In that way he was brought into complete correspondence to Christ as one who was wholly yielded up to God, in spite
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=10>[Page 10]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		of what it involved for himself.<a name=10:1></a> You see him, not repining that he could no longer serve publicly, but showing that the motive power of his life and service had been that Christ should be brought into evidence, and he would close his days in the glad acceptance of the will of God for him, because, in that spirit, Christ was expressed.<a name=10:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I pass on to Luke's gospel.<a name=10:3></a> The account in Luke leads up to that which is priestly in character.<a name=10:4></a> Luke's gospel always has what is priestly in view, and so we find, following on this incident in Luke, that the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice.<a name=10:5></a> On the other hand, we find the Lord beholding the city and weeping over it.<a name=10:6></a> Priestly movements Godward are in evidence and priestly sympathies in regard of the actual condition of things down here.<a name=10:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In regard of priestly movements Godward, the colt was needed by the Lord and was brought to Him.<a name=10:8></a> Have we the power to have part in priestly movements for the pleasure of God, in presence of that which does not outwardly suggest the triumph of what is of God?<a name=10:9></a> The secret is whether we are with Christ.<a name=10:10></a> They brought the colt to Jesus.<a name=10:11></a> If we come to the Lord, we shall be in the secret of what God has secured in Christ, though we shall be greatly affected by the increasing evil and corruption around.<a name=10:12></a> Here was nothing outwardly to suggest any great power or triumph.<a name=10:13></a> There was no outward accompaniment of power, the atmosphere around was murderous, and Jesus Himself was about to be

		crucified, and yet in these conditions, "all the multitude of the disciples began, rejoicing, to praise God with a loud voice for all the works of power which they had seen, saying, Blessed the King that comes in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest".<a name=11:1></a> It suggests an appreciation of Christ at the present time.<a name=11:2></a> In view of the conditions around, it is only as we are near the Lord that we can be maintained, and thus have part in priestly service Godward.<a name=11:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This gospel presents the Lord as, "The Christ of God" (chapter 9:20).<a name=11:4></a> You remember when He was brought as a child into the temple at Jerusalem, Simeon was there, and it had been revealed to him, by the Spirit, that he should not see death until he had seen the Lord's Christ.<a name=11:5></a> It says, "he [Simeon] came in the Spirit into the temple; and as the parents brought in the child Jesus .<a name=11:6></a>.<a name=11:7></a>.<a name=11:8></a> <i>he</i> received him into his arms, and blessed God" (chapter 2: 27, 28); but what was it that he took up in his arms?<a name=11:9></a> On the one hand it was the Christ of God, and on the other hand it was a Babe, in all the outward circumstances of littleness and weakness, brought up by parents who were so poor that they could not offer the normal sacrifice the law demanded, but had to bring two turtledoves, or two young pigeons.<a name=11:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord was there in circumstances of littleness and weakness, but Simeon was there in the Spirit.<a name=11:11></a> Was he affected by the outward conditions of littleness and weakness and poverty?<a name=11:12></a> No; being a man in the Spirit, and in the apprehension of the

	<div class="paragraph">
		What are outward conditions if we are in the light of the One who has gone up far above all heavens that He might fill all things; and the One in whom the holy and blessed purposes of a God of infinite love and wisdom are secured, and which are about to be brought in?<a name=12:2></a> What matters it if the conditions outwardly are those of extreme weakness and littleness and poverty?<a name=12:3></a> If we are marked by the features of the Spirit, as was Simeon, we shall find our souls will be preserved in the light of all that God has secured in Christ, the Christ of God.<a name=12:4></a> Think of God in His own blessedness and greatness conceiving thoughts of love which only the divine mind could conceive, and only divine wisdom and power could bring to pass, and how all these thoughts involved the necessity of the Lord Jesus Christ coming into Manhood.<a name=12:5></a> He is the Christ of God, the One whom God has anointed for the bringing in of all His pleasure, and those who are in the Spirit appreciate the Christ of God; so if there is nothing but dishonour here, we can look up to where Christ is.<a name=12:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is our privilege, as having to do with the Lord, as brought to Him, and as giving place to the Spirit, to have part in the response down here in praising God for all the blessedness that is set before us in Christ -- praising God in the midst of a scene of darkness and barrenness and departure from Him.<a name=12:7></a> On the other hand, there are priestly feelings and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The truth as to Christ is increasingly being given up, so that ultimately there will be no place for Him at all, and it says, "And as he drew near, seeing the city, he wept over it".<a name=13:8></a> You may be sure that those feelings of sorrow, in regard of that which God had carefully tended for so many years, were grateful to the heart of God; so will our sorrows be.<a name=13:9></a> One feels how small one is, but the Lord would develop in us spiritual sorrows that would take account of the actual condition of that which is so entirely heartless as to God.<a name=13:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The heavenly city, being formed of the saints, is taken account of in this chapter in Revelation, and I just wish to dwell upon it for the remainder of the time.<a name=46:6></a> It says in verse 10, which I read, "And he carried me away in the Spirit, and set me on a great and high mountain, and shewed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God, having the glory of God".<a name=46:7></a>

		I desire by the Lord's help to keep your interest that you might see how in the aggregate we are to be the vessel of God's glory, as descending from God out of heaven.<a name=46:8></a> I have no doubt that the assembly may be viewed, and is viewed, in a retrospective way in this chapter.<a name=46:9></a> That is, she is looked upon as the wife; that character has marked her, viewed according to what she was as formed of the Spirit, throughout the long night of the Lord's absence.<a name=46:10></a> A wife is to be trusted.<a name=46:11></a> You will recall how the false wife described in <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#7:20">Proverbs  7:20</a> says that her husband has gone a long way on a journey, and has taken a bag of money with him, and so she abandons herself to unfaithfulness in his absence.<a name=46:12></a> That is the

		Happily for us, the scripture answers the question by giving us the heads of all events before us, namely, "The morning cometh, and also the night".<a name=65:2></a> Blessed be God, the great and leading subject is the morning, the "morning without clouds" (<a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#23:4">2 Samuel  23:4</a>); and the harbinger of that great moment is "the bright and morning star" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:16">Revelation  22:16</a>).<a name=65:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The coming of our Lord, when we shall meet Him in the air, is the special hope given to us; and unless this hope forms and defines the end of all our expectation, there will be a defective way of looking at the night.<a name=65:4></a> It is, "in thy light shall we see light" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#36:9">Psalm  36:9</a>); and it is as we have the brightness of His coming before us as our one simple, unmixed hope, that we shall be able, in the light of it, to form a true judgment of what is transpiring in the night.<a name=65:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Unless the coming of the Lord is before me, I have not the true hope of the church before me, and all my works and services will be characterised by this defect.<a name=65:6></a> Without this hope I cannot have a true object for my heart, and if I have not, I cannot prevent other things from taking a place in my heart; so that the coming of the Lord, the Harbinger of the day, must be my only polar star.<a name=65:7></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The brightest moment is the one on which my heart is fixed, whatever intervenes; and because I am thus assured of it, and independent of all present things, I can truly and calmly analyse the nature of them; not to discover anything to divert me from my hope, but to ascertain anything and everything which would contribute to the name of my absent Lord, helping His people according to the grace given me.<a name=66:3></a> "The Spirit and the bride say, Come.<a name=66:4></a> And let him that hears say, Come.<a name=66:5></a> And let him that is athirst come; he that will, let him take the water of life freely" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:17">Revelation  22:17</a>).<a name=66:6></a> Here, in view of the bright and morning Star, is summed up the service of the church at the close of the night.<a name=66:7></a>

		Now in order to carry out any branch of this service, I have to come in contact with the night, with the many obstructions which the prince of darkness raises up to check and suppress the light.<a name=66:8></a> To note these various devices, and the energies which mark the night, is incumbent also on the watchman; always bearing in mind that he must not study the current and commotions here in themselves, but as they hinder or attempt to counteract the word of the Lord.<a name=66:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These truths as they were received greatly helped souls.<a name=68:3></a> The certainty of Christ's finished work placing the believer not only in assurance of safety, but in his acceptance with God, was new and incontrovertible.<a name=68:4></a> How could a believer have Christ as his Head in heaven unless he was first accepted in the Beloved; and how could he be here, united to the members of the body of Christ, if he had not received the Holy Spirit, which is the seal of being established in Christ?<a name=68:5></a> This truth, the true and only ground for peace, or life, or church position, was opposed in many ways.<a name=68:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The drift of Puseyism was trying in some way to quiet the conscience by bodily exercise.<a name=68:7></a> Alas!<a name=68:8></a> many were thus turned away from the light.<a name=68:9></a> Satan had seen further for evil than his agents; and he had prepared the hood or blind for them before the light reached them.<a name=68:10></a> Many were propped up and deceived by devotional exercises as the means of obtaining rest for their consciences, long before the faintest glimmer of the light reached their eyes; so that when it did, they rejected or opposed it.<a name=68:11></a> Justification by faith was not opposed, but the certainty of full acceptance with God in Christ was utterly refused at first, because this truth leaves no place for religion in the flesh.<a name=68:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another form of opposition was the doctrine that Christ by incarnation connected Himself with man, in order to raise and restore the old stock, and not, as
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=69>[Page 69]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		according to Scripture, that He died for all, and that, rising again, every one in Him is a new creation.<a name=69:1></a> It was reformation, not transformation.<a name=69:2></a> It is evident that this theory, which was openly taught in print, secretly and wickedly sought to divert the souls from the light.<a name=69:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On this followed from within -- that is, from among those who had accepted the light -- a very serious defection from it, and one of great warning.<a name=69:4></a> It was taught, and influence was gained by the teaching, that the church will be in the tribulation; thus indirectly, and for a time unsuspectedly, the light was ignored by its professors, which up to this had survived many an opposition, and had penetrated far and wide.<a name=69:5></a> If the church be in the judgment, then it is not the body of Christ, bound to Him, the Head, in heaven; it is simply, as many would maintain, a congregation of all believers, from Abel down to the last one -- and then there is no body at all.<a name=69:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As this obtained, there was a return to form, and a practical denial of the Spirit's rule, and of the responsibility of the assembly to decide on matters of discipline; so that the principles which the light had disclosed and inculcated were rejected.<a name=69:7></a> Hence there was no option for the upright, for those really in the light, but distinct and absolute separation from this heresy, as it was eventually proved to be by the false doctrine which lay at the base of the system.<a name=69:8></a> It is to be noted here that the leaven of independence which sprang up in connection with this opposition to the light has worked in many to this day, so that the very
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		professors of the light are the great neutralisers of it -- a great success to the power of darkness.<a name=70:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The light, having triumphed over this secret and well-constructed device, grew and increased in vigour and definiteness.<a name=70:2></a> Numbers had received it, and there was a marked advance in intelligence, which enjoined and insisted on complete separation from the system of wickedness which had sprung up in their midst.<a name=70:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now arose a new stratagem of the enemy, new in form and character.<a name=70:4></a> The light, as I have said, had greatly extended, and now the device or snare was to popularise it.<a name=70:5></a> At first this was hardly noticeable.<a name=70:6></a> Many earnest men went forth preaching the gospel, using every means to obtain large audiences, unintentionally and ignorantly departing from the great truth insisted on, when the light was simply held, that there was no power here for Christ but the Holy Spirit.<a name=70:7></a> However, the gospel extended, souls were saved, consciences were relieved; and that being gained, many sought no more.<a name=70:8></a> Salvation became the all in all, and the church, Christ's interest and glory here in His body, was less noticed and cared for.<a name=70:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This gave rise to a very peculiar state of things.<a name=70:10></a> There was a large company of preachers who avowed that they only sought the salvation of souls, and had no clear idea of where they should pasture; like one wearing coloured glasses, they had not the full scope of the light.<a name=70:11></a> This weakening of the truth was eventually gigantically headed up in the most public and effective way by those who taught that
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=71>[Page 71]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		separation from the world order was neither incumbent nor necessary for the believer, thus making the gain of the soul the only aim and desire.<a name=71:1></a> Concurrently it was taught that holiness by faith could be reached without separation from any of the systems, thus in spirit and in effect invalidating the great moral value of the light, that we are Christ's body on the earth, and that now, with trimmed lamps, we are going forth to meet Him.<a name=71:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am conscious that I could never even give an outline of the damage done to souls by this daring divorce of what God has joined together, namely, Christ's glory and my blessing; but I would just give a few results of this, the latest contravention of the power and scope of the light.<a name=71:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, unknowingly and imperceptibly, the mass of those who had received the light and owned that it was of God were leavened with the notion that the salvation of the soul was everything, even while they outwardly conformed to the truth of gathering together to the name of Christ as their true church position.<a name=71:4></a> Undivided attention to everything connect-ed with the gospel marked them, and this with a surrender of the manner of life and separation in every line which members of the body of Christ on earth would feel bound to observe.<a name=71:5></a> Provided that the conscience was kept quiet and at ease as to the safety of the soul, everything else was secondary; and the formal appearance at the Lord's table was more a corroboration of one's faith in Christ than an expression, in joy of heart, of His body on the earth

		now in the fellowship of His death.<a name=72:1></a> Thus, with increase of numbers, there was no increase of power.<a name=72:2></a> Those who avow the truth as a whole, but really reject it -- except as far as their own immediate gain is concerned -- hinder and deform the teaching and testimony of those consistently holding to the full requirements of the truth.<a name=72:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not that there is not an increased number of true witnesses, but their work is thwarted and shaded by many who, while avowedly in company with them, are not in fellowship.<a name=72:4></a> A mixed thing is never very striking or impressive; the light is clouded by its associate.<a name=72:5></a> Hence, where much sacrifice would be entailed, men cannot see the same vigour and power in the advocates of the truth as in former days, when they were not connected with so mixed a company which neutralised their testimony.<a name=72:6></a> But in addition to this, the gospel, as far as ensuring salvation, can be heard outside and apart from separation; so that in a twofold way men in the world are less moved by the truth than they used to be.<a name=72:7></a> All this varied opposition to the light has given greater opportunity to the caviller, the infidel.<a name=72:8></a> He hears of theories and of assumption, but sees very little of the power of God's Spirit putting a man in a new position here on earth, in open and manifest superiority to his former circumstances, so that all must own that it is supernatural and unprecedented in human society.<a name=72:9></a>

		THE MAINTENANCE OF THE TRUTH

	<div class="paragraph">
		F. E.<a name=85:10></a> Raven
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It appears to me that in the issue of a new serial -- <i>Food for the Faithful</i> (1898) -- it is important to make plain that the object in so doing is the maintenance and setting forth of that which is true in
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=86>[Page 86]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		doctrine, not the promulgation of that which is new.<a name=86:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That there has been in the present century a remarkable revival of the truth of the Church, no intelligent Christian can, I think, gainsay; and the effect of this has been felt, far and wide, beyond the immediate circle which has been formed by the truth thus revived in God's goodness.<a name=86:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In later years the question has arisen as to how the great truths involved in the Church, such as the calling of God, eternal life, new creation and union are to be maintained.<a name=86:3></a> The effort to secure them by the use of fixed statements and conventional terms, devoid of elasticity, has proved entirely inefficacious; as has also the mode of attaching every-thing to the believer as a possession, the good of which is experienced in the power of the Spirit.<a name=86:4></a> Souls trained in this school must necessarily stop short of any apprehension of new creation.<a name=86:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is now largely admitted that a Christian's apprehension of God's calling cannot be anything beyond the measure of God's work in him.<a name=86:6></a> He may claim standing and privilege, have prophecy, understand all mysteries and all knowledge intellectually, have faith to remove mountains, and, without love, be nothing.<a name=86:7></a> A Christian's measure for God and for the assembly is love, and love is evidently the work of God in him.<a name=86:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this brings me to the conclusion that the real and only way to secure truths which have been revived is in our being the expression of those truths; holding the truth in love; and at the same time
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=87>[Page 87]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		watchful that, while having the full light of God's will in Christ, we do not arrogate to ourselves anything beyond what we are as the effect and fruit of God's work in us; for it is evident that we cannot have the conscious sense of any truth, save as we are in the state which corresponds to that truth (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:30">1 Corinthians  1:30</a>); and it is, I think, unsafe to talk much of things of which we have not the consciousness.<a name=87:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		While speaking thus of consciousness, I do not mean to put it in the place of faith.<a name=87:2></a> The first light of God in the soul is by faith.<a name=87:3></a> We are justified by faith, saved by faith, sons of God by faith, risen together with Christ by faith, and Christ is to dwell in our hearts by faith.<a name=87:4></a> So that in the christian course the scope of faith is more and more enlarged.<a name=87:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At the same time it is certain that a large part of the New Testament is occupied with bringing before us the work of the Spirit of God in the believer, which forms him for approach to God in the consciousness of his soul; and consciousness in this sense must be in the new man.<a name=87:6></a> The old man has nothing to say to it.<a name=87:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As a proof and illustration of what I have said, I would draw attention to the epistle to the Hebrews.<a name=87:8></a> In the first ten chapters we have but little unfolded as to the state of the Christian (save a state of unbelief and danger of apostasy).<a name=87:9></a> What is brought to light is the new order of things which is the necessary moral consequence of the sacrifice and priesthood of Christ, not only in the setting aside of what previously existed, but in the introduction of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that which is perfect as both expressing and answering to God's mind.<a name=88:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11">Hebrews  11</a>to 13, however, we get the question of christian state elucidated, and learn how it is formed.<a name=88:2></a> The first great principle of it is faith, which is, for this moment, the principle of living.<a name=88:3></a> This is not peculiar to Christianity, for it was announced as a principle to the prophet Habakkuk in view of the coming of the Lord.<a name=88:4></a> What I understand by this is that the soul is in the light of God's testimony, not in the moral darkness which is around.<a name=88:5></a> This testimony is for us of the glory of God and Jesus at the right hand of God.<a name=88:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This principle of faith puts us in the line of the witnesses.<a name=88:7></a> It involves that the soul is in the light of God's pleasure and perfect satisfaction.<a name=88:8></a> But in chapter 12, we have not, so far as I know (after the opening), any allusion to faith, but in a sense what is greater than faith, namely, the chastening of God, and its voice and meaning to those who are the subjects of His discipline; together with the purpose to which the chastening is directed.<a name=88:9></a> The chapter necessitates a distinction between mere professors and those who are really of God.<a name=88:10></a> In His discipline God does not occupy Himself with bastards; they are not genuinely of Him, though they may be in the place of profession; and hence they are not disciplined.<a name=88:11></a> Those who come under discipline are the objects of love -- they are of God, and thus sons; and if even they have not accepted the assurance of this by the Spirit, they may learn by discipline that

		It would be admitted by all who are familiar with Scripture, that the truth of translation comes out first in connection with Enoch, "By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him; for before his translation he has the testimony that he had pleased God" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:5">Hebrews  11:5</a>).<a name=97:1></a> In his prophecy he does not speak of translation, but of the coming of the Lord, "Behold, the Lord has come amidst his holy myriads" (<a href="../bible/Jude.htm#14">Jude  14</a>); but the truth of translation is first introduced with him.<a name=97:2></a> I think, too, it is a principle in Scripture, that in the first introduction of a thought you get the main features connected with it, and these mark it right through Scripture.<a name=97:3></a> So here one of the main features connected with translation is that God translates what pleases Him.<a name=97:4></a> Enoch had the "testimony that he had pleased God".<a name=97:5></a> I suggested reading these scriptures that our attention might be called to this thought, that pleasing God precedes translation.<a name=97:6></a>

		It seems to me that we have in Simeon the thought of one who was at the very centre of divine things: "there was a man <i>in Jerusalem</i> whose name was Simeon".<a name=116:3></a> God would have us, beloved brethren, to cherish the thought of being at the centre of divine interests.<a name=116:4></a> Alas!<a name=116:5></a> our hearts are too ready to be content to be at a distance, but why should we be found at Dan or Beer-sheba if it is possible to be in Jerusalem?<a name=116:6></a> After the return from captivity "the people cast lots to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem, the holy city" (<a href="../bible/Nehemiah.htm#11:1">Nehemiah  11:1</a>).<a name=116:7></a> Nine out of every ten were content to dwell in their cities away from the divine centre, and yet they recognised that Jerusalem was the favoured spot, for they blessed those "that willingly offered themselves to dwell in Jerusalem" (verse 2).<a name=116:8></a> This shows that even in times of recovery there is danger of missing the greatest privilege of the moment.<a name=116:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		This "man in Jerusalem" was marked by the fact that "the Holy Spirit was upon him".<a name=117:3></a> Even in Old Testament times God called attention to certain individuals who were said to have the Spirit, or to have the Spirit upon them.<a name=117:4></a> This must have suggested to every pious Israelite the possibility of such a thing.<a name=117:5></a> It was clearly in God's mind that His Spirit should be upon men.<a name=117:6></a> Thinking of those favoured men, every pious Israelite must have been ready to say, Would that it had been me!<a name=117:7></a> But such a favour was not within the reach of all then.<a name=117:8></a> It was not until Jesus was glorified that the Holy Spirit became available for all who believe on Him.<a name=117:9></a> And this, indeed, in a much more blessed way than any Old Testament saint, or even Simeon himself, could know (see <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:16">John  14:16</a>, 17).<a name=117:10></a> But the very fact that it is so is intended to raise exercise.<a name=117:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We are told of the five prudent virgins that they "took oil in their vessels with their torches" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#25:4">Matthew  25:4</a>).<a name=117:12></a> It was <i>their</i> exercise to be thus furnished.<a name=117:13></a> The Holy Spirit is available on the divine side; there is no restriction, no limitation, on that side.<a name=117:14></a> Indeed, the Old Testament promise, quoted by Peter on the day of Pentecost, that the Spirit would be "poured out" on all flesh (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:18">Acts  2:18</a>), showed how extensive was the thought of God.<a name=117:15></a> But on our side the Lord has suggested that we should "take oil" in our vessels.<a name=117:16></a> The Holy Spirit is the gift of God, but a gift is to be

		received, and many scriptures speak of the <i>reception</i> of the Spirit, and I do not think it is ever supposed that this takes place unconsciously.<a name=118:1></a> What God does sovereignly is <i>His</i> matter; I dare say He often gives the Spirit to believers on the Lord Jesus who have had little exercise about the Spirit, but normally He would give souls exercise about this great gift, so that it is not a matter in which they have part without their being aware of it.<a name=118:2></a> God would have His gift valued.<a name=118:3></a> The Lord suggested to the woman at the well the wonderful character of God's giving, and His own giving, but He brought in a condition on her part.<a name=118:4></a> "Thou wouldest have asked .<a name=118:5></a>.<a name=118:6></a>.<a name=118:7></a> and he would have given" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#4:10">John  4:10</a>).<a name=118:8></a> The gift of the Spirit, as announced in the glad tidings, becomes the subject of faith; that is, we come to it in the faith of our hearts that it is in the mind and love of God to give us His Spirit.<a name=118:9></a> So we are encouraged to put in our claim with confidence; if we have received Christ as the gift of God, we are entitled also to receive the Spirit as His gift.<a name=118:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But we cannot contemplate the gift of the Spirit without realising that it necessitates moral suitability on the part of the recipient.<a name=118:11></a> The Spirit could be upon Simeon without any incongruity; he was "just and pious, awaiting the consolation of Israel"; there was nothing about him to jar on the sensitiveness of the Spirit.<a name=118:12></a> If there are dark corners where unrighteousness is hidden, or if there is a lack of piety, the Spirit cannot be restful.<a name=118:13></a> It can hardly be said of such that their hearts are purified by faith.<a name=118:14></a> It must be

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then Simeon's outlook was such that the Spirit could identify Himself with it; he was "awaiting the consolation of Israel", he was looking for "the Lord's Christ".<a name=119:8></a> The saints today are marked off from those in the world by their different outlook.<a name=119:9></a> Those in the world have no outlook that the Spirit could identify Himself with, but the saints have a divine outlook, they are looking for the coming of the Lord.<a name=119:10></a> That has been God's great objective ever since sin and death came in; it will bring all that is of God into the world.<a name=119:11></a> In Simeon's case he was, of course, awaiting the first coming of Christ; it is ours now to await His coming the second time.<a name=119:12></a> None are in harmony with the Spirit who are not awaiting the coming of Christ.<a name=119:13></a> To be out of harmony with the Spirit is to disregard His presence.<a name=119:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the Holy Spirit made communications to Simeon; He made known to him, "that he should not see death before he should see the Lord's Christ".<a name=119:15></a> We are living in a wondrous time, for the Spirit is even now making communications to the saints.<a name=119:16></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>- 16 the Lord enlarged upon the way in which

	<div class="paragraph">
		the Spirit would make divine communications.<a name=120:1></a> Clearly this was, in the first place, to those who had been with the Lord in the days of His flesh, but they were of our company, and what they got was for us.<a name=120:2></a> The Comforter brought to their remembrance all the things which Jesus had said to them.<a name=120:3></a> There must have been much more in that than has been recorded in the Scriptures.<a name=120:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Overcomers today are marked by having an ear to hear what the Spirit is saying to the assemblies.<a name=120:5></a> I wonder if we are habituated to hearing what He is saying.<a name=120:6></a> We may be quite sure that He will never say anything contrary to the Scriptures, or that cannot be substantiated from the Scriptures, but He can bring out the mind of God in a way that never would have been gathered from the Scriptures alone apart from His speaking.<a name=120:7></a> The Spirit has always something to say to the assemblies.<a name=120:8></a> Speaking is characteristic of each Person of the Trinity, and this is in a special way the time of the Spirit's speaking.<a name=120:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think it possible that, when the time comes for the assembly to be translated, the Spirit may communicate to many that they will not see death.<a name=120:10></a> One would covet to be amongst those thus favoured of God, but whether we have this privilege or it is reserved for others, let us see to it that we do get the communications which the Spirit is making.<a name=120:11></a> Let us consider the possibility of having communications from the Holy Spirit who is dwelling here, and who is acquainted with everything that is in the mind of God.<a name=120:12></a> There is no part of the will of God, or of divine

	<div class="paragraph">
		But if we are to have the gain of this we must not be "scattered abroad" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#11:52">John  11:52</a>).<a name=121:2></a> We must be at the centre of things.<a name=121:3></a> Simeon was there, and because he was there he missed nothing that was possible at the moment.<a name=121:4></a> He was where divine communications were not missed.<a name=121:5></a> A well-known servant of the Lord said that he always got things first by the Spirit, and then he had to search them out in the Scriptures.<a name=121:6></a> I say this, that we may be encouraged to give a very real place to the Holy Spirit, and to expect to get spiritual things from the Spirit.<a name=121:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we see that Simeon moved in a practical way under the control of the Spirit.<a name=121:8></a> If he had been half an hour earlier in coming into the temple, or half an hour later, he might have missed a most blessed opportunity.<a name=121:9></a> If we move with the Spirit and in the Spirit we shall not miss divinely given opportunities.<a name=121:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Simeon saw the whole salvation of God -- all that the Scriptures had spoken of for thousands of years -- substantiated in a little Child.<a name=121:11></a> It was no longer promises or statements of Scripture, but all that was of God was there substantiated in a Babe six weeks old!<a name=121:12></a> And he received Him into his arms.<a name=121:13></a> There have been moments, I dare say, when we have thought how blessed it would have been to embrace that holy Babe.<a name=121:14></a> But, beloved, it is our portion to do so -- to embrace Him in our affections.<a name=121:15></a>

		What appeared to be small was really infinitely great.<a name=122:1></a> Its outward smallness tended to hide its greatness, but it was not hidden from Simeon.<a name=122:2></a> He saw that all peoples were before God in relation to that Babe; the Gentiles were to come to light for blessing, and He would be the glory of His people Israel.<a name=122:3></a> The man at the centre could take in the circumference of divine thoughts.<a name=122:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may be sure that those who are at the centre think much of Christ, and they think much of what is of Christ, that is, of the assembly which is His body.<a name=122:5></a> Christ is not now here personally, but He is here substantially in His body.<a name=122:6></a> The Spirit would lead us to see what is here now -- His body, deriving from Him.<a name=122:7></a> The Lord said to Saul of Tarsus of His suffering saints, They are "me" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:4">Acts  9:4</a>).<a name=122:8></a> If we truly embrace Christ in our affections, we cannot fail to take account of His body here.<a name=122:9></a> He is here substantially in His body.<a name=122:10></a> We look at every believer as of the body potentially, and we want him to be of it substantially as formed in the features and moral qualities of Christ.<a name=122:11></a> We do not want merely to think of the statements of Scripture in an abstract way, but to have them brought into concrete expression in ourselves and in all saints.<a name=122:12></a> We can see that Simeon received very real substance into his arms, and God would have us to regard the assembly, the body of Christ, as a substantial thing, composed of persons who have very definitely derived from Him so as to be in their measure expressive of Him.<a name=122:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		The whole moral universe comes within the scope of the communications of the Spirit, and it is the privilege of the saints of the assembly to dwell, as it were, at the very centre.<a name=123:5></a> Hence the apostle prayed that we might be "strengthened with power by his Spirit in the inner man; that the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts, being rooted and founded in love, in order that ye may be fully able to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:16">Ephesians  3:16</a> - 18).<a name=123:6></a> If Christ personally dwells in our hearts, what is of Him in His members -- His body down here -- will have a very great place with us.<a name=123:7></a> We shall then look at the saints according to what they are potentially, and we shall desire that what they are potentially as called ones they may be substantially as formed by the Spirit in the features of Christ.<a name=123:8></a> It is evidently of immense importance that Christ should come out in His body in a substantial way; that is, as morally and spiritually formed in His members here.<a name=123:9></a> May the Lord help us in regard to these things!<a name=123:10></a>

		Clearly, according to our chapter, that which first engages us is the eating of the Lord's supper (verse 20).<a name=125:4></a> The apostle denied that the Corinthians ate the Lord's supper, for in its place each took before others his own supper, and one was hungry and another was drunken.<a name=125:5></a> But the denial of the apostle shows that properly what first engages us is the Lord's supper.<a name=125:6></a> Thus also in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20:7">Acts  20:7</a>, the sacred historian speaks of those who came together for the breaking of bread.<a name=125:7></a> That agrees with what we have here.<a name=125:8></a>

		The meaning of the Supper explains this; it is for the calling to mind of the Lord.<a name=125:9></a> When He was here in flesh He called His disciples around Himself and took charge of the whole company.<a name=125:10></a> Now we come together in His absence, and the more deeply we love Him the more we must feel His absence; but, in eating the Supper, we call Him to mind in that which

	<div class="paragraph">
		If He be thus called to mind, in the consciousness of His presence, we enter upon the sense of our companionship with Him.<a name=126:5></a> For the time, we are outside the things which are in the world, and we come to the enjoyment of all that in which He lives before God.<a name=126:6></a> He has made known to us the Father's name, and as we are with Him He brings us to enjoy all the love of the Father's heart.<a name=126:7></a> Then, as our hearts fill with the joy of this, He leads their fulness to the Father; "in the midst of the assembly will I sing thy praises" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:12">Hebrews  2:12</a>).<a name=126:8></a> What can equal this!<a name=126:9></a> He brings us to share His own joy in the Father's love, and to join the praise which He sings to the Father.<a name=126:10></a>

		The time in which Nehemiah laboured for the good of his people was not one of those brilliant phases which, if faith be there, awaken even the energy of man, imparting to it its own lustre.<a name=128:1></a> It was a period which required the perseverance that springs from a deep interest in the people of God, because they are His people; a perseverance which, for this very reason, pursues its object in spite of the contempt excited by the work, apparently so insignificant, but which is not the less the work of God; and which pursues it in spite of the hatred and opposition of enemies, and the faintheartedness of fellow-labourers (chapter 4: 8, 10, 11); a perseverance which, giving itself up entirely to the work, baffles all the intrigues of the enemy, and avoids every snare, God taking care of those who trust in Him .<a name=128:2></a>.<a name=128:3></a>.<a name=128:4></a>

		I have in mind, dear brethren, to say a word as to manhood in a spiritual sense, including, of course, both brothers and sisters; first, in relation to piety, and then in relation to spirituality, and then the great elevation which Scripture presents as open to a "man in Christ".<a name=129:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is clear that God takes pleasure in men, and that itself gives cause for thanksgiving on our part, but He desires full growth, He desires manhood.<a name=129:3></a> Of course, when we are first brought to the Lord and receive the glad tidings, we commence as babes in Christ, and that is normal at that point, but it ought not to remain so for long.<a name=129:4></a> God has nothing less in mind than that we should develop into men, men in Christ.<a name=129:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You remember that the apostle in writing to the Corinthians, spoke to them reproachfully and said he had to write to them as "babes in Christ" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3:1">1 Corinthians  3:1</a>).<a name=129:6></a> That was a serious matter, for he had laboured among them and exemplified the truth among them for eighteen months, and yet when he wrote to them some little time after, he had to say that they were babes in Christ.<a name=129:7></a> He says, "For when one says, <i>I</i> am of Paul, and another, <i>I</i> of Apollos, are ye not men?<a name=129:8></a>" (verse 4), that is, men according to what the world around thinks of manhood.<a name=129:9></a> But to be men according to that standard is a reproach to a Christian, and so, along with that, as taking on the characteristics of

	<div class="paragraph">
		the world around, and being men in that sense, that involves that as to what we really are we are only babes in Christ.<a name=130:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, as I say, God has in mind that we should grow and develop in manhood.<a name=130:2></a> Many of us have had before us in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4">Ephesians  4</a>that what is in mind in the ministry which the Lord gives from heaven, in the power of the Holy Spirit operating in the gifts, is that we should arrive "at the full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:13">Ephesians  4:13</a>).<a name=130:3></a> God has nothing less in mind than that, and if He comes out with His thoughts of blessing towards men, He has ability in the Holy Spirit to bring about a perfect answer to those thoughts in manhood.<a name=130:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So we are to apprehend in Christ the great standard of manhood according to God.<a name=130:5></a> We are to come to "the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God" (verse 13).<a name=130:6></a> The Son of God is to stand out before our hearts as the great ideal of manhood, speaking reverently, that God has before Him, perfectly responding to Himself and to all that He desires; and the contrary character of the scene in which we are for the moment in God's ways, is all intended in His wisdom to develop us in features of manhood.<a name=130:7></a> But the secret of the development is that God Himself is before us, and is brought in in a practical way in our consciences and exercises into the circumstances of our life here.<a name=130:8></a>

		to meet so far as we know, they came to a point which they called Mizpah, meaning 'watchtower' (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#31:48">Genesis  31:48</a>, 49), and Laban takes the initiative; he calls upon Jacob as before God, the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, to bear in mind that when they are parted from one another and no one is with them, God would be witness between them, that is to say, he set Jacob in his own consciousness in the sense that even when Jacob was separated from everybody else, was not in the presence of the brethren, notwithstanding that, the eye of God was upon him.<a name=131:1></a> That is a very salutary matter, dear brethren, and it is very remarkable, that God should use Laban to bring that to bear upon Jacob.<a name=131:2></a> It was Jacob that God had in mind for development spiritually.<a name=131:3></a> Jacob was on the way to the house of God, to Bethel, which is a further thought, and greatly helps in the promotion of practical piety with us, but to begin with he came to this point, Mizpah, in which he was to remember that wherever he was, and even when he was not with the brethren, the eye of God was upon him.<a name=131:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I say that is a very wholesome matter, dear brethren, and later on in the history of Israel, Samuel took it up as a great judge, as one of the places that he visited yearly in his circuit among the people (<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#7:16">1 Samuel  7:16</a>).<a name=131:5></a> He judged the people there.<a name=131:6></a> He judged them also at Bethel, but he judged them at Mizpah.<a name=131:7></a> If matters came up for judgment when Samuel was at Mizpah he would say to them, 'Have you forgotten that God sees, have you forgotten that

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As I say, after Jacob left Mizpah he came, two or three chapters afterwards, to Bethel, the house of God.<a name=132:3></a> That was the point that God had in mind to bring him to just then.<a name=132:4></a> When he comes to that point, and is according to God and can present a drink- offering there, then the first stage of Jacob's spiritual history has reached its climax.<a name=132:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The thought of Bethel, of course, is that we are the house of God, not simply that God's eye is upon us, but that God Himself is dwelling in His people.<a name=132:6></a> He is always there, He is present.<a name=132:7></a> Not simply His eye upon us, as it were, from a distance, but He is there with us, dwelling in us as a matter of great nearness, and that is something that will greatly help us.<a name=132:8></a> The exercises of recent years as to the Holy Spirit have helped us greatly in this direction to remind us that the Spirit has taken up His abode in us, not simply collectively in the assembly but in us each individually, and there He dwells; and so we are always near to God, and God is always near to us, and He is near to us in love, but as never surrendering the holiness which befits His presence.<a name=132:9></a>

		seat of scorners".<a name=133:1></a> Notice the 'nots', the great emphasis, you might say, that the Spirit of God would place upon the 'nots'.<a name=133:2></a> It is a question of a man going through an evil world in which he is in contact with the wicked and sinners and scorners, but the attitude of his soul is 'not'.<a name=133:3></a> He maintains the spirit of separation.<a name=133:4></a> He may have to have dealings with such men in the course of his business, but the attitude of his mind is that he will not walk in the counsel of the wicked, and he will not stand in the way of sinners, and he will not sit in the seat of scorners, because God has said that such an one is blessed.<a name=133:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		One of the psalmists, the psalmist who wrote <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#119">Psalm  119</a>, said, "Thy word have I hid in my heart, that I might not sin against thee" (verse 11).<a name=133:6></a> How important and practical that is, beloved brethren.<a name=133:7></a> Another important principle from the practical standpoint is that as we go forth every day, we go forth as armed, as it says in the epistle of Peter, "Christ, then, having suffered for us in the flesh, do <i>ye</i> also arm yourselves with the same mind; for he that has suffered in the flesh has done with sin" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#4:1">1 Peter  4:1</a>), that is to say, in the light of the sufferings of Christ you arm yourself with this purpose of heart that you are not going to allow the flesh to have dominion over you.<a name=133:8></a> There may be all the influences around that would tend to draw in that direction, but you arm yourself with that mind, in the light of the sufferings of Christ, that it is well for us to suffer in the way of the disallowance of the flesh,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So one has often thought as a practical matter, dear brethren, that if Peter had had this word hidden in his heart he would never have sat down to warm himself at the fire with those who were hostile to Christ, and if he had not done that he would not have been overcome, he might not have gone to the length of denying his Lord three times (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#14:66">Mark  14:66</a> - 72).<a name=134:2></a> But, alas, he did not have this word in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#1">Psalm  1</a>hidden in his heart.<a name=134:3></a> Hence the value of reading the Scriptures, so that they are there in our hearts, they are there as something hidden that the Spirit of God has furnished in His faithfulness to us and can bring out as occasion requires.<a name=134:4></a> The more we read the Scriptures, the more we acquaint ourselves with them, the more substance we have in our souls, even though we may not understand them at the time, the Spirit of God can draw upon and use them in a preservative and sanctifying way as well as an edifying way.<a name=134:5></a> So such an one as this, who is deliberately minded to be separate, is blessed.<a name=134:6></a> God says it -- he is blessed.<a name=134:7></a> Never mind what people say, God says he is blessed.<a name=134:8></a> People may say it is narrow-mindedness, and that it is a very narrow path, but God says such an one is blessed.<a name=134:9></a>

		Then there is not only what is negative, but there is that which is positive.<a name=134:10></a> It says, "But his delight is in Jehovah's law, and in his law doth he meditate day and night".<a name=134:11></a> It is a daily matter, not something that is taken up spasmodically and then left, but "in

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So it says, "And he is as a tree planted by brooks of water, which giveth its fruit in its season".<a name=135:5></a> He is constantly fresh, "as a tree planted by brooks of water".<a name=135:6></a> It is remarkable how constantly there are allusions in the Scripture to the Holy Spirit of God and the way that we can draw upon the wealth, and the faithfulness, there is in the Spirit of God; sometimes spoken of as a river, here spoken of as brooks, but something as to which there are roots that draw from.<a name=135:7></a> You may be sure that, if a tree is planted by brooks of water, the roots of the tree will go down into the brooks of water, and so "he is as a tree planted by brooks of water, which giveth its fruit in its season, and whose leaf fadeth not; and all that he doeth prospereth".<a name=135:8></a> What a commendation that is of such a path as this.<a name=135:9></a> The Spirit of God says, All that such an one does prospers.<a name=135:10></a> It is the secret of prosperity.<a name=135:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We get other features of prosperity mentioned in the Scriptures.<a name=135:12></a> We are told in the book of Daniel that Daniel prospered -- this Daniel -- "this Daniel prospered".<a name=135:13></a> We get that at the end of <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#6">Daniel  6</a>,

		and so it throws us back in our minds to see what kind of a man Daniel was, the kind of man that prospered.<a name=136:1></a> Then you get in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#122">Psalm  122</a>that the one that loves Jerusalem prospers, the one who prays for the peace of Jerusalem, "they shall prosper that love thee" (verse 6).<a name=136:2></a> That encourages us to have the whole assembly in our minds, and the prosperity of the assembly, and to be looking out on the whole position to see what there is that is affecting the saints adversely, and to be praying in relation to it and seeing what can be done in regard to it.<a name=136:3></a> "Pray for the peace of Jerusalem; they shall prosper that love thee".<a name=136:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, this matter of practical piety in the circumstances of life is one of great importance.<a name=136:5></a> We read in the epistle to Timothy that the mystery of piety is great -- "And confessedly the mystery of piety is great.<a name=136:6></a> God has been manifested in flesh" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3:16">1 Timothy  3:16</a>).<a name=136:7></a> A wonderful thing to contemplate that God Himself in the Person of Jesus has entered, sin apart, into the ordinary circumstances of human life in which His people are, and moved in them in a way that expressed complete dependence on God, entering in at a point and in a manner in which dependence is emphasised, entering in as a babe.<a name=136:8></a> You could not have a greater expression of dependence than you find in a babe, and the Spirit of Christ through the psalmist says, "I was cast upon thee from the womb; thou art my God from my mother's belly" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22:10">Psalm  22:10</a>).<a name=136:9></a> He entered into the circum-stances of human life and glorified God in that

		Well now, I pass on to Simeon because he is a man; it says, "And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem", His interests were there.<a name=137:4></a> Jerusalem was God's centre of interest on the earth at the time.<a name=137:5></a> I need not say that what corresponds with it now is the assembly, and Simeon was a man in Jerusalem; that was where he lived.<a name=137:6></a> We are not told anything about the street or the house in which he lived, but he is said to live in Jerusalem.<a name=137:7></a> That is to say, that is where his interests were, that is where his life was found.<a name=137:8></a> He is a man in Jerusalem and he is a named man, "and this man", it says, "was just and pious, awaiting the consolation of Israel".<a name=137:9></a> What the Spirit of God is about to emphasise is the spirituality of the man, and what resulted from his spirituality in the way of intelligent praise to God, and in the way of a prophetic word to the mother of our Lord.<a name=137:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Spirit of God is going to emphasise the spirituality of the man, but before introducing that we are told that he was just, that is, righteous in a practical sense, and pious.<a name=137:11></a> I mention that, beloved brethren, because we have been speaking of piety,

		We have had before us already today the greatness and glory of God's house which, for us, speaks of the assembly -- a spiritual house (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:5">1 Peter  2:5</a>).<a name=139:10></a> It is a wonderful privilege to have part in that house, and to add to what there is for the pleasure of God in it.<a name=139:11></a>

		which Malachi wrote, at the end of God's ways in Old Testament times, and God had to say to His people, "Will a man rob God?<a name=140:1></a> But ye rob me.<a name=140:2></a> And ye say, Wherein do we rob thee?<a name=140:3></a>" showing it is possible to become insensitive to the fact that God may be deprived of His portion.<a name=140:4></a> So God says to them, "Bring the whole tithe into the treasure-house".<a name=140:5></a> The treasure-house suggests what God secures from His people that is of great value to Himself -- a wonderful contemplation!<a name=140:6></a> God would have us to bring in "the whole tithe".<a name=140:7></a> We read in Leviticus, "And as to every tithe of the land .<a name=140:8></a>.<a name=140:9></a>.<a name=140:10></a> it is Jehovah's: it is holy to Jehovah" (chapter 27:30).<a name=140:11></a> He is entitled to it and His portion must be full; but it is our privilege to bring it into the treasure-house.<a name=140:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The purpose in bringing in the tithe was "that there may be food in my house".<a name=140:13></a> It was to be the food of the Levites and the priests, suggesting that which is of Christ for our spiritual appropriation.<a name=140:14></a> But then we read in Numbers that the "tenth of the tithe" was to be for God -- "Out of all that is given you ye shall offer the whole heave-offering of Jehovah, -- of all the best thereof the hallowed part thereof" (chapter 18:29).<a name=140:15></a> So that God too has that in which He Himself delights.<a name=140:16></a> His pleasure is in all that speaks of Christ, His well-beloved Son, and nothing else is suitable to be brought into His house.<a name=140:17></a> Man has introduced much that is strange and foreign which is unacceptable to God.<a name=140:18></a> I believe at the close of this dispensation the question raised becomes a challenge to each one of us.<a name=140:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#12">Mark  12</a>we have a wonderful example of one, a widow woman, who added great wealth to the riches of God's house.<a name=141:8></a> We are told that the Lord "sat down opposite the treasury" that He might see how the crowd cast into the treasury, "and many rich cast in much".<a name=141:9></a> But the Lord knew what value to put on what this widow gave; He knew what was in her heart!<a name=141:10></a> Her two mites appeared very little compared to what the rich cast in.<a name=141:11></a> But the Lord knew how to appreciate it and He calls His disciples to Him to point out the true value of her gift.<a name=141:12></a> He says, "This poor widow has cast in more than all .<a name=141:13></a>.<a name=141:14></a>.<a name=141:15></a> for all have cast in of that which they had in abundance, but she of her destitution has cast in all that she had, the whole of her living".<a name=141:16></a> That is a fine expression, "the whole of her living"; her whole life was surrendered to the interests of the house of God.<a name=141:17></a> She had nothing left.<a name=141:18></a> You might ask why she did not cast in just one mite, for she had two.<a name=141:19></a> But no, she gave to the treasury what far exceeded the tithe -- "the whole of her living".<a name=141:20></a> Think of the pleasure of God secured in that.<a name=141:21></a> She would henceforth be entirely shut up to the

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, I pass on now to speak a little of the history of Jacob.<a name=142:3></a> I think we see in it the way God takes to secure a full response.<a name=142:4></a> Jacob was one that God had purposed for blessing; he was elect of God according to purpose.<a name=142:5></a> Even before he was born God's eye was upon him, for God had said that "The greater shall serve the less" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#9:12">Romans  9:12</a>).<a name=142:6></a> He was one whom God took up for blessing, and we should thank God that He has taken us up in His sovereign mercy; it has nothing to do with our works.<a name=142:7></a> It is "not of works, but of him that calls" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#9:11">Romans  9:11</a>) What a great a privilege it is to be called by God!<a name=142:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The history of Jacob is most interesting and encouraging for each one of us.<a name=142:9></a> To start with, he had little to offer to God.<a name=142:10></a> He is the first in Scripture to bring in the thought of the house of God.<a name=142:11></a> But he had a very poor impression of what the house of God really was.<a name=142:12></a> God appeared to him in a dream and Jacob saw a ladder set up upon the earth, the top of which reached to the heavens.<a name=142:13></a> And God stood above it.<a name=142:14></a> Jacob's first impression as he set out on his journey was that he had to do with God.<a name=142:15></a> And God took up a certain position: "Jehovah stood above it" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#28:13">Genesis  28:13</a>).<a name=142:16></a> That word "stood" means that God stationed Himself.<a name=142:17></a> Jacob could not escape the presence of God, and none of us can.<a name=142:18></a> God intimated to him that He was in communication with men -- the angels of God "ascended and descended" on this ladder.<a name=142:19></a> And that is the position with regard to God's

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		house: it is where God puts Himself in touch with men.<a name=143:1></a> And Jacob was not ready for that.<a name=143:2></a> He says, "How dreadful is this place!<a name=143:3></a> this is .<a name=143:4></a>.<a name=143:5></a>.<a name=143:6></a> the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven".<a name=143:7></a> He knew rightly how to name the place, and yet he was out of accord with it.<a name=143:8></a> Think of calling the house of God a dreadful place!<a name=143:9></a> But God was there, and Jacob got some impression of what was due to God, and he made a vow.<a name=143:10></a> It is a good thing to make a committal.<a name=143:11></a> Jacob's vow was rather one-sided, that if God look-ed after him he would of all that God gave him return the tenth.<a name=143:12></a> Well, God was very gracious and accepted what he said even though it was conditional on God looking after <i>him</i>.<a name=143:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Jacob then takes his journey and his subsequent history shows that he takes his own way to secure his own ends; he knew how to look after his own interests!<a name=143:14></a> Nevertheless, God took account of Jacob and eventually brought him back to the place where He appeared to him at the first.<a name=143:15></a> And God may do that with all of us also.<a name=143:16></a> Maybe we can remember certain things at the beginning of our histories, things that God impressed upon us.<a name=143:17></a> Well, God can bring you back to that point.<a name=143:18></a> But God brought Jacob back a changed man from the way he had gone out.<a name=143:19></a> He brought him back rich in the knowledge of Himself, and that is what God wants to arrive at with each one of us, for His pleasure.<a name=143:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, the time came for Jacob to return to Bethel.<a name=143:21></a> It is significant that it was after the birth of Joseph that he said to Laban, "Send me away, that I

	<div class="page-number">

	<div class="paragraph">
		may go to my place and to my country" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#30:25">Genesis  30:25</a>).<a name=144:1></a> Typically, Jacob moves as soon as Christ comes onto view, and the greater our impressions are of Christ the sooner we will move in relation to God's pleasure.<a name=144:2></a> Jacob returns a wealthy man.<a name=144:3></a> He had to do with Esau his brother whom he had wronged, but on the way God met him.<a name=144:4></a> He now had to do with God again.<a name=144:5></a> It says, "Jacob remained alone; and a man wrestled with him until the rising of the dawn" (chapter 32: 24).<a name=144:6></a> He wrestled with God and prevailed.<a name=144:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That was a great turning point, and suggests for us a good deal of soul exercise.<a name=144:8></a> But he prevailed.<a name=144:9></a> One thing that characterised Jacob was that he was always intent on getting the blessing.<a name=144:10></a> He said to the "man" that wrestled with him, "I will not let thee go except thou bless me" (chapter 32: 26).<a name=144:11></a> Well, it is a fine thing to seek the blessing.<a name=144:12></a> Esau, on the other hand, despised the birthright and lost the blessing of the firstborn, and there appears to have been nothing for God in his life.<a name=144:13></a> Malachi tells us that God loved Jacob and that He hated Esau (<a href="../bible/Malachi.htm#1:2">Malachi  1:2</a>, 3) -- a solemn indictment!<a name=144:14></a> But God loved Jacob.<a name=144:15></a> And, if God has set His love upon you, He will bring you through and recover you to the place where He appeared at the beginning.<a name=144:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then Jacob had his name changed.<a name=144:17></a> He was now to be called Israel -- meaning 'Wrestler, or prince of God', footnote <i>d</i>, <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#32:28">Genesis  32:28</a>.<a name=144:18></a> A prince is a wealthy and dignified person.<a name=144:19></a> In Ezekiel we read a good deal as to the prince and his place in the house.<a name=144:20></a> Christ, of

	<div class="paragraph">
		course, is supreme as "The Prince", but then, that feature of dignity is to mark the saints too, and we are to obtain spiritual wealth with which we can serve God.<a name=145:1></a> So, God had to do with Jacob to that end.<a name=145:2></a> At the same time the man that wrestled with him touched the joint of his thigh and Jacob became a changed man, for he could no longer rely, as previously, on his own strength, but now upon God.<a name=145:3></a> It says at the end of that section, "the sun rose upon him; and he limped upon his hip" (chapter 32: 31).<a name=145:4></a> From that moment forward he would be reminded of his dependence upon God.<a name=145:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then God tells Jacob in chapter 35, "Arise, go up to Bethel".<a name=145:6></a> This is a great return movement in view of arriving at the house of God, the point from which he had departed.<a name=145:7></a> And certain things had to be adjusted.<a name=145:8></a> Jacob told his family to make ready.<a name=145:9></a> He "said to his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and cleanse yourselves, and change your garments; and we will arise, and go up to Bethel".<a name=145:10></a> This is a great upward movement, a return to Bethel, the house of God.<a name=145:11></a> Certain things have to be put away, for we cannot draw near to God with anything that is unsuited to His presence.<a name=145:12></a> And we need a change of garments, for we cannot appear before God in our natural state -- we can only appear in the worth of Christ.<a name=145:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so they arise and take their journey.<a name=145:14></a> What a journey it must have been!<a name=145:15></a> And Jacob "came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Bethel", and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=146>[Page 146]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		he "built there an altar, and called the place El-Beth-el".<a name=146:1></a> He does not, as before, just call it Bethel, but El-Beth-el, 'God of the house of God', showing that through experience he now appreciated God in relation to His house and the way He had brought him back to it.<a name=146:2></a> He speaks later, at the end of his life, of "the God that shepherded me all my life long" (chapter 48: 15).<a name=146:3></a> How rich Jacob became in his knowledge and impressions of God!<a name=146:4></a> That is what we need to bring into the house today, our impressions of God and of Christ will enable us to serve God acceptably.<a name=146:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So they continue and "God appeared to Jacob again after he had come from Padan-Aram, and blessed him", and He confirmed his name Israel, and reiterated His promises to him.<a name=146:6></a> I think it shows that as we arrive at what is for God's pleasure He will confirm the fulness of His blessings to us.<a name=146:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Finally Jacob sets up a pillar and pours on it a drink-offering.<a name=146:8></a> That is additional to what he had poured on the pillar at the outset of his journey; for now he is thinking of what is for God's satisfaction, a drink-offering.<a name=146:9></a> That is a wonderful point to arrive at, that God has His pleasure, and we are able to minister what pleases Him.<a name=146:10></a> He called the name of the place where God had talked with him, "Beth-el".<a name=146:11></a> He names the place again as having, through his experience with God, a rich appreciation of the blessedness of God's house.<a name=146:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, I trust God shall exercise and encourage each one of us that, through having to do with God,

	<div class="paragraph">
		No doubt every one knows that it was a letter of commendation carried by Onesimus, a former slave to Philemon, written by the apostle Paul to Philemon, a beloved brother.<a name=147:7></a> The letter carried with it, not only the commendation of Onesimus, but the vital elements of the spirit of the christian fellow-ship.<a name=147:8></a> It is delightful that the Spirit of God is pleased to draw aside the curtain and give us to see a little of the inner life of the early brethren.<a name=147:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The details of this small epistle are so full that it is quite easy, without any imagination, to visualise some of their experiences.<a name=147:10></a> Here was a brother, Philemon,

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=148>[Page 148]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		who, under the influence of the spirit of the fellowship, had earned the title, "the beloved".<a name=148:1></a> Paul does not use flattering titles.<a name=148:2></a> He writes to "Philemon the beloved and our fellow-workman", for he is writing to a brother who has earned these titles.<a name=148:3></a> We would encourage the younger brethren to go in for earning titles.<a name=148:4></a> Men of the world are devoting their wealth and energies to secure titles which they think much of and boast in.<a name=148:5></a> It would be well if persons were found who were set upon the things of God in such a way as to be serviceable to the Lord, and thus earn such titles as these.<a name=148:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Would you not like to know how to earn such titles as "the beloved and our fellow-workman"?<a name=148:7></a> Well, it is by showing love and devoting yourself to service.<a name=148:8></a> The spirit of the fellowship is <i>love</i>.<a name=148:9></a> That is the great distinguishing feature between christian fellowship and all the other fellowships that are formed amongst men.<a name=148:10></a> The great outstanding distinguishing feature of christian fellowship is that the mighty motive power of it is love.<a name=148:11></a> Of many other fellowships on earth, the great foundational principle is love of <i>self</i>; for men may join those for the advantages that will accrue to them.<a name=148:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The love of God, the love of Christ, and the love of the brethren are the fundamental principles of the Christian fellowship.<a name=148:13></a> We are introduced at once to Philemon as "the beloved".<a name=148:14></a> We can contemplate him as a brother well proved.<a name=148:15></a> He was not a novice in the fellowship, not untried, or unproved.<a name=148:16></a> Paul could write to him sincerely, addressing him thus with

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		confidence.<a name=149:1></a> We should covet this!<a name=149:2></a> The fellowship is real and living practically: it is being maintained by those who are exhibiting in practical expression the love of Christ, circulating it amongst the brethren.<a name=149:3></a> He is a fellow-labourer -- in fellowship with regard to service, not only to take up its privileges, but taking his part in its service.<a name=149:4></a> If there was work to be done, Philemon could be counted upon to take his share.<a name=149:5></a> He is a willing-hearted labourer!<a name=149:6></a> What a dignity!<a name=149:7></a> Would you not like to be a fellow-labourer of the apostle Paul?<a name=149:8></a> These labours resulted in much prosperity to the saints, blessing to the assembly of God, increase of the body of Christ and great results in the gospel.<a name=149:9></a> Such a brother would be of great value to the assembly.<a name=149:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Philemon has a household -- another important feature, for the fellowship extends to the household.<a name=149:11></a> It is not limited to the meeting room, for that is merely a convenient place in which we can be found together, but the fellowship extends to a brother's house, and the christian household is a great asset to the fellowship.<a name=149:12></a> The spirit of the fellowship is experienced and felt in the warmth of such a house.<a name=149:13></a> We should be poorer but for christian households; our meetings would not be so marked by love, did we not experience the working out of Christianity in the household.<a name=149:14></a> In this house the saints came together; there was a room for them to assemble.<a name=149:15></a> This is a very important feature; for the Spirit of God would connect the thought of the assembly with the christian household.<a name=149:16></a> Let us not

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=150>[Page 150]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		divorce our households from the assembly, for God's thought is that every house shall be a contribution to it, and, as open to the saints of God, there should be therein expressions of love in the Lord.<a name=150:1></a> The household would thus be a place where the interests of the assembly are promoted, so that we may be more together in spirit.<a name=150:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here was a brother whose household was entirely in sympathy with the assembly; they could assemble in his house.<a name=150:3></a> It was much like the house of Obed-Edom in the days of David (<a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#6:9">2 Samuel  6:9</a> - 11).<a name=150:4></a> The Lord could visit the house of Philemon.<a name=150:5></a> We may be greatly encouraged as we consider the possibilities of a house being used for the glory of God, in which the spirit of the assembly can be developed.<a name=150:6></a> We are dependent far more than we realise on the influence of the christian home in relation to the assembly.<a name=150:7></a> Let us speak to the sons and daughters of God's people whose parents have already committed themselves to the Lord and to His interests and are in the fellowship of God's Son.<a name=150:8></a> If in your home you learn the holy lessons of obedience, subjection, affection, and mutuality; if you develop the spirit of service and unselfishness, the readiness to make sacrifice for the good of others, do you not realise that you are learning practically the principles which are to be worked out in the house of God and among the people of God?<a name=150:9></a> It is possible for a number of persons dissimilar in natural dispositions, in their stations in life, to assemble together and enjoy peace, blessing, unity, and love.<a name=150:10></a> How can it

		All these things show that the christian home is the training ground of the spirit, so that when the assembly comes together there are persons who have been secretly trained in their spirits and have become contributors of the spirit of the fellowship.<a name=151:5></a> Dear young brothers and sisters, be prepared to learn these lessons in your homes so that you may be equipped to be contributors to the spirit of the fellowship of God's Son Jesus Christ our Lord.<a name=151:6></a>

		At the beginning of this epistle two persons are mentioned: one is described as "the brother" and the other as "the sister".<a name=151:7></a> Both these are in accord with the spirit of the fellowship -- the fellowship is composed of brothers and sisters.<a name=151:8></a> Timothy had earned the title "the brother".<a name=151:9></a> I do not think he could have earned a more beautiful title.<a name=151:10></a> The happiest description we can give of a person whom we know and love, and have learned to trust, is 'he <i>is</i> a brother'.<a name=151:11></a> It is greater to be a brother than a servant!<a name=151:12></a> A brother will stand by you in sorrow, and when tests come he will remain true and faithful -- he has the spirit of a brother!<a name=151:13></a> He will support you in weakness and is one upon whose love you can

	<div class="paragraph">
		Into Philemon's household there had come a sorrow.<a name=153:4></a> If we are in christian fellowship tests must come.<a name=153:5></a> The Lord loves us too well to let us go on with all sunshine and all encouragement.<a name=153:6></a> We might soon become inflated, and think we were important persons, if we were not tested.<a name=153:7></a> Things had gone doubtless well in this assembly until one day a sorrow came, for one of the slaves had absconded.<a name=153:8></a> It was very annoying to have one who might have been of use in the household, suddenly disappear in this way.<a name=153:9></a> If there were not the spirit of the fellowship present, we should say in such a case, 'I never want to see that man again'.<a name=153:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us briefly consider some of the privileges which abide today in spite of all failure -- privileges which are proper to the whole church of God.<a name=157:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(1) <i>Fellowship</i> abides.<a name=157:13></a> From the early days (when the apostle wrote to Timothy the second time) the outward bond of christian profession, the mere fact of being a Christian, was not that which constituted the bond of fellowship.<a name=157:14></a> This was necessary, certainly, for "what part for a believer along with an unbeliever?<a name=157:15></a>" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#6:15">2 Corinthians  6:15</a>), but it was not enough.<a name=157:16></a> The <i>Lord</i> was the bond; and faithfulness to the Lord was essential if there was to be practical fellowship.<a name=157:17></a> Hence, after the exhortation to depart
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=158>[Page 158]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		from all that was inconsistent with His name, the apostle proceeds to exhort the man of God to follow certain moral qualities, positive good, and to follow these with all that call <i>on the Lord out</i> of a <i>pure heart</i> (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:19">2 Timothy  2:19</a> - 22).<a name=158:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence the Lord Himself is our bond.<a name=158:2></a> If we pursue this path we only revert to what is proper to every believer -- any one may do so.<a name=158:3></a> Indeed, such qualities should mark all.<a name=158:4></a> If we are not doing so, the hindrance is wholly on our side.<a name=158:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Fellowship thus becomes practically what it is in its real character -- the common participation together of things proper to all.<a name=158:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(2) <i>The Lord's supper</i> abides.<a name=158:7></a> The request to remember the Lord has been given to the church (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:23">1 Corinthians  11:23</a> - 26), and the response to this request is a privilege proper to the whole church of God on earth.<a name=158:8></a> And only in the recognition of the whole church, the one body, is it possible to partake of the supper.<a name=158:9></a> The "we" who partake are characteristically "one body" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10:17">1 Corinthians  10:17</a>).<a name=158:10></a> No individual can be this by himself.<a name=158:11></a> It is a collective privilege still subsisting for the whole church.<a name=158:12></a> The body of Christ still abides.<a name=158:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In a previous paper we have dwelt upon the necessity of "coming together" to respond to this re-quest of love.<a name=158:14></a> Here we are considering the question of such a privilege still existing.<a name=158:15></a> The request is to remember Him "until he come", and such language surely intimates that the privilege is to abide.<a name=158:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But it must be evident that to do this acceptably
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=159>[Page 159]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		there must first be fellowship, for if anything supposes this, the Lord's supper does.<a name=159:1></a> It is not sufficient, let us repeat here also, for a person to be a believer.<a name=159:2></a> This most certainly is essential; he is not a member of the body otherwise; but the Lord is the bond, and there must be faithfulness to Him.<a name=159:3></a> If a believer continues in iniquity and I am told to depart from it, of necessity there is an end of practical fellowship between us.<a name=159:4></a> But in obeying the injunction of the Lord to depart from iniquity and follow righteousness, etc.<a name=159:5></a>, the believer only reverts to a path open to any, a path proper to the whole.<a name=159:6></a> He returns to that holiness which should ever have marked the church.<a name=159:7></a> Hence, being in a position proper to the whole church of God, he may enjoy those privileges, in common with all in that path, which are theirs as members of Christ's body.<a name=159:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(3) The privilege of <i>worship</i> abides.<a name=159:9></a> While Scripture admits the individual, as such, worshipping, the thought of worship is usually associated with a collective idea.<a name=159:10></a> It is a spiritual privilege proper to the whole church.<a name=159:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How blessed that such a privilege still remains!<a name=159:12></a> The Spirit of God is here.<a name=159:13></a> Christians are still a priestly house capable of approaching God and intelligently worshipping Him.<a name=159:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But we can only enjoy these privileges as we comply with the conditions necessary.<a name=159:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Moreover, the readers of 2 Timothy will be struck by the fact that a collective path is supposed to exist right on to the end, though no passage of

	<div class="paragraph">
		Scripture so clearly indicates the intensely individual nature of the responsibility of the believer.<a name=160:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It must be borne in mind that no thought of God can fail, and the same power is available today as in any day of the church's history.<a name=160:2></a> We fail, but that does not alter God's truth; and hence if only we are subject to the Lord and led by the Spirit, all that is proper to the church as a whole is available to us.<a name=160:3></a> And what a testimony this necessarily becomes.<a name=160:4></a> By individually walking in faithfulness to the Lord and separation from all that is contrary to His name, even two or three become a testimony to the abiding character of all that lies in the power of the Spirit of God.<a name=160:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have been reminded recently that 'there are no circumstances or difficulties in which saints may find themselves in this world where church principles cannot be applied or made to work'.<a name=160:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord give us to be faithful.<a name=160:7></a> He is coming soon!<a name=160:8></a> The days are difficult, but there is no difficulty too great for Christ, nor for faith which rests upon Him.<a name=160:9></a> Christ is in heaven, the Spirit of God is here, the written word abides; the church of God is here today -- the body of Christ, the house of God.<a name=160:10></a> We are well equipped, but faith is necessary, as it ever was.<a name=160:11></a> We cannot please God apart from it.<a name=160:12></a>

		So the position was not at all strong or impressive outwardly, but there were those essential elements there in Joseph and Mary, and then there comes in this great and important element of a man who is characterised by the Holy Spirit.<a name=161:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One might say at this point, that what we had in the first Psalm really paves the way for spirituality, for it says in the first Psalm that what characterises the blessed man of that psalm is that his delight is in the law of God -- he delights in it.<a name=161:3></a> We find that brought in in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>.<a name=161:4></a> The speaker in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7">Romans  7</a>says, "For I delight in the law of God according to the inward man" (verse 22), but then he finds that there was a law warring in his members, the law of sin, and operating against the law of his mind, and he cries out "who shall deliver me out of this body of death?<a name=161:5></a>" (verse 24), and the answer is, the Spirit of God.<a name=161:6></a> He says, "I thank God" (verse 25), that is the answer.<a name=161:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The man arrives in that way, through actual experience and identifying himself in mind with the work of God in him, at what he was inwardly by God's work, and he learns to repudiate the working of the flesh and to recognise that the Spirit of God was available to him as power.<a name=161:8></a> He arrives in that way at the reality of deliverance.<a name=161:9></a> But then he arrives at this, that the Spirit is the only power for life.<a name=161:10></a> Paul knew it experimentally in large measure.<a name=161:11></a> He said, "For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free

		from the law of sin and of death" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:2">Romans  8:2</a>).<a name=162:1></a> How good it is to be free, free from the law of sin and death as regulated by the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus, the Spirit of God known in that way as holding the heart in relation to the Man Christ Jesus, who is always the delight of God, so that the influence of Christ by the Holy Spirit is known as affecting us and governing us in our outlook and movements.<a name=162:2></a> Then in that chapter we find that we are led on to the point that the Spirit is life on account of righteousness (verse 10).<a name=162:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All that is paving the way for spirituality, that is to say, to become characteristically spiritual, so that your tastes are spiritual and you find you have the capacity to understand spiritual things, and to move in them in the power that the Holy Spirit affords, and in spiritual intelligence, too.<a name=162:4></a> So, coming back to Simeon, it says, "as the parents brought in the child Jesus that they might do for him according to the custom of the law, <i>he</i> received him into his arms, and blessed God" -- he received the Christ of God into his arms.<a name=162:5></a> As I say, he is undeterred, not in the least affected by the outward smallness, because what great enlargement the Spirit gives when once we begin to have an apprehension of the Christ as the Christ of God.<a name=162:6></a> It does not matter then how small the circumstances outwardly in which the testimony locally may be, for we prove the great enlargement that the Spirit of God gives.<a name=162:7></a>

		One and another have often remarked on this, the wonderfulness of it, that a man who was a Jew, and the Jews had not yet been set aside, rejoicing in Christ as a Light for the revelation of the Gentiles, putting them first before the Jews.<a name=164:2></a> There was a dawning in his soul of that in which the exceeding grace of God has come to light.<a name=164:3></a> That is what we are to glory in.<a name=164:4></a> We are Gentiles who had no claim on God, but now He has brought out in regard of us the choicest thoughts that His love has devised, and they all centre in Christ.<a name=164:5></a> They have all been secured in Christ, and they have been made good in our souls just in the measure in which the Holy Spirit has liberty with us.<a name=164:6></a>

		So the result is that he blesses God.<a name=164:7></a> That is what God is after, dear brethren, that in the spontaneity of which we have been speaking, Simeon blesses God.<a name=164:8></a> We have mentioned in the course of these meetings how not only Paul but also Peter and Jude, in writing to the saints, burst out in doxologies.<a name=164:9></a> It is a question of the truth not being held in mere correctness of doctrine, but being held in a worshipful spirit, as God in His blessedness, and Christ in His blessedness, are before the heart, and so Simeon you might say, bursts out, he blesses God; he blesses Him, too, in a state of perfect contentment.<a name=164:10></a> All his hopes are now realised and he is quite prepared to depart in peace.<a name=164:11></a>

		That was the first thing that one had in mind, that as spirituality is developed, there is developed with it the ability to address God in a spontaneous and affectionate and intelligent way.<a name=165:1></a> There is ability to grasp something of what Scripture calls "the breadth and length and depth and height" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:18">Ephesians  3:18</a>), and all that enters into the kind of response Godward that He looks for in the assembly.<a name=165:2></a> It does not matter what the smallness of the position locally may be, if only there is this element of spirituality brought in, first the essential elements of love for Christ and acceptance of responsibility, and the underlying elements of righteousness and piety, and then the development of spirituality; all that God is looking for in the way of assembly response is dependent upon these things.<a name=165:3></a>

		But then not only does Simeon represent an answer in spiritual power to the blessed God, but he becomes also a prophet.<a name=165:4></a> He is first of all a priest, and now he is a prophet; he can communicate the mind of God to Mary, for, after all, we need the prophetic word in our localities.<a name=165:5></a> There are always conditions that need to be met by the prophetic word, and it is important that we should be available for the prophetic word, and spirituality is needed for that.<a name=165:6></a> So there are these features in this position, so small outwardly, and yet it is all there, because spirituality has been developed and the Spirit is recognised.<a name=165:7></a> So it says that Simeon said to Mary, "Lo, this child is set for the fall and rising up of many in Israel, and for a sign spoken against; (and even a sword shall go

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a question of whether we are attached in heart to Christ, and whether we take account of the way Christ has gone.<a name=166:3></a> He has come in in flesh and blood and He has died.<a name=166:4></a> As we were hearing on Tuesday evening, it is a question of eating His flesh and drinking His blood (<a href="../bible/John.htm#6:53">John  6:53</a>), it is a question of appropriating the fact that He has come in deliberately in flesh and blood condition, and in that condition has died, and has taken up a new condition, not flesh and blood condition, but a new condition of manhood beyond death, because God has in mind to introduce spiritual things.<a name=166:5></a> The flesh and blood condition, in which what is natural has had its place, are to be set aside in favour of what is spiritual.<a name=166:6></a> Not, of course, that the natural is refused entirely, or anything of that sort so long as we are here, but the spiritual must have precedence because God has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ.<a name=166:7></a>

		soul also.<a name=167:1></a> We read in the gospel of Luke that the Lord says, "no one having drunk old wine straightway wishes for new, for he says, The old is better" (chapter 5: 39).<a name=167:2></a> That shows what is natural to us, we say the old is better.<a name=167:3></a> There is a kind of hankering after the old, and the way of deliverance from it, dear brethren, and one speaks diffidently as knowing how much one needs help oneself, is the appreciation of Christ and the way He has gone, deliberately entering into flesh and blood conditions and then dying out of those conditions, and entering upon new conditions beyond death, and the Spirit of God having His place, as it says, "It is the Spirit which quickens, the flesh profits nothing" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#6:63">John  6:63</a>).<a name=167:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So there is, in the spirituality of Simeon, this element of prophecy brought into the matter to help the saints, and how much is needed in every locality, because, although we may touch something of the service of God in a measure of liberty and power at one time, there is no guarantee that we shall be equally ready for it in the same liberty and power on the next occasion.<a name=167:5></a> There is always need for the maintenance and development of right conditions, and so the prophetic word in the power of the Spirit has always its place and value amongst us.<a name=167:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have very little more to say.<a name=167:7></a> The last passage we read is one that refers to a man in Christ.<a name=167:8></a> Paul says, "I know a man in Christ".<a name=167:9></a> The Corinthians to whom he was writing could not be designated men in Christ, except doubtless there were those among them who could perhaps be thus spoken of, but

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Paul says, "I know a man in Christ".<a name=168:3></a> What can one say about a scripture like this?<a name=168:4></a> One man in Christ had this remarkable experience.<a name=168:5></a> Some of us were referring yesterday to Paul's knowledge, Paul's understanding of the mystery, and how he desired that we might know his understanding of the mystery.<a name=168:6></a> I recognise that that was peculiar to himself, that he was a chosen vessel taken up by the Lord to bring in the truth of the mystery, and he had remarkable intelligence in it, but yet the fact remains that he was a man like ourselves who, in the power of the Holy Spirit, had such remarkable intelligence of the mystery.<a name=168:7></a> He was equal to it in the Spirit, but now he is not referring to himself as an apostle or as one trusted with a specific message, he is referring to himself as a man in Christ, and he is showing us what is possible, what a man in Christ is capable of.<a name=168:8></a>

		He says, "I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body I know not, or out of the body I know not, God knows;) such a one caught up to the third heaven" -- as far as that, as far as the third heaven.<a name=168:9></a> What elevation for a man, beloved

		brethren, and we are all going to be caught up shortly, but this was known while he was still in the position of testimony, caught up as far as the third heaven, and then he goes over it again and repeats the word as though he would impress us with it; he says, "I know such a man, (whether in the body or out of the body I know not, God knows;) that he was caught up into paradise" -- into Paradise, the scene of God's own delights.<a name=169:1></a> He was caught up there and he heard unspeakable things which it is not allowed to a man to utter.<a name=169:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I say again, dear brethren, what can one say about a scripture like this?<a name=169:3></a> I suppose probably no one else has had an experience like it, save Paul; we do not know.<a name=169:4></a> Certainly we know no one who has had an experience like it, but there it is, why is it in Scripture?<a name=169:5></a> It evidently is not intended in our minds to be confined to Paul; it is what was given to a man in Christ, suggesting the great possibilities that may be open to a man in Christ, what a man in Christ may be capable of, that he is fitted to be taken up into the third heaven, as far as that, and fitted to be given entrance into Paradise, and to hear "unspeakable things said which it is not allowed to man to utter".<a name=169:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, one cannot say more about it save to say that there it is in Scripture, intended, I believe, to induce exercise and desire with us to really progress on this line of spiritual development, that we might reach something of manhood according to God.<a name=169:7></a> And then Paul tells us that when he came back into normal

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So it all comes back to this, dear brethren, that there are endless possibilities to us in the Spirit, but, at the same time, we have to walk humbly and carefully all the time, because we have the flesh with us all the time.<a name=170:3></a> There is always a danger that Satan will seek to exalt us even by our spiritual enjoyment or our spiritual power, whatever it might be.<a name=170:4></a> The flesh is so subtle, and Satan is so near, that we have to remember that it is always there, but as kept in the place of death, and in appreciating the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ and appropriating the Holy Spirit, we may go forward in the sense that there is nothing we may not reach in the grace of God, in the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=170:5></a>

		While every believer will admit his imperfection in <i>practice</i>, he generally considers himself correct in <i>doctrine</i>; he may own that he is ignorant of a great deal of truth, but his conscience would not be at ease if he did not think that he held what was true.<a name=215:11></a> Hence it is more difficult to convince a saint of his error in
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=216>[Page 216]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		doctrine, than of his defect in practice.<a name=216:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There cannot be correct practice with an assured conscience, but as there is correct doctrine.<a name=216:2></a> Once a saint is taught of God that he is heavenly as to calling, he may fail much in being practically heavenly, but as he knows the doctrine of his calling, he finds out that there is power given him according as he turns to the Lord to maintain his course as a heavenly saint.<a name=216:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first great point of doctrine the heavenly saints and the earthly saints are together; the sins of both are washed away in the blood of the Lamb: this one great truth is common to both, and to every saint since the foundation of the world.<a name=216:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now because this first great doctrine distinctly and unquestionably belongs to both, the tendency or snare is to conclude that it is the same with regard to other doctrines, and this snare will always be in the descending or earthly line, and not in the ascending or heavenly.<a name=216:5></a> That is to say, the calling and blessing of the heavenly saint are brought down to the line of the earthly.<a name=216:6></a> Now in the very terms 'earthly' and 'heavenly' there is an immense distinction involved; and the rest is easily learned when once this great distinction is admitted.<a name=216:7></a> The real difficulty lies in convincing saints of the fact that they <i>are</i> heavenly in the true sense of the term.<a name=216:8></a> Christians acknowledge it in a general way, because they know that heaven will eventually be their abode, but no one can see the heavenly standing who does not see that, Christ being rejected from the earth, the saint, if united to

		Him now, must be united to Him in heaven where He is; and that if not united to Him there, he has no link to Christ absent, although he is absolved from his sins by the blood of Christ.<a name=217:1></a> Moreover he is on the earth where Christ is not ruling (for He must come before He reigns), so that the portion of a saint now, if he were not united to Christ in heaven, would be infinitely worse than that of a saint in the millennium.<a name=217:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The saint in the millennium will have the happy consciousness of Christ's rule over everything.<a name=217:3></a> Satan will be bound and Christ will order everything morally as the sun rules the day materially.<a name=217:4></a> Christ is now absent, and unless the Spirit of God unites the saint to Him in heaven where He is, it is evident he is on the earth in a worse position than the earthly saint.<a name=217:5></a> But the saint now is united by the Spirit to Christ, and as he belongs to a heavenly Christ, he is on his way to heaven as his own place, even though he still be on the earth.<a name=217:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am not now stating the various doctrines which distinguish and peculiarly belong to the heavenly saint; I am seeking to establish the fact that a saint is now heavenly both as to standing and hope, because he is united to Christ in heaven, and that the one great difference between an earthly saint and a heavenly one is, that the earthly one will not be united to Christ in heaven, but will be on the earth when the Lord reigns.<a name=217:7></a> The Lord being now rejected, a saint must either be connected with the world and the order of things here, or he is dissociated from man

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The difference between this present time and the millennium is very distinct.<a name=218:3></a> The Lord is not reigning now, but He will reign then.<a name=218:4></a> The saint now is joined to the Lord, and is one Spirit with Him.<a name=218:5></a> This embraces a great deal, and if this point of difference be really and truly admitted, all the others will follow as a consequence.<a name=218:6></a> If I am united to Christ, He is my life; "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and of death" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:2">Romans  8:2</a>).<a name=218:7></a> I am not only born again, which is true of every saint (see <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:3">John  3:3</a> - 12), but I am enjoying another life through the Holy Spirit, and this could not be without distinct and positive deliverance from the man in the flesh, so that "in that I now live in flesh, I live by faith, the faith of the Son of God, who has loved me and given himself for me" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:20">Galatians  2:20</a>).<a name=218:8></a> Here I am dead, and my life is hid with Christ in God.<a name=218:9></a> The millennial saint will live here on earth; he is not united to Christ, he is not dead, he is a man living in all the commandments and ordinances of the law blameless.<a name=218:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As united to Christ, I have Christ living in me.<a name=218:11></a> I am to live <i>in Him</i> who is not here <i>in the place</i> where He is not, but in order that I may be able to do this, I am united to Him where He is.<a name=218:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This then is a great difference -- the heavenly saint has a perfect sense of complete deliverance from the man in the flesh; while the millennial saint is through grace empowered to do what God required

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The heavenly saint is not below this in walk, but he is greatly beyond it, and if he be not, he is, as I have said, worse off than a millennial saint, because he is now where Christ is not present, nor reigning.<a name=219:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, the way into the holiest of all is now made manifest.<a name=219:4></a> We -- the heavenly saints -- have "boldness for entering into the holy of holies by the blood of Jesus, the new and living way which he has dedicated for us through the veil, that is, his flesh" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:19">Hebrews  10:19</a>, 20).<a name=219:5></a> The earthly saint, though cleansed from his sins by the blood, cannot speak of being inside the veil, because his economy or dispensation is connected with this earth.<a name=219:6></a> If we admit that our place as worshippers is inside the veil, we must admit another great difference between a heavenly and an earthly saint.<a name=219:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One more difference I would notice: the saint united to Christ in heaven, knowing perfect deliverance in Him, and worshipping in the holiest of all, has a place in heaven prepared for him by Christ, which the earthly saint could never speak of.<a name=219:8></a> True he can speak of knowing the Lord of heaven and earth, and eventually he will be in the new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness, when all things are made new; but he cannot speak of having a place prepared for him in the Father's house, and still less can he speak of being raised up together with Christ

	<div class="paragraph">
		now, and made to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.<a name=220:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus we see there are four great differences in doctrine between the heavenly and the earthly saint:<ul><li><i>Firstly</i>, the connection with Christ is different, the saints during His rejection being united to Him, a privilege not known by, or granted to, any other class of saints, neither to the saints before His first advent, nor to the saints after His return.<a name=220:2></a> </li><li><i>Secondly</i>, the deliverance is different because the saints united to Him are in Him, and He is their life.<a name=220:3></a> </li><li><i>Thirdly</i>, the worship is different; the saint in perfect deliverance is inside the veil.<a name=220:4></a> </li><li><i>Fourthly</i>, while the saints before the coming of Christ had a heavenly outlook (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:13">Hebrews  11:13</a> - 16), the saint of our day not only knows that Jesus has prepared a place for him in heaven, but he knows too, that by the Spirit of God he is there, in Him through faith; now, with regard to the millennial saint, his hope and position are simply earthly.<a name=220:5></a> </li></ul>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we admit these differences between the three classes of saints (and I apprehend they cannot be denied), it is evident that any saint who now loses sight of his calling as a heavenly one, will be weak in his soul as to all these blessings which I have spoken of -- namely, his union with Christ, his perfect deliverance, the true worship, and the place -- the Canaan given him of God.<a name=220:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All the saints are set upon the earth, but each of the three classes is called to a very distinct and peculiar relation to it.<a name=220:7></a> The Old Testament saint found that
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=221>[Page 221]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the prospect of heaven was the relief from the confusion and evil here; the millennial saint will be able to enjoy everything here, because the power of evil will be restrained, and the Lord will reign.<a name=221:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence it remains that the saints on the earth during the absence of Christ should not be of it, but having received greater blessings, should walk here during His absence studying only to be like Him whom men refused, and to be unlike those who refused Him.<a name=221:2></a> The snare is that because they are forgiven their sins and have been relieved of the fear of judgment, they turn to the earth, and expect favours from God in connection with it; and when they do, they practically surrender the great truths which distinguish them from the earthly saints, and they are necessarily low in practice because low in doctrine.<a name=221:3></a> They fail in testimony and are, according to the light and opportunity which they have not answered to, subjected to chastening; for "our God is a consuming fire" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:29">Hebrews  12:29</a>), and His "jealousy is cruel as Sheol" (<a href="../bible/SongsofSongs.htm#8:6">Songs of Songs  8:6</a>).<a name=221:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		After the church of God had been formed by the descent of the Spirit of God, the first converts were the three thousand (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:41">Acts  2:41</a>), who were brought to repentance by the preaching of Peter on the day of Pentecost.<a name=222:2></a> Of them it is said: "they <i>continued</i> stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers" (verse 42, Authorised Version); also that, "<i>continuing</i> daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart" (verse, Authorised Version).<a name=222:3></a> While a good start is most essential, its reality is proved by <br>CONTINUING, <br>for conversion is but the <i>beginning</i> of a life for God and His glory.<a name=222:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		From the outset, the great impression that is given is that those who have believed in Christ should be enlarged in the apprehension of the truth and in their enjoyment.<a name=222:5></a> Perseverance in the path and privileges of Christianity is the normal thought for every believer, for the word says, "if he draw back, my soul does not take pleasure in him" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:38">Hebrews  10:38</a>).<a name=222:6></a>

		It is significant that this first case should emphasise the <i>walk</i> of a believer, for the importance of this cannot be over-estimated; seeing that it includes all his conduct from the moment of his conversion to his home-going.<a name=223:9></a> The epistle to the Ephesians, while developing the great truths of Christianity, refers also seven times to the subject, in order that there should be maintained a consistency of conduct

		I draw your attention for a moment to the necessity in regard of the saints at Corinth, that the apostle should recall their attention particularly to the Passover at the outset of his epistle.<a name=237:4></a> He says, "our passover, Christ, has been sacrificed" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5:7">1 Corinthians  5:7</a>).<a name=237:5></a> Was there ever such a Passover?<a name=237:6></a> Paul does not bring it to bear upon them simply to make a distinction between it and the Supper, but in order that their hearts might be freshly exercised as to the bearing of the feast on themselves.<a name=237:7></a> He says, "let us celebrate the feast .<a name=237:8></a>.<a name=237:9></a>.<a name=237:10></a> with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth" (verse 8).<a name=237:11></a> Whether in respect of the Lord Himself or in respect of one another, as bound up together with the Lord and His interests, may we be exercised that in all our goings, in all our thoughts of the saints in secret, or when together, and in our prayers for those who are precious to the Lord, that all might be

		The hour of the Passover had drawn near, and there is an inquiry on the part of the disciples as to the keeping of it, but the institution of the Supper came in distinctly outside the inquiry of the disciples, it came from the Lord Himself.<a name=240:1></a> It was not their request or desire that initiated it.<a name=240:2></a> Who could have taken them off the ground of the Passover, bound up with their affections as it was, but the Lord Himself?<a name=240:3></a> Sweetly the Lord served them in taking their hearts outside of Judaism and all connected with it.<a name=240:4></a> The truth as we know it will make us free.<a name=240:5></a> "If therefore the Son shall set you free, ye shall be really free" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#8:36">John  8:36</a>).<a name=240:6></a> The Lord knew what those disciples needed, in regard of Judaism, and He took their heart with Himself on to new ground in the institution of the Supper.<a name=240:7></a> I connect the two morally.<a name=240:8></a> What the Lord used for the institution of the Supper was provided for the commemoration of the Passover -- the bread and the wine.<a name=240:9></a> The bread and the cup speak to us of the body and blood of Christ.<a name=240:10></a> The cup also speaks of the love of God.<a name=240:11></a> But I am speaking on this occasion of the Supper not only as the Lord's provision, but of the conditions which the Lord would have on our side in fidelity to Him.<a name=240:12></a>

		Then in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#8">Acts  8</a>an account is given of the conversion of the Ethiopian eunuch, who was enlightened by Philip preaching unto him Jesus.<a name=244:2></a> Of him it is said (verse ), after that Philip baptised him, that "he went on his way REJOICING".<a name=244:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is a true and beautiful feature of a young convert.<a name=244:4></a> Filled with joy and peace in believing, through the power of the Holy Spirit, he is able to go on his way, a living witness to the joy that the knowledge of God, as revealed in Jesus, gives to those who have received the Holy Spirit.<a name=244:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		No other name or power could effect this.<a name=244:6></a> Bitter sorrow and despair must sooner or later fill the hearts of the Christ-less, but the youngest convert can be filled with that deep and lasting joy which evidences the greatness of the triumph of God by the gospel.<a name=244:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The newly-found joy of a young convert is the counterpart of the joy which fills the heart of the Shepherd, as He says, "Rejoice with me, for I have found my lost sheep" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15:6">Luke  15:6</a>).<a name=244:8></a> A joyless believer is a denial to the true character Christianity.<a name=244:9></a>

		Then came in that distinguished convert, Saul of Tarsus, of whom it is said in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9">Acts  9</a>that "rising up was baptised .<a name=244:10></a>.<a name=244:11></a>.<a name=244:12></a> and he was <i>with the disciples</i> who were in Damascus certain days.<a name=244:13></a> And straightway .<a name=244:14></a>.<a name=244:15></a>.<a name=244:16></a> he preached Jesus that <i>he</i> is the Son of God" (verses 18 - 20).<a name=244:17></a> Soon after that he "assayed to join himself to

		disciples" at Jerusalem (verse 26), and was "<i>with them</i> coming in and going out" (verse 28).<a name=245:1></a> Very early in his history he found the value of <br>ASSEMBLING <br>with the disciples of the Lord.<a name=245:2></a> He found that those who loved the Lord Jesus were the only companions with whom he could happily assemble.<a name=245:3></a> What a remarkable commencement this was for one who was to be such a devoted servant of Christ and of His assembly, and to whom was to be entrusted the unfolding of the great truths of the assembly.<a name=245:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord Jesus had taught His disciples to assemble and in resurrection, during His forty days He had "assembled with them" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:4">Acts  1:4</a>).<a name=245:5></a> It is indispensable for spiritual prosperity that those who love Christ should be found together and "not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:25">Hebrews  10:25</a>) was an important injunction given by this same convert in later life.<a name=245:6></a> Everyone needs the companionship, support, and encouragement of his fellow Christians, and it is when gathered together "in assembly" that the Lord is pleased to manifest Himself to His own and to give them distinctive blessing and ministry.<a name=245:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When a great number had believed and turned to the Lord in Antioch, and Barnabas came from Jerusalem, he "exhorted all with purpose of heart to abide with the Lord".<a name=245:8></a> As it is said that "the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch", it is evident, from the name that was given to them, that they gave heed to that exhortation, and were CLEAVING TO THE LORD
	</div>

		<a name=246>[Page 246]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		or abiding with Him.<a name=246:1></a> It is significant that, flowing from this, "a large crowd of people were added to the Lord" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#11:22">Acts  11:22</a> - 26).<a name=246:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How important it is that every young convert should have purpose of <i>heart</i>, that with fervent affection he might cleave to Him and thus be maintained in holiness and separation from evil.<a name=246:3></a> The idolater cleaves to his idols, the pleasure-lover to his pleasures, the miser to his money; but those who are truly converted to God will cleave with affection and earnest desire in faithfulness to the Lord, whom they trust, love, and serve.<a name=246:4></a> Thus stability of purpose and walk are produced, and, as Christ-like characteristics shine out, the name of Christian is a true designation.<a name=246:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What beautiful features were seen in Lydia, who was a valuable sister in the church at Philippi.<a name=246:6></a> She was a worshipper of God, and of her it was said, "whose heart the Lord opened to attend to the things spoken by Paul" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16:14">Acts  16:14</a>).<a name=246:7></a> This characteristic of <br>ATTENDING TO THE MINISTRY <br>which the Lord is giving, through His servants, is an important one, and it is especially necessary in this day, when the inspiration and authority of the Holy Scriptures, and particularly of the writings of the apostle Paul, are being refuted or ignored, that the youngest believer should attend or give heed to the things which he has heard, lest at any time he should let them slip, as we are exhorted in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:1">Hebrews  2:1</a>.<a name=246:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The spirit of Lydia was very commendable, too, for "when she had been baptised and her house, she
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=247>[Page 247]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there".<a name=247:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle so greatly appreciated Lydia's spirituality, that when he and Silas went out of prison they "came to Lydia" (verse 40), thus expressing their approval of her fidelity.<a name=247:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is interesting to observe that the elect lady, to whom John wrote, was warned against any who did not bring the doctrine of Christ.<a name=247:3></a> The apostle said, "do <i>not</i> receive him into the house" (<a href="../bible/2John.htm#10">2 John  10</a>).<a name=247:4></a> Doubtless these two sisters were well able to keep house, for Lydia knew whom to <i>receive</i> and the elect lady whom to <i>refuse</i>.<a name=247:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One of the most remarkable converts was the keeper of the prison at Philippi, who, having been converted at midnight, took Paul and Silas "the same hour of the night and washed them from their stripes; and was baptised, he and all his straightway.<a name=247:6></a> And having brought them into his house he laid the table for them, and rejoiced" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16:33">Acts  16:33</a>, 34).<a name=247:7></a> He thus began <br>MINISTERING TO THE LORD <br>by caring for His servants and proving, by this marvellous transformation, how real was the work of God in him, for he now had affection and consideration for the very men whom he had treated so cruelly but a few hours before.<a name=247:8></a> The spirit of service is imparted to every true believer, and it is delightful to see it in evidence early in a believer's history.<a name=247:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The transforming effect of the gospel is one of its

		most beautiful features.<a name=248:1></a> New affections, instincts, and a new spirit are implanted, and manifest themselves in those who are converted, so that the graces of Christ appear where the works of the flesh only were in evidence.<a name=248:2></a> The exhortation is of great moment, "be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12:2">Romans  12:2</a>).<a name=248:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Yet another feature which is essential for spiritual prosperity is developed in the converts in Berea, of whom it was said that "these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, receiving the word with all readiness of mind, daily searching the scriptures if these things were so" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#17:11">Acts  17:11</a>).<a name=248:4></a> Great importance must be attached to <br>SEARCHING THE SCRIPTURES <br>daily, for it is a necessary spiritual habit to develop.<a name=248:5></a> No one will prosper if the Scriptures are neglected, and the full benefit of ministry can only be gained as it is tested and verified by the Scriptures; hence the exhortation, "prove all things, hold fast the right" (<a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#5:21">1 Thessalonians  5:21</a>).<a name=248:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is recorded of these Bereans that "many from among them believed" (verse 12).<a name=248:7></a> Doubts would be dispelled, difficulties cleared, and converts confirmed if the Scriptures were diligently searched in prayerful dependence upon the Holy Spirit daily, for the word has authority and carries its own credentials.<a name=248:8></a> There would be less unbelief and scepticism if the Bible were <i>searched</i> more.<a name=248:9></a> Its choicest treasures are hidden below the surface, and therefore searching

		We have already taken account of the sovereign right of God to enter into the circumstances of an individual and change them in order to secure His end in the person concerned.<a name=249:6></a> The same principle, however, operates in the history of the children of God, viewed in their collective setting in the journey through the wilderness.<a name=249:7></a> Thus, in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#9">Numbers  9</a>, we have remarkably set out the divine right to direct the movements of the camp of Israel, which for us would indicate the divine right to direct the movements of the saints in relation to features of the truth.<a name=249:8></a> The divine presence is beautifully set out here in the cloud by day and the appearance of fire by night.<a name=249:9></a> How thankful we should be for any impression we have of God amongst His people, despite all the weakness and failure we may have to acknowledge on our side!<a name=249:10></a> We should be concerned that there should always be conditions amongst the people of God that will secure the divine presence; for as God is amongst His people, He Himself directs the course of His own testimony, as is suggested in the cloud lifting.<a name=249:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The journeyings of the people through the wilderness were a matter of divine indication.<a name=250:1></a> <i>God</i> chose the time when the camp should move, and the details that are given show that the children of Israel could never tell when God might see fit to change the circumstances of the camp.<a name=250:2></a> Sometimes it was a long period, the cloud resting on the tabernacle several days: but they waited.<a name=250:3></a> We can afford to wait when God does not indicate a move, but we can never afford to wait when He <i>does</i> indicate a move.<a name=250:4></a> They might have only arrived at an encampment one evening, and the next morning the cloud was lifted.<a name=250:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If there are matters like that in the course of the testimony, do I say, 'Well, we have only just had a move', or, 'We would rather settle down'?<a name=250:6></a> But God is asserting His sovereign right to change the circumstances of His people as identified with His testimony.<a name=250:7></a> He has surrendered the leadership of His people to no one.<a name=250:8></a> We can be more than thankful for the principle of leadership amongst the people of God, but basically leadership is in God Himself.<a name=250:9></a> He may raise up any vessel, and we do well to respect and recognise fully any vessel whom God may use: but, be that as it may, leadership basically is in God, and if we give that up we shall depart from the pathway of faith.<a name=250:10></a> In the exercising of His leadership God has a right to change circumstances in the wilderness, and He has no need to give an account to any as to why He is indicating a move.<a name=250:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We need thus to recognize where God is in matters, and if He is indicating a move in the course of the testimony, let us be ready.<a name=251:8></a> The blessed Spirit, as being with us, will help us to discern whether it is a movement of the camp.<a name=251:9></a> There have been many encampments, many changes in the course of the testimony when God has indicated that certain things were to be changed, certain viewpoints of the truth were to be freshly considered; and the people of God have recognized the operations of the Spirit and the sovereign right of God to change the circumstances of the testimony, so that the truth is viewed from another aspect.<a name=251:10></a> As we are ready for this we shall be found journeying in relation to the mind of God and preserved in life in the midst of wilderness conditions.<a name=251:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is also instructive to consider God's ways of government in the world.<a name=252:1></a> In <a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#21:27">Ezekiel  21:27</a> we have the expression, "I will overturn, overturn, overturn it!<a name=252:2></a>" This is God speaking, and He is asserting His sovereign right to intervene in the course of men in relation to the government of the world.<a name=252:3></a> We know that this section alludes to God allowing His people to go into captivity; the reference to the wicked prince would allude to king Zedekiah, of whom we read in <a href="../bible/2Chronicles.htm#36:13">2 Chronicles  36:13</a> that he stiffened his neck and hardened his heart against Jehovah.<a name=252:4></a> Despite the speaking of Jeremiah, there was a refusal to hear the word of God, and Zedekiah was not ready for God to enter into the circumstances and change them, and he was governmentally dealt with in a very humbling manner.<a name=252:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But Ezekiel uses the circumstances to bring out that whatever may transpire in connection with one nation -- here it would be the breakdown of Israel as the seat of God's government -- God is changing the government to bring in the times of the nations, and he introduces the expression, "I will overturn, overturn, overturn it .<a name=252:6></a>.<a name=252:7></a>.<a name=252:8></a> until he come whose right it is".<a name=252:9></a> That is Christ!<a name=252:10></a> In relation to all that is transpiring on earth at the present time, God is overturning continually to make way for Christ: it is a great comfort to think of that!<a name=252:11></a> Things have never got out of the divine control, and God is balancing the nations in all their threatening might; and we can count on Him to keep His hand in divine balance over things, all making way for the coming in of Christ.<a name=252:12></a>

		We have seen men in our day who have sought to exercise dictatorial power, and God has overturned them one after another.<a name=253:1></a> He has overturned nations, and He is holding His hand on the balance of power among the nations of the world because of the divine intent that all should finally be placed in the hands of Christ.<a name=253:2></a> We have the light of that in our souls: what restful persons it should make us!<a name=253:3></a> Many all around are perplexed as to what is happening; threatening powers and fearful weapons are tending to distress; but let us think of God, in the supremacy that always marks Him, overturning everything to make way for Christ.<a name=253:4></a> He is holding all under His own hand, changing the circumstances time and time again, allowing one nation to come up, allowing one to oppress, and then coming in governmentally with His own divine control.<a name=253:5></a>

		We are all far too prone to accept the cross as the ground of escape from all the consequences of our sins, and of full acceptance with God, and, at the same time, refuse it as the ground of our complete separation from the world.<a name=254:4></a> True it is, thanks and praise be to our God, the solid ground of our deliverance from guilt and consequent condemnation; but it is more than this.<a name=254:5></a> It has severed us, for ever, from all that pertains to this world, through which we are passing.<a name=254:6></a> Are my sins put away?<a name=254:7></a> Yes; blessed be the God of all grace!<a name=254:8></a> According to what?<a name=254:9></a> According to the perfection of Christ's atoning sacrifice as estimated by God Himself.<a name=254:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I desire, as the Lord may enable me, to speak in a very plain and practical way in connection with the scripture we have read, especially from verse 19.<a name=257:1></a> This scripture is, perhaps, familiar to most here; but we are not here to give instruction exactly or any further light.<a name=257:2></a> Many of us take credit to ourselves in connection with our familiarity with the <i>letter</i> of Scripture, and it is in reference to those scriptures with which we are familiar that we need stirring up and exercise of soul.<a name=257:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Our desire is to speak to you in connection with this scripture in a practical way.<a name=257:4></a> If you have come expecting some great unfolding of doctrine you will be disappointed; but I trust the Lord will give us just the word that He can use for our real spiritual help.<a name=257:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It has been conceded for a long time in connection with this scripture that it is the one scripture the Lord has given us to mark out the path for us in the midst of what we speak of as 'the ruin'.<a name=257:6></a> I do not want to speak much about the ruin; it is not well to be too much occupied with it -- I am sure the Lord would have us sensible as to the conditions that obtain on every hand, but I think there is a danger of becoming too much occupied with it, and that is not for our spiritual profit.<a name=257:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Whatever ruin has come in, you will always find it is connected with the responsibility of man: but in this second epistle of Paul to Timothy, from the outset

	<div class="paragraph">
		of it, we are brought face-to-face with the purpose of God; and that is beyond the ruin.<a name=258:1></a> The effectuation -- the accomplishment of God's purpose is in His hands -- He "works all things according to the counsel of his own will" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:11">Ephesians  1:11</a>); there is no danger of defeat or frustration or failure in that.<a name=258:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think, generally speaking, the two epistles of Paul to Timothy indicate in the beginning a certain difference.<a name=258:3></a> The apostle in the first epistle connects his apostleship with the commandment of our Saviour God; you will find there is a largeness about it -- "all men" are in view.<a name=258:4></a> But when you come to the second epistle he connects his apostleship with the purpose of God, and in a certain sense things are more limited -- it is not "all men" -- "the elect" come into view.<a name=258:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I want you to see is this, that from the beginning of this epistle you breathe the air of the purpose of God.<a name=258:6></a> Take what I have read: there is the allusion to Hymenaeus and Philetus -- they are only sample men -- "of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus; men who as to the truth have gone astray", and we get their teaching and the effect of their teaching; they were overthrowing the faith of some.<a name=258:7></a> But the next expression stands like a solid, immovable rock, and the waves of error only dash themselves into spray as they strike it: "the firm foundation of God stands".<a name=258:8></a> It stands steady, and as you touch it spiritually it will impart to your soul its own steadiness; <i>you</i> will become steady, you will cease shaking.<a name=258:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I would now speak of three words that indicate the points of the truth.<a name=260:3></a> The first word is "depart from" (Authorised Version), or "withdraw"; the second word is "flee"; and the third word is "follow" (Authorised Version), or "pursue"; so that if we answer in any measure to this instruction, these three things will characterise us.<a name=260:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Withdraw" is a quiet word; it is not to make any fuss or any display about it; the thing is to <i>do</i> it.<a name=260:5></a> I cite as an illustration <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#15:16">Jeremiah  15:16</a>, showing what the force of "withdraw" is, where the prophet says, "Thy words were found, and I did eat them, and thy words were unto me the joy and rejoicing of my heart; for I am called by thy name, O Jehovah, God of hosts".<a name=260:6></a> What is the next word?<a name=260:7></a> He <i>withdrew</i>: "I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor exulted: I sat alone" (verse 17).<a name=260:8></a> Now it was not the fact of eating Jehovah's words that brought him into trouble -- that made him very happy, when he discovered that he was called by the name of Jehovah.<a name=260:9></a> To be called by the name of another in Scripture is identification.<a name=260:10></a> But it was not that which brought Jeremiah into trouble, it was <i>withdrawing</i>.<a name=260:11></a> Are you prepared to go through any trouble on account of the Lord, on account of refusing that which compromises His honour and glory?<a name=260:12></a> Jeremiah withdrew very quietly, "I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor exulted: I sat alone because of thy hand; for thou hast filled me with indignation".<a name=260:13></a>

		A man may be very indignant and very happy at the same time.<a name=261:1></a> Jeremiah was happy in the apprehension of his identification with Jehovah, God of hosts; but that assembly of mockers filled him with indignation.<a name=261:2></a> Have you ever "sat alone"?<a name=261:3></a> I speak plainly, but it is taken so easy nowadays.<a name=261:4></a> People are found in the <i>position</i> of separation, but how did they get there?<a name=261:5></a> Perhaps very easily, without exercise.<a name=261:6></a> Did you ever "sit <i>alone</i>"?<a name=261:7></a> It is a real thing.<a name=261:8></a> You have withdrawn from iniquity and you "sit alone".<a name=261:9></a> Some of us hardly know how to appreciate good company when we get it, and it is because we have never "sat alone".<a name=261:10></a>

		There is first the withdrawing, you separate yourself from the vessels to dishonour, and then there is a word for you personally, not in regard to your associations with others, but in regard to <i>yourself</i>, "But youthful lusts <i>flee</i>".<a name=261:11></a> And there are four things you are to <i>pursue</i> -- righteousness, faith, love, peace.<a name=261:12></a> You are still addressed individually -- you are individual up to this point; you are not in any fellowship.<a name=261:13></a> Till you reach this point you are not <i>ready</i> for fellowship according to God.<a name=261:14></a> You may say, I belong to such and such a meeting.<a name=261:15></a> That is a poor thing, and you will prove it so.<a name=261:16></a> When you follow righteousness, faith, love, peace, your privilege is to follow these things <i>with</i> those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart.<a name=261:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first paragraph, "in Christ Jesus" is the characteristic phrase, and the characteristic phrase of the second paragraph is "the Lord".<a name=262:11></a> Now "in Christ Jesus" stands for privilege; but "the Lord" stands for responsibility.<a name=262:12></a> The Holy Spirit speaking of "the Lord" says, "Let every one who names the name of the Lord withdraw from iniquity".<a name=262:13></a> This should have such an effect on us, it should evoke such a response from us, that we would never rest until we had <i>withdrawn</i>.<a name=262:14></a>

		I take you back for a moment to the beginning of the chapter.<a name=263:4></a> Paul in writing to Timothy says, "Thou therefore, my child" (verse 1); that is a word which implies two things, relationship and affection, so that Paul uses it as a term of endearment to Timothy, for there was peculiar affection between them -- "Thou therefore, my child, be strong in the grace which is in Christ Jesus".<a name=263:5></a> I think when you get Christ Jesus mentioned alone it is <i>that</i> Person, it is <i>that</i> anointed Man.<a name=263:6></a> Peter said at the close of his discourse at Pentecost that God had raised up Jesus and had made Him Lord and Christ (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:36">Acts  2:36</a>).<a name=263:7></a> I think when you get Christ Jesus alone you get Him as the risen and exalted Man -- the Man that God has anointed; but when that little word "in" is attached, what do you get then?<a name=263:8></a> The thought is not the grace that met me as a poor guilty, lost sinner; I do not mean that there are different sorts of grace; it is all the grace of God, but it is not grace in that point of view; neither is it the administration of grace to you as a believer in connection with your responsible life here -- in your weakness, your circumstances, all that may come upon you, that is <i>not</i> the thought of "grace which is in Christ Jesus".<a name=263:9></a>

		I think one of the greatest tests we have to face today is the matter of faith.<a name=290:8></a> When so much that we (some of us who are older, at least), have relied on, and thought so much of, has been stripped away, what we are left with are the essentials of Christianity -- our link with Christ as Saviour; the knowledge of the presence and power of the Holy Spirit; and the truth of the mystery.<a name=290:9></a> God is still continuing with His great thoughts which are wrapped up in the mystery.<a name=290:10></a> And so the Lord says, "Woman, believe me".<a name=290:11></a> Now it raises the question as to what do we really see in the testimony?<a name=290:12></a> What do we see as we come together and speak of the truth?<a name=290:13></a> Do we see only small numbers and weakness?<a name=290:14></a> or, does this word come into operation

		Now, we might say, That is so, but it is rather abstract; but what I would plead for is this, when we come together at the Supper, there it is -- I do not say the assembly in a place, but what is there is an expression of what is proper to the assembly, "when ye come together in assembly" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:18">1 Corinthians  11:18</a>).<a name=293:12></a> We come together to remember the Lord Jesus, and it is right that we should.<a name=293:13></a> But I believe we should consider not only what <i>we</i> find at the Supper (for we

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That makes the Supper very important.<a name=294:3></a> You say, Is it important to us?<a name=294:4></a> Indeed it is, because we need it, and we have long been taught that it is food for the wilderness, and so it is.<a name=294:5></a> One thing that has impressed me recently as to the Supper is its sheer simplicity; it is not elaborate, there is no ritual connected with it.<a name=294:6></a> The loaf is before us, and a brother gives thanks for it.<a name=294:7></a> As to the loaf, Paul reminds us that it represents the body of Christ, every blood-bought saint (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10:17">1 Corinthians  10:17</a>).<a name=294:8></a> But what then?<a name=294:9></a> The loaf is broken so that we may partake of it.<a name=294:10></a> The blessings that the loaf speaks of do not become available to us until we accept the fact that these blessings come to us only because Jesus died.<a name=294:11></a>

		The Lord comes in on the basis of His own words, "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#14:18">John  14:18</a>).<a name=295:3></a> Now I pause here.<a name=295:4></a> We are not here to talk about imaginative things, what we speak of is divine truth given in the power of the Holy Spirit, set out in Scripture, and borne witness to by saints.<a name=295:5></a> The Lord comes in and He brings the atmosphere of heaven with Him.<a name=295:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I stress this because there is always the fear that we resort to what is imaginative and not of God.<a name=295:7></a> What is being said, I believe, <i>is</i> of God, and given by the Spirit of God.<a name=295:8></a> The Lord comes in and makes Himself known, He gives us a touch of His own presence, and what appears is the shining of His glory.<a name=295:9></a> You could not be in the Lord's presence without gaining some sense of the greatness of Who was there.<a name=295:10></a> Scripture speaks of "looking on the glory of the Lord, with unveiled face" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#3:18">2 Corinthians  3:18</a>), the shining is there, and we see it by the Spirit.<a name=295:11></a> And what happens?<a name=295:12></a> -- the affections of the saints are drawn to one Man and what comes out is assembly affection.<a name=295:13></a> What a fine thing that is!<a name=295:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		These things are very real, and, I believe, the Lord takes up what He finds, and that is the point of this scripture: "having found one pearl of great value, he went and sold all whatever he had and bought it".<a name=295:15></a> Now, that was once, that was historical.<a name=295:16></a>

		Now, as I have said, there is one simple thought which I would like to bring before you, and that is that in each of these incidents we have read together, the Spirit of God would impress us with the fact that God is waiting upon each one of His people in order to add to them in a spiritual way.<a name=300:2></a> In the gospel of Matthew it is said in chapter 26: 21, "And as they were eating he said, Verily I say to you, that one of you shall deliver me up", and then again in verse 26, "And as they were eating, Jesus, having taken the bread and blessed, broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat: this is my body".<a name=300:3></a> In the one case it is as they were eating that the Lord Jesus announced that one of them should betray Him.<a name=300:4></a> Jesus said, "Verily I say to you, that one of you shall deliver me up".<a name=300:5></a> It is then that the news is broken to the company of this act of treachery that was to mark Judas.<a name=300:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, when we think of that for a moment in the light of what the apostle says to the saints at Corinth, we are reminded that it was on the same night in which the Lord Jesus was betrayed that He took bread (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:23">1 Corinthians  11:23</a>).<a name=300:7></a> But what I desire to emphasise here is the reference to the Passover (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#12">Exodus  12</a>) and the appropriation of the death of Christ in its passover character.<a name=300:8></a> It is the great basic type of the death of Christ, what one would speak of as the great fundamental

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But what is before me is to impress upon our hearts that the Lord is waiting upon His people.<a name=301:4></a> Think of His patience; how He is waiting upon each one of us to minister to us.<a name=301:5></a> We find in this connection it is said, "as they were eating, Jesus, having taken the bread".<a name=301:6></a> One would desire to challenge our hearts whether we have appropriated the death of Christ in its passover character.<a name=301:7></a> Have our souls fed on the love of Christ as the One who bore the holy judgment of God?<a name=301:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think we must all have observed in the record given us in Matthew, that the Spirit of God emphasises the fact that the Lord Jesus blessed the bread, that is, He invested that symbol with a divine meaning to our souls.<a name=301:9></a> We have all come to recognise in those holy symbols that they are the emblems to us of the precious body and blood of the Lord, and we find that it is as they were eating, as they were appropriating the passover, that the Lord instituted the Supper; it is set in that connection.<a name=301:10></a> We read, "as they were eating, Jesus, having taken the bread and blessed, broke it and gave it to the disciples".<a name=301:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What one would further observe in connection with this is that the whole power of the liberation of the christian company lies in the drinking of that cup.<a name=302:4></a> These disciples had been connected with a religious system of things, and the Lord would liberate their spirits and set them free as they drink of the cup.<a name=302:5></a> It is to be noted that it is from that point it is recorded, "And having sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives".<a name=302:6></a> As we drink of that cup, it unfolds before us the great privilege accorded to the assembly, for we read that they passed from that point into the spiritual region, the mount of Olives suggesting the region of the Spirit.<a name=302:7></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I turn now to the passage in <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#10">Mark  10</a>, and what we see there is that it is said of the disciples that "they were in the way going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was going on before them; and they were amazed, and were afraid as they followed".<a name=303:7></a> Now, in each of the gospels a certain way is put before us.<a name=303:8></a> In Matthew we have the way of righteousness opened up to us, and the Lord is presented there as the One who leads in the way of righteousness.<a name=303:9></a> In Luke it is the way of wisdom, and as we tread the paths of wisdom the Lord would say to each one of us, I will "cause those that love me to inherit substance" (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#8:21">Proverbs  8:21</a>).<a name=303:10></a> But when we come to John it is the way of love that is presented to us; it is the way of surpassing excellence that is put before us, and if we follow the Lord we see that way of love.<a name=303:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Mark's gospel it is not the way of righteousness, nor the way of wisdom, nor the way of love that is opened up, but the way of suffering.<a name=303:12></a> We have been often reminded that Mark is the gospel that has peculiar relation to suffering; it is the gospel in

		which we get the most precious details in regard of the sufferings of the Lord Jesus Christ; and the priestly way in which he dwells upon the features of the Lord's holy sufferings commands the reverent worship and adoration of all our hearts.<a name=304:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So we get here, "they were in the way", that is, in the way of suffering.<a name=304:2></a> Some of us have been considering the sufferings of the apostle Paul, who was the greatest vessel of suffering next to the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=304:3></a> The Lord comes before us, as we have seen, as the great Vessel of suffering, and here it says of the disciples, "they were in the way".<a name=304:4></a> I would like to challenge each one here as to whether, if the Lord searched each of our hearts, we should be found following "in the way".<a name=304:5></a> Matthew would test us as to whether we are eating, but Mark would challenge us as to whether we are "in the way".<a name=304:6></a> We may have taken up the holy service of the Lord Jesus Christ; we may be active in that service, but, brethren, the Lord would ask each one of us here, Are you "in the way"?<a name=304:7></a> Are we prepared for the way of suffering?<a name=304:8></a> Paul's word to Timothy was that he was to take his share in suffering (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:3">2 Timothy  2:3</a>).<a name=304:9></a> One feels how one's heart has often shrunk from this -- from this way of suffering.<a name=304:10></a> We cannot enter upon this path lightly.<a name=304:11></a>

		You will remember the young man in this gospel who sought to follow the Lord, and that no sooner had he put his feet in the way of suffering than he was laid hold of and stripped of his clothing and fled from them naked (chapter 14: 51, 52).<a name=304:12></a> But what a comfort to our hearts it is that though on the one side of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then further, it is said here that as they were following, the Lord "taking the twelve again to him, he began to tell them what was going to happen to him", and, according to the record given in this gospel, He enlarged on the subject of His sufferings.<a name=305:3></a> What a holy subject for all our hearts!<a name=305:4></a> Our souls cannot but be divinely moved as we contemplate the sufferings of Christ, and to think, too, that those holy sufferings should be a subject of teaching.<a name=305:5></a> So the Lord says here, "Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man shall be delivered up to the chief priests and to the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him up to the nations: and they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him; and after three days he shall rise again".<a name=305:6></a> One feels that if there is to be true Levitical service in the house of God, it is absolutely essential that our feet should be in the way of suffering, and that the Lord Jesus should be our Teacher, unveiling His sufferings to our hearts so that we are prepared for the path, as it is said of the disciples, "And they were in the way".<a name=305:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What a source of consolation it is that His treading the path of suffering brings into view the light of the resurrection world.<a name=305:8></a> Whatever the suffering may be, the Lord sheds upon the way of suffering the

		We see all through how God was for them, which is the objective; on the other hand, we see how few answered to His grace with experimental ability to enjoy it, which is the subjective.<a name=308:2></a> It may be reasoned here that man had not then received the Spirit, and therefore was not able to answer to God's purpose; still we see very plainly how God expected a practical course corresponding to His grace.<a name=308:3></a> If we study the prophets we see how Israel failed to answer to the grace of God; the objective was perfect, and continued, though at times there was no subjective, no answer to it in the people.<a name=308:4></a> The great plaint in the prophet Isaiah was, "What was there yet to do to my vineyard that I have not done in it?<a name=308:5></a> Wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?<a name=308:6></a>" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#5:4">Isaiah  5:4</a>).<a name=308:7></a> Again, in Jeremiah the Lord says, "my people have committed two evils: they have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, to hew them out cisterns, broken cisterns that hold no water" (<a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#2:13">Jeremiah  2:13</a>).<a name=308:8></a>

		Spirit of God, that you may not only know that God is for you, but that you may have the nature and ability to be a witness of His grace through His Spirit dwelling in you; so that it is not by any attempt of your own, or by introspection, that you answer to His grace, but by His Spirit who makes it true to you, that it is, "I am crucified with Christ, and no longer live, <i>I</i>, but Christ lives in me" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:20">Galatians  2:20</a>).<a name=309:1></a> The objective and the subjective should be combined in every believer, and thus he would be an imitator of God as a dear child of His (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:1">Ephesians  5:1</a>).<a name=309:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But Christendom has departed from the purpose of God, and having no true idea of His grace, there has been the attempt to be subjective according to human ideas, adopting the law as a rule of life; for where the objective is lost, the subjective must be imperfect.<a name=309:3></a> Hence we see the varied attempts in the godly to recover lost ground ending in confusion and extremes; the one contenting themselves that all is done by God, and thus losing sight of the work of the Spirit in us -- the subjective effect on our side; the other ignoring or limiting the objective, or God's purpose for us, and thinking that by persistent doing and religious exercises we may arrive at what will please God.<a name=309:4></a> Not knowing in themselves that the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made them free from the law of sin and death (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:2">Romans  8:2</a>), they try to improve themselves -- to make themselves more fit for the eye of God, instead of seeing that they are before Him "in Christ".<a name=309:5></a>

		the grace of God had conferred all on us, and had become leavened by Judaism, some had zeal though not according to knowledge, in attempting to establish their own righteousness, but did not submit to the righteousness of God; hence the objective being little known (which is true of Christendom to this day), the subjective must be unknown or imperfect.<a name=310:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I must add that when the knowledge of the objective -- the fulness of God's purpose in grace, was restored to the church during this [19th] century, many received it gladly; but the effect on some was that because God had done all for them, there was no claim that they were to be in moral correspondence to it; the purpose of God in grace was accepted, but the work of the Spirit in them to enable them to answer to that purpose was overlooked; consequently instead of commending the greatness of God's grace which they knew objectively, they accepted this knowledge of His grace, without the experimental state that could enjoy it.<a name=310:2></a> This could only result in earthly-mindedness; and in union with Christ not being known and realised, so as to come from Him, and so to maintain His name in heavenly power on the earth.<a name=310:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		No one can read the epistles and John's gospel in the light of the Spirit, without seeing that the great burden of them is that Christ should be formed in the saints, so that they might be able to enter experimentally into God's grace.<a name=310:4></a> If we look at the objective we have everything in Christ, but there is no fruit unless we abide in Him.<a name=310:5></a> In John's epistles the great point

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is all experimental, bringing us into personal acquaintance with the life and power of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=311:7></a> Souls are deceived by separating the subjective from the objective.<a name=311:8></a> God bestows the gift of His grace, and by His Spirit He fits every believer for the enjoyment of His grace.<a name=311:9></a> It is impossible for a person walking in the Spirit not to be in a state to enjoy the grace given, just as the prodigal received the best robe -- Christ, in order to enjoy the great supper.<a name=311:10></a>

		I want to say a word about the house of God as it is presented to us in the gospel of Luke.<a name=331:1></a> Luke has his own way of presenting the truth, as specially fitted of the Lord, and he invariably presents it as in relation to the gospel; that is, he presents the subject in relation to the service of the Lord Jesus Christ as the anointed One, according to chapter 4, for the presentation of the gospel.<a name=331:2></a> He writes, as he tells us, "with method", which is an important feature in ministry.<a name=331:3></a> He says, "it has seemed good to <i>me</i> .<a name=331:4></a>.<a name=331:5></a>.<a name=331:6></a> to write to thee with method, most excellent Theophilus, that thou mightest know the certainty of those things in which thou hast been instructed" (chapter 1: 3, 4).<a name=331:7></a> He brings in households and opens up to us the conditions that existed in these households.<a name=331:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		John, on the other hand, treats more of the family; he is concerned with the derivation of the saints; that is, they are God's children; not so much their public history, what they had been, but their origin, and how they were being educated by the Lord for their place in the Father's house, which He had gone to prepare.<a name=331:9></a> So John says the son abides in the house for ever (chapter 8: 35); he has an eternal thought in mind, whereas Luke is concerned with what is provisional as connected with and supporting the gospel testimony during the period known or spoken of by the Lord, and also by the prophet, as "the acceptable

		year of the Lord" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4:19">Luke  4:19</a>).<a name=332:1></a> Luke, therefore, as I said, deals with households or houses, in which the various heads were responsible, having in view that they should have a part in God's house; in other words, whether it be a parent or child, the thing in view with each of us in household culture and nurture is that we should have part in the house of God as it is set up here provisionally in relation to the gospel.<a name=332:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4">Luke  4</a>we read, that the Lord enters into Simon's house (verse 38), a man who was afterwards to have a very great place in the house of God, and the Lord finds Simon's wife's mother sick of a fever.<a name=332:3></a> He, standing over her, rebukes the fever.<a name=332:4></a> He did not rebuke her, because He was dealing in grace; He rebuked the fever; He would relieve her.<a name=332:5></a> The fever left her, and "forthwith standing up she served them" (verse 39), not only <i>Him</i>, but <i>them</i>.<a name=332:6></a> Now this is an item of importance, and as one might say, the first item of education in view of what the evangelist has in his mind.<a name=332:7></a> We have to learn to be free of the fever, whatever that may be in each case.<a name=332:8></a> It is a common malady spiritually, and we have to be free of it in order to <i>serve</i>; in fact we cannot serve if we are not free, for we have to be <i>served</i>.<a name=332:9></a> Thank God!<a name=332:10></a> there are those who are free of it to serve those who are not, but His thought is that the house should be free of feverish, irritable, complaining persons.<a name=332:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in chapter 5 a man who is a paralytic is brought to the Lord (verse 18); he needed to be served; he was not exactly irritable, but burdensome.<a name=332:12></a> He was
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=333>[Page 333]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		brought to the Lord by sympathetic persons who cared for him.<a name=333:1></a> Luke does not tell us the number of men, it simply says, "men bringing upon a couch"; but Mark says, that there were four (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#2:3">Mark  2:3</a>).<a name=333:2></a> It says he was carried on his "little couch" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#5:19">Luke  5:19</a>), for that is how it should read.<a name=333:3></a> It is a suggestive thought; there was a certain advantage in this man's case in regard to those who had to do with him, the couch was "little"; and the Lord in answering the thoughts and reasonings of His enemies says to the paralytic, "Arise, and take up thy little couch and go to thine house" (verse 24).<a name=333:4></a> The Lord did not rebuke the palsy, neither did He stand over the man, nor did He take his hand; for here it is a question of His authority, the authority of His word, the word of Christ.<a name=333:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As I remarked, the advantage of the little couch is obvious; he was evidently a little man, his circumstances were little, and of course, that has a spiritual meaning.<a name=333:6></a> It is dangerous to be big; even as unconverted, a great man is at a great disadvantage, and certainly a man should not be bigger or greater after conversion than before.<a name=333:7></a> It is not the Lord's intention that His people should spread out like trees in the world; His thought is rather that His people should be reduced in an external way; certainly if they are being educated to have part in the house of God, it is of all moment that they should accept that littleness is the divine thought; not littleness, surely, in a spiritual way; that is another matter, but littleness in regard of human circumstances; there is a great advantage

		in it.<a name=334:1></a> Og, king of Bashan, was a big man and had a very large bed (<a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#3:11">Deuteronomy  3:11</a>); but this man in Luke must have been a little man, for he had a little bed, suggestive of the fact that he was a man of little circumstances, and no doubt for that reason, he came in for more sympathy in his soul's needs; for he is a type of condition of soul.<a name=334:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, later in the chapter, Levi, who is no doubt the counterpart of the man with the little couch, invited the Lord into his house.<a name=334:3></a> He was evidently a man of riches, a man of means; but being the counterpart of the man with the little couch, he was not big in his own apprehension.<a name=334:4></a> He did not regard his means as adding to him in any wise; they never add to us; on the contrary, the tendency is for them to detract from a person spiritually unless he holds them in regard of Christ, as a steward, a good steward.<a name=334:5></a> Unless he holds them in that light, the tendency would be to detract from him spiritually.<a name=334:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So Levi makes a great entertainment for Christ in his house, and the kind of people that the Lord would desire to have, from Luke's point of view, were in the house, "a great crowd of tax gatherers and others" (chapter 5: 29).<a name=334:7></a> I am referring to that in a moral way, so that we might see how Luke would lead us on in our education, in order that we might have part in the house of God.<a name=334:8></a> We shall all have part in the Father's house; God will have us there; the Lord has gone to prepare a place there; but I am speaking for the moment of the house in its provisional aspect in relation to the gospel.<a name=334:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I am somewhat afraid, dear brethren, that we are forgetting the gospel.<a name=335:1></a> I believe it is the divine thought that an evangelistic spirit should be found with the people of God at the end.<a name=335:2></a> I say that advisedly.<a name=335:3></a> I believe God will bring that about, not only an assembly state in regard of Christ, but an evangelical sympathy in sentiment and feeling.<a name=335:4></a> Luke speaks of the year, "<i>the acceptable year</i>"; mark, it is not only what was preached in the year, but that the year itself was preached.<a name=335:5></a> He says, "<i>to preach</i> the acceptable year of the Lord", as if it were glad tidings that there should be a long period of grace called "the acceptable year".<a name=335:6></a> That should be kept in mind; we are near the end of it, but it still remains, and the point is that there should be that spirit of evangelisation until all the elect shall be saved.<a name=335:7></a> I believe God will bring that about, and Luke has it in view.<a name=335:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So Levi makes a great entertainment for Christ, and then he had the kind of guests in his house that the Lord would appreciate; not his rich neighbours or relatives, those who could repay him, but he gets together the kind of people that the Lord desired; there was a company of publicans and sinners there.<a name=335:9></a> This drew out a certain opposition and criticism, for we read, "and their scribes and the Pharisees murmured" (verse 30), but Jesus said, "I am not come to call righteous persons, but sinful ones to repentance" (verse 32).<a name=335:10></a> Levi anticipated, or understood, the point of view, that it was the acceptable year, and the feast was in accord with it.<a name=335:11></a> He entertained Christ in that relation; it was not exactly a family affair, that is

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have mentioned these three incidents of houses that we might have them before us as indicative of the educational line which Luke has before him in his gospel, to prepare householders for the house of God.<a name=336:3></a> Matthew speaks of the householder; he says that a scribe instructed into the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a householder, who brings out of his treasure things new and things old (chapter 13:52); that is Matthew's point of view.<a name=336:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You can understand how Matthew would bring in the old things, the testimony of Moses and the prophets; the householder must have them in his treasury; the old things are there, not in the sense of cast-off things that are threadbare, but as antiques, things of value.<a name=336:5></a> There are such things in Scripture, and we must be on our guard not to discard the things of the Old Testament.<a name=336:6></a> They are kept in the treasury of every scribe instructed into the kingdom of heaven, and he brings them forth as he has opportunity; he delights in the antiques, as one might say, but he brings in the new first; the things in the New Testament are brought in and developed, but he does not forget the old: he calls attention to the old things, how they all point to Christ.<a name=336:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are old things and new things, and they both go together, they belong to the treasures of the scribe who is instructed into the kingdom of heaven.<a name=336:8></a> That indicates Matthew's point of view.<a name=336:9></a> He is concerned
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=337>[Page 337]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		about Christ as the Heir of David, and, necessarily, all things that come down, as one might say reverently; the things are handed down that belong to the family and should be treasured in the household, from Matthew's standpoint.<a name=337:1></a> But Luke is concerned about the sympathy, the evangelical sympathy, of the people of God.<a name=337:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there is another feature in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10">Luke  10</a>as to Mary and the house of Martha, in Bethany.<a name=337:3></a> It says that Martha received the Lord into her house (verse 38); the Spirit of God says that; she had the house and she had extended hospitality, genuine hospitality.<a name=337:4></a> Now we may be hospitable and yet not teachable.<a name=337:5></a> We have to acquire the habit of being taught of the Lord in our houses.<a name=337:6></a> Hospitality is spoken of in Scripture, and valued in Scripture, but teachability is more important than hospitality.<a name=337:7></a> The Lord will teach us, and so it says, "Mary .<a name=337:8></a>.<a name=337:9></a>.<a name=337:10></a> having sat down at the feet of Jesus was listening to his word" (verse 39).<a name=337:11></a> That is how it should read.<a name=337:12></a> What a character she was!<a name=337:13></a> He was speaking, and whatever He said she listened to it; that is the true disciple; she was truly teachable, simply listening to whatever Christ had to say.<a name=337:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Do you know anything about listening to Him?<a name=337:15></a> He is very varied in what He says.<a name=337:16></a> Whatever He said, Mary listened to it, but Martha did not.<a name=337:17></a> Martha owned the house; she extended hospitality and received Him into the house, and not only so, she served, she did the work; but one thing was needful and that was teachability.<a name=337:18></a> If we are not teachable, subject to Christ, receiving His word, all else will

		fail; so the Lord puts that right, so far as His word went; He said, "Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things; but there is need of one, and Mary has chosen the good part" (verses 41, 42).<a name=338:1></a> He had the house of God in view, and the one thing that He spoke about was essential in the house of God, that is, to listen.<a name=338:2></a> Martha might be hospitable and active in her house, but in the house of God where would she be?<a name=338:3></a> She was not listening, she was occupied with the cares and things of her house.<a name=338:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The position in the house of God is that the Spirit speaks there, and Christ speaks in the house.<a name=338:5></a> If we have not learned to listen, it is quite evident that we have missed the gain of what is going on; and hence the great advantage and gain of acquiring the habit in our houses of listening to the Lord and being taught of Him, of becoming teachable.<a name=338:6></a> Well, Luke presents all these things, as I have said, in view of the house of God.<a name=338:7></a>

		Stephen demonstrated that a Christian is a person with a living faith in Jesus, his Saviour and Master, and who is able to exhibit, in some degree, His graces.<a name=377:7></a> He belongs to a new race, who in their spirit, manner, and countenance are Christ-like.<a name=377:8></a> Let us not say that this is too high a standard, or that it is unobtainable, for the same Lord is at the right hand of God; the same Holy Spirit is indwelling believers today.<a name=377:9></a> The power is undiminished on God's side!<a name=377:10></a> Why then should we consider it beyond our reach, or unable to be reproduced?<a name=377:11></a> Through the centuries which have intervened, history has recorded again and again that such Christ-like features as were exhibited in Stephen have been seen in Christians.<a name=377:12></a> Witnesses have arisen during the absence of Christ who have displayed the features of their Master, and this Spirit is to be continued in Christians until the Lord comes.<a name=377:13></a>

		In the divinely-given record of man's history, two great principles of evil are to be seen.<a name=378:4></a> Coming under the power of evil, the principles of <i>corruption</i> and <i>violence</i> characterise him: and this was brought fully to light when Christ was here.<a name=378:5></a> Delighting in evil, man had no appreciation of good, which was perfectly expressed in Christ.<a name=378:6></a>
