		I am not sure, beloved friends, whether these scriptures will indicate what we have to say.<a name=1:3></a> I have not read them with any thought of an exposition of them, but because I think they indicate the points we desire to bring before you -- that is, christian fellowship, and then heavenly privileges of the saints at the present time.<a name=1:4></a> I might use the word assembly and say that we desire to bring before you the fellowship of the assembly and heavenly privileges of the assembly.<a name=1:5></a>

		I have been very much exercised about speaking here this evening.<a name=1:6></a> It were easy, in a sense, to occupy the time by the utterance of words, but that is not what is before us; but what we have before us in our small measure, and in a sense of our own feebleness, is really the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first place, the point I have in my mind in reading this scripture (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1">Revelation  1</a>) is that things are there brought before us individually.<a name=2:3></a> If we speak of the fellowship or the privileges of the assembly we are not, of course, speaking about the fellowship or privileges of an individual, but of the assembly, and I trust we are speaking of it in full view of scripture.<a name=2:4></a> We are not speaking of the fellowship privilege of "brethren" so-called, for it has come to pass that the term "brethren" (I do not know that we can altogether help it) often means, with some of us, a certain number of saints, but we desire for ourselves and for you that all this might drop out of our minds for the time being and that we may come back to the scriptural use of the word "assembly" as really embracing every Christian.<a name=2:5></a> But while one is desirous to have scriptural thoughts, scriptural conceptions, feelings, and affections for all Christians, for all the saints of God -- all who comprise His assembly, whether we speak of its fellowship or its privilege, we have to <i>begin individually</i>, and not only have we to begin individually, but in a certain sense we never lose our individuality.<a name=2:6></a> Though we may speak of ourselves in

		connection with the assembly we have to take account of ourselves individually; and whether it be the fellowship or the privilege of the assembly our ability to answer to the one or to the other is really the measure in which things are true of us individually.<a name=3:1></a> To speak simply, take the scripture we have read in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20:7">Acts  20:7</a>.<a name=3:2></a> "And the first day of the week, we being assembled to break bread" (not simply the disciples at Troas, it is "we", inclusive of Paul and his company who were there at that time).<a name=3:3></a> Now I think I am addressing a company who are familiar with that.<a name=3:4></a> I am addressing those who are in the habit of coming together on the first day of the week to break bread; but our coming together on the first day of the week to break bread does not in itself change our individual spiritual condition.<a name=3:5></a> If I leave such and such a place, and come into this room, the fact of getting ready and leaving my house and coming to the room and sitting down with the Lord's people here does not change my spiritual state.<a name=3:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want, beloved, in connection with that scripture we read in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1">Revelation  1</a>to emphasize that which is individual; not simply as to the possession of the Spirit, but that which is individual in connection with the <i>activities</i> of the Spirit in me.<a name=3:7></a> We are not going to discuss the point as to whether every Christian has

		the Spirit; we are assuming that every Christian is indwelt by the Spirit, but I believe it needs to be emphasized in our souls at this time -- what must be true of us individually.<a name=4:1></a> If it is not true of us individually the fact of fellowship with others in the breaking of bread, or the question of outward association with others who are spiritually fitted for the enjoyment of privilege, will not help us.<a name=4:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is wonderful how John speaks of himself.<a name=4:3></a> If he had said: "I John, an apostle", we might have been interested in what he was about to say, but if he had said <i>that</i> we should have had to stand off, as it were, we should have had to say -- it is not common ground.<a name=4:4></a> It never was common ground even when the apostles were here among the saints.<a name=4:5></a> "He has given some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints", but it could be asked even then: "Are all apostles?<a name=4:6></a> are all prophets?<a name=4:7></a> are all teachers?<a name=4:8></a>" Not by any means: "Having then gifts differing".<a name=4:9></a> But look how John speaks.<a name=4:10></a> He says, "I John, your brother".<a name=4:11></a> If a man speaks of himself as your brother, you may get close to that man; there is no distance, and more -- there is no difference; it is common ground.<a name=4:12></a> But it is not only "I John, your brother", but it is also "and <i>fellow partaker"</i>.<a name=4:13></a> That is the language of fellowship.<a name=4:14></a>

		Now I need not say to you -- because it will be very obvious to every one here -- that as banished to the Isle of Patmos it was not possible for John to give expression to his fellowship in the breaking of bread; you would have to have more than one saint for that; you might have the breaking of bread with two saints, or three, or more; but let me emphasize this -- John brings himself before us on common ground as our "brother", and he is in fellowship.<a name=5:1></a> Oh!<a name=5:2></a> you say, could a man be in fellowship without breaking bread?<a name=5:3></a> Excuse me if, in reply, I ask you: How is he going to break bread according to scripture if he is <i>not</i> in fellowship?<a name=5:4></a> If I understand the breaking of bread, it does not <i>produce</i> fellowship; the breaking of bread is the scriptural and divinely-appointed <i>expression</i> of it, but fellowship must exist.<a name=5:5></a> What else could you make of the order of the words in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:42">Acts  2:42</a>: "And they persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers"?<a name=5:6></a> That is the right order.<a name=5:7></a> Does Paul call in question the fact of the Corinthians being Christians?<a name=5:8></a> Look at the very opening of his epistle to them.<a name=5:9></a> He addresses them.<a name=5:10></a> "To the assembly of God which is in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints" -- not "called <i>to be</i> saints".<a name=5:11></a> They were constituted such by divine

		calling.<a name=6:1></a> So far from calling in question their Christianity, he speaks of it as a matter of thanksgiving, and he does not hesitate for a moment to give expression to his assurance concerning them -- assurance that not only covers the present but reaches on into the eternal future; and yet, beloved, you may have a number of Christians and they may break bread -- (that is, outwardly -- there is the table and the bread and the wine, and things may be done in a kind of orderly way), but if the truth of fellowship is not there, if they are not in fellowship, how would that affect their outward breaking of bread?<a name=6:2></a> Well, in Paul's judgment it would so seriously affect it that Paul would absolutely deny that their breaking of bread was the Lord's supper.<a name=6:3></a> Now that may seem a kind of paradox, but that is just what he says in chapter 11: 20.<a name=6:4></a> Ostensibly, and possibly in outward form, there was the breaking of bread, but he says, "When ye come together therefore into one place, it is not to eat the Lord's supper".<a name=6:5></a> And he says why; his statement is not arbitrary, or one which is unsupported by good reasons.<a name=6:6></a> The first thing, then, is individuality, and we have got to be in fellowship, and the question is, How?<a name=6:7></a> Well, what we desire to affirm most emphatically is that everything in Christianity not only subsists in the power of the Spirit of God, but everything in Christianity
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		must be <i>taken</i> up in the power of the Spirit of God.<a name=7:1></a> If the breaking of bread is taken up apart from the activities and power of the Spirit of God in us, it will lose its proper character.<a name=7:2></a> This was the case with the Corinthians; the reality of fellowship was not there; externally they were in fellowship and responsibly they were in fellowship, but fellowship was not there -- they were carnal -- fleshly.<a name=7:3></a> "For whereas there are among you emulation and strife, are ye not carnal, and walk according to man?<a name=7:4></a>" These are the specifications supporting and proving the apostle's charge that they were "carnal", "fleshly".<a name=7:5></a> It is a serious thing.<a name=7:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have thought -- I do not speak positively, but as a suggestion -- that the opening of 1 Corinthians is very significant.<a name=7:7></a> In chapter 1 the cross of Christ is emphasized, and it is the cross of Christ not simply as meeting the question of man's sins, but as meeting the whole state and condition of man according to flesh.<a name=7:8></a> There were great differences in that day with regard to man according to flesh, and there are great differences now.<a name=7:9></a> Some of them at that time were very religious -- they were the Jews.<a name=7:10></a> Some men were not religious, they were intellectually cultured men, they were philosophical men, but, differ as they might in the sense in which we have just spoken, they were
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=8>[Page 8]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		united in their opposition to the truth.<a name=8:1></a> Why?<a name=8:2></a> Because the cross set man according to the flesh -- religious man according to the flesh, aside; indeed, it was the sentence of divine judgment upon that man, and it was just as much the sentence of divine judgment upon the other man, the philosophical man.<a name=8:3></a> The preaching of the cross was foolishness to the Greek and a stumbling-block to the Jew.<a name=8:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in chapter 2 what is emphasized is the Spirit, and I presume that you would agree with me that it is on the ground of the cross -- the cross as that in which man according to flesh has been judged and judicially terminated and set aside for ever from before God -- that it is on that ground the Spirit is given.<a name=8:5></a> Now if that is the ground upon which the Spirit is given, it is only as the truth of the cross is really made good in our souls that we may expect the activities of the Spirit of God in us.<a name=8:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now take chapter 11: 31.<a name=8:7></a> What does Paul say there?<a name=8:8></a> "If we judged ourselves, so were we not judged".<a name=8:9></a> That is the practical power of the cross so brought to bear on my soul that I judge myself: "But let a man prove himself, and thus eat of the bread and drink of the cup".<a name=8:10></a> They were refusing to judge themselves at Corinth and they were coming under the judgment of the Lord.<a name=8:11></a> I venture to say

		this -- some of us get over bad conduct or bad ways because perhaps we have grace enough to pull off the bad fruit when it appears, but we do not <i>judge</i> ourselves.<a name=9:1></a> There will not be bad fruit or bad conduct if there is the judgment of self.<a name=9:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 5 the apostle is beginning to deal with the saints in a very practical way -- a very real way, and what comes to light is that the failure to judge themselves at Corinth was bearing its bad fruit in many ways; but what I call your attention to for a moment is this -- he brings in the truth of the Passover: "For also our passover, Christ, has been sacrificed".<a name=9:3></a> Now while the head of each family in Israel had to take the lamb, and was responsible for the slaying of it, you must remember that was only true in the beginning; after priesthood came in, the priest attended to the slaying of the paschal lamb; but when we come to Christianity you and I have had no part in the death of Christ -- "our passover".<a name=9:4></a> For Christ our passover has <i>been</i> slain for us; but where the truth is brought to bear upon us in this passage is just as the feast of unleavened bread lasting seven days (a complete period), was based upon the passover and was really the practical answer in the Israelites to what the paschal lamb represented and typified -- so it is here; he applies it to us, and here is
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=10>[Page 10]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the real reason why these beloved saints at Corinth were not in the truth of fellowship.<a name=10:1></a> Hence when they came together ostensibly to break bread Paul said, I cannot own it, "this is not to partake of the Lord's supper".<a name=10:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So in chapter 5 we come to the bottom of this; their failure was in what the feast of unleavened bread sets forth; there was not in them the practical answer to the death of Christ as the true passover.<a name=10:3></a> Instead of purging out the old leaven, Paul brings them face to face with the fact that the old leaven had been allowed by them and it was active among them, and so they are called upon to purge out the old leaven that they might answer in their practical condition to what was true before God of the saints viewed in the light of the death of Christ as our true passover.<a name=10:4></a> There was their failure, and how could there be the activities of the Spirit?<a name=10:5></a> The Corinthians had the Spirit -- chapter 6 is positive proof of it -- the apostle does not challenge the fact of their having the Spirit; he owns in it chapter 2 and he owns it right through his epistle -- he owns it in chapter 3, for, apart from the Spirit, how could the saints be spoken of as the temple of God?<a name=10:6></a> He is speaking to them individually, as it were, of their bodies being the temple of the Holy Ghost, "which is in you, which ye have of God; and ye are not your
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=11>[Page 11]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		own, for ye have been bought with a price"; but he most emphatically challenges their having the activities of the Spirit.<a name=11:1></a> He says, I cannot speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal.<a name=11:2></a> I know that many of us have dropped, perhaps unconsciously, into the thought that "spiritual" describes solve wonderful attainment on the part of Christians, but it is not so.<a name=11:3></a> If you are a Christian you ought to be spiritual.<a name=11:4></a> To be spiritual is the normal condition of every Christian; one might say God has had it before Him in giving us the Spirit that we might be spiritual.<a name=11:5></a> Has God given us the Spirit that we might grieve Him, and that we might allow the flesh -- indulge the flesh?<a name=11:6></a> No; He has given us the Spirit that we might be spiritual and not carnal.<a name=11:7></a> For this there must be correspondence and fellowship with Christ's death.<a name=11:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now where the trouble lay was in the fact that there was not an answer in their souls to the death of Christ as the passover lamb.<a name=11:9></a> And let me say one simple word -- when it speaks of Christ as our passover (the great truth set forth in the passover was God acting in judgment -- it was a night of judgment, and in the blood of that lamb, sprinkled with the bunch of hyssop on the two side posts and the upper door post of the houses where they dwelt, presented for the eye of God), there was this fact set forth that the judgment of God had already taken

		place; the blood which was sprinkled there sheltered and screened them .<a name=12:1></a>.<a name=12:2></a>.<a name=12:3></a> .<a name=12:4></a> I trust you will in grace bear with my saying a word as to this, but I feel that in these days many of us are occupied and working away with a <i>superstructure</i> in Christianity, when the real trouble is that which is connected with the moral <i>foundations</i> of Christianity in our souls; we are occupied with the superstructure, and we do not get on very well with it.<a name=12:5></a> What is the cause?<a name=12:6></a> The foundation is lacking in our souls.<a name=12:7></a> And for this we have not to look on one another, but each one of us to see to it for ourselves.<a name=12:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, the Corinthians were not ready for the supper.<a name=12:9></a> The supper is the divinely-appointed expression of the fellowship, and it is most precious to me, if one might for a moment speak personally -- it becomes more precious than ever to me in all the years that pass by; but, beloved brethren, <i>the fellowship must be there</i>.<a name=12:10></a> The Corinthians were partaking of the supper <i>outwardly</i>, and in doing so they were eating and drinking judgment to themselves.<a name=12:11></a> I need not stop to say to you that the Lord never designed that in the breaking of bread you and I should be eating and drinking judgment to ourselves; the Lord intended that it should stand till He comes, and as the precious expression of the truth of our fellowship together --

		fellowship based upon His death, a fellowship that calls for correspondence with that death, and a fellowship together in His love expressed in His death; that is the Lord's supper.<a name=13:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, I have dwelt thus long on the individual side of it; I trust that we may be able to receive it and to take it home to ourselves, for the Lord does individualise things.<a name=13:2></a> I am aware that fellowship in the very conception of it is the fellowship of the assembly of God; indeed, I do not know any other fellowship -- I am not concerned about any other but the fellowship of the assembly of God, and while it necessarily embraces all who are in and of the assembly it does not at all interfere with individual responsibility "Let a man judge himself, and so let him eat"; that is individual.<a name=13:3></a> I am coming to the supper every Lord's Day morning, but it is a solemn consideration -- am I really in the truth of fellowship?<a name=13:4></a> It all turns upon the Spirit of God, and the free action of the Spirit of God in your soul, and that depends on whether you are in correspondence with the judgment of God as expressed in the death of Christ as our passover.<a name=13:5></a> He has borne the judgment, but, mind you, those who are sheltered and screened by that blood are those who are called upon to keep the feast of unleavened bread; and if the

		leaven is allowed individually, or if it is allowed collectively, it vitiates fellowship and it vitiates the breaking of bread.<a name=14:1></a> You cannot have the Lord's supper apart from the truth and reality of fellowship, and the truth and reality of fellowship involves your unconditional acceptance of the judgment of God as expressed in the death of Christ as our passover.<a name=14:2></a> It is not the passover at the supper; it is a different aspect of Christ's death altogether.<a name=14:3></a> In the Lord's supper it is the Lord's death as the expression of His love for us; you cannot have any words better than the Lord's own words: "This is my body, which is for you.<a name=14:4></a> This cup is the new covenant in my blood, poured out for you".<a name=14:5></a> It is His death as the expression of His love, and it is the expression of God's love for us.<a name=14:6></a> It is not only the "love of God which is in Christ Jesus", but it is the death of the Lord Jesus wherein He expressed His love for us that the love of God finds its full and perfect expression; not that we can separate them; you may distinguish them in a certain sense, but you cannot separate them .<a name=14:7></a>.<a name=14:8></a>.<a name=14:9></a> .<a name=14:10></a>

		I do not see how I could dare to come next Lord's Day morning and sit down with the saints to partake of the Lord's supper if I were not self-judged.<a name=14:11></a> I beg you to bear with this; I say it for the sake of the truth; we need it in its living, practical power in our

		Now is the time to go in for the reality of the truth of Christianity, whether it be the privilege or the fellowship of the assembly.<a name=17:6></a> There are, I fear, a good many in a path of pretension and assumption; they boldly say, <i>We</i> are the assembly, <i>we</i> are the church.<a name=17:7></a> On the other hand there is the ignoring of the truth of the assembly -- utter independency!<a name=17:8></a> And the only thing that will preserve from either the one or the other is the <i>truth</i> of the assembly.<a name=17:9></a> If I find a few people who are in the truth of the assembly, or the privilege of the assembly, I am glad to have the opportunity of being with them, but we want to stand for the <i>truth</i> in these days.<a name=17:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We have, in the passages I have read, three wonderful facts concerning our Lord Jesus Christ, and I need not say that if they concern Him they ought to concern us, because when you come to Christianity everything is really so inseparably bound up with Himself, and with facts concerning Himself, that I am sure nothing could be more important, more deeply interesting to us, than the consideration of the facts concerning Himself.<a name=20:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to speak very simply.<a name=20:4></a> The first fact is the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ, and, pursuing the order of our reading, the second fact is the ascension of our Lord Jesus Christ; and then the third fact, in what is recorded in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>, is the Lord coming into the midst of His disciples as they were thus gathered together, and what is connected with His presence as thus found in the midst.<a name=20:5></a> But

	<div class="paragraph">
		if we take account of time we should have to say that the third fact precedes the second, because as a matter of fact the Lord Jesus Christ in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>had not ascended -- He was risen from the dead, but He had not yet ascended.<a name=21:1></a> Indeed, I suppose there would be at least a period of forty days between His resurrection and taking His place in the midst of His own, as recorded in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>, and the fact of His ascension as recorded in the closing verses of <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24">Luke  24</a>.<a name=21:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let me say further -- these were three wonderful facts of actuality.<a name=21:3></a> The resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ was an actual fact.<a name=21:4></a> I wish to dwell upon it for a moment, because I would that the Spirit of God might so bring these facts before us that they might affect us in all their actuality; and so with regard to the fact of His ascension it is actual; so with regard to His corning into the midst of His disciples as it is brought before us in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>, it was actual.<a name=21:5></a> I suppose with regard to time that both the first and third facts occurred on the same day.<a name=21:6></a> His taking His place in the midst of His own was on the very day of His resurrection, while the second fact -- the fact of His ascension, did not occur until the end of that period mentioned by Luke in the opening of the Acts of the Apostles -- the end of the forty days.<a name=21:7></a>

		The actual appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ in the midst of His own in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>is really a pattern (I use the word because it is so freely used amongst us), and it is a pattern, beloved friends, of the assembly; not the assembly as in the light of I Corinthians, where the world is in view, and where those who do not believe may come into the midst of the company, but the assembly in a spiritual way, and not only in a spiritual way, but the assembly in regard to real enjoyment of heavenly privileges; and so (if we take the actual fact recorded in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>as a pattern, though its application to us would be in a spiritual way, and we should have to take it in that sense out of the realm of what is actual and transfer it to the realm of what is spiritual), it is none the less true.<a name=22:1></a> I know there are those who seem to think that if you talk about things that are spiritual you talk about things that are not real, but it is not so at all.<a name=22:2></a> It is a fact of spiritual reality in its application to us, and I have not much doubt that so far as regards the moral order of these three scriptures, that we have read them to you in their correct order.<a name=22:3></a> We first learn the Lord in connection with resurrection, and then we learn the Lord in connection with ascension, and with all that it involves for us in connection with Christianity, and then I

	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish to speak first of the Lord in resurrection.<a name=23:2></a> I am very conscious of great feebleness in attempting, in any way, to speak of such marvellous facts -- facts of such tremendous importance.<a name=23:3></a> I could not hope in any sense whatever to cover the ground: I could not pretend in the course of a few minutes to speak to you of all that is involved for God and for us in the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=23:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now it is difficult in a certain sense to speak of these three facts without at least an allusion to what goes before and to what fairly underlies these facts, and to what gives them their wonderful significance and meaning -- I mean the death of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=23:5></a> We have four accounts of His death: we have Matthew's account, and Mark's account, Luke's account, and John's account.<a name=23:6></a> I cannot take the time, beloved friends, to mark out in any detail the distinctions and differences, but I would rather allude to the broad general fact of the death of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=23:7></a> It has often been said that in Matthew and Mark He is the Victim, hence in Matthew and Mark you get that cry from His lips on the cross: "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?<a name=23:8></a>" but in

		Luke He is not exactly the Victim; that is, it is not exactly in that way that Luke presents Him in connection with His death; He is rather the offering Priest; He offers Himself, as we get it in Hebrews -- "Who by the eternal Spirit offered himself spotless to God".<a name=24:1></a> But John's account must for ever stand alone; it has its own unique character; He delivers up His spirit -- that is the wonderful thing when you come to John's account of His death.<a name=24:2></a> That is a marvellous fact.<a name=24:3></a> It is not in your power, or mine, or in the power of any one to deliver up one's spirit, but it was in His power; after He had cried He bowed His head and delivered up His spirit.<a name=24:4></a> Not only, beloved, is He presented in John's gospel as a divine Person in manhood, but even speaking of Him for a moment as a Man -- oh, what a Man!<a name=24:5></a> Such a Man had never been in this world before.<a name=24:6></a> He did not need to wait for His own death, or His own resurrection; He could say at the grave of Lazarus: "I am the resurrection and the life".<a name=24:7></a> Resurrection and life were inherent in Him as a Man.<a name=24:8></a> The Father had given to Him as Man to have life in Himself.<a name=24:9></a> If you think of Him as a divine Person only, you could not speak of anything having been <i>given</i> to Him; as a divine Person all was His; He was equal with the Father and the Holy Spirit in the Godhead; but He had taken upon

		Him the condition of Man, and so He says in <a href="../bible/John.htm#5">John  5</a>"For even as the Father has life in himself, so he has given to the Son also to have life in himself"; and then in chapter 10 He says: "I have authority to lay it down and I have authority to take it again" -- "No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself".<a name=25:1></a> Have you considered Him in this wonderful light?<a name=25:2></a> <i>What</i> a Man!<a name=25:3></a> I am inclined to think that the title -- the inherited name according to Hebrews -- the Son of God  -- is not a title or name that describes Him so much as a divine Person; it describes Him as a Man born in time; in His relationship to God <i>that</i> Man was God's Son.<a name=25:4></a> It is true that underneath that -- never apart from it -- there is the blessed fact that He was the only-begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father.<a name=25:5></a> But, not to multiply words, what I say is, that John's account of His death is unique -- He delivers up His own life; and so it is with His resurrection, as He says in chapter 2 of this gospel: "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up"; He was alluding to His own body.<a name=25:6></a> He delivers up His spirit, and He raises Himself; it is all His own blessed act, and He is not "carried up" into heaven in John; He says: "I <i>ascend</i>"; it belonged to Him; He had that right, that privilege, in His own Person as Man; He says

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have made a sort of digression, yet I trust it will not be without some profit; but I want to go back to the fact of His resurrection.<a name=26:2></a> I need hardly say that the resurrection presupposes death, whether on the part of the Lord or anybody else.<a name=26:3></a> Some of us may be in the room tonight who will never know resurrection, because the apostle says: "Behold, I tell you a mystery: We shall not all fall asleep, but we shall all be changed, in an instant, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet" -- it is a wonderful fact (I can hardly forbear alluding to it).<a name=26:4></a> People say: You have got to die.<a name=26:5></a> I say: No, in a real sense -- a literal sense -- I have <i>not</i> got to die.<a name=26:6></a> If the assembling shout should be heard tonight, not one of us Christians in this room would ever fall asleep -- we should all be changed: in the practical effect it comes to the same thing, whether we are raised or changed, but for the moment I call your attention to the fact that resurrection, whether of the Lord Jesus or of the saints, implies death.<a name=26:7></a> And so with the Lord Jesus, He really died; even in John His death is very real; indeed, the reality of it in John stands out, perhaps, as it does not stand out in any other gospel, because it is only in John that we get the incident of the Roman soldier, and the

		spear thrust into His side.<a name=27:1></a> Whatever peculiar character or significance attaches to His death in John's gospel, you cannot read that record without the reality of it corning vividly before you.<a name=27:2></a> It is said "He was already dead", hence the action of the soldier -- "The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first and of the other that had been crucified with him; but coming to Jesus, when they saw that he was already dead they did not break his legs, but one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water".<a name=27:3></a> Wonderful witness to the reality of His death!<a name=27:4></a>

		Now to come to the resurrection.<a name=27:5></a> I hardly know how to begin to speak of it, because it is so marvellous -- so transcendently great; but there is no fear of over-statement; the question is, can we take it in -- can we speak truly according to the scriptures of the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ?<a name=27:6></a> In the most simple way we might speak of its <i>effect</i>, for it had a wonderful effect upon the disciples of the Lord; you can hardly conceive of a greater moral effect than <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24">Luke  24</a>gives you as to this company.<a name=27:7></a> If we take account of them in the beginning of the chapter we see how they were affected by the death of the Lord!<a name=27:8></a> Peter says in his first epistle: "Blessed be the God and Father of

		THE HEART OF THE LORD JESUS AT THE MOMENT OF ENTIRE REJECTION
	</div>

		<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11:25">Matthew  11:25</a> - 30.<a name=39:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first three words of verse 25 the Spirit of God calls our attention to this wonderful moment in connection with our Lord's path and ministry down here.<a name=39:2></a> Generally speaking, what marked the moment on the part of man was the utter refusal and rejection of our Lord Jesus Christ; indeed, speaking morally (not quite actually), I think we get "at that time" the climax of the rejection of our Lord by the inhabitants of the land of Palestine.<a name=39:3></a> Confining ourselves to this chapter, there are three things that marked the moment.<a name=39:4></a> The first is the sorrowful and painful breakdown and failure of John Baptist.<a name=39:5></a> We must not allow ourselves to lower our thoughts or estimation of him, because in this very chapter the Lord in His grace bears a most wonderful testimony as to him.<a name=39:6></a> He says: "Verily I say to you, that there is not arisen among the born of women a greater than John the baptist", nevertheless, it

	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		is a sorrowful breakdown on the part of that wonderful man.<a name=40:1></a> He was no other than the forerunner of the Lord Jesus Christ, the one who had been appointed of God to introduce publicly the Son of God to Israel, and yet it is evident that there is a breakdown.<a name=40:2></a> Just fancy that man, John Baptist, sending a message -- "Art thou the coming one?<a name=40:3></a> or are we to wait for another?<a name=40:4></a>" -- the man who, on the banks of Jordan, in the presence of those assembled thousands of Israel, had borne that beautiful testimony, "Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world"; then the next day, not publicly, but privately, there had burst from his lips that spontaneous testimony as he looked upon Jesus as He walked, "Be hold the Lamb of God"; and the effect of that testimony on two of John's disciples was that they immediately turned and began to follow the One of whom John had just borne this wonderful testimony.<a name=40:5></a> Now he is in prison; it is no longer Jordan -- no longer the assembled thousands of Israel, and, I would say it sadly, it is no longer with John the energy of the Holy Ghost by which he bore that testimony.<a name=40:6></a> He is shut up in prison alone, and having heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent by his disciples and said to Him: "Art thou the coming one?<a name=40:7></a> or are we to wait for another?<a name=40:8></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in the second case we have a very

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=41>[Page 41]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		solemn picture of the moral insensibility and indifference that characterised that generation who were here when the Lord was here, for the language the Lord used -- the simile He introduced, emphasizes in a most solemn way their utter indifference and insensibility.<a name=41:1></a> There was absolutely no repentance.<a name=41:2></a> There were the sweet "pipings" of grace in the ministry of the Lord, but no responsive dancing; there was the "mourning" in the ministry of John Baptist, but no responsive wailing.<a name=41:3></a> Hence He says: "But to whom shall I liken this generation?<a name=41:4></a> It is like children sitting in the markets, which, calling to their companions, say, We have piped to you, and ye have not danced: we have mourned to you, and ye have not wailed".<a name=41:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then lastly we have the Lord's reproach to these cities of Chorazin and Bethsaida particularly, and then Capernaum.<a name=41:6></a> In these cities they had been privileged to witness the mighty works of power wrought by the Lord Jesus Christ, and there was no repentance, no evidence of any work of God in their souls, no evidence of any proper sense of their responsibility in regard to God.<a name=41:7></a> God had sent that blessed One, and in the midst of these cities, on the behalf of God.<a name=41:8></a> He had wrought these mighty works of power, and there was no repentance.<a name=41:9></a>

		language which came from the lips of the Lord Jesus concerning these cities, but I want to shew you that these things marked that moment, and it was: "At that time, Jesus answering said, I praise thee, Father, Lord of the heaven and of the earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes.<a name=42:1></a> Yea, Father, for thus has it been well-pleasing in thy sight".<a name=42:2></a> I hardly know how to speak of this as I should.<a name=42:3></a> How glorious the Lord appears!<a name=42:4></a> how glorious morally, spiritually!<a name=42:5></a> Many of us have eyes and ears and hearts for that which is merely material and external, but there is nothing of that sort here: what characterises the Lord "at that time" is like a sunburst on a very dark, cloudy and stormy day.<a name=42:6></a> I cannot refrain from saying I have a sense of how little I am like Him; how easily we succumb to discouraging circumstances.<a name=42:7></a> Many of us can manage a hymn of praise when things are bright and fair, but how many of us could manage a note of praise at a time like this?<a name=42:8></a> It is an ascending note of praise, and I am sure it filled the ears and heart of the Father with the sweetest music that had ever risen up from this world; the music of that note of praise not only filled the Father's heart with delight and pleasure, but it has been sounding down through the intervening centuries, and I feel that all of us

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The "Lord of the heaven and of the earth", I understand, expresses the thought of sovereign Ruler.<a name=43:2></a> The Father is the sovereign Ruler of the heaven and the earth.<a name=43:3></a> No matter who breaks down, no matter what indifference or insensibility or impenitence may be in evidence, He, the eternal Father, sits upon the eternal throne, and He is the sovereign Ruler of the heaven and of the earth.<a name=43:4></a> Do not give up in discouragement, do not get under the power of any breakdown here, the Father is the sovereign Ruler of the heaven and of the earth.<a name=43:5></a> It was just the suited moment for the Lord Jesus.<a name=43:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You know, speaking generally, the way the Spirit of God presents the Lord to us, especially in the first three gospels.<a name=43:7></a> He is "A man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief".<a name=43:8></a> The record of the notes of praise are very rare; but how sweet this note is; what a contrast to the words that have just left His lips -- sorrowful, solemn words, announcing the gathering clouds of divine judgment.<a name=43:9></a> But the moment His heart turns to the Father there leaps out from His lips this note of praise: "I praise thee, Father, Lord of the heaven and of the earth, that thou hast hid these things from the

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then let me note another thing.<a name=44:3></a> There is, as He turns to the Father, the ascending note of praise as we have seen, and then as He turns to all those about Him -- what do we find?<a name=44:4></a> The outflowing streams of divine grace!<a name=44:5></a> I am afraid if you and I had been there at that time it might have been a sound of murmuring, a note of discouragement, and perhaps we should have closed our hearts against those about us.<a name=44:6></a> We might have said, Everything is in vain; there is no use going on with men.<a name=44:7></a> Not so the Lord.<a name=44:8></a> You know what the Lord Himself says: "Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh", and He stands before us the perfect example, the perfect illustration of that.<a name=44:9></a> From that heart, beloved, that was filled with the eternal sunshine of the Father's love there leaped this blessed note of praise, and from that same heart He turns to men and says: "Come to me, all ye who labour and are burdened, and I will give you rest".<a name=44:10></a> How it makes one long to be a little more like Him!<a name=44:11></a> Well now, let me say, the conditions that are expressed in the three things mentioned in this chapter have obtained from that day to this.<a name=44:12></a> They obtain all around us tonight.<a name=44:13></a> There is plenty of failure; there is even the

		questioning, in the spirit of it, "Art thou he that should come?<a name=45:1></a> or are we to wait for another?<a name=45:2></a>" and there is still the indifference, the impenitence all about us; but the music of that note of praise may still be heard and felt in our hearts, and those precious streams of divine grace that burst from His lips are still flowing, so that tonight we may still catch the tones of that voice, we may still hear Him saying: "Come to me, all ye who labour and are burdened".<a name=45:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Some one has said that in this passage (the end of <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11">Matthew  11</a>) Matthew and John coalesce.<a name=45:4></a> I do not think it is too much to say that what comes out in these wonderful utterances, whether it be the note of praise to the Father, or the expression of His grace, and what precedes it, is not exactly characteristic of Matthew, it would be rather more characteristic of John; but in saying this you understand it is not calling in question the absolute perfection of scripture; you may depend upon it that it is set in the right place; the Spirit of God has put it just where it should be, and the very darkness of the moment, the breakdown of John, the indifference, the insensibility, and the impenitence that formed the background of it only make it shine out the more brilliantly.<a name=45:5></a>

		Persons that all the interest, the value and importance of scripture centre; and surely we have that revelation here.<a name=46:1></a> There is first the note of praise to the Father, and then He says: "All things have been delivered to me by my Father".<a name=46:2></a> The Lord Jesus never speaks from the standpoint of circumstances.<a name=46:3></a> Underneath all the circumstances of His path and ministry here there ever was that wonderful divine circle of holy heavenly relationship between Himself and the Father.<a name=46:4></a> It is not always seen, it does not always come out, but it is always there.<a name=46:5></a> If we speak for a moment of the circumstances surrounding the Lord -- did it look as if all things had been delivered to Him of the Father?<a name=46:6></a> Indeed, it did not.<a name=46:7></a> I do not think I should be exceeding the scripture if I said that so far as the external look of things went at that time it looked as if the whole ministry and miracles of the Lord Jesus were a complete failure -- it <i>looked</i> that way.<a name=46:8></a> But the Lord had a heavenly and out-of-the-world view; He was not looking at circumstances only.<a name=46:9></a> He does look at circumstances in His previous utterances, and His utterances are absolutely perfect; but when He turns to the Father He retires in spirit from all external circumstances of His path, and retreats into that holy, heavenly circle of relationship and affection between Himself and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the Father, and retiring there He can not only send up the note of praise and express His most perfect and absolute acquiescence in, and subjection as a Man to, the Father's will, but He can go on to say: "All things are delivered to me by my Father".<a name=47:1></a> He is standing there amidst all this rejection, and indifference, and impenitence, and if the Father is brought before us as the sovereign Ruler of the heaven and of the earth, that sovereign Ruler of the heaven and of the earth has put "all things" (and who would dare to limit it?<a name=47:2></a> -- I would say the language of the context would require that we should keep to the scope of the Father's sovereignty; He is sovereign; He -- the Lord of the heaven and of the earth), has delivered "all things" into the hands of Him who is the Son -- He speaks of Himself as the Son, as a divine Person in relationship with the Father -- nevertheless, He speaks as <i>Man down here</i>; it is to my mind one of the most lovely -- indescribably lovely pictures of that blessed One as Man down here.<a name=47:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now He goes on -- "All things have been delivered to me by my Father, and no one knows the Son but the Father".<a name=47:4></a> That remains in all its unchanged force of meaning as true tonight as when those words left His blessed lips.<a name=47:5></a> That has not been brought into revelation; it lies beyond the scope of revelation,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=48>[Page 48]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and lying beyond that scope, it lies outside what we <i>know</i>; though I think it would not be too much to say that at that time the Son even viewed as Man was not known by any one; not that that is the force of the expression; the expression is to be left in its proper force and meaning.<a name=48:1></a> "Nor does any one know the Father, but the Son" (that is the same word -- real knowledge, not a mere objective acquaintance with the Person), "and he to whom the Son may be pleased to reveal him".<a name=48:2></a> From all eternity the Son <i>had</i> His home, and has His home in the bosom of the Father; and when He, the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, was pleased to take up a condition as Man down here, He brought into that, morally, all that belonged to Him as the only-begotten Son in the Father's bosom; He brought that intimate knowledge of the Father.<a name=48:3></a> And, further, it <i>marked</i> Him, it distinguished Him pre-eminently as a Man while He was here.<a name=48:4></a> Hence in the gospels, as it has often been said, He always spoke to God not as God, but to the Father as such; the only departure that scripture gives us is in connection with the cross when He cried; "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?<a name=48:5></a>" Now can you conceive what it would have been if a period had been placed after "Nor does any one know the Father, but the

	<div class="paragraph">
		Let me venture a little further.<a name=50:11></a> The force of the expression -- "the Father", here is not the common apprehension of it.<a name=50:12></a> It is the Father in His relation to the Son -- in His love for the Son.<a name=50:13></a> We have in <a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>, "God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son".<a name=50:14></a> We have the new covenant in that way, the blessed expression of God's love toward us; but we have more than that; w e have in the end of chapter 17 in the Lord's utterance to the Father, "And I have made known to them thy name, and will make it

		SEPARATION -- IDENTIFICATION WITH THE LORD

	<div class="paragraph">
		Jeremiah XV.<a name=71:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In one way, beloved friends, what we have read is a very simple passage of scripture: it is an appeal on the part of Jeremiah to Jehovah.<a name=71:2></a> The prophet was in circumstances of trial, of reproach and of persecution, and he turns to Jehovah and appeals to Him, asking that the Lord would interpose to avenge him of those who were his persecutors; and in connection with this appeal we learn what had brought the prophet into these circumstances of reproach and persecution, but before speaking at all of the answer that Jehovah vouchsafed to the prophet, I might say, beloved, that I have taken this scripture and bring it before you, because I believe that the time in which we are now living in a very important sense corresponds to the time in which Jeremiah was living; and the circumstances that surrounded Jeremiah find an answer in the circumstances that surround us as the Lord's people, or, if you please, as God's people, at this present time.<a name=71:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=72>[Page 72]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I need not tell you that Jeremiah lived on to the close of the history of the people of God in his day.<a name=72:1></a> Long before this, of course, the nation of Israel had been divided, and so far as the ten tribes are concerned, their history had closed in judgment; Shalmaneser the Assyrian had carried them away into captivity, and they have been there from that day to the present; they will, as we know, be recovered, and will yet be brought back into the land, and the whole nation will be reunited and brought into blessing; but even as to the kingdom of Judah, this prophet lived very near the end, he lived in the days of Josiah the king, and what marked Josiah's time in the beginning?<a name=72:2></a> When he came into the kingdom everything was very dark, they were suffering under the hand of Jehovah the results of their unfaithfulness.<a name=72:3></a> But I just want to say that there was a wonderful revival in the days of Josiah and of Jeremiah.<a name=72:4></a> The house of God was in a very sad state, and the service of God in connection with it was practically well-nigh abandoned; but God wrought -- Josiah was but a youth, but the heart of the young king was in exercise of soul before God, and he began where every true revival generally begins, that is, with God's interests here, and, of course, those interests at that time were centred in the temple  -- the house of God -- just as God's interests
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=73>[Page 73]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		are now centred in the assembly -- the church of the living God -- the house of God.<a name=73:1></a> So Josiah began to clear up things in connection with the house of God.<a name=73:2></a> Shaphan was the scribe; Hilkiah, the father of Jeremiah, was the high priest, and in connection with the work inaugurated by Jeremiah Hilkiah discovered in the house of God the book of the law of God, the book containing the mind of God concerning His beloved people.<a name=73:3></a> I must only speak briefly, but the book was given to Shaphan the scribe, and Shaphan carried it to the king, and the book was read, and the finding and the reading of that book was the beginning of a wonderful revival among God's people.<a name=73:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Jeremiah alludes to this.<a name=73:5></a> In connection with his appeal to Jehovah he writes his own personal experience; he says, "Thy words were found, and I did eat them".<a name=73:6></a> Hilkiah, the father of Jeremiah, literally found them; but it is not the details that I dwell on, but with the fact itself.<a name=73:7></a> What a wonderful thing!<a name=73:8></a> "Thy words" -- the very words of Jehovah, setting forth what was in the mind of Jehovah concerning His house, and concerning His people -- concerning His interests here in this scene.<a name=73:9></a> Jeremiah says: "Thy words were found, and I did eat them".<a name=73:10></a> You can understand the figure without any difficulty, because it is a very

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		simple figure; in eating food we appropriate it, and in the appropriation of it we realise the good of it.<a name=74:1></a> Eating food is what we are in the habit of doing constantly and literally, but Jeremiah speaks of eating in a moral sense, though the simplicity of the figure is kept up, and the result of eating the words of Jehovah was that he realised in his own soul the good of those words; and the first result was they made him very happy; he says, "and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart".<a name=74:2></a> But why did they make him so happy?<a name=74:3></a> Because those words of Jehovah made known to him the blessed fact of his complete identification with Jehovah, and his complete identification with Jehovah in the way of blessing.<a name=74:4></a> It is well to know that a person is happy, but it is better to know why they are happy, and Jeremiah tells us why: "Thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O Jehovah God of hosts"; he learned his complete identification with Jehovah God of hosts; it was such a wonderful identification.<a name=74:5></a> As illustration -- when a woman marries, she takes her husband's name -- she becomes called by his name; so Jeremiah was so wonderfully identified with Jehovah God of hosts, that he says, "for I am called by thy name".<a name=74:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then you get the next effect of "eating those
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=75>[Page 75]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		words".<a name=75:1></a> First -- they discovered to him his complete identification with Jehovah, and thus they brought to light his privilege, as identified with that name, and they filled his heart with rejoicing.<a name=75:2></a> That was one side, but then the other side was his responsibility, and that which measured his privilege and his blessing on the one side, measured his responsibility on the other side.<a name=75:3></a> If being called by the name of Jehovah God of hosts, was the full measure of his privilege, it became also the measure of his responsibility; he was responsible to stand apart from everything that dishonoured that name.<a name=75:4></a> So he says: "I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of thy hand: for thou hast filled me with indignation".<a name=75:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now it was not because of the rejoicing that filled his heart in the discovery of his privilege, it was not on that side that he had got into reproach -- although, of course, these things cannot be disconnected -- these two sides of the truth are never really apart.<a name=75:6></a> You may distinguish them, but you cannot separate them, for they go together.<a name=75:7></a> There is joy in the apprehension of privilege, but there is also the exercise connected with the apprehension of the side of responsibility, and, in a word, that is where you get into trial.<a name=75:8></a> The devil does not care how happy you are; he is not concerned

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		about your apprehension of privilege and your joy in the apprehension of it, but what the devil is opposed to is <i>separation</i>, and separation will get you into trouble, It always has got the people of God into trouble, That is nothing new; it could not be otherwise, I think, in a sense, that it was Abel's separation that got him into trouble with Cain, I think one might say, speaking reverently, it was so with the Lord, Oh!<a name=76:1></a> it was His intense separation that man could not bear, He was "holy, harmless, undefiled, separated from sinners".<a name=76:2></a> That was <i>one</i> reason why He suffered as He did at the hands of men, There is a wonderful testimony in separation, not in denunciation.<a name=76:3></a> Souls will get hardened under denunciation; you can easily get hard, and bitter, in connection with denunciation, but testimony is in separation, and as sure as we are marked by separation we shall be in the reproach that Jeremiah suffered from; and we know from the body of the book how he not only suffered reproach, but he suffered in every way from the hands of his enemies.<a name=76:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, what I want to come to is this, Just as there was a revival in the days of Jeremiah, so there has been a revival in our day, and, let me say, it is God who brings about a revival, God brings about revivals in the history of His people, and He brings them
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=77>[Page 77]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		about for His own glory and for the blessing of His people, You always find, beloved, in a divine revival that God ever has respect to that which He has established, to that which He has set up, There may be but a very few who are directly, personally, involved in the revival, but I am bold to say that in every revival God has in view, not only the maintenance of the testimony which He has established, but He has in view the blessing of His people.<a name=77:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, God has been pleased to bring about a revival in our day, He has been pleased to recover the truth for His own glory, and for the blessing, not simply of the few that may be immediately and personally concerned in connection with the revival, but God has in view the whole of His people, I wish we could think of that, because sometimes it seems to me we act as if we thought we were kind of favourites -- a few select ones, and that God had some special interest in some few of us that He has not in all His people, Well, there is the revival; but now the question is, what is <i>your</i> relationship and <i>mine</i> concerning it?<a name=77:2></a> God brings about a revival, But then a great many people become connected with it in a mere outward way, It was so in times of old; it is so in more modern times, In the days of Martin Luther there was a revival, and I believe God brought it about, He brought it

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=78>[Page 78]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		about for His glory and for the blessing of His people, all His people; yet how many there are that have a mere outward, historical connection with it!<a name=78:1></a> They still speak of belonging to reformed bodies or reformed churches; but, alas!<a name=78:2></a> it is only like what the Lord says about Sardis, "a name that thou livest and art dead", It may be so now.<a name=78:3></a> I am not saying whether it is so or not, but it may be a mere historical, outward, doctrinal, or ecclesiastical connection.<a name=78:4></a> But what I am concerned about is this, beloved, have you and I in our souls a living, vital connection with that revival which, unquestionably, the Lord has brought about in these last days?<a name=78:5></a> I do not wish to undervalue any one or any thing, but I am inclined to the conviction that we have witnessed the last revival in the history of the assembly here, and it is a very serious question -- what is your relationship and mine to it?<a name=78:6></a> -- for, however God may have wrought, and by whomsoever He may have wrought, the revival has come, God has brought it about, and what I think is emphasised in the passage I have read to you is this -- that whilst the revival concerns the honour and glory of God, the glory and the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, whilst it concerns the whole church of God, you and I have to be brought into it <i>individually</i>.<a name=78:7></a> God has not a remnant of the church before Him, Do you think He
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=79>[Page 79]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		has given up the church?<a name=79:1></a> Never, He will never give it up; the church, beloved, is just as much an object of interest and concern with God, and with the Lord Jesus tonight, as at any moment in its history.<a name=79:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But while it is true that the revival is not a matter that has for its object the blessing of an individual, or a number of individuals, but that in it God has the assembly in view, the honour and glory of God, the maintenance of the testimony of our Lord -- I repeat that I think what we should learn is, that you and I have got to be brought into it individually, We like large companies, and I am not averse to them; I am very thankful to the Lord for all that are here tonight; but we have to take this matter home to ourselves, each one of us, and we have to look it in the face, how far are we personally and individually in what God has brought about?<a name=79:3></a> My father, mother, brothers, sisters, may be in the meeting; but that will not do, If you are going to touch at all what God has wrought, if you are going to know the reality of it, you must know it for yourself: "Thy words were found, and I did eat them".<a name=79:4></a> These things test us as to our spiritual state, as to how it is with us in relation, to God, Jeremiah ate His words; he had an appetite for them: have you an appetite for the words of God -- for the testimony of

	<div class="paragraph">
		our Lord Jesus Christ?<a name=80:1></a> Then we see from what Jeremiah goes on to say that the question which was involved in the word of God's truth was identification of God's people with God Himself, .<a name=80:2></a>.<a name=80:3></a>.<a name=80:4></a> You may say, Is not that true of the whole church?<a name=80:5></a> Yes.<a name=80:6></a> I grant it is; but have you got a personal experience with regard to it?<a name=80:7></a> Has there been wrought in your soul such a spiritual appetite for God's words, His truth and His testimony?<a name=80:8></a> Some people are where I was once myself, when one thought the whole thing -- the acme in Christianity, was in being saved, and I am not saving anything against safety, nor certainty, nor enjoyment; but I.<a name=80:9></a> am opposed to sitting down on the doorstep of Christianity, There are a great many religious people in these days, there are a number of people, Christians too, who think that the whole thing is to get a little blessing for themselves, But that is not all; of course we all have to learn our A B C; but that is not the end of it: "Thy words were found, and <i>I did eat them</i>".<a name=80:10></a> It is a very serious question -- have we learned for ourselves our identification with the Lord Jesus Christ as the prophet learned his identification with Jehovah God of hosts?<a name=80:11></a> That is the test.<a name=80:12></a> I am afraid that we somehow hide ourselves under the general statement of the truth we know.<a name=80:13></a> Oh!<a name=80:14></a> you say, I have seen wonderful

		things about the assembly, But how have you seen them?<a name=81:1></a> Have you seen them through the light of the Spirit of God in connection with your own experience?<a name=81:2></a> If not, you are only the victim of a theory; it may be a very beautiful theory and quite correct, but that is all, Perhaps you have been brought up in the meetings -- have been converted, and you break bread, and I am thankful for it; but you will not mind if I ask you the question, have you really in your soul grasped this -- "for I am called by thy name", We did not all learn it so easy; some of us learnt it alone -- apart from teachers, or evangelists, and apart from tracts and books -- and it cost us something, and I want to press upon you the reality of it, Have you got the joy of it?<a name=81:3></a> We are told in the Old Testament that "the joy of the Lord is your strength", You ought to be happy; you and I are divinely entitled to be perfectly happy, and it is a great thing to be happy; you are so safe when you are happy <i>divinely</i>: "Thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name",

		Of course these words of Jehovah could be, and no doubt were, taken in a literal way by Jeremiah -- all in perfect keeping with the character of that dispensation; but we must take them in a spiritual way, and let me say that in the answer of Jehovah taken in that way there is everything that the heart of the believer could desire.<a name=84:1></a> You can count on the Lord; you can count on His making you to stand; you can count upon Him for your spiritual protection and preservation, for your deliverance.<a name=84:2></a> I would like to encourage any trembling heart that has been brought face to face with a little of the consequences of What it is to be true to the Lord at a time like this.<a name=84:3></a> He will really cause you to "stand before the Lord" -- to have a standing, as it were, in His presence.<a name=84:4></a> "And if thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth".<a name=84:5></a> Beware of indiscriminate condemnation or censure of anybody.<a name=84:6></a> Learn to discriminate; there is the precious and there is the vile; learn in your souls to discriminate spiritually.<a name=84:7></a> God encourages every one of us in that direction.<a name=84:8></a> He says: "Thou shalt be as my mouth: let them return unto thee; but return not thou unto them".<a name=84:9></a> If the Lord has separated you, never set your face in the direction of what He has separated you from.<a name=84:10></a>

		We must not forget that we are speaking from the Gospel of John, At the close of the gospel -- chapter 20 (chapter 21, though just as much inspired as any other chapter, is in the nature of an appendix), referring to the signs, of which there are seven recorded in the book, the Apostle John says, "But these are written, that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life in his name", The Spirit brings Jesus before us in the Gospel of John as the Christ and as the Son of God, It might perhaps be said that as the Christ it brings Him before us in a certain official way, in connection with His wonderful office and character as Messias, Christ, anointed Man, God's Messias, God's Christ, God's anointed Man; but when it adds "the Son of God" I think it brings Him personally before us as a Man in relation to God .<a name=106:11></a>.<a name=106:12></a>.<a name=106:13></a>.<a name=106:14></a> "Son of man" (and

		He was entitled to it, but the wonderful thing in John is that He will receive nothing, except from the hands of the Father; so He says, "Father, glorify thy Son, that thy Son may glorify thee", From the very first step of His path here to the last step His heart had been set on the glory of the Father, as He says a little further down, "I have glorified thee on the earth".<a name=108:1></a> .<a name=108:2></a>.<a name=108:3></a>.<a name=108:4></a> He had come forth from the Father and had come into the world, and He was now about to leave the world and return to the Father; but, beloved, He is just as much set upon glorifying the Father now that He is glorified by the Father, as He was in the days of His flesh down here; so He says, "Glorify thy Son, that thy Son may glorify thee".<a name=108:5></a> Then He continues: "As thou hast; given him authority over all flesh" -- and the word means more than authority, it means one who has the right and title as well as the power.<a name=108:6></a> The Lord in His death has established His right and claim, though He speaks of it as given to Him of the Father, and that is in perfect keeping with this gospel.<a name=108:7></a> Has He not by the grace of God "tasted death for everything"?<a name=108:8></a> Did He not give Himself a ransom for all?<a name=108:9></a> Has He not died for all Yes, He Was; and He has the right, title and claim, based upon that wonderful death, yet He attributes it to the Father.<a name=108:10></a> He says, "As

		Now I am coming to my present point.<a name=109:3></a> I am going to attempt to spew from scripture what eternal life is, You may say it is a bold attempt, I do not know that we should think so; surely we may well believe what the Lord says, and He tells us what it is, He says "This is the eternal life, that they should know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent", You may hear even God's people sometimes talking about what they <i>feel</i>, or what they are trying to <i>do</i>, or what they are aiming to be, but that is not it.<a name=109:4></a> "This is the eternal life, that they should <i>know thee, the only true God</i>" No doubt that personal pronoun -- "thee" goes back to the word "Father" in the first verse.<a name=109:5></a> He is speaking to the Father as such, and that word "thee" stands for the Father, who is "the only true God", If we speak of divine Persons in distinction we may speak of the Father, of the Son, and of the

		Now I apprehend, beloved (it is a very interesting point, though I can only just mention it, and it is peculiar to John), that salvation in John is a consequence of eternal life -- that is, <i>salvation from the order o f things here</i>.<a name=114:7></a> Let me give you a very well-known passage, <a href="../bible/John.htm#10:9">John  10:9</a>; "I am the door: if any one enter in by me, he shall be saved, and shall go in and shall go out and shall find pasture", What do you enter into when you enter in by Him as the door?<a name=114:8></a> I should say that you enter into <i>the sphere of eternal life</i>.<a name=114:9></a> You enter into the knowledge of the Father as the only true God, and more you enter into the knowledge of Jesus Christ, the sent One.<a name=114:10></a> I have not time to prove it by many quotations from John's writings, but you will find it to be so; salvation in the gospel of John follows in the train of eternal life.<a name=114:11></a> I think

		our brother Mr.<a name=115:1></a> Raven said, as it has often been said as to the gospel, that salvation follows in the train of righteousness, Well, that is true; but in John's gospel salvation follows in the train of eternal life.<a name=115:2></a> Take chapter 3: 14, 15, the Lord's allusion to the lifting up of the serpent in the wilderness: "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, thus must the Son of man be lifted up, that every one who believes on him may not perish, but have life eternal", Then verse 16: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believes on him may not perish, but have life eternal", Not a word about salvation yet, but now read verse 17 "For God has not sent his Son into the world that he may judge the world, but that the world may be saved through him", It is not a strange doctrine to scripture that salvation is the result of knowing God.<a name=115:3></a> There is a sort of intimation of it in the conversation of the Lord with the woman at the well in chapter 4 He said: "Ye worship ye know not what", There was no true knowledge of God; what did their whole system of worship amount to?<a name=115:4></a> Nothing, It had no basis, Then He says: "We worship what we know, for salvation is of the Jews".<a name=115:5></a> There was the true knowledge of God there, hence there was salvation there.<a name=115:6></a> Take the Old Testament scriptures, <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#27">Psalm  27</a>"Jehovah is my

		Well now, that is how these things are put in John's gospel; but before I pass on to those who receive eternal life and what is involved in it I would like to speak a word about the Giver.<a name=116:4></a> In the passage immediately before us the Lord Jesus is the Giver"that as to all that thou hast given to him, he should give them life eternal"; so in chapter 10: 28, "And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, and no one shall seize them out of my hand", the Lord Jesus as the Son of God gives it, and yet God gives it, Take <a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:11">1 John  5:11</a> "This is the witness, that God has given to us eternal life"; then he adds, "and this life is in his Son", "He that has the Son has life", God primarily is the Giver of eternal life, but He does not give it apart from Christ; and speaking again of Christ as the

		But we were speaking of how we get eternal life, We have light, and, I say, loose thoughts about this, because we do not give the blessed Spirit of God His place.<a name=119:10></a> It is not enough to have received the Spirit; we must give Him place.<a name=119:11></a> See what the Lord says about the living water.<a name=119:12></a> Speaking generally, we may say that the living water is the Spirit, but it is the Spirit in that special character; so He says, "The water which I shall give him shall become

		According to the positive statement of the Spirit of God in chapter 15 of the Epistle to the Romans, these prophecies by Haggai were written for our instruction.<a name=126:1></a> We are told there that "as many things as have been written before" (that really covers all the Old Testament scriptures) "have been written for our instruction"; and I am satisfied, beloved brethren, that there is very important and much-needed instruction for us in this Book of Haggai the prophet.<a name=126:2></a> I think the circumstances in which the earthly people of God were at the time of Haggai's prophecies are similar to those which surround us at the present time; or we might put it the other way and say, that the circumstances surrounding us at this present time, as God's people, are very similar to those existing at the time of Haggai the prophet.<a name=126:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, it is under these circumstances that God raised up the prophet Haggai and began to speak to His people, In the first instance He makes a very touching and yet a very solemn appeal to them, They were saying, the prophet tells us in the opening of this chapter: "These people say, The time is not come, the time that the Lord's house should be built", It is wonderful how cleverly people can talk about this and that matter as to the suitable and

		<a name=129>[Page 129]</a>

		unsuitable time for things of the Lord when they get interested in themselves, and have their own interests before them, They then imagine it is not the time to be interested for the Lord, and they do not like to be wakened up.<a name=129:1></a> Then came the word of the Lord to Haggai the prophet, saying, "Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your cieled houses, and this house lie waste?<a name=129:2></a>" What a solemn and yet touching appeal!<a name=129:3></a> There was the house of God lying waste, and they were busying themselves with building their own cieled houses, looking after their own comfort and interest.<a name=129:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I should like to say, with regard to the house of God, whether then or now, that you have two aspects of it, The one original builder of the house of Jehovah, the temple at Jerusalem, was King Solomon, the son of David, It is true that a certain preparation was made beforehand by David the king, and the Spirit of God gives him credit for all that he did in the way of gathering together the material; but the Spirit of God always attributes the building of the house to Solomon.<a name=129:5></a> Stephen says, "But Solomon built him an house", (Acts vii,) Now in that sense there was no other builder, but as we know from I Kings viii,, the house built and completed by King Solomon was dedicated to Jehovah, and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=130>[Page 130]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Jehovah signified in a wonderful way His appreciation of that house.<a name=130:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I would like to make a remark as to the continuity of that house in God's mind.<a name=130:2></a> We find it in the gospels -- the same house.<a name=130:3></a> I imagine that the act of that poor woman in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#21">Luke  21</a>, who cast in her two mites into the treasury, was more pleasing to God than perhaps all that Herod had done in connection with the rebuilding of the temple.<a name=130:4></a> So the house is maintained in continuity, and that is why I called your attention to the proper reading of chapter 2: 9.<a name=130:5></a> In the authorised version it reads: "The glory of this latter house", etc.<a name=130:6></a>, but it should read: "The latter glory of this house shall be greater than that of the former", There is only one house in God's mind.<a name=130:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I want to bring before you the fact that the house had lapsed into a ruined condition, and the time had come in the ways of God, and He stirred up the spirit of Cyrus, king of Persia, to have the house built again.<a name=130:8></a> I do not mean in the sense that Solomon built it; as I have said, there was only one builder in that sense; but it was to be set up again, it was to be brought out of that waste condition in which it was lying so that all that God connected with it might be established: all the thoughts of God, whether in connection with His own glory or with the blessing of His own people,

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=131>[Page 131]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		or still further with the outgoing of blessing -- because while in a sense it was Jewish, God never limited it to the Jews; for instance, when the Lord went into the temple, as recorded in <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#11">Mark  11</a>, He quoted the scripture "Is it not written, My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations?<a name=131:1></a>" In God's purpose there was always a group of nations around Israel, and God had blessing in view for all the nations in connection with that house.<a name=131:2></a> Now I think without any argument we might simply look at it as a fact, Not only Zerubbabel (Zerubbabel was governor of Judah at the time) and Joshua, who was the high priest, but the whole of the remnant had the wonderful privilege of building up that house; they had gone back for that ostensible purpose, but there had come in a decline, and they had been betrayed into this decline by a spirit of selfishness; they were occupied with their own ends, and the house of God was allowed to lie in this waste condition.<a name=131:3></a> What answers to this at the present time?<a name=131:4></a> There is the house of God, and just as of that material structure in the city of Jerusalem Solomon alone was the builder, so the Lord Jesus Christ is alone the builder of the house of God, He is the builder because in the Lord Jesus Christ you have the answer to both David and Solomon, In the days of His flesh, while He was here as a Man among men,

	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He gathered together the material; but that material was put together after the resurrection and exaltation of the Lord Jesus Christ to the right hand of God.<a name=132:1></a> The house has been built by God, and let me emphasise too the continuity of that house, for we have now passed from the types to the antitype; we have passed from that material structure in Jerusalem to that spiritual structure -- that wonderful building where Jews and Gentiles are built together for an habitation of God in spirit, or, to use the language of Peter in chapter 2 of his first epistle, "that spiritual house",
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But what has taken place?<a name=132:2></a> Well, in a sense, there has been an answer to what took place with the children of Israel.<a name=132:3></a> Speaking generally, there was something which answered, a number of years ago, to the return of the remnant from Babylon.<a name=132:4></a> God wrought, not now through a Cyrus king of Persia, or any king or earthly potentate for that matter, but God was pleased to take up His own vessel or vessels; indeed, one might speak of one particular vessel that He was pleased to take up, and there was inaugurated what really answers spiritually to a return from Babylon, Many beloved people of God were brought out here and there from the systems around them to the principles of His house; they were brought out -- to a clearer gospel?<a name=132:5></a> Yes, and that is all right so far as it

	<div class="paragraph">
		goes, but they were brought out with reference to the <i>house of God</i>.<a name=133:1></a> I know the truth of the Head in heaven was first seen, and then it was seen that His body must be here, and afterwards the truth as to the house of God came out; and I think in our day, if one might speak soberly, God has been pleased to give a great deal of light with regard to His house, not only with regard to it as a spiritual truth, but in a practical way so that there might be return to the principles of the house of God.<a name=133:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, now a word further, I venture to <i>say</i> this, and I beg you to receive it in grace, I think there has been that which answers a good deal to what was the case at the time of Haggai's prophecies, I think there has come in a spirit of selfishness, and the days in which our lot has fallen are days of material prosperity, and many advantages have been brought before the people of God with regard to advancing their interests here, and more or less there has been decline, so that at the present time I believe God is speaking in a very solemn way to us as His people, very much as He did through Haggai to the returning remnant from Babylon in his day -- speaking to us with reference to the house of God, I do not attempt to make very much application, only to bring it before you as the Spirit of God knows just where we are
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

		spiritually, each one of us, so that the Spirit of God might use the appeal.<a name=134:1></a> I do not care to use it on you, and I do not know that you would care to use it on me, but I would like to leave it with you and just to say that I believe the Spirit of God would bring it home to each one of us, so that there might be on our part what answers to verse 12.<a name=134:2></a> We find -- "Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the Lord their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the Lord their God had sent him, and the people did fear before the Lord", That is to say, there was an answer to the appeal, not only on the part of the leaders, the governor and the high priest, but on the part of the whole remnant.<a name=134:3></a> It says: "with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the Lord their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet",
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think we are too much in the habit (and so far it is right) of dwelling exclusively upon the one side of the truth of the house as built by the Lord Jesus Christ, and that many of us have used the truth of the house of God in that sense like a pillow to lie down and repose on, with the comforting thought that we are in and of the house of God, and that we are there as the Lord indicates, as sons (the son abides in the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, before going further, I should like to say this -- from the very first time that God had a house here in this world you will find that the truth of the house of God became a touchstone and a test of the condition of His people.<a name=135:3></a> For instance, we find decline and we find revival -- revival after revival -- in the history of God's earthly people, and you will always find this, that when there was a decline that decline was marked by neglect of the house of God, and when there was a revival that revival was marked by a profound interest in and exercise with regard to the house of God, I might instance, perhaps, that last and most wonderful revival in the days of Josiah.<a name=135:4></a> The house of God was in a dreadful condition; all manner of rubbish had accumulated there, and you remember how Hilkiah (the father of Jeremiah), the high priest, in connection with removing the rubbish from the house of God discovered the Book of Moses (<a href="../bible/2Kings.htm#22:8">2 Kings  22:8</a>)the book containing the mind of God, and it
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=136>[Page 136]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		was put into the hands of Shaphan the scribe, who carried it to the king, and it was read in the presence of the king.<a name=136:1></a> I only speak of it as emphasising this fact, that there was a wonderful revival, and that revival had its beginning in the interest which there was in the heart of the young king with regard to the house of God, He seemed to wake up to the fact that God's house was not what it should be, and in connection with this the book was found which contained the mind of God, and it became the occasion of a wonderful turning to God on the part of the people of God.<a name=136:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that was so then, and it has always been so.<a name=136:3></a> We find it with regard to the blessed Lord when He was here.<a name=136:4></a> Of Him you know it had been written in one of the psalms, and the disciples were able later on to recall it to their memory, in connection with the Lord's action, when He went into the temple (John ii,), how it was written concerning Him, "The zeal of thy house hath eaten me up", When the Lord was here He took up every interest of God, and there was a perfect answer in Him to the mind of God.<a name=136:5></a> I have already alluded to that action of the widow woman, (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#21">Luke  21</a>) I do not suppose it attracted any public attention, but the Lord Jesus Christ saw it, it came under His eye.<a name=136:6></a> He took great account of it
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=137>[Page 137]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and He declared that she had put in more than they all.<a name=137:1></a> So you see how the house of God became a test; if there was spiritual decline that decline was manifested in neglect of the house of God, and if on the other hand there was a work of God -- if there was anything like what would lead to a revival, there was great interest taken in the house of God.<a name=137:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence, I think it is a touchstone at this present time: it is a great test for us, we might well put the question to ourselves and to one another: "What is your interest in the house of God?<a name=137:3></a>" Are you so concerned about the house of God and that there should be among us that which would answer to going up into the mountain and getting the wood and building the house?<a name=137:4></a> (<a href="../bible/Haggai.htm#1:8">Haggai  1:8</a>,) This work was not official; it was common to all the remnant at that time; the word of the Lord to them was, "Consider your ways.<a name=137:5></a> Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house", It was Jehovah's house then, and God's house now is the "assembly of the living God", We have nothing in scripture about little models or reproductions of it, it is the house of God.<a name=137:6></a> It is true that the remnant in Haggai's time were only a little handful come back from Babylon, but that was for God's house; and the handful were interested in the house of God; and it is a great question for us -- how far are

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I should like to call your attention to the encouragement the Lord gives them, He appeals to them; He says, "Ye have sown much, and bring in little", Of course <i>we</i> have to take this up in a spiritual way.<a name=138:3></a> There may be great activities which do not come to much, You may see people busying themselves in various directions; and the people in Haggai's time <i>had</i> busied themselves; they had sown, they had eaten, they had drunk, they had clothed themselves, had earned wages, there were all these activities, but it had amounted to nothing -- the Lord says, "Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes", There was no satisfaction in that!<a name=138:4></a> I hope you will bear with me, and not misunderstand me, I am often asked the question what about this and that; what about Sunday schools, etc.<a name=138:5></a> But I say, have you got satisfaction, spiritual satisfaction?<a name=138:6></a> It is no use going on with bustle and stir in religious activities merely to keep

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, I want to go back to the first point, because there is wonderful encouragement in it: "Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house", There is not only the suitable material but there is the suitable place where the suitable material can alone be found, The house of God was not built with wood that was found in the valleys or by the river-side; it was in those mountain

		<a name=140>[Page 140]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		heights -- in those high altitudes that the material was found.<a name=140:1></a> I am sure there is a word for us in that, The house of God is not composed of earthly material, it is composed of heavenly material, The house was built here, but if I might be bold enough to say it, it was built from heaven and of heavenly material.<a name=140:2></a> It was the Holy Ghost who came down from Christ in glory that put the house together; and God has not changed His mind about the material that is to enter into the practical building of His house, for although it is not building it in the sense that Christ builds the house, it is building it in perfect <i>keeping</i> with that; it is the practical building of it, Jude says, "Building up your selves in your most holy faith", It is that side of things, There is the earnest seeking and desire to promote in our souls and in the souls of each other that which comports with the heavenly character of the house of God; you go up into the mountains, It requires some energy to go up into a mountain, and there must be <i>spiritual</i> energy.<a name=140:3></a> But I say that only by the way: I pass on to what I wanted to draw your attention to.<a name=140:4></a> God says, "Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith the Lord", It is your privilege and mine to contribute to that which gives

		You will find the answer to it in verse 12, and in verse 13 we read: "Then spake Haggai Jehovah's messenger in Jehovah's message unto the people, saying, <i>I am with you</i>, saith Jehovah", What has made the difference?<a name=141:6></a> There was a kind of distance between God and the people in the beginning of the prophecy -- He has to expostulate with them, and has really withheld His blessing from them, but the moment there is an answer to His appeal to them, Jehovah sends a special message through Haggai and says: "<i>I am with you</i>", We ought not to be content to rest short of that, I am sure I should be very sorry to say a word that would encourage pretension in any

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not want to give an address this afternoon but just to talk to you quite informally about the love of God.<a name=182:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the beginning of Luke's gospel we learn who the Lord Jesus Christ was as Man, Be was the Son of God.<a name=182:2></a> If you want to learn who He is as a divine Person you must go to John's gospel; <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:18">John  1:18</a> brings out that truth.<a name=182:3></a> But in Luke we learn who He is as Man.<a name=182:4></a> The Angel Gabriel said to Mary, "that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God".<a name=182:5></a> So when He was born God immediately owns Him in this peculiar way"Thou art my Son: this day have I begotten thee".<a name=182:6></a> (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:5">Hebrews  1:5</a>.<a name=182:7></a>) Now what marked Him as Man was this -- He was the Son of God.<a name=182:8></a> When He was baptized God opened the heavens and said, "This is my beloved Son", shewing that the Lord Jesus Christ was the peculiar object of the love of God, and He adds -- "In thee I have found my delight", shewing that there is in Him as Man a perfect answer to God's love.<a name=182:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=183>[Page 183]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How these two things mark Him!<a name=183:1></a> If you give your heart to any one, nothing would satisfy you but that they should answer to that love.<a name=183:2></a> What I want to bring before you is the Lord Jesus Christ as Man.<a name=183:3></a> Nothing was lacking in God's delight in Him; all His affection was concentrated on that Man, to whom He says: "Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight".<a name=183:4></a> But more than that, God found in that Man a perfect response to His love.<a name=183:5></a> I wish I could express what that must have been to God.<a name=183:6></a> He created man in perfect innocence; man was an innocent creature and there was a delightful intercourse between God and Adam.<a name=183:7></a> God walked in the garden, but then sin came in, and God lost all pleasure in that man and had to drive him out of the garden, and put a flaming sword at the gate of Paradise.<a name=183:8></a> About one thousand six hundred years ran on until you come to <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#6">Genesis  6</a>, and God looked down and we are told that "it grieved him in his heart".<a name=183:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then later we get the children of Israel, God separated them for Himself, and gave them the law and said, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart".<a name=183:10></a> Was there any response in man?<a name=183:11></a> Before Moses came down from the mount man had set up an idol.<a name=183:12></a> Man has never responded to God, he was only a disappointment to Him.<a name=183:13></a> God had set His heart

		on man but He got no response from him.<a name=184:1></a> But the Son of God came here into Manhood and God can look down on Him and say -- There is not only a Man on whom I can concentrate all My love, but there is One who answers perfectly to My love.<a name=184:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what is the point of Christianity?<a name=184:3></a> Why, to make you and me like that Man -- like the Son of God.<a name=184:4></a> In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:29">Romans  8:29</a> we are told that we are "predestinated to be conformed to the image of his Son".<a name=184:5></a> God has got that before Him; that is what Christianity means, and what the gospel means  --  that you and I should be like the Son of God, so that we might know and enjoy all God's love and answer to it.<a name=184:6></a> The great point of <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15">Luke  15</a>is that the Lord Jesus, who was the peculiar object of the heart of God -- the One who knew that love and was answering to it as no one else could -- that He tells out the heart of God.<a name=184:7></a> There is only one thing worth your while, or worth mine, only one thing worth knowing, and that is the heart of God -- to know God's love, and that He can fill your heart and mine.<a name=184:8></a> We like the sunshine and rejoice in it, but, beloved, what is it to have your heart lit up with the eternal sunshine of the love of God, and to have your heart responsive to that love.<a name=184:9></a> Issues are being raised now as to what we believe doctrinally; these questions are but

		as dust, the great thing is -- do you by the Spirit <i>know</i> that God is love?<a name=185:1></a> Has the sunshine of that love entered your heart?<a name=185:2></a> John, in his first epistle, says, "We have known and believed the love of God"; that is the point, for as you know it and believe it, your heart answers to it, and we love Him because He first loved us.<a name=185:3></a> Could anything be more simple?<a name=185:4></a> We all know how everything changes here, how disappointments and sorrows come in, but at all times there is the love of God, and that love is brighter than the sun.<a name=185:5></a> The sun will set tonight, but God's love has no sunset, no clouds or interruptions; there it is like eternal sunshine, it shines and shines on for ever.<a name=185:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15">Luke  15</a>we get really one parable in three parts, but all three are distinct; the shepherd is distinct from the father, but the shepherd is God the Son, the woman is God the Spirit, the father is God the Father -- there is distinction on the one hand but marvellous blending on the other.<a name=185:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And all is to bring out the heart of God!<a name=185:8></a> The Son of God came down here to express before man all that was in the heart of God; now He has died, has been raised from the dead, exalted and glorified.<a name=185:9></a> All the light of that love, and response to that love, has been left in this world, and now from Christ exalted the Spirit has come down and the love of God is

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What was the response?<a name=186:3></a> Look at Him in that dark moment in Gethsemane; the agony of His soul was so great that the sweat was as drops of blood.<a name=186:4></a> What did He say?<a name=186:5></a> "Abba, <i>Father</i>".<a name=186:6></a> In the heart of that blessed Man in that dark moment there was perfect response to the love of God.<a name=186:7></a> God takes us up and makes us sons.<a name=186:8></a> He has "sent forth the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father", that is, producing in our hearts the same response to Himself that was in the heart of Jesus, the Son of God.<a name=186:9></a> That is Christianity; and I assure you that nothing is worth your thought or mine but that your heart and mine should know the same love that He knew as Man here -- that that same love should fill your heart and mine with eternal sunshine and that there should be produced in your heart the same response as there was from His -- that "Abba, Father", the utterance of responsive affection should be begotten in your heart by faith and

		All God's love has come out in Jesus -- the Son of God.<a name=190:1></a> I see two things -- I see the love of God resting on Him, He has brought it to light in His Person, and I see in Him, as Man, a perfect answer to that love, and that is what God is seeking to effect with every one of us, to make us like that Man -- as we have borne the image of the earthy we shall bear the image of His Son.<a name=190:2></a> Cheer up, you are in good hands; God has got you in His hands, and He is working to one end, and that end is to make you like His Son, so that all the eternal sunshine of His love should shine into your heart, and that you might respond to it fully.<a name=190:3></a>

		NEW COVENANT MINISTRY
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#3">2 Corinthians  3</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My desire, beloved friends, in connection with the scripture we have just read is to bring before you a few thoughts in connection with the new covenant ministry.<a name=191:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have often thought what a great joy it must have been to the apostle to write this second letter to the Corinthian saints.<a name=191:2></a> We are not left to our imagination as to this, because the apostle states in this second epistle that he had written the first epistle to them in grief and anguish of spirit, and with many tears; but that epistle had not only reached them, but it had pleased the Lord to use it, so that they had taken a very sober account of themselves before the Lord; indeed, there had been wrought in those beloved saints at Corinth real repentance, so that with respect to all that concerning which the apostle had to write them in his first letter, and really to reprove and correct them, they had now thoroughly cleared themselves.<a name=191:3></a> I am sure one cannot read the two letters without perceiving the marked difference; the apostle is able, not
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=192>[Page 192]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		merely to unfold his own heart and affection for them in this second letter, as he was not able to in his first letter, but what is of greater importance than this, he is really free, in the hand of the Holy Spirit, and under the control and direction of the Lord, to set before them that which is (when we consider it spiritually), unmistakably in advance of what we find in the first letter, and in saying this there is not the least thought in one's mind of underrating the importance of what comes out in the first letter.<a name=192:1></a> So far as God's side of things is concerned (and there is God's side even in the first letter), there is no imperfection: the ministry which is found in the two epistles is absolutely perfect, and will ever abide in all its perfection.<a name=192:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To speak simply, you find in the two letters a threefold ministry.<a name=192:3></a> There is the ministry of the gospel in the first epistle; that is, the death, the burial, and the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=192:4></a> I do not dwell upon it, but one can scarcely pass it by without saying how wonderful is even the most elementary ministry of the gospel!<a name=192:5></a> How wonderfully is the truth of the death of Christ, with all that it means, brought out in the first epistle!<a name=192:6></a> It means, beloved, not simply as we are told in chapter 15, that Christ died for our sins -- it not only means an eternal ending of all our sins
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=193>[Page 193]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		in the death of Christ, but it means as we are told in the early chapters of the epistle, that Christ has been crucified for us, and not only have our sins all gone in the death of the Lord Jesus, but we ourselves as men according to flesh are gone too, all passed away from under the eye of God in the judgment of God as expressed in the cross.<a name=193:1></a> And then the Spirit, too, stands connected with the gospel ministry, as making good in the souls of the believers the divinely-intended effect of the death, burial and resurrection of Christ, though, so far as the resurrection side of the gospel is concerned, the first epistle puts our resurrection in <i>actuality</i>, and therefore in the future.<a name=193:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I want to call your attention to the ministry of the new covenant, which is -- I think one may say -- in advance of the gospel ministry, especially as it is unfolded in the closing part of the first epistle; and I think in this way the Spirit of God would intimate to us that these beloved Corinthians, having cleared themselves with regard to that which was connected with the flesh  -- with man according to the flesh, and hence, of course, with this world, are ready to be led on, and there is more than the <i>intimation</i> of this, there is the <i>recognition</i> of it, and that recognition takes shape in the ministry which the apostle
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=194>[Page 194]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		proceeds to unfold in his second epistle, in the portion of it that I have read.<a name=194:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I desire to speak simply; I am sure the more simply we can take account of the truth the more we shall be edified and helped by it.<a name=194:2></a> Theological terms operate like clouds to hide the clear, bright shining of the complete revelation of God in the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=194:3></a> The new covenant ministry, beloved friends, is a ministry of Christ; but it is not Christ dying for our sins, it is not exactly Christ crucified, as expressing the judgment of God upon man according to flesh, and of course the end of the world under the judgment of God; but it is Christ now as the expression of the heart of God, the love of God; that is what I understand by the new covenant ministry: it is the ministry of Christ as the One in whom there has come out a full disclosure of all that God is in His love toward us.<a name=194:4></a> But further -- even that does not answer fully to the new covenant ministry; it is, objectively, the unclouded light of the disclosure -- the revelation of God, the presentation to us of the heart of God, of all that God is in His love toward us.<a name=194:5></a> But the new covenant ministry is still more than that, because you cannot limit real ministry to that which is objective, to that which is on the part of God a matter of revelation, and which is consequently presented to us as <i>light</i>.<a name=194:6></a> Ministry has
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=195>[Page 195]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		also its subjective side, and whilst in a certain sense we may distinguish the two sides, I should seriously object to any separation of them: there is the ministry of that which we may speak of as objective -- outside ourselves, but that same ministry is in the power of the Spirit of God; hence, it has its subjective effect.<a name=195:1></a> I know, speaking commonly, that there is largely the thought that public speaking, preaching, or whatever it may be, is ministry; but if we paid attention to this chapter, we should see that it speaks about the ministry of the Spirit <i>and of its subjective effect</i>.<a name=195:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to convey to you the full thought of the new conversant ministry.<a name=195:3></a> It comes as light from the revelation of God; there is that which is objective -- God's love toward us -- and I need not tell you God's love toward us does not in any wise depend upon what may be true in us; it is true in <i>itself</i>, and it finds its perfect expression in the Lord Jesus Christ; but, as I have said, there is the other side of it, there is the Spirit, and His divine operation in ministering that which is revealed; that which is presented objectively in the Lord Jesus Christ -- the Spirit ministers to us, so that we may have the threefold effect of it.<a name=195:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first effect of new covenant ministry is that you are quickened, you are made alive;
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=196>[Page 196]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and we are made alive in our affections; to put it in the language of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>, "the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which has been given to us".<a name=196:1></a> Now I may think of God's love in connection with Himself, as that which is really the expression of the heart of God toward us as His children, but in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>it is the love of God shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost given unto us.<a name=196:2></a> That is new covenant ministry, and it is in this way that it operates to quicken us, to make us live; and it is a wonderful point, because it is life subjectively; and the effect is, there is response to the love of God; you love Him.<a name=196:3></a> It is a simple thing to state, but still it is worth stating: our attention has often been called to the fact that in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5">Romans  5</a>it is the love of God shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost given unto us, but chapter 8 is the answer to it -- we love God; we do not read much about God's love to us in chapter 8, that is in chapter 5, but what comes out in chapter 8 is that as the consequence of the Holy Ghost shedding abroad that love in our hearts there is a response to it; we love God.<a name=196:4></a> I know we speak of these things frequently, but, beloved brethren, who could overstate the importance of this?<a name=196:5></a> The fear is that we should come short in our hearts of answering to that wonderful love of God.<a name=196:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=197>[Page 197]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle says He has made us new covenant ministers, not of <i>letter</i> -- if you think of the new covenant in <i>letter</i> you are poorly off; of course we are not in a public way under the operation of the new covenant; the day is coming when God will make that new covenant with His earthly people here; and when He does it will be subjective in their case also, and it will have a marvellous effect upon them, there will be an answer in the hearts of Israel in a coming day to the love that is in the heart of God, they will love the Lord their God with all their heart, with all their soul, with all their strength and understanding; but if we only think of the new covenant ministry in letter, the apostle says, "For the letter kills, but the Spirit quickens".<a name=197:1></a> There is nobody so badly killed as the people who take up the mere language of these things and in a doctrinal or dogmatical way talk about them.<a name=197:2></a> The apostle says, "Who has also made us competent, as ministers of the new covenant; not of letter, but of spirit.<a name=197:3></a> For the letter kills, but the Spirit quickens".<a name=197:4></a> Then follows the parenthesis, and when he takes up the thread again he says, "Now the Lord is the Spirit".<a name=197:5></a> That wonderful Person, that blessed Person -- the Lord, He is the quickening, life-giving Spirit of the new covenant.<a name=197:6></a> Well, that is the first effect.<a name=197:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then further down you get liberty, "But
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=198>[Page 198]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty".<a name=198:1></a> There is not only life, but there is liberty.<a name=198:2></a> If I might attempt such an illustration, it is like Lazarus when he walked out of the grave, he had got life, but he had not liberty; the grave clothes had to be taken off so that this living man might enjoy in liberty the life he had received; so, "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty".<a name=198:3></a> It is not called the Holy Ghost, or the Spirit of God, in this chapter, it is "the Spirit of <i>the Lord</i>".<a name=198:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there is a still more wonderful effect, and that is the transforming effect of the ministry of the new covenant.<a name=198:5></a> "But we all, looking on the glory of the Lord with unveiled face, are transformed according to the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Lord the Spirit".<a name=198:6></a> How it stands out in blessed contrast to Moses!<a name=198:7></a> When Moses came down the second time the skin of his face shone with glory, and the children of Israel could not bear to look upon that glory-shining face, and so, when in the presence of the children of Israel, his face was veiled.<a name=198:8></a> But not so with the Lord Jesus, there is no veil on His face.<a name=198:9></a> Christ is the image of God, as we read in the next chapter, where, speaking about the glad tidings, the apostle says, "But if also our gospel is veiled, it is veiled in those that are lost; in whom the god of this world has blinded the

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=199>[Page 199]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		thoughts of the unbelieving, so that the radiancy of the glad tidings of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not shine forth for them".<a name=199:1></a> He is the image of God, and looking on the Lord's glory with unveiled face we are changed into the same image, we become like Christ here, and that takes place now, because <a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#3">2 Corinthians  3</a>is not dealing with the future, it is dealing with the saints in the present tine, and it is unfolding in a wonderful way the effect of the new covenant ministry, the effect of the ministry of Christ as the One in whom all that God is in His love toward us has been perfectly expressed, and we are now the subjects of that ministry in the power of the Spirit -- the Spirit of God.<a name=199:2></a> The apostle begins the chapter about the question of letters of commendation; he says, "Do we begin again to commend ourselves?<a name=199:3></a> or do we need, as some, commendatory letters to you, or from you?<a name=199:4></a> Ye are our letter".<a name=199:5></a> The saints were, Paul's letter of commendation; and where was that letter written?<a name=199:6></a> In Paul's heart, "<i>Ye</i>" (and the "ye" is emphatic) "are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read of all men, being manifested to be Christ's epistle ministered by us".<a name=199:7></a> The saints were Christ's epistle.<a name=199:8></a> What a wonderful thought that is!<a name=199:9></a> I am not so much concerned about preaching as I am concerned before the Lord
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that you and I should be in the good of these things in our souls by the power of God.<a name=200:1></a> "Ministered by us" -- he has ministered"written, not with ink" -- it is not a question of an outside kind of mark, what might be legible in the eyes of man, but "the Spirit of the living God; not on stone tables" (how hard were those stone tables!<a name=200:2></a>) "but on fleshy" (not fleshly) "tables of the heart".<a name=200:3></a> The writing on stone never effected anything; you know when Moses came down with those stone tables what a state of things there was at the foot of the mount amongst the very people to whom the stone tables were brought; those stone tables never produced one bit of response to God in their hearts.<a name=200:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"And such confidence have we through the Christ towards God: not that we are competent of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves, but our competency is of God; who has also made us competent, as ministers of the new covenant; not of letter, but of spirit.<a name=200:5></a> For the letter kills, but the Spirit quickens".<a name=200:6></a> Now let me tarry a moment here again with regard to the ministry of the new covenant, which is Christ as the One in whom all that, God is toward us has been expressed.<a name=200:7></a> It is to be deplored how largely Christianity so-called has become a matter of what is external -- of what is outward; or if not altogether what is outward, it
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=201>[Page 201]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		has become a matter of mere doctrine.<a name=201:1></a> Let me say, the all-important thing is the effect in <i>the heart</i>, and so the ministry of the Christ, who is the expression of all that God is toward us, is taken up, and that love is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost given unto us, and what is the effect of it?<a name=201:2></a> It quickens, it makes alive.<a name=201:3></a> We must not confuse things that differ.<a name=201:4></a> I do not wish to speak too critically, but the question of man's sins -- of man's guilt, and the question of righteousness is one, question; but, beloved friends, the question of life subjectively (not <i>objectively</i>, as is eternal life), but the question of life <i>subjectively</i> -- spiritual life -- that is, an answer in man's affections to the love of God, and to what there is in God's heart towards us -- well, the importance of this could not be overstated.<a name=201:5></a> A great many difficulties are encountered by souls simply because they have never been under the power of the new covenant ministry, and that is why, oftentimes, things are taken up in the way in which they are, in a kind of outward, hard and fast, doctrinal sort of way; but we need to have our hearts brought under the power of the love of God, so that there should be an answer in your affections and in mine to what is in the heart of God and what has found its expression in the death of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=201:6></a> Many of us break bread and take the cup every first day of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=202>[Page 202]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the week, but I do not know whether we are impressed with what we ought to be spiritually familiar with -- "This cup [the Lord's own language] is the new covenant in my blood".<a name=202:1></a> And what constitutes it the new covenant in His blood?<a name=202:2></a> Why, it is the expression of the death, the blood-shedding of the Lord Jesus Christ; it is not the expression of His death as accomplishing atonement; it is not the expression of His death in that character; it is the expression of His death as the full disclosure of the love that there is in the heart of God.<a name=202:3></a> "God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us".<a name=202:4></a> That is the quickening power of the new covenant ministry, producing an answer to this love in your heart.<a name=202:5></a> If there is an answer to it in your heart or in mine, if we really love God, it is the result of the Holy Ghost having shed the love of God abroad in our hearts.<a name=202:6></a> What a wonderful thing it is when we enter upon life!<a name=202:7></a> I mean subjectively!<a name=202:8></a> I do not mean in the full sense of eternal life -- that has its own sphere -- but what a wonderful thing when we really begin to live!<a name=202:9></a> It has been said we begin to live as we begin to love, and we begin to love as the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost given unto us.<a name=202:10></a> You might say that under the law God <i>commanded</i> love; He
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=203>[Page 203]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		claimed the affections of man's heart, but He never secured it under the law.<a name=203:1></a> "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, haying sent his own Son, in likeness of flesh of sin, and for sin [that was as a sacrifice for sin], has condemned sin in the flesh, in order that the righteous requirement of the law", etc.<a name=203:2></a> And what <i>is</i> the righteous requirement of the law?<a name=203:3></a> It could be summed up in one word -- love -- "that the righteous requirement of the law should be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh but according to Spirit".<a name=203:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would, beloved, that we were all clear about the new covenant ministry and the first effect of it, as really securing our affections for God.<a name=203:5></a> I could not express what the effect of it would be.<a name=203:6></a> How it would deliver many a believer from legality, to say nothing about doubts and fears and questionings -- how all that would disperse from the soul!<a name=203:7></a> What a change it would make to have the love of God shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost and in that way to have an answer to His love in our affections.<a name=203:8></a> What wonderful things are predicated of love!<a name=203:9></a> Love delights in its object; it delights in the will of its object; it delights in the pleasure and glory of its object.<a name=203:10></a> How we should learn in our souls the contrast of what Peter spoke of, referring to the law, when he said that it
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=204>[Page 204]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		was a yoke that neither they nor their fathers could bear; we should learn in contrast to that that the yoke of Christ is easy, and His burden is light.<a name=204:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I would like to speak for a moment of the other two effects of the new covenant ministry.<a name=204:2></a> There is the second effect, and that is liberty.<a name=204:3></a> "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty".<a name=204:4></a> I would like to be able to speak forcibly of the importance of spiritual liberty.<a name=204:5></a> How many believers are not free!<a name=204:6></a> Why?<a name=204:7></a> Because there is not in them the full effect of the new covenant ministry -- the ministry of Christ as the One who not only gives full expression to that love, but who, as Man, is the perfect exponent of the liberty that belongs to that love.<a name=204:8></a> How freely He moved!<a name=204:9></a> What a perfect delight the will of God was to Him!<a name=204:10></a> I speak of Him as a.<a name=204:11></a> Man down here.<a name=204:12></a> He could say: "I do always the things that are pleasing to him".<a name=204:13></a> He was Himself, on God's side, the expression of all that God is in His love towards us; but He was also the expression, as a Man, of the perfect answer to it.<a name=204:14></a> He was the exponent of that liberty that the apostle speaks of.<a name=204:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would speak a little further as to the third effect, that is, the effect brought out in the end of this chapter.<a name=204:16></a> When the apostle resumes in verse 17, and says: "Now the Lord is the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=205>[Page 205]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Spirit, but where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty", -- then he goes on: "But we all, looking on the glory of the Lord with unveiled face", etc.<a name=205:1></a> In the next chapter we have the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ .<a name=205:2></a>.<a name=205:3></a>.<a name=205:4></a> there is quite a difference between the glory of the Lord and the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.<a name=205:5></a> The glory of the Lord is that which distinguishes Him; and He is looked at, not as down here in the days of His flesh, but as the risen, exalted, and glorified Man, and His glory is, that even as the exalted Man, the glorified Man, He is the perfect expression of all that God is in love toward us; and indeed it is very interesting and instructive to notice how in the New Testament the connection, the indissoluble connection, is maintained in the language of the Spirit of God between the love of God and the Lord Jesus Christ: "Nothing shall be able to separate us (we are told) from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord".<a name=205:6></a> And, looking on the glory of the Lord, we are transformed into the same image.<a name=205:7></a> We become marked by that love of God; we become (I almost hesitate to say it) the exponents, in our measure, of that love of God.<a name=205:8></a> We are transformed according to the same image.<a name=205:9></a> It is the beginning now of that wonderful statement in connection with the purpose of God

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=206>[Page 206]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"whom he has foreknown, he has also predestinated to be conformed to the image of his Son".<a name=206:1></a> That wonderful work of transformation does not wait for the future, it begins now, it begins here: it is not, I need scarcely say, a question of the body now, the evidence abounds on every hand that our bodies are still mortal and very weak, but there is the inward effect of it, there is the inward transformation we "are transformed according to the same image .<a name=206:2></a>.<a name=206:3></a>.<a name=206:4></a> even as by the Lord the Spirit".<a name=206:5></a> It is not exactly the Spirit of God, it is by the Lord, because it is the power, not, so to speak, of the transforming agent, it is the power of the transforming object, and we all, looking on the glory of the Lord, are transformed according to the same image .<a name=206:6></a>.<a name=206:7></a>.<a name=206:8></a> .<a name=206:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have spoken of it very feebly, but I have spoken of it with this encouragement, that the Lord might be pleased to encourage us with it, and to bring our hearts under it, and into all the blessed effect of the knowledge of Christ as the perfect expression of all that God is in His love toward us, and the subjective power of it, not knowing it simply as a <i>doctrine</i>, but

		"If therefore ye have been raised with the Christ, seek the things which are above".<a name=223:3></a> The question is often raised -- What <i>are</i> the things above?<a name=223:4></a> I think the answer is this -- "He that seeks finds".<a name=223:5></a> If you do not know what the "things above" are, that is sure evidence you have not been seeking, because there is no such thing as seeking and not becoming acquainted with what you seek.<a name=223:6></a> It is really what is practical as the result of the subjective power of the truth that is before the mind of the Spirit of God in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3">Colossians  3</a>, and you can see how perfectly incompatible with the fact that we have died with Christ it would be to seek the things <i>down here</i>.<a name=223:7></a> You have done with the whole scene here, everything below is behind you; death has closed up the history of your connection with the things on the earth; <i>ye have died</i>.<a name=223:8></a> And what about your life?<a name=223:9></a> "Your life is hid with Christ in God".<a name=223:10></a> Now that is another peculiar and very beautiful feature of the truth in Colossians.<a name=223:11></a> You have got your life, but it is hid with Christ in God.<a name=223:12></a> Where is Christ?<a name=223:13></a> He is hid in God.<a name=223:14></a> Christ has gone out of sight so far as this world is concerned.<a name=223:15></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#12">John  12</a>you get the close of His public ministry in the solemn statement, "And going away, he hid himself from them";

		and He has been hid in God ever since.<a name=224:1></a> "When Christ is manifested who is our life, then shall ye also be manifested with him in glory".<a name=224:2></a> It is no question in Colossians of the manifestation of anything before the world.<a name=224:3></a> One has often said, and would say it carefully, that in Colossians there is neither testimony before man nor conflict with the power of evil; but our life is hid with Christ in God, and it goes straight on to manifestation in glory, for the first four verses are a complete paragraph.<a name=224:4></a> If you are manifested <i>here</i>, I say -- you are going to be manifested ahead of Christ.<a name=224:5></a> He was down here -- He was presented to man, but He was rejected .<a name=224:6></a>.<a name=224:7></a>.<a name=224:8></a> but He is going to appear in glory, and when Christ, who is our life, appears, we also shall be manifested with Him.<a name=224:9></a> It is not a question of being like Christ now in glory, "What we shall be has not yet been manifested; we know that if it is manifested, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is".<a name=224:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We have a twofold unfolding of His glory in chapter 1.<a name=224:11></a> There is what Christ is in relation to God and what He is in relation to the saints.<a name=224:12></a> As regards the first, He is "the image of the invisible God".<a name=224:13></a> Everything that could be made known of God has been made known in Him; as it is put in Hebrews, "Who being the effulgence [the outshining] of his glory and

		the expression of his substance".<a name=225:1></a> Then we have His relation to creation, and how it exposes the blunders of man in departing from the scriptures, when divine Persons are distinguished as they are in the creeds of Christendom, and they tell us that the Father created all things.<a name=225:2></a> When divine Persons are distinguished in the scriptures in connection with the creation it is the Son, not the Father, of whom it is predicated that "by him were created all things, the things in the heavens and the things upon the earth".<a name=225:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we come to His relation with the saints.<a name=225:4></a> There is a peculiar presentation of Christ in each epistle, and the way in which Christ is presented determines the character and scope of the application of the truth in each epistle.<a name=225:5></a> In chapter 1: 17 it says: "He is before all, and all things subsist together by him" (you are still in the region of the creation of God and His relationship to that creation).<a name=225:6></a> Then in verse 18: "And he is the head of the body, the assembly" (here we get His relation to the saints); "who is [the j beginning, firstborn from among the dead, that he might have the first place in all things".<a name=225:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Ephesians, where His resurrection and exaltation are unfolded, it says that God "gave him to be head over all things to the assembly, which is his body, the fulness of him

		<a name=226>[Page 226]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		who fills all in all".<a name=226:1></a> You can understand the Spirit of God making that prominent in Ephesians, because there we are in the presence of the vast scope of the counsels of God, the universe is in view, both heaven and earth, and so He has given Christ to be Head over all things, and no doubt it is in that capacity, if one might say so reverently, that He is Head of the assembly -- the body.<a name=226:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the statements of the Spirit in Colossians are confined to the body -- the assembly; that brings in the thought of the assembly as His body.<a name=226:3></a> I think perhaps we have been inclined to take an ecclesiastical view of the body, but I am sure in that we have been mistaken.<a name=226:4></a> You body is that in which you live.<a name=226:5></a> If I know anything about you, your character, your ways, I have learned it in your body.<a name=226:6></a> I am expressed as a man in my body, and you are expressed in your body.<a name=226:7></a> So the body of Christ is that in which Christ is to find expression here, not in the form of testimony; no doubt that is a testimony (there are plenty of scriptures for that), but so far as this epistle is concerned, Christ expressed in His body here is for the delight and satisfaction of the heart of God.<a name=226:8></a> And I think it is a wonderful, yet an exercising, thought.<a name=226:9></a> I do not know how far we have compassed it and given it a place in our souls, that as the body of Christ, the saints are here

	<div class="paragraph">
		when they went out to conflict they went out from Gilgal, and when they returned they returned to Gilgal -- it had to be maintained, and so the mortifying has to be maintained.<a name=229:1></a> Your members are here, and they are the only connection with earth that this epistle will allow; you have to put them to death, because if you do not, if there is not the maintenance in your soul of what this putting to death means, these members which are upon the earth will betray you into what will really hinder your soul.<a name=229:2></a> "In which ye also once walked when ye lived in those things".<a name=229:3></a> It is not contemplated that the saints are walking in these things, but where the connecting link exists (these members upon the earth) death must come in.<a name=229:4></a> Verse 8: "Put off, ye also, all these things, wrath, anger, malice, blasphemy, vile language out of your mouth".<a name=229:5></a> What are these exhortations based upon?<a name=229:6></a> They are based upon a spiritual fact, and that fact is that you have "put off the old man with his deeds".<a name=229:7></a> It is not simply what God did with the old man in the cross of Christ, though if God had not dealt with the old man in the cross of Christ, it would have been out of the question for you or me to deal with him; but this is our side -- you put off.<a name=229:8></a> "Having put off the old man with his deeds", you have learned the character of the old man, and you have

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, "having put on the new, renewed into full knowledge according to the image of him that has created him".<a name=230:7></a> Here it is the new man in the sense of <i>fresh</i>; in Ephesians it is the new <i>kind</i> of man, it is remarkable how the terms are transposed in the two epistles.<a name=230:8></a> In Ephesians it is "having put on the new man, which according to God is created in truthful righteousness and holiness", and the moment you bring in the thought of creation you have got something that did not exist before, you have got the new kind of

	<div class="paragraph">
		man -- you are renewed in the spirit of your mind.<a name=231:1></a> Here (in Colossians) you put on the new  -- that which is fresh -- and it is "renewed into full knowledge according to the image of him that has created him".<a name=231:2></a> The word translated "renewed" here is just the word that means in a way what the new man does in Ephesians; you are renewed here after the image of Him that created him, "wherein there is not Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondman, freeman; but Christ is everything, and in all".<a name=231:3></a> You are outside all the distinctions mentioned here -- religious,  -- circumcision or uncircumcision, bondman, freeman; you might actually be a poor slave, but you are outside of it, or you might be a master, but you are outside of it; you have come into that spiritual sphere where Christ is everything.<a name=231:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to come to these last verses just for a moment before we close.<a name=231:5></a> "Put on <i>therefore</i>, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, longsuffering; forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any should have a complaint against any; even as the Christ has forgiven you, so also do ye".<a name=231:6></a> The word "<i>therefore</i>" refers back to the beginning of verse 10, and as the exhortations preceding verse 10 are based upon the fact that you have
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=232>[Page 232]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		put off the old man, so these exhortations are based upon the fact that you have put on the new.<a name=232:1></a> "Put on <i>therefore</i>".<a name=232:2></a> It is practical, and comes out in our relationships one with another in the body of Christ.<a name=232:3></a> Now it is a matter of common experience that the closer the relationship the more you are tested by it, and so the Christians that put one to the test are not the Episcopalians, etc.<a name=232:4></a>, or those I do not walk with.<a name=232:5></a> I do not have anything to do with them, though, of course, I trust I carry about in my heart, by the grace of God, real affection for every Christian; but it is the people with whom I walk, the Christians with whom I am in close touch -- that is where the test comes.<a name=232:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let me call your attention to these terms elect, holy and beloved.<a name=232:7></a> They primarily apply to Christ as a Man down here; He was God's elect, God's holy One; He was God's beloved One; and the very titles applicable primarily to the Lord Jesus Christ as a Man here are taken up now and applied to His people.<a name=232:8></a> It is very touching, very wonderful"Put on therefore" as what?<a name=232:9></a> -- "<i>as the elect of God</i>".<a name=232:10></a> These traits were all true of Christ as God's elect One, God's holy and beloved One; how these things shone out in undimmed moral splendour in His Person!<a name=232:11></a>

		Then verse 14: "And to all these [add] love, which is the bond of perfectness.<a name=233:10></a> And let the peace of Christ preside in your hearts, to which also ye have been called in one body, and be thankful".<a name=233:11></a> Love is the bond of perfectness.<a name=233:12></a> It is a delightful thought to me that there is something down here that is the bond of perfectness; there is that which never fails  -- love never fails.<a name=233:13></a> "Let the peace of Christ preside in your hearts".<a name=233:14></a> What a wonderful thing among the saints in their relationship to each other in the body of Christ -- the very peace of Christ presiding.<a name=233:15></a> You know the idea of a presiding officer, he is in entire control, he

		Verse 16: "Let the word of the Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another".<a name=234:4></a> Our ability to teach and admonish one another depends upon the word of the Christ dwelling in us; how could we do is apart from that?<a name=234:5></a> It is Christ Jesus who has been made to us wisdom from God.<a name=234:6></a> Not one of us has any resources of wisdom in himself.<a name=234:7></a> "In psalms, hymns, spiritual songs".<a name=234:8></a> There are three varieties of praise, and I have no doubt they are in an ascending scale.<a name=234:9></a> There is great liberty, and while the unity of the body must never be forgotten there is variety.<a name=234:10></a> Psalms, hymns, spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God.<a name=234:11></a> What kind of singing is that?<a name=234:12></a> The singing in scripture is spontaneous.<a name=234:13></a> I love the thought of the spontaneity of Christianity.<a name=234:14></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>the Lord says, "The water which I shall give him shall become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life", and in <a href="../bible/John.htm#7">John  7</a>He speaks of "rivers of living water" flowing out.<a name=234:15></a> Paul says,

		<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:19">Hebrews  10:19</a> - 24
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two distinct thoughts in connection with Christianity; that is, the thought of privilege and the thought of responsibility; they are distinct thoughts, but they are connected thoughts, and I think the scripture I have read would serve to emphasise in our minds the divine order in Christianity.<a name=236:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The divine order in Christianity is first privilege, and then responsibility, and I think that the secret (if one may speak of that which is so plainly set forth in the scriptures as a secret) of ability to take up and fulfil the responsibility that belongs to us hinges upon the measure in which we apprehend and enter into and enjoy what is privilege.<a name=236:2></a> An unenjoyed privilege conveys no power.<a name=236:3></a> The principle of that scripture which we find in the Old Testament -- "The joy of the Lord is your strength", is true now.<a name=236:4></a> I may see that a certain privilege belongs to me as a Christian, and I may assent to it in my mind; but if there is not the enjoyment of it, I derive no strength from it.<a name=236:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let me say another thing that may perhaps be helpful.<a name=236:6></a> In taking up the scripture I have read it is of the greatest importance that everything connected with Christianity should be taken account of in a spiritual way; we
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=237>[Page 237]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		must drop from our minds every thought of materialism -- we are hindered by materialism to a much greater extent than perhaps we are prepared to acknowledge.<a name=237:1></a> I think it is a matter to be deplored that there seems to be so little ability to take account of spiritual things  -- that there is so little spirituality amongst us.<a name=237:2></a> It is only as we are spiritual that we can take account of things in a spiritual way.<a name=237:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The figures employed by the Spirit of God in the scripture I have read, especially in the first part of it -- that part of it which pertains to privilege -- are figures of material things "Having therefore, brethren, boldness for entering into the holy of holies".<a name=237:4></a> That, of course, to a mind acquainted with the letter of scripture brings before it that which was really material.<a name=237:5></a> We are speaking from Hebrews; there is nothing of the temple in Hebrews; there it is the tabernacle exclusively, and so the holy of holies would as a figure bring before us the west end of that tabernacle tent of the testimony of Jehovah.<a name=237:6></a> There was the court surrounding the tabernacle and inside those curtains which rested upon the sockets of silver, and then the tabernacle was set with the face of it toward the east; and there was a twofold division -- at the eastern end there was the holy place; there was the outer veil through which the priest must enter into the holy place;
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we must drop the figure; it is all right to get the thought of the Spirit of God in the figure, but you must not be detained in your mind by the materialism of the figure.<a name=238:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two statements about Christ -- one is a negative statement and the other is a positive statement; the negative statement is that Christ has not entered into the holy places made with hands -- and that is the end, for you and me, as Christians, of the material thing; but in the same chapter (chapter ix ) he says that Christ has entered into the holy of holies, so that there is that which the Spirit of God speaks of as the holy of holies, which is not at all material, but which is exclusively spiritual, and that is what we want to be concerned about, for it is a wonderful privilege, and I desire to speak very simply of it.<a name=238:3></a> I do not say too much about the holy of holies as figure, because there is that which is more important -- I mean that which the figure leads to.<a name=238:4></a> I know I read this passage years ago, and I used nearly always to find my mind struggling with the thought of the holy of holies, trying to grasp what it must mean for us Christians, and I found on looking more closely at the passage that I was not taking much account of what follows -- "Let us approach".<a name=238:5></a> You draw near

		I have a good word to say to every believer here tonight: it is a very encouraging thought that when you touch privilege in Christianity you touch that which does not belong to any exclusive class; in that way Christianity in this epistle stands in marked contrast to Judaism.<a name=239:8></a> In the first place there was the court of the tabernacle; then the tabernacle, and inside the tabernacle there was first the
