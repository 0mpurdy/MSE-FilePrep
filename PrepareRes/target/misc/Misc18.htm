		In view of the helpful character of the following letters, it has been thought desirable to reprint them, and we trust that the ministry of our late beloved brother will still be used of the Lord to the enlightenment and blessing of his people.<a name=2:1></a> It is considered desirable to emphasise the fact pointed out by the author, that the letters are copies of <i>actual correspondence</i> between himself and a brother who was seeking fuller light.<a name=2:2></a>

		Seeing that many of the Lord's people are desirous of knowing what is the teaching of Scripture with regard to baptism, and that many erroneous charges have been made against those who hold household baptism, it was thought well, instead of taking up the subject by way of treatise, to publish these letters as they were received from an inquirer, together with the replies as they were sent (substantially the same), hoping that in this way they might be used of the Lord to answer the queries of others who are passing through similar exercises.<a name=2:3></a> The compiler is answerable for the views expressed in the replies, and he desires to submit them to the test of Scripture, and to the prayerful consideration of his fellow-believers.<a name=2:4></a>

		In reply to your inquiry -- viz.<a name=3:3></a>: "Is it correct to say that the subject of baptism has been brushed on one side by common consent by those with whom you are associated as gathered to the name of the Lord?<a name=3:4></a>" I have to say that it is not in any sense correct to say so.<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On the other hand, I might say that the Scriptures present baptism as the act of the individual, and not as the act of the church, and by that I mean that the responsibility to baptise is that of the individual, and not of the church.<a name=3:6></a> This I know is not how you view it, but it may help to explain to you why we do not quarrel over it, nor yet brush it aside as unimportant.<a name=3:7></a> Speaking for myself, I attach much more importance to the <i>Name</i> in which it is done than to the manner of doing it, or the amount of water, or the person who does it, though I have no doubt about either the manner, or the person, or the subjects of it.<a name=3:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Scripture is clear that by it a person enters the profession of the faith, and that it is <i>in view</i> of salvation, and I am not aware that it is anywhere in the Scriptures connected with the assembly and the breaking of bread.<a name=3:9></a>

		Thanks for your note of the 28th ult.<a name=4:3></a> <i>re</i> 'Baptism'.<a name=4:4></a> I observe that the subject still holds a place in your teaching, and that it is incorrect to think otherwise.<a name=4:5></a> At the same time I must confess that the way you hold it, and the way I have apprehended the teaching of Scripture relating to the same, is very different.<a name=4:6></a>

		I admit individual responsibility (of course, a babe has none), that is, as the subject of it.<a name=4:7></a> (See <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#8:36">Acts  8:36</a> - 40, omitting verse 37, which has no authority).<a name=4:8></a> I further agree in saying it is not the act of the assembly, although I think the assembly is in view, see <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:41">Acts  2:41</a>: "Then they that gladly received his word were baptised: and the same day there were added .<a name=4:9></a>.<a name=4:10></a>.<a name=4:11></a> about three thousand souls".<a name=4:12></a> Certainly the Person to whom I am baptised is of vastly more importance than the way in which it is done, but Scripture leaves no uncertainty as to either.<a name=4:13></a> I think <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>is very definite: "Buried with him by baptism unto death".<a name=4:14></a>

		You say, 'A person enters the profession of the faith', but of what good is that unless he possesses it?<a name=4:15></a> Then you add, 'It is in view of salvation', but you do not tell me where to find this aspect of baptism.<a name=4:16></a> Of course, I know what you mean.<a name=4:17></a> It is bringing babies into the 'sphere of blessing', as your company term it.<a name=4:18></a> I may tell you candidly, I have looked through the Scriptures in vain for this peculiar circle.<a name=4:19></a> I cannot find the slightest trace of an infant being baptised.<a name=4:20></a> Households there are, but the attendant circumstances in every instance leave no room for speculating about their individual members.<a name=4:21></a> You are conversant with the cases in point, hence I do not quote the various passages.<a name=4:22></a> You cannot, however, say that Cornelius and his household were baptised 'in view of salvation', for they had received the Holy Spirit prior to that act.<a name=4:23></a>

		Dear Brother,

	<div class="paragraph">
		In view of your letter just received, it would be futile for me to attempt to show you the truth.<a name=5:10></a> You are perfectly satisfied that you have it.<a name=5:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If I cannot show you the truth, I can at least point out where you and others with you are in collision with the Scripture.<a name=5:12></a> I think your letter fairly represents the views of those who hold what you term "believers' baptism", that 'a person believes, is saved, and ought to be baptised'; also that 'he believes, has put on Christ by faith, and ought to show it by being baptised'; also that 'he believes, his sins are gone, and is baptised because of it', also that 'he believes, gets life and confesses it in baptism'.<a name=5:13></a> Some of your writers also teach that it signifies union with Christ.<a name=5:14></a> If this is a fair epitome of your views, I call your attention to <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#16:16">Mark  16:16</a>: "He that believeth and is baptised shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned".<a name=5:15></a> Here salvation follows baptism, and does not precede it, as you teach.<a name=5:16></a> This

	<div class="paragraph">
		scripture proves too much for those who hold "believers' baptism", for if the salvation of the soul is in question, no one can have his soul saved except he is baptised, for the order is, "He that believeth and is baptised shall be saved", and it conclusively proves that there is a salvation and a sphere of salvation other than that of the soul, though it does not necessarily exclude soul salvation.<a name=6:1></a> It does not say he that believes and is saved should be baptised, as you hold, and I submit that it answers your query as to where you will find that aspect of baptism where 'it is in view of salvation'; and more, I ask you and those who think with you to reconcile your views of baptism with this and other scriptures.<a name=6:2></a> <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3:27">Galatians  3:27</a> says, "As many as have been baptised unto Christ have put on Christ".<a name=6:3></a> Your thought is, 'As many as have put on Christ by faith ought to be baptised'.<a name=6:4></a> In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:38">Acts  2:38</a>, Peter says, "Repent, and be baptised every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ <i>for</i> the remission of sins"; not because their sins were already remitted, as you teach.<a name=6:5></a> In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#22:16">Acts  22:16</a> it is written: "And now why tarriest thou?<a name=6:6></a> arise and be baptised, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord"; he had believed, but his sins still attached to him in some way, and they are to be washed away by baptism.<a name=6:7></a> Clearly this is something different to the forgiveness of sins spoken of in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13:38">Acts  13:38</a>: "Through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins: and by him all that believe are justified from all things", etc.<a name=6:8></a> In <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#3:21">1 Peter  3:21</a> baptism saves.<a name=6:9></a> How does it save?<a name=6:10></a> Certainly it cannot save the soul, yet it saves!<a name=6:11></a> To sum up: In Mark, the salvation comes after the baptism, not before it; in Galatians, Christ is put on <i>in</i> baptism; in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>they are to be <i>baptised for</i> the remission of sins; in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#22">Acts  22</a>sins are washed away <i>in</i> baptism, and in 1 Peter baptism saves.<a name=6:12></a> All these scriptures clearly demonstrate the aspect of baptism where it is in view of salvation, and not because the subjects of it were in salvation, as you contend.<a name=6:13></a> In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:3">Romans  6:3</a>, 4, it is "baptised <i>unto</i> his death" -- "buried with him by baptism <i>unto</i> death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead .<a name=6:14></a>.<a name=6:15></a> we also should walk in newness of life"; that is, "buried .<a name=6:16></a>.<a name=6:17></a>.<a name=6:18></a> unto death" -- in <i>view of walking here</i>

		"in newness of life", (You surely do not bury believers, that is <i>living</i> persons, do you?<a name=7:1></a>).<a name=7:2></a> They are not buried because they are already walking in newness of life, but in view of doing so here in this world.<a name=7:3></a> I am afraid I have to say you <i>bury</i> persons <i>alive</i>; that is, you bury them <i>because</i> they are believers.<a name=7:4></a> Scripture buries the same persons, not because they are believers (though they may be such), but because they have found out that they are sinners under the sentence of death.<a name=7:5></a> They have discovered that which has been always true of them.<a name=7:6></a> "If one died for all, then were all <i>dead</i>".<a name=7:7></a> You bury <i>living</i> persons, Scripture never.<a name=7:8></a> You connect baptism with soul salvation and life eternal; Scripture connects it with provisional or administrative forgiveness, which relates to my path on earth, and it has nothing to do with soul salvation and fitness for heaven.<a name=7:9></a> You say a person believes, is saved and ought to be baptised.<a name=7:10></a> Scripture says, "He that believes and is baptised shall be saved".<a name=7:11></a> Which is right?<a name=7:12></a>

		Seeing that you have <i>reversed Scripture</i> order as to <i>adults</i>, it is useless to talk to you about children, but since you admit that Scripture recognises <i>household baptism</i>, you give yourself away without knowing it.<a name=7:13></a> You ask, 'What good is it for a person to enter the profession of the faith unless he possesses faith?<a name=7:14></a>' I ask, How do <i>you know</i> who <i>possesses</i> faith?<a name=7:15></a> You necessarily have to take every person upon his profession, and not upon his possession.<a name=7:16></a> Perhaps you will say that Philip was wrong when he baptised Simon.<a name=7:17></a> From your point of view I should say that was a case of "believers' baptism", for "Simon himself believed also" and "he was baptised".<a name=7:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As I have said before, there is no such thing in Scripture as "believers' baptism".<a name=7:19></a> Of necessity every adult responsible person must receive God's testimony, or if you like, he 'must believe' before he can be baptised, but Scripture invariably connects it with the judgment of God due to the <i>sinner</i> as such, and not with his state as a <i>believer</i>.<a name=7:20></a> As in the reality, so in the figure, one must have part in Christ's death in order to have part in His life; I do not live to die, but die in order (or with a view) to live.<a name=7:21></a> "In

		They were "sinners" who came to John's baptism; sinners who "justified God, being baptised with the baptism of John; but the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptised of him"; again "baptised of him in Jordan, confessing their <i>sins</i>".<a name=8:5></a> They were sinners who were called upon in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>to repent and be baptised.<a name=8:6></a> Saul in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#22">Acts  22</a>was the man who had persecuted the saints of God and though he had doubtless submitted himself to the Lord and received His forgiveness, he is told to be baptised and wash away his sins; that is, to disassociate himself from all that with which he had been connected as a persecuting Jew.<a name=8:7></a>

		time I have seen a little further.<a name=9:1></a> I can see clearly now that it is not in the capacity of believers that they are baptised, but as sinners.<a name=9:2></a> At the same time, notwithstanding the difficulty in <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#16:16">Mark  16:16</a> (which I am unable to explain so far), I think it essential that a person should profess faith in Christ before baptism.<a name=9:3></a> I have observed that when Peter presents baptism he connects it with repentance "for the remission of sins", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>.<a name=9:4></a> This, I apprehend, was the administration of forgiveness by the assembly in a public way, such power having been conferred in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>; that is, in a regular way; of course saints are not infallible, and might make a mistake in receiving one not really saved; but does not absolute forgiveness precede this?<a name=9:5></a> Were not Paul's sins gone when he owned Jesus Lord on the Damascus road?<a name=9:6></a> Of course publicly when baptised and put in his place amongst the saints.<a name=9:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not deny household baptism, but I find in every instance the attendant circumstances would forbid the idea that children were amongst the number.<a name=9:8></a> For instance, the Philippian jailor's household "rejoiced, believing in God", so that no matter how young they were or how old, they certainly had faith in Christ.<a name=9:9></a> In the case of Lydia you have to suppose that she was a married woman with children.<a name=9:10></a> This is hardly probable since she is so far from home and on business.<a name=9:11></a> Then Paul enters her house and comforts the <i>brethren</i> (not babes), <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16:40">Acts  16:40</a>.<a name=9:12></a> In chapter 18: 8, Crispus "believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed and were baptised".<a name=9:13></a> There again faith precedes baptism in the household of Crispus.<a name=9:14></a> Lastly the household of Stephanas; we see from <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#16:15">1 Corinthians  16:15</a> that they addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints.<a name=9:15></a> This, of course, could not be done by children.<a name=9:16></a> I have already referred to the household of Cornelius: baptism followed faith in this case, did it not?<a name=9:17></a>

		I find that it is with you as it was with myself; that is, that there is much to unlearn before one is in a position to apprehend the truth.<a name=10:8></a> For instance, you speak of baptising <i>children</i>.<a name=10:9></a> This is misleading.<a name=10:10></a> The Scripture does not so speak, neither do we.<a name=10:11></a> 'Children' is a general term, and includes all children, and the inference is in many minds that all children are referred to.<a name=10:12></a> This is not so.<a name=10:13></a> Again you speak of <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>as conferring power to administer forgiveness of sins by the <i>assembly</i> in a public way.<a name=10:14></a> I do not think this is correct.<a name=10:15></a> Administrative forgiveness by the assembly refers, I think, to the sins of saints and not to the sins of sinners.<a name=10:16></a> The church neither teaches, nor preaches, nor does it baptise; neither do I assent to your thought that baptism puts the person in his place amongst the saints, if by this you mean the assembly.<a name=10:17></a> In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>(the scripture you refer to) the assembly as such is not in view; that is, the truth of it had not been made known.<a name=10:18></a> The only mention of it is in the last verse, where the <i>Lord</i> added to the church such as should be saved.<a name=10:19></a> Verse 41 says, "They that gladly received his word were baptised: and the same day there were added (unto them) about three thousand souls.<a name=10:20></a> And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine

		and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers".<a name=11:1></a> There was a real and blessed work of the Spirit of God, and no doubt all was in beautiful order, but the truth of the assembly had not been made known, though the thing itself was there.<a name=11:2></a> In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#3">Acts  3</a>Peter promises the return of the Lord if the nation would repent.<a name=11:3></a> In chapter 7 Stephen's testimony to an exalted Christ is rejected, and thus the message is sent after Him, "We will not have this man to reign over us".<a name=11:4></a> Up to this point we have what is mainly connected with the kingdom, rather than the church, and the state of things was transitional.<a name=11:5></a> I think you will find that it is the kingdom that is mainly preached all through the Acts, and in the last chapter, verses 22 and 23, it is the kingdom and the things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=11:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In baptism a person is brought under the rule or authority of the Lord; but this is quite distinct from being brought into the assembly.<a name=11:7></a> Peter's testimony was that God had made Jesus, Lord and Christ; and the Lord Himself says, "All power has been given me in heaven and in earth.<a name=11:8></a> Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptising them to the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have enjoined you".<a name=11:9></a> Again God has decreed that every knee shall bow to Him, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.<a name=11:10></a>

		I agree with you that it is essential that an adult person should profess faith in Christ before baptism; that is, he discovers himself to be a sinner; but the testimony of God is presented to men and women (responsible persons), not to young children who are unable to receive anything; at the same time what is true of a man when he received the testimony of God was <i>always true</i> of him so far as baptism typified; he has found out that death as the judgment of God lay upon him, but <i>it was none the less on him before he found it out</i>.<a name=12:11></a>

		Dear Brother,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think the kingdom connects itself with the rule or authority of the Lord; the house with the dwelling place of God by the Spirit.<a name=18:3></a> One must first be brought under the sway of the Lord in grace, and for this new birth is necessary: "Except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God".<a name=18:4></a> Then Christ is presented to him as the One who died and rose again, and whom God has exalted; that is, in resurrection He is made Lord and Christ (declared as such).<a name=18:5></a> That place He reached through death.<a name=18:6></a> The testimony of God is that He died for <i>all</i>, and that He died for <i>me</i>.<a name=18:7></a> In baptism <i>I</i> accept that testimony, but it is none the less true that He died for <i>all</i>, and as the Scriptures say, if that be so, "then were all dead".<a name=18:8></a> Did Jesus die for my child?<a name=18:9></a> He died for me, and in baptism I accept death.<a name=18:10></a> Can it be that if He has died for me and for my child, that <i>I</i> only accept His death and come under Him and leave my child behind under sin?<a name=18:11></a> "Go now ye that are men and serve the Lord", said Pharaoh; Moses said, "We will go with our young and our old, with our sons and our daughters".<a name=18:12></a> I repeat again that one does not come outwardly under Christ by <i>faith</i>; with the heart man believeth unto righteousness (that is, Godward), with the mouth confession is made unto salvation (that is, manward); he comes into the good of salvation by confession, and not by faith.<a name=18:13></a> This, of course, is that which is real and vital; but the same order is preserved and the same truth taught in the figure.<a name=18:14></a> The publicans justified God (that is, they condemned themselves), and were accounted righteous, and they accepted death in baptism.<a name=18:15></a>

		But to return to my child.<a name=18:16></a> Is there any scripture to warrant me in bringing up my child in the faith of <i>Christ</i>?<a name=18:17></a> Note the words, that does <i>not</i> mean bringing him up as one who is <i>outside the faith of Christ until he believes</i>, which is what your teaching necessitates.<a name=18:18></a> I need hardly quote you the many scriptures in this connection for they will readily occur to your mind; <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#6:1">Ephesians  6:1</a> - 4;

		In answer to your question, 'Does a child put on Christ in baptism?<a name=19:7></a>' I would remind you that <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3:27">Galatians  3:27</a> is specially addressed to adult believers, as other scriptures of like import, but what is actually true of such is true in principle of children; with the Galatians it was a question of law or the faith of Christ, not faith in Christ, but the faith of Christ, into the profession of which they had come, not by believing (that is faith <i>in</i> Christ), but by baptism.<a name=19:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		You ask, 'Does baptism signify dissociation in their case?<a name=19:10></a>' I believe you will find it is invariably so in the Scripture, with a view to being associated with someone, or something else.<a name=19:11></a> This is very clear in John's baptism.<a name=19:12></a> They confessed the sins of the nation to "believe on him which should come after him", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#19:4">Acts  19:4</a>.<a name=19:13></a> The same in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>, they left one system to come into another.<a name=19:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In your own case, presuming that you had never been baptised, I should judge the order was scriptural, but supposing baptism omitted, as you suggest, I should say the position was anomalous.<a name=19:15></a> You had got into the profession, but not by the proper door.<a name=19:16></a> The inconsistency is shewn in the case of one who has been brought up in the profession, for years a true believer, then he desires fellowship in the Lord's supper.<a name=19:17></a> He has now to take his place among the sinners who confess their sins, in figure accept the death of Christ, and come again into the place which he has occupied for years.<a name=19:18></a> He is, as it were, put out of the window in order that he may come in by the door.<a name=19:19></a>

		You ask if we 'limit fellowship to those baptised?<a name=20:1></a>' If you mean fellowship in the breaking of bread, we should not receive any person who refused to be baptised; many with us do not see the full force of baptism, but that does not hinder fellowship in the Supper.<a name=20:2></a> You, on the other hand, require a person to accept adult baptism, and I am told it is a condition of fellowship.<a name=20:3></a> In this you are more sectarian than the Baptists, for they do not impose it for fellowship, but for membership.<a name=20:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In reply to another question, I judge that the Lord is the Administrator of the forgiveness of sins, but baptism is done in His name (that is, by His authority), as well as <i>to</i> the name of Father, Son and Spirit.<a name=20:5></a> He authorises one to do it.<a name=20:6></a> <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#28:19">Matthew  28:19</a>; <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#16:15">Mark  16:15</a>, 16.<a name=20:7></a>

		Baptism is unto death with a view to life; while it signifies death only, it is with a view to resurrection.<a name=20:8></a> He died that He might rise again, not to remain in death.<a name=20:9></a> <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:4">Romans  6:4</a>, says: "Buried with him by baptism unto death, that .<a name=20:10></a>.<a name=20:11></a>.<a name=20:12></a> we also should walk in newness of life", so in verse 6, "<i>that</i> henceforth we should not serve sin".<a name=20:13></a> The children of Israel went into the Red Sea, not to remain there, but to come out on the other side.<a name=20:14></a> They were baptised unto Moses in the sea, not in coming out, though they did come out.<a name=20:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:12">Colossians  2:12</a>, the scripture becomes plain if you remember that the apostle is writing to persons of whom the thing stated is <i>actually</i> true, as distinguished from that which is true in principle only.<a name=20:16></a> An instance of this may be seen in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10">1 Corinthians  10</a>, there it is the bread which we <i>break</i>, in chapter 11 it is the bread which we <i>eat</i>, we are always those who are <i>breaking</i> bread, but we eat only when we come together.<a name=20:17></a> That is, in principle we are those who break bread, in practice we break bread once a week.<a name=20:18></a> So far as the <i>teaching</i> concerning baptism goes, what is true, or should be true, in fact of the adult, is true in principle of the child.<a name=20:19></a>

		There is, however, another aspect of the kingdom which is presented in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13">Matthew  13</a>; this is dispensational or positional.<a name=23:6></a> "The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way".<a name=23:7></a> In the explanation it is said, "He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man; the field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one".<a name=23:8></a> In chapter 16 the keys of this kingdom are given to Peter.<a name=23:9></a> Chapter 18 provides a place for the children in the kingdom of heaven: "Jesus called a <i>little child</i> .<a name=23:10></a>.<a name=23:11></a>.<a name=23:12></a> and set him in the midst of them, and said .<a name=23:13></a>.<a name=23:14></a>.<a name=23:15></a> Except ye be converted, and become as <i>little children</i>, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.<a name=23:16></a> Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this <i>little child</i>, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.<a name=23:17></a> And whoso shall receive one <i>such</i> little child in my name receiveth me".<a name=23:18></a> In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>the King is in heaven, and Peter, the man with the keys of the kingdom, uses one of them and opens the door to let in repentant Jews and <i>their children</i>.<a name=23:19></a> He says, "Repent, and be baptised every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.<a name=23:20></a> For the promise is unto you, and to your children", referring to <a href="../bible/Joel.htm#2:28">Joel  2:28</a>.<a name=23:21></a> Clearly the door is opened for the children as well as for the parents; and if he is authorised to open the door, who is going to shut it?<a name=23:22></a> and if it is opened, why may they not enter?<a name=23:23></a> The wicked fathers

		With regard to the house of God I can quite see your thought in the way you distinguish between the temple proper and the precincts.<a name=26:18></a> These are always distinct in the Greek, but both included in the term "house of God".<a name=26:19></a> I never thought of bringing this distinction into the assembly when viewed as such, but this is clearly implied.<a name=26:20></a>

		not baptised in the capacity of believers, but that of sinners; that it signifies dissociation and is connected with provisional or administrative forgiveness, but I am not just as clear on this point as I should like.<a name=27:1></a> Some of the brethren say that this was only for Jews, even essential for their souls' salvation; others say they could not receive the Spirit without it.<a name=27:2></a> I could not accept this, as it would be a denial of the efficacy of the blood of Christ.<a name=27:3></a> From <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:38">Acts  2:38</a>, it would appear that baptism was in view of receiving the Spirit.<a name=27:4></a> Could it be proved that Paul did not receive the Spirit until after he was baptised?<a name=27:5></a> <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:17">Acts  9:17</a> would, I think, show that he received the Spirit when his eyes were opened, and of course baptism followed.<a name=27:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I can see that a man is not viewed as a Christian outwardly until baptised -- that in it he puts on Christ; <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3:27">Galatians  3:27</a>, or as in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>, buried with Him by baptism unto death, in order to walk in newness of life; that it does not apply to the soul and going to heaven, but in view of living upon earth; that it saves (only in figure, I presume) according to <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#3:21">1 Peter  3:21</a>.<a name=27:7></a> I notice, too, that in John's gospel, where the great theme is eternal life and the Spirit, there is no mention of baptism; nor yet in the commission (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:47">Luke  24:47</a>), there I apprehend it is the soul that is in question.<a name=27:8></a> This alone would refute the idea of baptism being essential for the soul salvation of a Jew, since this is the very message that has to be preached, beginning at Jerusalem.<a name=27:9></a>

		As to 'household' I cannot see sufficient warrant for baptising households where the testimony of God has not first been received.<a name=27:11></a> For a household would embrace not only the children, but all under the authority of that person, so as to be called his house.<a name=27:12></a> This would mean servants, regardless of age or belief.<a name=27:13></a> Thus you would be baptising adults where there was no faith in the testimony, whereas you maintain in your letter of May 25th that 'it is essential that a person should profess faith in Christ before baptism', meaning, of course, adults.<a name=27:14></a>

		In reply to your difficulty as to household baptism, no one has said that <i>all</i> in a believer's house <i>must</i> be baptised, neither do I think so for a moment, and I adhere to the statement of <a href="../bible/May.htm#25">May  25</a>th, that it is essential for an adult to accept the testimony before baptism, but that does not touch the question at all; in the case recorded it says, "Was baptised he and all his", not all <i>in</i> his house, and if there were adults, slaves or otherwise, subjection to Christ is implied.<a name=28:15></a> You must also remember that there is a difference between the rejection of the testimony by persons

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#6:1">Ephesians  6:1</a>, "in the Lord" does not connect itself so much with the child as with the obedience -- the obedience is in the Lord.<a name=29:4></a> The children of Christian parents are to be brought up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, and the obedience is in the Lord; the normal condition of things is contemplated; if things do not fit it is proof that something is out of gear, and we should conform to the Scripture instead of trying to make it conform to our condition.<a name=29:5></a> And why should you speak of an 'unsaved' child; "The promise is unto you, and to your children", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:39">Acts  2:39</a>.<a name=29:6></a> To faith my children are not unsaved.<a name=29:7></a> I may have but little evidence of their conversion, but faith does not reckon them unsaved; neither do you, for you admit that the work of the Lord avails for children.<a name=29:8></a> Can you tell me when it ceases to avail?<a name=29:9></a> <i>You</i> accept the death of Christ for them 'as far as heaven is concerned', and then you refuse to them that which is only a figure of that death.<a name=29:10></a> Where have you a "Thus saith the Lord" for this?<a name=29:11></a> You accept the reality without a text, but you demand a 'text' for the figure of the reality.<a name=29:12></a> It is by inference alone that you can say that children go to heaven in virtue of His death, yet you deny to them the figure of His death.<a name=29:13></a> Again, you accept 'the death of Christ for children as far as heaven is concerned'.<a name=29:14></a> Why should you refuse that same death as far as earth is concerned?<a name=29:15></a> Surely if your faith can appropriate heaven for them, and that without a 'text', it is a small thing to appropriate Him for them and them for Him while here on earth.<a name=29:16></a> Your reasoning is not sound; you give them a place permanently in heaven and refuse them a place provisionally on earth.<a name=29:17></a> I judge the reason is that you still unconsciously make baptism subjective instead of objective.<a name=29:18></a>

		More than that, water signifies death; much or little is not the point.<a name=30:7></a> What is done in the Lord's name cannot be set aside though it be done informally.<a name=30:8></a> Though only sprinkled, the water signifies death, the quantity is of secondary importance.<a name=30:9></a> In the present confused state of things, while seeking to follow the right oneself, we have often to accept that which is deficient in others.<a name=30:10></a> Again, what is done cannot be undone, neither can it be done again.<a name=30:11></a> In baptism one <i>enters</i> the profession of the <i>faith</i>, whether as an infant or adult; being in it you cannot put him out of it, neither can you bring him in a second time.<a name=30:12></a> It is useless to say he came in informally, and you cannot say he is not in.<a name=30:13></a> The reason why you press baptism is that you connect it with the Lord's supper and make it refer to the <i>subjective</i> state of the person baptised, instead of connecting it with the profession of <i>the faith</i> and the Lord's death.<a name=30:14></a> It is "unto", not "into" death.<a name=30:15></a> The subjective state is the same in every one, "There is no difference, for all have sinned".<a name=30:16></a>

		The test for the Jews in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>was the confession of the Christ; and baptism in their case was the witness to the reality of the confession; they were pricked in their heart, accepted death, and the Spirit followed the remission of sins.<a name=30:17></a> In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#10">Acts  10</a>the Spirit comes first because of the prejudice of the Jew.<a name=30:18></a> Ordinarily the order is "after that ye <i>believed</i>, ye were sealed", but that has nothing to do with baptism.<a name=30:19></a>

		My dear Brother,
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		After careful consideration and deep exercise regarding what you have brought before me in your letters concerning baptism, I am now free to state my mind as to same.<a name=31:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think it is clear that baptism in no way connects itself with the subjective state of the believer, as contended for by those who hold what is known as "believers' baptism", but has to do with my outward position on earth.<a name=31:3></a> I can see that those who accepted the testimony of God were not baptised because they were believers and had life, but because they were sinners and were under the judgment of God, baptism dissociating them from their sinful course and outwardly terminating that course, putting them in a new one where they are to <i>walk</i> in newness of life.<a name=31:4></a>

		But if an adult in figure gets clear of Egypt (the world) by waters of the Red Sea (baptism) it can be the only way through which his child can get free from it.<a name=31:5></a> "All were baptised unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10">1 Corinthians  10</a>.<a name=31:6></a> Thus the children in the faith of the parent were carried through death and brought in figure to the place where God is known and owned.<a name=31:7></a> "By faith they passed through the Red Sea" could only apply to adults, as does the testimony of God today, but that testimony provides a place for the children, too, and it is this place which the parent appropriates in the faith of his soul for his child in committing it to death in baptism, which he owns as the judgment of God upon the sinful man, which he refuses to perpetuate here morally.<a name=31:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The child is thus brought up as within the sphere where the Lord's authority is owned, and in the light of God, not in the darkness which characterises the world.<a name=31:9></a> That this principle runs through Scripture cannot be denied.<a name=31:10></a> "Thou and thy house" is the divine order, and if in the past dispensations God has been pleased to associate the household with its head, we cannot conceive of Him separating them when we come to Christianity, "for the promise is unto you, and to your children".<a name=31:11></a>
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That households were baptised cannot be disputed, and Scripture shows clearly that this was not on account of the faith of each individual, but on account of the faith of the head of the house.<a name=32:1></a> "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house".<a name=32:2></a> The household was his, and he submits it to the Lord's authority by baptism, as he himself in like manner had outwardly come under that authority.<a name=32:3></a> Thus his children were positionally or outwardly brought out of Judaism or heathenism and put in touch with the Christian company where every Christian privilege was found, and all this lay open for the children, even though they might not enter or appropriate it.<a name=32:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The point is, the Lord's authority is owned in baptism, the judgment of God is accepted, and in this way the household is submitted to that authority.<a name=32:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am, and shall ever be grateful for what you have brought before me, dear brother, and am thankful that the truth of baptism has found its right place in my mind.<a name=32:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Yours affectionately in the Lord, ______________
