		P.L.<a name=1:1></a> We have the subject of leadership before us, if the Lord will.<a name=1:2></a> We looked at it in relation to Christ in the gospels yesterday, bearing upon the glory of a descending Leader, the true Hebrew Servant who said, "I love my master, my wife, and my children, I will not go free" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#21:5">Exodus  21:5</a>).<a name=1:3></a> God's standard for leadership, as in everything else, must be Christ.<a name=1:4></a> In Christ's absence He sovereignly raises up leaders who, in the spirit of Christ, are ready to die for the saints.<a name=1:5></a> Paul of course sets that forth in a peculiar way, and now leadership is essential to the saints going forward in rank, under authority from the Lord, but wielded by Him in the Spirit's power through vessels that are in His mind and are ready to go forward.<a name=1:6></a> What marks a leader are moral qualities, that is spontaneity and initiative, discerning the way the Lord is going and, as following hard after

		Him, they are able to give a lead to the saints.<a name=2:1></a> The spirit of leadership is to pervade in the assembly, as supported by the mutuality proper to Christ's body amongst the saints.<a name=2:2></a> So that there is nothing official or arbitrary, it is winsome as after Christ, whose leading we all owe everything to, and ever will.<a name=2:3></a> He leads them out, as the Shepherd in a love that is irresistible, because it is His.<a name=2:4></a> So that leadership does suppose a state in the saints, which the disciples in attachment to Christ furnished -- "Lord, to whom shall we go?<a name=2:5></a> thou hast words of life eternal" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#6:68">John  6:68</a>).<a name=2:6></a> That leadership now supposes a state amongst the saints, however few, that is leadable and will go forward with God.<a name=2:7></a> For He cannot be static in such a scene, all is moral death around and life essentially must move, and must move intelligently, normally in manhood.<a name=2:8></a> Movement is not to be like that in christendom -- beating the air.<a name=2:9></a> Movement is to be definite, to a divine goal, defined really in regard to Christ in glory, so that every true leader leads to Christ there.<a name=2:10></a> In another sense, of course, he gives a lead assembly-wise to the saints, ever keeping the divine goal in mind.<a name=2:11></a> The Spirit Himself is said to be a Guide.<a name=2:12></a> So that Christ's leadership is by the Spirit through vessels He raises up.<a name=2:13></a> But the element of lead is largely in

		influence, as well as in authoritative love.<a name=3:1></a> So that each of us, having learnt leadership from Christ, and what it has meant for Him in love to go into death, can understand that this feature which shone in such excellence in Him must be perpetuated here; and regarded and respected as divinely provided.<a name=3:2></a> For the dispensation commenced with leadership in the apostles and developed peculiarly in Paul later, and it is finishing in leadership.<a name=3:3></a> After all the great church revival of the past hundred and fifty years has been marked by gracious leadership, raised up of the Lord, the Lord having stood by the leaders.<a name=3:4></a> All the opposition that the enemy has raised to it has only confirmed the Lord's decision and determination to see the leaders of His own appointment fulfil their course.<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is a little what is in mind.<a name=3:6></a> Moses, of course, ministerially represents the great thought of guidance and authority in leadership in the Old Testament.<a name=3:7></a> He is very much like the Paul of the New Testament.<a name=3:8></a>

		Christ, and the sheep represent that -- those who need defending and protecting.<a name=4:1></a> The way he took them was, I suppose, in spiritual initiative and spontaneity, because it does not appear that Jethro directed him.<a name=4:2></a> He took them the way, and the Spirit comments upon it, behind the wilderness.<a name=4:3></a> Such was Paul at Corinth.<a name=4:4></a> Amidst the false leaders there, was this one who lead them by way of the cross, -- behind the wilderness and came to the mountain of God, so that God's system is established in stability and elevation -- the mountain -- in the presence of all that is hostile.<a name=4:5></a> It is His answer to it, and he proves the superiority of what He has set up, against every combination that would overthrow it.<a name=4:6></a> The position is safe today for faith, set up in Christ in glory and the Holy Spirit here in the assembly, which gives the mountain thought no doubt.<a name=4:7></a> There are moral conditions that leadership is always bound up with, and which false leadership ignores in its haste to reach the throne, but which true leadership patiently accepts in divine discipline, and so is equal to its charge, when promoted by the Lord.<a name=4:8></a>

		P.L.<a name=5:1></a> That is it.<a name=5:2></a> You may say, 'You failed Moses'.<a name=5:3></a> Well, the account given in the New Testament, and it is important, is that he went out you know, he did not fear the king.<a name=5:4></a> That is to say, historically, you may get a certain account of things, that he fled and that he had in the energy, not unknown to us -- human -- tried to deal with the situation that it would be God's prerogative and glory in judgment to deal with.<a name=5:5></a> After all, it is possible that the Egyptians were by their millions, and to kill one of them would be a very slow process you know.<a name=5:6></a> God has, in the death of Christ and the cross, His own means of ending with that man in totality.<a name=5:7></a>

		P.L.<a name=6:6></a> Oh yes.<a name=6:7></a> He sat there, it is characteristic of him.<a name=6:8></a> I suppose what would answer to his sitting by the well later, would be his going into the holiest.<a name=6:9></a> For he had right to go in -- Aaron once a year -- but it would seem that Moses went in whenever his heart yearned to be with God, and to hear what God had to say about Himself, and about His people, and about the assembly.<a name=6:10></a>
