		THE PRICELESS PEARL
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		David Morse, a missionary resident on the west coast of India, was talking with an old pearl-fisher, in whom he had been interested for a long time.<a name=1:1></a> The latter had just surfaced from a dive with a large pearl oyster between his teeth.<a name=1:2></a> The missionary opened it with a pen-knife and drew out of it a magnificent pearl.<a name=1:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'Look, Rambhau.<a name=1:4></a> It's worth a fortune.<a name=1:5></a>'
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The fisherman shrugged his shoulders.<a name=1:6></a> 'Yes, it is beautiful, but.<a name=1:7></a>.<a name=1:8></a>.<a name=1:9></a>'
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'What?<a name=1:10></a> Have you seen more beautiful ones?<a name=1:11></a>'
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'Oh yes!<a name=1:12></a> There are more beautiful ones.<a name=1:13></a> I have one.<a name=1:14></a>.<a name=1:15></a>.<a name=1:16></a>' He stopped, as if words failed him.<a name=1:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'Look, there are blemishes, this spot here, that slight chip there, and it is a little too elongated.<a name=1:18></a> It is beautiful, no doubt, but there are better ones.<a name=1:19></a>' 
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'You are too demanding,' exclaimed Mr Morse.<a name=1:20></a> 'I think it is perfect.<a name=1:21></a>'
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'Well,' said Rambhau, 'It's what you say in your preachings.<a name=1:22></a> People look upon themselves as perfect, but God sees them as they really are.<a name=1:23></a>'
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The conversation continued while the two men walked back towards the town along a dusty road.<a name=1:24></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'What you say is right, Rambhau.<a name=1:25></a> Do you not see that God, who declares all men unfit for His presence, offers complete justification to all those who simply believe His word and accept His free salvation?<a name=1:26></a>'
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'No, I cannot believe it, Sahib.<a name=1:27></a> I have often told you, it would be too easy!<a name=1:28></a> Your religion has many good things about it, but it is mistaken on this point.<a name=1:29></a> I cannot accept it.<a name=1:30></a> Perhaps I am too proud, but I must work for my place in heaven.<a name=1:31></a> You see, I should feel ill at ease there.<a name=1:32></a>'
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'Oh!<a name=1:33></a> Rambhau!<a name=1:34></a>' murmured the missionary.<a name=1:35></a> He had been praying for this man for years, without any result up to now.<a name=1:36></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'Rambhau,' Mr Morse continued gravely, 'Don't expect to get to heaven in this way!<a name=1:37></a> There is only one way and it is not that of works, but Christ alone.<a name=1:38></a> Rambhau, you are old now and perhaps this will be your last pearl-fishing season.<a name=1:39></a> To have the pearly gates of heaven opened for you, you must accept the new life God offers you in His Son Jesus Christ.<a name=1:40></a>'
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'Yes, it is my last season.<a name=1:41></a> I have fished for the last time today.<a name=1:42></a> This is the end of the year and I have preparations to make for the coming one.<a name=1:43></a>'
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'You ought to prepare for the life to come.<a name=1:44></a>'
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'Just so.<a name=1:45></a> Do you see that man over there?<a name=1:46></a> He is a pilgrim walking barefoot on the sharpest stones and stopping every two or three steps to kneel down and kiss the ground.<a name=1:47></a> I want to begin my pilgrimage on the first day of the new year and go to Delhi on my knees.<a name=1:48></a> I have intended to do this all my life.<a name=1:49></a> I wish to be sure of heaven.<a name=1:50></a>'
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'To Delhi!<a name=1:51></a> But that is nine hundred miles, you will wear your knees out and you will get blood poisoning or leprosy, before you get as far as Bombay!<a name=1:52></a>'
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'Never mind, I must go.<a name=1:53></a> I shall suffer but my suffering will be sweet: it will gain heaven for me.<a name=1:54></a>'
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'Rambhau, my friend, don't do that, I beg of you.<a name=1:55></a> Jesus Christ has died to obtain heaven for you.<a name=1:56></a>'
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The old fisherman shook his head.<a name=1:57></a> 'There is no one on earth more dear to me than you, Sahib Morse.<a name=1:58></a> You have been taking an interest in me for many years, you cared for me when I was ill, you have helped me in my need.<a name=1:59></a> But no one, not even you, can turn me aside from my great desire to gain eternal life.<a name=1:60></a> I must go to Delhi .<a name=1:61></a>.<a name=1:62></a>.<a name=1:63></a>'
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Some days later Rambhau knocked at the missionary's door.<a name=1:64></a> 'You must come home with me for a moment.<a name=1:65></a> I have something to show you.<a name=1:66></a>'
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Mr Morse had the presentiment that his prayers were going to be heard.<a name=1:67></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'I shall come with you with pleasure,' he answered.<a name=1:68></a> But his heart failed him when he heard the old fisherman say, as they came near his dwelling, 'I am leaving for Delhi in a week.<a name=1:69></a>'
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He made his friend sit down on the chair, where the latter had so often explained salvation in vain, then left the room and came back with a little casket.<a name=1:70></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'For many years I have been keeping here a thing I want to speak to you about, Sahib.<a name=1:71></a> You did not know, but I had a son.<a name=1:72></a> He was also a pearl-fisher, the best on the Indian coasts.<a name=1:73></a> He was an excellent diver, had the most piercing eyesight, the steadiest arm, the most powerful lungs.<a name=1:74></a> He was my joy and pride.<a name=1:75></a> He dreamed of finding a pearl more beautiful than all those that had ever been found before, and one day he found it.<a name=1:76></a> But, in order to have it, he remained too long under the water.<a name=1:77></a> He died a short time after.<a name=1:78></a>.<a name=1:79></a>.<a name=1:80></a>'
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The old man bowed his head and for a moment his whole body trembled in silence.<a name=1:81></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'I have kept this pearl ever since,' he continued, 'but now I am going away and who knows whether I shall return?<a name=1:82></a> So I wish to give you my pearl, you, my best friend.<a name=1:83></a>.<a name=1:84></a>.<a name=1:85></a>'
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He opened the casket.<a name=1:86></a> From the cotton-wool surrounding it, he slowly drew out a giant pearl of incomparable brilliancy and fabulous worth.<a name=1:87></a> The missionary remained silent with admiration.<a name=1:88></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'What a marvellous thing, Rambhau!<a name=1:89></a>' he said at last.<a name=1:90></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'It is perfect, Sahib.<a name=1:91></a>'
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A new thought seized the missionary.<a name=1:92></a> He quickly raised his eyes.<a name=1:93></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'Rambhau,' he said, 'It is a remarkable pearl.<a name=1:94></a> Let me buy it.<a name=1:95></a> I will offer you ten thousand dollars.<a name=1:96></a>'
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'Oh, Sahib?<a name=1:97></a> What do you mean?<a name=1:98></a>'
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'Fifteen thousand or more, if necessary.<a name=1:99></a> I will work to obtain it.<a name=1:100></a>'
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'Sahib,' said Rambhau, drawing himself up, 'This pearl is beyond price.<a name=1:101></a> No one in all the world is rich enough to pay for its value to me.<a name=1:102></a> I would not give it up for millions of dollars.<a name=1:103></a> I do not wish to sell it to you.<a name=1:104></a> You can have it only as a gift from me, your friend.<a name=1:105></a>'
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'No, Rambhau.<a name=1:106></a> I cannot accept it thus.<a name=1:107></a> However ardently I desire it, I could not accept it in this way.<a name=1:108></a> Perhaps I am too proud, but it would be too easy.<a name=1:109></a> I must pay or work to obtain it.<a name=1:110></a>'
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'You do not understand me, Sahib.<a name=1:111></a> Don't you see?<a name=1:112></a> My only son gave his life to obtain this pearl and I will not sell it at any price.<a name=1:113></a> What gives it its value is my son's life.<a name=1:114></a> I cannot sell it to you but I can and will give it to you.<a name=1:115></a> Accept it as a token of the affection I have towards you.<a name=1:116></a>'
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Much moved, the missionary could not reply for a moment.<a name=1:117></a> Then he grasped the old man's hand.<a name=1:118></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'Rambhau,' he said gently, 'Do you not see?<a name=1:119></a> What I have said to you is exactly what you have said to God, and what you are saying to me is what God keeps on saying to you.<a name=1:120></a>'
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The pearl-fisher gazed long and questioningly at the missionary.<a name=1:121></a> Slowly he began to understand.<a name=1:122></a> The missionary continued: 'God offers you salvation as a free gift.<a name=1:123></a> It is so great and so costly that no one on earth could purchase it.<a name=1:124></a> Hundreds of millions of dollars would not be sufficient.<a name=1:125></a> No one is good enough to merit it.<a name=1:126></a> Your entrance to heaven has cost God the life of His only Son.<a name=1:127></a> You would not be able to gain salvation, even if you spent a million years on it or made hundreds of pilgrimages.<a name=1:128></a> All you can do is to accept it as a token of the love God has for you, a sinner.<a name=1:129></a> Rambhau, you may be sure I will accept your pearl humbly, asking God to make me worthy of your affection.<a name=1:130></a> But will you not humbly accept God's great gift, knowing that it was necessary for His Son to die, so that He could offer it to you?<a name=1:131></a>'
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Great tears now furrowed the old man's cheeks.<a name=1:132></a> The veil was being lifted.<a name=1:133></a> He understood at last.<a name=1:134></a> 'Sahib, I see it now!<a name=1:135></a> For two years I have acknowledged the teaching of Jesus and have believed on Him, but I could not believe that His salvation was free.<a name=1:136></a> I understand it today: there are things which can neither be bought nor worked for: they are without price.<a name=1:137></a> Sahib, I am willing to accept God's salvation!<a name=1:138></a>'

		THE SUFFICIENCY OF CHRIST
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		After a preaching in Chicago, a man came up to the preacher and said to him, before all the audience: 'You can talk like that about how Christ is dear to you and helps you; but if your wife was dead, as my wife is, and you had some babies crying for their mother, who will never come back, you would not say what you are saying.<a name=3:1></a>'

	<div class="paragraph">
		A chemist, who professed himself to be an atheist, looked at the clock in his shop, and decided it was time to close for the night.<a name=4:23></a><a name=4:10></a><a name=4:3></a><a name=4:1></a> He had scarcely done so when there came a timid ring at the bell.<a name=4:24></a><a name=4:11></a><a name=4:4></a><a name=4:2></a> <a href=".<a name=4:25></a><a name=4:12></a><a name=4:5></a>.<a name=4:26></a><a name=4:13></a><a name=4:6></a>\hymns\hymns1972.<a name=4:27></a><a name=4:14></a><a name=4:7></a>htm#:">Hymn </a>What do you want?<a name=4:28></a><a name=4:15></a><a name=4:8></a>' was the not very polite question, as he opened the door and looked down on the little girl who stood there.<a name=4:29></a><a name=4:16></a><a name=4:9></a> <a href=".<a name=4:30></a><a name=4:17></a>.<a name=4:31></a><a name=4:18></a>\hymns\hymns1972.<a name=4:32></a><a name=4:19></a>htm#:">Hymn </a>Please, sir, mother's bad, and will you give her this medicine?<a name=4:33></a><a name=4:20></a>' 'Too late; can't give people medicine at this time of night.<a name=4:34></a><a name=4:21></a> Come in the morning.<a name=4:35></a><a name=4:22></a>' <a href=".<a name=4:36></a>.<a name=4:37></a>\hymns\hymns1972.<a name=4:38></a>htm#:">Hymn </a>Oh, but do, please, sir; she's so sick; I don't know what I'll do; please give me it!<a name=4:39></a>'

		W P MacKay left home to attend college and medical school at the age of seventeen.<a name=7:1></a> His mother was a very godly Christian, and upon his departure she gave him a Bible, writing her name and his, and a verse of Scripture upon the flyleaf But alas the son had no use for his mother's God, or the Bible she had given him.<a name=7:2></a> He did not consult its pages; and soon after, while drunk he pawned it in order to purchase more drink.<a name=7:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In a school in the north of England someone had done a serious wrong, and the headmaster had in vain tried to find out the culprit.<a name=10:1></a> He felt that, for the honour of the school, he must discover the wrong-doer ; and so he assembled all the classes and, having made known to them the gravity of the offence, he asked the boys for their judgment :s to what should be done.<a name=10:2></a> The boys all agreed that the offender deserved punishment.<a name=10:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the headmaster made an appeal to them, beseeching that the one who had done wrong should come forward and bear his punishment, but the appeal was without success.<a name=10:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next morning the boys were gathered together again, and once more they listened to their headmaster as he pleaded that someone should own to the offence, confessing his failure, and be prepared to bear the penalty, but his entreaties found no answer.<a name=10:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		On the third morning when the school once more assembled, the boys listened for the third time to the supplications of their head.<a name=10:6></a> He spoke to them of how the matter affected the name of the school, and of all that it meant to him as head, and again he asked for their decision as to the rightness of meting out punishment for such an offence.<a name=10:7></a> All agreed without faltering that the wrong was too serious to go uncorrected.<a name=10:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the old headmaster called upon his chief assistant and gave him a cane.<a name=10:9></a> The old man stretched out his own hand and waited.<a name=10:10></a> Seeing what was in the mind of his chief the teacher raised the cane above his head and brought it down on' the outstretched hand.<a name=10:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The pain of the stroke caused the master to pull his hand to his side, but with tightened lips he raised it once more.<a name=10:12></a> The cane cut through the air a second time, but again was the trembling hand raised.<a name=10:13></a> The third stroke fell and then, as the arm was uplifted, a big boy, a boy from the top of the school, rushed forward sobbing and begging, as he confessed to being the wrong-doer, to be allowed to bear the rest of the penalty of his misdeeds.<a name=10:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Many years ago, when the city of Nancy in France had been captured in battle, the victorious Charles the Bold ordered that every tenth person in the town should be slain.<a name=11:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The inhabitants -- young and old -- were assembled in a line along the principal street of the city.<a name=11:2></a> Then, at a word from the Conqueror, a herald went forth and began to count.<a name=11:3></a> Each person on whom fell the fatal number ten was to be sent to be executed by the sword.<a name=11:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Near the head of the line the Governor of the city and his only daughter were placed.<a name=11:5></a> He had long resisted the siege, supported by the heroic girl by his side, but it had been in vain.<a name=11:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Watching the movements of the herald and hearing him count aloud, the daughter of the Governor saw by a rapid glance that the dreaded number was about to fall on her father.<a name=11:7></a> Instantly she slipped behind him and placed herself on the other side.<a name=11:8></a> Before the old man was aware of her object, the number which should have been his had fallen upon his daughter.<a name=11:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He stood for a moment stupefied with astonishment and grief, and then called out to the herald : "Justice !<a name=11:10></a> Justice !<a name=11:11></a> "

	<div class="paragraph">
		"What is the matter, old man ?<a name=11:12></a> " demanded the herald, before passing on.<a name=11:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
