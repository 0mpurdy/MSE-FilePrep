		B.W.<a name=1:1></a>B.<a name=1:2></a> The thought in mind in these meetings, dear brethren, is that of youthful maturity.<a name=1:3></a> I have the young ones especially in mind, and I believe the Lord has too, but I am sure there will be much for the older ones as well.<a name=1:4></a> With those of us who are older there may be a measure of maturity, although it is not automatic, but it is very good if those of us who are older can maintain the youthful features -- spiritually, that is, of course.<a name=1:5></a> We do not expect to have the physical vigour and strength of youth, but it is a great encouragement to see older ones who are spiritually vigorous and alert, bringing maturity into the maintenance of the testimony.<a name=1:6></a> I think it has been said, and I think it is right, that God looks for maturity in every one of us.<a name=1:7></a> That is, there is a measure of maturity that is proper to the children, even the little children.<a name=1:8></a> Then, as we grow up, there is a level of maturity that would mark those who are older, in their teenage years and the early twenties.<a name=1:9></a> Then finally I think God looks for full maturity at around the age of thirty.<a name=1:10></a> I trust we may see some of the features that work out in relation to this thought and be encouraged, every one of us, to be marked by the measure of maturity appropriate to the age that we have reached.<a name=1:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In this first reading, I thought we should be engaged with the Lord Jesus Himself personally.<a name=1:12></a> I would like to say first, for the benefit perhaps of the younger ones, that when we think of Christ in the glory and majesty of His Person, there is no

	<div class="paragraph">
		So we began with this verse in Isaiah.<a name=2:8></a> I may say I always feel a thrill when I read this verse, the glory of Christ seen in the Child born, the Son given, and then there are these five titles.<a name=2:9></a> I trust we may find help in opening them up.<a name=2:10></a> We might see, even in His coming in, that these wonderful thoughts in maturity were in the divine mind.<a name=2:11></a> Literally, the remnant in a day to come will see Him thus.<a name=2:12></a> They will recognise Him to be these things.<a name=2:13></a> It has been worked out, of course, in the gospels and it is worked out now too in this dispensation.<a name=2:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.G.<a name=2:15></a> It seems a very helpful and profitable line to pursue.<a name=2:16></a> Do you think that when God in the beginning said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:26">Genesis  1:26</a>), it was really Christ He had in view in this maturity that you are speaking of?<a name=2:17></a>

		B.W.<a name=2:18></a>B.<a name=2:19></a> Yes, Adam, of course, was created as a full-grown man.<a name=2:20></a> He never grew through the stages through which we have grown, but Jesus did.<a name=2:21></a> But, as you say, God had manhood in mind and, I am sure, principally in Christ Himself.<a name=2:22></a> He has manhood in mind for every one of us too.<a name=2:23></a> If the

		Lord directs, we may arrive at that at the end of these meetings, the fulness of manhood in Paul's ministry.<a name=3:1></a> We need to remember those original thoughts of God: "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness".<a name=3:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.G.<a name=3:3></a> I noticed in prayer you referred to the Lord's personal glories, but also His moral glories.<a name=3:4></a> Do you think the line you are on now would suggest the working out of these moral glories as seen in Him?<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		B.W.<a name=3:6></a>B.<a name=3:7></a> Yes, we need to remember there are both, and they are distinct, in a sense.<a name=3:8></a> You do not exactly mix them up -- His personal glories and His moral glories.<a name=3:9></a> Mr.<a name=3:10></a> Bellett says in his beautiful piece on The Moral Glories of the Lord Jesus Christ, that His personal glories were largely veiled when He was here.<a name=3:11></a> His moral glories shone out resplendent.<a name=3:12></a> The four gospels bring them out.<a name=3:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.G.<a name=3:14></a> Yes, that is helpful.<a name=3:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.B.<a name=3:16></a>F.<a name=3:17></a> Is that seen in, "unto us a child is born"?<a name=3:18></a> A child is entirely dependent on another, seen perfectly in Christ.<a name=3:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		B.W.<a name=3:20></a>B.<a name=3:21></a> I wondered if the Child born would link particularly perhaps with Matthew, and maybe Luke as well.<a name=3:22></a> Whereas the Son given is a more developed thought and perhaps would link more with John's gospel.<a name=3:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.B.<a name=3:24></a>F.<a name=3:25></a> Yes.<a name=3:26></a> And Matthew has in mind material for the assembly.<a name=3:27></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		B.W.<a name=3:28></a>B.<a name=3:29></a> Yes, very good.<a name=3:30></a> That would be what is in mind if we are going to arrive at maturity.<a name=3:31></a> You find your place in the assembly, you function there in manhood and womanhood.<a name=3:32></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		T.H.<a name=3:33></a>S.<a name=3:34></a> Why does it immediately speak about His government?<a name=3:35></a> It is remarkable speaking of government as to a child born and a son given.<a name=3:36></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		B.W.<a name=4:1></a>B.<a name=4:2></a> Well, as we have said already, this verse literally opens up His millennial glory when He will take up the reins of government.<a name=4:3></a> The godly remnant will rejoice to see government in His hands, on His shoulder.<a name=4:4></a> But then there was government exercised by Christ here amongst His own, and it is exercised now in the assembly.<a name=4:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		T.H.<a name=4:6></a>S.<a name=4:7></a> Yes.<a name=4:8></a> I wondered if it linked with what you have referred to as His moral glories.<a name=4:9></a> They are not exactly public, but they are seen by those that have eyes to see them, but soon they will be displayed.<a name=4:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		B.W.<a name=4:11></a>B.<a name=4:12></a> Yes, that is helpful.<a name=4:13></a> It distinguishes the government of Christ from every other government that has gone before.<a name=4:14></a> Those in positions of authority -- we respect them, of course -- are not marked by the moral glories that belong to the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=4:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.D.<a name=4:16></a>P.<a name=4:17></a> Do you think that God particularly has in mind for us to take account of this?<a name=4:18></a> He says, "For unto us a child is born".<a name=4:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		B.W.<a name=4:20></a>B.<a name=4:21></a> I think so.<a name=4:22></a> You can see in the gospels, especially in Matthew and Luke, how there were persons that took account of it and welcomed Him.<a name=4:23></a> When you come to these titles, which I hope we will be able to open up somewhat, I think it links very much with what Simeon has to say in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2">Luke  2</a>.<a name=4:24></a> I think he would have said, 'This Child is Wonderful'.<a name=4:25></a> He expressed it perhaps in slightly different words, but the meaning would be the same.<a name=4:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		R.D.<a name=4:27></a>P.<a name=4:28></a> God speaks as to Him later on, and says, "Hear him", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#9:35">Luke  9:35</a>.<a name=4:29></a> God is coming out towards man in this Child, is He not?<a name=4:30></a> He has man in view for blessing.<a name=4:31></a>

		J.G.<a name=5:4></a>F.<a name=5:5></a> Would our appreciation of Christ lay a basis in our souls for the maturity and full growth that you are speaking about?<a name=5:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		B.W.<a name=5:7></a>B.<a name=5:8></a> I think so.<a name=5:9></a> That would be the theme of these meetings.<a name=5:10></a> The more we appreciate the moral glories, the more there will be a reflection of them in each one of us, and the more features of maturity will be developed in us.<a name=5:11></a>
	</div>

		J.G.<a name=5:12></a>F.<a name=5:13></a> Peter says, "To you therefore who believe is the preciousness", <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:7">1 Peter  2:7</a>.<a name=5:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		C.E.<a name=5:19></a>H.<a name=5:20></a> Is it instructive that very mature thoughts were connected with Christ immediately He came into manhood to save His people from their sins?<a name=5:21></a> "<i>He</i> shall be great .<a name=5:22></a>.<a name=5:23></a>.<a name=5:24></a> and of his kingdom there shall not be an end", <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:32">Luke  1:32</a>, 33.<a name=5:25></a> And then the magi: "Where is the king of the Jews that has been born?<a name=5:26></a>" <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#2:2">Matthew  2:2</a>.<a name=5:27></a> These are very mature thoughts that the Spirit of God brought forward immediately the Lord came into manhood.<a name=5:28></a>

		C.E.<a name=6:1></a>H.<a name=6:2></a> There were stages through which the Lord passed which are really educational for us.<a name=6:3></a> As you said, the Model is there, and does that really show us how we may come into manhood?<a name=6:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		B.W.<a name=6:5></a>B.<a name=6:6></a> I think so.<a name=6:7></a> We cannot assume to compass the divine mind in relation to Jesus coming in as a Babe, but I think that would be one of the thoughts that was in God's mind, that the Lord Jesus should represent each of those stages, to demonstrate to us all what He is looking for in each stage, and also, of course, that the Lord Jesus felt and experienced the things that we all go through.<a name=6:8></a> Every one here who is under thirty-three, the Lord Jesus was that age at one point.<a name=6:9></a> What did He do?<a name=6:10></a> Am I doing those kind of things in any measure at all?<a name=6:11></a> You see, the things that Jesus did are not characteristic of the world's young at the present moment, or the old either.<a name=6:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		D.M.<a name=6:13></a>C.<a name=6:14></a> We distinguish with the Lord that "in Him sin is not", <a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:5">1 John  3:5</a>.<a name=6:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		B.W.<a name=6:16></a>B.<a name=6:17></a> I am glad you say that.<a name=6:18></a> We should always remember that, of course.<a name=6:19></a> Though He went through every stage through which we go, at every point in Him sin is not.<a name=6:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		P.A.<a name=6:21></a>G.<a name=6:22></a> You have referred to these titles.<a name=6:23></a> It says it is "his name".<a name=6:24></a> It is not 'his names'.<a name=6:25></a> Why is it just "his name"?<a name=6:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		B.W.<a name=6:27></a>B.<a name=6:28></a> It is a five-fold name.<a name=6:29></a> The fact that it is five normally links with the idea of human weakness.<a name=6:30></a> I wondered whether it might bear the suggestion that although the Lord was pleased to take that condition, even in human weakness here, yet in that very condition He was magnified by this five-fold title which is capable of tremendous expansion.<a name=6:31></a> Perhaps you had some thought?<a name=6:32></a>

		P.A.<a name=7:1></a>G.<a name=7:2></a> Would the five-fold title be the answer to every human weakness?<a name=7:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		B.W.<a name=7:4></a>B.<a name=7:5></a> Yes, I think that puts it very succinctly.<a name=7:6></a> My feeling is that these five titles link in a way with the four gospels.<a name=7:7></a> Having pondered it a little, I think "Wonderful" embraces the whole of the four gospels.<a name=7:8></a> You can read them through and you can see what is wonderful in every detail.<a name=7:9></a> His own came to that, when He stilled the waters, for instance.<a name=7:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		T.H.<a name=7:11></a>S.<a name=7:12></a> Would it be a feature of maturity that all these moral features blend perfectly in Christ?<a name=7:13></a> One name, and yet there is some variety here -- all together, nothing predominant.<a name=7:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		B.W.<a name=7:15></a>B.<a name=7:16></a> Yes, it was said by J.<a name=7:17></a>N.<a name=7:18></a>D.<a name=7:19></a> as to the gospels, that there was not anything predominant in the personality of Christ <a href="#7:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>.<a name=7:20></a> Those moral glories were all blended together like the fine flour mingled with oil.<a name=7:21></a> I think J.<a name=7:22></a>T.<a name=7:23></a> also said that, if anything, perhaps grace predominated.<a name=7:24></a> I think the idea of blending together is helpful, and the gospels blend together to make a four-fold picture of the life of Jesus here.<a name=7:25></a> It is complete as far as we need to have the record.<a name=7:26></a>

		Perhaps we should look at the final scripture, because there is a certain fulness in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#3">Luke  3</a>.<a name=26:7></a> It says, "And Jesus himself was beginning to be about thirty years old; being as was supposed son of Joseph".<a name=26:8></a> So we have it on the authority of Scripture here at this point, that at about the age of thirty years, this remarkable event happens.<a name=26:9></a> I selected the verses in Luke because he only, I think, gives you this additional touch, that Jesus was praying.<a name=26:10></a> He identifies Himself here with the people who had been baptised.<a name=26:11></a> "Jesus having been baptised and praying, that the heaven was opened".<a name=26:12></a> We come now in the case of the Lord Jesus to the full maturity of manhood and a complete readiness to serve, whatever the service may entail.<a name=26:13></a>

		B.W.<a name=67:1></a>B.<a name=67:2></a> We are considering in these meetings the thought of youthful maturity.<a name=67:3></a> We had the Lord Jesus Himself before us in the first reading, and then in the second reading a number of young ones in Scripture who were helped to develop in maturity and service, even though very young.<a name=67:4></a> This morning I wondered if we might look at these four -- Joseph, Joshua, Ruth and Timothy.<a name=67:5></a> They are persons that are at least in their teens, or perhaps early adulthood, and therefore there is greater development with them in these features of maturity.<a name=67:6></a> They are beginning to take their place in relation to the Lord's testimony and to be useful.<a name=67:7></a> I wondered if the Lord would help us to look at this further development.<a name=67:8></a> We have read rather a lot of scriptures, but it is in mind to cover the scope of these four persons, three men and one woman.<a name=67:9></a> Every one of them, I think, was delightful under the eye of God.<a name=67:10></a>

		So first we have Joseph.<a name=67:11></a> As we know, in many ways Joseph is a type of Christ, but I was not thinking of that side so much, but rather that we might regard him as a young man developing, and maturing very quickly in relation to the interests of the Lord.<a name=67:12></a> We read of him in chapter 37 as a young man of seventeen.<a name=67:13></a> That is a great milepost and test in any young believer's history.<a name=67:14></a> It becomes a test -- which way are you going to go at that age?<a name=67:15></a> The world makes a great bid for teenagers, but the Lord has a great interest in those in their teens.<a name=67:16></a> They can

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in a matter of thirteen years, which lie between these two scriptures in Genesis, Joseph was promoted to a great place in administration.<a name=68:8></a> We see an encouraging picture in Joseph of what the Lord can do with one who is committed in this way.<a name=68:9></a> We see him here "doing service" with his brothers, and he brought an evil report of them, or of their evil discourse.<a name=68:10></a> He had discernment and right desires, and the father loved him.<a name=68:11></a>
