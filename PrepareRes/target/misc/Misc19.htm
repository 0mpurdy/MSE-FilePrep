		The path of the church of God is a narrow path, such a one that the mere moral sense will continually mistake it.<a name=3:1></a> But this should be welcome to us, because it tells us that the Lord looks that His saints be exercised in His truth and ways, unlearning the mere right and wrong of human thoughts that they may be filled with the mind of Christ.<a name=3:2></a>

		The case of Elijah judging the captains of the king of Israel, referred to as it is in the course of the gospels, brings these thoughts to mind.<a name=3:3></a> <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#9:52">Luke  9:52</a> - 56.<a name=3:4></a> The Lord had steadily set His face toward Jerusalem under the sense of this, that "he should be received up".<a name=3:5></a> Something of the thought of glory and of the kingdom was stirring in His soul.<a name=3:6></a> I believe the consciousness of His personal dignity and of His high destiny, as we speak among men, was filling Him as He began His journey toward Jerusalem.<a name=3:7></a> "It came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem, and sent

		messengers before his face".<a name=4:1></a> The expression of conscious dignity breaks forth from this and gives character to the moment, and the disciples feel it.<a name=4:2></a> They appear to catch the tone of His mind, and therefore, when the very first village, through which the path of their ascending Lord lay, refused Him entrance they resent it, and would fain, like Elijah in other days, destroy these insulting captains of Israel.<a name=4:3></a>

		This was nature, the natural sense also of right and wrong.<a name=4:4></a> Why then did the Lord rebuke it?<a name=4:5></a> It was not wanting in either righteousness or affection.<a name=4:6></a> The day will come when the enemies of Christ, who would not that He should reign over them, shall be slain before Him.<a name=4:7></a> There was nothing unrighteous in the demand, "Wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?<a name=4:8></a>", if we but think for a moment of the person and rights of Him who was thus wronged and insulted.<a name=4:9></a> Nor was there a wrong affection in this motion of the heart.<a name=4:10></a> Jealousy for their divine Master stirred it; this motion may be honoured, the moral sense may justify it fully; but Christ rebukes it: "Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of", said the Lord to them.<a name=4:11></a>

		But the mind of Christ has its peculiar way, and nothing guides the saint fully but that: analogy will not do, there must be the <i>spiritual mind</i> to try and challenge even analogies.<a name=6:3></a> Certain correspondences were remarkable here: Elijah was but a stage or two from the glory, just going onward to be "received up", when he smote again and again the captains and their fifties.<a name=6:4></a> He was on a hill, full of great anticipations, we may say, and the chariots and horsemen of Israel and his heavenly journey were lying but a little before him in vision.<a name=6:5></a> The soul of their Master appeared to the disciples on this occasion to be much in company with that of Elijah.<a name=6:6></a> But analogies will not do, and the use of them here was confounding everything, taking the Lord Jesus out of His day of grace into the time of His judgments; inviting Him or urging Him to act in the spirit of the times of <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#11">Revelation  11</a>when He was in the hour of <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4">Luke  4</a>.<a name=6:7></a> The witnesses of <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#11">Revelation  11</a>may go to heaven through the destruction of their enemies, fire going

		out of their mouth to consume them that hurt them, as after the pattern of Elijah; but analogies are not the rule.<a name=7:1></a> They must be challenged by that "mind of Christ" which distinguishes things that differ, and which teaches in the light of the word that Jesus goes to heaven through a path which procures the salvation and not the destruction of men; through His renunciation of the world and not His judgment of it.<a name=7:2></a> Elijah avenged himself on the insulting captains and then went to heaven; the witnesses will ascend to heaven, and their enemies shall behold them, <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#11:3">Revelation  11:3</a> - 11: but Jesus takes the form of a servant, and is obedient unto death, and then God highly exalts Him.<a name=7:3></a> And so the saint: so the church.<a name=7:4></a> "Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations.<a name=7:5></a> I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed me".<a name=7:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here was the mistake: here was the not knowing what manner of spirit they were of.<a name=7:7></a> Analogy strongly favoured the motion of their minds.<a name=7:8></a> The moral sense, which judges according to man's thoughts and not in the light of God's mysteries, justified it.<a name=7:9></a> But He who divinely distinguishes things that differ rebuked it: "Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of".<a name=7:10></a> The way of the disciples here would have disturbed everything, counteracting all the purpose of God.<a name=7:11></a>

		Mistakes of this kind are very old mistakes.<a name=11:5></a> David was erring this way when he purposed to build a house for the Lord; but it was an error, though committed with a right desire of the heart.<a name=11:6></a> The time had not come for building the Lord a house because the Lord had not yet built David a house.<a name=11:7></a> The land was still defiled with blood; and till it was cleansed there was no place for the rest and kingdom of the Lord.<a name=11:8></a> David therefore greatly erred, yet not through double-mindedness but through ignorance.<a name=11:9></a> David's error was this -- that the Lord could take His throne in the earth before the earth was purged.<a name=11:10></a> The servants in the parable erred on the other hand in this, that <i>the church</i> was made the instrument of purging the earth or the world.<a name=11:11></a>
