		As long as the solemn question of the soul's eternal salvation is left in dark uncertainty there will be little, if any, freedom of spirit to think of that which interests Christ or concerns His glory, apart from the bare matter of the sinner's peace and safety.<a name=1:3></a> On the other hand, when one who professes to have the knowledge of this great salvation gives evidence in walk and ways of cold indifference to those interests, it manifests either a very shallow work in the soul, or <i>no real work at all</i>.<a name=1:4></a> For be sure of this, that the work of the spirit <i>in</i> a soul is as great a reality as the work of Christ <i>for</i> that soul, and that in whomsoever He (the Spirit) dwells, His activity will always tend to the glory of Christ.<a name=1:5></a> "He shall glorify <i>Me</i>", said the blessed Lord; "for He shall receive of <i>Mine</i>, and shall show it unto you", <a href="../bible/John.htm#16:14">John  16:14</a>.<a name=1:6></a>

		In case this should fall into the hands of a troubled soul, it may well be to add here, for his comfort, that peace does not depend upon <i>our</i> being satisfied with the work of the spirit in us, but upon <i>God's satisfaction</i> in the work of Christ <i>for</i> us, and as this rests eternally the same, the ground of our peace is unchanging too.<a name=2:1></a> "Christ also hath once suffered for the sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God", <a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#3:18">1 Peter  3:18</a>.<a name=2:2></a> But it is for those who have been recently been brought to the knowledge of salvation that this little book is intended, though it is the earnest prayer of the writer that its pages may graciously be used to the exercise and blessing of every reader who loves our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity.<a name=2:3></a>

		How should I like, before we proceed further, to fill your heart -- if it is not already full -- with the warm and heavenly rays which shine forth from that little sentence in <a href="../bible/John.htm#13:1">John  13:1</a> -- "Having loved His own which were in the world, He loved them unto the end"!<a name=2:4></a> "His own"!<a name=2:5></a> What a precious thought!<a name=2:6></a> His, not only by <i>Creator-right</i> and <i>redemption-titles</i>, but His by gift from the Father -- "Thine they were, and Thou gavest them Me", <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:6">John  17:6</a>.<a name=2:7></a> And so precious is this

		thought to His own heart, that seven times over in that remarkable out-breathing of His soul to the Father -- <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>-- He makes mention of it.<a name=3:1></a> Is this not enough to fill your heart, dear reader?<a name=3:2></a> 'Tis true you are left for a little while in this cold, dark world, but you are "<i>loved</i>" by Him, and loved through everything, right on "<i>to the end</i>".<a name=3:3></a> Never dream, I pray you, of asking Him to <i>increase</i> His love toward you.<a name=3:4></a> He never <i>could</i> love you more, and He never <i>will</i> love you less.<a name=3:5></a> Blessed be His name, His love is like Himself -- infinite and eternal.<a name=3:6></a>

		Now I need not say that you are not the only one in this poor world loved by Christ and saved by His precious blood.<a name=3:9></a> There are other joint-heirs, "many sons", that have God's eternal glory as their bright destiny; and I am desirous of saying a few simple words to you about your path in connection with these, your fellow-Christians -- "His

		Mark, I am not going to say a word against right order, but rather to urge its importance.<a name=4:9></a> Yet I do see the necessity of pressing upon you a prior thing.<a name=4:10></a> What would any master care for the most exact order of laying a table if the knives and forks, etc.<a name=4:11></a>, were in a dirty and unsatisfactory state, and the servant himself in a disgraceful untidiness?<a name=4:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now pause here a moment, and let me ask myself and you a practical question: Is there anything in your heart which you are well aware would not have a place there for an instant if your blessed Lord and Master had it <i>all</i> His own way with you?<a name=5:3></a> Let us honestly face that question, and be very jealous lest there be a single selfish reserve in our hearts from Him.<a name=5:4></a> A Christian who cherishes such a reserve is virtually saying, "Lord, I can trust Thee with my safety, but cannot trust Thee with my happiness".<a name=5:5></a> Oh, let us consider Him more, dear reader!<a name=5:6></a> "He sold <i>all that He had</i>", and gave His precious life-blood too, for the joy of making us "His own"; and having done and suffered all this <i>for</i> us, He now gives everything <i>to</i> us, and makes a feast for His own heart in doing it.<a name=5:7></a> What a Giver!<a name=5:8></a> What a Lover!<a name=5:9></a> Blessed, thrice blessed Savior!<a name=5:10></a> Help me praise Him, and let us exalt His name together.<a name=5:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is well at the commencement of your Christian career to be fully alive to the fact that it is the <i>word of God</i>, which must be the touchstone for everything in your path, whether personally or relatively.<a name=7:4></a> Look at <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#119:104">Psalm  119:104</a>, "Through Thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I <i>hate</i> every <i>false way</i>"; and again, verse 128, "Therefore I esteem all Thy precepts concerning all things to be <i>right</i>; and I hate every <i>false way</i>".<a name=7:5></a> Notice how decidely the Holy Spirit speaks through the Psalmist.<a name=7:6></a> It is either a <i>right</i> way because according to the word, or it is a <i>false way</i> to be <i>hated</i>.<a name=7:7></a> Man naturally loves to tone things down to keep his conscience quiet.<a name=7:8></a> God in creation

		YOUR GROUND OF FELLOWSHIP WITH OTHER CHRISTIANS; OR, IN OTHER WORDS, YOUR CHURCH POSITION.
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One of the first things, I believe, which the renewed heart craves for is fellowship with God's people.<a name=8:4></a> He finds himself no longer at home in the world, and naturally seeks 'his own company'.<a name=8:5></a> But amidst all the names and divisions of disordered Christendom, a newborn soul may well inquire, 'Where shall I turn to be right?<a name=8:6></a>' My answer is, "To God, and to the word of His grace", <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20:32">Acts  20:32</a>.<a name=8:7></a> Whoever is wrong, <i>God and His word are right</i>.<a name=8:8></a> Get that well grounded in your soul, and "cease from man, whose breath is in his nostrils".<a name=8:9></a>

		A few years ago two Christians, hitherto strangers to each other, were traveling together in a railway carriage, when, after some conversation about the Lord and His interests, one of them leaned forward and said, '<i>May I ask what denomination you belong to</i>?<a name=9:1></a>' 'Well, that is a common enough question', replied the other, 'but will you first say what you think is to guide me in my path as a Christian?<a name=9:2></a>'
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		He agreed at once that it was the word of God alone that could with certainty direct him.<a name=9:3></a> 'Then, if you will allow me', said his fellow-traveler, 'I will answer <i>your</i> question by proposing another; viz.<a name=9:4></a>, WHAT DENOMINATION DOES THE WORD OF GOD PUT ME INTO?<a name=9:5></a>' After some silent deliberation he said, 'Why, none at all'.<a name=9:6></a> 'Then I can't belong to one at all', replied the other; 'for if I did -- upon your own showing -- I should clearly be in a position where the word of God had not placed me'.<a name=9:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		'But', replied the first speaker, 'does not the word of God exhort us not to forsake the assembling of ourselves together, "and so much the more, as we see the day approaching"?<a name=9:8></a>', <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:25">Hebrews  10:25</a>.<a name=9:9></a>

		'Yes, it does.<a name=10:1></a> But a Christian need not belong to a denomination to obey that word; for the Lord Jesus said, "Where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I in the midst of them"', <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:20">Matthew  18:20</a>.<a name=10:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, dear reader, if you look at <a href="../bible/2John.htm#6">2 John  6</a>, you will find that he exhorts the elect lady, and those with her, thus: "And this is love, that we walk after His commandments.<a name=10:3></a> This is the commandment.<a name=10:4></a> <i>That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it</i>".<a name=10:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now John had seen the Lord in His wondrous life; had seen Him die upon the cross; and was a witness of His resurrection; beheld Him taken up into Heaven; and was present when on the day of Pentecost the Holy Spirit came down from an ascended Christ to baptise believers into one body, and thus form the Church.<a name=10:6></a> He had lived long enough to see evil come into the circle of the professing Church; but what is the remedy?<a name=10:7></a> Is it, 'Begin afresh with a new and purer sect of a more improved constitution'?<a name=10:8></a> Listen to his reply by the Holy Spirit: "<i>This is the commandment, that, as ye have heard from the beginning ye should walk in it</i>".<a name=10:9></a> So that the Spirit of God makes it plain that He suffers no innovation of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now apply this principle today, and you must find yourself in one of two positions -- either on God's ground of gathering the disciples at the beginning, or on some ground that man, in his fancied wisdom or mistaken zeal, has set up since the beginning.<a name=11:2></a>

	<div class="heading">
		THE ONE BODY AND ITS MEMBERS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:42">Acts  2:42</a>, it is said of the early disciples "they continued steadfastly in the <i>apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers</i>".<a name=11:3></a> After the conversion of Saul of Tarsus an entirely new revelation was made to the Church through this once champion persecutor of the saints; namely, that every believer on earth was united to Christ by the Holy Spirit (see <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:4">Acts  9:4</a>; <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#6:17">1 Corinthians  6:17</a>; <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:12">1 Corinthians  12:12</a> - 27); that "as the body is <i>one</i>, and hath many members and all the members of that <i>one body</i>, being many, are <i>one body</i>: so also is (the) Christ.<a name=11:4></a> For by one spirit are we all baptised into <i>one body</i>, whether we be Jews
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=12>[Page 12]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:12">1 Corinthians  12:12</a> - 13.<a name=12:1></a> Then in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:3">Ephesians  4:3</a> - 4, we not only get the same fact plainly stated -- "There is one body", but we are exhorted to <i>endeavor</i> [or, use diligence] "<i>to keep the unity of the Spirit</i> in the bond of peace"; that is, we are to maintain <i>practically</i> what the Holy Spirit has formed <i>spiritually</i>.<a name=12:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two classes of Christians in the world.<a name=12:3></a> One practically says, 'Man has formed many bodies, and I being a member of one of these -- the best according to my opinion -- desire to serve its interests in every possible way I can'.<a name=12:4></a> The other says, 'God has formed one body and made me a member of it, and now I desire by His grace to serve the interests of the Head of that body, according to the principles laid down in His Word who formed it'.<a name=12:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, dear reader, to which of these classes do you belong?<a name=12:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Alas!<a name=12:7></a> How many a precious saint of God is represented by the first!<a name=12:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Do you not often hear a Christian talk about 'joining' this or that body?<a name=12:9></a> Surely such as one forgets -- if he ever knew -- that
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=13>[Page 13]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the only body which God in His word recognizes is the "<i>one body</i>" of which Christ Himself is the Head, and of which every true believer is a living member.<a name=13:1></a> If saved, therefore -- to use a common expression -- you are already a 'joined member'.<a name=13:2></a> "He that is joined unto the Lord is one Spirit", <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#6:17">1 Corinthians  6:17</a>.<a name=13:3></a> And in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:18">1 Corinthians  12:18</a>, using the figure of the human body, the apostle says, "GOD HATH SET <i>the members every one of them in the body</i> AS IT HATH PLEASED HIM".<a name=13:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What sad confusion then to talk of joining some other body.<a name=13:5></a> Why not be content with the place God has given you in the "body of Christ", and seek through grace to fulfil the responsibilities of such a place?<a name=13:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the Holy Spirit certainly never baptised believers into a 'sect' or denomination.<a name=13:7></a> Look at <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:12">1 Corinthians  1:12</a> - 13, and chapter 3:3, and you will see that He meets in the very threshold, so to speak, the incoming of sectarian spirit in Corinth with a most withering stroke of condemnation.<a name=13:8></a> "Are ye not carnal, and walk as men?<a name=13:9></a> For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I of Apollos; are ye not carnal?<a name=13:10></a>"

		<a name=14>[Page 14]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But you may inquire, 'If it is wrong to stand upon or uphold a sectarian position, is there any definite way laid down in God's word of expressing the truth of the one body?<a name=14:1></a>' To answer this we must look at what Scripture says of
	</div>
	<div class="heading">
		THE LORD'S TABLE.
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you turn to <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10:16">1 Corinthians  10:16</a>, you will find that just as <i>twelve loaves</i> on the table of showbread expressed what Israel was; viz.<a name=14:2></a>, <i>twelve tribes</i> -- <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#24:5">Leviticus  24:5</a> - 6 -- so the <i>one loaf</i> of the Lord's supper is the symbol to express the truth of what the Church on earth is: viz.<a name=14:3></a>, <i>one body</i>.<a name=14:4></a> "We being many are <i>one bread</i>" [ or, loaf ] "and <i>one body</i>: for we are all partakers of that bread" [ or, loaf ], verse 17.<a name=14:5></a> So that in partaking of the one loaf, the divinely taught Christian owns his union with all true believers on the face of the whole earth, whatever their ignorance, weakness, or Christ-dishonoring divisions may be.<a name=14:6></a> But while he does this, he can only have <i>fellowship</i> with those who are seeking to walk in obedience to the word, and in separation from manifested evil.<a name=14:7></a> The Holy Spirit of God would certainly never seek to maintain outward unity at the expense of inward

		The fellowship in the Church of England is much broader than Scripture owns, because every moral-living baptised and confirmed parishioner is admitted to the Lord's supper, whether he be converted or not; while, on the other hand, that owned in all the dissenting bodies is much too narrow, because in them only those are recognized as 'members' who hold the views of this or that particular sect or denomination.<a name=15:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If Scripture therefore is to be your guide, you must be on a ground wide enough to include every member of the body of Christ, whose walk and ways are according to holiness and truth, and narrow enough to exclude all that scriptural discipline would shut out.<a name=15:4></a>
