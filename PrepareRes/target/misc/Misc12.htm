		The scriptures we have read each contain a reference to walking, and I want to speak of three aspects of walking that enter into the Christian's pathway here: walking with God; walking with Christ; and walking with one another.<a name=1:2></a> It is a great matter to consider that God would have us to be in keeping with His thoughts, and to seek to walk with Him.<a name=1:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first reference in Scripture to walking is in respect of God Himself.<a name=1:4></a> Think of how He must have felt when He walked "in the garden in the cool of the day" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#3:8">Genesis  3:8</a>) and found that Adam and Eve had hidden themselves from Him.<a name=1:5></a> How that must have affected God, yet He does not give up this great thought.<a name=1:6></a>

		Enoch, -- "the seventh from Adam" (<a href="../bible/Jude.htm#14">Jude  14</a>), was a disciplined person (as his name suggests), and he learned to walk with God.<a name=1:7></a> It says, he "walked with God; and he was not, for God took him"; he was so pleasing to God that God took him.<a name=1:8></a> Let us take account of his history: it says, "And Enoch lived sixty-five years, and begot Methushelah.<a name=1:9></a> And Enoch walked with God after he had begotten Methushelah three hundred years".<a name=1:10></a> It was after Methushelah was born that Enoch is said to have walked with God, and he, no doubt, was a model for Methushelah in the midst of the very difficult conditions that were existent in the then world.<a name=1:11></a> What

		a walk that must have been!<a name=2:1></a> Amos says, "Shall two walk together except they be agreed?<a name=2:2></a>" (<a href="../bible/Amos.htm#3:3">Amos  3:3</a>).<a name=2:3></a> So that is a matter for our attention at this time: if we are going to walk with God, then we must be in agreement with God's thoughts and feelings.<a name=2:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Hebrews it says, "By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him; for before his translation, he has the testimony that he had pleased God" (chapter 11: 5).<a name=2:5></a> He did not have to wait for that testimony -- "he <i>has</i> the testimony" What a thought that is -- and I would commend it to every one present, that we might be exercised to be found here as those that please God.<a name=2:6></a> Christ is the great Model for us, and it says that "the Christ also did not please himself" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#15:3">Romans  15:3</a>).<a name=2:7></a> Think of the pathway of Jesus in devotion to God His Father's will.<a name=2:8></a> Well, if we have not taken up this matter of walking with God, then let us take it up now.<a name=2:9></a> God would help us in relation to this matter of walking: He says in relation to Ephraim, "I it was that taught Ephraim to walk" (<a href="../bible/Hosea.htm#11:3">Hosea  11:3</a>) -- think of God helping us to walk!<a name=2:10></a> At the end of Hosea, Ephraim is brought to see, as healed from his backsliding, that his fruit was from God (chapter 14: 8).<a name=2:11></a> What a triumph -- God had secured His end!<a name=2:12></a> And why should we, too, not walk with God?<a name=2:13></a> God desires it.<a name=2:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I would like to draw attention to what it says in Micah: "He hath shewn thee, O man, what is good: and what doth Jehovah require of thee, but to do justly, and to love goodness, and to walk humbly

		with thy God?<a name=3:1></a>" (chapter 6: 8).<a name=3:2></a> God desires that we might walk humbly with Him through this scene that is marked by ruin and failure on every hand, and yet, as walking with God I think we can be kept in the peace and quiet which marks His presence.<a name=3:3></a> Well, God would help us in these things.<a name=3:4></a> Let that be our outlook, for we are soon going to be translated.<a name=3:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It says in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#6">Genesis  6</a>, "But Noah found favour in the eyes of Jehovah"; he was "a just man"; and in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:7">Hebrews  11:7</a> it says that "Noah .<a name=3:6></a>.<a name=3:7></a>.<a name=3:8></a> prepared an ark for the saving of his house"; he had his household in mind.<a name=3:9></a> God instructed him in relation to the building of the ark, and what was involved there was that things, typically, were to be carried through into another scene altogether.<a name=3:10></a> It is remarkable that Noah "found favour in the eyes of Jehovah" at a time when "the earth was corrupt before God, and .<a name=3:11></a>.<a name=3:12></a>.<a name=3:13></a> full of violence" (verse 11).<a name=3:14></a> We need to set ourselves to be walking here in such a way that we are pleasing to God.<a name=3:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		"Without faith", of course, "it is impossible to please him", that is, to please God (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:6">Hebrews  11:6</a>).<a name=3:16></a> And so it is necessary for us as Christians to understand that our pathway here is a pathway of faith: "we walk by faith, not by sight" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:7">2 Corinthians  5:7</a>).<a name=3:17></a> It says, "Noah was a just man, perfect amongst his generations" -- what a commendation!<a name=3:18></a> The Spirit of God would challenge our hearts as to what characterises us in the present state of things publicly.<a name=3:19></a> Noah lived in a difficult period: "the earth was corrupt", and God was about to bring judgment

		on the whole earth.<a name=4:1></a> But He preserved Noah and those with him in the ark.<a name=4:2></a> The saints are to be preserved at the present time in the assembly, a sphere of salvation, and light from heaven is to govern us in our pathway here.<a name=4:3></a> God is wise in what He does, and as we trust Him, we can see the wisdom of His operations.<a name=4:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Noah walked with God".<a name=4:5></a> Oh!<a name=4:6></a> what a pleasure that must have been to God in the midst of that scene of desolation and ruin.<a name=4:7></a> Peter speaks of Noah as "a preacher of righteousness" (<a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#2:5">2 Peter  2:5</a>), though we do not read of any results from his preaching.<a name=4:8></a> It says, after he came out of the ark, that "Noah built an altar to Jehovah; and took of every clean animal, and of all clean fowl, and offered up burnt-offerings on the altar.<a name=4:9></a> And Jehovah smelled the sweet odour" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#8:20">Genesis  8:20</a>, 21).<a name=4:10></a> Noah was not told to build this altar, but he had right instinct in his heart that a response was due to God who had brought him through into the renewed earth, and so it says, "Jehovah smelled the sweet odour" (footnote <i>b</i>, Lit.<a name=4:11></a> 'odour of rest').<a name=4:12></a> What a matter that is for us to take account of!<a name=4:13></a> May we, therefore, walk with God here and prove the salvation that He can bring in for all who exercise faith in Him in their various circumstances and difficulties,.<a name=4:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God records these things here for our encouragement and it is for us, beloved brethren, to seek, in the present circumstances in which we are, to walk in quietness and communion with God.<a name=4:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, I touch now on Levi in <a href="../bible/Malachi.htm#2">Malachi  2</a>, another

		person who walked with God: "he walked with me in peace and uprightness".<a name=5:1></a> Difficult conditions were extant in Malachi's day.<a name=5:2></a> In the previous chapter Israel were offering "polluted bread upon mine altar" (verse 7), and Jehovah asks, "Who is there among you that would even shut the doors?<a name=5:3></a> and ye would not kindle fire on mine altar for nothing" (chapter 1: 10).<a name=5:4></a> Yet God addresses Himself to His priests, "this commandment is for you".<a name=5:5></a> Well, we are all priests according to God, and God would address His word to us at this time.<a name=5:6></a> It is a "commandment" and it is to regulate us and bring us into the gain of His mind.<a name=5:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So Jehovah says, "And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that my covenant might be with Levi, saith Jehovah of hosts.<a name=5:8></a> My covenant with him was of life and peace, and I gave them to him that he might fear; and he feared me".<a name=5:9></a> How important it is that we should walk here, reverentially fearing God, and trembling at His word.<a name=5:10></a> Oh!<a name=5:11></a> that is what Gods loves: "a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#51:17">Psalm  51:17</a>).<a name=5:12></a> God loves those of a chastened spirit who feel the terrible conditions that exist where men are denying God and not honouring His name.<a name=5:13></a> God would have us to be marked by a humble and contrite heart.<a name=5:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so it says of Levi, "The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips".<a name=5:15></a> That is to govern every one of us; God is taking account of what we say, as He took account of what was characterising Levi at this time.<a name=5:16></a> Oh!<a name=5:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=6>[Page 6]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		what a challenge that is, beloved brethren.<a name=6:1></a> And God would encourage us because He gave His covenant that it might be with Levi on a moral basis: "he walked with me in peace and uprightness", and then Jehovah says, "and he turned many from iniquity".<a name=6:2></a> I think that is the way to move in order to influence one another rightly -- in truth and righteousness.<a name=6:3></a> God takes account of whether we are marked by righteousness or unrighteousness.<a name=6:4></a> Levi exercised a great influence because of the way he walked before God.<a name=6:5></a> "He walked with me in peace and uprightness".<a name=6:6></a> Levi considered for God.<a name=6:7></a> I think that is the way of blessing.<a name=6:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the blessing of Moses in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#33">Deuteronomy  33</a>it says, "And of Levi he said, Thy Thummim and thy Urim are for thy godly one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah; who said to his father and to his mother, I see him not, and he acknowledged not his brethren, and knew not his own children; for they have observed thy word, and kept thy covenant.<a name=6:9></a> They shall teach Jacob thine ordinances, and Israel thy law: they shall put incense before thy nostrils, and whole burnt-offering upon thine altar.<a name=6:10></a> Bless, Jehovah, his substance!<a name=6:11></a> And let the work of his hands please thee" (verses 8 - 11).<a name=6:12></a> Think of how Levi acted in that difficult situation and preserved things for God, and God valued that.<a name=6:13></a> As we come through difficult circumstances, what is to be the result?<a name=6:14></a> I think it is to put incense before God's nostrils, that is, to praise God, to walk in such a way that would

		please Him.<a name=7:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		No doubt there were many others who walked so as to please God.<a name=7:2></a> Abraham was one such, and Jehovah said to him, "walk before my face, and be perfect" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#17:1">Genesis  17:1</a>).<a name=7:3></a> Paul was another, and he could say, "I have walked in all good conscience with God unto this day" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#23:1">Acts  23:1</a>).<a name=7:4></a> So the word comes to one's self at this time, and to every one of us, Are we prepared from now on to walk with God?<a name=7:5></a> That is what God would have us to do, so that we are here in a way that is pleasing to Him.<a name=7:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/John.htm#6">John  6</a>the Lord is speaking in the synagogue.<a name=7:7></a> It is clear that there were some there that were walking with Him.<a name=7:8></a> But the pathway became too difficult for some persons.<a name=7:9></a> When does the pathway become too difficult, beloved brethren?<a name=7:10></a> It is when we lose sight of the Lord Jesus.<a name=7:11></a> When He is not the supreme Object of our hearts, then the pathway becomes difficult; but if we are occupied with Him, then the pathway becomes plain.<a name=7:12></a> I do not say that the pathway is easy -- it is a pathway of faith -- but as we look to Christ in glory, then we will be sustained and blessed here.<a name=7:13></a>

		"Many .<a name=7:14></a>.<a name=7:15></a>.<a name=7:16></a> of his disciples .<a name=7:17></a>.<a name=7:18></a>.<a name=7:19></a> said, This word is hard; who can hear it?<a name=7:20></a>".<a name=7:21></a> Some were not prepared for the pathway here.<a name=7:22></a> The Lord says, "Does this offend you?<a name=7:23></a>" Are we offended by the truth, beloved brethren?<a name=7:24></a> When the Lord brings truth before us, do we shirk the responsibility to answer to it?<a name=7:25></a> Well, if we shirk it, then we may be stumbled.<a name=7:26></a> But, if we are occupied with what the Lord is saying at the time,

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord says, "no one can come to me unless it be given to him from the Father".<a name=8:7></a> What an encouragement that should be to every one who has been chosen by God, who, in sovereign love and mercy, has brought us to have an appreciation of Jesus, His well-beloved Son.<a name=8:8></a> Then it says, "From that time many of his disciples went away back and walked no more with him".<a name=8:9></a> Oh!<a name=8:10></a> what a challenge that is -- it comes as a challenge to my heart at this time.<a name=8:11></a> Am I minded to go away back?<a name=8:12></a> Oh!<a name=8:13></a> let us not be drawers back, beloved brethren, but let us be those who go on: "<i>we</i> are not drawers back to perdition" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:39">Hebrews  10:39</a>).<a name=8:14></a> Those who are prepared to accept the word of Christ will prove what it is to have communion with the Lord Jesus in their pathway here.<a name=8:15></a> So let us walk with the Lord, and let us keep Him before us.<a name=8:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		I read in <a href="../bible/1John.htm#1:7">1 John  1:7</a> about walking with one another -- perhaps one of the most testing things in our christian pathway.<a name=10:6></a> How important it is that "we walk in the light".<a name=10:7></a> "That which makes everything manifest is light" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:13">Ephesians  5:13</a>), so if we walk in the light then we can have fellowship with one another.<a name=10:8></a> "God is light, and in him is no darkness at all" (verse 5).<a name=10:9></a> What a wonderful message this is!<a name=10:10></a> The apostle John's heart was full of this message; he wanted to convey it to the saints that they might be able to walk together in the light, as God is in the light.<a name=10:11></a> Oh!<a name=10:12></a> that we might be concerned to walk in the light, and walk with one another.<a name=10:13></a> That is how God would have us to be.<a name=10:14></a> It says later, "He that says he abides in him ought, even as <i>he</i> walked, himself also so to walk" (chapter 2: 6).<a name=10:15></a> What an example we have in the walk of Jesus.<a name=10:16></a> We should be occupied with that steady, devoted, committed walk of the Lord Jesus that led to Calvary, a steadfast walk.<a name=10:17></a> Think of Him coming down from the mount of transfiguration and going on to Calvary to give His life for us.<a name=10:18></a>

		But as to the kingdom all is a failure.<a name=14:3></a> We turn to Revelation, and find that the church, the candle-sticks, have all failed.<a name=14:4></a> But before looking at it there, I turn to <a href="../bible/John.htm#21">John  21</a>to read two verses: "Peter, seeing him, says to Jesus, Lord, and what of this man?<a name=14:5></a> Jesus says to him, If I will that he abide until I come, what is that to thee?<a name=14:6></a>" (verses 21, 22).<a name=14:7></a> Now, in connection with this, John gets, in the book of Revelation, this coming of the Lord, that which closes the history, and therefore I turn to it, and read in the first chapter -- "I saw seven golden lamps, and in the midst of the seven lamps one like the Son of man, clothed with a garment reaching to the feet, and girt about at the breasts with a golden girdle: his head and hair white like white wool, as snow; and his eyes as a flame of fire; and his feet like fine brass, as burning in a furnace; and his voice as the voice of many waters; and having in his right hand seven stars; and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword going forth; and his countenance as the sun shines in its power.<a name=14:8></a> And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead" (verses 12 - 17).<a name=14:9></a> Mark how changed everything is.<a name=14:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Just look at <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>for a moment; for if you do not see how things were at first, you will not see how changed they are now.<a name=14:11></a> At verse 19 you read: "When therefore it was evening on that day, which was the first day of the week, and the doors shut where the disciples were, through fear of the Jews,

	<div class="paragraph">
		The first church brought before us is the church of Ephesus; the one of all others which had been before us as that to which the full favour of God was shown.<a name=16:5></a> And now it has given up the very thing that God first looks for; it has lost its first love.<a name=16:6></a> We cannot stay now to look at each of the churches; but when it comes to the very worst state of things (I suppose all here know that Thyatira brings before us Roman Catholicism), when the church had got to the lowest depths of darkness, then it is you get the precious promise of the morning star: "I will give him the morning star" (chapter 2: 28).<a name=16:7></a> The night is wearing on its dreary length; its long dark hours are passing slowly by.<a name=16:8></a> You know how in travelling by coach, as the tedious hours drag on, how eagerly the weary traveller looks out for the morning star, the promise of the coming day.<a name=16:9></a> And that is just what the Lord gives us here when all is at the darkest; He gives us the morning star, His own coming.<a name=16:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Of course this is not all, but I just pass on to mark how the Lord completes His dealings with the church.<a name=16:11></a> Though He finds no love of theirs to speak of, yet His own has never failed; at the very last it is, "<i>I</i> rebuke and discipline as many as I <i>love</i>" (chapter 3: 19).<a name=16:12></a> And what does He say to them?<a name=16:13></a> "Behold, I stand at the door and am knocking; if any one hear my voice and open the door, I will come in unto him and sup with him, and he with me" (verse 20).<a name=16:14></a> He says,

		All this, I think, plainly shows you that, looked at as an ecclesiastical testimony, the church is a failure.<a name=17:2></a> And when I turn to the last chapter of the book, I say, Is there then nothing for the Lord in the whole earth?<a name=17:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, here I find something new.<a name=17:4></a> The testimony was that of the wise virgins going forth to meet the Bridegroom; but now I find a little word of great importance -- "the <i>bride</i>".<a name=17:5></a> In the midst of all this ruin, then, there will be a bride.<a name=17:6></a> When the Lord comes, He will find a bride here.<a name=17:7></a> That "bright and morning star" will so gain the affections of the saints, that they, in company with the Holy Spirit, will invite Him to come.<a name=17:8></a> The cry has gone forth, "Behold, the bridegroom".<a name=17:9></a> The Lord says, "Yea, I come quickly"; and the saints, awakened up by the approach of Himself, answer, Come, Lord Jesus.<a name=17:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will explain now what the bride is in character, and also show what is the effect upon the saint of being in that position.<a name=17:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The importance of the bride's hope is that, practically, affection is awakened in my heart which invites Him to come, and this makes me fit for Him to come.<a name=17:12></a> His coming is the only thing that answers to the affections of my heart.<a name=17:13></a> Now what would prepare a heart -- what would make a heart fit to say these words, Come, Lord Jesus?<a name=17:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I turn again to <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>because there that which characterises the bride begins.<a name=17:15></a> Mary in heart is

		representative of the bride.<a name=18:1></a> Now there are four different things that characterise the bride.<a name=18:2></a> First, the heart must be won; second, it must be satisfied; third, it must be made suitable; and lastly, comes service.<a name=18:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But first, you must be <i>won</i>.<a name=18:4></a> Mary's heart here is wholly won; I need not show that to you, for it is evident.<a name=18:5></a> She is inconsolable without Him.<a name=18:6></a> She, like the bride of Canticles, seeks Him whom her soul loves.<a name=18:7></a> That is the effect in the saint of the heart being won and not satisfied.<a name=18:8></a> A heart won and not satisfied is a miserable heart; it does not possess the object of its affections.<a name=18:9></a> And many are in that state; the affections His, but no sense of being united to Him; they are bright one day and cast down another, just like the bride in Canticles.<a name=18:10></a> There is no sense of union, for affection is not union.<a name=18:11></a> You may love the Lord in the deepest, fullest way, and yet it may only make you miserable because you are not with Him, because you do not know union.<a name=18:12></a> The very fact of my heart being won makes it dissatisfied; I am in-consolable without the One I love; nothing but His company satisfies me.<a name=18:13></a> A heart fully won knows the Lord in a two-fold way: as a relief, like the widow of Sarepta when her son is dead (<a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#17">1 Kings  17</a>); and as a resource, like Jonah when the gourd is gone (<a href="../bible/Jonah.htm#4">Jonah  4</a>) -- when all that was a shelter and a delight is gone -- there is but one to turn to, and that is the Lord.<a name=18:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next thing to having the heart won is to have it satisfied; and that is what Mary also is in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>.<a name=18:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And as I know Him up there, I find that the One who has gone down into judgment for me, that same blessed One who is now set down on the Father's throne is the One who bears me company on my path down here; He has won my heart, and the affection increases as we go along.<a name=19:5></a> He is there as the Priest to sustain me, and the Advocate to restore me.<a name=19:6></a> I have an Advocate when I sin; and because of this I confess; and God is faithful and just to forgive me my sins, and to cleanse me from all unrighteousness (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:1">1 John  2:1</a>; <a href="../bible/1John.htm#1:9">1 John  1:9</a>).<a name=19:7></a> The man who sins and does not confess loses the sense of divine favour.<a name=19:8></a> The one who confesses goes in and condemns himself, and God says, I come and forgive you all un-righteousness; and thus the heart is kept up fresh in the knowledge of His love.<a name=19:9></a> He will sustain me in all that bright scene.<a name=19:10></a> The Spirit carries me into it all -- into the holiest -- and He is the One who sustains me when I am in.<a name=19:11></a>

		In view of the fact that divine things are made to depend for their continuance on the priesthood, what it involves is of immense importance.<a name=20:6></a> If the priestly state is absent, we really have nothing subjective according to God.<a name=20:7></a> It implies a state formed after Christ, viewed as Man on our side, One capable of sympathy, and One who loves God's people.<a name=20:8></a> One great feature of the high priest's dress was the breastplate (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#28">Exodus  28</a>).<a name=20:9></a> In the breastplate each of the tribes was inscribed, and on each of the shoulder-pieces there were the names of six of the tribes; that is to say, he had the names of the saints on his heart and supported them on his shoulders, so that what answers to priesthood now is love to the saints, and what goes with it, support of the saints.<a name=20:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Christian learns these things from the Lord, and I have no doubt that the consideration of Luke's gospel enables us to perceive the idea.<a name=20:11></a> The Lord is translated to heaven, according to Luke's account, as a Priest.<a name=20:12></a> It is, as it were, heaven approving that kind of a man.<a name=20:13></a> It does not say by <i>what</i> power He was translated, but it says "he .<a name=20:14></a>.<a name=20:15></a>.<a name=20:16></a> was carried up into heaven" (chapter 24: 51).<a name=20:17></a> The character and nature of priesthood is presented in Christ -- in a Man who

		<a name=21>[Page 21]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		loves the saints, and His shoulders are equal to His heart.<a name=21:1></a> So that a man who answers to priesthood now is a man who loves the saints and uses all the power he has to support them.<a name=21:2></a> This comes out in many ways in detail.<a name=21:3></a> To begin with, you impress upon the saints that you are sympathetic with them, and if that is so, you can enter into their exercises; and then all the power you have is subservient to your heart; you support the saints according to your measure.<a name=21:4></a> The High Priest sympathises with us in our infirmities, for He has been <i>with men</i> here.<a name=21:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Luke presents that: he introduces us to a priestly atmosphere at once in order to prepare us for the coming One, the Priest.<a name=21:6></a> He gives us Zacharias and Elizabeth, both of the priestly family (chapter 1: 5), and both are equal to it in their measure, all to prepare us for the Priest; and then the narrative introduces Christ, entering as a Babe and growing up among men, so that He might be with men.<a name=21:7></a> He knows the exercises of men, and His support is for them.<a name=21:8></a> That is the kind of Man that is received up into heaven.<a name=21:9></a> It is not, as in John, that He ascends to the Father (chapter 20: 17), or in Mark, that He sits at the right hand of God (chapter 16: 19).<a name=21:10></a> But in Luke He is carried up into heaven, signifying that that is the kind of man who is to be in heaven, the man that God approves of for that place.<a name=21:11></a> He is suited to the place.<a name=21:12></a> Love is the great feature there.<a name=21:13></a> Now the Lord went into heaven in that sense, and the most prominent feature was the breastplate; that met God's eye, and He delighted in it.<a name=21:14></a> Now, if the Priest

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord is qualified to have sympathy with us in every <i>right</i> exercise.<a name=22:3></a> You take the Psalms: they present exercises which are not distinctly Christian, but they correspond in great measure with the exercises that a soul goes through before knowing deliverance.<a name=22:4></a> The Lord is able to enter into them with you.<a name=22:5></a> He has gone through that, not in His own exercises, but on account of the position that He took up in connection with Israel.<a name=22:6></a> He is capable of sympathy with you in the exercise as He shall be in the future; for He shall enter into the exercises of the godly remnant on earth, and we get the good of that beforehand.<a name=22:7></a> Now He is a Priest in heaven.<a name=22:8></a> He is a Priest to a heavenly people, and He enters into all our exercises here in connection with the heavenly system.<a name=22:9></a> Thus we become attached to Him: succour is a great force to attach your heart to another.<a name=22:10></a> Luke really introduces us to the Priest; he throws, so to speak, a priestly atmosphere around you to prepare you for that.<a name=22:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We show that we are priests practically by the way we take account of the saints.<a name=22:12></a> I do not say that is all, because a great deal more attaches to the priest; primarily he is to minister to God in the priest's office; but directly you have the dress described it is very noticeable that the two shoulder-

	<div class="paragraph">
		But first of all, I would speak of the way God has operated from the very outset on this line: "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:26">Genesis  1:26</a>).<a name=33:6></a> God had not made Himself known then as Father, Son and Spirit, but it is a striking expression, "Let us" -- a movement together in relation to the creation of man.<a name=33:7></a> The Lord says in <a href="../bible/John.htm#5">John  5</a>, "My Father worketh hitherto and I work": the Father and the Son working together.<a name=33:8></a> The Father working hitherto, I believe, refers to the work subsequent to the creation, from the making of those coats of skin to counteract the effects of sin having come into the creation.<a name=33:9></a> Those coats of skin were made to cover Adam and Eve, and a sacrifice was needed to provide them.<a name=33:10></a>

		Satan endeavours to bring in separation among brethren, but God's operations by the Spirit are to bring in unity so that they move together.<a name=33:11></a> The Lord says, "My Father worketh hitherto and I work".<a name=33:12></a> That would involve the Lord going to that cross at Calvary, until He finished the work that was given Him to do.<a name=33:13></a> He laid down His life according to the

		So the Lord says, "The Son can do nothing of himself save whatever he sees the Father doing: for whatever things <i>he</i> does, these things also the Son does in like manner".<a name=34:3></a> You marvel at the glory and greatness of that blessed Person coming into manhood and moving here under the Father's direction.<a name=34:4></a> He says, "The Son can do nothing of himself"; He moved in perfect dependence here, and "he learned obedience from the things which he suffered" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#5:8">Hebrews  5:8</a>) -- He came into the condition of manhood to which obedience applied.<a name=34:5></a> In accord with the glory of His Person, everything was commanded by Himself, but in manhood He set out, in absolute perfection, wondrous obedience to Him who sent Him.<a name=34:6></a> What glory was seen in Christ!<a name=34:7></a> If we see the Father and the Son moving together, surely it is to have an effect upon us practically, so that we do not allow anything to come in to hinder our movement together.<a name=34:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		John speaks a great deal about the work of God in persons, and it is written for us.<a name=35:8></a> As a servant of the Lord said, 'In insisting on Paul, do not forget John', for John's writings are of the greatest importance to strengthen the work of God in us in this day of the greatest departure from Christ and the truth.<a name=35:9></a> John does not write of the failure of the church here, as he does in Revelation, which was written earlier than John's gospel, the last of his writings.<a name=35:10></a> What he brings forward in his gospel are the movements of divine Persons together, which will never fail, and in which we can have absolute confidence.<a name=35:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So, as we keep in that state of soul continually, I believe we shall be helped, not only to get through day-by-day, but to be preserved in spiritual life and vitality -- for what John has in view is the enjoyment of eternal life.<a name=36:6></a> Where do we enjoy eternal life?<a name=36:7></a> We can enjoy it today among saints, such as are here today from different parts of the world, who love the Lord Jesus, who love one another, and who delight to move together in relation to His interests.<a name=36:8></a> Oh!<a name=36:9></a> that we might be preserved on this line, dear brethren.<a name=36:10></a> It is the answer to the wondrous way in which divine Persons have moved together in order that there might be an answer here on earth to Their activities.<a name=36:11></a>

		Now there is to be an answer to this in the saints, and it comes out in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>"And when the day of Pentecost was now accomplishing, they were all together in one place" (verse 1).<a name=38:9></a> The effect of the coming of the Spirit was to set the saints together in one place.<a name=38:10></a> There are many references to "together" at the beginning of the Acts, and what God had at the beginning of this dispensation He is going to have at the end -- it may be in a few, but He is going to have the same character and quality of things, spiritually, I believe, as He had at the beginning.<a name=38:11></a> So there they were, all together in one place, and it says, "there appeared to them parted tongues, as of fire,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We do need to value what the Holy Spirit is ever seeking to do, that is, to magnify the glory of Christ and to fill our poor hearts with the love of Christ, and with the love of God.<a name=39:4></a> This is what will keep saints together.<a name=39:5></a> Why are we together?<a name=39:6></a> Because we love the Lord Jesus.<a name=39:7></a> We are here at this time because we love Him.<a name=39:8></a> We have not seen Him, but we love Him.<a name=39:9></a> And we are waiting for that moment when we will actually see Him.<a name=39:10></a> What a day that will be, when we shall enjoy the love of Christ in all its preciousness and blessedness, eternally.<a name=39:11></a> Oh!<a name=39:12></a> it is a wonderful thing to know such a glorious Person.<a name=39:13></a> "To you therefore who believe", Peter could say, "is the preciousness" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:7">1 Peter  2:7</a>).<a name=39:14></a> May He increasingly become more precious to every one of us.<a name=39:15></a>

		So we see in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>the saints moving together under the influence of the blessed Spirit, and I believe that influence continues right down to this present moment, to keep the saints together in real affection for Christ, and for one another, having the desire to move together, not independently.<a name=39:16></a> One thing that will hinder moving together is independent thinking.<a name=39:17></a> We do need to know the mind of God if we are going to work together.<a name=39:18></a> We must all work to one end with one object in view; whatever work

		In <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2">Ephesians  2</a>Paul is writing to a remarkable company to whom he had disclosed the great purposes of divine love, and the greatness of God's thoughts.<a name=40:7></a> God has in mind having man in the relationship of sonship to praise and adore Him forever, and He has in mind a wondrous vessel, the assembly, in which there will be glory to Him, and praise led by the Lord Jesus.<a name=40:8></a> It is a wonderful end that God has in view in the great work He is doing, and, in His grace, He has taken up you and me to have part in it.<a name=40:9></a> Paul writes to the Ephesian saints, "So then ye are no longer strangers and foreigners, but ye are fellow-citizens of the saints, and of the household of God, being built upon the foundation of the apostles, Jesus Christ himself being the corner-stone, in whom all the building fitted together .<a name=40:10></a>.<a name=40:11></a>.<a name=40:12></a>" I have been struck with those words, "fitted together".<a name=40:13></a> We did not chose one another to be in the localities where we live.<a name=40:14></a> God has set the members in the body as it has pleased Him.<a name=40:15></a> He set each of us just where we are according to His wonderful sovereignty and wisdom in view of completing His

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So Paul says in regard to these Jewish and Gentile believers at Ephesus, "in whom all the building fitted together increases to a holy temple in the Lord".<a name=41:2></a> What is the temple?<a name=41:3></a> It is where divine light is to be found; where the mind of man is to be shut out and the mind of God brought in.<a name=41:4></a> The temple is where we get divine light, and that is why we enquire as we do in our readings of the Scriptures.<a name=41:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think we need to be on the lookout for interested persons who are seeking divine guidance.<a name=41:6></a> A company of believers together, each on individual lines, going their own way and doing their own thing, will not impress anyone who is seeking light.<a name=41:7></a> They remember the words of the Lord Jesus: "A new commandment I give to you, that ye love one another .<a name=41:8></a>.<a name=41:9></a>.<a name=41:10></a> By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have love amongst yourselves" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#13:34">John  13:34</a>, 35).<a name=41:11></a> We do need to be maintained in love for one another, not sentimental love, but love based upon the truth, the fruit of God's work in our souls by the Spirit.<a name=41:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So these Ephesian saints were being "built together".<a name=41:13></a> Gradually and slowly, the building was going on and being "fitted together".<a name=41:14></a> It says that Solomon "commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, hewn stones, to lay the foundation of the house" of Jehovah (<a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#5:17">1 Kings  5:17</a>), and the stone was "entirely made ready before it was brought thither" (chapter 6: 7).<a name=41:15></a> One has said that the believer is like a stone taken out of the quarry of this

		When you go to be with the Lord, either through death or when the Lord comes for us, what will you take with you?<a name=42:5></a> Only the work of God -- your appreciation of the Lord Jesus, your knowledge of His love and the love of God, that is what will remain with you.<a name=42:6></a> God is going to have a universe in which everything will speak to Him of Christ.<a name=42:7></a> And the preparation is taking place at the present time, for Christ is being formed in the hearts of the saints, so that "all the building fitted together increases to a holy temple in the Lord; in whom <i>ye</i> also are built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit".<a name=42:8></a> What a wonderful climax: a dwelling place for God in the Spirit.<a name=42:9></a> "God is a spirit" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#4:24">John  4:24</a>), and let us ever remember that.<a name=42:10></a> Christianity is a spiritual order and system of things, and believers are taken up to form a habitation of God in the Spirit.<a name=42:11></a> I think it is a remarkable fruit of our being fitted together.<a name=42:12></a>

		On previous occasions I have endeavoured to give the scope and bearing of a particular portion of John's gospel, namely, from chapter 7 to chapter 12; and while all Scripture in a sense is practical, yet to open up the scope of Scripture is a different thing from giving a word applicable to the particular circumstances and difficulties in which we find ourselves; and this latter is more my object at this time.<a name=43:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The point to which we came last week in connection with chapter 12 of the gospel of John was that, after witness had been given to the glory of the Lord, He, as lifted up from the earth, becomes a point of gathering.<a name=43:3></a> In chapter 7 the truth had come out that Christ was going away; and in connection with it, on the last day of the feast, the Lord refers to what may be called another day, namely, the Spirit's day.<a name=43:4></a> I see distinctly two things in connection with the presence of Christ here; one is that He Himself was about to be glorified; and the other that the effect of His presence and work here was to leave behind Him a vessel for the Spirit.<a name=43:5></a> You may say the vessel was a small one, and I quite admit it; but still He left a vessel, and the Spirit could not dwell here without a vessel.<a name=43:6></a> In chapters 8 and 9 we find the true character in which Christ was here, namely, "the light of the world"; and by the very fact of His being the light of the world, everything here had been
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	<div class="paragraph">
		brought to an issue.<a name=44:1></a> Those who saw, that is, those who took the ground of competency, were made blind; and on the other hand those who did not see, saw, for there was a work of grace down here to open their eyes.<a name=44:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When we come to chapter 10 (it is all one line of truth), we find the new position in which Christ is as having left the fold, namely, that of the good Shepherd, and the sheep have followed Him out of the fold.<a name=44:3></a> There is now "one flock, one shepherd", but neither flock nor shepherd recognised of the world.<a name=44:4></a> An unseen Shepherd and in a sense an unseen flock, but all bound together in the divine nature.<a name=44:5></a> That is the idea to me of the one flock, and the one Shepherd; not a public thing at all, but it is this, "I know those that are mine, and am known of those that are mine, as the Father knows me and I know the Father" (chapter 10: 14, 15).<a name=44:6></a> But there is still a further point in chapters 11 and 12, that witness is borne to the glory of Christ as Son of God, King of Israel, and Son of man; but for the moment all closes in death, the world is judged, and Christ, as lifted up from the earth, becomes a point of gathering for all; that is, you have got two essential truths in regard to Christ, what He is to the flock, and what He is as a point of gathering.<a name=44:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I spoke of the import of the various titles of Christ last week: that as Son of God, as witnessed in the resurrection of Lazarus, He sets aside death, and raises man up in life; that as King of Israel and Son of David He brings in the sure mercies of David; and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that as Son of man He has universal dominion in the world to come on the ground of redemption.<a name=45:1></a> These are the three ideas which are carried into and embodied in the thought of Christ as Lord; as Lord He administers the grace of God, all that God is towards man is presented to man in power in the Lord.<a name=45:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I desire now to present three points, practical in their character, as being given to us in an epistle.<a name=45:3></a> An epistle is not quite like a gospel, it has a different character; an epistle is written to help Christians, and is presented to their responsibility; but a gospel is written to present Christ to us.<a name=45:4></a> I have observed in regard to the first epistle of John that the platform is not nearly so large as that of the gospel.<a name=45:5></a> In the epistle we find "which thing is true in him and in you" (chapter 2: 8) -- that is, in Christ and Christians; but in the gospel, what is true in the Son and the Father, and the gift of the Spirit.<a name=45:6></a> I think any one must see that there is a very great deal of difference between these two thoughts.<a name=45:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is possible that you may not see at a glance what my purpose is in the three scriptures I have read; and I will tell you what has led me to these passages.<a name=45:8></a> They contained the three main elements of Christianity, namely, fellowship, privilege, and testimony.<a name=45:9></a> Fellowship is the first lesson we all have to learn; the second is privilege, which leads to the truth of the assembly; and the third is testimony, so to say, God presented in us.<a name=45:10></a> And until souls understand something of privilege, you may be sure
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=46>[Page 46]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		there is not much of testimony in them according to God.<a name=46:1></a> For I do not regard testimony simply as preaching, but as that which it was in the thought of God that the christian company, that is, the church, should present collectively to the world.<a name=46:2></a> <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:20">John  17:20</a>, 21, will substantiate that: "I do not demand for these only, but also for those who believe on me through their word; that they may be all one, as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us, that the world may believe that thou hast sent me".<a name=46:3></a> I understand by the passage that the unity of the saints and its character was the testimony presented to the world, though the world did not understand at all what was the secret of that unity; but it was the witness to the world that the Father sent the Son.<a name=46:4></a> It is most important to see that there was in the divine thought the idea of collective testimony.<a name=46:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I take up these three points, fellowship, privilege, and testimony, as opened out in the first epistle of John, and I dare say it may be thought that I might treat them more readily from Paul; but I will tell you why I refer to John for them.<a name=46:6></a> John does not fill the place of Paul.<a name=46:7></a> Paul was the architect, and gives us the structure of the church and the character of the structure.<a name=46:8></a> But the structure which Paul was used of God to rear is in ruins, and it is well for us to recognise it; for if we lose sight of the ruin of the church and do not accept the remnant character, we are not of much account in the eye of God.<a name=46:9></a> The church is in ruins; and I am sure we ought to be
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=47>[Page 47]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		more under the burden of this than we are.<a name=47:1></a> I have felt how little sense I have of the defection of the church, of how far the church is from the mind of God in regard to it.<a name=47:2></a> I think this ought to press upon us more heavily than it does.<a name=47:3></a> The fact is we have had far too much in our thoughts the idea of setting up an expression of the original, and have been pretty much contented with it.<a name=47:4></a> That means that we are losing sight of the ruin of the church.<a name=47:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But we have to remember that the church is here at the present moment both vitally and responsibly.<a name=47:6></a> The body and the house are the two aspects of the church presented in Scripture, and I say without any hesitation that the body of Christ is here upon earth, just as truly as the Spirit of God is here; and, on the other side, that the house is here in its responsibility as such, for Scripture makes it perfectly clear that Christendom has the responsibility of the house of God.<a name=47:7></a> Hence it seems to me that it is entirely out of place for us to entertain the idea of setting up here upon earth a kind of imitation of the church; it means to my mind losing sight of the ruin of the church; and if we are not affected by the ruin of the church, I am sure that we are not in the mind of the Spirit.<a name=47:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The importance of the writings of John is, that though he does not give you the structure of the church, he gives you everything which is essential; for John always goes to what is essential and enduring, both in his gospel and in his epistles.<a name=47:9></a> Though the building may be in ruin and decay, John
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=48>[Page 48]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		gives us what decay cannot touch, and therefore you can understand the great importance to us of John's writings.<a name=48:1></a> John does not give you the church, as such; .<a name=48:2></a>.<a name=48:3></a>.<a name=48:4></a> but he gives you what is essential to the church, that which lies underneath the ruin, and which the ruin cannot affect.<a name=48:5></a> When I come to the first epistle I find these things which may in measure subsist even in the midst of the ruin of the church -- fellowship, privilege, and testimony; and it is on those three points I purpose now to enlarge.<a name=48:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First as to fellowship.<a name=48:7></a> In chapter 1 we read: "If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not practice the truth.<a name=48:8></a> But if we walk in the light as <i>he</i> is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from all sin".<a name=48:9></a> I might call your attention to two parallel passages in Paul: <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:9">1 Corinthians  1:9</a>, "God is faithful, by whom ye have been called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord": and <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10:16">1 Corinthians  10:16</a>, 17, "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion" -- is the same word, "fellowship" -- "of the blood of the Christ?<a name=48:10></a> The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?<a name=48:11></a> Because we, being many, are one loaf, one body; for we all partake of that one loaf".<a name=48:12></a> There is no real divergence of thought in these three passages.<a name=48:13></a> Being in the light of the Lord, you are in the light as God is in the light.<a name=48:14></a> If I were to be asked, How is it that God is in the light?<a name=48:15></a> I should say that it is in the Lord that God is in the light; that is, that there is the most
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=49>[Page 49]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		complete revelation of God in His thought toward man in the Lord.<a name=49:1></a> No one can know what the thought and attitude of God is towards man, except in the Lord Jesus Christ; for it is in Him that it has pleased God to display Himself, and all the thought of God towards man is made good mediatorially in the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=49:2></a> Therefore in the light of the Lord, I am in the light as God is in the light.<a name=49:3></a> We have the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.<a name=49:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now it is the name of the Lord which is our bond of fellowship.<a name=49:5></a> And this is perfectly consistent with <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10">1 Corinthians  10</a>, for being in the fellowship of the Lord, of necessity you are in the fellowship of His death; the two things are bound to go together, for you could not be in the fellowship of the Lord and be going on in things to which He has died -- He has become a gathering point on the ground of having been lifted up from the earth; and concurrent with that is, "Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the prince of this world be cast out" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#12:31">John  12:31</a>).<a name=49:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a very great thing for our souls to be in the light of the glory of the Lord; I do not think they are enough there.<a name=49:7></a> We should be a different kind of people if we apprehended all that is covered by His blessed name, Son of God, Son of David, Son of man.<a name=49:8></a> If our souls were in the light of it we would not care to be in the current of this world, since the soul would be in the light of another world, what Scripture speaks of as "the habitable world which is

	<div class="paragraph">
		to come" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:5">Hebrews  2:5</a>).<a name=50:1></a> The apostle says to the Ephesians, "ye were once darkness, but now light in the Lord" (chapter 5: 8); it is in the Lord you are light, and that is where a soul first gets light -- in the knowledge of the glory of the Lord.<a name=50:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I do not think we distinguish sufficiently between fellowship and privilege.<a name=50:3></a> Fellowship must always be on simple ground.<a name=50:4></a> I do not know whether the term "fellowship" is quite understood.<a name=50:5></a> What I understand by fellowship is a bond of association which in its very nature separates those in it from the course and current of things around them.<a name=50:6></a> There will not be, I judge, any such bond in the millennium, because the outward state of things will be according to God; there will not be any need for fellowship.<a name=50:7></a> But here, in the midst of a world which has rejected Christ and is under judgment, fellowship is essential; there must be a bond of association between Christians which binds them together in one common interest.<a name=50:8></a> Now that is distinct from the idea of privilege, and depends really upon the name of the Lord, which is always our bond of fellowship: "I, if I be lifted up out of the earth, will draw all to me" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#12:32">John  12:32</a>): God has called us to "the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:9">1 Corinthians  1:9</a>).<a name=50:9></a> There is, on the other side, that which is perfectly consistent with it, the fellowship of His death.<a name=50:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have in mind, beloved brethren, to speak of some of the features of the last days; having before me that we should not merely avoid the unsavoury features which are delineated in such detail in the Holy Scriptures, but that we should avoid them feelingly, feeling about them as God does, and as Christ does; and then also, that we should take account of the positive features of these last days.<a name=65:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		No one will deny, surely, that we are in the last days.<a name=65:3></a> Conditions around, the increasing corruption in the social circles of men, the increasing darkness religiously, and the state of things politically, are in themselves evidence that we are in the last days; but there are other evidences of a positive character, as we see what corresponds with our Lord's statement: "But learn the parable from the fig-tree: When already its branch becomes tender and produces leaves, ye know that the summer is near" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#24:32">Matthew  24:32</a>).<a name=65:4></a> The increasing affections seen amongst the people of God are in themselves very powerful evidence that we stand in the last days; and it would seem that the last days -- whether of one's life, or of a period in the ways of God, or of a dispensation -- are peculiarly challenging; they are not only challenging, but as showing forth some features that commend themselves and are delightful to divine Persons, they become evidence that "the

		<a name=66>[Page 66]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		summer is near".<a name=66:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One would refer in passing to the last days of Isaac.<a name=66:2></a> He had had unique and marvellous opportunities; he had become exceedingly great, waxing greater and greater until he became very great, but his closing days were days that the Spirit of God speaks of in a most solemn way, for you remember how he said to his son Esau, "I am become old; I know not the day of my death" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#27:2">Genesis  27:2</a>), and, instead of preparing for the day of his death, he requested that he might have venison; indeed, the word says that he "loved Esau, because venison was to his taste" (chapter 25: 28).<a name=66:3></a> Think of Isaac, a man in his closing days, marked by blindness, having tastes which we may soberly speak of as vitiated, as longing for something from an Esau!<a name=66:4></a> I suppose that for the last twenty years or more of his life he was blind.<a name=66:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You remember, too, how the last of the judges was marked by blindness, Samson having his eyes put out (<a href="../bible/Judges.htm#16:21">Judges  16:21</a>).<a name=66:6></a> And again, the last of the kings, Zedekiah, was marked by blindness (<a href="../bible/2Kings.htm#25:7">2 Kings  25:7</a>).<a name=66:7></a> Then you remember that in the post-captivity days, the priests were said to despise Jehovah's name -- what a serious state is disclosed in those last days of the dispensation under law, when the priests despised Jehovah's name and men robbed God, without feeling (<a href="../bible/Malachi.htm#1:6">Malachi  1:6</a>; <a href="../bible/Malachi.htm#3:8">Malachi  3:8</a>) .<a name=66:8></a> Again, it is said of Laodicea, one of the last phases of the assembly's history upon earth, that she is wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked, and knows it not -- the most
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=67>[Page 67]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		solemn feature of all is that she knows it not; she is indeed heartless as to Christ, and He is said to be outside the door knocking (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:14">Revelation  3:14</a> - 20).<a name=67:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Over against these features, we have a Jacob, a man of whom, though the Spirit of God says that his eyes were dim so that "he could not see" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#48:10">Genesis  48:10</a>), He is careful to say that it was Israel's eyes that were dim, not Jacob's.<a name=67:2></a> If his natural eyes were dim that he could not see, his spiritual sensibilities were alert.<a name=67:3></a> He was never greater in his life than at that peculiar juncture, as he worshipped on the top of his staff, and blessed both the sons of Joseph (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:21">Hebrews  11:21</a>).<a name=67:4></a> He was greater in spiritual stature and power than he had ever been, for he was with God; and his eyes were closed to all things here.<a name=67:5></a> <i>He</i> made no request for venison; though his eyes were dim and set, he was marked by spiritual sensibilities and knew what was suitable to God.<a name=67:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, as against the blindness of Samson, and the failure of the people in the days of the judges, we have a Boaz, we have the reapers, we have a Ruth, and the most marvellous activities in "the days when the judges ruled" (<a href="../bible/Ruth.htm#1:1">Ruth  1:1</a>).<a name=67:7></a> Over against the failure of the kings, and peculiarly in the last days of the kingdom, we have a Jeremiah.<a name=67:8></a> Thank God for men and women who feel things with God, and are like God in the last days.<a name=67:9></a> Jeremiah was a man of intense feeling; he was a weeper, and his weeping was but the external evidence of the deepest internal emotion.<a name=67:10></a> Again, we have an Ezekiel, one who "saw visions of God" (<a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#1:1">Ezekiel  1:1</a>), one who could tell
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=68>[Page 68]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		much about the glory, the remarkable feature about Ezekiel being this, that he always knew the whereabouts of divine glory.<a name=68:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Again, in contrast to the failure of the priests and Levites and the common persons in the main, we have this remarkably sweet passage: "Then they that feared Jehovah spoke often one to another; and Jehovah observed it, and heard" (<a href="../bible/Malachi.htm#3:16">Malachi  3:16</a>).<a name=68:2></a> I believe that corresponds to these last days: "Then they that feared Jehovah spoke often one to another".<a name=68:3></a> If I understood that, would I ever say that there were too many meetings?<a name=68:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If I understood the precious volume of the Lord's speaking to us in the last days, would I ever complain that there is too much ministry -- either orally or written?<a name=68:5></a> Never: "they that feared Jehovah spoke often one to another; and Jehovah observed it, and heard".<a name=68:6></a> Then, over against the heartlessness, the blindness and wretchedness of Laodicea, we have the precious features of Philadelphia.<a name=68:7></a> These things stand in sharp contrast; for if Laodicea is heartless, if she has need of nothing, not even of Christ -- for that is the inference -- Philadelphia has a little strength, she has kept His word and not denied His name, and moreover she has an "opened door" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:8">Revelation  3:8</a>).<a name=68:8></a> I believe we have that in these last days, an opened door, and the Lord has promised that if He opens, no one shall shut.<a name=68:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence my desire and exercise is that we should take account of the features that mark these last days.<a name=68:10></a> Paul speaks of them, and, in the first scripture
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=69>[Page 69]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that I read, we have a long list of the most sordid things which characterise men in the last days.<a name=69:1></a> "Difficult times", indeed, but, thank God, not too difficult to go on as "lovers of God".<a name=69:2></a> I believe sometimes we read Scripture too quickly.<a name=69:3></a> This list in <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#3">2 Timothy  3</a>is a list which ought to be read slowly and carefully and with deep feeling, for it represents a state of things we have to meet and pass through, and we need great strength and grace for it.<a name=69:4></a> We need to be much with God if we are to pass through such a scene for His pleasure.<a name=69:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Men are said to be "lovers of self" -- that is the first thing, for above everything else a man will be a lover of himself -- lovers of money, lovers of pleasure, three things which abound in these last days.<a name=69:6></a> There are other things stated in this solemn list which remind us of the first chapter of Romans, where all the depravity of the human heart is depicted in such graphic language by the Spirit of God.<a name=69:7></a> If the list is not the same in actual detail it is the same morally, and with this terrible added feature, that with all the sordid things men do, they have a "form of piety"; it is cloaked over with the profession of Christianity; many of these vile things, coming from the pit, clothe themselves with the very name of Christ -- a thing we ought to feel.<a name=69:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But over against that list, we have this remarkable expression, "lovers of God".<a name=69:9></a> I believe, if the features of which I have spoken abound in these last days, there are also, thank God, features which belong to those who are described by this exquisite
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=70>[Page 70]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		designation, "lovers of God".<a name=70:1></a> I covet, beloved brethren, to see the number of the lovers of God increased in these last days, not merely persons whom God loves, but persons who love God.<a name=70:2></a> In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:28">Romans  8:28</a> we read: "all things work together for good to those who love God".<a name=70:3></a> I believe that is the line upon which we should encourage one another, and upon which we should encourage believers in the systems of men with whom we come in contact, that the features belonging to lovers of God should be found multiplying and greatly increasing in these last moments before our Lord Jesus returns.<a name=70:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I desire to refer to three special features which should mark "lovers of God"; and for these I turn to the beloved apostles Peter, Paul, and John.<a name=70:5></a> I am aware that I am saying nothing new or novel.<a name=70:6></a> Were I addressing a company of Athenians, I should have to strive to say something new, for you remember that they "spent their time in nothing else than to tell and to hear the news" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#17:21">Acts  17:21</a>).<a name=70:7></a> Let us guard against that.<a name=70:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I have the happy precedent set up by the apostle Peter in striving to put you in mind of things that you already know.<a name=70:9></a> Four times in his second epistle he speaks of "putting you in remembrance", or similar language, and once he says, "I will be careful to put you always in mind of these things, <i>although knowing them</i>" (chapter 1: 12, 13, 15; 3: 1).<a name=70:10></a> We need to have our affections stirred, our pure minds stirred, and Peter, the aged apostle, speaks in the most tender way possible, almost apologetically, in
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=71>[Page 71]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		addressing the true believers of his day, desiring that after his departure these things should be always in their remembrance.<a name=71:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first feature that Peter would impress upon the lovers of God stands in relation to their walk, for in the last days we shall be tested as to how we walk; and his first word, after telling us that "the end of all things is drawn nigh", is that we should be sober.<a name=71:2></a> That surely becomes a lover of God.<a name=71:3></a> There is great need for sobriety in these last days.<a name=71:4></a> Then he says, "be watchful unto prayers".<a name=71:5></a> I believe, as we pray more, as we "persevere in prayer", as Colossians says (chapter 4: 2), and give ourselves to it, we shall be saved and preserved from the unholy features which are found in the last days.<a name=71:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then Peter says, "having fervent love among yourselves".<a name=71:7></a> That surely is a most precious feature of the lovers of God.<a name=71:8></a> Think of a Theophilus, a man, not only loved by God, as his name indicates, but a true lover of God.<a name=71:9></a> "Having fervent love among yourselves".<a name=71:10></a> Let us examine our own hearts; let us challenge our motives; let our minds go back now to our several localities and see whether this feature marks us; have we fervent love among ourselves?<a name=71:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then he says, "hospitable one to another, without murmuring".<a name=71:12></a> We know that the world loves its own, and we believe that the world, in a certain sense, will care for its own, but how one loves to dwell upon the increasing hospitality amongst the people of God in these last days!<a name=71:13></a> Fathers, mothers, houses, lands, brothers, sisters, indeed a hundredfold more
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=72>[Page 72]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#10:29">Mark  10:29</a>, 30) -- that is the position in the last days.<a name=72:1></a> Thank God there is this abundant hospitality, and shown without murmuring.<a name=72:2></a> The last thing that Peter would lay upon the consciences and hearts of the lovers of God is this, that they should do all things to the glory of God: "that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory and the might for the ages of ages".<a name=72:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But if Peter would address the lovers of God in relation to their walk, Paul would address them in relation to their service and the ministry.<a name=72:4></a> Hence we have that remarkably solemn word, "I testify before God and Christ Jesus, who is about to judge living and dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom, proclaim the word" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#4:1">2 Timothy  4:1</a>) -- a valuable word to young believers -- "proclaim the word", and may I say in affection, be concerned about the condition in which men are; not so much about subjects finely rounded off, but preach the word, for men are perishing.<a name=72:5></a> Men are in the state described in <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#3">2 Timothy  3</a>, lovers of self, lovers of money, lovers of pleasure, rather than lovers of God: so "proclaim the word; be urgent".<a name=72:6></a> It is a time of urgency; I believe we ought to feel that; we must waste no time.<a name=72:7></a> Hence one is comforted and greatly encouraged by the increasing number of gospel preachings among us.<a name=72:8></a> But we need more than that: we need the personal touch; we need the compulsion of grace, so that we might get into touch with men privately and individually.<a name=72:9></a> "Be urgent in season and out of season".<a name=72:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=73>[Page 73]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then he says, "fill up the full measure of thy ministry", a word which should challenge and yet encourage every one who seeks to serve.<a name=73:1></a> One feels in regard of oneself how inherently lazy one may be, and I believe with many of us there is great need for the word to Archippus, "Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, to the end that thou fulfil it" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#4:17">Colossians  4:17</a>).<a name=73:2></a> "Fill up the full measure of thy ministry".<a name=73:3></a> Thank God for the ministers and for the ministry, but let us not slack off in the slightest degree.<a name=73:4></a> Some may say, You do too much, and there may be many exhortations as to the body, and it is something to reflect over that the conversations among us lie so often in relation to the body.<a name=73:5></a> I believe -- and I speak soberly -- that where we have one inquiry as to soul-health we have a hundred as to the health of our bodies!<a name=73:6></a> I am not belittling the fact that the body is the Lord's, but like Epaphroditus, we have to regard the work as urgent, to be urgent and fill up the full measure of our ministry, for the apostolic energy has ceased.<a name=73:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Marvellous energy had the apostles -- marvellous energy had the men of God a century ago, without the comfortable conditions of travelling and the rapid means of transit we enjoy.<a name=73:8></a> One marvels at what they must have passed through in their desires to serve "so great a people" (<a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#3:9">1 Kings  3:9</a>, Authorised Version).<a name=73:9></a> Let us then be urgent, and let us not think too much of comfort; let us be concerned about the work and about the ministry.<a name=73:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have only one word further, and that stands in
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=74>[Page 74]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		relation to John's exhortation and ministry, for I believe that John would be concerned about our affections -- not now our walk, or our service, the preaching or the ministry, but our affections, a most touching matter.<a name=74:1></a> So we are reminded in the last chapter in the Bible that "the time is near", and that a divine fixity is about to be established, when the unrighteous shall be unrighteous still, when the unholy or filthy shall be filthy still, but when the righteous and the holy shall be righteous and holy still.<a name=74:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then John hears a remarkable word, "Behold, I come quickly, and my reward with me, to render to every one as his work shall be".<a name=74:3></a> Then we have: "And the Spirit and the bride say, Come".<a name=74:4></a> If there is urgency in the preaching, there is urgency in the affections of the saints: "And the Spirit and the bride say, Come".<a name=74:5></a> Nor is that all, for we are not to forget divine compassions; we are not to forget that many of our brethren (with sorrow we say it) are in the systems of men, in places where little or nothing is known of the Lord's coming.<a name=74:6></a> Hence we have that word: "And let him that hears say, Come", a word to believers who need stirring up in this matter of bridal affections for Christ.<a name=74:7></a> Then, in the com-passions which are marking us as preaching the word and being urgent in season and out of season, we have again, "he that will, let him take the water of life freely".<a name=74:8></a> Thank God for that!<a name=74:9></a> It is as if to the very last moment of our stay here on earth, we are to be charged with divine compassions and the sense of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=75>[Page 75]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the divine hunger after men.<a name=75:1></a> Then we have this word, "Yea, I come quickly", and the exceedingly precious response from hearts characterised by incorruptible affections for Christ is, "Amen; come, Lord Jesus".<a name=75:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We were motoring some few months ago from the south of England to the north, and ran into a dense fog which became so trying that we were inclined to give up, and just as we were about to do so, a lad of about nine years of age cried out and said, Keep going, sir, the sun is shining at the top of the hill!<a name=75:3></a> That is the word, dear brethren we are to keep going.<a name=75:4></a> Whatever the last days may be characterised by, in the evil disposition and depravity of the human heart, we are to keep going.<a name=75:5></a> Not only is 'the sun shining' in John's ministry, but we should seek that pure atmosphere in the elevation that John speaks of: "Come up here" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#4:1">Revelation  4:1</a>), then we shall pass through the murky fogs of earth, through all that is transpiring in this present evil world, having this unique and blessed feature -- this blessed hope in our hearts, which Peter says, is "until the day dawn and the morning star arise in your hearts" (<a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#1:19">2 Peter  1:19</a>).<a name=75:6></a> The One for whom we look has told us that He Himself is "the bright and morning star" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:16">Revelation  22:16</a>).<a name=75:7></a>

		May the Lord greatly help us, so that, in our walk, in our service and ministry, and in our affections, we may set forth the features that belong to the lovers of God in these last days.<a name=75:8></a> There is every reason why we should love God.<a name=75:9></a> He has

		We might think of the Lord here in His manhood and consider the detail of His life, but I believe the apostle would tell us, in a few short sentences, what kind of Man this is that we are enjoined to follow.<a name=78:5></a> It says, "who did no sin": the Model we have is perfect.<a name=78:6></a> "Neither was guile found in his mouth": a Man whose word could be trusted absolutely.<a name=78:7></a> Not only did He speak the truth -- that would be so -- but there was no guile in Him.<a name=78:8></a> "Who, when reviled, reviled not again; when suffering, threatened not".<a name=78:9></a> What kind of Man is this, "who, when reviled, reviled not again"?<a name=78:10></a> You see, what I am trying to get at is the spirit of the Man in whose steps we are enjoined to follow.<a name=78:11></a> "Who, when reviled, reviled not again; when suffering, threatened not; but gave himself over into the hands of him who judges righteously".<a name=78:12></a> That brings out a very important principle.<a name=78:13></a> We may calculate what the outcome will be if we do certain things and follow certain lines.<a name=78:14></a> I do not think the Lord did that.<a name=78:15></a> He always did what was right.<a name=78:16></a> He left the outcome in "the hands of him who judges righteously".<a name=78:17></a> Another has said that when He went out of the garden of Gethsemane, after

		I close with a reference to Joshua, because, if we truly follow the Lord, we find our way into the realm of divine privilege.<a name=83:7></a> That also, I would say, is a matter of true affection.<a name=83:8></a> It says here, "When ye see the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then remove from your place, and go after it".<a name=83:9></a> These persons, in the literal history of the matter, followed the ark from the wilderness to a Jordan that was empty of water, and then they went into the land itself, into the fulness of God's thoughts for them.<a name=83:10></a> I would say this to each one of us, as we follow the Lord in our exercises -- household, business, or assembly exercises -- what we will come to, I believe, is something of the fulness of divine privilege as we enter into divine things, and experience at the present time what it is to be with Christ in His own realm.<a name=83:11></a> What will take you there?<a name=83:12></a> True affection for Christ, and the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=83:13></a> As we remarked already, "<i>We</i> love because <i>he</i> has first loved us".<a name=83:14></a>

		So far I have only spoken of what was the proper fellowship of Christians to begin with.<a name=84:12></a> John puts it on this ground: "if we walk in the light as <i>he</i> is in the light" (chapter 1: 7); that is, if we are really in the truth of Christianity, namely, that God has been pleased to come out in the fullest revelation of Himself, so that there can be no further revelation of Him, that God's thought and grace in regard of man is revealed in the Lord Jesus Christ, then, "we have fellowship with one another".<a name=84:13></a> And at the present time, and at every time, there is fellowship, and it is in the true light of Christianity.<a name=84:14></a> And the true light of Christianity is displayed in the Lord; you cannot learn it elsewhere.<a name=84:15></a> Therefore I can understand the apostle saying to the Philippian gaoler, "Believe on the Lord Jesus" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16:31">Acts  16:31</a>); as much as to say to him, You get into

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think it is very beautiful to know that there is one point where you can fully learn what is in the heart of God toward man, and you see it displayed not in weakness, but in glory, in power.<a name=85:2></a> There is no power to equal the power of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=85:3></a> Talk about power in this world, and what nations and man can do, it is not to be compared to the power of the Lord Jesus!<a name=85:4></a> He went to the right hand of God, and received and sent down here the most mighty Power that could be, the Holy Spirit.<a name=85:5></a> Christ can effect everything, only He effects it spiritually, not yet in the way of display; but He effects everything in the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=85:6></a>

		Nothing can stand against the power of the Spirit.<a name=85:7></a> We may have so little faith that we are unable to use the power; but if we had faith to use the power of the Spirit, I say nothing could stand before it.<a name=85:8></a> A servant might be in the presence of the most godless company that ever was brought together: if he knew what it was to be in faith and in the power of the Spirit, some of that company would be brought down before him.<a name=85:9></a> I am ashamed to talk about it, because I know so poorly how to use the power of the Spirit.<a name=85:10></a> But the Spirit is here, having come down from Christ, and Christ has all power over man for man's good and blessing.<a name=85:11></a> All the thought of God towards man is revealed in the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the light of the Lord "we have fellowship with one another".<a name=85:12></a>

		Now in a day of ruin, I find exactly the same principle, only that another question comes in, that you cannot commit yourself to people simply on their profession, you cannot take people up quite as they did at the beginning of Christianity.<a name=86:1></a> Things have lapsed into a condition of ruin; profession has become common and unreal; there are vessels to dishonour; and therefore you have to look for those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.<a name=86:2></a> But the ground of fellowship remains unchanged, and the ground of fellowship is calling on the Lord.<a name=86:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is very important to rightly apprehend fellowship, because fellowship brings in a different idea to that of the actual meeting.<a name=86:4></a> If people become associated with us in fellowship, it does not simply mean that they have the privilege of breaking bread, but we are bound to do all we can for them, they are received into our fellowship.<a name=86:5></a> So, too, if they are put out of our fellowship they are put out of it, it is not putting them away from the meeting, but that you have no more to say to them until God comes in in grace to restore them.<a name=86:6></a>

		It appears sometimes to be thought that in cases of discipline persons are put away from the meeting.<a name=86:7></a> It is not simply a question of the meeting, our fellowship subsists whether there is a meeting or not: we might not be able to come together to a meeting, but that would not affect the question of our fellowship; we have fellowship one with another, following "righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure

		My thought is to say a word about Paul and his ministry.<a name=97:1></a> It is of all importance that we should pay attention to Paul, for he presents to us in his ministry what may be regarded as our specific light.<a name=97:2></a> There is a certain light in which we, as partakers of the heavenly calling, are to shine, and that light is Paul's ministry.<a name=97:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have no doubt that in the ministry of the twelve, especially in Peter's address on the day of Pentecost, we have Israel's light.<a name=97:4></a> I do not deny that the chapter presents what is distinctively Christian, for it does, but Peter says, "to you is the promise" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:39">Acts  2:39</a>); that is to say, to Israel, it was Israel's moment.<a name=97:5></a> The rejected Messiah was in heaven, and He was in heaven on their account.<a name=97:6></a> He gave the Spirit, and it was therefore a moment of marvellous light for them, a moment in which we may introduce chapter 60 of the prophet Isaiah; "Arise, shine!<a name=97:7></a> for thy light is come, and the glory of Jehovah is risen upon thee" (verse 1).<a name=97:8></a> It was a moment of marvellous light for Israel: Peter testified, that as in heaven, the Lord Jesus had "poured out this which <i>ye</i> behold and hear" (verse 33).<a name=97:9></a> It was the moment in which Israel might have shaken themselves from the dust and shone in their light.<a name=97:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul's light is to endure.<a name=98:10></a> In chapter 3 of the second letter to Timothy he calls attention to his doctrine and his manner of life (verses 10, 11), and I read this passage (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20">Acts  20</a>) because it embodies the two thoughts; it speaks of the manner of man he was, and the teaching he presented to the saints.<a name=98:11></a> The man who is to stand in the latter and difficult days is supposed to know these things; he is supposed to be acquainted with Paul's doctrine and with Paul's manner of life.<a name=98:12></a> It is possible to divorce the doctrine from the manner of life, but if the manner of life is not in accord with the doctrine, the doctrine must become a dead letter; they go together.<a name=98:13></a> If you have the doctrine and the manner of life in agreement, you have the luminous body upon earth.<a name=98:14></a> The person whose soul is in the light of Paul's doctrine, and whose life is in accord with it, is a luminous body, a heavenly body; he shines in his own light.<a name=98:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I wish to show you, if I can, how the Spirit of God in the Acts leads up to this point; that is to say, He leads up to a point where we find a company of men and women to whom Paul could disclose freely "all the counsel of God".<a name=98:16></a> What a pleasure to Paul to be able to bring forward that which his heart cherished, and to speak freely and fully of every part

		of the divine counsels!<a name=99:1></a> My conception of those who shall throng the courts on high is that they are intelligent; they answer to Abigail, the last type, as I understand it, of the assembly in the Old Testament; they are of a "good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance" (<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#25:3">1 Samuel  25:3</a>).<a name=99:2></a> Those courts shall be thronged with such people.<a name=99:3></a> On earth there shall be a people, but not their equal; they shall have God's laws in their hearts, they shall answer in that way to righteousness here, their hearts and minds shall be controlled by God's laws and their sins forgiven, but in the courts on high we shall see the assembly in its glory as formed by Paul's ministry.<a name=99:4></a> She will be marked by a good understanding, a full, intelligent apprehension of all the divine secrets, and a beautiful countenance.<a name=99:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish to show also, if I can, the order in which the Spirit of God leads us to that point.<a name=99:6></a> I take the liberty of going back to chapter 6 of the Acts, and here I would remind you that the Spirit of God inserts nothing in Scripture without a purpose, and He omits nothing without a purpose, and what He records in the end of chapter 6 is that a man appears whose countenance is as that of an angel's (verse 15); he is a remarkable man.<a name=99:7></a> You will all remember that Stephen was one of those deputed by the apostles to serve tables.<a name=99:8></a> Beloved friends, if we ever regard the work that refers to the support of the saints as beneath us, those whom we depute to accomplish it shall shine in our stead.<a name=99:9></a> Stephen and Philip shone not only as table-servers, but as ministers of divine

		Now in the passage from Isaiah read by the eunuch you have the Man whose "life is taken from the earth" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#8:33">Acts  8:33</a>); that is an important element in the development of the testimony.<a name=101:6></a> "His life is taken from the earth", but Stephen saw Him in heaven, and the Ethiopian read about Him.<a name=101:7></a> "Who shall declare His generation?<a name=101:8></a> for his life is taken from the earth".<a name=101:9></a> He is a heavenly Man.<a name=101:10></a> He belongs to heaven, His life is taken from the earth.<a name=101:11></a> It reminds one of Isaac walking in the fields.<a name=101:12></a> You all remember that Isaac is typically the heavenly man.<a name=101:13></a> Directly we have the testimony of his resurrection, that is to say, in type the resurrection of Christ, you have the genealogy of Rebecca.<a name=101:14></a> Isaac is claimed from heaven, remember that.<a name=101:15></a> The angel called to Abraham out of heaven (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#22:11">Genesis  22:11</a>).<a name=101:16></a> Isaac, as typifying Christ, belonged to heaven, and he must have a companion, and his companion is to be equal to him, she is of the same genealogy.<a name=101:17></a> "Who shall declare his generation?<a name=101:18></a> for his life is taken from the earth".<a name=101:19></a>

		Now you can readily perceive how many thoughts enter into that: they have come out of Egypt and they are in the wilderness.<a name=105:12></a> I need not remind you that Corinth is the wilderness; it was adverse for the saints of God in every possible way, and yet they were in it, taken account of, and called God's assembly in it.<a name=105:13></a> God's honour is bound up with that people, His order is to be seen there, His government is to be seen there, and every member of that company is to recognise that it is God's assembly, not man's; and in that assembly there is everything requisite for its support, maintenance and order.<a name=105:14></a> It was God's building, God's temple, and it was Christ's body in that city.<a name=105:15></a> Now all that was brought to pass through Paul's ministry.<a name=105:16></a> The Lord stood by him until the saints at Corinth were

		Paul says with great certainty, "I know that, coming to you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of Christ".<a name=114:3></a> There is no doubt that the Lord Jesus has blessing in mind for His people, and the way that the gifts are distributed in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4">Ephesians  4</a>, coming down from the ascended Head, would have in mind the way that they operate for profit and for edification to the Lord's people, to the end that we should "all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God" (verse 13).<a name=114:4></a> Blessing is to flow through those who serve the Lord, and Paul speaks of it so attractively here.<a name=114:5></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the same way we are brought in individually as members of the body, we are all baptised into it in that sense, but the very fact of being members of one body identifies us with the body, you cannot be apart from the body.<a name=118:3></a> So it is in regard to children.<a name=118:4></a> The moment I wake up to the fact that I am a child of God, that that is the place of privilege to which the Father has called me, at once I want to be identified with the company; that is the way in which it works, for there is no such idea as a single child of God.<a name=118:5></a> We are brought into that place by one Spirit; it is one Spirit that "bears witness with our spirit, that we are children of God" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:16">Romans  8:16</a>), we are all one by one Spirit.<a name=118:6></a> The very instinct of one who realises that he is a child of God must lead him to the truth of the assembly, because he feels he cannot be alone.<a name=118:7></a> It is expressed in the line of a hymn with which we are all familiar:

	<div class="paragraph">
		<blockquote>'In Him we stand, a heav'nly band, <br> Where He Himself is gone' (<a href=".<a name=118:8></a>.<a name=118:9></a>\hymns\hymns1972.<a name=118:10></a>htm#12:2">Hymn 12</a>).<a name=118:11></a> </blockquote>

	<div class="paragraph">
		privilege of a single individual.<a name=119:1></a> The Spirit that bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God is the same Spirit in every Christian.<a name=119:2></a> I cannot under-stand a Christian content to be isolated and talking about how much he gets from the Lord at home; I am certain that person enters little into the privilege of a child, for if he did, the craving of his soul would be to get into the company of the children; because as there is one flock and one Shepherd, so the children are all one band.<a name=119:3></a> If therefore you want to realise the privilege of the children of God, you must get to the assembly; and it is there that you realise the privilege which is proper to the children of God, they worship the Father.<a name=119:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now nothing can deny that to us.<a name=119:5></a> Just as in the ruin of the church there is the fellowship of "those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:22">2 Timothy  2:22</a>), so whatever may be the decay and ruin of the church, the children cannot be displaced.<a name=119:6></a> I may be very sorry that all do not enter into their privilege, and I am sure we ought to mourn over it more than we do; but if we do come together in assembly, then our place as children is realised, for it is the calling, the privilege, which the Father has bestowed upon us.<a name=119:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I can understand in a day of ruin that a person might say, Well, I have got a little light, and it has separated me from the confusion around; I cannot go on with the sects and systems because they are a practical denial of the truth of the Lord; I will stand completely alone.<a name=119:8></a> But I do not think a person could

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The same holds good as to sonship, it is one Spirit of sonship.<a name=120:3></a> I am sure we fail to see how that the scriptures which apply to Christians are instinct with unity, all is to bring us to unity; and if you have the Spirit of sonship, the Spirit that witnesses that you are a child of God, there will be a kind of magnetic attraction towards other children of God, and of other children of God towards you.<a name=120:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe it is for that reason that John gives us what I should call essential truths when the structure has broken down.<a name=120:5></a> The expression "children of God" involves what is vital; the Spirit bears witness, there is the spiritual link, and though you may mourn the fact that you cannot come together in company with the whole band, yet at the same time you cannot lose sight of the privilege which belongs to you in common with other Christians.<a name=120:6></a> If the Father has set you in that place of children, the Father's love is upon you, you are "in the Son and in the Father" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:24">1 John  2:24</a>).<a name=120:7></a>

		Now I pass on to the third point, and that is testimony, in that God is in us.<a name=120:8></a> In verses 12 to 14 of <a href="../bible/1John.htm#4">1 John  4</a>we come to "us" and "we".<a name=120:9></a> And mark what a wonderful testimony that passage presents; "No

		<a name=121>[Page 121]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		one has seen God at any time".<a name=121:1></a> That is an expression which is used first in the gospel, where it goes on to say, "the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, <i>he</i> hath declared him" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:18">John  1:18</a>): here it is, "No one has seen God at any time: if we love one another, God abides in us, and his love is perfected in us"; that is, that the divine nature is made good in Christians, in that they love one another, and the character of the love is such that the love of God is perfected in us.<a name=121:2></a> The wonderful thing is that God is displayed, not in one Christian, but in the company of Christians, in their love one toward another.<a name=121:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now mark the next passage: "Hereby we know that we abide in him and he in us, that he has given to us of his Spirit.<a name=121:4></a> And <i>we</i> have seen" -- now you get another thing -- "and testify, that the Father has sent the Son as Saviour of the world".<a name=121:5></a> It is a wonderful thing that there is a band here in the world in whom the love of God is perfected, and more than that, they have seen and bear witness that the Father sent the Son as Saviour of the world.<a name=121:6></a> I doubt if it is an individual bearing witness, but the testimony is maintained in the band; that is the light that comes out in the band.<a name=121:7></a> But then the first point is not what they say, it is what they are: "if we love one another", that is what I was speaking about at the beginning in regard to testimony.<a name=121:8></a> It answers again to that passage in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>, "as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us"; that is their place of privilege.<a name=121:9></a> But they are to be "one in

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Of course, in the thought of God, all these things were to have been witnessed in the entire church.<a name=122:3></a> But what is perfectly clear to me from Scripture is that even in early days comparatively few Christians entered into the proper privileges of the church: the majority were uncommonly slow to accept their true place and privilege.<a name=122:4></a> I argue from it that if comparatively few Christians entered in that day into proper christian privilege, there is no reason why a few Christians should not enter into it in this day.<a name=122:5></a> It is one thing to have a privilege belonging to me, and another thing to enter into the truth and reality of it.<a name=122:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But I maintain that the privilege belongs to all, that the Father has set His love upon us, that the proper place of every Christian is to be of one band, in the Father and in the Son.<a name=122:7></a> It is our place, and in the realisation of our privilege we better understand the true character of the assembly.<a name=122:8></a> And it is apart from any necessity of ecclesiastical pretension.<a name=122:9></a> The point is to have the reality of it in our souls.<a name=122:10></a> Things must come out in the order I have indicated; and if saints do not understand the privilege of the assembly in some measure, there will not be maintained in them a testimony which is according to God.<a name=122:11></a> It is in the assembly that we properly enter into our relationship with the Father and with one another; you may have accepted the light of it, but it is in the assembly you enter into and understand it.<a name=122:12></a> Properly we are all set in our place in the assembly,

		in regard to the Father and to Christ and to one another; and then we go forth from the assembly to be here in the world a vessel in which God is displayed.<a name=123:1></a> You must take these things up in the order in which they are unfolded in the epistle, our souls are bound to learn them in that order: first fellowship, then privilege which places us in the Father and in the Son, and then true testimony in which God is displayed in the heavenly band which stands in Christ; that is the divine order.<a name=123:2></a> I could show you precisely the same order coming out in Paul.<a name=123:3></a> You could not understand Colossians if you did not first understand Corinthians; in Corinthians you get fellowship, and the privilege of the assembly, and in Colossians you get the other side of it, that is, the divine nature coming out in the christian company.<a name=123:4></a>

		I do not want to dwell further on it, but I trust it will be a practical word to all of us.<a name=123:5></a> I took it up from this epistle as being suitable to the day of ruin in which we are; and I pray God to grant that we may be more prepared in spirit to come under the sense of the ruin, not to attempt to construct something here which is a kind of satisfaction to us.<a name=123:6></a> God keep us from setting up any kind of imitation!<a name=123:7></a> May we recognise that the church is here both vitally and responsibly, but so far as the thought of God is concerned, it is here in ruin.<a name=123:8></a> I take my share in the shame of the ruin; but at the same time I see, and this ought to be a great encouragement to us, that all that is essential abides, and I believe that if we enter

		The effect on the Thessalonians of seeing behind the scenes was that they were able to turn their backs on the world, its politics and its religion, and to wait for God's Son from heaven.<a name=126:11></a> They were able to stand in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=126:12></a> Christianity is the knowledge of God in grace and of the Lord Jesus Christ as the Man through whom all God's purposes will come in and be made good.<a name=126:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And now what are these spiritual faculties?<a name=127:4></a> Verse 3 tells us, "remembering unceasingly your work of faith, and labour of love, and enduring constancy of hope, of our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father".<a name=127:5></a> Faith, love and hope are our spiritual faculties and the Thessalonians did not seek to exercise their natural senses in these things.<a name=127:6></a> It would be no good, for we receive spiritual faculties for spiritual things.<a name=127:7></a> The whole of the epistle shows how these faculties are to be exercised, so that they may grow and develop; if not we shall become spiritually dwarfed and not be for the pleasure of God.<a name=127:8></a> No matter how fond the parents of a new-born babe may be of their child, they expect it to grow and develop mentally and physically, and thus it is with the one who is born of God; God looks for the spiritual faculties to come into play and thus we grow and develop and are to His pleasure.<a name=127:9></a>

		First of all, Daniel determined that he would not defile himself with the king's meat nor with the wine which he drank (chapter 1: 8).<a name=131:4></a> He determined that he would not feed upon that which the world feeds upon, nor enjoy its pleasures.<a name=131:5></a> Let us likewise determine that we will not defile ourselves with what provides food for the lust of the flesh, or the lust of the eyes, or the pride of life.<a name=131:6></a> It is a matter of reaching the thing in our minds.<a name=131:7></a> Everyone would admit failure and weakness, but it is a question of the attitude of our mind.<a name=131:8></a> In the world, a luxurious diet is provided for men, a kingly diet that will build up giants, as it was in the end of the period before the flood.<a name=131:9></a> It says, "In those days were the giants on the earth" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#6:4">Genesis  6:4</a>), and the same characteristics are arising in men today -- giants in pride, in lust, and in covetousness; but Daniel determined that he would not eat the king's meat.<a name=131:10></a>

		There is no question but that we take character from what we eat.<a name=132:5></a> If a man eats what is corrupt, he becomes corrupt; if we feed upon Christ, the inevitable result will be that features of Christ will be seen.<a name=132:6></a> Pulse and water is no doubt a reference to Christ in His lowly, blessed character, something like the manna, and Daniel comes out in His character.<a name=132:7></a> If he had turned aside to eat the king's food and to drink his wine, he would have been missing at the end, but it says he continued to the reign of Cyrus.<a name=132:8></a>

		Another feature that greatly helped Daniel was that he was in touch with the God of heaven; his outlook was not towards the earth.<a name=132:9></a> Over and over again he speaks of "the God of the heavens" -- a magnificent title for us to take account of in these days.<a name=132:10></a> How magnificent is the order, the rule and the beauty of heaven, and what a wonderful sphere it is!<a name=132:11></a> As God said to Job, "Knowest thou the ordinances of the heavens?<a name=132:12></a> dost thou determine their rule over the earth?<a name=132:13></a>" (<a href="../bible/Job.htm#38:33">Job  38:33</a>).<a name=132:14></a> It is only on earth that there

		Another feature is that he opened his window towards Jerusalem three times a day, and kneeled down and prayed and gave thanks ''as he did aforetime"(chapter 6: 10).<a name=133:7></a> The Spirit of God takes away the veil from one of the secrets of Daniel's life in saying, ''as he did aforetime" - this was his custom.<a name=133:8></a> We often hear today about customs among God's people.<a name=133:9></a> Would that this custom of Daniel's was increasingly one of them.<a name=133:10></a> A man like that is bound to go through.<a name=133:11></a> "They shall prosper that love thee", says the psalmist, of Jerusalem (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#122:6">Psalm  122:6</a>).<a name=133:12></a> "If I forget thee, Jerusalem, let my right hand forget its skill" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#137:5">Psalm  137:5</a>).<a name=133:13></a> Daniel did not forget Jerusalem, his outlook was not himself, or his own blessing or service, but it was the city of God, the assembly, in

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then it says he gave thanks.<a name=134:11></a> If we do not give thanks we shall drop out; for murmurers and complainers always drop out of the testimony.<a name=134:12></a> In the darkest day there is always reason, not only to pray, but to give thanks, as viewing the work and the thoughts of God, and His delight in bringing to pass His own will.<a name=134:13></a> A man who prays and gives thanks with his windows open toward Jerusalem will go through to the end, he will not be diverted.<a name=134:14></a>

		When the princes, the leading men in Darius' day, sought to terminate Daniel's position in the testimony, they examined all his affairs and they found that he was faithful (chapter 6: 4).<a name=135:7></a> When they looked into the matter of his stewardship under Darius, they found they could not touch him on that account, for he was faithful in everything.<a name=135:8></a> We shall certainly drop out if that is not true of us.<a name=135:9></a> If our individual history with God is not marked by faithfulness in the positions of trust in which we are placed, in our relationship as husband or wife, parent or child, master or servant; if the enemy can touch us in any of these, we shall not continue.<a name=135:10></a> Daniel's enemies searched into everything and they found

		I want to pursue the thought a little further with regard to Paul.<a name=136:7></a> What marked that beloved servant was that he also continued.<a name=136:8></a> He says, "Having therefore met with the help which is from God, I have stood firm unto this day".<a name=136:9></a> Did he have an easy path?<a name=136:10></a> Had he no tests?<a name=136:11></a> If any of us want to be humbled, just read the list of trials through which he continued.<a name=136:12></a> He started in a path from which he never went back.<a name=136:13></a> He says, "From the Jews five times have I received forty stripes save one.<a name=136:14></a> Thrice have I been scourged, once I have been stoned, three times I have suffered shipwreck, a night and day I passed in the deep .<a name=136:15></a>.<a name=136:16></a>.<a name=136:17></a> in perils of rivers, in perils of robbers, in perils from my own race, in perils from the nations .<a name=136:18></a>.<a name=136:19></a>.<a name=136:20></a> in perils among false brethren" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#11:24">2 Corinthians  11:24</a> - 26); but he steadily pursued his course, and what

		I trust the Lord may use these scriptures, dear brethren, to impart a sense of stability to our course.<a name=140:1></a> We see in them certain unassailable positions that the Lord has taken up.<a name=140:2></a> It is a great matter for us to understand that the stability of everything depends upon Christ and the place in which He is.<a name=140:3></a> I trust the Lord will help us, through these passages, to understand that He will see things through to finality in full accord with the pleasure and will of God.<a name=140:4></a>

		The first scripture we have read presents the Lord at the right hand of God.<a name=140:5></a> It speaks of the surpassing greatness of God's power "towards us who believe, according to the working of the might of his strength, in which he wrought in the Christ in raising him from among the dead, and he set him down at his right hand in the heavenlies".<a name=140:6></a>

		In <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2">Revelation  2</a>and 3, we see again that the Lord takes up various positions in relation to the seven assemblies.<a name=144:19></a> We have often been taught that the way in which the Lord appears to each assembly holds the key, we might say, to what is needed there.<a name=144:20></a>

		So the Lord says as to Ephesus, "To the angel of the assembly in Ephesus write: These things says he that holds the seven stars in his right hand".<a name=145:5></a> The seven stars refer to the angels of the seven assemblies and they are in His right hand.<a name=145:6></a> Each one is responsible to Him, but not only that, the Lord has them in His hand.<a name=145:7></a> What stability and security there is in the right hand of Christ!<a name=145:8></a> He holds them; nothing can go awry as we are held by His power, the right hand suggesting an infinite supply of divine resource and power.<a name=145:9></a>

		In the last assembly addressed, Laodicea, we find that the Lord takes up another position: He is standing outside the door.<a name=146:5></a> "Behold, I stand at the door and am knocking" (chapter 3:20).<a name=146:6></a> He is speaking to an assembly in a lukewarm state, and He is standing outside the door.<a name=146:7></a> Think of that!<a name=146:8></a> He had not got His place within; He stands outside, knocking: "if any one hear my voice and open the door" -- how gracious of the Lord!<a name=146:9></a> -- "I will come in unto him and sup with him, and he with me".<a name=146:10></a> The Lord would enter into our circumstances, and He loves to bring us over into His.<a name=146:11></a> What patience the Lord exercises as He stands at the door!<a name=146:12></a> He would cause each one of us to hear His voice so that we might open the door and prove His company and His provision.<a name=146:13></a>

		First, as to the work of faith .<a name=147:7></a>.<a name=147:8></a>.<a name=147:9></a> How does this work?<a name=147:10></a> Let us look at <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#17">Genesis  17</a>, verse I: "Jehovah appeared to Abram, and said to him, I am the Almighty God: walk before my face, and be perfect".<a name=147:11></a> This is the perfection of the pilgrim walk.<a name=147:12></a> If we have tasted grace we are in a position to walk before God and we see this come out in Abraham in chapter 24, verse 40, where he could say, "Jehovah, before whom I have walked".<a name=147:13></a> That is the work of faith.<a name=147:14></a> What a contrast we find in Jacob as he neared his end, after his life of plotting and scheming, seeking in unbelief to bring about God's promises by his own efforts!<a name=147:15></a> He could not speak thus of himself, though he could say, "The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God that shepherded me all my life long to this day" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#48:15">Genesis  48:15</a>).<a name=147:16></a> Think of this, for it is quite possible

		for us to miss this blessed path as he did.<a name=148:1></a> He was obliged to say, "Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#47:9">Genesis  47:9</a>).<a name=148:2></a> Why was this?<a name=148:3></a> It need not have been for at the outset God had revealed Himself to him in such a way that he might have walked before Him as did his fathers.<a name=148:4></a> The work of faith is that which keeps us in the presence of God and lets God come into everything connected with our path down here.<a name=148:5></a> Instead of this, how often we find that we walk before men, or even before our brethren, and that we prefer anything rather than to walk before God.<a name=148:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we come to another side of the work of faith (see <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#5:22">Genesis  5:22</a> - 24).<a name=148:7></a> "Enoch walked with God", and again, "Enoch walked with God; and he was not, for God took him".<a name=148:8></a> This is not the pilgrim life as Abraham's, but rather the life of privilege.<a name=148:9></a> The work of faith is to cultivate a life of divine privilege.<a name=148:10></a> Nothing could be more remarkable than that Enoch walked with God under the circumstances in which he lived.<a name=148:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we look at the line of Cain, the man of the world, we find the seventh from him was Lemech, in whose time the world began to be very attractive.<a name=148:12></a> The arts, amusements, manufactures and so on occupied man's mind, but God says, as it were, 'I will have a man superior to all that system of things, in whom I can find the work of faith'.<a name=148:13></a> So we find that (though death had come in by sin) only one man had as yet died, not an adequate witness to man's condition.<a name=148:14></a> But Enoch lived in a sphere that death

		could not touch.<a name=149:1></a> It is a most wonderful thing to find a man who so walked with God that he had faith to be translated (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:5">Hebrews  11:5</a>).<a name=149:2></a> He was the first man who tasted eternal life down here, and was superior to the world system around and to death as the judgment of God.<a name=149:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God does the same with us; He renders us superior to the world by putting us in the light, and we are so brought into the secret things of God that we enter into and enjoy things which death cannot touch.<a name=149:4></a> But for this I must first be right as to the pilgrim life; then comes the life of privilege.<a name=149:5></a> I am brought out of the scene of death into the scene of eternal life in His Son.<a name=149:6></a> How wonderful to find Enoch so in the enjoyment of these things that his translation was morally appropriate.<a name=149:7></a> He leaves the world and goes on walking with God.<a name=149:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle m writing to the Thessalonians beseeches them to walk so as to please God and to be superior to the world, so as to be in moral preparedness for being "caught up" like Enoch, as we get it in <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#4:17">1 Thessalonians  4:17</a>.<a name=149:9></a> Let us remember that the pilgrim life is before God, so that we may walk with God in the life of privilege until the Lord descends and we are translated and set down for ever in the presence of divine love.<a name=149:10></a> May we be exercised that we should be working out these things in faith.<a name=149:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Secondly we come to the "labour of love" (verse 3).<a name=149:12></a> The work of faith puts us right in relation to God and the labour of love puts us right in regard of our brethren, for it leads in the direction of holiness and

	<div class="paragraph">
		thus tends to unity.<a name=150:1></a> There is a moral order in Christianity which we should be very careful to observe.<a name=150:2></a> As we have seen, the work of faith comes before the labour of love.<a name=150:3></a> The latter, as we see in chapter 3, verse 13, is "in order to the confirming of your hearts unblamable in holiness before our God and Father", and mark, holiness is essential to unity.<a name=150:4></a> If I do not see this, I have not understood the great place that the unity of the saints has in the mind of God the Father and the Son.<a name=150:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>we hear the voice of divine love, and the burden of the chapter is that the saints may be kept from evil and sanctified through the truth in view of unity, "that they may be all one" (verse 21).<a name=150:6></a> The labour of love is to be on this line; we should be labouring in order to promote holiness with a view to unity.<a name=150:7></a> The want of holiness is the reason why there is so little unity.<a name=150:8></a> We cannot be too sensitive as to this -- just as a bit of grit in the eye hinders the normal action of the whole organ until it is removed, so we should be so walking in holiness and self-judgment that all should be set aside in us that hinders the flow of divine love.<a name=150:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Why are not all Christians walking in unity here in Bath?<a name=150:10></a> For want of holiness.<a name=150:11></a> We should be so in the energy of divine love that everything should go that is not of Christ or of God.<a name=150:12></a> If all were willing as to this there would very soon be the christian company walking in unity.<a name=150:13></a> It must be so, for nothing else would be left but a perfectly lovely company, the body of Christ.<a name=150:14></a>

		Now we come to the third point, namely, the "constancy of hope".<a name=152:5></a> If we are right with God through the work of faith, and with our brethren through the labour of love, we are morally prepared and free to look up in the "constancy of hope", because we know what God has treasured up in Christ, the joy and blessing He has up there, ready to burst forth and illuminate the entire universe.<a name=152:6></a> We find often a great difference between many of the saints nowadays and these Thessalonian saints.<a name=152:7></a> The Christian is now more often occupied with the thought 'I am going there' than with the thought of the glory that is coming from there.<a name=152:8></a> The constancy of hope would correct all this and keep one looking up in expectancy of all that is coming out and thus separate from the world, the whole system of things down here, which is all about to be done away.<a name=152:9></a>

		It is a moment of no small interest when a believer first awakes to the fact that he is linked with every other Christian by an indissoluble bond, and that all believers together form one company.<a name=153:21></a> When we are

		converted we feel by a kind of spiritual instinct that we are so linked.<a name=154:1></a> We feel that our interests are the same; we all know the same Saviour, and, in our measure, all love Him because He first loved us.<a name=154:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But although this is the case, and should increasingly continue to be so, yet it is quite a further and a confirming thing to know by divine authority that such a bond really exists, and does not consist merely in having sentiments in common.<a name=154:3></a> The feelings proceed from a fact; the sentiments are the outcome of a cause.<a name=154:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Holy Spirit of God has formed the link and is the source of the feelings which Christians rightly have in common one with another.<a name=154:5></a> The Holy Spirit has formed this one company.<a name=154:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is our desire in this and subsequent papers, if God permit, to consider the subject of this remark- able association and to inquire what it is in itself and what are its characteristics.<a name=154:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may look a little, first of all, at the <i>formation</i> of this company.<a name=154:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		During His ministry on earth the Lord gathered round Him disciples, and we shall recall that, after His death and resurrection, He gave them instructions to tarry in Jerusalem till they should be baptised with the Holy Spirit whom He had promised to send (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:4">Acts  1:4</a>, 5).<a name=154:9></a> Shortly after this about one hundred and twenty disciples were together, and it was then that the Holy Spirit descended from heaven and formed this unique company, which is called in scripture the <i>church of God</i>.<a name=154:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=155>[Page 155]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Until then the disciples were but so many individuals, held together, surely, by the presence of Christ, and after His death by a common interest in their then rejected Master.<a name=155:1></a> But by the coming of the Holy Spirit, consequent upon Jesus being glorified (<a href="../bible/John.htm#7:39">John  7:39</a>), they were baptised by one Spirit into one body and were one company.<a name=155:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was not till later that the truth relating to the presence of the Spirit was made known; but the church of God was formed then, and believers were constituted one body through the coming of the Holy Spirit (see <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:13">1 Corinthians  12:13</a>).<a name=155:3></a> Hence we read in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:47">Acts  2:47</a> (A V), "the Lord added to the <i>church</i> daily .<a name=155:4></a>.<a name=155:5></a>.<a name=155:6></a>"
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The doctrine of this, as we have said, was revealed later.<a name=155:7></a> The apostle Paul was specially en- trusted with this ministry, and in his first epistle to the Corinthians he formally states it, and develops the truth relating to the presence and operations of the Spirit of God.<a name=155:8></a> In chapter 12 we read, "For also in the power of one Spirit <i>we</i> have all been baptised into one body" (verse 13).<a name=155:9></a> It does not say <i>when</i> this took place, but merely states the fact.<a name=155:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We shall be impressed at the outset, therefore, with the fact that the church of God is neither a voluntary nor a human association, but was formed by a divine Person -- the Holy Spirit -- indwelling each individual Christian and baptising all into one body.<a name=155:11></a> If the church of God were a voluntary association, that is, one formed by Christians purely at their own desire or will, it would be optional to us whether we should form part of it or not.<a name=155:12></a> It would be
	</div>

		<a name=156>[Page 156]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		the outcome of the will of man, however well intended.<a name=156:1></a> And again, a human association could only rise to the level of man, and would be regulated by human ideas and governed by human expedients.<a name=156:2></a> But the church of God is neither.<a name=156:3></a> And, we may add, if we are believers, we form part of this company, not by our own act, but by God's.<a name=156:4></a> Hence a believer cannot ignore his relation to other Christians, inasmuch as he is linked by divine will with every person who has received the Spirit of God and who thus is one of this august assembly -- the church of God.<a name=156:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:18">Matthew  16:18</a> the Lord referred to this company, and there it is we find the definite statement that He would build His church.<a name=156:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was evidently, therefore, something entirely <i>new</i> when the Lord uttered these words.<a name=156:7></a> There had been individuals from the beginning who had been marked by faith, as we learn from <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11">Hebrews  11</a>.<a name=156:8></a> There had been God's earthly people Israel, but the church of God was something new and distinct.<a name=156:9></a> It was formed by the coming of the Holy Spirit consequent upon Jesus being glorified.<a name=156:10></a> What a remarkable company, or assembly, this must be!<a name=156:11></a> The gates of hell are powerless and cannot prevail against it.<a name=156:12></a> It is a company on earth, built by Christ, actually formed by the coming of the Holy Spirit from Christ in glory, and comprises every person who has received the gift of the Spirit.<a name=156:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may note in the earlier chapters of the Acts of the Apostles how the church gradually emerges

		from Judaism; that is, from the Jewish system of earthly religion, and from Jerusalem, in which and where it was found at its formation (that is, found as to its actual circumstances, for it never formed part of Judaism).<a name=157:1></a> No earthly centre could be recognised, for it lay in the Spirit of God, who was gathering universally to Christ.<a name=157:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may trace how the bounds and limits of Jewish distinction were burst, and we recall Antioch as well as other places, and eventually Ephesus, as scenes of the Spirit's operations on earth.<a name=157:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The means God is pleased to use for the further formation, or extension, of the church we find alluded to in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:6">Ephesians  3:6</a>.<a name=157:4></a> We shall quote the verse: "That the Gentiles should be fellow-heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by <i>the gospel</i>" (A V).<a name=157:5></a> Thus the two subjects, the "church" and the "gospel", are most intimately linked together.<a name=157:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have frequently heard, alas!<a name=157:7></a> the one side of truth pressed to the exclusion of the other, but scripturally regarded they cannot be separated.<a name=157:8></a> (See also <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#16:25">Romans  16:25</a>).<a name=157:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Of course we refer to the formation of the church of God on earth and its existence here.<a name=157:10></a> It was first so actually formed by the coming of the Holy Spirit, and, from that day to this, those who believe the gospel, and receive the gift of the Spirit, are brought into that company.<a name=157:11></a> There is no such thing in scripture as 'joining a church' nor of joining the church of God, except by believing the gospel and

		But we have the <i>subject</i> of their conversation also -- it was His decease -- a theme most worthy to engage the glorified hosts.<a name=188:1></a> We may well speak of it on every Lord's day, in the light of the <i>resurrection</i>, since the ransomed in the heavens speak of it in the light of <i>glory</i>.<a name=188:2></a> For it is that great fact or mystery that will be celebrated for ever, as it is the great fact that is to prove itself the pillars of eternity, the pillars of the creation of God.<a name=188:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And again, they will let us learn a very weighty matter connected with this subject -- it was a decease that was to be <i>accomplished</i> -- a word which suggests the full, finished, perfected character of the way in which that great mystery, the death of the Lamb of God at Jerusalem, was to be conducted.<a name=188:4></a> All due solemnity was to mark it, that nothing might be left unaffected, unproduced, or unsecured, which it was counselled to do.<a name=188:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And what a comfort to us sinners!<a name=188:6></a> The sacrifice of the Lamb of God was the precious eternal secret that was to give us blessed eternal peace; and we have to learn that all that was committed to it to do, it has done -- the counsels, the throne, the weights and measures of the sanctuary of salvation, all have been satisfied to the last jot and tittle.<a name=188:7></a>

		Then, arrayed with his proper priestly garments of glory and beauty, <i>he offers a burnt-offering</i> for himself, and another for the people; a witness that all this great and gracious work had issued in the worship and praise which was thus rendered to Him, by the ransomed, the blood-purchased congregation of the Lord.<a name=189:9></a> And then, he puts <i>the fat</i> of the

	<div class="paragraph">
		The sin-offerings, both bullock and goat, were then <i>entirely consumed</i> "without the camp" -- and the fit man who had taken away the scape-goat, and the other who had now thus consumed the sin- offerings, carefully purify themselves, and then take their place in the camp again.<a name=190:2></a>

		It should be clear to all who have some knowledge of God that there is very great interest between heaven and earth.<a name=193:1></a> In Deuteronomy it is said, "Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens belong to Jehovah thy God; the earth and all that is therein".<a name=193:2></a> So it is evident that both the heavens and the earth are divine property.<a name=193:3></a> God as Creator has formed them all.<a name=193:4></a> Though we cannot compass the immensity of the heavens, they are not sufficiently great to contain God: "the heavens and the heaven of heavens cannot contain him" (<a href="../bible/2Chronicles.htm#2:6">2 Chronicles  2:6</a>).<a name=193:5></a> His majesty extends beyond the heavens.<a name=193:6></a> The power of God is known there, and witnessed to by them.<a name=193:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Sadly, at the present time there is a great difference between what prevails on the earth and what exists in heaven.<a name=193:8></a> That is not according to the mind of God, and He will not be satisfied until that situation is put right.<a name=193:9></a> We can anticipate the resolving of it on account of the work of reconciliation carried out by the Lord Jesus.<a name=193:10></a> Not only has He established reconciliation in view of persons being reconciled to God, but He has effected that work in view of the reconciliation of all things.<a name=193:11></a> That is, everything is to be brought into accord with the mind of God.<a name=193:12></a>

		The passage in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#10">Deuteronomy  10</a>brings out that God had acted sovereignly in taking up a people on earth.<a name=194:4></a> Heaven suggests God's dwelling place, but in exercising His sovereign will in mercy it had pleased Him to take up a nation on the earth and to bless them.<a name=194:5></a> He had delivered them out of bondage in Egypt, and was about to bring them into a land that He had espied for them, according to all the goodness that was in His heart.<a name=194:6></a> These were actions from God's side and His people were exhorted not to forget about these things.<a name=194:7></a> Moses spoke to the people many times that they should not forget the way they were delivered from Egypt and brought into the land of divine favour.<a name=194:8></a> We ought not to forget the great mercy of God, who has acted sovereignly in extending mercy to many of us.<a name=194:9></a> May we all be able to say that, as having had to do with God.<a name=194:10></a>

		God was also concerned that His people should not only be the recipients of His favour and blessing from heaven, but that they should act like Himself.<a name=195:3></a> If He had acted towards them in blessing, and was their God, then just as He had been merciful to them, so they are exhorted to love the stranger.<a name=195:4></a> "And ye shall love the stranger; for ye have been strangers in the land of Egypt".<a name=195:5></a> They had to fear God, act like God and serve God.<a name=195:6></a> It shows how the influence of heaven had to have its effect in the hearts of God's people here.<a name=195:7></a>

		I believe, dear brethren, the history of Samuel presents certain spiritual elements which are essential in any locality for the prosperity of the testimony there, and shows how they may develop from small beginnings.<a name=203:11></a> The elements that I refer to are, firstly, what is priestly; then secondly, the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=204>[Page 204]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		prophetic word; thirdly, power with God in prayer and calling on His Name; fourthly, the element of spiritual judgment; and then finally the power to bring Christ in so that He acquires the place among God's people that He should have.<a name=204:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think we can see that all these elements are of great value in any locality, and there is no reason why they should not be present, for the days in which Samuel is introduced were about as bad as they could be.<a name=204:2></a> Indeed, they are referred to at the end of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#78">Psalm  78</a>in terms that show that the conditions among God's people had at that time become as bad as they could be, but they afforded the background for God to intervene in His sovereignty to bring in David, and through him to establish all His thoughts concerning His people.<a name=204:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then, before God brought in David, there was this previous history having its rise in the exercises of a godly woman named Hannah.<a name=204:4></a> There is no reason why the spirit of Hannah should not be with us, for the conditions publicly in Christendom are morally the same as the conditions that obtained in Israel in Hannah's day.<a name=204:5></a> That is, that which claims publicly to be in the position of the priesthood is corrupt, and so much evil and corruption of every kind are now connected with what claims to be divine service that it is nauseous to Him, so that the Lord's word to Laodicea is, "I am about to spue thee out of my mouth" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:16">Revelation  3:16</a>) -- a very strong expression, showing how the Lord regards the state of indifference to what is due to Himself and His
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=205>[Page 205]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Name that marks the christian profession at the present time.<a name=205:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But it was in the presence of such conditions that Hannah had her exercises, her husband apparently satisfied to go on with what was formal; the yearly sacrifice was quite sufficient for him, so that he could hardly understand Hannah's exercise that she could be content with nothing less than a son.<a name=205:2></a> What God has in mind for His saints is that they should move before Him and serve Him in the character of sons, and Hannah desired a son.<a name=205:3></a> Elkanah said to Hannah, "Am not I better to thee than ten sons?<a name=205:4></a>" (<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#1:8">1 Samuel  1:8</a>), but Hannah pursued her exercise and in due course God gave her the son that she had asked for, and he was named Samuel, which means, 'Asked for of God' (footnote <i>c</i>).<a name=205:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this is a most important matter for us to bear in mind, beloved brethren, and it is always open to us to ask of God.<a name=205:6></a> Samuel represents what is brought in on the basis of asking of God, so that whatever needs may disclose themselves in a locality, whatever falling short there may be in the actual answer to the truth, there is always open to us this avenue of asking of God.<a name=205:7></a> God loves to give in answer to requests, as the Lord said, "how much rather shall the Father who is of heaven give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?<a name=205:8></a>" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#11:13">Luke  11:13</a>).<a name=205:9></a> Hence Samuel represents what is brought in on the principle of one exercised soul having asked of God, having had discernment of conditions, and intelligence of what was needed to meet those

	<div class="paragraph">
		conditions.<a name=206:1></a> It says of Samuel that he ministered before Jehovah being a boy girded with a linen ephod; that is, he morally displaced the priesthood that was so corrupt.<a name=206:2></a> Officially he was not a priest, for though a Levite he was not of the house of Aaron, but morally he was one.<a name=206:3></a> He ministered before Jehovah girded with a linen ephod.<a name=206:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is the first thing to be considered in any locality: what is priestly, what will minister to the pleasure of God, not doing it in a merely formal way, but as having the moral conditions that the service of God requires, because it says that Samuel was girded with an ephod of linen.<a name=206:5></a> That represents that the moral conditions suitable to the priesthood were found with Samuel, even though at this time he was but a boy.<a name=206:6></a> That is what God looks for in His people; it was being developed, though in but small measure as yet, and God could now set aside the official priesthood that was so corrupt and distasteful to Him.<a name=206:7></a> I believe it is always God's way that, if He is going to set some thing aside, He has already there in existence what is qualified to replace it.<a name=206:8></a> So you remember when the disciples spoke to the Lord about the temple and called His attention to the fine buildings, He told them, "not a stone shall be left upon a stone, which shall not be thrown down" (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#13:2">Mark  13:2</a>).<a name=206:9></a> The Lord had there the widow who had cast in her two mites into the treasury, and therefore that which was only formal could be set aside; what was pleasing to God and devoted to His service was already there in the person of the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=207>[Page 207]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		widow.<a name=207:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is always a principle with God, and I would urge upon the young brothers and sisters to start young in considering what is pleasing to God so as to develop in what is priestly.<a name=207:2></a> We can only develop what is priestly by being in the presence of God and being attentive to the Holy Spirit.<a name=207:3></a> It is only thus that we shall develop in what is priestly, but that is what counts above everything else in His testimony, and everything that is pleasing to God develops out of what is priestly.<a name=207:4></a> What Samuel was as a great prophet, what he was as a great intercessor and one who had power with God as calling on His Name, and what he was as a great judge, all flow out of his beginnings in priestly activities.<a name=207:5></a> He was not a priest officially but he was one morally, and it is exactly the same today with the saints of God who give place to the Spirit of God; they are characteristically priestly, and displace all that is formal and official in the priesthood around us.<a name=207:6></a> God passes over all that, and will shortly set it aside completely, because He already has in its place that which pleases Him.<a name=207:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So it says that Samuel's mother made him a little coat and brought it to him from year to year.<a name=207:8></a> How important this maternal element is in any company, the element that, as having already considered for God, will watch the growth of that which is young in the company.<a name=207:9></a> The suggestion is that there was normal gradual growth, and each year a fresh coat was needed, and it was the mother that brought it.<a name=207:10></a> It is most important that there should be this maternal

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		watchfulness as to the spiritual growth of those who are younger, that there may be a steady development of what is priestly in the local company, because, I say again, what is priestly underlies everything else.<a name=208:1></a> There can he no power in the prophetic word, or with God in intercession, or in the spirit of judgment -- there can he no power in any of these directions, save as it finds its roots in what is priestly.<a name=208:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#3">1 Samuel  3</a>we find that it says, "the boy Samuel ministered to Jehovah before Eli".<a name=208:3></a> It is very interesting to notice how the Spirit of God presents Samuel in contrast to what was around.<a name=208:4></a> In chapter 2: 11 it says, "And the boy ministered to Jehovah in the presence of Eli the priest".<a name=208:5></a> And then we have a section which describes the evil and utter wicked-ness of the official priesthood.<a name=208:6></a> In verse 18 it says, "And Samuel ministered before Jehovah, a boy girded with a linen ephod", and in verses 22 and onwards we get the incapacity of Eli, his oldness and his lack of moral power, so that while he reproves his sons, he has no power with them.<a name=208:7></a> In verse 26 it says, "Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with Jehovah and also with men".<a name=208:8></a> Then we get in the final section in that chapter the man of God coming to Eli and conveying to him God's judgment of his house.<a name=208:9></a> Chapter 3: 1 reads, "the boy Samuel ministered to Jehovah", that is, the Spirit of God is continually reverting to Samuel in contrast to all that is around, which is so displeasing and abhorrent to God.<a name=208:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 3 the Lord honours Samuel and calls
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=209>[Page 209]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		him by name, saying, "Samuel, Samuel!<a name=209:1></a>" Samuel was slow to understand who it was speaking to him, but eventually he says.<a name=209:2></a> "Speak, for thy servant heareth".<a name=209:3></a> It says, "Jehovah came, and stood, and called as at the other times, Samuel, Samuel!<a name=209:4></a>" That is, Jehovah is now definitely taking account of what was there.<a name=209:5></a> I am seeking to apply this to the conditions that may obtain in our localities, because as the truth that God has ministered among us is responded to by us, there is that which provides a full answer to Him notwithstanding the corrupt state of things around us.<a name=209:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So God is honouring Samuel.<a name=209:7></a> Jehovah came and stood, and <i>stood</i> means took up His stand deliberately.<a name=209:8></a> He was standing in relation to Samuel.<a name=209:9></a> Judgment had already been pronounced on the system around, and Jehovah was taking His stand in relation to Samuel: was Samuel going to fail Him or not?<a name=209:10></a> That is the position now; the Lord has passed by that which is around us and has taken His stand in relation to what God has brought in vitally, though in smallness.<a name=209:11></a> The point is, are we going to fail Him, or are we going to answer fully to all that He looks for?<a name=209:12></a> He knows Samuel and calls him by name.<a name=209:13></a> He would give Samuel to know that He knows him by name, and Samuel says, "Speak, for thy servant heareth", and then Jehovah says a most remarkable thing to Samuel.<a name=209:14></a> We do not know exactly what Samuel's age was at that time, but he was sufficiently young to be called a boy, and Jehovah tells him what He was about to do in Israel, a thing,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=210>[Page 210]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle".<a name=210:1></a> That is, the Lord does not hesitate to say to the boy that the conditions around him, in the midst of which he was, were so bad that He was coming in in the most drastic judgment.<a name=210:2></a> He would have the boy understand all this.<a name=210:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So it is important for the young to face these things; it is a question of understanding what the privilege of our position is, that through grace we are found in separation from evil around, and in a place where the truth is known; and the question is, What are we going to do with it?<a name=210:4></a> Are we going to see that the conditions provided are maintained so that the service of God can go on to the end?<a name=210:5></a> The Lord did not hesitate to tell Samuel what He felt about these things, and about Eli, and Eli's house; the whole matter was laid out before Samuel.<a name=210:6></a> We can understand why Samuel would fear Jehovah.<a name=210:7></a> We can understand how it would promote the spirit of fear in his heart, as he found himself in the presence of Jehovah who spoke to him of doing such a thing in Israel.<a name=210:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Jehovah was not sparing Samuel, so to speak; He was making him feel the seriousness of having to do with God, for there is to be no trifling with the holiness of God.<a name=210:9></a> With a sense of that, Samuel is to speak with spiritual power.<a name=210:10></a> It is a question of God, His house and His service, and the holiness that becomes it, and Samuel is to understand that God will maintain the holiness proper to His house.<a name=210:11></a> So Eli calls upon Samuel in the morning to tell him
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=211>[Page 211]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		what Jehovah had said.<a name=211:1></a> Eli says, "I pray thee, keep it not back from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou keep back anything from me of all the word that he spoke to thee".<a name=211:2></a> And it says, "Samuel told him all the words, and kept nothing back from him".<a name=211:3></a> Samuel was faithful.<a name=211:4></a> In <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#23:28">Jeremiah  23:28</a> we read, "he that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully".<a name=211:5></a> I believe it was this faithfulness on Samuel's part in telling Eli exactly what Jehovah had said, although extremely painful and difficult to do, that established him as a prophet of Jehovah.<a name=211:6></a> He would say, Now I have one I can rely on, someone who will not water down My word to make it popular, someone who will convey My word faithfully.<a name=211:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And it says, "Samuel grew" (chapter 3: 19).<a name=211:8></a> How encouraging all these statements are in the early chapters, the Spirit of God taking account of the growth that was going on, starting with what was small.<a name=211:9></a> The Spirit of God watched it and recorded it as it grew in priestliness and faithfulness in regard to the word of Jehovah.<a name=211:10></a> There was at any rate <i>someone</i> in Israel who would pay attention to what He said.<a name=211:11></a> "Jehovah was with him, and let none of his words fall to the ground.<a name=211:12></a> And all Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, knew that Samuel was established a prophet of Jehovah".<a name=211:13></a> So he is established a prophet, but what underlies it is priestliness, ministering to the Lord clothed with the linen ephod.<a name=211:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What is needed is the prophetic word.<a name=211:15></a> It says in the prophet Hosea, "by a prophet Jehovah brought

	<div class="paragraph">
		Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved" (chapter 12: 13).<a name=212:1></a> The prophetic word is intended to deliver the saints from the world, and to preserve them as they pass through the wilderness identified with the service and testimony of God; hence it is always needed, so the epistle to the Corinthians encourages us to desire the ability to prophesy (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14:1">1 Corinthians  14:1</a> - 5).<a name=212:2></a> We have to see to it that we are following after love, and then we may desire earnestly the best gifts.<a name=212:3></a>

		All our desires for ability to prophesy should be prompted by desire to see the saints prosper and to promote the pleasure of God in His people.<a name=212:4></a> If that is the basis of our desires, we may desire earnestly that we may prophesy.<a name=212:5></a> It is a question of bringing in what is needed, and so we get instruction as to the gift of prophecy, and one may mention at this point, how Isaiah in the 6th chapter tells us of his own conversion, and how one of the seraphim flew to him with a live coal taken with tongs from off the altar, and touched his lips, and said, "Behold, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin expiated" (verse 7); and then Isaiah heard a voice saying, "Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?<a name=212:6></a>" (verse 8).<a name=212:7></a> That is, someone is needed.<a name=212:8></a> Let us bear that in mind; someone is needed to convey the mind of God.<a name=212:9></a> It is a means by which the people of God are preserved.<a name=212:10></a> Isaiah says, "Here am I; <i>send</i> me".<a name=212:11></a> The idea of being sent is that you have a message.<a name=212:12></a> So Samuel starts his history as a prophet by having a message, and telling it faithfully.<a name=212:13></a> It is

		Now Scripture shows that sisters also may prophesy, and that they may have their part in conveying the mind of God.<a name=213:3></a> That is a feature that showed itself in the early days, it was there in Anna, it was there in the daughters of Philip, but we do not often see it now.<a name=213:4></a> It may be a question for sisters as to whether there is something lacking in this respect, whether that feature which ought to be found among the people of God is lacking, because evidently it has a place.<a name=213:5></a> Sisters may exercise an influence in the way in which they may convey the mind of God as having received it themselves, and as being marked by moral power as those who have to do with God.<a name=213:6></a> So this element of prophesying was found with Samuel, and it says that "Jehovah revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of Jehovah".<a name=213:7></a>

		So we have read these four well-known passages: firstly, of the Lord singing the Father's praises in the midst of the assembly; then of the redemption song sung by Moses and the children of Israel after they had crossed the Red Sea; then of those singing and dancing women, who came out to meet king Saul, and who said, "Saul hath smitten his thousands, and David his ten thousands"; and then of Paul and Silas in prison, yet singing to God.<a name=226:1></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>the Lord, as in resurrection, says, "I will declare thy name to my brethren".<a name=226:2></a> On the resurrection morn, the Lord Jesus told Mary to "go to my brethren" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#20:17">John  20:17</a>).<a name=226:3></a> "My brethren" -- how the Lord must have delighted to use that blessed appellation of His disciples.<a name=226:4></a> They had companied with Him through the three and a half years of His sojourn here, but now, through His death and resurrection, one order of man had been closed up before God, and a new order introduced.<a name=226:5></a> So, the Lord could associate His disciples with Himself as "my brethren"!<a name=226:6></a> Does that not stir our affections for Him?<a name=226:7></a> Think of that glorious One, risen out of death, walking upon this very earth again, about to go up on high, not just to receive the honour and glory of the Father, but as leading the way in which His own are to follow: "I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#20:17">John  20:17</a>).<a name=226:8></a>

		Now this passage in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#15">Exodus  15</a>is often referred to as the first instance of singing in the Scriptures.<a name=227:10></a> Of course, we have that interesting passage, "When the morning stars sang together" (<a href="../bible/Job.htm#38:7">Job  38:7</a>), a beautiful suggestion of the heavenly host being appreciative of what God was doing when He created the heavens and the earth.<a name=227:11></a> But here we have the first occasion of men singing -- a redeemed people have much to sing about!<a name=227:12></a> The children of Israel had just come out of Egypt, having passed through the Red Sea.<a name=227:13></a> What a deliverance God wrought for His people!<a name=227:14></a>

		In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#99">Psalm  99</a>he is mentioned also, "Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name" (verse 6); so it is open to us to develop power with God.<a name=234:9></a> How valuable this can be in any local company: power to be able to call upon God, and to get an answer from God.<a name=234:10></a> We get other instances in Scripture of God taking account of what individuals are.<a name=234:11></a> He says, "Shall I hide from Abraham what I am doing?<a name=234:12></a>" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#18:17">Genesis  18:17</a>).<a name=234:13></a> He was taking account of Abraham, and what Abraham was as walking with Him, and as pleasing to Him.<a name=234:14></a> "I know him", he says, "that he will command his children

		Then in the end of the chapter Samuel comes before us as marked by spiritual judgment, a most important feature in the assembly.<a name=235:7></a> We are to judge angels and the world, and in view of our judging the world, God allows all sorts of matters to arise in the history of the assembly; they arise in localities, and have to be dealt in localities according to the spirit of judgment, that is, right judgment.<a name=235:8></a> "Judge not according to sight, but righteous judgment" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#7:24">John  7:24</a>).<a name=235:9></a> First of all, before any judgment is pronounced on a matter, the correct facts have to be carefully ascertained and thorough inquiry made, as we see in <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#13:14">Deuteronomy  13:14</a> and <a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#17:4">Deuteronomy  17:4</a>; then it is a question of bringing to bear upon these facts principles that are according to God.<a name=235:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So Samuel went from year to year and judged Israel.<a name=236:5></a> He went to Gilgal; this place suggests the cutting off of the flesh, what God has effected in the death of Christ, and what we are to maintain in the power of the Spirit; Samuel would bring that to bear on matters as they arose.<a name=236:6></a> How drastically God has dealt with the flesh in the cross of Christ, and the Spirit of God has come in in order that we may be maintained in what has been done for us!<a name=236:7></a> So Samuel would bring Gilgal to bear upon matters that arise.<a name=236:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then he judged also in Mizpah.<a name=236:9></a> The meaning of Mizpah is 'Witness', and in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#31">Genesis  31</a>Laban says, "when we shall be hidden one from another .<a name=236:10></a>.<a name=236:11></a>.<a name=236:12></a> no man is with us; see, God is witness between me and thee!<a name=236:13></a>" (verses 49, 50).<a name=236:14></a> Mizpah brings that side of the truth before us: God is looking on, that even when we are by ourselves, God is witness.<a name=236:15></a> If, at your leisure, you turn to <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#31:45">Genesis  31:45</a> - 50, where the

		Then, finally, it says, "his return was to Ramah; for there was his house, and there he judged Israel; and there he built an altar to Jehovah".<a name=237:3></a> That was the place where he maintained his personal links with God.<a name=237:4></a> It represents one of the elements of our maintenance, our personal links with God -- a most important matter -- and that also becomes the means of judging things that arise.<a name=237:5></a> If we cultivate personal links with God, we shall develop the power of spiritual judgment.<a name=237:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 16, I think Samuel represents another element.<a name=237:7></a> I do not go into the detail of that chapter, but it is particularly occupied with a locality, that is, Bethlehem.<a name=237:8></a> It is in view of conditions pleasing to God being found in Bethlehem.<a name=237:9></a> Saul (that is, the first man at his best) had been rejected by God, and, speaking typically, the point is that Christ is to take his place.<a name=237:10></a> David was to be anointed, the man of God's choice; that is, to put it simply, the first man is not to be in evidence in our locality.<a name=237:11></a> Christ is to be everything and in all.<a name=237:12></a> That is what God has in mind, and that is what we should have in mind; we may say we are a long way from it, but let us keep the divine thought before us.<a name=237:13></a> Paul will admit nothing short of the divine standard in his labours.<a name=237:14></a> He says that he laboured to present "every man perfect in Christ" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:28">Colossians  1:28</a>).<a name=237:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The idea of sacrifice to Jehovah was to be set before the elders of Bethlehem.<a name=238:13></a> Every true believer would respond to the idea of considering for God, and providing conditions pleasing to God in his locality, and so Samuel was to come to Bethlehem with the object of providing conditions that were pleasing to God, that which God could take pleasure in, and all were to be drawn into it.<a name=238:14></a> Samuel would bring the elders in too, and Jesse and his sons; all were to be drawn into this matter of considering for God with just one object in view, that conditions pleasing to God should be brought in.<a name=238:15></a> That necessitates

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One has often referred in this connection to the way Paul moved in relation to the Corinthians, bringing in the commandment of the Lord to correct the conditions that were there, but also sending Timothy, who, he said, "shall put you in mind of my ways as they are in Christ, according as I teach everywhere in every assembly" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#4:17">1 Corinthians  4:17</a>).<a name=239:5></a> There was not only an authoritative message, but there was the idea of the exemplification of the ministry, by means of which they would be brought to the remembrance of Paul's ways as they were in Christ, as he taught everywhere in every assembly.<a name=239:6></a> The Spirit of God will always support what is of Christ, as expressed livingly in a place.<a name=239:7></a>

		The two disciples were greatly affected by the presentation to them of the Lamb of God.<a name=254:2></a> They left everything to follow Him.<a name=254:3></a> John the Baptist was a great servant of God, but his ministry was in connection with the present order of things, in connection with an order of things where sin was.<a name=254:4></a> There was no solution of the question of sin, and therefore no full revelation of God presented in connection with John the Baptist.<a name=254:5></a> But the "Lamb of God" was One who could solve the whole question of sin, and remove that question out of the way altogether, so as to be able to lead men into an entirely new order of things, where everything should be characterised by the knowledge of God according to the blessedness of the revelation in which He has come out in His only-begotten Son.<a name=254:6></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Matthew records the Lord's commission.<a name=266:3></a> Certain ones were commissioned and given authority to make disciples of all nations, baptising them to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.<a name=266:4></a> The commissioners of Christ were not to be at all preferential in their service for <i>all</i> nations were to be in view, and, if we are to <i>make</i> disciples of them, it implies not only great power, but great ability to set out the <i>gain</i> accruing from the acceptance of the gospel.<a name=266:5></a> The believers were to be introduced into the realm of light; they were to be baptised to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.<a name=266:6></a> The advantages were enormous, and the servants of Christ were to make clear what these advantages were, and that they really did exist.<a name=266:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Mark, the advantage is to the <i>believer</i>; emphasis is laid on believing.<a name=266:8></a> The preachers were themselves to be believers.<a name=266:9></a> They were told to go not to all nations, but to "all the world" and preach to "all the creation".<a name=266:10></a> Such, in the mind of God, is the width of the area in which the gospel is to be announced; and, as believers, the preachers were to impress their hearers with the importance of believing, saying, "He that believes and is baptised, shall be saved" (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#16:16">Mark  16:16</a>).<a name=266:11></a> Certain signs should

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then Luke leaves us with a company of people who themselves were the very expression of the thing that the gospel proposed.<a name=267:3></a> They were not mere theorists, they were persons who had been blessed, and, as believers on the Lord Jesus, they were full of joy, they were happy people, their countenances betokened that they were the possessors of blessing, and that they had something positive from God.<a name=267:4></a> They were full of joy and were continually in the temple, we read, praising and blessing God.<a name=267:5></a> So that in Luke we have witnesses; that is what he would call attention to, as we read in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#3:4">Acts  3:4</a>, 5, Peter and John said, "Look on us": they were the expression of the thing that they preached.<a name=267:6></a> That is Luke.<a name=267:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Lastly, John in his record leaves us with a company of people who had the <i>Spirit of Christ</i>, examples of the kind of men that the gospel produces; not vindictive men, not persecutors, but persons imbued with the Spirit of Christ.<a name=267:8></a> He breathed into them, having said, "as the Father sent me forth, I also send you".<a name=267:9></a> They are not called apostles; they are simply disciples, breathed into by Christ, and sent out as He was sent of the Father.<a name=267:10></a> They were to be the representatives of Him in the Spirit in which they carried on their service, so that He tells them, "whose soever sins ye remit, they are

	<div class="paragraph">
		As understanding thus the four evangelists, we can see how effective the gospel was.<a name=268:3></a> There was power; there was faith; and there was a concrete representation of the product of the gospel in Luke; and then the spirit of forgiveness marks those who were sent out according to John.<a name=268:4></a> So that it is in the spirit of the four evangelists that we should approach this great service of preaching the glad tidings, to make it attractive to you.<a name=268:5></a> If there is an unbeliever here, one would like to make it clear to you that there is immense gain in becoming a believer.<a name=268:6></a> There is not only great danger in remaining an unbeliever, but there is immense present and eternal gain in becoming a believer.<a name=268:7></a> Having said all that so that you may understand that I am not simply preaching from the Old Testament, I shall seek to present the gospel as illustrated in this chapter.<a name=268:8></a> There are three thrones spoken of in it; one is Ahab's, one is Jehoshaphat's, and the other is God's.<a name=268:9></a> It is a remarkable chapter.<a name=268:10></a>

		It is not a little remarkable that what is peculiar to the church of God was not revealed to believers at the outset.<a name=281:12></a> In the early chapters of Acts we find no allusion, much less any teaching, relating to the body of Christ.<a name=281:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As we remarked in a previous paper, this truth was communicated by special revelation to the apostle Paul, and the first intimation we have of it is in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9">Acts  9</a>, when the Lord arrests Saul of Tarsus in his mad career of persecution, with the words, "Saul, Saul, why dost thou persecute me?<a name=281:14></a>" (verse 4).<a name=281:15></a>
	</div>

		was not <i>formed</i> till then.<a name=282:1></a> It was formed by the coming of the Holy Spirit (as we read in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>), but in the ways of God there was a development of the truth.<a name=282:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Things overlapped.<a name=282:3></a> There was the offer of the return of Christ to Israel (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#3:20">Acts  3:20</a>), and promises of earthly blessing would have been then fulfilled had they nationally repented of their act of crucifying the Lord.<a name=282:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But far otherwise was the case, and the stoning of Stephen was the evidence of the ratification of their sin.<a name=282:5></a> They sent a messenger, as it were, saying, "We will not that this man should reign over us" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#19:14">Luke  19:14</a>).<a name=282:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence the distinctive teaching relating to the church (which occupies the place of Israel, as the "people of God") was not brought out till the fitting moment.<a name=282:7></a> But when Israel confirmed their rejection of Christ, by the stoning of Stephen, then it was that God called this special vessel, Paul, to make known the "mystery".<a name=282:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		(1) There is the complete and full idea as presented in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:22">Ephesians  1:22</a>, 23: "the assembly, which is his body, the fulness of him who fills all in all".<a name=282:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Undoubtedly the view here embraces every believer from Pentecost to the coming of Christ.<a name=282:10></a> The church is seen as the fulness of Christ, and as associated with Him in His position, as set far above

		It is interesting to recall that the first type of the church is that of Eve, and was given before sin entered the world, and hence illustrates the fact that the church was the subject of God's eternal counsel.<a name=283:3></a> This is very wonderful.<a name=283:4></a> Eve was not only "taken out" of Adam, but was brought to him as a suited companion.<a name=283:5></a> And the church derives its being from Christ, it is His body; but it is also viewed as the antitype of Eve -- the suited companion of Christ.<a name=283:6></a>

		Let us not forget, beloved reader, that this is our place, through grace.<a name=283:12></a>

		(2) The church is also alluded to as formed here in time by the coming of the Holy Spirit and as extended by means of the gospel.<a name=283:13></a> Jews and Gentiles are made joint-heirs and a joint-body by the gospel (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:6">Ephesians  3:6</a>; <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:13">1 Corinthians  12:13</a>).<a name=283:14></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(4) The local gathering of all Christians in one place also has the character of the body of Christ.<a name=284:2></a> The Corinthians were thus addressed.<a name=284:3></a> "<i>Ye</i> are Christ's body" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:27">1 Corinthians  12:27</a>).<a name=284:4></a> They were not the body of Christ in its entirety, but they had the <i>character</i> of the whole, and were to be a local expression of what was true of the body of Christ as a whole.<a name=284:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So that we may say the church as the body of Christ is seen:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(1) As the complement, or fulness of Christ, associated with Him in His position as Head over all things, and in its entirety embraces every believer from Pentecost to the coming of Christ;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(2) As actually formed on earth by the coming of the Holy Spirit and by the gospel;
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(3) As complete on earth at any given time; and

	<div class="paragraph">
		(4) In each local assembly which has the character of the whole.<a name=284:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The prominent idea connected with the church as the body of Christ is that it may <i>display Christ</i>.<a name=284:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In human life a man is known through his body; and so, in a far more wonderful way, the body of Christ is for the display of Christ, for the practical setting forth of the moral features of Jesus.<a name=284:8></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This is very wonderful and equally exercising to our hearts.<a name=285:3></a> God's thought is that Christ should be morally continued here on earth in His own, in His body.<a name=285:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We must indeed feel how far short the church falls practically in this aspect.<a name=285:5></a> And it should cause real heart searching as to the smallness of the measure in which we have answered to God's mind in this matter.<a name=285:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The subject is a very large one and intensely interesting, and we hope the reader will seek the mind of God as to it and search Scripture in a far more detailed manner than we can develop in these short papers.<a name=285:7></a> We desire to stimulate a spirit of inquiry and exercise.<a name=285:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are, however, two practical thoughts which I venture to suggest.<a name=285:9></a> We have merely begun the subject in so doing.<a name=285:10></a> And what we say we shall remember is applicable to the church, the body of Christ, at any time, as also in any locality.<a name=285:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(1) The Spirit of God has formed the body and unites every member.<a name=285:12></a> "For also in the power of one Spirit <i>we</i> have all been baptised into one body" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:13">1 Corinthians  12:13</a>).<a name=285:13></a> "There is one body, and one Spirit" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:4">Ephesians  4:4</a>).<a name=285:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Individually as different persons we have a different spirit.<a name=285:15></a> But the fact of <i>one</i> Spirit having
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=286>[Page 286]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		baptised us into one body makes unity a living reality -- the "unity of the Spirit" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:3">Ephesians  4:3</a>).<a name=286:1></a> But we must remark that anything of the flesh will rob us of the enjoyment of this unity and of its practical realisation.<a name=286:2></a> It is the unity of the <i>Spirit</i>.<a name=286:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The union of Christendom may be sought after, so-called differences may be dropped as convenience may suggest.<a name=286:4></a> But this is a mere imitation of unity.<a name=286:5></a> Unity can only be in the power of the Spirit of God and in accordance with what is of the Spirit.<a name=286:6></a> Let the Spirit of God have His place and unity will be realised by all who thus honour Him.<a name=286:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We feel this is very solemn.<a name=286:8></a> For it is clear from the setting of Scripture that unless we are in the practical recognition of what is formed on earth in the power of the Spirit, unless we are in the enjoyment and good of this unity, it is futile to speak of the Headship of Christ.<a name=286:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we follow the way Scripture develops the truth, we shall observe that in Romans and Corinthians Christ is not presented as Head of the body.<a name=286:10></a> The lesson of <i>unity</i> must be learnt first.<a name=286:11></a> But in Colossians and Ephesians He is so presented.<a name=286:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence, as has so often been said, the truth taught in Romans forms the foundation in our souls and makes room for the further light of the church in Corinthians.<a name=286:13></a> And so, if we are practically recognising unity, we shall be led on to the wondrous fact that Christ is Head of His body.<a name=286:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Moreover, the body of Christ is the vessel for the activity of the Spirit (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>).<a name=286:15></a> Any restriction as
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=287>[Page 287]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		to liberty which might prevent the manifestation and exercise of spiritual gift is dishonouring to the Spirit of God.<a name=287:1></a> The Spirit distributes as <i>He will</i>.<a name=287:2></a> He qualifies as well as calls the servant for the work of God (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13:2">Acts  13:2</a>).<a name=287:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Man can neither appoint nor prevent, according to God, the ministry in Christianity.<a name=287:4></a> We are quite sure that the Emperor of Rome was not consulted as to the appointment of servants or as to the exercise of gift in the church in the days of the apostles!<a name=287:5></a> Nor had an apostle authority over the liberty of another servant (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#16:12">1 Corinthians  16:12</a>).<a name=287:6></a> There is no doubt that the labyrinth of present-day ecclesiastical machinery is a very serious slight to the Spirit of God!<a name=287:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence, recognising this unity and liberty in the power of the Spirit, we should regard each other as members of the body of Christ.<a name=287:8></a> As baptised into one body, every member is necessary, each one is comely, and we may care for all (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>).<a name=287:9></a> Oh!<a name=287:10></a> how slow we are to view each other thus.<a name=287:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, as we have said, if we recognise what is formed on earth in the power of the Spirit, Christ as Head of the body will be practically available to us.<a name=287:12></a> This brings us to our second point.<a name=287:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(2) Christ is Head of the body.<a name=287:14></a> It is from Him the body is derived and increases.<a name=287:15></a> All nourishment comes from the Head.<a name=287:16></a> All fulness dwells in the Head, and the all-sufficient resources of the Head are available to the body (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:15">Ephesians  4:15</a>, 16; <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2">Colossians  2</a>) .<a name=287:17></a>.<a name=287:18></a>.<a name=287:19></a>

		Is it too late in the church's history to "hold the head"?<a name=288:4></a> Is it too late to be quite supported by Christ?<a name=288:5></a> Impossible!<a name=288:6></a> <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2">Colossians  2</a>is still true!<a name=288:7></a> Today we may prove it if we will.<a name=288:8></a> But this needs faith.<a name=288:9></a> It needs a right state on our part.<a name=288:10></a> It is useless to speak of the Headship of Christ if we are practically denying the truth of that of which He is Head.<a name=288:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The incessant formation of councils, of committees of management; the arrangement of spiritual affairs by human wisdom and expediency may suit man's mind.<a name=288:12></a> But it is not faith.<a name=288:13></a> Schism, contention and activity of the flesh grieves the Spirit and must necessarily rob us of the right state which is essential if we are to know Christ as Head.<a name=288:14></a>

		It is God's sovereign pleasure to bring about a cleansing that is perfectly suitable to Himself.<a name=318:2></a> That is what God proposes; not simply to cleanse us so that we can get into heaven without a charge and have some lone seat within the door, but to make us as fit to be presented before Him as ever any holy angel was, and even more than that, for it is a cleansing that could only be brought about by the death of Jesus.<a name=318:3></a> Could there ever be anything more wonderful than that?<a name=318:4></a> Jesus effects cleansing for us through His own death.<a name=318:5></a> It was in the death of Jesus that He really and sacrificially touched the leper.<a name=318:6></a>

		It was the pleasure of God to cleanse us so effectively that not the keenest priestly vision -- not even His own holy eye -- could detect a single trace of leprosy; all pollution is completely gone.<a name=318:7></a> The Lord went to the cross to do that.<a name=318:8></a> The charm of His kindness alone would not meet the case.<a name=318:9></a> He has identified Himself with our sinful state; He has touched us; He has been made sin for us.<a name=318:10></a> Such is the value of the death of Christ that for us who believe on Him there is not a trace of defilement left under the eye of God.<a name=318:11></a> "I will; be thou cleansed" is the word of the cross.<a name=318:12></a> That word rings down through the ages from Calvary.<a name=318:13></a> "I will: be thou cleansed" is a new kind of cleansing altogether; it is not merely ceremonial cleansing such as an Israelite might have by observing the rites and ordinances of the law.<a name=318:14></a> It is a new kind of cleansing which makes us spotless in the presence of the holiness of God, all secured by the death of Jesus.<a name=318:15></a>

		I want to put two things in contrast: on the one side, the incapability of the flesh; and mark this, we have to go through the experience of these chapters.<a name=330:7></a> I quite admit we get in Numbers the history of a people after the flesh; but Christians have to go through the teaching of the chapters.<a name=330:8></a> But while on the one hand we get the perverseness of the flesh, we see in contrast to it, in chapter 15, the immutability of the purpose of God.<a name=330:9></a> God has His own unchanging purpose, and it is impossible for God to be diverted from His purpose.<a name=330:10></a>

		In speaking last time of the tent of the testimony, and of the pillar of fire and of the cloud that rested on it, some may not quite have apprehended what would answer to this in the present time.<a name=331:2></a> It is evident that the testimony of God is not carried about in a tent, as with the children of Israel.<a name=331:3></a> The tabernacle presented an idea which the temple did not present.<a name=331:4></a> The temple was identified with Israel settled in the land.<a name=331:5></a> The people carried the tabernacle with them, according to the divine order; and their movements were entirely guided by the pillar of fire or of cloud upon the tabernacle.<a name=331:6></a> As long as it rested they remained where they were; when it moved they moved.<a name=331:7></a> My concern is only to bring before you what is the answer to it, the antitype, in the present time.<a name=331:8></a> I was speaking of the great importance of the eye of the Christian being fixed upon the tent of the testimony, because it was there that the guidance was vouchsafed.<a name=331:9></a> There was no guidance for the people in detail, but in connection with the tent of the testimony.<a name=331:10></a>

		Where do you think the testimony is now?<a name=331:11></a> The answer may be found in considering what was presented to Israel in type in the tabernacle.<a name=331:12></a> It set forth, as I understand it, the means by which God would put Himself in connection with the universe; the holiest and holy places both had to do with that, and presented the mediatorial way by which God would place Himself in connection with the world of

		Now where do you suppose that the testimony is now?<a name=332:4></a> The subject of the testimony is the Lord Jesus Christ; everything is embodied in Him.<a name=332:5></a> And where is He to be found now?<a name=332:6></a> I know of no place here but in the heart of the believer.<a name=332:7></a> If the Lord has the paramount, commanding place there, then you realise divine guidance.<a name=332:8></a> I do not expect a man to get much if it is simply a question of his circumstances.<a name=332:9></a> God can give mercy, and does; but if you want guidance it is certainly in connection with the testimony of God.<a name=332:10></a> If the testimony of God were the great governing principle in the heart of the saint, divine guidance would be realised in all his pathway through the wilderness.<a name=332:11></a>

		You will remember a passage of the apostle Paul: "God, who spoke that out of darkness light should shine who has shone in our hearts for the shining forth of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:6">2 Corinthians  4:6</a>).<a name=332:12></a> It is in Jesus Christ that God has seen fit to place Himself in relation to the universe.<a name=332:13></a> The light of God's glory has shone forth in Him; and the place of the Lord Jesus Christ at the present moment down here is in the hearts of those that believe in Him.<a name=332:14></a>

		I come now to the chapters to which I referred in order to bring before you the perverseness of the flesh on the one hand, and the resources of the saint on the other.<a name=333:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I will take up first the perverseness of the flesh.<a name=333:7></a> Four things come out in these chapters: <i>firstly</i>, the murmuring of the people; <i>secondly</i>, discontent with the manna, the light bread, and lusting after the food of Egypt; <i>thirdly</i>, the outbreak of Miriam and Aaron against Moses; and then <i>fourthly</i>, the unbelief of the report of the spies.<a name=333:8></a> The murmuring brought in the fire of God; the lusting after Egyptian food brought in the plague; Miriam and Aaron's sin brought leprosy on Miriam; the unbelief of the report of the spies brought in the sentence of God that they should not enter into the land.<a name=333:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Not one bit of flesh enters into the purpose of God.<a name=333:10></a> That is, that you, yourself, as to all that you are after the flesh, are entirely incapable of entering into God's purpose.<a name=333:11></a> We have every one of us to learn this.<a name=333:12></a> It is the lesson which the apostle reached in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7:18">Romans  7:18</a>, "I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, good does not dwell".<a name=333:13></a> It is the new man that is renewed unto full knowledge after the image of Him

	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not want to talk much about the flesh.<a name=334:2></a> Two things always mark it: it is ever hankering after Egypt; and it does not care for Canaan.<a name=334:3></a> You may be sure of that: the life of the flesh is found in Egypt, its sustenance is there; and it does not care for the land -- in other words, for the purpose of God.<a name=334:4></a> I can understand this well.<a name=334:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The case represented by the children of Israel is that of a man saved from the judgment of God, and set free from the power of the enemy.<a name=334:6></a> Suppose a man in the flesh were brought into such a position, what then?<a name=334:7></a> He would perish by the flesh.<a name=334:8></a> Israel came short of the purpose of God, because the flesh, in its spirit and principle, went back to Egypt; it was indisposed to go forward to Canaan.<a name=334:9></a> Why?<a name=334:10></a> Because flesh is essentially unbelieving.<a name=334:11></a> There is no link with God in flesh.<a name=334:12></a> We have to learn this in our experience, and it shows the necessity of God's work in us.<a name=334:13></a> It is absolutely true of the unconverted person, but it is true of the flesh for the Christian.<a name=334:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle speaks of it in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7:25">Romans  7:25</a>: "<i>I myself</i> with the mind serve God's law; but with the flesh sin's law".<a name=334:15></a> It is a good thing to take into account that, as far as you are concerned, even after you are free of the judgment of God and the power of the enemy, you are yourself entirely incapable because of what the flesh is.<a name=334:16></a> The Christian must be enlightened and know that he is free of the power of the enemy; but if he were left in that way, merely

		Now what is the refuge?<a name=335:2></a> Supposing that I have a sense of the perverseness of the flesh, what re-sources have I?<a name=335:3></a> That is what I want to bring before you.<a name=335:4></a> And for that I turn to <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#4">Hebrews  4</a>for a moment.<a name=335:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But first, I will read a few verses in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#3:15">Hebrews  3:15</a> - 19.<a name=335:6></a> It is that last verse that makes me connect the thought with <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#15">Numbers  15</a>.<a name=335:7></a> God swore to those who did not believe the glad tidings of Canaan that they should not enter into His rest.<a name=335:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If you read <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#4:12">Hebrews  4:12</a> - 16 you will find what I understand to be the true resources of a Christian who has come to know the perverseness of the flesh.<a name=335:9></a> He has two things: one is the word of God; the other is the priesthood of Christ.<a name=335:10></a> They are exceedingly important, because they are very great resources.<a name=335:11></a> They divert you from the flesh; that is their practical working.<a name=335:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first is the word of God.<a name=335:13></a> That I understand to be God's revelation of Himself.<a name=335:14></a> It is "living", that is, in the heart of the believer.<a name=335:15></a> You must not confound the ideas of living and life-giving.<a name=335:16></a> The word of God is both.<a name=335:17></a> It lives in the heart of the believer.<a name=335:18></a> It has been said that what is presented to us in the way of testimony -- the light in which God has shone out -- becomes the living principle in the heart of the believer.<a name=335:19></a> We have all the light of God in Christ.<a name=335:20></a> All that He has been pleased to make known of Himself becomes thus a living principle in the soul.<a name=335:21></a> And the word of God settles everything -- brings everything
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=336>[Page 336]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		to light.<a name=336:1></a> But the first thing is, that it is living in the believer.<a name=336:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a common thing for us to say, 'We are in the light, as God is in the light'.<a name=336:3></a> I ask myself sometimes, Is the revelation of God really the light in my heart?<a name=336:4></a> As far as my experience goes, I think we live but little in the blessed consciousness of the light of God so that the revelation of Himself becomes really the vital principle in the heart.<a name=336:5></a> The effect would be a "division of soul and spirit, both of joints and marrow", and the thoughts and intents of the heart would be discerned.<a name=336:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But that is not all; there is another very important principle: you have not merely the word or revelation of God, but you have also a Priest who sympathises.<a name=336:7></a> What we have got to is this: that we have to go through the world and to discern between good and evil, and we shall never discern these in the world if we do not first discern them in ourselves.<a name=336:8></a> The moment the Christian is started on this path he has the sympathy of Christ.<a name=336:9></a> That comes out in verse 15: "we have not a high priest not able to sympathise with our infirmities, but tempted in all things in like manner, sin apart".<a name=336:10></a> We get the sympathy and support of the Priest.<a name=336:11></a> Have we realised this?<a name=336:12></a> The word of God, as the living principle, and the priesthood of Christ -- the expression of His sympathy and love.<a name=336:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think that is the practical divine answer to the perverseness of the flesh.<a name=336:14></a> There is another answer, I admit -- the Spirit in the believer; but you have to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This all runs parallel with the truth of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6">Romans  6</a>, 7.<a name=337:5></a> We start on the right path in chapter 6, and in chapter 7 we get the support of "the husband", the Priest.<a name=337:6></a> Christ is law to us.<a name=337:7></a> The practical working of all is that though the flesh is not changed a bit -- it is just as perverse as ever -- yet I am alive to its perverseness.<a name=337:8></a> That is a great point.<a name=337:9></a> I do not expect any change in it, or any amelioration; but I am diverted from it by the word of God and the priesthood of Christ.<a name=337:10></a> These are the great resources which God has given me.<a name=337:11></a> In everything, prayer, approach to God, it is a wonderful thing for us to realise how God has shone forth in light, and the soul is kept in His light; and then we touch the sympathy, the love of the Priest who has passed through the heavens, so that we come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.<a name=337:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is our side.<a name=337:13></a> The points on which we have touched so far are the perverseness of the flesh and God's resources for us.<a name=337:14></a> There remain with us terrible reminiscences of Egypt.<a name=337:15></a> The people brought into the wilderness had been in Egypt; and Christians too have been in the world, and bring the reminiscences of it with them, and this is a standing trial.<a name=337:16></a> The flesh

		In the days of the tabernacle or temple there was a material kind of worship -- a worship which man in the flesh could render.<a name=342:6></a> First-fruits of earth's harvests were presented, incense was constantly ascending, and musical instruments, too, were used as ordained by the sweet Psalmist of Israel.<a name=342:7></a> All that was worship of a material or fleshly<a href="#342:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a> kind.<a name=342:8></a>

		We see on all hands the abandoning of the true character of Christianity, and a return to the elements of a carnal and earthly religion.<a name=343:1></a> Buildings are called God's house; harvest festivals are quite common; worship is assisted by strains of music from a lifeless instrument!<a name=343:2></a> And in some quarters, indeed, we find men assuming the office of an earthly priesthood offering incense of a material kind.<a name=343:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us be perfectly clear on this point.<a name=343:4></a> All this is a denial of the very character of real Christianity.<a name=343:5></a> It is a return to an earthly and carnal religion of a past dispensation under the name and cloak of Christianity.<a name=343:6></a> Hence, however well intended, it is a very serious disregard of God's expressed mind.<a name=343:7></a> It is really iniquity in God's holy things.<a name=343:8></a> It may be done in ignorance.<a name=343:9></a> We believe it is.<a name=343:10></a> But it is nevertheless iniquity.<a name=343:11></a> (See <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#5:14">Leviticus  5:14</a> - 19).<a name=343:12></a>

		(3) <i>Praise and prayer mark God's house</i>.<a name=343:13></a> Associated with the idea of God's house we find the subject of priesthood, and hence, also, as we have already suggested, the thoughts of access, intercession and praise.<a name=343:14></a> "Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be constantly praising thee" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#84:4">Psalm  84:4</a>), the psalmist could say.<a name=343:15></a>

		What gladness when we may "go up" to God's house -- when we can leave our things, and in company with other Christians enter upon our proper spiritual privileges as forming God's house!<a name=344:11></a> Depend upon it, we shall prosper spiritually if we are marked by this love for God's centre of interest (verse 6).<a name=344:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We read of some whose interest waned as to God's house.<a name=344:13></a> They were busy with regard to their own houses and yet were content to see God's house lie waste.<a name=344:14></a> (See <a href="../bible/Haggai.htm#1">Haggai  1</a>).<a name=344:15></a> No wonder there was no prosperity!<a name=344:16></a> But when God's interest became theirs how different everything was!<a name=344:17></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second parable is that of the vineyard which was let to husbandmen, who were to render to the owner the fruits in due season (verses 33 - 41).<a name=346:3></a> In this parable the Lord speaks of His own coming as the Son, who is Heir.<a name=346:4></a> In His coming there was the consummation of all earthly privilege.<a name=346:5></a> Those who, according to the previous parable, had failed in responsibility and had John's ministry, joined to cast out the Heir that they might seize the inheritance.<a name=346:6></a> In the death of Christ we see the slaying of the Heir; when Antichrist reigns it will be fully seen that the inheritance has been seized.<a name=346:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The third parable, which opens chapter 22, is a setting forth of pure grace in connection with the Son.<a name=346:8></a> It is no longer responsibility, or earthly privilege, but the King acting for the honour and joy of His Son.<a name=346:9></a> This is typical of the present period.<a name=346:10></a> The figure is that of a marriage feast for the satisfaction of the One who provides it.<a name=346:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Both in this chapter and also in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#14">Luke  14</a>and 15 we have the idea of a feast.<a name=347:4></a> From the beginning God had more in view than merely meeting the need of man.<a name=347:5></a> We catch a glimpse of this in Old Testament times in the feasts of Jehovah.<a name=347:6></a> God, then, showed that He had delight in gathering His people festively around Himself.<a name=347:7></a> He would make even their fasts to become occasions of "joy and gladness, and cheerful gatherings" (<a href="../bible/Zechariah.htm#8:19">Zechariah  8:19</a>).<a name=347:8></a> In them His own joy must be greatest, but He desired others to share in it.<a name=347:9></a> This is wonderful!<a name=347:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The question of title is raised in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#22:11">Matthew  22:11</a>.<a name=347:11></a> The end of the man who had not on a wedding garment shows that he had no title to the feast, and so came under the displeasure of the One who had made it.<a name=347:12></a> There is no alternative.<a name=347:13></a> Though a man be perfectly irreproachable in his character and conduct, he has no title thereby to the feast.<a name=347:14></a> The festivity all centres in the King's Son, and no one can have part in it on the ground of anything that he is in himself.<a name=347:15></a> The wedding garment is the sign that one is there, in honour of Him.<a name=347:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		If anyone had natural title to the feast the Jew had, for to him pertained earthly privilege, but the previous chapter has shown that this is all forfeited, and therefore even the Jew can only come in on the ground of grace and of what Christ is.<a name=347:17></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two men brought before us in Scripture: the man that grieved God in His heart, in whom we have all had our part; and Christ the One who is for God's pleasure.<a name=348:6></a> We all naturally are more or less self-confident and think much of ourselves.<a name=348:7></a> The work of the Spirit of God is to break down confidence in ourselves and to lead us to confidence in that blessed One.<a name=348:8></a> What may be called the moral ground of faith is, that we abandon all thought and hope of ourselves as those who are thoroughly corrupt, and we take the ground of what Christ is (for God's whole delight is in Him) and this constitutes our title to the feast.<a name=348:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:16">Galatians  2:16</a> the apostle tells us that no flesh can be justified by works of law.<a name=348:10></a> The law is the divine standard of man's responsibility to God, but no one can be justified on that principle.<a name=348:11></a> We can only be justified on the principle of faith in Christ.<a name=348:12></a> Justification in its full sense goes beyond clearance from guilt and judgment; we are cleared in God's account of all participation in Adam's fallen race, and this can only be in Christ.<a name=348:13></a> We are justified in

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in the same chapter, <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:19">Galatians  2:19</a>, we come to the second point.<a name=349:2></a> The apostle says, "<i>I</i>, through law, have died to law, that I may live to God".<a name=349:3></a> The closing expression of this verse is similar to that used of the Lord Jesus in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#6:10">Romans  6:10</a>: "in that he has died, he has died to sin once for all; but in that he lives, he lives to God".<a name=349:4></a> Looking at the expression in regard to Him we appreciate its sweetness.<a name=349:5></a> There was One who had to do with men here on earth, though morally separate from them; He endured the contradiction of sinners against Himself, and in the end gave up His life in sacrifice to God.<a name=349:6></a> The Scripture speaks of His dying to sin.<a name=349:7></a> He had only to do with it in conflict against it, sacrificially, but even so He has died to it, and has no more to say to it.<a name=349:8></a> Now He lives to God.<a name=349:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is therefore a Man in the presence of God whose life has respect wholly to Him, and who is there to His perfect satisfaction; not only morally so, as when on earth, but in the glorious condition of manhood that God purposed from eternity.<a name=349:10></a> Even if He were alone, we see God's thought set forth in Him and can rejoice that God has a Man before Him to His entire and eternal satisfaction.<a name=349:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Paul takes it up in regard to himself, and speaks of living to God.<a name=349:12></a> How can this be?<a name=349:13></a> One cannot now live to God in flesh, for since Christ has died, flesh has no place with God.<a name=349:14></a> There is the recognition of this with Paul when he goes on to say, "I am crucified with Christ" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:20">Galatians  2:20</a>).<a name=349:15></a> Crucifixion

		was by sentence of condemnation, and therefore it might be said, if it were possible to revive the crucified, it would not be lawful, for a sentence stands recorded against him.<a name=350:1></a> Peter was attempting revival.<a name=350:2></a> Paul would not have it; "I am crucified with Christ".<a name=350:3></a> There was the determined recognition of the end of all that the flesh is in the cross of Christ.<a name=350:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		He then continues, "Christ lives in me".<a name=350:5></a> It is only in virtue of Christ living in us that we live to God.<a name=350:6></a> Nothing but Christ can be for God's satisfaction.<a name=350:7></a> The anxiety of the apostle for the Galatians was that Christ might be formed in them.<a name=350:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15">Luke  15</a>, we see that the welcomed one is held as cleared by the Father when He runs forth to greet him, but in order to join the festivity of the house there must be fitness, and this is found in the best robe.<a name=350:9></a> No doubt it sets forth Christ, but it is Christ as forming the state and character of His people.<a name=350:10></a> It is only as we are thus formed that we can enjoy the feast, however certain our title to it may be.<a name=350:11></a> Whatever the flesh may be, it has no relish for God's feast.<a name=350:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Spirit who has been given to us not only assures us that we are perfectly cleared in God's account from all that the flesh is, so that all the blessing of God can be bestowed upon us, but He also forms Christ in us, so that we live no longer, but Christ lives in us, and it is thus we live to God, and have all the enjoyment of the feast which has been spread.<a name=350:13></a>

		I have been impressed, beloved, with the possibilities in service, for I believe the Lord is helping us distinctly, and educating us in view of service.<a name=353:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We are told in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#4:3">Numbers  4:3</a>, in connection with those who enter into the service, that it is a service to which one is subjected, involving suffering, labour, and warfare (see footnote <i>a</i>).<a name=353:3></a> Hence we are to be impressed with the character of the service into which, through grace, we are privileged to enter.<a name=353:4></a> It is not to be undertaken lightly; it is to be a hard and rigorous service.<a name=353:5></a> Not that it is without compensation, for indeed it has many compensations.<a name=353:6></a> Nevertheless, that is the standpoint from which the service is first viewed, and those who serve must be acquainted with suffering and labour and warfare.<a name=353:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The long and distinguished line of holy men and holy women who have served, as set before us in the Scriptures, only serves to humble us in regard to the poverty of our own service.<a name=353:8></a> One cannot think of the prophets, for example, without being ashamed of one's lack of devotion.<a name=353:9></a> These holy men of God suffered intensely, but they continued in their service as definitely sustained by God, having accepted from the outset what the service involved.<a name=353:10></a>

		Now, in turning to the Acts of the Apostles, I desire to draw attention to three servants -- Stephen, Peter, and Paul.<a name=353:11></a> Stephen is found serving in the great unbelieving profession, and the outstanding feature

		with him is spirituality.<a name=354:1></a> Peter is serving amongst the brethren, and as serving thus, what is stressed is the great need of patience, as we see in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>.<a name=354:2></a> Then we come to Paul; his service is described in chapter 13, where we find him serving in a sphere of hostility to Christ, but he is marked by great boldness and moral power.<a name=354:3></a> It is of these three features I would speak -- spirituality, patience, and power.<a name=354:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Most of us are acquainted with the history of Stephen, and I refer particularly to his beginning.<a name=354:5></a> It is said that "they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit".<a name=354:6></a> Thus we are shown a vessel who was full; there was no admixture, there were no double motives with Stephen.<a name=354:7></a> He was a filled vessel, "full of faith and the Holy Spirit".<a name=354:8></a> These features marked him as amongst the saints; but we also read of Stephen's public movements in service, and then he is said to be "full of grace and power", not faith exactly, for faith is the inward thing, but "full of grace and power".<a name=354:9></a> These four features regarding Stephen are of great importance.<a name=354:10></a> He was full of faith and the Holy Spirit, and then he was full of grace and power.<a name=354:11></a> That is the basis from which Stephen's remarkable service flows forth.<a name=354:12></a> It was not, as we know, a lengthy service, but it was powerful, and he served as being filled.<a name=354:13></a> Oh!<a name=354:14></a> that one might serve like that.<a name=354:15></a> If the servant is filled, there is no room for admixture, no room for ulterior or double motives in the service.<a name=354:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then it is said that being full of grace and power, Stephen did great wonders and miracles among the

		people.<a name=355:1></a> His deportment, as serving, reminds us, surely, of the grace and features of another Man, even the Lord Jesus Christ as seen in Luke's gospel.<a name=355:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would plead for greater attention to this matter of spirituality in service.<a name=355:3></a> In Luke's gospel we are reminded of persons who were filled with the Spirit.<a name=355:4></a> Thus John the Baptist (chapter 1: 15), and Zacharias (chapter 1: 67), and Elizabeth (chapter 1: 41), are all said to have been "filled with the Holy Spirit".<a name=355:5></a> Then it is said of Mary: "The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee" (chapter 1: 35), and again of Simeon that "the Holy Spirit was upon him", and that "it was divinely communicated to him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death before he should see the Lord's Christ" (chapter 2: 25, 26).<a name=355:6></a> Then, which is surely a very important feature, it is said of Simeon that "he came <i>in</i> the Spirit into the temple" (verse 27).<a name=355:7></a> What a trust-worthy vessel is this man, one, as we may say, moving entirely under the control of the Holy Spirit.<a name=355:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now these are the individuals who have to do with the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=355:9></a> They are privileged to encircle and to handle, as Simeon did, "that holy thing" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:35">Luke  1:35</a>).<a name=355:10></a> One would speak guardedly in reference to "that holy thing" -- how much spirituality is needed to speak of that!<a name=355:11></a> There is Simeon in spiritual power, and as he took the Babe in his arms, he blessed God.<a name=355:12></a> That was an evidence of His spirituality; and after he had blessed God, he blessed Joseph and Mary.<a name=355:13></a> In chapter 10 we have one who as having set herself down at Jesus' feet, was listening to His word (verse 39).<a name=355:14></a> Following that we have

		the request on the part of one of the disciples who heard Jesus praying, "Lord, teach us to pray" (chapter 11: 1).<a name=356:1></a> I mention these things, hearing and praying, particularly because of what occurs in chapter 12.<a name=356:2></a> It is said that the multitude was so great "that they trod one on another" (verse 1).<a name=356:3></a> This marks men today in increasing measure.<a name=356:4></a> But the Lord began to speak to His disciples first.<a name=356:5></a> He had as yet nothing to say to the crowds, but He had much to say to His disciples, and in the presence of the crowds He called them a "little flock" (verse 32), and one outstanding feature of the <i>little</i> flock is spirituality, and this in a hostile world.<a name=356:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have no doubt at all that Stephen understood these things; so that, being full of grace and power, as in the service, he is at once apprehended, as if the enemy would say, This cannot go on!<a name=356:7></a> He is arraigned before the council, and it is said that they saw his face "as the face of an angel" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#6:15">Acts  6:15</a>).<a name=356:8></a> What a most delightful countenance!<a name=356:9></a> <i>They</i> saw it, but how must that face have appeared to heaven?<a name=356:10></a> At first they could not resist the wisdom and Spirit with which he spoke, but now his spirituality shines through his countenance, in the presence of those who hate him and who would finally put him to death.<a name=356:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another very precious thing about Stephen is that he was not only marked by spirituality, but by a very wide knowledge of the holy Scriptures.<a name=356:12></a> You remember in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#12:12">Luke  12:12</a> that the Lord, encouraging His disciples, tells them they were not to be careful

	<div class="paragraph">
		One has often been ashamed of one's little knowledge of Scripture when reading this seventh chapter of the Acts of the Apostles.<a name=357:5></a> How few of us could give an impromptu rsum of the testimony, and the ways of God in it, as Stephen does here!<a name=357:6></a> He has no time to prepare his address, but he is taught in the same hour.<a name=357:7></a> He begins by speaking about the "God of glory", and says, He "appeared to our father Abraham" (verse 2).<a name=357:8></a> There are no partial thoughts or feelings with Stephen; he would claim even those men sitting in the council as of Abraham.<a name=357:9></a> Then he speaks about eight others who were links in the chain of testimony: Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Aaron, Joshua, David, and Solomon, showing what wonderful knowledge he had of the holy Scriptures; how he must have read them.<a name=357:10></a>

		Do you not think that the spirit of Moses had its counterpart in the spirit of Stephen as he stood before the council?<a name=358:5></a> Has Stephen hard feelings about his circumstances?<a name=358:6></a> Is he becoming irritated by this persecution?<a name=358:7></a> Not at all!<a name=358:8></a> He is concerned about the testimony of God to the profession.<a name=358:9></a> He speaks with power of the "coming of the Just One", and as he mentions the Just One we find that there is a remarkable change over the council: they show their hostility.<a name=358:10></a> But Stephen with great courage continues his witness, for spirituality involves great moral power and courage, and he says, "O stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, <i>ye</i> do always resist the Holy Spirit; as your fathers, <i>ye</i> also" (verse 51).<a name=358:11></a> Is not that the great sin of Christendom?<a name=358:12></a> Not only ignoring, and setting aside, the Holy Spirit, speaking of Him as an influence, but, as it says here, resisting the Holy Spirit.<a name=358:13></a> "As your fathers, <i>ye</i> also".<a name=358:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Here, we may say, is this constant mind, this steady, sustained gaze into heaven, but it is as filled with the Holy Spirit.<a name=359:11></a> Stephen sees "the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God".<a name=359:12></a> Again he renders testimony, not as to all that he had seen, but to part of it.<a name=359:13></a> He does not say, 'I see the glory God and Jesus', but "I behold .<a name=359:14></a>.<a name=359:15></a>.<a name=359:16></a> the Son of man standing at the right hand of God" (verse 56).<a name=359:17></a> It was the Son of man.<a name=359:18></a> How discriminative!<a name=359:19></a> He was a man of spiritual discernment.<a name=359:20></a> "The Son of man" refers to the kind of testimony publicly, involving finally the supreme authority of Christ in that day when He will cover the whole earth with the knowledge of God as the waters cover the sea (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#11:9">Isaiah  11:9</a>).<a name=359:21></a>

		Referring to Peter, what is emphasised is the great need of patience.<a name=360:6></a> It is said of Peter that as he went up to Jerusalem those who were of the circumcision contended with him.<a name=360:7></a> Now we have an atmosphere of contention, and contention from those who did not understand.<a name=360:8></a> That is a very serious thing.<a name=360:9></a> If I do not understand, I should at least seek not to contend.<a name=360:10></a> There are things in the way of ministry that one has not understood at times, but I am not called upon to contend in regard of that which I do not understand.<a name=360:11></a>

		Against what were these men contending?<a name=360:12></a> Consciously or unconsciously, it was against the operations of God, and of the Holy Spirit.<a name=360:13></a> Think of that!<a name=360:14></a> They contended with Peter.<a name=360:15></a> Does he assert his apostleship?<a name=360:16></a> Does he say, The thing is so plain and apparent that I do not need to give an account of it?<a name=360:17></a> Not at all.<a name=360:18></a> The scripture says, "But Peter began and set forth the matter to them in order".<a name=360:19></a> These contenders are to be met by patience.<a name=360:20></a> It is a serious thing, if I do not understand, to contend about a thing.<a name=360:21></a> It is better to be like Jacob in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#37:11">Genesis  37:11</a>, when Joseph told his second dream to his brethren.<a name=360:22></a> They envied him, they did not understand that kind of ministry; it was something entirely new, and they envied him; but "his father kept the saying", Jacob did not contend.<a name=360:23></a> That is wisdom.<a name=360:24></a> If something is

		Think of the kind of man that Peter was naturally.<a name=361:2></a> He had been an impulsive, forceful man; he had cut off the ear of the high priest's servant.<a name=361:3></a> As they came to Capernaum on one occasion, men came to Peter and said, "Does your teacher not pay the didrachmas?<a name=361:4></a>" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#17:24">Matthew  17:24</a>).<a name=361:5></a> And he said, "Yes".<a name=361:6></a> Why should he reply for Jesus?<a name=361:7></a> Why not wait to ask his Lord about the tribute money?<a name=361:8></a> But the Lord, in His tender, ever patient grace, anticipates Simon and says, "the kings of the earth, from whom do they receive custom or tribute?<a name=361:9></a> from their own sons or from strangers?<a name=361:10></a>" (verse 25).<a name=361:11></a> "But", He says, "that we may not be an offence to them" (verse 27) -- that is the principle that Peter must learn.<a name=361:12></a> We are not to offend.<a name=361:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Peter in this chapter (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#11">Acts  11</a>) is marked by great patience; a quality totally foreign to him on the line of nature, but having acquired great spirituality and patience, he "set forth the matter to them in order" -- not always an easy thing to do.<a name=361:14></a> The tendency is ever present with us to exhibit the irritability of the flesh in such matters, for impatience marks us naturally: instead of which the Lord would have us in patience and grace to rehearse what we have known to be the operations of God through the Spirit.<a name=361:15></a> So, as Peter rehearses the matter and speaks of the Holy Spirit falling on them, he adds, "who indeed was <i>I</i> to be able to forbid God?<a name=361:16></a>" (verse 17).<a name=361:17></a>
