		I think, dear brethren, that we have been impressed during these days together with the greatness and glory of the economy which God intends to bring us into; the conscious joy and experience of what it is to be brought into the great spiritual climax of the dispensation.<a name=1:1></a> God is working to this glorious end.<a name=1:2></a> Let no one doubt it.<a name=1:3></a> God has provided every assistance, He has furnished the holy environment in which the precious testimony is to be carried through.<a name=1:4></a> It has been referred to several times as the circle of affection, the circle of the truth, and the circle of the fellowship.<a name=1:5></a> And what is in mind at the moment is, with the help of the Lord, to enable us to see that there is a moral process, a moral road, by which we come definitely and spiritually into this great realm where the glories of headship are known and answered to; that we might know consciously, what it is to have our part in relation to this great vessel, the assembly.<a name=1:6></a> We have been speaking of glory, our brother has helped in the thought of the glory of such a vessel.<a name=1:7></a> How relatively equal she is to Christ - His bride, His complement, a vessel in which His headship is carried through and displayed; the headship of this glorious Personage, our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=1:8></a> God has given Him to be "Head over all things to the assembly, which is his body, the fulness of him who fills all in all" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:22">Ephesians  1:22</a>, 23).<a name=1:9></a>

		The scripture we read in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>shows the way we begin on our side; we begin with the gospel.<a name=2:2></a> I want to be simple, to touch on what is elementary; to show that what we have been speaking of is not outside the range of any true believer, of any heart that loves Christ and loves God.<a name=2:3></a> If you have not touched it there is a reason, for it is available.<a name=2:4></a> I am impressed with what God has recovered to us, bringing forward in our day the top stone, the acme of ministry.<a name=2:5></a> It is the last hour, the last moment of this present dispensation.<a name=2:6></a> Do you, young or old, want to be out of it, outside the circle of affection in the sphere of the glories of that blessed Person, of His headship?<a name=2:7></a> Do we know what it is to be brought consciously and livingly into it?<a name=2:8></a> To be identified with all the holy and blessed features that mark the testimony?<a name=2:9></a> How they have been handed down and added to!<a name=2:10></a> What additional wealth and glories are seen in the position!<a name=2:11></a> God would not have any of His lovers to be outside of it; it is to our shame if we are.<a name=2:12></a> If there is anyone not moving happily with the brethren, his own ideas of matters standing in the way, though he may have difficulties and not know how to move, God is ready to assist him.<a name=2:13></a> In chapter 30 of Isaiah there is a remarkable word: "This is the way, walk ye in it" (verse 21), as if God would not allow any of us to walk without having a word.<a name=2:14></a> Maybe there has been no spiritual reaction to it.<a name=2:15></a> One has

		been impressed with this word 'reaction;' if there is no reaction to the ministry in my soul, I become stagnant, and finally become attached in principle to what is eventually apostate.<a name=3:1></a> Reaction involves a good deal of spiritual heart searching, disposing of impediments, hindrances to what God is bringing His beloved people into.<a name=3:2></a> The spiritual reaction to the ministry involves a moral evolution going on inwardly.<a name=3:3></a> The testimony is a testing matter; it embraces every living, vital feature of the whole economy, all that God is opening up.<a name=3:4></a> God is bringing forward the best, the mesh becomes finer, are we ready for that?<a name=3:5></a>

		I begin with the verses we read in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>, "Let the whole house of Israel therefore know assuredly that God has made him, this Jesus whom <i>ye</i> have crucified, both Lord and Christ".<a name=3:6></a> The power and unction in those who heard brought out this spiritual reaction.<a name=3:7></a> "What shall we do, brethren?<a name=3:8></a>" they said, (verse 37).<a name=3:9></a> Think of such a question in the presence of what Peter had brought forward; the Spirit poured out, giving a witness and testimony to the exaltation and supremacy of the lowly sufferer, Jesus!<a name=3:10></a> Now having been raised by the mighty power of God, the same God who has given Him to be Head over all things to the assembly, He has been made both Lord and Christ.<a name=3:11></a> If only we could reach the glorious climax, not nominally, but in the thing sympathetically with Him, in the mighty current of His operations!<a name=3:12></a> "They go from strength to strength: each one will appear before God in Zion" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#84:7">Psalm  84:7</a>).<a name=3:13></a> Why should I not be in it?<a name=3:14></a> I appeal to the youngest to take this matter up tonight.<a name=3:15></a> Have you fully recognised what God has

		This paves the way for Paul's ministry, for the understanding of the glories of His headship.<a name=4:3></a> This same Jesus made both Lord and Christ: what does this mean?<a name=4:4></a> It means that every other lord has to be disposed of; that the lover of Christ has to relinquish every other claim.<a name=4:5></a> No wonder that Saul, when he heard the words, "Why dost thou persecute me?<a name=4:6></a>" said, "Who art thou, Lord?<a name=4:7></a>" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:4">Acts  9:4</a>, 5).<a name=4:8></a> Not 'Christ' yet, but 'Lord'.<a name=4:9></a> What is bound up in that word "Me"?<a name=4:10></a> Paul is to be the minister of the assembly, to unfold the glories of it and set forth what Christ is as Head to it, and to bring us into living relation to Him as Lord, and Christ and Head.<a name=4:11></a> God has given Him a name above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow; God has made Him both Lord and Christ.<a name=4:12></a> Do you get on your knees and call Him <i>Lord Jesus</i>?<a name=4:13></a> No one calls Him Lord Jesus except in the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=4:14></a> Let me ask you, 'Is He your Lord?<a name=4:15></a>' Let me challenge my own heart, 'Is He my Lord?<a name=4:16></a>' It involves a subjective answer in my heart and in all my inwards, to come under His touch and power and own Him as Lord.<a name=4:17></a> God has made Him, not only Lord, but Christ, the Messiah, the Anointed, for light to one's soul.<a name=4:18></a> I know, like the woman in <a href="../bible/John.htm#4">John  4</a>, that He can do everything.<a name=4:19></a> She said, "Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done: is not he the Christ?<a name=4:20></a>" He will tell you all things that ever you did.<a name=4:21></a> Has He come near to your heart to make way for the knowledge of His glorious Person in headship?<a name=4:22></a> He wants to bring all of us into it - which means that our wills, the source of all difficulty in our local

		To come now to <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#35">Isaiah  35</a>there God makes His proposals; He brings forward what He is ready to do, and He does it.<a name=5:5></a> There is no breakdown on the part of God in what He does; the breakdown is all on our side; it is because there is no reaction to the ministry.<a name=5:6></a> God has recovered every detail of the truth from the top to the bottom, and from the bottom to the top, and He intends to bring us to the top that He may be served, that He may have His rightful place in headship.<a name=5:7></a> "The wilderness and the dry land shall be gladdened; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose".<a name=5:8></a> Where wilderness conditions are, God loves to bring in fertility.<a name=5:9></a> It is His own precious work, and the end is that "they shall obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away".<a name=5:10></a> Spiritual buoyancy marks the circle, joy and gladness obtaining, reached by the way of this moral process.<a name=5:11></a> This comes into view in a concrete way as His people take on these thoughts constitutionally.<a name=5:12></a> God makes Him both Lord and Christ.<a name=5:13></a> He would comfort, encourage, and stimulate, to see what is to flow out of His own blessed workmanship.<a name=5:14></a> "The glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon.<a name=5:15></a> They shall see the glory of Jehovah, the excellency of our God".<a name=5:16></a> What does it mean, the glory of Jehovah, the excellency of our God?<a name=5:17></a> It means that He

		There are, I understand, two viewpoints of this book: one, that the assembly's history finishes on earth at the end of chapter 3; the other that the history runs through in a moral way so that we have analogies of prophetically recorded happenings for our learning.<a name=13:3></a> I am using the latter view as the basis of my remarks, and I see evidence at the end of the book that the rebuke and discipline have accomplished something with which the Bridegroom is pleased.<a name=13:4></a> In chapter 19: 7 it says, "His wife has made herself ready".<a name=13:5></a> Then in chapter 22: 16, 17 it says, "<i>I</i> Jesus have sent mine angel .<a name=13:6></a>.<a name=13:7></a>.<a name=13:8></a> And the Spirit and the bride say, Come".<a name=13:9></a> How different this language is from what we have at the beginning!<a name=13:10></a> There is liberty now for what is intensely personal, "<i>I</i> Jesus".<a name=13:11></a> That is the Bridegroom speaking in love's intimacy and without reserve.<a name=13:12></a> The Bridegroom has waited and served in conditions that bring out His skill, but the time has come for the consummation of love.<a name=13:13></a> The only remaining reason for waiting is that "he that will, let him take the water of life freely" (verse 17).<a name=13:14></a>

		Now returning to the thought of the throne and the Lamb, it is important to see that while divine power is being exercised in this world, it stands related to the Lamb, to Christ, to His sufferings and death.<a name=16:1></a> The mighty power of God can carry any matter through, and deliver, but "the Lamb" is an evidence that things can also be carried through in suffering.<a name=16:2></a> The Lamb is said to be standing as slain in the midst of the throne.<a name=16:3></a> It is a resurrection figure, death is behind.<a name=16:4></a> The One who suffered and died on man's behalf is alive, and all the power of God is operative in relation to Him.<a name=16:5></a> The power to intervene actively is suggested as sealed in a book, and only the moral worthiness of the Lamb can open it.<a name=16:6></a> It is the evidence that all that the throne demanded has been met in suffering.<a name=16:7></a> He will be equal to every requirement of judgment when the time comes, but while that moment waits He is equal to supporting the saints in suffering.<a name=16:8></a> Any situation can be met, either by the power of the throne to deliver, or by the support of the One who suffered.<a name=16:9></a> The position is impregnable.<a name=16:10></a> God does not need to shorten the dispensation because of the sufferings of the saints; He can prolong it for the sake of men, but at any moment He can bring it to a close.<a name=16:11></a> The Lamb's wife must be trained in suffering, else how could she appreciate the One whose part in divine counsels was to suffer?<a name=16:12></a> How free God is!<a name=16:13></a> His compassions shine now in testimony in the gospel, and while men do not understand the position, the assembly does.<a name=16:14></a> God is glorified and Christ is made great to us.<a name=16:15></a> The two things go hand-in-hand: the greatest power to deliver, and the power to carry on in suffering, for in suffering the service of discipline and

		The last thought, linked with the two foregoing, is that of the bondman.<a name=17:7></a><a name=17:4></a> This book is written for such, that they might be intelligent as to the mind and ways of God.<a name=17:8></a><a name=17:5></a> The bondman idea involves unquestioning subjection to the will of God.<a name=17:9></a><a name=17:6></a> It is easy to speak about it, but hard when we go through the training of it, as the line of <a href=".<a name=17:10></a>.<a name=17:11></a>\hymns\hymns1972.<a name=17:12></a>htm#85:6">Hymn 85</a> says, 'In proving no will but His'.<a name=17:13></a> A woman bereft of her husband; children bereft of a father or a mother; they are going through deep waters.<a name=17:14></a> How comforting at such a time to draw near to God as a bondman, subject, restful, inquiring, perhaps, for bondmen are greatly privileged in heaven.<a name=17:15></a> Think of John being called up to heaven that he might see and record this revelation of Jesus Christ.<a name=17:16></a> It is given for bondmen.<a name=17:17></a> It concerns heaven, but how the concerns of heaven would lift us above the trials of earth!<a name=17:18></a> Heaven's concerns are great matters; and John is taken to a favourable viewpoint, the throne, to see certain things, to get the basis of heaven's activities in his soul.<a name=17:19></a> Then he is taken to another viewpoint, the sand of the sea, that he might behold a beast rising out of the sea; then to a mountain, to see the bride, the Lamb's wife.<a name=17:20></a> He is being personally conducted through this vision of divine activities and glories, which to a man without divine support would be overwhelming; but the bondman of God is given support

		How quickly John reacts to what is presented to him!<a name=18:3></a> When he saw the Lord in His judicial garments, with evidences of His divine majesty surrounding Him, he fell at His feet as dead.<a name=18:4></a> What an experience that was!<a name=18:5></a> I wonder if we all have had to do with the Lord like that?<a name=18:6></a> We are so accustomed to thinking of Him as meek and lowly, and rightly so, that we might be in danger of forgetting who He is, and what surroundings He is entitled to, and that comely behaviour in the presence of such a manifestation is to fall at His feet as dead.<a name=18:7></a> What intelligence John gathers as he is passed through these experiences!<a name=18:8></a> He learns how God will deal with everything that has opposed Him and despised Christ.<a name=18:9></a> But he also learns how the Lord can deal with the false and apostate church, while recovering what is for Himself, the element that is responsive to His rebuke and discipline, held in attachment to Him because of His great love.<a name=18:10></a> That love is a holy love, and when the Bridegroom is pleased with His work it means there is nothing of unholiness remaining in it.<a name=18:11></a> The present result, a moral result, is that the bride is secured.<a name=18:12></a>

		These personal confessions, as I might call them, of the apostle Paul, form a necessary part of his ministry and I refer to them for our encouragement and help.<a name=21:1></a> In dealing with the great expanse of counsel, he, thank God, carries us along with him.<a name=21:2></a> He does not isolate himself in connection with the plan of divine counsel.<a name=21:3></a> He thinks of the scheme in its greatness and brings all the saints with him as he says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:3">Ephesians  1:3</a>).<a name=21:4></a> But in these instances I have cited, and there are others doubtless, he appears as bearing testimony as to himself personally; he purposely isolates himself in regard to what he says, when doubtless he might have included others with him.<a name=21:5></a> Luke secures this gem - "I believe God" - for us; the others are in the epistles.<a name=21:6></a> Unjealous Luke might well have been included in this first confession of the apostle, but Paul is alone in it.<a name=21:7></a> His confession is in the midst of an imminent ship-wreck and a number of souls are there - two hundred and seventy-six.<a name=21:8></a> We are not told of, nor does Luke record, any gospel meetings or other meetings on the ship, but he does tell us that in the midst of all the chaos, the apostle stands up and says, "I believe God".<a name=21:9></a> He might have included Luke in that;

		It will be apparent from the scriptures read that one has in mind to speak of moral adjustment in relation to the Lord's service; how He brought in adjustment in the several cases before us.<a name=29:1></a> The first passage opens with the words that Jesus entered <i>again</i> into the synagogue, indicating that He had been there before.<a name=29:2></a> That was in chapter 1, where we are told that as Jesus entered into the synagogue a man with an unclean spirit cried out, "Eh!<a name=29:3></a> what have we to do with thee, Jesus, Nazarene?<a name=29:4></a>" (verse 24).<a name=29:5></a> The Authorised version says, "Let <i>us</i> alone", and this is the sense of the exclamation.<a name=29:6></a> One feels assured that <i>that</i> attitude does not mark any of us here tonight.<a name=29:7></a> One would assume that we all are prepared to hear what the Lord has to say to us.<a name=29:8></a> There may be some gatherings in the religious world where it would be very disturbing for the Lord Jesus to come personally into their midst, but one would trust that no local company represented here is in such a state.<a name=29:9></a> Indeed, the very basis on which we profess to come together is that we expect the presence of divine Persons - that we welcome the Lord Jesus into our midst and recognise the presence of the Holy Spirit.<a name=29:10></a> And the Lord Jesus <i>does</i> come: "There am I in the midst of them" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#18:20">Matthew  18:20</a>).<a name=29:11></a> And as coming in He would come in to bless!<a name=29:12></a> This, of course, may involve adjustment

		so that we can receive the blessing, but His primary interest is to bless His people.<a name=30:1></a> So that in reading these verses tonight it is to see <i>how</i> Jesus does things.<a name=30:2></a> The Scriptures are full of instruction with regard to moral adjustment, but the Lord's service in this respect in Mark's gospel is particularly instructive.<a name=30:3></a> Therefore we can find in the movements of Jesus instruction as to the basis on which we should move in any little service which it may be our privilege to undertake.<a name=30:4></a>

		Now, we all know that Mark himself had come under the adjusting hand of the Lord Jesus.<a name=30:5></a> He had failed in service.<a name=30:6></a> But who has not?<a name=30:7></a> One would humbly say that there are few who have not failed in service time and again in a greater or lesser degree.<a name=30:8></a> But it is a wonderful thing to have the experience of the adjusting service of the Lord and to be able to speak with feeling of the perfect way in which He brings it about.<a name=30:9></a> This is one of the keys to Mark's gospel.<a name=30:10></a> The details in it are intended to help us.<a name=30:11></a>

		is no freshness, no life, and therefore his service is marked by lack of power.<a name=31:1></a> It were better not to serve under these conditions.<a name=31:2></a> We cannot serve in power if we are not subject to Christ as the Head of the assembly.<a name=31:3></a> And so the Lord Jesus says, "Rise up".<a name=31:4></a> He has in mind that the man should be in the midst, where everybody can see him.<a name=31:5></a> For not only is the healing of the man in view, but there is also the question of getting this instruction into our souls so that we, too, will know how to do the right thing.<a name=31:6></a> We are all to profit by it.<a name=31:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But at once there is opposition.<a name=31:8></a> Why?<a name=31:9></a> Because they claim the Lord is spoiling the sabbath.<a name=31:10></a> There may be a condition like this in a meeting.<a name=31:11></a> Rather than stir up any trouble, the condition is allowed to go on and on.<a name=31:12></a> But the Son of man is Lord of the sabbath.<a name=31:13></a> If we are to come into true, restful, sabbath conditions, it must be as under His lordship.<a name=31:14></a> And He will not be satisfied to allow withered conditions to remain unadjusted.<a name=31:15></a> He told this man to stand forth and He raised a question as to principle: "Is it lawful on the sabbath to do good or to do evil?<a name=31:16></a>" - and they did not answer Him.<a name=31:17></a> It probably was not like them to not say anything.<a name=31:18></a> No doubt they had plenty to say before.<a name=31:19></a> But now they are brought to face the matter <i>according to principle</i>.<a name=31:20></a> The thing is not done arbitrarily.<a name=31:21></a> It is to be considered according to principle; there is to be a moral basis upon which it is worked out.<a name=31:22></a> If it is right, then do it!<a name=31:23></a> Certainly we do not wish to keep sabbath conditions if they have no right moral basis.<a name=31:24></a> If there is need for adjustment, let us bring the Lord into the matter.<a name=31:25></a> So the Lord tells the man to stretch forth his hand.<a name=31:26></a> He is now under the authority of Christ, and

	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		when adjustment is complete he will be marked by freshness as coming under that authority; under the control of the Head.<a name=32:1></a> He stretches forth the hand and it is healed.<a name=32:2></a> The Lord Jesus would thus indicate the moral need of being kept under His authority in our service; otherwise, as being out of the vital flow of supply from the living Head, we will lack freshness and life in our service.<a name=32:3></a> This is a comparatively simple case.<a name=32:4></a> It is brought forward by Mark as a fundamental case, but as he proceeds he brings in more difficult ones.<a name=32:5></a> But let us hold to this sense of the need of coming under the authority of Christ, because any service or activity apart from that must necessarily lack life and power.<a name=32:6></a>

		In the next passage we are introduced to a man who is not in the synagogue, which is a local idea, but who is in the district of Decapolis.<a name=32:7></a> "And they bring to him a deaf man who could not speak right".<a name=32:8></a> He is a brother who is in touch with other meetings, for Decapolis represents a place of ten cities, and therefore this man is related to an area or a district.<a name=32:9></a> It is not necessarily that he moves from city to city, but he is in touch with what is transpiring and is liable to have an influence for good or bad in other places besides his local meeting.<a name=32:10></a> He is deaf and has an impediment in his speech.<a name=32:11></a> There is something wrong, but the Lord is always ready to adjust what is wrong, if a moral basis is established on which He can act.<a name=32:12></a> He will come in on a righteous basis.<a name=32:13></a> This brother's condition was a concern to the brethren and they asked the Lord to lay His hand on him and heal him.<a name=32:14></a> But the Lord would have us understand that things are not done just that way.<a name=32:15></a> He would have us form a

		right judgment of the things that <i>caused</i> the condition.<a name=33:1></a> He would have us pray intelligently in the matter.<a name=33:2></a> And so instead of just laying His hand upon him, He leads him away from the crowd and then puts His fingers into his ears and spits and touches his tongue.<a name=33:3></a> Now this is all a matter of detail, but important detail.<a name=33:4></a> It is a question of how things are done, so that if we have a case like this we will know how to pray about it.<a name=33:5></a> It involves much more than laying a hand on him.<a name=33:6></a> The Lord Jesus put His fingers to the man's ears.<a name=33:7></a> Not one ear, but two.<a name=33:8></a> I believe the touching of the ears would suggest that this man is to have <i>balanced</i> hearing.<a name=33:9></a> We are very much in need of this kind of hearing.<a name=33:10></a> If we are in touch with the testimony in ten cities, we must have balanced hearing; otherwise we will hear but one side of a matter, and that will lead to all kinds of trouble.<a name=33:11></a> We must hear both sides of a matter before we can form a proper judgment.<a name=33:12></a> How much trouble results from unbalanced hearing!<a name=33:13></a> God, in creation, indicates the need for balanced hearing in that He has given man two ears.<a name=33:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And then the Lord spits; suggesting that a divine Person has come down into lowly, humble circumstances - indeed circumstances of shame.<a name=33:15></a> But in that humble pathway it could be said of Him, in the Spirit, "Ears hast thou prepared me" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#40:6">Psalm  40:6</a>).<a name=33:16></a> That word, quoted in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:5">Hebrews  10:5</a> is rendered, "Thou hast prepared me a body".<a name=33:17></a> That indicates, I believe, the intensity of His listening.<a name=33:18></a> His ear was wakened to hear as the instructed, Isaiah says.<a name=33:19></a> His one intent, or purpose, was to hear the voice of God.<a name=33:20></a> Thus He could say to the tempter that man shall not live by bread alone, but by <i>every word</i> of God.<a name=33:21></a> Truly, He could say,

		"Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#119:105">Psalm  119:105</a>).<a name=34:1></a> But if our ears are tuned in to that which comes from the many voices that are in the world, it will be difficult to have them attuned to God's voice morning by morning.<a name=34:2></a> The use of the ears is one example that the Lord has set for us in His manhood here.<a name=34:3></a> And so, it is not just a matter of laying hands on this man, for He also touches his tongue; but not before He spits; it is after He has spit.<a name=34:4></a> How suggestive these things are!<a name=34:5></a> It is not now a matter of calling attention to what is instructive in creation.<a name=34:6></a> Nature teaches us, truly, but here He touches the man's tongue after having spit, to indicate, I believe, that his speaking is now to be in subjection to the One by whose touch his tongue is released.<a name=34:7></a> The Lord Jesus could say, "As the Father has taught me I speak these things" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#8:28">John  8:28</a>).<a name=34:8></a> It is controlled speaking that is in view here.<a name=34:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the Lord Jesus lifts His eyes to heaven and groans, indicating that this adjustment requires not merely power, but depth of feeling is involved.<a name=34:10></a> It is not a sigh, but a groan.<a name=34:11></a> It suggests how we are to enter feelingly into matters requiring adjustment, like Timothy would, of whom it is said that he cared with genuine feeling.<a name=34:12></a> But more than this, it gives us some little sense of how Jesus has <i>borne</i> our infirmities.<a name=34:13></a> It is a question of what is involved in bringing about adjustment; the great detail of it; the depth of feeling and pressure to be entered into in such cases.<a name=34:14></a> It is not merely a touch of power.<a name=34:15></a> And so, this man is adjusted; he can move in the district of ten cities with balanced hearing.<a name=34:16></a> And when he speaks, his words will carry weight; they will be balanced words.<a name=34:17></a> He will be a good district man.<a name=34:18></a>

		Now, in the next case we have a man that is blind.<a name=35:1></a> Well, we might say, this is a simple case.<a name=35:2></a> Some such cases seem to be simple.<a name=35:3></a> Mark tells us of another blind man who sat by the wayside begging, whose recovery seems to be a very simple case.<a name=35:4></a> But that man saw far more than the crowd that was following Jesus.<a name=35:5></a> He discerned that the Man that was going up to the cross at Jerusalem was the One who had the right to the throne.<a name=35:6></a> Jesus said, "What wilt thou that I shall do to thee?<a name=35:7></a>" And the blind man said to him, "Rabboni, that I may see".<a name=35:8></a> And Jesus said to him, "Go, thy faith has healed thee.<a name=35:9></a> And he saw immediately, and followed him in the way" (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#10:51">Mark  10:51</a>, 52).<a name=35:10></a> But the man we are considering here is not a case like that.<a name=35:11></a> This man is in Bethsaida, one of the cities upon which the Lord Jesus had pronounced great woes: "Woe to thee, Chorazin!<a name=35:12></a> woe to thee, Bethsaida!<a name=35:13></a> for if the works of power which have taken place in you had taken place in Tyre and Sidon, they had long ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10:13">Luke  10:13</a>).<a name=35:14></a> It is a curse - governmental pronouncement has been uttered upon Bethsaida.<a name=35:15></a> No wonder the man is blind!<a name=35:16></a> He represents the case of one who has no regard for disciplinary action.<a name=35:17></a> He is blind to it.<a name=35:18></a> There has been assembly discipline, you might say, and he is blind in relation to it.<a name=35:19></a> But the feelings of the people of God are expressed week after week for him at the prayer meeting.<a name=35:20></a> There is constant appeal for his recovery.<a name=35:21></a> It says, "They bring him a blind man, and beseech him that he might touch him".<a name=35:22></a> Again there seems to be a lack of comprehension of what is involved in recovery.<a name=35:23></a> They say, in principle, We have been praying for him for a long time.<a name=35:24></a> But what had

		We will do damage to the Lord's work if we do that, for the case may be such that more than one touch is necessary.<a name=37:1></a> In this case the Lord Jesus spit upon the eyes that were to be healed.<a name=37:2></a> I believe it involves that he is to be helped to see by direct application of what was involved in the downstooping grace of Jesus.<a name=37:3></a> There was to be imparted an impression of the character of Man who stooped so low in grace to set aside man after the order of flesh and blood.<a name=37:4></a> It is perfectly evident that he had the wrong kind of man in view.<a name=37:5></a> That, evidently, had been his basic trouble.<a name=37:6></a> Now Jesus asks him if he sees aught.<a name=37:7></a> He is working in this brother, as we may call him, who had been under disciplinary action, in order to get him to judge the root error.<a name=37:8></a> He asks him what he sees, and the answer is, "I behold men, for I see them, as trees, walking".<a name=37:9></a> Now, that is a good start.<a name=37:10></a> The first use of opened eyes is to see where we have been wrong and to reach a right judgment of our course.<a name=37:11></a> It is not yet the ability to see what was in that lowly Man who walked here - who moved in lowly dependence upon His God - whose every move was under the control of the will of God, and yet He Himself God.<a name=37:12></a> But he has arrived at a judgment of the root error and he can speak about it.<a name=37:13></a> He says, in principle, I see that I had <i>men</i> before me - men who were out of true proportion in my mind.<a name=37:14></a> Then, you might say, he is ready for fellowship now.<a name=37:15></a> But no!<a name=37:16></a> the process has not been completed yet.<a name=37:17></a> It is good to have eyes opened to see the point of departure and to judge what brought in the blindness, but it is also necessary that the moral glories of the Lord Jesus shine into the soul to hold it as an anchorage against a repetition of the error.<a name=37:18></a>

		It is before me to speak a word on spiritual substance in the believer.<a name=41:1></a> One of the great features of the present moment is God's operations amongst the saints to augment this.<a name=41:2></a> He is using circumstances which, under the hand of the enemy, might hinder the work and retard development of what is for Him, to bring about enlargement in this great matter of spiritual substance.<a name=41:3></a> Christianity is not something ethereal; it lies in substance and has been presented to us in a glorious Person, the Lord Jesus Christ, in blessed substantiality.<a name=41:4></a> In Luke's gospel it is written of Him, as coming into the world, "The holy thing also which shall be born" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:35">Luke  1:35</a>).<a name=41:5></a> "<i>The holy thing</i>!<a name=41:6></a>" John's epistle speaks of that which we have handled.<a name=41:7></a> Both speak of the substantial side of Christianity, as expressed in Christ personally.<a name=41:8></a> I want to speak of it tonight as seen in a man of like passions as ourselves, so that we might be affected by it and take inventory to see whether we are marked by this substantiality of Christianity as seen in a vessel like Paul, or is our knowledge of God in mere words and thoughts of the mind?<a name=41:9></a> One loves to turn to this great vessel to whom was committed the great service of completing the word of God; as though God in committing the ministry of the assembly to him loves to bring to our attention the substantial side of His work, the product of real spiritual

		In the previous epistle the apostle spoke to his child Titus in relation to a set of different conditions, showing how balance marked him.<a name=47:5></a> In the epistle to Titus he does not bring in the tenderness of love's expressions, nor the personality that he brings in in the epistle to Philemon.<a name=47:6></a> He says, for example, "For there are many and disorderly vain speakers and deceivers of people's minds" (<a href="../bible/Titus.htm#1:10">Titus  1:10</a>).<a name=47:7></a> He uses no uncertain language in dealing with principles of evil.<a name=47:8></a> There is no use of saying we must pour in the tenderness of the system in dealing with evil: there must be balance.<a name=47:9></a> He says, "Who must have their mouths stopped" (verse 11).<a name=47:10></a> And again he says, "For which cause rebuke them severely" (verse 13).<a name=47:11></a> In such conditions we have Zenas the lawyer and Apollos mighty in the Scriptures brought in, but when we come to Philemon, it is not Zenas the lawyer or Apollos mighty in the Scriptures.<a name=47:12></a> You do not secure a brother by arguing the pros and cons of the case merely.<a name=47:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, Ahaz was surrounded by all this help and when the prophet spoke to him he would not ask for a sign from God.<a name=56:8></a> It seemed rather pious.<a name=56:9></a> Taking the matter casually we might say that Ahaz was a pious man.<a name=56:10></a> But let us look into the matter.<a name=56:11></a> What underlies this pious expression?<a name=56:12></a> Does it mean anything?<a name=56:13></a> "Ardent lips, and a wicked heart, are as an earthen vessel overlaid with silver dross" (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#26:23">Proverbs  26:23</a>).<a name=56:14></a> Laban was like that.<a name=56:15></a> He says to Jacob, "Thou art indeed my bone and my flesh" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#29:14">Genesis  29:14</a>); it was a pious utterance indeed, but it must be weighed.<a name=56:16></a> We must not be casual.<a name=56:17></a> While we are to have confidence in one another and we <i>must</i> have confidence in one another, yet we are to have a judgment about each.<a name=56:18></a> And what does this amount to in regard to Ahaz?<a name=56:19></a> As we go into his history we find that he removed the lavers from off the bases and took the sea from off the brazen oxen in God's house.<a name=56:20></a> He was the kind of brother that would do away with the purifying and cleansing processes.<a name=56:21></a> No wonder he did not avail himself of the upper pool or the fuller's field!<a name=56:22></a> That kind of person cannot receive the help which is from God for he does not want it.<a name=56:23></a> He interfered with the great administration of cleansing and purifying; and although surrounded by help

		These three scriptures will suffice to introduce the subject in mind, which is: another way, another man and another world.<a name=59:1></a> As together we have been enjoying real Christianity through the ministry, pure ministry from God and from Christ by the Spirit, which has affected each one of us.<a name=59:2></a> Our minds have been set in motion in the way of making holy committals to be more heavenly, and our affections have been stirred by the Spirit of God so that these holy matters shall be in our souls, not only in our minds, as we have had it, but in our souls, in our affections, our emotions moved by the great truths of Christianity.<a name=59:3></a> So that these scriptures came to mind to speak of tonight with a view that all of us here should be happy and restful and satisfied.<a name=59:4></a> God has introduced a system by which the human heart can be perfectly satisfied.<a name=59:5></a> There is no lack in that system.<a name=59:6></a> There is no need to go outside it for satisfaction.<a name=59:7></a> It is perfect and complete.<a name=59:8></a>

		So I would speak first on another <i>way</i>.<a name=59:9></a> There are many ways in the world, some dark and devious and corrupt, but Christianity involves one way: <i>the</i> way.<a name=59:10></a> A synonym of Christianity in the book of Acts is, "The way".<a name=59:11></a> There were those who were of the way.<a name=59:12></a> So that James says of Rahab that "she had received the messengers and put

		them forth by another way".<a name=60:1></a> The geography of that way is not recorded in this epistle, but it is a spiritual way.<a name=60:2></a> It is not an ordinary way, as Christianity is not an ordinary way.<a name=60:3></a> It is different; it is another, and yet withal it is "the way".<a name=60:4></a> So the Spirit of God through James records this great matter, that having received the messengers she put them forth by another way.<a name=60:5></a> In actual history, as you will remember, these two spies came to her house on the wall.<a name=60:6></a> They came to spy out Jericho.<a name=60:7></a> Great matters were in hand though obscurely performed, and yet not so obscurely that the enemy did not discern their coming; but he did not discern their going.<a name=60:8></a> He saw them coming but he did not see them go because the going back involves another way; and one trusts we might get help tonight on our goings back, that we might return another way.<a name=60:9></a> The messengers were going back; the eunuch, in the second scripture read, was going back, and now the inquiry tonight is, How are you and I going back?<a name=60:10></a> How are we returning?<a name=60:11></a> What did we have in mind in coming?<a name=60:12></a> Was it some social contact, or was it with the desire that we might be helped in this time of help when the windows of heaven are opened?<a name=60:13></a> As we have had it in these meetings, there is excess of grace that is operating towards us to help us on the heavenly line.<a name=60:14></a> She sent them forth another way.<a name=60:15></a> What comes to light as they were in her home is that she hid them, and that is the test of this other way: being hidden.<a name=60:16></a> Christianity involves hiding.<a name=60:17></a> True Christianity involves being hidden.<a name=60:18></a> This is the hidden way; the vulture's eye has not seen it; the lion's whelp has not trodden it; but, dear brethren, it is God's way.<a name=60:19></a> If I seek a reputation in it and seek a name in it, that is just the ordinary way, the world's

	<div class="paragraph">
		way.<a name=61:1></a> The way of prestige and of fame is to be seen and to be acclaimed, but this way is the way out of the world through Jordan.<a name=61:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So it says in Joshua that Rahab hid the messengers under the stalks of flax.<a name=61:3></a> The basic idea was there in her house; the basic element of purity was there even with such an one, and as the matter proceeds we discover that not only has she flax but she has a cord.<a name=61:4></a> The basic material now is being utilised.<a name=61:5></a> It is a cord to let the messengers down.<a name=61:6></a> It is part of the way; the men were <i>hidden</i>, they were <i>let down</i> and they were <i>sent</i>.<a name=61:7></a> She sent them to the mountains to hide three days - it is a Colossian position.<a name=61:8></a> She was taking on the features of a Colossian saint.<a name=61:9></a> She had the idea of being hidden, and that is one of the most fundamental teachings, I believe, dear brethren, in the Christian position, that we are not seeking to be great in this world; we are not seeking advancement unduly.<a name=61:10></a> If my work is thoroughly done and I come under the observation of my employer and he advances me, that is one thing; but we are not living, studying and anxious that we shall make a mark here.<a name=61:11></a> The "other way" would repudiate such a thought.<a name=61:12></a> It is to hide; it is to cross the Jordan; it is to be identified with Christ in His death.<a name=61:13></a> It is being hidden with Him; to come up with Him, indeed; to appear now in another light and in another world.<a name=61:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So these spies return another way; and these meetings, I believe, have tended towards this line.<a name=61:15></a> We have, I trust, a different outlook; we are not looking towards the world.<a name=61:16></a> Our faces are not set towards Egypt, or even towards the earth.<a name=61:17></a> There has been a change, another way has been

		opened up to us: the way of surpassing excellence, indeed, the way of love.<a name=62:1></a> It is a hidden way.<a name=62:2></a> These meetings have not been published in the newspapers, nor our comings together.<a name=62:3></a> There is no idea of delegates, no idea of publicity.<a name=62:4></a> That is the ordinary way, but Christianity is the spiritual way, another line, and so Jericho comes down.<a name=62:5></a> The hidden way really reduces the world.<a name=62:6></a> That is, it does not do it now publicly, but to faith the world has been brought down.<a name=62:7></a> They say, 'We cannot understand you', or 'You are not like other people'.<a name=62:8></a> Nor should a Christian be like other people; not that we study to be different or peculiar; that dishonours Christ; but then, our objects are different.<a name=62:9></a> Our objects are in another world, connected with another order of man, and there is reproach on the name of Christ here.<a name=62:10></a> If one of His professed followers is just like one of the world, following in the way of the world, that never brings the world down; he may go down with it.<a name=62:11></a> Saved, as it says, so as by fire.<a name=62:12></a> But the sequel of this way involves that the world is brought down and that is in truth just what happens for faith.<a name=62:13></a> The world is reduced.<a name=62:14></a> Is it so?<a name=62:15></a> Is it really so to us tonight that the world, to faith, has been brought down?<a name=62:16></a> That Jericho has been brought down?<a name=62:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, there must be more than the way.<a name=62:18></a> Christianity, as I said, affords scope for the renewed mind to operate.<a name=62:19></a> To the new man Christ is everything and in all.<a name=62:20></a> So the eunuch was returning too.<a name=62:21></a> He had come up to Jerusalem to worship and now he is returning.<a name=62:22></a> It says that he was reading.<a name=62:23></a> "And the passage of the scripture which he read was this: He was led as a sheep to slaughter, and as a lamb is dumb in presence of him that shears him, thus he

		Well, in closing I would like to impress on our hearts the blessedness of another way - the spiritual way, which gives freshness to us as Christians here, who are led by the Spirit, and then that that other Man whose personal glory burst upon the soul of the eunuch may be seen in increasing measure in our manner of life and conversation, and that we may be truly at home in that other world which is available to us in upper-room conditions where those who love our Lord Jesus are engaged with what is heavenly.<a name=70:11></a> May the Lord bless the word.<a name=70:12></a>

		In the further scripture in Daniel we have opened windows.<a name=73:2></a> Daniel's window implies spiritual feelings and affections.<a name=73:3></a> What God is doing in regard of universal matters is reflected in spiritual feelings in the household.<a name=73:4></a> His were difficult circumstances, like ours today.<a name=73:5></a> The testimony was in reproach.<a name=73:6></a> And we are in reproach!<a name=73:7></a> Our households cannot be classified as belonging to the world.<a name=73:8></a> God has placed light in our dwellings, and we find ourselves in a position of reproach.<a name=73:9></a> Daniel knew reproach.<a name=73:10></a> It means suffering, and Daniel knew it.<a name=73:11></a> In such a day our houses are to be marked by an increased spirit of prayer.<a name=73:12></a> "And when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and, his windows being open in his upper chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled on his knees three times a day, and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime".<a name=73:13></a> Think of what that means!<a name=73:14></a> His upper chamber, and opened windows.<a name=73:15></a> It was an open matter.<a name=73:16></a> The idea of what is 'opened' is wonderful.<a name=73:17></a> These windows of Daniel's were never shut.<a name=73:18></a> His outlook was toward Jerusalem, although accepting the government of God that His people were where they were.<a name=73:19></a> We need right assembly feelings in our prayers; feelings for the people of God, not only in our own city, but wherever the interests of God are.<a name=73:20></a> God's people are in reproach, and I own them as my people.<a name=73:21></a>

		Dear sisters, I appeal to you tonight.<a name=89:2></a> Few have husbands who do not err, but here is a wonderful means of healing and recovery that may operate in every sister relative to her husband - the grace of life, the spirit of it.<a name=89:3></a> He comes into the house and takes account of his wife - that sister imbued with the Spirit - going about her duties in power, ministering to her husband.<a name=89:4></a> What an honour, what a dignity!<a name=89:5></a> And furthermore Peter says that "they may be gained without the word by the conversation of the wives, having witnessed your pure conversation carried out in fear".<a name=89:6></a> We brothers are often unwise, but there is perfect safety in this formula, dear sisters.<a name=89:7></a> You will never err on this line.<a name=89:8></a> No one will catch you in your words in this manner of life.<a name=89:9></a> It is the grace of life, and your erring husband, taking account of that and being held by it, will be recovered, not only as a husband but recovered to the assembly.<a name=89:10></a> Think of a sister with the ability to recover her husband to the truth of the assembly and all that that means!<a name=89:11></a> Would a husband not value such a wife?<a name=89:12></a> Indeed he would!<a name=89:13></a> What would God think of such a wife, of such a sister?<a name=89:14></a> Peter tells us - the adorning, the furnishings, which in the sight of God are of great price.<a name=89:15></a> Precious furnishings indeed!<a name=89:16></a> And then it goes on to say, "Whose adorning let it not be that outward one of tressing of hair, and wearing gold, or putting on apparel; but the hidden man of the heart".<a name=89:17></a> This word is to sisters: "The hidden man of the heart!<a name=89:18></a>" A sister may have a husband, but she has a hidden Man in her heart, none greater than He!<a name=89:19></a> It is what governs

	<div class="paragraph">
		So it speaks of "the incorruptible ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which in the sight of God is of great price".<a name=90:3></a> Does it not afford encouragement to you, dear sister, that the grace of life operating in relation to your husband can afford something for the heart of God?<a name=90:4></a> Is that not wonderful?<a name=90:5></a> The grace of life operating in the sisters, moving in recovery, and resulting in brothers being preserved in obedience to the truth must be of value in the sight of God.<a name=90:6></a> What valuation have we put on it in its operations in the sisters who are wives?<a name=90:7></a> I would encourage and stimulate their hearts in the service, having Christ in mind, the hidden Man of the heart, to bring out assembly features in us who are husbands.<a name=90:8></a> The grace of life operates over against the principle of what is dead; it is the Spirit of God operating through us in what we do as well as what we say.<a name=90:9></a>

		So that in this first scripture we are considering there is the uprising of Sheba the son of Bichri.<a name=123:2></a> I suppose it is instructive that as soon as the matter of Absalom is completed, this matter of Sheba the son of Bichri arises, as indicating, perhaps, that we are not to look for or expect rest in a scene where there will always be militant exercises as long as the assembly is here in responsibility.<a name=123:3></a> That, I apprehend, is one great gain of the weekly city reading that is being so happily taken up in a universal way, in the spirit of subjection to light.<a name=123:4></a> That is to say, it is a militant matter, and the Lord would strengthen the saints so that exercises might be met; that our souls might be formed in the truth, and thus we might be helped in our responsible setting in the light of the assembly here.<a name=123:5></a> But Sheba arises and it is a difficult matter.<a name=123:6></a> Joab would have met it according to his own ideas, but he was a ruthless man, and ruthlessness is not compatible with love.<a name=123:7></a> There is no need for weakness because of the absence of ruthlessness, and Joab's conduct here, one would submit, was ruthless in character.<a name=123:8></a> Indeed,

		David challenged the heart of Mephibosheth and in so doing he brought to light what was there.<a name=136:1></a> David also had to do with Shimei; but when Shimei comes David does not challenge him at all; he makes his speech, but at the end of it David simply says to him, "Thou shalt not die".<a name=136:2></a> But it is remarkable how he challenges Mephibosheth and how the challenge drew out the love that he had for the king.<a name=136:3></a> So the Lord would help us as to what He Himself has worked out in us for His pleasure; each fresh challenge to our hearts would simply serve to bring out what is pleasurable to Him.<a name=136:4></a> The way in which Mephibosheth addresses himself to the king is remarkable.<a name=136:5></a> He says in verse 28, "For all my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king; and thou didst set thy servant among them that eat at thine own table".<a name=136:6></a> What a deep-seated appreciation and value of the saints!<a name=136:7></a> It is especially important that every one of us, particularly those who are younger, be able to value, as inseparable, the Lord Jesus and the saints.<a name=136:8></a> The Lord loves to have us value the saints as being set among them.<a name=136:9></a> They are His own sovereign selection and that for His pleasure.<a name=136:10></a> Mephibosheth indicates in his way of speaking of his father's house that he had appreciated grace, because it was a matter of grace in David.<a name=136:11></a> Grace had been shown to Mephibosheth, for he had been given a place at David's table.<a name=136:12></a> So, in these conditions, the Spirit of God tells us how the man conducted himself in the absence of the king.<a name=136:13></a> He shows his appreciation of the grace that had been shown him and the favoured place in which he had been set, but he especially makes a point of the value of the saints, "them that eat at thine own table".<a name=136:14></a> One feels we need to be

		Now I read in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15">1 Corinthians  15</a>of what is called <i>the</i> end.<a name=157:3></a> Obviously a final idea is in mind, and I want to speak about that.<a name=157:4></a> You will remember in the first chapter of John that the Spirit of God, in the early verses, gives us certain thoughts about the Lord Jesus, so that we might have a right understanding of His greatness and His glory, and hold Him rightly and reverently in our thoughts.<a name=157:5></a> It says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" (verse 1).<a name=157:6></a> Then in verse 2, "<i>He</i> was in the beginning with God".<a name=157:7></a> Now, so far as I understand that great and wonderful passage, the Spirit is giving us a measure of understanding of the greatness of Christ.<a name=157:8></a> We need a beginning for our thoughts; creatures need a beginning.<a name=157:9></a> It need not be a historical matter, and it would seem to be the divine intention to carry our thoughts back as far as the creature mind can go, even the mind of one who has the Spirit of God.<a name=157:10></a> But we touch, as it were, the infinite, we just touch it, we come to the border of it; for we are to know that "<i>He</i> was in the beginning with God".<a name=157:11></a> You notice the personal pronoun introduced in verse 2, as though to identify what is said with a Person, a glorious Person; and then the passage goes on to say "All things received being through him, and without him not one thing received being which has received being".<a name=157:12></a> Notice how the statement is strengthened by the negative, as though there is zeal on the part of the Spirit to exclude any idea in our minds that anything could be done without the Lord Jesus.<a name=157:13></a> He is before us as the One who exercises the almighty

		Then a little further down in the same chapter it says, "The Word became flesh, and dwelt among us (and we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father), full of grace and truth" (verse 14).<a name=158:3></a> What an intervention that was!<a name=158:4></a> Some of us were speaking today about interventions, how God has come in again and again in the supremacy of His own power, to effect His will in blessing, and to carry out the plans of His heart.<a name=158:5></a> What an intervention this was!<a name=158:6></a> Long periods of time had passed since the beginning spoken of in Genesis; much history had been enacted on the earth; but now, this was the greatest event, the greatest event that had ever happened on the earth, when the Word became flesh and dwelt among us.<a name=158:7></a> When that glorious Person whom we apprehend as the active Operator of all Godhead power came amongst men in a condition in which He could be seen; and He was not alone, as John speaks of Him, it was as an only-begotten with a father, full of grace and truth.<a name=158:8></a>

		are coming very near to God, if our thoughts are following these scriptures, and if we are near to God in the light of Christ and His greatness in our hearts, then we can understand what He says, "It is done".<a name=161:1></a> Does it not just mean that God Himself is the beginning, and God Himself is the end?<a name=161:2></a> The actual carrying out of things is a detail, the power to carry them out is there in divine Persons, and especially in the hands of Christ, to bring everything to eternal finality, where love, divine love, will be wholly at rest.<a name=161:3></a> Now I have tried to give a little impression of what is perhaps the longest span that Scripture speaks about; what Moses speaks of when he says, "From eternity to eternity thou art God" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#90:2">Psalm  90:2</a>); what another has described as a divine parenthesis in the midst of eternity; when the power of God was exercised in this great intervention, when our Lord Jesus came down to carry out all that was in the heart of God to do, and could say at the end of His life here, as John's gospel records it, "It is finished" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#19:30">John  19:30</a>).<a name=161:4></a> He would give us to understand that that particular matter was finished at that moment.<a name=161:5></a> Had He not told us we should not have known, for who could look into that great transaction between God and Christ on the cross, who could tell us how it progressed?<a name=161:6></a> It was between God and Christ, something that no creature eyes could look into, or understand, or speak about; but the Lord would give us to know that at that moment, that particular part of His work was finished.<a name=161:7></a> It is a great idea in Scripture, to understand when things are finished.<a name=161:8></a>

		I would like to speak of these three men, Moses and Daniel and Paul, as exercising great influence among the brethren, among the people of God, and especially as helping them to reach completion in certain lines of exercise.<a name=165:1></a> Likewise we, as being near the end of the assembly's time and being concerned about completing everything which we have to complete, may perhaps catch the spirit of these three men and be helped to influence one another, for good, for it must surely be said wherever there are brethren together, few or many, they do influence one another.<a name=165:2></a> Where divine love is operative and there is cleaving to the truth, the influence is for good, and it is to be calculated therefore that everything will be finished that should be.<a name=165:3></a> We hope to end well, but as at Corinth we may have to face some adverse influence working at times in a person or in persons, and the lesson for us is to allow for the necessity for self-judgment in ourselves.<a name=165:4></a> This all has to be thought of when we are contemplating the thought of influence amongst God's people.<a name=165:5></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		is Moses, and particularly what kind of a man is he under pressure, when there are difficulties?<a name=166:1></a> What we find is that Moses exhibits a wonderful spirit throughout the whole of his pathway, having in his mind always great thoughts of God and great thoughts of God's people.<a name=166:2></a> Indeed these two things always go together.<a name=166:3></a> It would hardly be an exaggeration to say that if we have poor thoughts of the saints it is likely we have poor thoughts of God.<a name=166:4></a> The two act and react upon one another; moreover, what is needed alongside of great thoughts of God and great thoughts of His people is small thoughts of oneself, all seen very happily in Moses, the man of God.<a name=166:5></a> The word used for man, as many will know, is <i>Ish</i>, meaning, I believe, that in all that Moses had to undertake, whether for good or correction, or in suffering or in victory, he always had the affectionate feelings of a man, as I might say, a husband.<a name=166:6></a> He had, as it were, God's feelings for His people.<a name=166:7></a> God says of them later, "I was a husband unto them" (<a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#31:32">Jeremiah  31:32</a>), and I believe Moses shines in this particular way as he shone in affection and real husbandly thoughts towards God's people.<a name=166:8></a> He would not be hard unless he had to be.<a name=166:9></a> We think of him as even hesitating to speak, "I am slow of speech" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#4:10">Exodus  4:10</a>) he says.<a name=166:10></a> Stephen says of him later, "mighty in his words and deeds" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7:22">Acts  7:22</a>), but he says of himself, "slow of speech".<a name=166:11></a> It was no doubt a thing which God helped him in, but that is what he says and that is what he meant.<a name=166:12></a> Think of the meekness of spirit too, which marked such an one, even under the most irritating circumstances of the whole people worshipping a golden calf, Moses going up to the mountain and saying he would

		pray for them, "Perhaps I shall make atonement for your sin", he says, (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#32:30">Exodus  32:30</a>).<a name=167:1></a> Think of being served, dear brethren, by a man like that.<a name=167:2></a> We have known the spirit of that in our day.<a name=167:3></a> Again when the people were calling out for flesh (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#11">Numbers  11</a>), Moses confesses that God had told him to carry all these people in his bosom, as a nursing father carried the suckling.<a name=167:4></a> Think of being served for forty years by a man of that spirit and being brought by such a man to the fringe of the heavenly land.<a name=167:5></a> We have been brought in just such spirit by many of those who have led and helped us; we have been brought now as it were to the very fringe of the land.<a name=167:6></a> We are in the plains of Moab, as we may say, our eyes lifted up across the Jordan thinking of the good land and the goodly mountain and Lebanon; we are thinking of heaven, the assembly being the anteroom to heaven; we are thinking of all that is heavenly now which we may say a man like Moses would help us to reach, reach in spirit, that which we are soon going to reach literally.<a name=167:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So we are led to think of the spirit of a man like Moses, how he would impress the greatness of the inheritance upon us, as Paul says in our day, that we have a holy calling, a heavenly calling, a high calling, the "calling on high of God in Christ Jesus" (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3:14">Philippians  3:14</a>).<a name=167:8></a> It is that kind of thing which Moses typically sets out, and with which he charges himself through many a wearisome year in the wilderness to bring us to at the end.<a name=167:9></a> So his blessing is beautiful, dear brethren; he is about to depart himself and he leads the brethren, as you might say, with great thoughts of God and His movements, and great thoughts of the saints.<a name=167:10></a> What a great God we have!<a name=167:11></a> God in His holy

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then these wonderful thoughts about the saints, not forgetting the place that Moses had amongst them, for there was never a lawgiver like him.<a name=168:10></a> The law here is not merely the enunciation of the ten commandments, it is that which the people of God are to live in.<a name=168:11></a> That is the heritage; nothing more happy than for us to find out what it is to live in the blessedness of the will of God, that good and

		We may well admire God's pattern in sonship in Christ, the blessedness of being in such a relationship, God rending the heavens at least three times to speak to His Son, saying not only "This is", but "<i>Thou</i> art my beloved Son" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#3:22">Luke  3:22</a>).<a name=170:1></a> God would speak thus in a way to show us that intimate relationships and love are entwined in this matter of sonship.<a name=170:2></a> He is calling, you might say, upon His sons to be released, saying to the north, "Give up", and to the south, "Keep not back", (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#43:6">Isaiah  43:6</a>).<a name=170:3></a> Literally this is a word for Israel, spiritually a word for us, God wanting us all released in the glory of sonship for Himself.<a name=170:4></a> So "let Reuben live, and not die; And let his men be few".<a name=170:5></a> There are many sons, but the word <i>few</i> is in the sense of quality.<a name=170:6></a> It is to point to the quality of God's sons, and it would be well as taking on the impress of the blessing of Moses the man of God that we should exercise ourselves to see that we are keeping the company of the best of God's people that we can find; those who walk in the light, the joy, the love, and the intelligence of God's sons.<a name=170:7></a> If we can find them, let us walk amongst them, for they are soon to cross over into the land.<a name=170:8></a> Moses has them thus first on his mind.<a name=170:9></a>

		I have read these three scriptures, dear brethren, because I wish to call attention to what was engaging the mind of the apostle Paul as he was approaching the end of his course here, for as we know, he was the minister of the assembly, and I think it is right to say that what was engaging the mind of the apostle Paul, as he drew near to the close of his history, may fittingly occupy the minds of the saints who compose the assembly, as we draw near to the end of our history.<a name=181:1></a>

		I have begun with the second epistle to Timothy, because that gives us the public position, that is to say the position of suffering.<a name=181:2></a> There is the position of suffering, and it is likely not to get less, but rather to get more as we draw near to the close; so the second epistle to Timothy is characterised by the thought of suffering, that idea entering into each one of the four chapters of the epistle, but the fact that suffering enters into the position is in no way intended to discourage, for all through the epistle the apostle sounds a note of victory and triumph, and indeed, beloved brethren, if we will think of it for a moment, it is essential that some element of suffering should enter into our position here, however little we may feel some of us have touched it as yet.<a name=181:3></a> It is essential that the element of suffering should enter

		But I must pass on, and in reading this passage in Ephesians what I had in mind was to point out that, as nearing the end of his course, Paul tells us that he is concerned about the mystery and about enlightening all as to it, and then moreover, having said that, he tells us how he prays in relation to it.<a name=189:3></a> We were hearing last night of Daniel as a praying man, and the importance and value of prayer, but here in this passage Paul comes before us as showing how earnestly he prays.<a name=189:4></a> But before that he speaks about the mystery, and the grace given to him to announce among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of the Christ, and to make all men see what is the administration of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world had been hid in God, who created all things.<a name=189:5></a> "That now", he says, "to the principalities and authorities in the heavenlies might be made known through the assembly the all-various wisdom of God".<a name=189:6></a> Earlier in the chapter he tells us that he desired that the Ephesians might know his intelligence in the mystery; that is, he would have us understand that he, at any rate, had intelligence in the mystery, which, he says, "in other generations has not been made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets in the power of the Spirit" (verse 5).<a name=189:7></a> It is now revealed, and Paul, at any rate, had remarkable intelligence as to it, intending to convey that there is no reason why we should not increase in understanding as to the mystery.<a name=189:8></a> I do not say that we are likely to have Paul's intelligence of it, but at the same time he wanted them to know the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		intelligence that he had, in order to show that it is not beyond the range of the saints.<a name=190:1></a> Indeed, he was concerned to enlighten all as to the administration of the mystery, and that we might have our eyes opened to see what there is on earth in the assembly, through which principalities and authorities in the heavenlies even now are learning the all-various wisdom of God, for, beloved brethren, it is God's masterpiece, the assembly.<a name=190:2></a> I am not speaking now of it abstractly or theoretically, but I am speaking of it as that which has concrete existence at this present time, and we ourselves are part of it.<a name=190:3></a> There is here on earth (and I say again we ourselves are part of it), that which is God's masterpiece in wisdom and love, a company drawn out from the nations, knit together, bound together in the power of the Holy Spirit in love amongst ourselves, and united in unified affection towards Christ in glory, and held in relation to Christ, so that He can speak of it, as He does, as my assembly.<a name=190:4></a> Whatever Satan may do contrary to the truth, there is that here, as held under the influence of Christ, and deriving wisdom from Him in whom all the fulness of the Godhead dwells bodily, which Satan cannot overcome.<a name=190:5></a>

		Now let us carry this thought forward into John's gospel.<a name=210:11></a> I would again call attention to the economy.<a name=210:12></a> The Persons of the Godhead are spoken of, and what is before the Spirit in this gospel is the economy, how God is known, how He is being seen in Persons of the Godhead so that men would understand the positions which They have taken up, One in relation to Another.<a name=210:13></a> You see how the economy is indicated here.<a name=210:14></a> The Son is the central figure in it, for it is a question of testimony.<a name=210:15></a> When it is a question of the service of God, the Father is the great object; but here it is the Son who is prominent.<a name=210:16></a> A little later on we are told that the Father loves the Son and has given all things to be in His hand.<a name=210:17></a> It is an economy of love.<a name=210:18></a> It is an excellent arrangement for operations, for the Lord Jesus is in a position in which He could die.<a name=210:19></a> He is near to men and can

	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:21">John  14:21</a>, I would again suggest that the economy is in operation, not so much in service but in its operations of pleasure, delight in men.<a name=212:2></a> A little earlier in the chapter the Lord speaks of the other Comforter.<a name=212:3></a> He says of Him, "That he may be with you for ever" (verse 16), so that that is a fixed matter.<a name=212:4></a> I do not know that that could ever change.<a name=212:5></a> So far as I see, it never could change because we are creatures and we need that Person in us for ever; it is an unchangeable condition.<a name=212:6></a> But now the other two Persons of the Godhead are spoken of in most affectionate terms.<a name=212:7></a> The Lord says, "He that has my commandments and keeps them, he it is that loves me; but he that loves me shall be loved by my Father, and I will love him and will manifest myself to him" (verse 21).<a name=212:8></a> Here we have again this beautiful idea of the glorious Persons of the Godhead, each and all entitled to worship and homage from men, but moving in love to come to one that loves Christ and keeps His word.<a name=212:9></a> All three of the Persons are involved in this, the Spirit with us and in us, and of the Father and the Lord Jesus it is said, "we will come" (verse 23); it is a plural matter.<a name=212:10></a> While it speaks of an individual, because John's gospel is written in that way, yet these chapters are collective in their teaching, and in the assembly there will be many such as are spoken of here, who love Christ and keep His word.<a name=212:11></a> His <i>word</i> is a finer thought than His <i>commandments</i>, and I believe that in speaking about divine Persons and in speaking about the matter that interests the brethren so much today, we need to get into this more refined realm of Christ's word.<a name=212:12></a> It is not

		so much a question of a command or order given which requires obedience, though that has its own place.<a name=213:1></a> If we are not obedient to His commandments we shall not be sensitive as to His word, but what I see in this is, that the economy is in operation in the way that divine love is ministered to by men, and the Persons of the Godhead, all of Them, three of Them, each one in a place taken, but each one is in this matter of love.<a name=213:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is love for Christ and the keeping of His word.<a name=213:3></a> As I said, the Lord Jesus is always the test, He is in the front of the position, but divine Persons are all in this matter.<a name=213:4></a> Now why should we leave the Spirit out of this?<a name=213:5></a> Should we not have it definitely in our minds that each divine Person is in this economy of love, and that each is entitled to be served according to the divine arrangement; not making any reserve in our minds, as to them, for the economy of love affords the greatest possible liberty for men to worship in spirit and in truth.<a name=213:6></a> <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24">Genesis  24</a>would show that one Person may be before our eyes at any given time.<a name=213:7></a> We have understood that; as we worship the Lord Jesus we have Him in our thoughts; but carry the conscious sense of the Spirit's presence.<a name=213:8></a> As we worship the Father, we understand that the Lord Jesus and the Spirit are with us, helping us, for without their help there could be no access to, or worship of, the Father.<a name=213:9></a> So all the Persons are before us, but each in an arranged place.<a name=213:10></a> God is thus known and we worship Him.<a name=213:11></a>

		In such great matters we would all seek to help each other, and the Spirit is here to guide us into all the truth.<a name=214:7></a> Only He knows all the truth.<a name=214:8></a> We have had great servants who have served the assembly, and we regard them highly for their service, but the only Servant who has been with the assembly from the beginning and will be with her to the end is this Servant of whom I have spoken, the blessed Spirit.<a name=214:9></a> He has carried every sorrow and has gone through every individual exercise and every assembly exercise, and finally, at the end, the assembly will be in full communion with Him, able to speak with Him and say to the Lord Jesus, "Come".<a name=214:10></a>

		It is on my heart and mind to refer to the assembly in the passages read, having certain specific thoughts in mind in relation to it.<a name=215:1></a> I wish to speak of unity in relation to the first, in which the assembly is viewed as the body; then of union in the passage in Ephesians where the assembly is viewed as the wife; and then of unison in the last scripture in relation to the Spirit and the bride.<a name=215:2></a> I have chosen these passages because of these great thoughts that are linked with them and are paramount at the present time.<a name=215:3></a> In a certain sense these thoughts flow out of one another and as we proceed we may see the distinctive place that the blessed Spirit has in relation to them.<a name=215:4></a> Although the Spirit is not mentioned in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5">Ephesians  5</a>we all know that union with Christ could not be apart from the Spirit.<a name=215:5></a> We have been helped and are constantly being helped as to the place that the Spirit should have and is now receiving in the minds and hearts of the saints.<a name=215:6></a> No doubt we shall be helped more as to this blessed Person, involving that, as knowing Him better, we may move in greater liberty with Him in all that He would do in filling out His great and glorious mission.<a name=215:7></a> It must be a wonderful thing to the blessed Spirit to have the assembly, a vessel in which He has particular right of way to do that for which He has come from heaven.<a name=215:8></a> He has been

		Now I want to refer to the thought of unity in the body which is drawn to our attention in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12">1 Corinthians  12</a>, having in mind that the Lord may help us to see its importance in our local settings.<a name=216:3></a> The Lord is not taking us on in any kind of way, nor is the Spirit taking on any kind of persons.<a name=216:4></a> Divine Persons are very selective in what they take on.<a name=216:5></a> From another viewpoint, of course, we do well to think of what they do take on in sovereign mercy.<a name=216:6></a> There is the side of the assembly in the wilderness with much that comes up to test us and to bring out expressions of the flesh in us, but what I wish to speak of now is the selectivity of divine operations.<a name=216:7></a> This side of things is particularly before us in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24">Genesis  24</a>in relation to the one who was to be united to Isaac.<a name=216:8></a> It is essential, dear brethren, in regard to the higher levels of the truth and our part and our place with Christ as united to Him in the heavenly domain, that we should give due and proper attention to the matter of unity here below in the presence of organised evil.<a name=216:9></a> There should be in our localities, as we walk in the light of the assembly in a place, a testimony to that to which God has committed Himself.<a name=216:10></a>

		position that marks God's assembly.<a name=217:1></a> We are tested by this and our unity as to it, but it is important that we make way for it because it has to do especially with the realm in which the blessed presidency of the Spirit is seen, reminding us that if unity is lacking there will be a hindrance to His operations.<a name=217:2></a> It is incumbent upon all of us that we make way for this matter of unity so that the enemy may find no means of thrusting in a wedge of divergence as the Lord brings forward the truth as to divine thoughts in their richness and fulness.<a name=217:3></a> The writer of this letter is a choice vessel himself, and he brings before us in the skill of his approach to the Corinthian saints the way in which he holds to what is committed to him and will not give up the ground for a moment.<a name=217:4></a> God is looking for that, not only in the apostle, but in persons who even in this day of brokenness have in their souls the light of all that has come out, in the apostle's ministry; persons who will hold the ground in spiritual and faithful tenacity, never yielding for a moment lest the dignity of the assembly should be in any way infringed upon.<a name=217:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is no ordinary matter that the saints should be set together in cities, and it is a great thing, dear brethren, that this basic thought of unity should be marking the position.<a name=217:6></a> It is not unity in the sense of compromising evil or forgetting differences where the truth is involved, or failing in the exposure of evil.<a name=217:7></a> Not for a moment!<a name=217:8></a> Let us remember the choice expression of a servant gone before that 'separation from evil is God's principle of unity'.<a name=217:9></a> We must always bear that in mind.<a name=217:10></a> The idea of unity is not the compromise of evil but is based upon separation from all

	<div class="paragraph">
		We can see from this letter the diverging thoughts that had come in amongst the brethren in Corinth and the skill of the apostle as he proceeded to take up matters and deal with them, especially having upon his spirit the fact that the enemy had sought to divide the saints in that city.<a name=218:5></a> Partisan schools existed - divided thoughts among the brethren - so that he began with that matter, even in the first chapter, for he was concerned about the state that had caused the divided thoughts and utterances, though he never forgets what they were abstractly according to the mind of God.<a name=218:6></a> He never gave up that ground for a moment; never yielded to the results of the enemy's work, however strongly he may have entrenched himself in the position, but holds to divine thoughts, as we should, always.<a name=218:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In referring to the emblems in connection with the Lord's supper, he draws attention to the great thought of unity.<a name=218:8></a> He speaks, in chapter 10, of the one loaf: "We, being many, are one loaf" (verse 17).<a name=218:9></a> Thus the testimony to unity is before us, we may say, week by week.<a name=218:10></a> But what I want to come to is that it is not just a matter of light; it involves a living organism which the body suggests and in which the blessed Spirit has a peculiar place and liberty.<a name=218:11></a> It involves a

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It may be that we do not care to <i>say</i> much, but inwardly we may diverge in our thoughts or in our hearts.<a name=219:6></a> But the drinking of the one Spirit has in mind that we are to be affected inwardly, in every part of our being, so that there is no obstruction anywhere in us to the one Spirit or to the unity which He would bring about in our localities.<a name=219:7></a> The baptism of the Spirit involves that native and national characteristics disappear.<a name=219:8></a> But how important it is that the Spirit should find no obstruction in us in this wonderful sphere into which He has come.<a name=219:9></a> The Lord Jesus became incarnate, which is not true of the Spirit, but in His coming, in the Spirit has constituted and formed this great vessel in which the sovereignty of His blessed ministration is to be known.<a name=219:10></a> Although there is refusal of divine rights on every hand His will is to be first in the assembly, and therefore it is important that we should be conscious of being of the one body, as it says, "For also in the power of one Spirit <i>we</i> have all been baptised into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bondmen or free, and have all been given to drink of one Spirit".<a name=219:11></a>

		The apostle is speaking of the thought of a body, involving nearness to one another, having living links together in this wonderful organism and being sensitive as to the place each other has.<a name=220:1></a> How important, therefore, that we should be lifted out of isolated individual thoughts into the greatness of these thoughts which involve a living spiritual organism held together by the one Spirit and forming one glorious entity.<a name=220:2></a> In the passages that we have read the assembly is taken account of as an entity, whether as the body, or as the wife or as the bride.<a name=220:3></a> What an entity the assembly is!<a name=220:4></a> And how fitted she is, through divine furnishing, to fill out any position in which she may be viewed!<a name=220:5></a> Well, it is for us to see whether the unity and the oneness that are referred to in this chapter are enjoyed by us and are in testimony in our localities.<a name=220:6></a> Are we near to one another or is there distance between us?<a name=220:7></a> Are we isolated in our thoughts from one another?<a name=220:8></a> The blessed Spirit has come into this vessel to operate in it, a vessel that is replete with spiritual feeling and spiritual sensibility.<a name=220:9></a> What a thing that is, dear brethren!<a name=220:10></a>

		This epistle to the Ephesians was written by the same apostle who wrote the Corinthian epistles, and he had particular liberty and freedom as he opened up the wealth of divine thoughts which are in the divine mind for us.<a name=222:4></a> It is in mind to bring us into this wonderful association with Christ, but our salvation from all that is connected with the scene down here is essential.<a name=222:5></a> There is to be salvation from the enemy's power, and how great his power is, and how important it is that we should know and enjoy salvation from it in the power of the Spirit.<a name=222:6></a> Then there is to be salvation from associations - oh, how ensnaring fleshly associations may become!<a name=222:7></a> That condition of things was dealt with unsparingly in the cross of Christ.<a name=222:8></a> How well it is for the young people to see the way that God has opened up to us, the blessedness of salvation from associations linked with the flesh.<a name=222:9></a> The only thing that God could do with the flesh was to put it out of His sight forever, and He has done that in the death of Christ.<a name=222:10></a> We linger a long time around it and attach much to it, but God would help us to see the importance of salvation from it.<a name=222:11></a> But then this letter opens up to us the blessedness of salvation from place - Rebecca left her father and mother, her country and all her kindred.<a name=222:12></a> She came to the place where Isaac was, and that is a great

		I have in mind, dear brethren, to say a word about the value of the brother.<a name=227:1></a> I do not, thereby, exclude the sisters, trusting that they will definitely include themselves in this matter because of the working out of the truth, but the scriptures that I have read actually refer to the thought of the brother.<a name=227:2></a> Hence my remarks may be largely connected with such a person, involving the family thoughts, for a brother clearly has a family connection, meaning that love is there.<a name=227:3></a> If we think of the spiritual family of God we begin at once to understand that God has not in mind so many units, working alone, and living alone, but He has a family in mind.<a name=227:4></a> And this is confirmed by the Scriptures, both literally, in the New Testament (Scripture speaking about the children of God and the sons of God, and the sons and daughters of the Father, the Lord Almighty), and also typically, as found in the family of Israel, and so on, in the Old Testament.<a name=227:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now it is a great thing to be able to seize a main thought in the Scripture, like that of the family of God, enabling us to connect the brother with the family, and especially with the family in love.<a name=227:6></a> This first verse that we read is the end of a good long passage where Paul is mentioning many celebrated persons, distinctive in God's

		world, the nobility of God's world.<a name=228:1></a> That is why, for the most part, they have names, and we may say, titles according to God.<a name=228:2></a> In short they have spiritual personality.<a name=228:3></a> It would be good if all of us here could be thus known in heaven as "approved in Christ" (verse 10), "minister of the assembly", "a helper of many" (verses 1, 2); these are qualifications which may pass for little in the religious world, but they are very valuable in heaven.<a name=228:4></a> Hence this chapter is full of personality, and we are not to be misled because in outward circumstances a brother is humbly set.<a name=228:5></a> We read elsewhere of Secundus; and Tertius and Quartus are mentioned in the verses I have read.<a name=228:6></a> It is quite likely they were just slaves, bondmen in the household or quarters where Paul was.<a name=228:7></a> They had not even a name, they were the third and the fourth in the household setting.<a name=228:8></a> But we are not to be misled by that, but to understand that they are known as heavenly personalities.<a name=228:9></a> Of Quartus, all that is said is that he is a brother, but we are to understand how this title resounds in God's family.<a name=228:10></a> Indeed, it says, "<i>the</i> brother".<a name=228:11></a> He is the last one mentioned in the list; not the least, however, for he actually comes nearest to what follows, namely, what Paul speaks of as "my glad tidings and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery" (verse 25); as if Paul would say, 'Now we have got a brother, we need delay no longer, we can go straight away into the mystery'.<a name=228:12></a> Has that fully struck us, how valuable a brother is, enabling such a one as Paul to think immediately of the mystery; that is, Christ and the assembly?<a name=228:13></a> Thus the mystery works out by the brother next to me, or the sister next to me; there is a suggestion in that person of the make-up of

		the assembly.<a name=229:1></a> The nearer Paul comes to the mystery the more he becomes jubilant.<a name=229:2></a> In Romans, having arrived at this great matter of the brother, he breaks off in real exhilaration, spiritual buoyancy, in his doxology in relation to the mystery.<a name=229:3></a> Prison, in the Colossian and Ephesian epistles, makes no difference.<a name=229:4></a> Directly he thinks of the mystery, Christ and the assembly, and all the treasures that are there, he becomes joyful.<a name=229:5></a> Does any thought of the assembly, of the mystery, come into our mind as we see a brother or a sister, or the brethren?<a name=229:6></a> Have we had any thoughts of the assembly before us as we have been together?<a name=229:7></a> Not merely one hundred or so brethren together, but have we some thought of the mystery, the assembly, the <i>whole thing</i>?<a name=229:8></a> Paul had, for he has only to look at a brother, and he is joyful.<a name=229:9></a> I commend that to you, dear brethren, the thought of <i>the</i> brother.<a name=229:10></a> It is a thought belonging to the family, it entails affection and it leads in the direction of the assembly.<a name=229:11></a>

		Moreover the Lord Jesus was pleased to signalise such a person.<a name=229:12></a> On one occasion they said that his mother and his brethren were seeking Him, meaning his literal brethren in the family, and Mary.<a name=229:13></a> But He pointed to <i>His disciples</i>, a hint that in this matter of the brother it is expected that there will be teaching taken on, that the brother will be teachable material, subject to the Lord.<a name=229:14></a> "Stretching out his hand to his disciples, he said, Behold my mother and my brethren; for whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in the heavens, he is my brother" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#12:49">Matthew  12:49</a>, 50).<a name=229:15></a> He did not mean His literal brother.<a name=229:16></a> There is no permission for us to call Christ our brother; that is quite wrong, and very

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing to have in mind is that if a person is a brother (and I include the sister) he is worth finding, and if he is not in his place, he is worth recovering.<a name=230:3></a> Some of our brethren who have been lost to us we cannot do much for, as they will not let us get very near.<a name=230:4></a> For some of them we are reduced largely to the matter of praying for them because of this.<a name=230:5></a> But the principle of faith means that the brother is always held as recoverable.<a name=230:6></a> It is an abnormality for a brother not to be recovered.<a name=230:7></a> Lot was lost; Abraham recovered him, using all his resources to do so.<a name=230:8></a> When he heard that his brother (not only his nephew but his <i>brother</i>) Lot had been taken captive, then he prepared his resources, his trained servants, and so on.<a name=230:9></a> He is the man of faith, the heavenly man, suggesting that faith never regards such a recovery as utterly beyond us.<a name=230:10></a> We are always on the line of recovery; it says, he "brought again his brother Lot" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#14:16">Genesis  14:16</a>).<a name=230:11></a> Now there is something in that for us to think about.<a name=230:12></a> I am not thereby negating the truth which says that there are those that perish, and that there are those that may not be recovered, but from the point of view of what marks us, we would have it in our minds that every lost one should be recovered.<a name=230:13></a> He is worth it, he is a brother.<a name=230:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now one of the early things which comes into a brother's mind is to help in the work of the Lord, in the testimony.<a name=230:15></a> Sometimes a brother has great thoughts about the testimony, and links himself on with it and suffers for it, like John.<a name=230:16></a> He never ceases to give expression to the

	<div class="page-number">

	<div class="paragraph">
		brotherly thought.<a name=231:1></a> "I John, your brother .<a name=231:2></a>.<a name=231:3></a>.<a name=231:4></a> was in the island called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:9">Revelation  1:9</a>).<a name=231:5></a> <i>Your brother</i>.<a name=231:6></a> The word 'was' means 'became'.<a name=231:7></a> I <i>became</i> in the island called Patmos.<a name=231:8></a> He was not always there, but there were circumstances which brought him there, and he began to be there.<a name=231:9></a> Once he was fishing; another time he was in the Lord's bosom; another time he was with Peter, before the Beautiful gate of the temple, but now he is in Patmos.<a name=231:10></a> But he never ceases to be a brother.<a name=231:11></a> "I John, your brother".<a name=231:12></a> That is, dear brethren, that we are always true, even in suffering, for "your brother" refers to the brotherhood.<a name=231:13></a> Peter speaks of it: "The selfsame sufferings are accomplished in your brotherhood which is in the world" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#5:9">1 Peter  5:9</a>), and it is exemplified in John.<a name=231:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a time when you begin to have an inkling that you should move in relation to the testimony.<a name=231:15></a> So these few verses I have read from Chronicles indicate how people began to move towards David, and they began when David's circumstances were very poor.<a name=231:16></a> That is, you will notice that the chapter begins, "Now these are they that came to David to Ziklag".<a name=231:17></a> It is not king David on the throne; there is no outward glory, and yet he is the anointed of God, but in rejection and in suffering, not in a palace, but in the open, in caves, strongholds, palisades, with a few men, but they came to him at that time.<a name=231:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is very interesting the way the Chronicles are recorded.<a name=231:19></a> Chapter 11 opens with king David being hailed by all Israel, and going to Jerusalem; it is fairly far on in David's history.<a name=231:20></a> But then the Spirit of God goes back and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=232>[Page 232]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		starts telling us about the persons who surrounded David; who made up his kingdom; supplied him with men.<a name=232:1></a> The Spirit of God says, "Now these are they that came to David", those who helped him in the conflict, and so on, armed with bows and using both the right hand and the left, with stones and with arrows on the bows.<a name=232:2></a> They were of Benjamin, Saul's tribe.<a name=232:3></a> They must have judged themselves, for Saul was not at all friendly to David.<a name=232:4></a> We see what is open to us as we judge ourselves, and judge connections which are inimical to David.<a name=232:5></a> We can be fully in the testimony.<a name=232:6></a> One of the troubles with many of us is that we let the dangers get too close to us, and we are not able to cope with them; there is no room to move.<a name=232:7></a> But if we can shoot an arrow, if we can sling a stone, we can keep enemies at a distance.<a name=232:8></a> There is much in that, in keeping the enemies at a distance, especially when it is in our mind, under the influence of the Spirit of God, to move towards David.<a name=232:9></a> Let his circumstances be what they may, our part is to come to David.<a name=232:10></a> If David is in a cave, let us go to the cave.<a name=232:11></a> If he is in Ziklag, let us go to Ziklag.<a name=232:12></a> If he is in the palace, let us go to the palace.<a name=232:13></a> It is the Beloved, David, the person who solves it all.<a name=232:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The first of these in this company is Ahiezer, which I understand means 'a helping brother'.<a name=232:15></a> And please God, that is to be each one of us, a helping brother, helping David in the testimony.<a name=232:16></a> Other things follow, as, for instance, the Gadites, who <i>separated</i> themselves, and the first one mentioned is Ezer, whose name means 'help'.<a name=232:17></a> It is a very interesting word; the first time it is referred to is in relation to the woman - the "helpmate" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:18">Genesis  2:18</a>).<a name=232:18></a> Think of

		Then there will come a time when David will test us, for in the third incident there were men of Judah and men of Benjamin coming together.<a name=233:9></a> The men of Judah would be dependable, for they were of David's tribe, but there was a time when the men of Benjamin had to be challenged.<a name=233:10></a> David said to them, "If ye come peaceably to me to help me".<a name=233:11></a> One man, Amasai, answered; indeed it says, the Spirit came upon him, a remarkable expression.<a name=233:12></a> The Spirit came upon the man so that he says, "Thine are we, David, and with thee, thou son of Jesse: Peace, peace be to thee!<a name=233:13></a> And peace be to thy helpers!<a name=233:14></a>" If we are really right with David we will have no difficulties with the brethren.<a name=233:15></a> We shall not be a source of irritation to the brethren, nor they to us.<a name=233:16></a> This carries its own conviction.<a name=233:17></a> We are helping the Lord (if you will allow the expression) in the testimony; then also we are to help one another.<a name=233:18></a>

		I have read from Judges to illustrate this last point.<a name=234:1></a> Historically, this goes into earlier days, though morally, it is always true.<a name=234:2></a> Joshua the leader had died; the great man who had helped and led was not available.<a name=234:3></a> Who knows what may be ahead of us, when some of the great men who have helped us are not available?<a name=234:4></a> It is for us to see what there is in the brethren for our help, what there is in the assembly.<a name=234:5></a> So here in this passage at a certain juncture in the conflict, the children of Israel cried to God.<a name=234:6></a> It is not Joshua telling them what to do, and as far as the record goes there was no judge yet risen up.<a name=234:7></a> They cried to God, and God gave the answer, "Judah shall go up: behold I have delivered the land into his hand".<a name=234:8></a> And then Judah took a hand, without any command, and said to Simeon, his brother, "Come up with me into my lot, and let us fight against the Canaanites, and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot; and Simeon went with him".<a name=234:9></a> Of course it is a very simple narrative, but a great many things come to light as brethren begin to help one another.<a name=234:10></a> For instance, Judah was a great brother with a mighty territory.<a name=234:11></a> God gave him a tremendous territory, and perhaps He had in mind that He would see what he would do with it.<a name=234:12></a> The fact is that Judah said, 'My territory is big; let Simeon come and live with me.<a name=234:13></a> I'll share my territory'.<a name=234:14></a> A very magnanimous action!<a name=234:15></a> Love would do that!<a name=234:16></a> And love was greater there, perhaps, than we think, because Judah was not only a great man, but a spiritual man, for when the children of Israel got over into the land, Judah came up amongst the first and claimed his inheritance.<a name=234:17></a> But as for Simeon, he came up a long time later, may I say, like most of us, a long while later, at the

		I wish to speak, dear brethren, of what God would have to be in our hearts.<a name=239:1></a> Firstly His desire is that the Christ should dwell in our hearts, through faith; and secondly there is the thought of Paul being in our hearts, as the one in whom, as a man of like passions to ourselves, the features of what is heavenly are set forth, so that he is presented in the Scriptures as one whom we are to imitate.<a name=239:2></a> And then finally the saints are to be in our hearts, as Paul says, "Ye are in our hearts, to die together, and live together".<a name=239:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, it is a great thing that the Christ should dwell in our hearts.<a name=239:4></a> We read in 2 Corinthians that God has given us the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts; that is a wonderful thing, because the earnest is more than mere light, it involves some substantial entering into the enjoyment of the things of Christianity, things which in their fulness and actuality are still future, but which may be known in a very considerable measure of present power and enjoyment in the Holy Spirit.<a name=239:5></a> It is a most touching thing that the Holy Spirit should take up His abode in us, in order to bring in our heavenly portion in a substantial way to be known while we are still in conditions of humiliation.<a name=239:6></a> In Ephesians the apostle prays that we might be "strengthened

	<div class="paragraph">
		This is of the greatest importance to us, dear brethren, not simply as a matter of having intelligence in the thoughts of God, though that is important, but because it has been given to us to live in the day in which the assembly is being formed.<a name=240:12></a> In that sense we are greater than Abraham, or Moses, or Daniel, or any of these great persons of whom we read in the Old Testament.<a name=240:13></a> Not that we would make anything of ourselves, it is just a question of what God in His sovereignty is pleased to make us, and what He has in

		mind to effect in this dispensation in which we are living.<a name=241:1></a> From that standpoint it is of the greatest importance that we should have an increasing understanding of what the assembly is according to the mind of God, because it is that which He is chiefly occupied with at the present time.<a name=241:2></a> It is a vessel immense in extent, in that it is taking God nearly two thousand years to form it, and it is embracing those of every nation under the sun.<a name=241:3></a> It is the masterpiece of God's wisdom, and the expression of His love.<a name=241:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us think of such a vessel, formed of so vast a number of persons, each naturally having different features, but all wrought upon by the Holy Spirit, and in the power of the Spirit baptised into one body, and formed after Christ.<a name=241:5></a> Not merely so many individuals formed after Christ, but formed in such wonderful wisdom, that the assembly, when finished, will be absolutely complete as the body of Christ, the fulness of Him who fills all in all.<a name=241:6></a> There will be nothing lacking, and nothing superfluous.<a name=241:7></a> Such is the wisdom of God.<a name=241:8></a> And hence, dear brethren, we can see how urgent it is that we should have a real sense of the greatness of the mind of God, and the importance of the assembly, because it is that which He is forming at this present time.<a name=241:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But first we must have a right apprehension of the Christ Himself.<a name=241:10></a> You remember Simeon had it revealed to him, by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death until he had seen the Lord's Christ; the Christ of God.<a name=241:11></a> And in Luke's gospel Peter is recorded as having confessed the Lord as the Christ of God.<a name=241:12></a> It is an immense thing to get an apprehension of Christ as the Christ of God; He is the One in whom God will head up all things.<a name=241:13></a> God has been pleased

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now all this was indicated early in a hidden way in Genesis, for as we know, God not only created the heavens and the earth, and not only operated to bring the earth out of the condition of chaos in which it was, but then He operated to bring about an ordered world.<a name=242:3></a> Hannah says in her song, "The pillars of the earth are Jehovah's, and he hath set the world upon them" (<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#2:8">1 Samuel  2:8</a>).<a name=242:4></a> So that not only did God bring the earth into view as a platform of His operations, but He created a world of life in infinite variety; the birds of the heaven, and the fishes of the sea, and the cattle and beasts of the earth; and great variety in each class.<a name=242:5></a> God loves variety of life, and He brought into being a world with variety of life in it.<a name=242:6></a> And then having done that He created man, and He set him over the whole realm.<a name=242:7></a> And having done that, He said, "It is not good that Man should be alone; I will make him a helpmate, his like" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:18">Genesis  2:18</a>).<a name=242:8></a> Now that is the position typically, dear brethren, in relation to the Christ.<a name=242:9></a> Of course, when you come to the Christ as the antitype of Adam, He was <i>not</i> created, He is the Word become flesh.<a name=242:10></a> "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.<a name=242:11></a> <i>He</i> was in the beginning with God.<a name=242:12></a> All things received being through him,

		and without him not one thing received being which has received being" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:1">John  1:1</a> - 3).<a name=243:1></a> And then in verse 14, we read, "And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us".<a name=243:2></a> A stupendous thing, the most momentous thing in all history, that God Himself should become Man, in the Person of Christ, in order that all God's thoughts regarding man should now come into view, in One competent to set them forth and maintain them.<a name=243:3></a> But then what is perhaps equally marvellous is that God should propose that Christ should have a helpmate, His like; that He should have a complement, formed of those who are only creatures; that by means of God's operation in those who are creatures, there should be brought into view this vessel which in its completeness is to be the fulness of the Christ.<a name=243:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, dear brethren, this is no longer a matter only of light, but the assembly is here, the time for it has come.<a name=243:5></a> Many years went by in the ways of God since He gave this hidden indication of what was in His mind, before Christ came.<a name=243:6></a> But now He has come, and the Spirit, too, has come.<a name=243:7></a> We might ask, Why did God allow so many centuries to go by before He introduced Christ, when the thought was in His mind all along?<a name=243:8></a> That, of course, is deserving of enquiry but among other things, I have no doubt God intended to demonstrate that none of His thoughts could be made good in any other man but in the second Man out of heaven.<a name=243:9></a> It needed a divine Person in manhood as the only one in whom God could effect His thoughts in regard to man.<a name=243:10></a> But I say again, dear brethren, that the time for this has come, and therefore let every brother and sister ask himself why has God wrought in me in new birth?<a name=243:11></a> Why has He opened my

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is another thing we have to bear in mind, not only what God is working, but how Christ loves the assembly.<a name=244:6></a> As the woman was brought to the man, as formed from the man, the man said, "This time it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:23">Genesis  2:23</a>).<a name=244:7></a> Now the Lord can look upon the assembly in that light, although it is not yet complete.<a name=244:8></a> He can see something tangible there amongst the saints, and He is entitled to clothe it with complete thoughts, and the Christ has loved the assembly, and has delivered Himself up for it.<a name=244:9></a> I would that every brother and sister might get a real sense that there is that on earth at the present moment which is the peculiar object of the love of Christ.<a name=244:10></a> There are other families, and all will stand in the value of the redemption accomplished in the death of Christ, but no other family, in heaven or earth, has the place in the affections of Christ that the assembly has.<a name=244:11></a> And therefore the Supper is so precious; it belongs exclusively to the assembly.<a name=244:12></a> In it we get a definite sense that there is that which is unique in the love of Christ for the assembly, which is our own portion and belongs to no other family.<a name=244:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		All that, dear brethren, would quicken our desires that the Christ should dwell in our hearts by faith; because, speaking reverently, He belongs to us, as we belong to Him.<a name=245:1></a> The feminine speaker in the Song of Songs says first of all, "My beloved is mine, and I am his" (<a href="../bible/SongofSongs.htm#2:16">Song of Songs  2:16</a>), but then later on she says, "I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine" (chapter 6: 3).<a name=245:2></a> She first thinks of what Christ is to her, but as she moves on, she says, "I am my beloved's", putting that first, as though her heart rises to the sense of what the assembly is to the heart of Christ, and she glories in that.<a name=245:3></a> And that is what we should glory in.<a name=245:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The assembly is a wonderful conception, we can easily understand what a wonderful place it will have with Christ in the day to come, when He administers the whole scene, heaven and earth, for the pleasure of God and for His glory; He will have available to Him a vessel which is entirely of Him, His own fulness.<a name=245:5></a> In it, all that He is morally as a Man can find expression, and He will use it as the heavenly city coming down out of heaven from God, in order to express the glory of God.<a name=245:6></a> Not only has God been perfectly expressed in Christ, the Word become flesh, but now the Lord has available under His hand, and will have in completeness in a day soon to come, a vessel in which the glory of God can be perfectly expressed.<a name=245:7></a> And what that must mean to the heart of Christ, for there was nothing that He cherished more than that God should be glorified.<a name=245:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a most touching thing that the Spirit of the One who has conceived these things, the One who is the Head of the whole system of glory, that is the Father, should be operating in our hearts with a view to this, that the Christ might dwell in our hearts by faith.<a name=247:3></a> He is not to be dislodged from the place that is due to Him.<a name=247:4></a> He is entitled to this place in the affections of the assembly, and He is not to be dislodged from it.<a name=247:5></a> If He has His place in our hearts, one result will be that we shall be devoted to His interests in His absence.<a name=247:6></a> That is a sure proof of Christ having His place in our hearts, and if we are not devoted to His interests in His absence then it may well be questioned whether He has His place in our hearts.<a name=247:7></a> And so it says, "Being rooted and founded in love, in order that ye may be fully able to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height; and to know the love of the Christ which surpasses knowledge; that ye may be filled even to all the fulness of God".<a name=247:8></a> I do not enlarge on that, dear brethren, because what I particularly wanted to stress at this time was the great thought of "the Christ" dwelling in our hearts by faith.<a name=247:9></a>

		Now I pass on to Philippians, because the apostle there in writing to those saints says, very significantly, "Ye have <i>me</i> in your hearts" and the 'me' is emphatic.<a name=247:10></a> As you read the epistle you cannot but be impressed with the bond of affectionate sympathy which existed between the Philippian saints and the apostle Paul.<a name=247:11></a> And another thing that runs right through the epistle, and especially the first chapter, is

		<a name=248>[Page 248]</a>

		the thought of the glad tidings.<a name=248:1></a> So Paul says, "Both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of the glad tidings ye are all participators in my grace".<a name=248:2></a> We are not to have any low thoughts as to the glad tidings, or to become careless in regard of them, because the glad tidings are God's public testimony in the world, the name of God is bound up with them.<a name=248:3></a> Let us not forget that they are God's public testimony in the world, He is to become known as a Saviour God.<a name=248:4></a> And not only is there to be the verbal testimony to the glad tidings, as it says, how shall they hear without a preacher, so the preaching must go on.<a name=248:5></a> It is essential in the ways of God that men should hear through a preacher, but what is possibly even more important than the verbal testimony is that the saints themselves should commend the gospel by being the exponents of the power of the gospel to save them practically, so that they are not overcome by any principle of evil of this world, or by the pressure of things in this life.<a name=248:6></a> They are able to stand forth in the world, whatever comes upon them, as saved persons, persons who through the power of the glad tidings are superior to the influences to which they are subjected.<a name=248:7></a>

		Now Paul represents that in this epistle to the Philippians.<a name=248:8></a> He represents one who in an outstanding way was formed by the gospel; not a popular gospel, but the heavenly gospel.<a name=248:9></a> That had been the means of transforming a man who had been a vessel of Satan, breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, so that he took on the Spirit of Christ, and moved in this world completely superior to the circumstances of pressure through which he was called to pass.<a name=248:10></a> That is the power of

		Take chapter 3 of this epistle and see what marked him as he drew near to the end of his life; a man whose life had been so full of devoted service to Christ, and I have no doubt he was still carrying the burden of all the assemblies in his heart, and concerned too about the ministry, because in the prison he wrote some of his choicest epistles.<a name=250:9></a> But then instead of being over-burdened by these things he shows us in chapter 3 what was before him.<a name=250:10></a> He says his great desire was to gain Christ - you marvel that Paul should say that, and to be found in Him.<a name=250:11></a> He is looking forward to that which he is going on to, to be found entirely in Christ, with not a trace at all of Saul of Tarsus, not a trace left of the natural, and yet it would be Paul; but Paul in Christ.<a name=250:12></a> But he was looking forward to it, and we may well look forward to it.<a name=250:13></a> And if we have it before us as the great goal to which we are being led, the concern will be

		Well now, in closing I refer to Corinthians because Paul says, "Ye are in our hearts, to die together, and live together".<a name=251:3></a> He has been opening up much to the Corinthians and he arrives at a point where he urges on the Corinthians to come out from every link with evil and be separate, he says, and touch not the unclean thing.<a name=251:4></a> Notice how emphatic the Spirit of God is, "Touch not what is unclean" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#6:17">2 Corinthians  6:17</a>).<a name=251:5></a> And there is the promise of the Lord Almighty to the one who will answer to these injunctions and come out from among them and be separate and not touch what is unclean.<a name=251:6></a> God says, "I will receive you; and I will be to you for a Father, and ye shall be to me for sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty".<a name=251:7></a> That is, there is that promise on God's part.<a name=251:8></a> And now the apostle says, "Having therefore these promises".<a name=251:9></a> I understand the thought of a promise is that God gives us something that faith can rely upon.<a name=251:10></a> If God makes a promise, He has committed Himself to it and He will not fail.<a name=251:11></a> And therefore in all the testing exercises that compliance with these injunctions may result in, there is this promise to support faith, and God will stand true to His promise.<a name=251:12></a> "<i>I</i> will receive you; and I will be to you for a Father, and ye shall be to me for sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty".<a name=251:13></a> Not only is He faithful but He has the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so Paul says, "Having therefore these promises, beloved, let us purify ourselves from every pollution of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in God's fear".<a name=252:2></a> The fear of God is a most important thing, it is one of the greatest preservatives there is.<a name=252:3></a> It is something that should mark us all through our course, the oldest or most spiritual of us has to recognise that he has to be in the fear of God all the day long.<a name=252:4></a> "Be thou", Solomon says to his son, "in the fear of Jehovah all the day" (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#23:17">Proverbs  23:17</a>).<a name=252:5></a> There is nothing so preservative as the fear of God.<a name=252:6></a> I believe the fear of God is what answers to the salt that we often read of in Scripture; in all our offerings there is to be salt, and we are to have salt in ourselves.<a name=252:7></a> Then he says, "Receive us: we have injured no one, we have ruined no one, we have made gain of no one.<a name=252:8></a> I do not speak for condemnation, for I have already said that ye are in our hearts, to die together, and live together".<a name=252:9></a> How the apostle stresses the thought of 'together', to die together first, and then live together.<a name=252:10></a> That is the principle of Christianity, life out of death; but he says "to die <i>together</i>, and live <i>together</i>".<a name=252:11></a> We know well that in Corinth there had been a setting up of particular leaders in a spirit of rivalry so that Paul had to say that they were saying, "<i>I</i> am of Paul, and another, <i>I</i> of Apollos" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3:4">1 Corinthians  3:4</a>).<a name=252:12></a> But he tells us later on that he had transferred those things to himself and Apollos so as to bring the matter out more clearly and appeal to them more tenderly without exposing the particular local leaders that were really involved.<a name=252:13></a> Then he says, "Who then is Apollos, and who Paul?<a name=252:14></a>" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3:5">1 Corinthians  3:5</a>),

		So this is intended to regulate us in our relations with one another, that there should be no rivalry, either on my own part or on the part of others on my behalf, or anything of that sort.<a name=253:7></a> But the apostle says, "Ye are in our hearts, to die together, and live together".<a name=253:8></a> And that is the great thing, dear brethren, to be together, to be together in love, and anything that will promote it is to be followed up by us; and anything that will hinder it or be prejudicial to it is to be avoided.<a name=253:9></a> We shall be together at the coming of the Lord, it says, "Then <i>we</i>, the living who remain, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air; and thus we shall be always with the Lord" (<a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#4:17">1 Thessalonians  4:17</a>).<a name=253:10></a> And so it is a great matter to have the saints in our hearts.<a name=253:11></a> "Ye are in our hearts", the apostle says, "to die together, and live together".<a name=253:12></a> Satan is always busy in some way or another to seek to bring in disrupting influences; but Paul had the saints in his heart, to die together, and live together.<a name=253:13></a> May the Lord help us in these things for His name's sake.<a name=253:14></a>

		It has come to me, dear brethren, to speak tonight about the kingdom, sometimes spoken of as the kingdom of the heavens, sometimes as the kingdom of God, and I have this additional thought to take notice of the context in which the idea of the kingdom is introduced, hoping to show that it is in view of something else; in view of making way for something else; preparing the people, I might say, for still greater things.<a name=255:1></a> In referring to the passage in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#2">Matthew  2</a>, I just wish to show how indications were given to men of a great event: the greatest event in man's history was shortly to take place.<a name=255:2></a> It was not published in the literature of the day, either political or religious, but there were indications in the heavens that some took account of, and they were interested enough to follow a movement, an unusual movement that took place in the heavens.<a name=255:3></a> I want to try and impress on all here, especially the young people, how God would make provision for us to attract our attention, and to arouse our interest and to give us to understand that what He has in mind to bring us into is greater than anything that is in the world.<a name=255:4></a>

		greatest work; it was there that he unfolded the truth of the assembly in its highest setting.<a name=257:1></a> Reference was made this afternoon to taking on the refined things; the things that spiritually are great and magnificent and beautiful, and it is a well-known thing to this company of saints that the truth of the assembly as developed at Ephesus presents the highest and the best.<a name=257:2></a> Now, without saying more on those lines I would draw your attention to this skilled workman, this man who is so skilful in his ministry that he went into the synagogue and he spoke boldly for the space of three months, "reasoning and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God".<a name=257:3></a> Why did Paul begin there?<a name=257:4></a> The answer is that the power of the kingdom is necessary.<a name=257:5></a> It is necessary that it should be known and that it should be enjoyed if we are to take up assembly relations and enjoy the best and the highest of our privileges.<a name=257:6></a> The kingdom of God is designed to bring man under control.<a name=257:7></a> At the very outset of the history in the garden we see the woman out of control.<a name=257:8></a> She was deceived into stepping out of divine control, and the result was disastrous because she affected her husband and he got out of control.<a name=257:9></a> Now, of what use can any of us be in the assembly if we are not under divine control; the control of God?<a name=257:10></a> Some of us have known little meetings that have broken up through violence, through violent persons; persons who have not recognised the authority of the truth.<a name=257:11></a> Perhaps these same persons would profess to own the authority of Christ, but if we do not accept the authority of the truth are we not really denying the authority of Christ?<a name=257:12></a> I only mention that to show that if unbroken persons, persons out of control, not subject to the

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to draw attention to how Paul handled this matter of the kingdom.<a name=258:3></a> It says that he reasoned: "Reasoning and persuading".<a name=258:4></a> It seems to me that these thoughts are such as we need to make use of today in our meeting rooms.<a name=258:5></a> You could not reverse those two words, you could not begin by persuading, the reasoning must come first, and if we seek for an illustration of what the reasoning is, it is the epistle to the Romans, the great reasoned epistle.<a name=258:6></a> The skill of the Spirit in a remarkable way coming through this chosen vessel has shown us how to reason, according to God; not according to man, but according to God.<a name=258:7></a> If we were to take time to look at that epistle we should find out that one great feature in it is the thought of analysis, of self-analysis, but we have not only to analyse what we see at work around us, but we have to analyse what is in ourselves, and we are not ready to take charge of ourselves until we learn what we have to take charge of, and that the control is by the Holy Spirit.<a name=258:8></a> The matter is so great that it needs the Holy Spirit.<a name=258:9></a> Again and again in the Roman epistle Paul uses words like these - "What shall we then say", as though he would appeal to the minds of those who are reading his letter, as though he would say, now what have you got to say.<a name=258:10></a> It is a time to speak, as feature after feature is opened up, it is a time to speak; a time to say something, and a time to do something.<a name=258:11></a> But what a reasoning it was,

		and yet it was in the synagogues for this space of three months, but what power there must have been in his reasoning.<a name=259:1></a> Then he persuaded too.<a name=259:2></a> When things are spread out before us, the authority of the truth is drawn to our attention, we may still need to be persuaded.<a name=259:3></a> Many of the young people need a helping hand to make a start, and it requires to be a skilful hand, too.<a name=259:4></a> It is not a question of numbers, or of gaining some distinction in the way of being known as helping young people; it is not that, it is a question of discerning the work of God, and whether the time has come to persuade.<a name=259:5></a>

		Paul gives us his own magnificent persuasion in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>.<a name=259:6></a> I think I will read it, it is worth drawing our attention to.<a name=259:7></a> In verses 38, 39 he says: "I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord".<a name=259:8></a> What a persuasion!<a name=259:9></a> Many of us here, I trust most, if not all, could join in with that persuasion, and begin with the words, "For I am persuaded".<a name=259:10></a> That "I" is very individual, and each of us should ask ourselves as we sit here in this very place where I am assured the power of God is operating and is ready to operate for any one of us to make good any deficiency, or to heal any disease and to fill us with joy in God.<a name=259:11></a> We each must ask ourselves if we are being affected by it.<a name=259:12></a> Is it causing us to say something within; perhaps only the Spirit knows what you say, but He may be listening for a word from some of us here, the young people especially, a word that would indicate that the

		spoken of in the book of Joshua, you will remember that after the people had crossed the Jordan the Lord told Joshua to make sharp knives and circumcise the people, for all the children that had been born in the wilderness were uncircumcised.<a name=263:1></a> It is as though God says, now you have passed through the Jordan I am going to apply all the benefits of the death of Christ to you, I am going to give you the results of that victory, but there is something that you must do, you must understand that I am not going on with man after the flesh or with man according to nature.<a name=263:2></a> You must understand that in the death of Christ there was a judicial end of that man, and I have finished with him.<a name=263:3></a>

		Now, I bring this in because there are many dear young people here, and perhaps the basic teaching of Romans is not as much insisted on as it used to be, perhaps not as much as it should be.<a name=263:4></a> Many of our dear young people may be moved and encouraged to come into fellowship and to take up assembly privileges, and then they find that the position is not what they thought it was; they have not learnt this great lesson.<a name=263:5></a> God has one Man before Him, and that is Christ; all others must go.<a name=263:6></a> Not only must they go doctrinally, but practically.<a name=263:7></a> You say, how is it possible; how can we as we are in present conditions, how can we maintain this, how can we go forward on this basis?<a name=263:8></a> Well, the answer is, by the Spirit.<a name=263:9></a> The work that was to be done down here was so great and so intensive, involving every single individual in the assembly, that a divine Person had to come here.<a name=263:10></a> He was sent, sent for this work which He carries on day and night; He has had to do it in every one that is to have part in the assembly.<a name=263:11></a> We need a divine

		These verses we have read, dear brethren, come in after the revelation proper has been completed.<a name=265:1></a> That is to say, the unveiling, which the word <i>revelation</i> means, was really completed at verse 5, but then the Lord addresses to us these verses we have read as a kind of appeal to us all as to what our attitude is going to be as having been given this wonderful book of Revelation.<a name=265:2></a> It is a great message from God that we should be made intelligent as to all that is to come to pass, because the world around us knows nothing.<a name=265:3></a> It may have its fears but it knows nothing as to what is about to happen, but to us it is given, in the grace of God, to be intelligent in all that is to arise, and that I believe is a feature, dear brethren, of sonship, that God loves to have His sons intelligently with Him in all that He has in mind to do.<a name=265:4></a>

		Now in connection with these verses I wanted to draw attention to the fact that three times over the Lord says, "I come quickly".<a name=265:5></a> In the first place in verse 7: "I come quickly.<a name=265:6></a> Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book", and then again in verse 12: "Behold I come quickly, and my reward with me, to render to every one as his work shall be", and then finally in verse 20 "Yea, I come quickly" with nothing added.<a name=265:7></a> It is Himself there; the final word is Himself - "I come quickly", but one desired to draw attention to this thrice-repeated word, "I come

		quickly" and what stands connected with it, and also to draw attention to one or two other features that appear in the passage, and especially the thought of bondmanship which was alluded to last night, and which is a prominent feature, as we know, of this book of Revelation.<a name=266:1></a> It says in verse 6, "the Lord God of the spirits of the prophets has sent his angel to show to his bondmen the things which must soon come to pass".<a name=266:2></a> There can be no doubt, dear brethren, that the present time calls for bondmanship, indeed, the testimony of God has always called for bondmanship, and so the angel who has to rebuke John because John was prepared to fall down and do homage at his feet, says to him, "See thou do it not.<a name=266:3></a> I am thy fellow-bondman, and the fellow-bondman of thy brethren the prophets, and of those who keep the words of this book".<a name=266:4></a> That is to say the angels are bondmen, and the prophets have been bondmen, and we are to be bondmen, bondmen of God; that is, wholly committed to God's things; in no other way can the testimony go forward to completion, save in the spirit of bondmanship, and so one would remark, in passing, that of the five writers of epistles only two of them (that is, Paul and Peter) call themselves apostles.<a name=266:5></a> Peter, in his second epistle, adds bondman.<a name=266:6></a> He says, "Bondman and apostle of Jesus Christ" (<a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#1:1">2 Peter  1:1</a>), but James addresses us as "James, bondman of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ" (verse 1).<a name=266:7></a> John, in his second and third epistles calls himself "the elder", and in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:1">Revelation  1:1</a> calls himself "his bondman John", that is, the bondman of Jesus Christ.<a name=266:8></a> Jude says he is "bondman of Jesus Christ, and brother of James" (verse 1).<a name=266:9></a> That is to say these three writers of epistles,

		although they had authority by reason of the place the Lord had given them, do not explicitly assert it, but rely rather on their moral authority by reason of their love for the saints as evident in their epistles.<a name=267:1></a> James constantly says "my beloved brethren" and Jude speaks of the saints in similar terms, and John, as we know, is the great one who loved, and they certainly had moral authority by reason of their love for the saints, and I question whether we have any moral authority if we do not love the saints, and I doubt if our moral authority is any greater than the measure of our love, but I say these three writers do not assert authority in their epistles, but rather present themselves as bondmen, of God and of the Lord Jesus.<a name=267:2></a> And so they would incite us all to take up that attitude of mind.<a name=267:3></a> Indeed, beloved brethren, bondmanship of God and of the Lord Jesus is not merely something to be taken up, as it were, voluntarily, it is our normal relation to God and to the Lord Jesus.<a name=267:4></a> As was stated yesterday, the epistle to the Romans develops how we are in fact to become bondmen of God.<a name=267:5></a> Having been bondmen of sin the grace of God has come in in order to make us practically bondmen of God, and the way it comes about is worked out in the early chapters of the epistle to the Romans; the sixth chapter especially, our mind coming into the matter - a right reckoning in the light of the truth as it is presented, and then the eighth chapter bringing in, in the Holy Spirit, the power to make it good.<a name=267:6></a> But I say, dear brethren, that bondmanship on our part to God and to the Lord Jesus arises properly from the fact that we are their absolute property; that They have an absolute right to us, both creatorially and through redemption.<a name=267:7></a> So that
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=268>[Page 268]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		bondmanship to God is simply the recognition on our part that they have an absolute, incontestable right to us, and our happiness and our power in the testimony depend upon the measure in which we are prepared to yield ourselves to that position which is right for each one of us.<a name=268:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is the thought of bondmanship also in relation to the saints.<a name=268:2></a> As Paul says, "We do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus Lord, and ourselves your bondmen for Jesus' sake" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:5">2 Corinthians  4:5</a>).<a name=268:3></a> That is bondmanship in relation to the saints, taken up in love, under the influence of love - for Jesus' sake - and that is an important matter too, and a matter that will greatly contribute to the well-being of the saints, if in every locality there are those who are prepared to be bondmen of the saints for Jesus' sake.<a name=268:4></a> But as regards this thought of bondmanship in this chapter in Revelation, and indeed in the whole book, for it is a characteristic expression of the book of Revelation, the idea of bondman really flows from the fact that both God and the Lord Jesus have an absolute right to us.<a name=268:5></a> And the Spirit of God has come in in order that it might be real and effective.<a name=268:6></a> The Spirit of God is able to control our minds and hold us for the service and pleasure of the blessed God.<a name=268:7></a> The way the Spirit is being emphasised at the present time is intended to encourage us to seek to know Him personally, and intimately, and to accord Him without any reserves the place that He is entitled to.<a name=268:8></a> He has come in in order to secure us, spirit, soul and body for God and for the Lord Jesus, and to enable us in liberty and intelligence to fill out our part in assembly service, and also to enable us to stand here as committed to the testimony, with no private interests

		that would conflict in any way with divine interests.<a name=269:1></a> The Spirit is here in order to bring about in us this attitude of mind of bondmanship to God and to support us in it.<a name=269:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I said earlier that in that position we are in the company of angels and of prophets and of those who keep the words of this book.<a name=269:3></a> And so it says, "The Lord God of the spirits of the prophets".<a name=269:4></a> What an important matter that is - the spirits of the prophets, for we are living in days when evil is increasing, when things that are done may strike us as unreasonable and arbitrary, and how necessary it is, if we are to be here representative of God, that our spirits should be kept.<a name=269:5></a> "The Lord God of the spirits of the prophets".<a name=269:6></a> God places great value on the spirits of the saints, and hence the importance of the fact that the Holy Spirit has taken His abode in us, as James says.<a name=269:7></a> God attaches great importance to the spirits of those who represent Him, and we do represent Him, beloved brethren, as having the Holy Spirit, we are here as representative of God in His testimony in this world, and in that position we come under divine notice and protection; as it says, "Touch not mine anointed ones, and do my prophets no harm" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#105:15">Psalm  105:15</a>).<a name=269:8></a> On the other hand the opposition may be allowed to do harm to the bodies of the saints, but it is not contemplated that they can overcome their spirits, and so we have in Stephen one of the first and one of the greatest prophets of the New Testament.<a name=269:9></a> We see how his spirit was so blessedly preserved, as he says as he falls asleep, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7:59">Acts  7:59</a>).<a name=269:10></a> How God attaches value to the spirits of His prophets; those who represent Him in this world, and are capacitated in the Spirit to

		And now the first time the Lord says, "I come quickly", He says, "Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book".<a name=270:6></a> That is, keeps them in mind, and is affected by them, and that raises the question with us all, dear brethren, as to how much we know of the book of Revelation, and how much we are carrying it in mind, and how much it is regulating our outlook, and affecting us.<a name=270:7></a> What a book it is!<a name=270:8></a> We have chapters 2 and 3 which give, as we well know, an epitome of assembly history as the Lord has seen it, and how we are to be affected by it; we ought to be affected by it as tracing the history of the declension of the assembly, from all that it enjoyed as set up under Paul's ministry at Ephesus, and then what it became in Thyatira, and that is all around us today, and then the Lord's word to Sardis, "I have not found thy works complete before my God" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:2">Revelation  3:2</a>).<a name=270:9></a> The Lord is looking for completeness, that there should not be a single element wanting in God's thoughts regarding the assembly.<a name=270:10></a> He is looking for a perfect answer to it, and if the Lord addresses Sardis and says, "I have not found thy works complete before my God", He presents Himself as the One who has the seven Spirits of God, as though to say, 'I have at My disposal all that is

		The Holy Spirit has been recognised and known by us in a sense all along, as the One who alone gives power in divine things, and we have proved His help in the past, but now He is being brought before us in His own Person in a personal way; as the Lord says, "Another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#14:16">John  14:16</a>), and again, "He shall guide you into all the truth" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#16:13">John  16:13</a>).<a name=271:5></a> What could be more blessed than that, and that He is there to be referred to, and there to be communed with, and there to be availed of, and He has taken up His abode in us; in each of us individually.<a name=271:6></a> Each one of our bodies is "the temple of the Holy Spirit" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#6:19">1 Corinthians  6:19</a>), and He has come in to take up His abode in the assembly, and to be with us right through to the end, and again I say to guide into all the truth.<a name=271:7></a> Hence, dear brethren, how important it is, if any of us have reserves or difficulties in regard of this matter of the Spirit, that we should really get to the Lord about it, and get to the Spirit Himself about it, so that we may be relieved of our difficulties and reserves, that we may come fully and happily into the joy and happiness of that which is known

		and proved among the saints.<a name=272:1></a> And so dear brethren, without the Spirit we shall never reach completeness, but in the full recognition of the Holy Spirit, and as increasingly affected individually by the presence of the Spirit, for the presence of the Spirit requires increasing subjection on our part, increasing dependence, increasing concern as to holiness, increasing sensitivity, the presence of the Holy Spirit with us requires all that, but as we are prepared to face up to the exercises that the presence of the Spirit involves, I say we shall find in increasing measure what He is to us as in the assembly, and we shall find that He will really guide us into all the truth; not only opening up the mind of God, but giving us the capacity to understand it and to move in it in liberty, dignity and power.<a name=272:2></a> The Lord had to say to Sardis, "I have not found thy works complete before my God", but then how we rejoice in the light of Philadelphia and all that it means; assembly revival, recovery of all the truth, as the Lord says to Philadelphia, "Hold fast what thou hast, that no one take thy crown" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:11">Revelation  3:11</a>).<a name=272:3></a> What a crown it will be, dear brethren, if we are enabled to arrive at a complete answer in life and intelligence and dignity, to all the thoughts of God regarding the assembly.<a name=272:4></a> What a joy it will be for the heart of Christ; what joy for the heart of God; what a crown to the assembly if, after all its history in the past, that is what is arrived at; and that is what we are to have in mind.<a name=272:5></a>

		Well now John sees that - He says, "And I saw", and then as I said, seven further paragraphs, each one beginning with, "And I saw", covering the whole closing up of things in this world, leading up to the overthrow of the beast and the false prophet, and the chaining of Satan for a thousand years, and then, when the thousand years are completed, the great white throne, and evil finally dealt with and the lake of fire finally brought in, showing God's ability to carry matters right through.<a name=276:5></a> As Solomon said to his son, "Let thine eyes look right on" (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#4:25">Proverbs  4:25</a>), and the book of Revelation is given us for that very purpose, to enable us to have our eyes looking right on, and I say again, dear brethren, that the more we keep the words of the prophecy of this book the more we shall be in peace and steady in regard of all that is happening in the world, because we see that God has the ability, and is going to do it, to carry everything to an issue that is according to Himself.<a name=276:6></a> But what He is occupied with at the moment is the assembly, and the completion of His thoughts regarding it, and the securing in the assembly of a sphere in which all that will be brought in publicly at the coming of the Lord Jesus

		Christ is already secured among the saints.<a name=277:1></a> So the last "and I saw" that John gives us is in chapter 21: 2.<a name=277:2></a> In verse 1 he says, "And I saw a new heaven and new earth", and then he says, "And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband".<a name=277:3></a> That is the last thing that John specifically says he saw.<a name=277:4></a> He is shown something after this, and, of course, he saw it, but he is specifically shown what follows.<a name=277:5></a> But what I have alluded to is what he <i>sees</i> as carefully observing what the Lord is bringing before him, going right on to completion, and hence the importance with us of keeping the "words of the prophecy of this book".<a name=277:6></a> We have been much impressed of late, dear brethren, and again in these meetings, with the sense that the assembly comes down out of heaven; she is heavenly; heavenly in origin, as has often been said; heavenly in constitution too, for in the Holy Spirit those who compose it partake of the life and spirit of the heavenly One, as it says: "Such as the heavenly one, such also the heavenly ones" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:48">1 Corinthians  15:48</a>), and the idea of being heavenly is to take possession of our minds.<a name=277:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So here in the eternal state John sees the "holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband".<a name=277:8></a> As has often been said, that is after the thousand years, showing that during the millennium there is no deterioration, but she is prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.<a name=277:9></a> A bride likes to look her best; it is a figure used; it is not exactly <i>the</i> bride, although of course it is the bride, but I mean it is not exactly presented in that way as <i>the</i> bride, but rather the figure is used - "prepared as a bride adorned for her

		husband".<a name=278:1></a> What bride does not want to look her best, and are we concerned, dear brethren, to look our best, if I may use that expression?<a name=278:2></a> Is the assembly concerned to look its best; is it considering what the Lord would love to see in us, for that is the idea?<a name=278:3></a> What kind of features would the Lord delight to see us marked by, for what is seen when the assembly, the holy city, new Jerusalem, in the eternal day comes down out of heaven from God, is that she is prepared as a bride adorned for her husband?<a name=278:4></a> That is to say the features of beauty that mark her have been the subject of a good deal of preparation on her part, and the governing consideration in the preparation is, what kind of features will the Lord love to see?<a name=278:5></a> I need not say, dear brethren, that they will be features that correspond with Himself.<a name=278:6></a> Where can we learn what is really attractive to God, save in Christ?<a name=278:7></a> The more we consider Christ, dear brethren, the more we find that He was always considering for the pleasure and glory of God, never considering for Himself.<a name=278:8></a> He never sought His own glory, He never did His own will.<a name=278:9></a> The more you follow Christ through the gospels and other scriptures that speak of Him, the more you will find that He is always considering for the glory of God.<a name=278:10></a> As it says in Peter, "That God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#4:11">1 Peter  4:11</a>).<a name=278:11></a> That is brought down to us; it is to govern us in our service; it is to govern us in all that we do among the saints, "that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ".<a name=278:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		So after all these things that John says he saw, we find in chapter 21: 9 that an angel, one of the angels that had

		been given the seven bowls, comes to him and says, "Come here, I will show thee the bride, the Lamb's wife".<a name=280:1></a> And so he is now shown something, as though the Spirit of God would enlarge on the assembly, for the bride the Lamb's wife is the assembly, and she is God's great masterpiece, and the result of the Spirit's unremitting labours for two thousand years, and so John is shown the bride, the Lamb's wife, and he sees a city.<a name=280:2></a> It can be measured, and its wall can be measured and its gates can be measured; a great vessel of administration in love, for love is the great matter.<a name=280:3></a> As Paul says in that great administrative epistle, the epistle to the Corinthians, "Let all things ye do be done in love" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#16:14">1 Corinthians  16:14</a>), and again he says, "If I .<a name=280:4></a>.<a name=280:5></a>.<a name=280:6></a> have not love, I am nothing" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#13:2">1 Corinthians  13:2</a>), a most sweeping statement.<a name=280:7></a> I might have prophecy, and understand mysteries, and have faith to remove mountains, and so on, but if I have not love I am nothing.<a name=280:8></a> And the present time is the time of formation in love, and hence the Supper, week after week, dear brethren, gives us a fresh start in a fresh week under the influence of love.<a name=280:9></a> It is the first thing that we touch as a fresh week begins, that we come afresh under the influence of love.<a name=280:10></a> This do, the Lord says, for a calling of me to mind.<a name=280:11></a> It is love in expression in Christ towards the assembly, and while, of course, the immediate end in view is that He should be called to mind, and that conditions of love towards Himself should come into evidence, so that He may come in and take His place, and then the service of God proceed, at the same time what is required is love amongst ourselves, and every week we come afresh under its influence so that we may be formed by it.<a name=280:12></a> This city as the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What an important matter the wall is, dear brethren.<a name=281:3></a> The wall is that which is built up; it is a question of what is built up in our souls in the appreciation of the Man Jesus Christ, so that all that is out of keeping is refused, and all that is according to God is preserved.<a name=281:4></a> The city has a wall great and high, and what a wall there was in the early days in the Acts!<a name=281:5></a> There was no code of regulations as to what they were to do, and what they were not to do, but the Spirit of God was unhindered and ungrieved, and there was holiness there among the brethren, holy love, and when evil came in with Ananias and Sapphira, it was immediately dealt with in power, and then it says, "Of the rest durst no man join them" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#5:13">Acts  5:13</a>).<a name=281:6></a> No one dared join himself to them.<a name=281:7></a> There was a wall great and high in the essential holiness that was there among the saints, and it preserved all that was of God and it excluded all that was evil, and that is what the Spirit of God is labouring to bring about more and more.<a name=281:8></a> Thank God we can say it is coming to pass.<a name=281:9></a> It has to go on more and more, the abounding in love and the developing in holiness, and it becomes a wall great and high, and it says first of all of the city that "her shining was like a most precious stone, as a crystal-like jasper stone" (verse 11).<a name=281:10></a> Then it says, "The building of its wall was jasper; .<a name=281:11></a>.<a name=281:12></a>.<a name=281:13></a> the foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every precious stone: the first foundation, jasper" (verses 18, 19).<a name=281:14></a> So that there is a three-fold allusion to the jasper in connection

		with the city, and the jasper means transparency, and the Spirit of God insists on it three times - transparency.<a name=282:1></a> And so you remember that John, before he had got very far in his first epistle, says, "This is the message which we have heard from him, and declare to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#1:5">1 John  1:5</a>).<a name=282:2></a> Hence the Spirit of God, dear brethren, would exercise us continually to walk in the light as God is in the light.<a name=282:3></a> Let the smallest things as well as the greatest things be exposed to the light, and let all that is inconsistent with the light be refused, because jasper has got to mark the city, and it has got to mark the foundation of the city, and so, dear brethren, "this is the message", John says.<a name=282:4></a> It is not simply an item of ministry, so to speak; it is a definite message which he received from the Lord to convey to us, that "God is light, and in him is no darkness at all".<a name=282:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And now the Lord says, "I come quickly.<a name=282:6></a> Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book".<a name=282:7></a> And then we come down to a solemn word in verse 11: "Let him that does unrighteously do unrighteously still, and let the filthy make himself filthy still".<a name=282:8></a> We were speaking yesterday in our first reading of what is judicial; what is judicial in Christendom, and I believe this is in keeping with it.<a name=282:9></a> The time has come now for things to be fixed judicially, and God is doing it - a most solemn consideration - that He is fixing things judicially.<a name=282:10></a> Those who have done unrighteously are doing it still, and those who are filthy are making themselves filthy still.<a name=282:11></a> Then in contrast with that it says, "Let him that is righteous practise righteousness still; and he that is holy, let him be sanctified still", as though the

		And now we have this personal word of the Lord, which we so often delight in, "<i>I</i> Jesus have sent mine angel to testify these things to you in the assemblies.<a name=284:6></a> <i>I</i> am the root and offspring of David".<a name=284:7></a> He is David's Lord as well as David's Son.<a name=284:8></a> It is most affecting, that speaking in this affectionate, familiar way, you might say, to the assembly, the Lord should bring in the truth of His Person.<a name=284:9></a> So that there should always be the adoring, worshipful appreciation in our hearts of the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ, just as in His prayer to the Father, which He allows us to hear, He says, "And now glorify <i>me</i>, <i>thou</i> Father, along with thyself, with the glory which I had along with thee before the world was" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#17:5">John  17:5</a>).<a name=284:10></a> We are to carry that glory in our hearts in relation to the Lord Jesus, and yet He speaks to us as to the assembly which He loves, and He says, "<i>I</i> am the root and offspring of David, the bright and morning star.<a name=284:11></a> And the Spirit and the bride say, Come".<a name=284:12></a> Could we have anything more precious, dear brethren, as to the personality and personal service of the Holy Spirit than this word, "The Spirit and the bride say, Come".<a name=284:13></a> That is what is in view in the way the Spirit is now being given prominence amongst us, that we should understand that He is personally serving us; One of the Godhead, wonderful grace!<a name=284:14></a> One of the Godhead come in to be with us to the end, and to conduct us in bridal affection and suitability to Christ.<a name=284:15></a> "The Spirit and the bride say, Come.<a name=284:16></a> And let him that hears say, Come.<a name=284:17></a>

		Now I read this parable in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13">Matthew  13</a>, because it is an example of the skill of the Spirit in giving us thoughts which are profoundly great and yet which can be put in a few words in view of the smallness of our minds, that we might understand what the Lord is conveying to us.<a name=288:2></a> And the parable speaks about a merchant who was "seeking beautiful pearls; and having found one pearl of great value, he went and sold all whatever he had and bought it".<a name=288:3></a> Now I am counting on the Spirit of God to give us, from these few words, a richer and deeper impression of the value of the assembly in the eyes of the Lord Jesus.<a name=288:4></a> He is presented as a merchant who knows values, who discriminates, but who, having found one pearl of great value, went and sold all whatever he had and bought it.<a name=288:5></a> That is, the assembly, from this aspect, belongs to Christ by purchase, a purchase that involved the selling of all, whatever He had.<a name=288:6></a> Oh!<a name=288:7></a> What a thought!<a name=288:8></a> For the Lord had much.<a name=288:9></a> He had much; not of money, or of things that the world would value, but in His manhood He had much.<a name=288:10></a> But He laid down His life, surrendered all that He had as a Man, that the assembly might be His.<a name=288:11></a>

		"the assembly of God, which he has purchased with the blood of his own".<a name=294:1></a> We might see from this remarkable statement what a valuation God has put on the assembly, that - if I might reverently say - He was prepared to purchase it with the blood of His own.<a name=294:2></a> If you look at footnote <i>c</i>, you will see that the translator had some concern as to how to render this in English, to convey the thought, but there it stands, something to wonder at: "the blood of his own" was the price of the purchase.<a name=294:3></a> This is not the side of the will of God, acting sovereignly in His own almighty power.<a name=294:4></a> This is another side.<a name=294:5></a> We need every aspect, so that we might preserve in our minds what is due to God in all His greatness and glory, and that He is the only One that has a right to have will, and that He exercises that will beneficently, but this speaks of a transaction, a transaction of purchase, the price paid, "the blood of his own", a reference to Jesus, the blood of Jesus.<a name=294:6></a> Oh!<a name=294:7></a> what a price!<a name=294:8></a> And that God should be brought into this matter is most wonderful, that we might have a sense of the feelings of God, of what He went through in this transaction.<a name=294:9></a> We often, and rightly, dwell on the Lord's part.<a name=294:10></a> He was the Sufferer.<a name=294:11></a> He who Himself was a divine Person took a condition in which He could die; and He died.<a name=294:12></a> But God had a part in that!<a name=294:13></a> Oh!<a name=294:14></a> what a part He had, a feeling part!<a name=294:15></a> And the assembly of God is spoken of here in that distinguished manner, and is being commended to the care of the overseers of Ephesus, and this is referred to to give them a sense of what they are having to do with.<a name=294:16></a> Oh!<a name=294:17></a> what holy hands they would lay upon the saints, in anything they had to say to them, to do with them; a sense in their hearts of

		One was impressed, dear brethren, with what came before us this afternoon, the thought of being ready for translation, and that has led me to read these scriptures with the desire to say a word about Enoch who, as we know, was translated, and also Noah, as to both of whom it is said that they walked with God.<a name=297:1></a> That is what is called for now, for we are at the end of the dispensation, as we often say, and if we have never done so before, what is called for now is that we should be walking with God.<a name=297:2></a> There can be no doubt that that is what God intends should precede the translation of the saints, and the prominence that is being given to the presence with us of the Holy Spirit is intended, I am sure, among other things, to promote with us the readiness and the ability to walk with God.<a name=297:3></a> The Holy Spirit is God, and He is with us all the time, and either we are grieving Him or else we are pleasing Him and going along with Him, and therefore we may well raise with ourselves the exercise as to how far each of us individually is characterised by walking with God.<a name=297:4></a>

		Well now, as we read in Jude's epistle, Enoch is spoken of as the seventh from Adam, and he is presented in that light in this fifth chapter of Genesis, for the chapter begins with Adam and traces the generations down to Enoch, who is the seventh, and, of course, while the chapter

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		proceeds beyond Enoch, it is easy to see that a certain climax is reached in Enoch, in that he was characterised by life.<a name=298:1></a> The whole chapter is the line of life, but Enoch pre-eminently is marked by life, in that he walked with God for three hundred years, and then finally is translated so that he does not see death.<a name=298:2></a> So that it is clear that Enoch represents, as has indeed often been said, a certain climax reached as a result of all that preceded him being passed on, so that there was accumulation in the knowledge of God.<a name=298:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we read in regard of Adam that "in the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him.<a name=298:4></a> Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#5:1">Genesis  5:1</a>, 2).<a name=298:5></a> I think we can say, without hesitation, that there must have been much feeling in the heart of God when He called their name Adam, for that means 'man', and as we are having brought so much before us now, all God's choicest thoughts centred in man.<a name=298:6></a> It was man that He had in mind, and He called their name Adam.<a name=298:7></a> That is to say, the thoughts which God had formed from before the foundation of the world were now beginning to take form.<a name=298:8></a> He created man in His own image - "Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam" (or man).<a name=298:9></a> Of course, we well know that it was Christ and the assembly that were in God's mind, for nothing of God's thoughts regarding man could be made good in the first man.<a name=298:10></a> Adam was but a figure of Him who was to come, although in man of Adam's order God would work out His ways, but in bringing Adam on the scene God had in view the One of whom Adam was but a figure, and that is Christ, and when we begin to think of

		How glorious all this is, the whole Godhead involved in it, the Father presented as the source of these things; although doubtless before Christ came, before the economy came into view, you could say the whole Godhead was there in counsel.<a name=299:4></a> But then the economy having come in, the Father is presented as the Father of glory, and then the Son, the One in whom in manhood all God's thoughts were being brought in, and then the Holy Spirit, as conveying to those whom the Father had given to Christ, life in Christ, and becoming the power for formation according to Christ, and for the calling forth of intelligent response in the affections and feelings of Christ.<a name=299:5></a> How great all these things are, beloved brethren, and I believe we may say, without any hesitation, that all these things were in the mind of God when He created Adam, and when He called their name

	<div class="paragraph">
		And so we can see that by the time Enoch is reached there is a great accumulation in the knowledge of God, and that is what I believe, dear brethren, we should be concerned about, for we are not only living near the end of the dispensation itself, but we are living at the close of an era, a period of over one hundred and twenty years, in which God has been steadily working for the recovery of all the truth that had been lost.<a name=300:11></a> The Spirit has now been given His place in order that we might understand that He has in mind to guide us into all the truth, that not a single feature of the truth should be left unknown by us, and the truth involves, above all things, the knowledge of God Himself.<a name=300:12></a> So that we can understand that in this our day it is intended

		But then we are told that "Adam .<a name=301:2></a>.<a name=301:3></a>.<a name=301:4></a> begot a son .<a name=301:5></a>.<a name=301:6></a>.<a name=301:7></a> and called his name Seth" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#5:3">Genesis  5:3</a>).<a name=301:8></a> At the end of the previous chapter we are told that Eve named him Seth, and said, "God has appointed me another seed instead of Abel, because Cain has slain him".<a name=301:9></a> Well, now that is another feature, dear brethren, of great significance.<a name=301:10></a> God in His wisdom allows Satan to exercise his power against the saints, and allows some of them to suffer martyrdom for the truth's sake, but then God is not defeated.<a name=301:11></a> If Abel is slain God brings in Seth.<a name=301:12></a> That is to say one man may die for the truth's sake, but another one is to continue in life, and that is an important matter.<a name=301:13></a> It reminds me of the two sons of Zebedee, James and John, two leading apostles, and one of them was allowed to be martyred and the other one continued in life; that is to say, that is what he represents.<a name=301:14></a> The Lord said of him, "If I will that he abide until I come, what is that to thee?<a name=301:15></a>" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#21:22">John  21:22</a>).<a name=301:16></a> So that John represents what continues until the end, and his ministry is characterised by the thought of life, life in the saints.<a name=301:17></a> And so, if Abel is slain, Seth takes his place, and James and John were surnamed, by the Lord, "Boanerges", that is, "Sons of thunder".<a name=301:18></a> That does not refer to their natural characteristics; the Lord does not surname natural characteristics; He surnames what the saints are spiritually, and I believe "Sons of thunder" represents what they are as bearing a testimony that men are forced to take account of, that they cannot ignore.<a name=301:19></a> These two features of being ready to die rather than surrender the truth on the one hand, and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		then continuance in life on the other hand, are two features which men are forced to take account of.<a name=302:1></a> That is exactly what thunder is.<a name=302:2></a> Thunder is God making His voice heard, and forcing it upon the attention of men, whether they want to hear it or not, and so James and John are Sons of thunder, as presenting this twofold way in which God is pleased to force His testimony upon the attention of men, that on the one hand there has been a line of those who have been prepared to die rather than surrender the truth, and on the other hand there is a line of those who continue in life, never overcome, that go through in life and victory until the coming of the Lord.<a name=302:3></a>

		Well now, these are things, dear brethren, which are of great importance to us.<a name=302:4></a> They are represented in the two assemblies of Smyrna and Philadelphia.<a name=302:5></a> Smyrna is the feature of assembly testimony which proves itself by being faithful unto death, and Philadelphia is the feature of assembly life which values the truth and has a little power, and thus continues to the end.<a name=302:6></a> That is to say, there is the recognition of the Holy Spirit, and in the power of life in the Spirit the whole truth is recovered and maintained to the end, as the Lord says, "Hold fast what thou hast, that no one take thy crown" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:11">Revelation  3:11</a>).<a name=302:7></a> Now these are most encouraging features, dear brethren, that are all to be carried forward.<a name=302:8></a> It may be - one cannot say - that the Lord may allow the Smyrna feature to reappear in the history of the assembly in some parts of the earth, and on the other hand He will see that the Philadelphia feature is carried right through to the end, where there are those prepared to go forward with the Spirit.<a name=302:9></a> So may we appreciate this as a

		feature of God's ways, and incidentally one might add, dear brethren, that Abel was the first man to die; death lay upon man governmentally on account of sin, but the grace of God allowed the first man that died to die for the truth's sake, a wonderful thing, and I believe that is something we can count upon, that often as we accept the government of God He will exercise His rights in mercy, and His ways in grace, and allow what comes upon us governmentally to work out in privilege and blessing.<a name=303:1></a> So it was with Saul of Tarsus, he persecuted the assembly, and caused the saints intense suffering, and therefore it was inevitable in the ways of God that he should suffer supremely.<a name=303:2></a> The ways of God in government required it, but then grace comes in and the Lord says of Saul of Tarsus, "This man is an elect vessel to me, .<a name=303:3></a>.<a name=303:4></a>.<a name=303:5></a> for <i>I</i> will shew to him how much he must suffer for my name" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:15">Acts  9:15</a>, 16).<a name=303:6></a> What came upon him governmentally, and must come upon him governmentally, because he caused so much suffering to the saints, is allowed of the Lord to come upon him on account of his faithfulness to the truth.<a name=303:7></a> So that should be a comfort to us, dear brethren.<a name=303:8></a> There is what is governmental in all our lives and in the history of the assembly too, and yet as it is humbly accepted we may often find, as I have said, that God will exercise His rights in mercy and His ways in grace, and turn what is governmental into what is privilege and blessing.<a name=303:9></a>

		And so we go down this line.<a name=305:2></a> There are certain intervening ones, the meanings of whose names are not given, and which I do not know, although doubtless they have their significance, and then we come to Jared, the father of Enoch.<a name=305:3></a> And it says of Jared that he lived a hundred and sixty-two years, and begot Enoch, and Enoch, as we know, means 'disciplined' or 'devoted'.<a name=305:4></a> Now I believe the significance of Jared naming his son 'disciplined' means that he himself was conscious of having been disciplined.<a name=305:5></a> No doubt Enoch, in due time, was disciplined, for no one of us can walk with God without being disciplined, and if we are disciplined it means that we are sons, and therefore we can take courage, but I believe the fact that Jared named his son 'disciplined' means that he himself had felt what it was to be disciplined for a long period of years.<a name=305:6></a> You will notice that Jared's father had a son when he was only sixty-five years old, and his grandfather had a son when he was only seventy years old, but Jared had to wait a hundred and sixty-two years before a son was born to him.<a name=305:7></a> Think of the discipline that would mean to him; he had passed sixty-five years and seventy years, and he would pass a second sixty-five years and a second seventy years, and still no son.<a name=305:8></a> He would say to himself, how is the light of God to be handed down if there is no son.<a name=305:9></a> Think of the discipline it would be to that man as he went on one hundred and sixty-two years before a son was born to him, and yet he was in the line of life, and how was that light that was shining and increasing to be handed

		Enoch continued it day by day, for it says, "All the days of Enoch were three hundred and sixty-five years".<a name=308:2></a> Day by day he walked with God, and for us, I believe it refers to our going along with the Holy Spirit, for He is God, and the Lord said of the Comforter, that when He was come He should guide us into all the truth, guide us into it, which means, you might say, a day-today matter.<a name=308:3></a> It is not bringing us into it all of a sudden, in one moment, although the Lord can do that if He pleases, but <i>guide</i> us into all the truth means that we are led on from one point to another.<a name=308:4></a> Hence the need of going on with the Spirit, and of cultivating walking with God, avoiding the things that would grieve the Spirit, and cultivating the things that would please the Spirit; seeking grace that our minds might be opened to the Spirit, and to the instruction and the suggestions that He would bring in.<a name=308:5></a> As the Lord says, "He shall receive of mine", that is, My things, "and shall announce it to you.<a name=308:6></a> All things that the Father has are mine; on account of this I have said that he receives of mine and shall announce it to you" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#16:14">John  16:14</a>, 15).<a name=308:7></a> Can we measure the immensity of what is involved in all that the Father has, as it says in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24">Genesis  24</a>, that all the treasure of his master was under the hand of the servant?<a name=308:8></a> He could bring out any feature of the treasure of his master at the right moment; all the treasure of his master was under his hand, and what would not Rebecca be led into then, as she moved along with the servant, what would she not become intelligent in?<a name=308:9></a> Not only would she hear about Isaac and be

		Before I leave speaking of Enoch, I would draw attention to what is said of him in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:5">Hebrews  11:5</a>.<a name=310:1></a> It says that "by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him; for before his translation he has the testimony that he had pleased God".<a name=310:2></a> We are warned not to grieve the Holy Spirit of God; why should we not please Him?<a name=310:3></a> That is the great thing; please the Holy Spirit of God, for He is God; not that we cannot please the Father and the Son, for we certainly can and may.<a name=310:4></a> The three Persons of the Godhead are so wonderfully together in all Their interests, and nothing pleases the Father so much as that we should speak to Him intelligently and in holy liberty and reverentially as we may do at all times.<a name=310:5></a> We may have communion, too, with the Lord, as we well know, but then the Holy Spirit is pleased to remain with us all the time, right through to the end - marvellous thing, and we may well exercise ourselves as to whether, instead of grieving Him, we are pleasing Him.<a name=310:6></a> Enoch walked with God, and he had the testimony that he pleased God, and then it adds further, "Without faith it is impossible to please him.<a name=310:7></a> For he that draws near to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them who seek him out" (verse 6).<a name=310:8></a> Now let me say affectionately to one's brethren, and especially to the younger ones, How much do we seek God out in regard of His own things?<a name=310:9></a> It is one thing to seek God out in regard of our own matters as His children, but how far do we really seek the Father in relation to His things?<a name=310:10></a> That is the whole scope of divine purpose, which centres in Christ and in relation to which we have been called.<a name=310:11></a> Do we get to the Father about these

		things, and ask Him to give us understanding and enlargement and the ability to compass them in some degree in our hearts?<a name=311:1></a> Paul tells us that he did; he tells us that he bowed his knees to the Father, of whom every family in the heavens and on earth is named, that He would grant to us to be strengthened with might by the Father's Spirit in the inner man, so that the Christ might dwell in our hearts by faith, and if the Christ dwells in our hearts by faith, dear brethren, it will not be very difficult to get some impression of the whole scope of the interests and glory that centre in Christ.<a name=311:2></a>

		Now I say, how far do we get to the Father on those lines, and pray that He would strengthen us with might by His Spirit in the inner man, so that the Christ might dwell in our hearts by faith?<a name=311:3></a> Let us understand that if we do He is a rewarder; He is the rewarder of those who diligently seek Him out.<a name=311:4></a> That is to say, there is no reason, while we are most thankful for ministry, and the Lord has given ministry in order that we might be instructed in the truth, why we should be entirely dependent upon ministry.<a name=311:5></a> We have access to the Father, and we have the Spirit of the Father, and He is able to give us the Father's own thoughts, the Father's own appreciation of Christ, and the Father's own thoughts in relation to the whole system of glory that centres in Christ.<a name=311:6></a> Why should we not be concerned to become intelligent for ourselves in regard of these things?<a name=311:7></a> And so it says, "Without faith it is impossible to please him.<a name=311:8></a> For he that draws near to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them who seek him out", and therefore one would encourage the brethren, as oneself, to be marked

		Just a word, dear brethren, on Noah, for Noah in a sense is the counterpart to Enoch.<a name=312:2></a> Enoch walked with God, and I believe the suggestion is that he had communion with God in relation to God's own interests, and God would undoubtedly find great pleasure in that.<a name=312:3></a> But now we come to Noah, and Noah stands in relation to the evil conditions that surrounded him.<a name=312:4></a> It says that "Jehovah repented that he had made Man on the earth, and it grieved him in his heart" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#6:6">Genesis  6:6</a>).<a name=312:5></a> Then it says, "But Noah found favour in the eyes of Jehovah", and then it adds that "Noah walked with God".<a name=312:6></a> That is to say, Noah is presented, I think, not so much as pleasing God by walking with Him in communion in relation to God's own world and His own interests, but rather as finding favour with God and walking with Him as entirely separate from the world of evil by which he was surrounded.<a name=312:7></a> And that, of course, dear brethren, is the other side of the matter for us, because while we have the power in the Holy Spirit to be constantly enjoying eternal life, yet on the other hand we have in fact to pass through a world of evil.<a name=312:8></a> Not only so, but we have to bring up families in a world of evil, which is another matter, and a most serious and difficult matter, and a most important matter, and a matter in which we can count on divine help and divine support.<a name=312:9></a> Noah, I believe, represents that side of the matter, that before he enters upon the practical exercises of building an ark for the salvation of his house, what is said of him is that he "walked with God".<a name=312:10></a> And the scripture we
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=313>[Page 313]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		have read in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11">Hebrews  11</a>says that he was "oracularly warned concerning things not yet seen" (verse 7).<a name=313:1></a> He had warning from God, and that also, dear brethren, is a service which the Holy Spirit performs towards us.<a name=313:2></a> The Lord said of Him, "Having come, he will bring demonstration to the world, of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: of sin, because they do not believe on me; of righteousness, because I go away to my Father, and ye behold me longer; of judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#16:8">John  16:8</a> - 11).<a name=313:3></a> So that while the judgment is not yet seen, the Holy Spirit gives us unquestionable testimony as to the character of the world in which we are.<a name=313:4></a> It believes not on Christ; it has had no place for the righteous One.<a name=313:5></a> He has left the world and gone to the Father, and the ruler of the world is judged.<a name=313:6></a> That is, judgment is pending; it is already announced, and intelligent believers are in the light of that, and therefore as walking with God they are concerned to provide conditions for their own houses, and for all those whom they can influence for good, that will be effective in salvation from the world that is shortly coming under judgment.<a name=313:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There can be no doubt that the ark as built by Noah is a figure or type of the assembly, there is no sphere of salvation like the assembly.<a name=313:8></a> Indeed there is no other sphere of salvation in the world but the assembly.<a name=313:9></a> It is the only sphere of salvation in this world, and what characterises the ark, as you will notice, as you read down the details of it, is that it was marked by light (there was a window), it was marked by a great variety of life, and it was marked by abundance of food.<a name=313:10></a> These are three very important things

		<a name=314>[Page 314]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		which are found in the assembly, and which tend to make it a place of salvation; that is, light, life and variety of food, and thank God for it, for outside all is darkness, and outside all is moral death, and outside there is nothing but starvation in a moral sense, but these things are to be found in the assembly.<a name=314:1></a> The one who fears God and who walks with God will be concerned to bring up his family in the light of the assembly, and in keeping with it.<a name=314:2></a> Baptism of the household is the beginning of it, the definite committal of the whole household to the Lord in the light of His death, and the acceptance of death in the understanding that we have another sphere of life, and that is in the assembly.<a name=314:3></a> So Noah, it says, "moved with fear, prepared an ark for the saving of his house" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:7">Hebrews  11:7</a>).<a name=314:4></a> That would be a long matter; it would be a day-today matter over a long period of years, it would be a matter that would expose him to ridicule on the part of those around.<a name=314:5></a> Indeed we read in 2 Peter that there were mockers in those days as there are mockers in these days, but Noah walked with God.<a name=314:6></a> That was his strength in going forward steadily, preparing an ark for the saving of his house, and how essential that is if the truth of God is to go forward to the end.<a name=314:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord is looking that there should be completion, as we constantly say to one another now, and the Holy Spirit is the pledge of our being able to reach completion if we will only go on with Him, but in regard of our position here in the world, Noah's faith and exercises are those which should govern every exercised believer.<a name=314:8></a> So God said to Noah, "Make thyself an ark of gopher wood: with cells shalt thou make the ark; and pitch it inside and outside with

		pitch".<a name=315:1></a> See the care that he had to take.<a name=315:2></a> "Pitch it inside and outside with pitch", and then his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives went through in the ark.<a name=315:3></a> That is, you might say, the choicest features of the truth are carried through in the assembly.<a name=315:4></a> That is the light of sonship on the one hand, and the light of the wife, the assembly in relation to Christ, on the other, sons and wives were what went through in the ark.<a name=315:5></a> All this is most instructive to us, as showing that as walking with God in the midst of a world of evil we shall be concerned that those for whom we are responsible are brought up in the light of the judgment that is about to fall on this world on the one hand, but in the light that God has a sphere here, a sphere of salvation; a sphere where the most precious thoughts are known and are carried through livingly until the day comes for them to be brought out in display.<a name=315:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is what one had in mind; the thought of walking with God as presented to us in Enoch on the one hand, for that is the most important side of it perhaps; but on the other hand in Noah, the necessary counterpart to what had been in Enoch.<a name=315:7></a> If we are to be prepared for translation, and that is what we all would desire to be now, let us see to it that, whether it has, or has not, marked us in the past, from now onwards our exercise is to walk with God, and to go along with the Holy Spirit in all that He is opening up positively in relation to Christ and the assembly and the great thoughts of the blessed God.<a name=315:8></a> On the other hand, let us go along in faithfulness to God; in faithfulness to our baptism, in committal to it, whatever it involves, in the way of mocking, or ridicule, or suffering.<a name=315:9></a> If it involves suffering,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So we find, in this first allusion to the Holy Spirit, that He is called "the Holy Spirit of promise".<a name=319:2></a> Having believed in the Christ, it says, "ye have been sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise".<a name=319:3></a> There is something very affecting about the thought of being sealed, for it means that God has placed His mark upon us, a mark of ownership, a very blessed thought that we may go through this world in the sense of having been sealed, that God has put His own mark upon us, and, one may say with confidence, takes account of us with pleasure, as those whom He has sealed.<a name=319:4></a> But then the Holy Spirit of promise is a peculiarly affecting reference.<a name=319:5></a> Remember how in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:49">Luke  24:49</a> the Lord said to them, "Behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you; but do ye remain in the city till ye be clothed with power from on high".<a name=319:6></a> That is what He said - "The promise of my Father".<a name=319:7></a> Then in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:4">Acts  1:4</a> they were commanded not to depart from Jerusalem, but "to await the promise of the Father, which [said he] ye have heard of me".<a name=319:8></a> So that the Lord had spoken to the disciples about the coming of the Holy Spirit.<a name=319:9></a> This word in Acts turns our thoughts back to the way the Lord speaks of the Comforter in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>- 16.<a name=319:10></a> His words are recorded there (in Acts), He says, "Which ye have heard of me".<a name=319:11></a> The Lord had prepared the ground in the hearts of the disciples, so that they should learn to appreciate the Spirit, the Comforter.<a name=319:12></a> Indeed, He said, "It is profitable for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go I will send him to you" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#16:7">John  16:7</a>), as though the Lord would say,

	<div class="paragraph">
		you cannot afford to be without the knowledge of the Comforter, as though that would be the final thing, the knowledge of the Father, the knowledge of the Son, but now also the knowledge of the Comforter, the Holy Spirit.<a name=320:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the presence here of the Holy Spirit is a matter of promise; as the Lord says, "The Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#14:26">John  14:26</a>), the thought being that in the presence of the great things which divine love has called us to for God's own pleasure, we are not left at our own charges.<a name=320:2></a> So that the Holy Spirit has been promised, and has come according to promise, in order that we might be brought fully into all that God has in mind for us.<a name=320:3></a> That involves the greatest conceivable elevation.<a name=320:4></a> I think every one of us must feel how little we really know of it, and yet it is here; it is within our reach in the Holy Spirit.<a name=320:5></a> The power to bring us into the thoughts that God has formed regarding us is entirely equal to those thoughts themselves.<a name=320:6></a> It is God Himself who has undertaken to bring His saints into these things, and hence the question is, dear brethren, whether we have yet learned to avail ourselves of the Holy Spirit in the full way in which He has come within our range.<a name=320:7></a> All the apostles speak of it.<a name=320:8></a> Jude says, "Praying in the Holy Spirit" (verse 20).<a name=320:9></a> Peter tells us that the Holy Spirit has been sent from heaven, come on a definite mission, as the Lord says, "He shall guide you into all the truth" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#16:13">John  16:13</a>).<a name=320:10></a> So that if, on the one hand, we have the most exalted thoughts unfolded to us in the epistle to the Ephesians, we are to understand that not one single element of those thoughts is to be left unappropriated by us.<a name=320:11></a> As the Lord said to Joshua, "Every place whereon the sole of your

		foot shall tread have I given to you" (<a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#1:3">Joshua  1:3</a>).<a name=321:1></a> It is a question of entering into possession of all the thoughts of God, and the Holy Spirit of promise has come in in order that that might be made good.<a name=321:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		James also speaks of the Holy Spirit.<a name=321:3></a> He says, "Does the Spirit which has taken his abode in us desire enviously?<a name=321:4></a>" (<a href="../bible/James.htm#4:5">James  4:5</a>).<a name=321:5></a> He is speaking, perhaps, more on the individual side than on the side of what the Spirit is to us as the Comforter collectively, but he uses that affecting expression, that He has taken His abode in us.<a name=321:6></a> There is nothing greater, in a sense, than that, that one of the Godhead should have been pleased to come in and take up His abode in us; in each believer on the one hand and then in the assembly.<a name=321:7></a> It is a most striking thing for each of us to take account of, and it necessitates, dear brethren, that we should all be concerned as to real subjection to the Spirit and real sensitivity as to all that His presence requires, and a readiness to hear His voice and to follow.<a name=321:8></a> All that is involved in the fact that the Holy Spirit has taken His abode in us.<a name=321:9></a> And so it says here that "having believed, ye have been sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, who is the earnest of our inheritance to the redemption of the acquired possession".<a name=321:10></a> He is the earnest of it; that means something substantial, not, indeed, the full measure of what we shall enter into at the coming of the Lord, but a real foretaste of it; not simply light, but something substantial entered upon in the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=321:11></a> So the earnest, dear brethren, is what should be in evidence in our assembly service.<a name=321:12></a> That is, it is a question of entering into the truth, not merely as having light, but as proving the power of it,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So that John in Revelation says, "I became in the Spirit on the Lord's day" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:10">Revelation  1:10</a>).<a name=322:2></a> Then in chapter 4: 1, 2, when he hears a voice saying "Come up here", it says, "Immediately I became in the Spirit", as though John had learned how to avail himself of the Holy Spirit who was dwelling in him.<a name=322:3></a> So that the Spirit gave him the power to move in divine things.<a name=322:4></a> I say again, not merely light, but substantiality in intelligence and liberty, moving in it in a real way.<a name=322:5></a> John in his epistle says, "The Spirit is the truth" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:6">1 John  5:6</a>).<a name=322:6></a> Another important thing for us to bear in mind is that however valuable light may be, and the spiritual intelligence that the Spirit would give us, the Spirit Himself is the truth.<a name=322:7></a> That is, we are to move in the truth in the liberty and the intelligence and the dignity and the power that come alone from the Spirit, and as moving in the truth in the Spirit, the truth becomes a reality to us.<a name=322:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I trust all this, dear brethren, will help to impress us with the great importance to us of the Holy Spirit.<a name=322:9></a> We have in this chapter the Father first - "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ" (verse 3), presented as the source of these things of which we are speaking.<a name=322:10></a> Then we have Christ brought in, presented as "the Beloved" (verse 6), and the One in whom we have redemption through His blood, a most affecting thought, the blood of the Beloved, and then He is presented also as the Christ, the one who effects all God's will and in whom all things are to be headed up in heaven and on earth; and then we have the Holy Spirit, as though this chapter presents to us the whole

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Godhead, moving together in wonderful unity in relation to divine counsels.<a name=323:1></a> We ourselves, dear brethren, are the subjects of those counsels, and we have been taken up for the praise of the glory of God's grace.<a name=323:2></a> That is, all is intended to go back in praise to God; intelligent, affectionate, feeling praise.<a name=323:3></a> Hence, the Holy Spirit Himself comes in in order that there should be no discrepancy between the light of God's thoughts on the one hand and the answer to them on our part on the other.<a name=323:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now when we come to chapter 2, the Spirit is presented in relation to actual access to the Father.<a name=323:5></a> In one sense you might say that in chapter 1 we have the unfolding of divine thoughts and the Spirit's service in relation to them, but when we come to chapter 2 it is a question of actual access, and the Holy Spirit is presented as <i>one</i> Spirit, the stress is on the "<i>one</i> Spirit".<a name=323:6></a> That is to say, the Holy Spirit in His power and ability to unify the saints in the service of God.<a name=323:7></a> And that is a most important matter, that the saints should be really unified in the service of God, for it is not so many separate brethren each individually moving in the Spirit, but the saints unified through Him.<a name=323:8></a> It says that through Christ, "we have both access by one Spirit to the Father".<a name=323:9></a> The setting, of course, is that in the assembly, at the outset at any rate, there were Jews and Gentiles, and the question was, and a very practical question, how the Jew and the Gentile could merge together and move as one in the service of the blessed God in the assembly, a very practical question, as you may imagine.<a name=323:10></a> We have not now the question in that acute form; that is to say, we have practically no Jews in the assembly now.<a name=323:11></a> But
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=324>[Page 324]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		then in another way we <i>have</i> got the question in an acute form, and that is how can the different brethren, different in natural characteristics, different in their outlook, different in their measure of intelligence and so on, how can they merge as one in the service of the blessed God?<a name=324:1></a> The answer is the Holy Spirit, but there has to be a basis for it in our souls, dear brethren, if we are to move together without any hindrance, without anything working underneath that prevents the most complete unification in love so as to move together as one in the service of God.<a name=324:2></a> And hence we have the cross brought in; how important the cross is.<a name=324:3></a> It means judicially the ending of the man, whether the man is the Jew or whether he is the Gentile, whether he is learned or whether he is unlearned, whatever features mark him naturally, the cross is the end of it all, and if we are glad to appropriate the cross and the moral import of it in regard of ourselves, we should be equally glad to appropriate it in regard of our brethren.<a name=324:4></a> That is the secret of it, the learning to appropriate the moral import and power of the cross, the way Christ has taken in order that the man himself should be ended.<a name=324:5></a> If the man is ended then his natural features go, and we are entitled to disregard those natural features and to take account of one another according to what we are as born of God and as having received the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of the ascended Man, and as the subjects of the work of God.<a name=324:6></a> Surely we are dignified enough if we view one another in that light; we can well afford to take account of one another in that light, and rejoice that the cross of Christ entitles us to close our eyes to all else.<a name=324:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=325>[Page 325]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So, dear brethren, with that in our minds the Holy Spirit comes in as positive power.<a name=325:1></a> It says, "Through him" (that is, through Christ) - recognising, as we always must, the mediatorial position in which our Lord Jesus Christ stands, and will stand eternally in view of the service of God.<a name=325:2></a> It says, "Through him we have both" (that is, Jew and Gentile, or whatever we may be in our natural differences) "access by one Spirit to the Father".<a name=325:3></a> Then, "In the power of one Spirit <i>we</i> have all been baptised into one body" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:13">1 Corinthians  12:13</a>) that is, submerged, and merged positively in the Spirit, "and have all been given to drink of one Spirit".<a name=325:4></a> And so this matter, dear brethren, of real unification in the Spirit is a most essential matter if there is to be the service of God in the assembly.<a name=325:5></a> The assembly is an entity to move as one under the impulse of Christ, the assembly is the body of Christ, and therefore the urgent need that we should be thoroughly together in love, because there must be no disunity, and if there is disunity the movements of the assembly in the service of God will be so much hampered.<a name=325:6></a> So we have, as I have said, the cross of Christ on the one hand and indeed the impelling influence of love as seen in the cross, and then the positive power of the Holy Spirit, so that we may move together as one in access to the Father.<a name=325:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now when we come to chapter 3 it is perhaps one of the greatest presentations of the Holy Spirit that we have in Scripture, and the apostle prays.<a name=325:8></a> He says, "For this reason I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom [that is, the Father] every family in the heavens and on earth is named, in order that he may give you according to the riches of his glory" - note the "according to" and the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=326>[Page 326]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"riches of his glory".<a name=326:1></a> How the Spirit of God through Paul uses superlative expressions in this epistle, as though to impress us with the sense that everything is superlative, because it is according to God.<a name=326:2></a> It must be superlative, and we could never rise to what is superlative save in the power of the Spirit of God.<a name=326:3></a> So he says, "That he may give you according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with power by his Spirit in the inner man" - that is, the Father's Spirit.<a name=326:4></a> It is most touching how the Holy Spirit will take on different characters in order to give effect to the pleasure of God, and here He is presented as the Father's Spirit - "to be strengthened with power by his Spirit in the inner man; that the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts".<a name=326:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now when we remember, dear brethren, that the Father is presented as the Originator of these great thoughts of love, and the One of whom "every family in the heavens and on earth is named", I think we can understand that as it is the Father's Spirit who is operating in our inner man, He is able to bring the Father's thoughts into our hearts, the Father's thoughts as to Christ, and the Father's feelings as to Christ, and the Father's thoughts in regard of all the families.<a name=326:6></a> It is a question of the Spirit of the One who has Himself conceived these things, having His own place in our hearts, and His operations have in view, first of all, that the Christ may dwell in our hearts by faith.<a name=326:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We can easily see, dear brethren, that if the Christ Himself is dwelling in our hearts by faith we shall not have very great difficulty in understanding something of the "breadth and length and depth and height".<a name=326:8></a> It refers to the whole expanse of glory and blessing which the Father has

		in His mind to bring in, and it is all centred in the Christ, and hence if the Christ dwells in our hearts we shall not have very much difficulty in getting some impression of the whole extent of glory that centres in Him.<a name=327:1></a> It is a question of the affections of a true wife, the Christ dwelling in our hearts means that we have in our souls the sense that the assembly is united to Christ, and that all that He has as Man we are to enter into with Him.<a name=327:2></a> Therefore if the One who loves the assembly, and whom the assembly loves, is really in our hearts, then the whole extent of His interests will likewise come into our hearts.<a name=327:3></a> It is an immense thing if we get into our souls the sense that divine grace has linked us up with Christ, that our "life is hid with the Christ in God" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3:3">Colossians  3:3</a>).<a name=327:4></a> Just as Adam had the woman brought to him in the position of headship in which God had placed him, so the assembly has been given to the Christ, and as the woman was given to Adam and found her place alongside of Adam, she would understand that she was with him in the whole system over which he was appointed as head.<a name=327:5></a> She would share with him all his interests, she would be his help-mate in that position, and that is the idea, dear brethren.<a name=327:6></a> The first chapter presents the exalted position in which the Christ has been placed by the blessed God, and then it says, "Gave him to be head over all things to the assembly, which is his body, the fulness of him who fills all in all" (verses 22, 23).<a name=327:7></a> So we are inseparably bound up with the Christ, and the thought is that the interests of the Christ and all that centres in Him are to be our interests.<a name=327:8></a> As we are strengthened by the Father's Spirit in the inner man it means that the Father's own thoughts and the Father's own

	<div class="paragraph">
		feelings can be brought into our hearts by the Spirit of the Father.<a name=328:1></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:26">John  17:26</a>, the Lord says, speaking to His Father, "That the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them" - the love with which the Father loves Christ may be in us, that is a wonderful thing.<a name=328:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You might say how can that be possible, but the answer is, the Father's Spirit makes it possible, "That the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them;" that is to say, the Father would bring us so thoroughly into accord with His own thoughts and His own joys that we are to be capable, in some degree, of having in us the very love with which He loved Christ.<a name=328:3></a> The secret of it is, I believe, that we are strengthened with might by the Father's Spirit in the inner man.<a name=328:4></a> If we ponder these things, dear brethren, we cannot but be impressed with the wonderful nearness to God into which the assembly is brought; not, indeed, as we have often said, having any part in Deity, but brought as near to Deity as the creature can be.<a name=328:5></a> But God is pleased that it should be so, and He is pleased that we should be brought into such nearness to Himself as to be able to enter feelingly with Him into His own chief joys, and that is possible by the Father's Spirit.<a name=328:6></a> We get a kind of inkling of it in Peter's account of the scene on the holy mount, when he says that they were with Him (that is, with Christ) on the holy mount, and they heard <i>such</i> a voice (the Father's voice), saying, "This is my beloved Son, in whom <i>I</i> have found my delight" (<a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#1:17">2 Peter  1:17</a>).<a name=328:7></a> It is the Father drawing Peter and James and John into His own feelings in regard of Christ.<a name=328:8></a> What could be more precious; what could be greater grace than that, that we should be found in that position in

	<div class="paragraph">
		relation to the Father, and it is possible for us as strengthened with might by the Father's Spirit in the inner man.<a name=329:1></a> But then the Lord also said, "And I in them".<a name=329:2></a> That is to say, we are to have, in some sense, an appreciation by the Father's Spirit of His love for Christ, and the joy He finds in man as before Him in Christ, and thus, you might say, in the assembly.<a name=329:3></a> But then also "I in them;" that is to say, the assembly is to be the vessel in which the response to that love finds expression, as the Lord said, "In the midst of the assembly will I sing thy praises" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:12">Hebrews  2:12</a>).<a name=329:4></a> So in relation to that the Holy Spirit (not that we get it in this passage, but I mention it in passing) is pleased to take another character, that of the Spirit of God's Son, so that the response to God in the assembly should be in every way worthy of Him as being the expression of Christ's own praises.<a name=329:5></a> I think there is nothing more interesting than to see the different characters, if one may use that expression, which the Holy Spirit, Himself God, is pleased to take in the economy into which God has entered, in order that the full thoughts of God should be entered upon by His saints, and that an answer worthy of God should be secured from them.<a name=329:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the apostle prays here, to come back to this passage, that we might be strengthened with power by the Father's Spirit in the inner man, that the Christ may dwell through faith in our hearts, being rooted and founded in love, in order that we may be fully able to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height.<a name=329:7></a> Now, how much do we know of it, dear brethren, and if we are conscious that our measure is small, do we do

		Well now, I would say a word or two in closing on chapter 6, because there we come to what is very important.<a name=331:2></a> I might say in passing that we have in chapter 4: 30, "Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with which ye have been sealed for the day of redemption", and in chapter 5: 18, we have, "Be filled with the Spirit".<a name=331:3></a> We are reminded in that way of the seal, as though to give us an incentive not to grieve the Holy Spirit of God.<a name=331:4></a> He has indeed taken up His abode in us, and He is not going to leave us; wonderful grace that the Spirit will never leave us.<a name=331:5></a> Even though He is grieved He does not leave us, although we lose the sense of His power and do not get it back until we have judged ourselves.<a name=331:6></a> It is a most affecting thing that He remains with us right through, as the Lord says, "That he may be with you for ever" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#14:16">John  14:16</a>), and hence we can understand the appeal, "Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with which ye have been sealed for the day of redemption".<a name=331:7></a>

		But now we come to chapter 6 where it is a question of the conflict, because I suppose if Satan sees the saints having desires in relation to what is heavenly, having desires in the direction of entering upon the elevation of which we have been speaking, we may rest assured that the enemy will attack.<a name=331:8></a> He will not cease to attack.<a name=331:9></a> It is not exactly that we ourselves are the object of his hatred so much, as that God is the object of his hatred, and his effort is to rob God of His present pleasure in the saints.<a name=331:10></a> He cannot rob God of having His pleasure in us eternally, but he is bent upon robbing God of His present pleasure in the

		saints.<a name=332:1></a> If he sees the saints in any degree moving after heavenly things, then the enemy will be constantly attacking, and hence the apostle tells us that we are to put on the panoply of God, a complete thought.<a name=332:2></a> It is not simply one or two items of armour, but a complete set of armour, a panoply, and we are to put it on, and as you read down the different features of armour you understand that they refer to subjective conditions in ourselves, and that is a most important matter.<a name=332:3></a> The armour really deals with moral conditions, because if we fail in that which is moral we shall certainly be hindered in regard of that which is spiritual, and hence the enemy's constant effort is to get in through some weakness on our part in relation to what is moral.<a name=332:4></a> And so the armour consists of moral features maintained in our souls, and so it says, for instance, we are to have girt about our loins with truth.<a name=332:5></a> It is what we ourselves do, we are to gird about our loins with truth, and we are to put on the breast plate of righteousness, and we are to see that we have our feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace, the preparation of it.<a name=332:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 2: 17, that we have already alluded to, tells us that "coming, he has preached the glad tidings of peace".<a name=332:7></a> How important it is, dear brethren, that we should have the glad tidings of peace in our hearts; the way God has wrought through the cross to set aside every element of disturbance, and we are to maintain that in our souls, in our movements in relation to one another, and see that our feet are shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace.<a name=332:8></a> Then it says, "Having taken the shield of faith with which ye will be able to quench all the inflamed darts of the wicked one".<a name=332:9></a>

		Then the "helmet of salvation" which I suppose is a preservative for the mind, and then it says "and the sword of the Spirit, which is God's word".<a name=333:1></a> How important that is, beloved brethren, "the sword of the Spirit, which is God's word".<a name=333:2></a> We are told how the word of God operates in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#4:12">Hebrews  4:12</a>.<a name=333:3></a> "The word of God", it says, "is living and operative, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and penetrating to the division of soul and spirit, both of joints and marrow, and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart".<a name=333:4></a> What fine distinctions the Holy Spirit can make, and we have got to be prepared for that.<a name=333:5></a> It is one of the elements of our safety that we are constantly marked by attention to the Spirit's voice and the Spirit's touch, so to speak, because He will make the finest distinctions.<a name=333:6></a> He divides between soul and spirit, and between joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart, and we are to avail ourselves, first of all, of the sword of the Spirit in relation to ourselves, before we can use the sword effectively in relation to others.<a name=333:7></a> You remember how we read of the judge Ehud in the book of Judges, the one who learned how to use the sword in delivering power for God's people, that it says that he made <i>himself</i> a sword having two edges, and it was of a cubit length.<a name=333:8></a> But the word 'cubit' there means no fixed length, no particular length.<a name=333:9></a> That is to say it indicates that he had learned how to use the Spirit of God, the word in the power of the Spirit, against himself first.<a name=333:10></a> "Ehud made him", it says, "a sword having two edges", and it was of no fixed length, that is to say, it was readily adaptable to anything and everything that he had to meet.<a name=333:11></a>

		Well, if we accustom ourselves, beloved brethren to use the sword of the Spirit against ourselves, then we shall find that we may have a measure of power in using it offensively against the enemy, and that is what is needed, the sword of the Spirit, which is God's word.<a name=334:1></a> Of course, the presence of the Spirit and the using of the Spirit by us involves constant dependence, but as dependence is maintained we find, as occasion requires, that the Spirit of God gives the word that is needed, so that it becomes God's word, and that is what is needed.<a name=334:2></a> The longer we go on in assembly exercises and assembly history, the more we find out that no situation arises for which there is not the word of God.<a name=334:3></a> The Spirit of God brings forward just what is needed from the Scriptures with divine authority that effectively meets the attack of the enemy, and that is a most comforting thing.<a name=334:4></a> Only we have to learn how to use the sword, and cannot learn how to use the sword effectively if we do not first learn to use it upon ourselves.<a name=334:5></a> And so it says, having "the sword of the Spirit, which is God's word".<a name=334:6></a> The word of God is a veritable armoury, and it is also a veritable treasury.<a name=334:7></a> But here it is the aspect of the armoury; something that can be drawn upon as occasion requires to meet any attack of the enemy.<a name=334:8></a>

		Then finally we read, "Praying at all seasons, with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit".<a name=334:9></a> That is to say, we have the Spirit brought in now as the power for prayer and supplications.<a name=334:10></a> "Praying at all seasons, with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching unto this very thing with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints".<a name=334:11></a> You can see how full the apostle's heart is, and how he

		I have sought, in one's measure, to bring these things before you, that we may get some impression of what is available now in the Holy Spirit.<a name=335:7></a> He has been sent from heaven; He has been sent in Christ's name, and the Lord has sent Him from with the Father.<a name=335:8></a> So that He has been pleased to take up a position in which He is available both to the Father and to the Son, in order that all the thoughts of God, of which we ourselves are the objects, should be entered into by us now in power and reality, and that we should serve God according to the elevation of those thoughts.<a name=335:9></a>

		I think the meetings we have had together, dear brethren, have served to give us a fresh impression of the greatness of that which we have part in as sealed with the Holy Spirit and living in a day when all God's thoughts regarding the assembly are being recovered to the saints.<a name=337:1></a> It is therefore of great importance that we should all be helped to have a greater understanding, a more definite appreciation, of what it is that we have been called to.<a name=337:2></a> It is for that reason that I have read these three verses in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12">Hebrews  12</a>, for the writer of the epistle says, just before where we began reading, that we have not come to the mount that might be touched, but then he says, "Ye have come to mount Zion", and then to seven other things which are enumerated one after the other.<a name=337:3></a> And therefore he is giving, by the Spirit, an outline of what it is that we believers have come to, what we belong to in contrast to the system of law with which God's people of old were connected.<a name=337:4></a> And the first thing is mount Zion, and that is the great principle of God's sovereignty exercised in mercy.<a name=337:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a great thing to get the sense that all that we have part in is due to the sovereignty of God and to His intervention in mercy in our Lord Jesus Christ when all was lost on the line of man's responsibility.<a name=337:6></a> We are always to be kept in the sense of that, and that is why I read those verses

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		from <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#78">Psalm  78</a>, because they indicate in an unmistakable way that that is what mount Zion stands for.<a name=338:1></a> The psalmist is recalling one of the blackest points in the history of Israel, when, through unfaithfulness to God, everything committed to them was lost.<a name=338:2></a> Even the ark was lost, so that everything had broken down and gone on the line of responsibility, and then it says that the Lord awoke, as though He would rise up in His own sovereign rights.<a name=338:3></a> Nothing could be hoped for on the ground of responsibility, but if He was pleased to intervene sovereignly in mercy, then, of course, He had a free hand to do what He pleased.<a name=338:4></a> That is what the psalm opens up; that the Lord awoke and "rejected the tent of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim, But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved".<a name=338:5></a> It is a great thing to have the sense that all that we have part in through grace, and will have part in eternally, is the outcome of God having been pleased sovereignly to intervene in mercy when there was no hope for us at all on the line of responsibility.<a name=338:6></a> It gives God all the glory, and it leaves God a free hand to do whatever He pleases.<a name=338:7></a> He is in no sense limited now to what would be forthcoming if responsibility were fulfilled - not that I am suggesting, of course, that in Christianity responsibility is not fulfilled, because one result of the giving of the Holy Spirit is that there is power in believers, in the Holy Spirit, to fulfil every responsibility, and the righteous requirement of the law is being fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh but after the Spirit - but the basis of all that is that God has intervened in sovereign mercy, accomplishing

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		None of us could claim these things as a right or as deserved; it is a question, purely, of the sovereignty of mercy, and it is well, as I have said already, that we should be confirmed in the sense of it, because if God is operating now on those lines, it means that He is left free to do whatever He pleases, and that means that He can bring in the greatest possible thoughts.<a name=339:2></a> Whatever His love desires; whatever His wisdom conceives; whatever His power establishes; God is free to do it all.<a name=339:3></a> Hence that is what we have come to, dear brethren, a system of blessing and glory which has its roots in the fact that God has of His own free will intervened in mercy, accomplishing redemption through our Lord Jesus Christ, and freely giving the Holy Spirit to those who believe.<a name=339:4></a> So it says, "Ye have come to mount Zion".<a name=339:5></a> It is an immense thing to get the sense of it, and <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#125:1">Psalm  125:1</a> gives us another touch in regard to mount Zion, for it says, "They that confide in Jehovah are as mount Zion, which cannot be moved; it abideth for ever".<a name=339:6></a> That is, mount Zion not only stands for that which exists in the sovereignty of divine mercy, but it also stands for that which is absolutely stable.<a name=339:7></a> It will never be removed, and that implies that we have come to finality.<a name=339:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then it says, following on that, "and to the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem".<a name=339:9></a> Now we have not only come to the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem, but we are the thing itself; that is, the assembly <i>is</i> the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem.<a name=339:10></a> It is the idea of what is dignified; that which we can rightly be proud of belonging

		Those to whom the epistle was written would remember that Jerusalem had been God's centre on earth, His chief interest.<a name=341:3></a> Indeed one of the psalmists says, "If I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#137:6">Psalm  137:6</a>).<a name=341:4></a> Jerusalem was to be first with him, but now the assembly is the heavenly Jerusalem.<a name=341:5></a> It is to come down exercising an influence that is really heavenly, and where can we learn that but from Christ?<a name=341:6></a> He is the One out of heaven, and we are intended during this time to keep ourselves more and more under the influence of Christ, and the Spirit is faithful to that end.<a name=341:7></a> What is heavenly is now to come in so that you remember in the gospel of Matthew, in what we call the Sermon on the mount, the Lord several times says, "Ye have heard that it has been said .<a name=341:8></a>.<a name=341:9></a>.<a name=341:10></a> But <i>I</i> say unto you" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#5">Matthew  5</a>).<a name=341:11></a> That is to say a new influence, a new heavenly influence, was now to come in and it was to be learned from Christ in view of the formation of this city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem.<a name=341:12></a>

		Christianity is a great and glorious system, but it is a system of affection centring in Jesus.<a name=349:1></a> And, of course, the name Jesus conveys the glory of His Person as being Himself God, and hence we are intended to be impressed with the glory of the system to which we belong, that the One who is the centre of it and who is the Head of it too, and gives character to it is no less than Jesus.<a name=349:2></a> And so he is Mediator, it says, "of a new [or fresh] covenant".<a name=349:3></a> That is, the idea of freshness is connected with it, and how often we taste that at the Supper.<a name=349:4></a> It seems to turn our thoughts to the idea of the cup.<a name=349:5></a> The Lord says, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as ye shall drink it, in remembrance of me" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:25">1 Corinthians  11:25</a>).<a name=349:6></a> That is to say, He is calling attention to Himself, it is Jesus, and as things are held in relation to Jesus in that way, they become constantly fresh.<a name=349:7></a> It is a Person appealing to us, and showing us that in His own death He went the whole length that was required in order that we might be freed from all that attached to us, and might take up what belongs to us as heavenly.<a name=349:8></a> He went the whole way in all that death meant to Him, in order that we might be liberated to move in the dignity and liberty of Christianity.<a name=349:9></a> Every Lord's day He confirms it to us afresh, and there is a freshness attaching to the Supper, and peculiarly, may I say, to the cup, because it is not simply what Jesus has done, but it is Jesus Himself confirming His own personal love to us in the cup, and we all drink of it together.<a name=349:10></a> Then it says, "to the blood of sprinkling, speaking better than Abel".<a name=349:11></a> That is to say, it speaks, I believe, of the claims of divine love over us.<a name=349:12></a> Redemption has been effected in the blood of Christ, the blood of God's own, we might

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I do not need to refer further to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#78">Psalm  78</a>, save that we might look for a moment at the last verse which I read, which says, "He built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which he hath founded for ever".<a name=350:2></a> That shows that God, in intervening in mercy, had in mind the sanctuary, and establishing eternal conditions, in which He would be served by the saints for His own pleasure.<a name=350:3></a> As I say, nothing is more stimulating than the thought that we are called to minister to the pleasure of God as serving Him in His sanctuary.<a name=350:4></a> The idea of the sanctuary, of course, implies holy conditions, and when it comes to eternal conditions, of course, they are essentially holy.<a name=350:5></a> There is no need to stress the idea of the sanctuary when we come to eternal conditions, for the conditions then will be essentially and eternally holy, but the idea of the sanctuary refers especially to the present time, that in a world of evil, holy conditions can be maintained among the saints in which God can be served according to His pleasure.<a name=350:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now we come to the passage I read in <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#24">Leviticus  24</a>, and I read it because it has in mind that the system, so far as concerns affording pleasure to God, makes certain demands upon us; not demands in a legal way, but that we are essential to it.<a name=350:7></a> We sometimes speak of the wonderful economy into which God has come in view of revelation, and all that is involved in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, but I think you will agree that
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=351>[Page 351]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		if God has come out in revelation it is <i>us</i>, that is the saints, who are in mind.<a name=351:1></a> The saints are needed to fill out the economy with the response in love which God's heart looks for; the economy requires the saints for the filling out of it.<a name=351:2></a> The economy, of course, is the arrangements, if one may use such a commonplace word in such holy things, which the Persons of the Godhead have entered into between Themselves, with a view to God being revealed as Father, and the revelation being made effective, and response to it secured, in the saints.<a name=351:3></a> So, as I say, it requires the saints for the filling out it, and that should be a great stimulus to us, to see that not one of us is failing to fill his own part in this wondrous economy.<a name=351:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#23">Leviticus  23</a>, the chapter preceding where we have read, gives the feasts of Jehovah.<a name=351:5></a> That is, it gives a list and details of the various holy convocations of God's people.<a name=351:6></a> How God takes pleasure in the gatherings together of the saints!<a name=351:7></a> He would have them together in order that they might afford pleasure to Him, and chapter 23 goes into that at great length, leading right on to the thought of the feast of tabernacles.<a name=351:8></a> But now when we come to chapter 24, we find that the children of Israel are commanded that <i>they</i> are to bring - it is not what Moses is to bring, nor what Aaron is to bring, but what the children of Israel are to bring - to bring "pure beaten olive oil for the light, to light the lamp continually".<a name=351:9></a> You will notice in these verses that I have read, the constant repetition of the word 'pure' - pure beaten olive oil for the light, and then the pure candlestick (verse 4), and then the pure table (verse 6), and then pure frankincense (verse 7).<a name=351:10></a> That is, God is stressing what is pure,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=352>[Page 352]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and that is what the Spirit of God, I believe, would emphasise amongst us in these closing days, that whatever mixture there has been in Christendom hitherto, whatever there has been that has been impure, God is looking for a complete answer to His own holy thoughts at the end.<a name=352:1></a> He wants purity; He wants His own thoughts maintained in absolute correspondence to them.<a name=352:2></a> You might say that is expecting too much.<a name=352:3></a> No, it is not expecting too much, and that is why the Holy Spirit is being so stressed at the present time, and why the urgent need is for all of us to see that we not only recognise the truth of the Spirit, but that we ourselves are formed in subjection to the Spirit, so that our very thoughts are spiritual, and our movements are spiritual.<a name=352:4></a> That is what we are all intended to arrive at in the closing days, because God wants purity.<a name=352:5></a> He wants a perfect answer to His thoughts to find expression among the saints.<a name=352:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I cannot go in any detail into these verses, but we get first of all the light, the light of the candlestick, and then the table, the table with the bread of remembrance.<a name=352:7></a> The first thing is that the people are called upon to bring the pure olive oil beaten for the light, to light the lamp continually.<a name=352:8></a> That is, the light is always to be shining.<a name=352:9></a> It is a question of the light the Holy Spirit will give amongst us, the light as to Christ, the light as to divine thoughts.<a name=352:10></a> It is to be always shining continually.<a name=352:11></a> The lamps were to be trimmed, it says, from evening to morning.<a name=352:12></a> That is to say, the whole period of the night is to be covered by this idea of light in the power of the Spirit, the light is always to be there.<a name=352:13></a> It is to be there in ministry, but not simply in the gifts, but it is to be there as the saints gather together.<a name=352:14></a> There is always to be
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=353>[Page 353]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		light shining, and what is necessary for that is that we should bring the "pure beaten olive oil for the light".<a name=353:1></a> That means, of course, the Holy Spirit in each one of us.<a name=353:2></a> The "beaten", no doubt, is an allusion to the discipline and exercise that we must all go through, because if the Spirit is to gain increasing place with us, the flesh and what is natural are to have less and less place, and God will help us on those lines in order that the light may shine more simply, but the great point is that the saints themselves are to bring the oil.<a name=353:3></a> That is to say, we ourselves, in ourselves, in the Holy Spirit being unhindered amongst us, are to provide the conditions every time we are together in which the light can shine unhinderedly.<a name=353:4></a> It is a question of light shining among the saints.<a name=353:5></a> So, dear brethren, if there is not light shining amongst us, we should ask ourselves as to what is the reason.<a name=353:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If there is no light shining in our reading meetings, for instance, what is the reason?<a name=353:7></a> Has there been an exercise on the part of the brothers, and on the part of the sisters, to provide the "pure beaten olive oil for the light?<a name=353:8></a>" Or do we come to the meetings carelessly, and as a matter of course, and are we careless as to whether we come at all, or not?<a name=353:9></a> God has in mind that right through the night until the morning comes, there should be light shining among the saints, light as to Christ, and light as to God's thoughts concerning the assembly as bound up with Christ.<a name=353:10></a> We ourselves are responsible to bring, in the Holy Spirit, the conditions which will ensure the shining of the light.<a name=353:11></a> But then the answer to the shining of the light is seen in the table.<a name=353:12></a> That is to say, the table suggests the saints appearing
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=354>[Page 354]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		before God in divine order, characterised by the features of Christ.<a name=354:1></a> That is the answer to the light.<a name=354:2></a> The light shines on the one hand, it shines over against the candlestick, it makes everything of Christ, but then the answer to the light for the pleasure of God is to be found in the saints formed after Christ, moving together in divine order and unity.<a name=354:3></a> And so that is what the table suggests.<a name=354:4></a> The apostle refers to it in the epistle to the Colossians, where Christ is presented in His ability to sustain the saints before God as characterised by His own features, living in His own life, and the apostle says, "Rejoicing and seeing your order, and the firmness of your faith in Christ" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:5">Colossians  2:5</a>).<a name=354:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So that is what is in mind, and I referred to this passage, in closing, simply to touch on these two things, and to indicate that the system that we belong to is to be maintained in its living character before God for His pleasure, and God looks to us to provide the spiritual conditions, in the Holy Spirit, so that the light may shine, and the formative work go on, so that Christ reproduced in the saints is continually before God for His pleasure.<a name=354:6></a> And that is what is in mind, and then you notice that it says, "It shall be a bread of remembrance", a most precious thought.<a name=354:7></a> How God can look down upon the saints as walking before Him in unity and love and as having taken on, and become characterised more and more by, the features of Christ, how He can look down on it with pleasure.<a name=354:8></a> It is a bread of remembrance.<a name=354:9></a> I suppose it brings Christ to remembrance on the one hand, and then it is also a memorial for the saints themselves - a bread of remembrance.<a name=354:10></a> Think of this pleasure for God in these days, when, as we were hearing

		So, to apply the Scripture, I suggest that these psalms stress the moral and spiritual ascent, whereas soon we shall have the actual ascent.<a name=359:2></a> But now everything is on moral and spiritual lines; and the great end of these psalms of the 'going up' is this matter of the brethren dwelling together in unity; dwelling in the wonderful sphere provided, where we have such fluidity, such conditions, as are in mind in the similes employed in this psalm.<a name=359:3></a> We have read of the oil running down; what a figure of speech, dear brethren, to suggest the free flowing of what comes from heaven, what comes from an ascended Head; and what comes from the power of the glorious Person here below in the assembly with us, the blessed Spirit!<a name=359:4></a> Who can doubt that in the use of language such as "the precious oil" the Spirit is typically in mind?<a name=359:5></a> But what underlies these psalms is that we see how persons prefer Jerusalem and Zion above everything else; that the great cardinal feature in their outlook in life is Jerusalem and Zion.<a name=359:6></a> And the Lord is helping us to see more and more, dear brethren, that the assembly, and what is linked with the assembly as the centre of divine operations here below, is to have the prime place in all our considerations; so that whatever there may be great and grand according to man in this world, we are not turned aside by it.<a name=359:7></a> We know a realm where there are much greater things taking place, and we are in it now; we are in it tonight, the realm where these great things are; not where they shall be, but where there are now brethren dwelling together in unity.<a name=359:8></a>

		It needs to come home to us more in our localities, the great need of being merged together as drinking into the same Spirit and moving together with a united front, so that no breach is allowed for the enemy to find ingress into the position.<a name=360:1></a> May the Lord help us to see the importance of it more and more in practical reality in our cities, for what underlies it are <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#131">Psalm  131</a>and <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#132">Psalm  132</a>.<a name=360:2></a> We get reference in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#131">Psalm  131</a>to one who behaves "like a weaned child" (verse 2).<a name=360:3></a> He says, "Jehovah, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty" (verse 1).<a name=360:4></a> What a matter that is, dear brethren.<a name=360:5></a> We have been speaking about the lowliness of Elisha, and Paul beautifully refers to "going along with the lowly" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#12:16">Romans  12:16</a>).<a name=360:6></a> The Lord Jesus could refer to Himself as "lowly in heart" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11:29">Matthew  11:29</a>); and what a wonderful thing to be amongst those that are lowly!<a name=360:7></a> That is what is in the mind of this person here; and he continues, "Surely I have restrained and composed my soul".<a name=360:8></a> Think of this matter of inward control as connected with the songs of the ascent - inward control.<a name=360:9></a> Many of us may try for external control, and it is right that our members should be controlled, for the gospel has it in mind; but this is a matter of inward control in our souls, the seat of feeling and affection.<a name=360:10></a> It says, "Surely I have restrained and composed my soul, like a weaned child with its mother: my soul within me is as a weaned child".<a name=360:11></a> We are to be weaned from natural things, natural influences and their power, and this psalm has that in mind.<a name=360:12></a> The title says, "Of David", and we can see how that spirit enters into David's history.<a name=360:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first is that we are "called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord;" secondly, we "have been called to liberty;" in the third passage we are said to be called "with a holy calling;" and in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#3">Hebrews  3</a>we are said to be partakers "of the heavenly calling".<a name=369:3></a> As the Lord may help, let us look at these features in detail.<a name=369:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle, I believe, considered the defects that had crept into the assembly at Corinth.<a name=369:5></a> In the first chapter, particularly, he speaks in a somewhat abstract way, and in seeking to recover the saints to their normal position, he brings in the fact of their calling, stating that they are called saints.<a name=369:6></a> That is not exactly a title; they were saints by divine calling.<a name=369:7></a> God had called them; there could be no mistake about it.<a name=369:8></a> They were chosen in Christ before the world's foundation.<a name=369:9></a>

		In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>we get the thought of God's foreknowledge and predestination, and in accordance with that they had been called.<a name=369:10></a> It is the divine calling, which is true, dear brethren, of every true believer.<a name=369:11></a> So it is not

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Corinthian saints had departed grievously from that point, and yet the apostle could speak in abstract terms of them, saying, "The testimony of the Christ has been confirmed in you" (verse 6).<a name=370:5></a> It would be hard to see it, perhaps, had you gone there, but still he was entitled to look at the saints in all their dignity.<a name=370:6></a> And that is what is in mind, that there in Corinth, we learn the dignity of our position, that we have been called to "the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord".<a name=370:7></a> It is well that we should consider our calling - consider it.<a name=370:8></a> It is a great thing, dear brethren, to ponder over this matter.<a name=370:9></a> Why are we here?<a name=370:10></a> Why were we called?<a name=370:11></a> The apostle points out that "there are not many wise according to flesh, not many powerful, not many high-born" (verse 26).<a name=370:12></a> And the Lord said, in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11">Matthew  11</a>, that God had passed over the wise and prudent.<a name=370:13></a> It seemed right in the eyes of God, and He revealed things to babes.<a name=370:14></a> So that we are to consider our calling.<a name=370:15></a> I believe, dear brethren, it would stimulate our spirituality and our knowledge of God if we were to consider things more than we do.<a name=370:16></a> Let us take time to do it.<a name=370:17></a> We know that the character of the age is rush and toil with scarcely time to think; but I am sure that the Holy Spirit, who is with us, would help us to make time.<a name=370:18></a> It may

	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#3">Hebrews  3</a>we are told to "consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession".<a name=371:8></a> Think of the blessed Lord Jesus, the One who brought all the light and glory of God within our range as the Apostle, and who, as High Priest, maintains us, understanding us perfectly, with the greatest affection.<a name=371:9></a> He thus helps us to take in the light and to glory in it, but also to be in the power and enjoyment of the truth.<a name=371:10></a> So that we are to consider these things.<a name=371:11></a> And again it says, "Consider well him who endured so great contradiction from sinners against himself, that ye be not weary" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:3">Hebrews  12:3</a>).<a name=371:12></a> Consider the Lord Jesus, the One who suffered supremely.<a name=371:13></a> Think of His sufferings; consider Him well.<a name=371:14></a> He is the leader of our salvation who has been made perfect through sufferings.<a name=371:15></a> Well, all these things have a connection with this fellowship into which we have been called - the fellowship of God's Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.<a name=371:16></a> We are to think of Jesus - the charm of that personal name - the Man who was meek and lowly here on earth, but yet is the Christ, the chosen, the approved of God, and our Lord.<a name=371:17></a> So that we are thankful, dear brethren, to come under the authority of such a One as that, who suffered for us,

		Now Ruth is found in suitability to Boaz.<a name=397:3></a> The fruit of his love and mercy, seen operating in the second chapter, is now returning to him in appreciation.<a name=397:4></a> It is not a question of what he can do to feed her in her need, but what she can be to him for the satisfaction of his heart.<a name=397:5></a> How much it means to him!<a name=397:6></a> He says, "Blessed be thou of Jehovah, my daughter!<a name=397:7></a> .<a name=397:8></a>.<a name=397:9></a>.<a name=397:10></a> for all the gate of my people knows that thou art a woman of worth".<a name=397:11></a> Her steady course had been observed; she was marked by virtue, involving the refusal of evil, and the power to embrace good.<a name=397:12></a> The locality, the gate of the city, knows it.<a name=397:13></a> Our true weight and measure are known in our locality, where the brethren know and weigh our moral worth.<a name=397:14></a>

		Now in chapter 4 we see Boaz going up to the gate and sitting down there; and he calls upon the one who has a claim as a kinsman.<a name=397:15></a> He is given the opportunity, but he does not make good his claim; for no claim on this line is valid which does not involve the taking on of the assembly, which Ruth typifies.<a name=397:16></a> Boaz brings in Ruth from the start, and if we bring in the assembly from the commencement in all our calculations, as for instance in the meeting for care, we prove divine help.<a name=397:17></a> Boaz is well supported by these ten men of the elders of the city.<a name=397:18></a> They are immediately

		It is in such an environment that the prior claimant's poverty is exposed: "I cannot redeem it", he says.<a name=398:11></a> He was not rich enough to take over Ruth.<a name=398:12></a> We need enrichment in divine love to take to our hearts that august vessel, the assembly, and serve it in the power of that love which took Christ into death for it.<a name=398:13></a> So as Boaz takes up his claim to Ruth, we have in figure the greatest doings brought before us, and eternity brought into them in the Person of Christ.<a name=398:14></a>

		We have had cleaving, gleaning, and claiming, on the part of Ruth, and now we have building: "Jehovah make the woman that cometh into thy house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel".<a name=399:6></a> We might say that Rachel and Leah were not always together.<a name=399:7></a> What petty matters, alas, we sometimes allow to divide us!<a name=399:8></a> But here they are alluded to in the grace and dignity of spiritual builders, and that in unity.<a name=399:9></a> The fruit of their building will appear in the holy city, for the names of the sons of Israel will be in the gates.<a name=399:10></a> Ruth is to fill out this thought of building, and thus to gather up the threads of all earlier testimony and work them out in the grace of her union with Boaz, the mighty man of wealth.<a name=399:11></a> Such is the assembly's part and portion in the testimony here.<a name=399:12></a> So Obed is born, and the women said, "There is a son born to Naomi", who took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse to it, referring dispensationally to Israel in a coming day, taking into her bosom Christ as born of the remnant.<a name=399:13></a> There is a beautiful dispensational character about this book, delightful to God.<a name=399:14></a> Then how much more so is the spiritual application now to the saints of our day!<a name=399:15></a> These things are written for our learning.<a name=399:16></a> God gives us more now, in relation to Christ and the assembly, than what is yielded in the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The thought of abiding, which has been the keynote of our meetings, has left its impression on all our hearts and minds.<a name=401:1></a> This verse comes to mind as suggesting something that is exceedingly restful - the thought of abiding for eternity.<a name=401:2></a> It is not simply that we shall live for ever.<a name=401:3></a> We have through the creation of God, what we often speak of as an undying soul.<a name=401:4></a> Our existence is eternal because of the very breath of God, but this is something more than that.<a name=401:5></a> This is a question of what is utterly restful; not only secure, but restful, tranquil and joyous - the prospect that is open to us, as doing the will of God, of abiding for eternity.<a name=401:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		One of the features of the new heaven and the new earth that is first mentioned as they come into view in John's vision is that "the sea exists no more" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21:1">Revelation  21:1</a>).<a name=401:7></a> The sea, of course, has its charms; naturally, most of us love to look at it; but Scripture has named it so that we should have a judgment about it; it speaks of the troubled sea, "There is distress on the sea; it cannot be quiet" (<a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#49:23">Jeremiah  49:23</a>).<a name=401:8></a> And again, "The wicked are like the troubled sea, which cannot rest" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#57:20">Isaiah  57:20</a>).<a name=401:9></a> The sea represents what is restless; for it can be stirred by the wind of heaven.<a name=401:10></a> But in the new heaven and the new earth there is to be no more sea, suggesting a calm, tranquil state of things, which also would be conveyed in the verse read,

	<div class="paragraph">
		"... abides for eternity".<a name=402:1></a> Our eternal conditions will, no doubt, be full of holy activity, full of that for which we shall be in every way fitted, even as to our bodies, in the way of what is glorious and full of life: yet we are assured that those conditions are conditions of rest and peace.<a name=402:2></a> We shall be in the company and presence of the very God of peace, and we shall be there as consistent with the place and its whole atmosphere - "He that does the will of God abides for eternity".<a name=402:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One's thought is to illustrate briefly something of the principle of continuity and abiding from three men whose names are well known to us: David, Daniel, and John the apostle.<a name=402:4></a> These three men all have at least one thing in common, and that is that they are the subjects of love, David's name meaning 'beloved', Daniel being a "man greatly beloved", and John being "the disciple whom Jesus loved".<a name=402:5></a> But they also have other features in common, and one would suggest that one of these features is that they all did the will of God.<a name=402:6></a> It says of David that "having in his own generation ministered to the will of God, fell asleep" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#13:36">Acts  13:36</a>).<a name=402:7></a> It is also said of David that Jehovah swore to him, that his throne would continue; that it would be abiding, in that sense; there would never fail to David a man to sit upon his throne.<a name=402:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Many things could be said about David and his activities, but one would just concentrate on one feature, and that is that David knew how to face moral questions.<a name=402:9></a> He knew how to distinguish between good and evil.<a name=402:10></a> We may think, of course, of the incident of Bath-sheba and Uriah the Hittite, and we are all perhaps somewhat

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=403>[Page 403]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		surprised at David's slow reactions, until we look at our own hearts.<a name=403:1></a> But after all, they were two major matters in which he was implicated, and he came to a complete judgment of them quickly after the prophetic word came to him.<a name=403:2></a> Slow indeed he was before the prophetic word reached him, but when the word came: "Thou art the man!<a name=403:3></a>" (<a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#12:7">2 Samuel  12:7</a>), how quickly David adjusted himself - and how completely!<a name=403:4></a> What a shame it is to some of us as we think of the years of adjustment that have been needed over much lesser matters, it may be.<a name=403:5></a> How long it has taken us to arrive at the position David arrived at in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#51">Psalm  51</a>!<a name=403:6></a> And there were other matters that came up in his life, as we know; matters of good and evil; yet what marked him was that though he fell many times, he was righteous; he rose again, as it says of the righteous man.<a name=403:7></a> We think also of that great sin that took place towards the end of his life, when he numbered the people.<a name=403:8></a> Pride was ruling then - not lust, as in the earlier sin.<a name=403:9></a> Pride in his men of arms and all the resources of his kingdom seemed to come up in David's heart, and yet, before even the prophetic word reached him, David's heart smote him and he adjusted himself.<a name=403:10></a> And out of that great sin, and that great sorrow, came the designation of the house of God and the altar of Israel; the whole foundation was laid, as it were, for the glorious magnifical palace - laid in David's soul.<a name=403:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so one would commend that to the brethren, as part of the doing of the will of God; that is, that we should face up to things; that we should accept the prophetic word in its convicting power, and that we should learn to adjust ourselves even before the prophetic word reaches us.<a name=403:12></a> We
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=404>[Page 404]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		should learn to call right, Right, and wrong, Wrong, and be distinct in our judgments, and serve the will of God in our generation.<a name=404:1></a> David was beloved.<a name=404:2></a> One of the features, I believe, which God loved in David, was that though he was a sinful man (and his sins are recounted to us in more detail than of most of the beloved men of the Old Testament), yet his conscience was tender and he judged himself.<a name=404:3></a> I believe he had ever a tender conscience.<a name=404:4></a> God loves that.<a name=404:5></a> One would commend it to the younger people.<a name=404:6></a> Keep your conscience tender; have to say to God and to the Lord Jesus even about the smallest things, even about a silly speech, or a wrong thought; speak to God about it.<a name=404:7></a> Keep your conscience tender, and you will thus do the will of God.<a name=404:8></a> God delights in that, and we are assured that the person who does that shall abide for eternity.<a name=404:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we can think of Daniel as the man of whom it is said that he continued.<a name=404:10></a> He continued through many phases of the kingdom; through national upheavals, national disasters, beginning with Israel, his own nation, and then with the nation that had exalted him, for he saw Nebuchadnezzar's kingdom overthrown.<a name=404:11></a> Daniel continued through all that.<a name=404:12></a> And what marked him was purpose of heart.<a name=404:13></a> It was not exactly the facing of moral issues, though he was well able to do that - indeed, it is said of him that he confessed his sins, and the sins of his people.<a name=404:14></a> He knew how to face moral issues well, but it was not exactly that that one had in mind, but rather his purpose of heart not to pollute himself with the king's dainties.<a name=404:15></a> One would commend that.<a name=404:16></a> It is often applied to not touching worldly things, but I suggest there is more to it than that.<a name=404:17></a> It would

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		seem that Daniel deliberately adopted the policy of what we might call abstemiousness.<a name=405:1></a> Other captives took the king's dainties.<a name=405:2></a> They did not poison them; they did not die, but they were no different from any other captives.<a name=405:3></a> But Daniel and his companions on their sparse diet, by their careful adherence to the foods that would build up spiritual constitution, were distinguished.<a name=405:4></a> And it says of Daniel, immediately following on that, that he had understanding in all visions; that is, he became a vessel of light.<a name=405:5></a> And would we not like to be that, to be available for spiritual communications - as it says, in connection with a meeting like this, "Each of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a tongue, has a revelation" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14:26">1 Corinthians  14:26</a>)?<a name=405:6></a> Well, I believe we impede revelations by not being abstemious, by going in too heartily and too well for the good things of this life, for things that would perhaps dull our senses, making us heavy of understanding.<a name=405:7></a> One would commend it to the brethren as part of doing the will of God.<a name=405:8></a> The Nazarite, you remember, was to abstain from certain things.<a name=405:9></a> They were things that were lawful for other men to take and enjoy and have no conscience about at all.<a name=405:10></a> But the Nazarite was to keep from those.<a name=405:11></a> As the result of doing so there came in the priestly blessing.<a name=405:12></a> And, as the result of Daniel's abstemiousness (fasting, if you like, though he did not abstain from food, he was just careful) he received light from God.<a name=405:13></a> His was a plain diet, an uninteresting diet, speaking naturally, but it kept him free for holy and divine communications.<a name=405:14></a> Later in life he really fasted - ate no pleasant bread - and greater visions still came to him.<a name=405:15></a> He did the will of God.<a name=405:16></a> "He that does the will of God abides for eternity".<a name=405:17></a>

		<a name=406>[Page 406]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then we come to John.<a name=406:1></a> How much could be said as to John, the disciple whom Jesus loved!<a name=406:2></a> One would just commend one feature and leave all else.<a name=406:3></a> The Spirit of God would surely remind us of anything that we need reminding of, but one thinks of John as a contemplator.<a name=406:4></a> We think of the will of God as requiring energy and activity, and so it does, at times.<a name=406:5></a> It requires the sword at times.<a name=406:6></a> At other times it requires that we tread the same dreary routine for years - like Moses who led the flock of Jethro in the wilderness for forty years.<a name=406:7></a> He was doing the will of God.<a name=406:8></a> It may be that, to our minds, doing the will of God is a matter of exploits, but the Lord is careful to show us that Mary, sitting at His feet, was doing the will of God.<a name=406:9></a> She had chosen the good part.<a name=406:10></a> And John was, if we may so say, a sitter.<a name=406:11></a> He could be active; he and James were called Boanerges; he was one of the sons of thunder; he could be active, if necessary, but he was a contemplator, and the scriptures that have come before us in these last two days show what a contemplator can be under the hand of the Holy Spirit.<a name=406:12></a> What he can describe!<a name=406:13></a> What depths he can enter into!<a name=406:14></a> What things open up to his gaze as he contemplates!<a name=406:15></a> "We have contemplated his glory" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:14">John  1:14</a>).<a name=406:16></a> And <i>we</i> need to do that, we need to take time for it.<a name=406:17></a> It is difficult to find time, I know, but one was very interested in the suggestion this afternoon, that in Ezekiel's temple there are numbers of cells.<a name=406:18></a> They were to be used for various purposes, but one use was feeding on the offerings (see <a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#42:13">Ezekiel  42:13</a>).<a name=406:19></a> They were small cells, undoubtedly, thirty of them "were upon the pavement" (<a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#40:17">Ezekiel  40:17</a>).<a name=406:20></a> They would be small, possibly individual cells.<a name=406:21></a> The priests serving in the temple system, serving in

	<div class="paragraph">
		the sanctuary, had these places of immediate retreat into which they could go - the service still proceeding, but the priests meditating.<a name=407:1></a> And, while one would not encourage independent lines of thought - far from it - nevertheless as we are together let us meditate, let us ponder the things that are coming to our ears.<a name=407:2></a> Let us ponder the hymn we have just sung, and the thanksgiving to which we have just said, 'Amen'.<a name=407:3></a> As we ponder these things and contemplate, visions of glory will open up to us; we shall be the more fitted for our own part in the service; we shall be doing the will of God, and "he that does the will of God abides for eternity".<a name=407:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One trusts that we may have a deeper apprehension of what it is to do the will of God.<a name=407:5></a> There are many, many matters relating to the will of God, but one would just stress that they are not all active matters.<a name=407:6></a> The judgment of evil in myself is an active matter; I need to be busy about it.<a name=407:7></a> I need, too, to apply the sharp knife of circumcision to myself.<a name=407:8></a> That is a matter of activity.<a name=407:9></a> The matter of abstemiousness is, perhaps, not particularly an active matter, but rather one of restraint, constant restraint in things that may appeal to us; as Paul says, "I buffet my body, and lead it captive" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#9:27">1 Corinthians  9:27</a>).<a name=407:10></a> We are not monastics, but we must be careful that our bodies should be available to the Holy Spirit.<a name=407:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And so this matter of contemplation; of witnessing things, and turning them over in our minds.<a name=407:12></a> What a beautiful combination it was, that Mary and John should live their lives together after the Lord Jesus died - Mary who pondered things in her heart, and John who
