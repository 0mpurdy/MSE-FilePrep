		I desire, at this time, that the Lord may give us help together to speak of the fidelity of the love of Christ.<a name=1:1></a> I think we must feel that in regard of the love of Christ we touch a theme of peculiar blessedness and sweetness.<a name=1:2></a> At the same time, we cannot consider the subject without also feeling that we are drawing near to that which, with all its sweetness, must inevitably be very searching to our hearts.<a name=1:3></a> I shall take a human illustration in a simple way.<a name=1:4></a> I might say that in regard of human affection, where there is a pure tie between souls, there will always be the desire that the expression of it should be heard and understood.<a name=1:5></a> One thing that marks the love of Christ, beloved, is its intensely plain speaking, and that touches us in many ways.<a name=1:6></a> But in whatever way it may touch our spirits, it always has the great end in view of its own satisfaction, and connected with that, the satisfaction of the Father's heart.<a name=1:7></a>

		It was the plain speaking and inquiry of the love of Christ that tested the spirit of Peter so intensely.<a name=1:8></a> Even in the ways of the Lord with ourselves, and I touch on it with all affection, we may find the Lord speaking very plainly to us.<a name=1:9></a> We may be, for various reasons, inclined to interpret His speaking to us thus more on the line of His lordship, than of His affection and care for us.<a name=1:10></a> Often times the Lord may speak plainly to us, and it is of all moment to us that we should hear.<a name=1:11></a> But there is danger lest we might too

		readily interpret the Lord's plain speaking as only bearing on matters that would show our contrariety to His mind, and the fact that they were out of line with His own pleasure and rights as Lord.<a name=2:1></a> But there are times when the Lord speaks with intense plainness, when, if we knew the truth, we should know it was not so much that He was drawing attention to existing wrongs, as to the fact that even on the line of rectitude, there may be a lack of intensity and warmth of affection to Himself.<a name=2:2></a>

		It is insufferable to the heart of Christ that there should be remoteness -- distance -- on our part.<a name=2:3></a> We may incline to it, but the longer we remain there, the more accustomed to it we become, and the more disinclined to leave it, but the love of Christ will not endure distance.<a name=2:4></a> The institution of the Supper, the service of feet-washing, the service and care of the Lord immediately on His resurrection, in regard of Mary Magdalene particularly, and the dealings of the Lord with Peter at the close of His pathway here, are the plain speaking of the love of Christ that will not endure remoteness.<a name=2:5></a> I know of nothing that one becomes so accustomed to, with all one's knowledge of the truth, as the tendency to live in heart at a distance from the Lord.<a name=2:6></a> To know the things that are His pleasure and interest, to know the things that are changelessly dear to Himself, and yet, as to our personal links with Him, to be remote, could never satisfy His heart.<a name=2:7></a>

		I should like to go over with you, as the Lord may help us, the movements of the love of Christ, as indicated in the scriptures referred to.<a name=2:8></a> As the Lord drew near to the close of His pathway, with His own outlook before Him -- death, and what death meant to Him -- and to the great end

		that was to be the final and culminating testimony of His love to the Father, and His love to, and interest in, His own -- one is deeply impressed with the way in which the Lord moved as to the passover and the Supper.<a name=3:1></a> I do not know that I should be justified in taking for granted that every soul here distinguishes between these, but I think it might suffice if I say this in passing, that while we need the passover and the Supper, and each has its place, nevertheless, when we have distinguished between the two, we might lack the consideration of exercised affection for the Lord, that looks into the matter to see what bearing one has on the other.<a name=3:2></a> When we come together on the first day of the week, to answer to the Lord's desire as the One who laid down His life for us, we would surely, if ordered aright, come together in moral conditions that have been produced by the keeping of the feast together.<a name=3:3></a> Is there in our hearts a sufficient recognition of the fact, that when we come together to answer to the Lord in the Supper, we do not come together to create conditions, but to answer to the Lord in the power of conditions present with us?<a name=3:4></a> In whatever way we may order or regard the occasion, we may rest assured of this, that there is that in the Supper which touches our spirits in a peculiarly tender, and searching way.<a name=3:5></a> In many ways we have been tested, when we have come to take the Supper, and have been made to feel, more than in any other way, how searching was the scrutiny of the love of Christ.<a name=3:6></a> But it was not instituted that we might be searched, or made to feel the remissness of our affection for the Lord.<a name=3:7></a> It was instituted that what is due to the Lord Himself, in response to His great and precious

		I draw your attention for a moment to the necessity with the saints at Corinth, that the apostle should recall their attention particularly to the passover at the outset of his epistle.<a name=4:2></a> He says, "our passover, Christ, has been sacrificed" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5:7">1 Corinthians  5:7</a>).<a name=4:3></a> Was there ever such a Passover?<a name=4:4></a> Paul does not bring it to bear upon them simply to make a distinction between it and the Supper, but in order that their hearts might be freshly exercised as to the bearing of the feast on themselves.<a name=4:5></a> He says, "So that let us celebrate the feast .<a name=4:6></a>.<a name=4:7></a>.<a name=4:8></a> with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth" (verse 8).<a name=4:9></a> Whether in respect of the Lord Himself, or in respect of one another, as bound up together with the Lord and His interests, may we be exercised that in all our goings, in all our thoughts of the saints in secret, or when together, and in our prayers for those who are precious to the Lord, that all might be maintained with us in sincerity and truth, for there is nothing that so leads souls astray from the line that pleases the Lord as the lack of these.<a name=4:10></a> Individuals, even souls together, may make mistakes or be diverted, but the Lord places great value on sincerity of heart.<a name=4:11></a>

		Sincerity, in its simple meaning is this, that if I <i>say</i> I am going a certain way, then I go that way.<a name=4:12></a> If I <i>say</i> I am seeking certain things (the Lord sees my heart), then I seek these things.<a name=4:13></a> The Lord knows I may slip and fail in my footsteps, but sincerity and truth imply that what the lips say, the heart really knows to be true.<a name=4:14></a> It is not a matter of saying we love the Lord more than we do, or the brethren more than we do.<a name=4:15></a> Sincerity and truth are that we love them

		I believe that when we come together to the Supper to answer to the Lord, even though there may be a sense of the need of the Lord's present grace, in regard of temporal things and needs, yet He, blessed be His name, gives the grace not only to rise above that, but also that an answer may be provided in simple response to His precious love.<a name=5:4></a> One wishes to speak simply of the Supper as that which marks the great love of the heart of Christ.<a name=5:5></a> What a serious thing it would be for our hearts if ever there came a time with us, when the Supper became common!<a name=5:6></a> Every heart can answer for itself whether there be any such tendency with it.<a name=5:7></a> It should ever have in our hearts the greatness of the place that the love of Christ has given it.<a name=5:8></a> Not a place as an ecclesiastical centre, not a thing which is the centre of one ecclesiastical setting, or another, but that which is the most precious and most searching of all things.<a name=5:9></a> For it raises a constant question with us as to whether our hearts are right with the Lord, as His heart is with ours.<a name=5:10></a> The question raised by the love of Christ is; where our hearts are.<a name=5:11></a> You may remember the Old Testament incident to which I refer.<a name=5:12></a> "Is thy heart right, as my heart is with thy heart?<a name=5:13></a>" (<a href="../bible/2Kings.htm#10:15">2 Kings  10:15</a>).<a name=5:14></a> This question was asked by one who was not omniscient, but who would fain know how he was regarded by another.<a name=5:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord knows our hearts omnisciently, nevertheless in the Supper there is a constant appeal to our affections, and the nature of the appeal is this, Is your heart right, as my heart is with yours?<a name=5:16></a> There will never be any change in the heart of Christ; His love is the same as when He laid

		The hour of the passover had drawn near, and there is an inquiry on the part of the disciples as to the keeping of it, but the institution of the Supper came in distinctly outside the inquiry of the disciples, it came from the Lord Himself.<a name=6:6></a> It was not their request, or desire, that initiated it.<a name=6:7></a> Who could have taken them off the ground of the passover, bound up with their affections as it was, but the Lord Himself?<a name=6:8></a> Sweetly, the Lord served them in taking their hearts outside of Judaism and all connected with it.<a name=6:9></a> The truth as we know it will make us free.<a name=6:10></a> "If therefore the Son shall set you free, ye shall be really free" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#8:36">John  8:36</a>).<a name=6:11></a> The Lord knew what those disciples needed in regard of Judaism, and He took their hearts with Himself on to new ground in the institution of the Supper.<a name=6:12></a> I connect the two morally.<a name=6:13></a> What the Lord used for the institution of the Supper was provided for the commemoration of the passover -- the bread and the wine.<a name=6:14></a> The bread and the cup speak to us of the body and blood of Christ.<a name=6:15></a> The cup speaks of the love of God.<a name=6:16></a> But I am speaking on this occasion of the Supper, not only as the Lord's provision, but of the conditions which the Lord would have on our side in fidelity to Him.<a name=6:17></a>

		If we have affection, what is the character of it?<a name=7:1></a> Is it that which stands in the power of its knowledge?<a name=7:2></a> For a moment I would attempt to make this distinction, that the Lord's appeal is not best answered to by those who know most, but by those who love most.<a name=7:3></a> Then, you say at once, that must mean of course by those who have been a long time on the way.<a name=7:4></a> No, it does not mean that, but it is really given by hearts to whom the Lord in His own Person is more than anything else, any one else, time, place, or circumstance.<a name=7:5></a> It is hearts that love the Lord for His own sake, and respond to Him out of the sense of His own love, that please the Lord best in the Supper.<a name=7:6></a>

		The more the love of Christ settles upon our spirits individually, or when together, the deeper is the sense our hearts have of the peace, the rest, of the love of Christ.<a name=8:1></a> Then we do not say things to the Lord on the line of description, but our hearts move only on the line of response, and thus we respond with a deep sense of the way we are indebted to the love of Christ.<a name=8:2></a> He instituted the Supper from His own side; it was not the suggestion of the disciples; the Lord knew they could not be without it.<a name=8:3></a> As one goes on, one feels more and more thankful that the time between the occasions of breaking bread, are just what they are and no more.<a name=8:4></a> I do not speak as if the Supper was a place of refuge; for the more we taste of the love of Christ as it is conveyed to us then, the more thankful our hearts become that the space between one occasion and the next is no longer than it is.<a name=8:5></a>

		My desire, as the Lord may help me, is to speak to you of what is involved in following the Lord.<a name=17:1></a> The thought of following the Lord must present a very great attraction to every one of us, and I think, too, that the young, whose hearts have been drawn out after Him, must also have some sense of the gravity of such a path.<a name=17:2></a> I would say at the outset that it is not a way that will be found easy naturally.<a name=17:3></a> The energy of nature, or even the strength that the knowledge of divine things as information can give, will not carry us through.<a name=17:4></a> It is a way in which we must find the help of the Lord, if we are to be walking in it for His pleasure, in fidelity, and in spiritual affection.<a name=17:5></a> I hope that I may be able to encourage your hearts before Him, as to what it is to Him for us to be found in that way, and to have before us the preciousness and value of following the Lord; and not only what it is to us, bringing light, and comfort, and preservation of mind and spirit, but what it is to Himself, bringing joy and comfort to His heart.<a name=17:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		At this juncture I shall refer to a very peculiar and sweet word employed by the psalmist at a time of very great pressure, through the attitude of men in their wickedness towards him.<a name=17:7></a> Speaking in the Spirit of Christ, and as a type of Him, he appeals to Jehovah and says, "The assembly of the violent seek after my soul".<a name=17:8></a> Then he lifts up his heart to Jehovah and says, "Shew me a token

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that precious thought is presented in the gospels as applying to us.<a name=18:7></a> In Matthew, in connection with the kingdom; in Mark, as connected with the holiness and service of God; in Luke, in regard to the testimony of divine grace; and in John, as connected with the fellowship of God according to the truth.<a name=18:8></a> In every case we come out as God's token for good to Christ, that His enemies might be ashamed.<a name=18:9></a>

		The connection that scriptures in Luke's gospel have with the thought of following Christ, may not be immediately apparent to you, but in various aspects it opens out with the view that is seen of the glory of Christ on the mount of transfiguration.<a name=19:7></a> The Lord, in His own movement, takes His disciples aside from their position here, as connected with the testimony, and as the Man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.<a name=19:8></a> He takes them with Himself to the mountain apart, and while He is in prayer, as recorded in this gospel, He is transfigured.<a name=19:9></a> The sight of the blessed Lord in that attitude is deeply touching, and to see the glory of God, in the person of Jesus, roll in as the answer to His prayer, is very affecting.<a name=19:10></a> It is not the majesty of His Person that we see here, it is His moral glory as the Man who has come to do the will of God.<a name=19:11></a>

		We have in that one blessed Person the answer to every yearning of faith, and to every spiritual desire in the Old Testament dispensation; and the answer to every utterance of the Holy Spirit, "for the spirit of prophecy is the testimony of Jesus" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#19:10">Revelation  19:10</a>).<a name=20:1></a> The glory that shines there is the glory of the Man Christ Jesus, the One whose "visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the children of men" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#52:14">Isaiah  52:14</a>).<a name=20:2></a> The One of whom the Spirit of God records the sufferings, through which the glory of God would be brought to pass abidingly.<a name=20:3></a> You will recall the word He spoke to two of His own who, discouraged by His sufferings, were turning away from the path of the testimony.<a name=20:4></a> He appeared to them on the way to Emmaus, searching their hearts and said, "O senseless and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!<a name=20:5></a> Ought not the Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory?<a name=20:6></a>" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:25">Luke  24:25</a>, 26).<a name=20:7></a> Thus the glory of Luke's gospel, is the glory that is at the end of suffering: "If indeed we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified with him" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:17">Romans  8:17</a>).<a name=20:8></a> The beloved apostle, writing to the Philippians, said, "Because to you has been given, as regards Christ, not only the believing on him but the suffering for him also" (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#1:29">Philippians  1:29</a>).<a name=20:9></a> The path of suffering is that into which we have been called, and we have not been called there because of any superiority on our part, but by the sovereignty of the love of God, and by the measureless power of His grace.<a name=20:10></a> We have been called to it, not that we may shine in any way peculiar to ourselves, but that we might come out in the mind, and spirit, and character of Christ.<a name=20:11></a> I do not wish to discourage, but it is possible to have a very great amount of light, and

		be very clear in our minds as to divine truth, and yet not be following Christ.<a name=21:1></a> It is a very serious matter to be in the circle where faith, and separateness of heart are maintained for us, and yet not to be really following the One who by His faithfulness was the Originator of it.<a name=21:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will observe in this chapter that as the Lord comes down from the mount of transfiguration, a condition of things is discovered which had crept in by reason of the fact that Jehovah, as an Object, had been lost to His people Israel.<a name=21:3></a> I apply this in principle to ourselves.<a name=21:4></a> There are many of us, young in years and young in faith, and many who are older too, and we are following in one path together, having one blessed and peerless Object.<a name=21:5></a> But let us consider together whether we are at this present moment in our soul history in the light of the truth "according as the truth is in Jesus" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:21">Ephesians  4:21</a>).<a name=21:6></a> Does that blessed Person hold our hearts as He should do?<a name=21:7></a> Is He nearer to us in a spiritual way than ever?<a name=21:8></a> Or are we in the spirit of our minds, while perhaps adding to our knowledge, less in nearness to His Person than we have experienced formerly?<a name=21:9></a> I have been greatly impressed by this fact, how possible it is to be adding to our intelligence, and yet to be drifting from His own Person.<a name=21:10></a> How possible it is to be adding to our store of knowledge, and yet not growing by the true knowledge of God.<a name=21:11></a> As we view these possibilities it moves our spirits to exercise.<a name=21:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		As the Lord descended from the mount there was brought to Him by one of the multitude, his child possessed of an unclean spirit, or as Matthew describes it, he was lunatic.<a name=21:13></a> It is very striking that that statement follows immediately upon the manifestation of the Lord's

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Spirit of God has been given to us, and His normal ministry is that our hearts may be held livingly, directly, and dependently in nearness to the Lord Himself.<a name=22:8></a> So the condition of things which the Lord found in coming down from the mount, had come in typically by reason of the Lord in His glory having been lost sight of.<a name=22:9></a> Now, figuratively, in place of the power of the Holy Spirit, there was another spirit that affected the mind and character, and controlled the succeeding generation.<a name=22:10></a> If we, who are going before others, do not manifest unquestionable proofs of walking with a living Lord, we are leaving a door open to a contrary spirit in the next generation.<a name=22:11></a>

		If we were asked by the Lord Himself, what we wanted most in the assembly, what should we say?<a name=23:2></a> Some might say, I should like to preach; others might like to teach; some, perhaps, would like to be wise; while others might desire to be available to the saints in whatever service opened to them.<a name=23:3></a> The greatest thing open to us in the assembly of God's people is to be <i>like Christ</i>.<a name=23:4></a> But there arose a reasoning among the disciples as to who should be the greatest.<a name=23:5></a> The power manifested by the Lord undoubtedly underlay their inquiry and reasonings.<a name=23:6></a> He, knowing their hearts, took a little child and set it in their midst, as an expression of what He loved best -- the thing that was nearest to His own desires, the subject of His most tender approval.<a name=23:7></a> Would any one accustomed to man's ways have expected a way like this, and a word like this?<a name=23:8></a> But if their hearts had carried forward the lesson of the glory on the mount of transfiguration, what else could they have expected but that the Lord would take a way that was entirely His own!<a name=23:9></a> Man in his greatness, and wisdom, and knowledge is set aside entirely; whereas one who has seen the glory on the mount will never desire to figure anywhere in the assembly, but in the way that Christ loves, and of which He approves.<a name=23:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The fact is, the line of following Christ begins in the assembly.<a name=23:11></a> My dear young friends, you will find that the Lord will gently lead and direct your hearts to this point -- to the assembly, as the place where you are most tested by the mind and Spirit of Christ.<a name=23:12></a> If I am in the world -- the world that is against Christ and the testimony -- and its

		In this same incident, according to Matthew, the Lord calls the attention of the disciples to the fact that unless they be converted, and become as little children, they cannot <i>see</i> the kingdom of God, let alone have greatness in it!<a name=25:4></a> That does not mean a person is not the Lord's.<a name=25:5></a> It means that in regard to the Lord's own circle, in nearness to Himself as having been converted, and become a little child, you are pursuing the kind of greatness which is greatness in His eye, and in the sight of God.<a name=25:6></a> There can be no other greatness.<a name=25:7></a> It is that upon which God had already set His approval when He said, "<i>This</i> is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight: hear him" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#17:5">Matthew  17:5</a>).<a name=25:8></a>

		I desire to speak to you simply of what God's desires are in respect of His people, and one feels the need of special grace in doing so, in order to be preserved from presenting things merely on the line of intelligence or theory.<a name=33:2></a> It is often possible to be clear in one's mind as to certain ideas in christianity, but it is not one's clarity of mind that is so important, but the measure in which our affections are in spiritual exercise.<a name=33:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I read these scriptures so that we might dwell a little upon the love of Christ, the sufferings of Christ, and the way in which the Lord delights to take account of conditions amongst His people.<a name=33:4></a> It is interesting to consider how graciously God expresses Himself to His people in the Old Testament, when giving them communications, and how pleasurable it was in His sight that there should be response from them to Himself.<a name=33:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a very searching word for each of us -- that we have to beware that we do not present ourselves empty before God.<a name=33:6></a> We may be greatly concerned as to the importance of doing right things, and that our conduct should be blameless, without flaw, and yet we may appear before the Lord empty.<a name=33:7></a> I venture to say that the heart that loves Christ will never be found empty.<a name=33:8></a> Some may think that it is our want of intelligence that is the root of the

		trouble.<a name=34:1></a> Instruction is provided for us, if we need that, but what lies at the root is that we are spiritually deficient.<a name=34:2></a> But the more the heart resides in the presence of the glory of Christ, the more do we grow in the appreciation of Himself, and we shall not then be empty.<a name=34:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In referring to these three feasts, one would desire to consider the way in which they are brought before us in these two scriptures.<a name=34:4></a> For the sake of the young, I would say that it is not with us a literal appearing before God three times in the year.<a name=34:5></a> Nor is it a matter of keeping actual feasts, whether the passover, the feast of weeks, or the feast of tabernacles.<a name=34:6></a> But it is a question of spiritual response.<a name=34:7></a> I want, therefore, in a simple way, to bring before you how there can be with us, in the power of the Holy Spirit, what answers to these feasts.<a name=34:8></a> The first, the passover, presents what is moral; the second, the feast of weeks, what is spiritual; and the third, the feast of tabernacles, what is divine.<a name=34:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Holy Spirit has furnished for our spiritual instruction these definite lines of divine teaching, so that we might increase spiritually.<a name=34:10></a> As I said, it is not a matter of keeping actual feasts.<a name=34:11></a> In <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#5:7">1 Corinthians  5:7</a>, 8, we read, "For also our passover, Christ, has been sacrificed; so that let us celebrate the feast, not with old leaven, nor with leaven of malice and wickedness, but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth".<a name=34:12></a> If we are careless, or indifferent, in respect of the passover, it will result in our going back in spirit to what is in Egypt.<a name=34:13></a> The passover is kept in the wilderness.<a name=34:14></a> It was to be the means of preserving God's people.<a name=34:15></a> He would have the sense of what was connected with the passover ever kept before them.<a name=34:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		During the whole course of the year, He would have them in continual remembrance of the month "Abib".<a name=35:1></a> We often say, I think it is time we got beyond that point; but I should pity the soul that gets beyond the passover.<a name=35:2></a> It was observed in the wilderness, and was God's means of preservation for the people from what was Egyptian and hostile to God.<a name=35:3></a> But it also had to be observed in the land.<a name=35:4></a> They were always to be solemnised in their spirits by the fact that their place in the land was entirely due to their having been covered in the passover.<a name=35:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the epistle to the Colossians, the apostle presents to the saints at Colosse the wonderful outlook, presented on the heavenly side as risen with Christ.<a name=35:6></a> In doing so he reminds them of the fact that they had been reconciled to God "in the body of his flesh through death; to present you holy and unblameable and irreproachable before it" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:22">Colossians  1:22</a>).<a name=35:7></a> That is the way the position was brought to bear upon the Colossians; it was presenting to their affections the sphere of things on the other side of the Jordan.<a name=35:8></a> He encourages them to pass over, but they could not be there on the line of the flesh, but as secured by the offering of the body of Christ.<a name=35:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is very easy to get occupied with what is Egyptian.<a name=35:10></a> Often our associations, which are perhaps full of apparent value to us, are the hindrance.<a name=35:11></a> We feel we have not the power to free ourselves from them.<a name=35:12></a> That should be a most serious consideration for us.<a name=35:13></a> If we are desirous of being free from what is Egyptian, are our hearts tied or held by what is contrary to God's rest?<a name=35:14></a> When Moses, the leader of God's people, recounts the passage of the children of Israel from the land of Egypt, he says they "removed from

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Many a heart has gone out of Egypt at the start, in the enthusiasm of evangelical conditions, and afterwards it has begun to feel that in leaving Egypt, it had left what was living instead of what is dead.<a name=36:5></a> Egypt is a giant burying-place; their occupation that of burying their dead.<a name=36:6></a> What a solemn sight in the eyes of Moses, was the thought of his heart in bringing it afresh before the people of God at the close of Deuteronomy!<a name=36:7></a> How have we left Egypt?<a name=36:8></a> Have we left it with regrets, with any lingerings in respect of its things?<a name=36:9></a> You will recall the incident of the children of Israel murmuring in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#11:4">Numbers  11:4</a> - 6.<a name=36:10></a> They said, "Who will give us flesh to eat?<a name=36:11></a> We remember the fish that we ate in Egypt for nothing; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic; and now our soul is dried up: there is nothing at all but the manna before our eyes".<a name=36:12></a> The Spirit of God challenges them as to whether there had ever been any time that they had been in trouble when He had not come in for them.<a name=36:13></a>

		In the passage we read in Acts we find Paul staying with Aquila and Priscilla because he was of the same craft; they were tent-makers.<a name=52:3></a> Think of the great apostle working at tent-making!<a name=52:4></a> It shows his acceptance of the governmental ordering of God.<a name=52:5></a> Aquila and Priscilla had come from Rome.<a name=52:6></a> Was it a movement directly ordered of the Lord?<a name=52:7></a> No.<a name=52:8></a> Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome, and these two accepted it as under the government of God; and as accepting it they found themselves in the direct line of the testimony.<a name=52:9></a> We need to accept the governmental dealings of God in connection with our limitations in circumstances of life and health.<a name=52:10></a> As accepting the governmental limitations prescribed by God, we find ourselves in the line of the testimony.<a name=52:11></a>

		I come now to the thought of households.<a name=53:2></a> There is a good deal said as to households in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#18">Acts  18</a>.<a name=53:3></a> In verse 7 the apostle enters into a man's house which was by the synagogue, and the chief ruler of the synagogue believed on the Lord with all his house.<a name=53:4></a> In chapter 16, too, the house of Lydia is referred to, and also the house of the Philippian jailor.<a name=53:5></a> In the epistle to the Corinthians the households of Chloe and Stephanas are referred to.<a name=53:6></a> The households of the saints obviously have a great place in connection with the testimony.<a name=53:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We see in the book of Numbers that each tent formed part of a camp, and the camps were arranged round the tabernacle; so that each tent had its own place in reference to the defence and maintenance of the testimony.<a name=53:8></a> It becomes a practical question.<a name=53:9></a> It is often in the houses of the saints that Satan sees a weak point and he gets in.<a name=53:10></a> But our houses should be descriptive of God's house.<a name=53:11></a> The epistles to Timothy show that most clearly.<a name=53:12></a> Let us read <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#5:4">1 Timothy  5:4</a>, "If any widow have children or descendants, let them learn first to be pious as regards their own house, and to render a return on their side to their parents; for this is acceptable in the sight of God".<a name=53:13></a> What a lesson for us all.<a name=53:14></a> Our home is where we first learn to work things out.<a name=53:15></a> It is often said that if you want to know a man you must live with him and see how he acts in the home.<a name=53:16></a> What testimony do you give in your home, as a brother, a daughter, a son, a father, a mother, a husband, or a wife?<a name=53:17></a> We are to show piety at home.<a name=53:18></a> How important it is for the children to requite their parents.<a name=53:19></a> The home is the first

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there is the order of the house.<a name=54:3></a> Many a house is ruined because the brother does not take his place as head.<a name=54:4></a> Another house may be ruined because a sister seeks to be head, which is disastrous.<a name=54:5></a> The whole thing should be ordered according to the divine pattern; it is in that way the scripture is fulfilled which says, "<i>Ye</i> are the salt of the earth; .<a name=54:6></a>.<a name=54:7></a>.<a name=54:8></a> <i>Ye</i> are the light of the world" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#5:13">Matthew  5:13</a>, 14), that is, testimony.<a name=54:9></a> But we are also the salt of the earth.<a name=54:10></a> In this world everything natural is violated.<a name=54:11></a> There is a heartless disregard of affection, and violation of the most sensitive feelings.<a name=54:12></a> We only need to look round and see what is going on to observe how awfully corrupt things are becoming.<a name=54:13></a> Affections are violated and engagements snapped.<a name=54:14></a> Is that christianity?<a name=54:15></a> We need not go into the intense and awful forms things have taken in this world.<a name=54:16></a> What is natural is preserved in the christian circle in its right features.<a name=54:17></a> "Ye are the salt of the earth".<a name=54:18></a> There is the recognition of every divinely ordered relationship; it is held in a right way and God supports that and what is natural is preserved.<a name=54:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, too, the houses of the saints are the avenue by which the house of God reaches the world.<a name=54:20></a> A worldly man cannot see the house of God, because it is a spiritual house; he has no means of knowing it in its spiritual character, but he can see you and me; he can note <i>our</i> houses.<a name=54:21></a> What is that man's house like?<a name=54:22></a> Is it different from other houses?<a name=54:23></a> Are acts of grace shown there?<a name=54:24></a> Is it marked by liberality and hospitality?<a name=54:25></a> Does the kindness of God

	<div class="paragraph">
		How honoured the house of Lydia was.<a name=55:3></a> The apostle not only went there once, but he went back there.<a name=55:4></a> Then the Philippian jailor's household was baptised and brought under the rule of the Lord.<a name=55:5></a> And as we were seeing in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#18">Acts  18</a>, there are several houses mentioned.<a name=55:6></a> In the first epistle to the Corinthians we read of the household of Stephanas devoting themselves to the saints for service.<a name=55:7></a> We see thus how the testimony is maintained and defended through the households of the saints.<a name=55:8></a>

		Timothy refers very largely to the houses of the saints.<a name=56:3></a> Look at <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#2">1 Timothy  2</a>.<a name=56:4></a> I think that refers primarily to the christian household.<a name=56:5></a> Prayer marks it.<a name=56:6></a> Prayer is to be made "for kings and all that are in dignity, that we may lead a quiet and tranquil life in all piety and gravity; for this is good and acceptable before our Saviour God, who desires that all men should be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth" (verses 2 - 4).<a name=56:7></a> I believe that is particularly applicable to the household.<a name=56:8></a> I would like to ask every head of a house what his household prayer is like.<a name=56:9></a> Are you conducting family reading?<a name=56:10></a> I once asked someone what they were reading in the morning -- family reading -- and she replied, 'We don't have family reading'.<a name=56:11></a> I hope you have family reading, dear brother.<a name=56:12></a> What a terrible thing to let the household start without the public recognition of God!<a name=56:13></a> Supposing you had to have a business friend to stay with you.<a name=56:14></a> Look at the effect it would have on him, if you did not have family prayer and reading.<a name=56:15></a> He would get a wrong impression of the house of God.<a name=56:16></a> We are to pray for all men; we may also pray for God's care over our households.<a name=56:17></a> I believe household prayer is particularly in view in the epistle to Timothy.<a name=56:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And then there is to be prayer for the gospel specifically.<a name=56:19></a> Some of us have had great encouragement in gathering our household around us for prayer before the gospel preaching.<a name=56:20></a> Some of us are not privileged to be at home always, but if we are home, what an opportunity to

		Let me now turn to a few verses in 2 Timothy to show four qualities which should mark us in connection with each of these spheres.<a name=58:1></a> <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1:7">2 Timothy  1:7</a>: "For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power, and of love, and of wise discretion".<a name=58:2></a> One thing which is greatly needed in these spheres of our life is courage.<a name=58:3></a> In verse 8 the apostle says to Timothy, "Be not therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord".<a name=58:4></a> I would say to the young here specially, Do not he ashamed.<a name=58:5></a> The testimony is such that it need bring no blush to your cheek.<a name=58:6></a> We can be ashamed of much in ourselves, but we never need be ashamed of the testimony.<a name=58:7></a> Timothy was evidently a diffident, nervous young man, and to encourage him the apostle refers to Onesiphorus.<a name=58:8></a> He says, he "has not been ashamed of my chain; but being in Rome sought me out very diligently, and found me" (verses 16, 17).<a name=58:9></a> And he says to Timothy, Don't <i>you</i> be ashamed.<a name=58:10></a> We need courage.<a name=58:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And then there is suffering, "Take thy share in suffering" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:3">2 Timothy  2:3</a>).<a name=58:12></a> We are often timid and are marked by the spirit of fear because we are not prepared to suffer.<a name=58:13></a> If we are prepared to suffer as a lamb we shall be as bold as a lion.<a name=58:14></a> Then next there is understanding, <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:7">2 Timothy  2:7</a>: "Think of what I say, for the Lord will give thee understanding in all things".<a name=58:15></a> We need to know what we are suffering for.<a name=58:16></a> There is great need for thinking over what Paul says.<a name=58:17></a> The next thing is devotedness.<a name=58:18></a> A good soldier will give up everything to please the Lord.<a name=58:19></a> There is a call for devotedness today; nothing else will meet the situation.<a name=58:20></a> An insipid lukewarmness has come over the professing church, and devotedness is necessary if we are to be for the Lord and to stand for the testimony.<a name=58:21></a>

		Let us apply these four qualities, first individually and then in regard of our households.<a name=59:1></a> If a man of the world comes to see you when you are just about to start for a week-night meeting, what are you going to do?<a name=59:2></a> Supposing a worldly relative arrives.<a name=59:3></a> Is that going to stop you from going to the meeting?<a name=59:4></a> If it does, you are giving the situation away; you have allowed the Moabite to carry the situation, to use a typical expression.<a name=59:5></a> You want to express what God is like.<a name=59:6></a> Take them with you if they are willing; if not, go alone.<a name=59:7></a> You may say, It might upset them.<a name=59:8></a> Possibly, but it might mean their salvation.<a name=59:9></a> We need courage and preparedness to suffer reproach.<a name=59:10></a> Reproach helps us in a very definite way.<a name=59:11></a> We must be intelligent and devoted.<a name=59:12></a> The Lord would help us in our individual paths and in our households if we go on those lines.<a name=59:13></a>

		I come now to the thought of the assembly.<a name=59:14></a> We have our daily individual life, our households, and lastly we have our place in connection with the local assembly.<a name=59:15></a> I would like to read a passage in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:12">1 Corinthians  12:12</a> - 18: "For even as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.<a name=59:16></a> For also in the power of one Spirit <i>we</i> have all been baptised into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bondmen or free, and have all been given to drink of one Spirit .<a name=59:17></a>.<a name=59:18></a>.<a name=59:19></a> .<a name=59:20></a> Now God has set the members, each one of them in the body, according as it has pleased him".<a name=59:21></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I had in mind in reading this passage was to try and say a word to you, beloved brethren, with regard to the matter of waiting upon God.<a name=65:1></a> I believe that it is distinct from prayer, although intimately connected with it.<a name=65:2></a> That is to say, you might have prayer without waiting upon God.<a name=65:3></a> There is great blessing accruing to those who wait upon God.<a name=65:4></a> I have no doubt every one here is accustomed to praying, for there is no more delightful occupation for a believer than praying, unless it be praising, but the one is often the outcome of the other.<a name=65:5></a> To have the favour of being allowed to speak to God, and speak to the Lord in heaven, is greatly valued, I am sure, by every one.<a name=65:6></a>

		Prayer fortifies a believer as having to meet the influences of the world, and of his own heart, but what I have very much before me now is the experience of <i>waiting upon God</i>.<a name=65:7></a> Evidently there are wonderful things -- things that eye has not seen nor ear heard, nor that have entered into the heart of man -- which God has prepared for those that <i>wait</i> for Him.<a name=65:8></a> The apostle in the epistle to the Corinthians gives a beautiful touch, as showing that those that wait upon God are those that love Him.<a name=65:9></a> I believe that all the persons whom God has taken up from the beginning have been accustomed to wait upon God, and I raise the inquiry as to whether we are accustomed to wait upon God.<a name=65:10></a> I suppose we have all, in varying measure, had the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		experience that we have spoken to God about a matter, and have received no reply.<a name=66:1></a> What are you going to do?<a name=66:2></a> Are you going to abandon the pursuit, or are you going to wait upon God?<a name=66:3></a> The waiting process tests us much, but it is a most delightful experience to wait on God, with the sure and certain sense in our souls that none ever waited on God in vain.<a name=66:4></a> It is part of our education for the realm in which we are to dwell presently, that we should wait on God.<a name=66:5></a> I think Noah stands out as one who waited on God.<a name=66:6></a> Noah recoiled from the condition of things in the earth where he lived, and he took an opposite course; he was a righteous man, and God regarded him as such.<a name=66:7></a> The time came when God told him that the end of all flesh had come before Him.<a name=66:8></a> Now, God frequently indicates what He is about to do before He does it, and Noah had to learn to wait on God as to what He was about to do.<a name=66:9></a> As waiting upon God, your heart rejoices in the sense that you are in His confidence, and that you have a secret with heaven.<a name=66:10></a> It is a wonderful experience to be in the secret of God's mind.<a name=66:11></a> Noah enjoyed that, and as he built the ark, during the long period that elapsed while it was preparing, Noah was waiting upon God.<a name=66:12></a> Day by day he would no doubt commune with God as he waited upon Him.<a name=66:13></a> And even after Noah was put into the ark, and the door was shut by the hand of God, he had to wait.<a name=66:14></a> I am perfectly certain that Noah acquired, as the outcome of waiting on God, a moral greatness that distinguished him from the whole generation in which he lived.<a name=66:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then one might refer to Abraham.<a name=66:16></a> The God of glory appeared to him, as distinct from Noah.<a name=66:17></a> The God of glory appeared to him in a land of idolatry, and He called him to

	<div class="paragraph">
		Our place as brought into relation with God, in His family as His children, and in His household, gives us our privilege of waiting upon Him.<a name=67:6></a> The thought of waiting upon God far exceeds the idea of making requests to Him, and leaving it there.<a name=67:7></a> There may be requests which we make, and which we leave, but that is not waiting upon God.<a name=67:8></a> Waiting upon God is that the affections of the heart turn constantly towards Him, ever having in mind what we have spoken to Him about, or that of which He may have spoken to us.<a name=67:9></a> It may involve patience, but it is amply rewarded.<a name=67:10></a> May I ask whether we, as believers, are intimate with heaven?<a name=67:11></a> Do we know the gates, the doors?<a name=67:12></a> Do we realise that we have been called into holy intimacy with God, not to be so only when we arrive in heaven, but now?<a name=67:13></a> Do we understand this?<a name=67:14></a> In the world great prices are paid, and great efforts are put forward, in order to be allowed to speak to royal personages.<a name=67:15></a> You need pay no price to speak to God.<a name=67:16></a> It is your rightful place to be near to Him, and to commune with Him continually.<a name=67:17></a> Nothing, surely,

		can be greater in the life of a believer than to be intimate with God, and to know what it is continually to wait upon Him.<a name=68:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I might remind you of others besides Noah and Abraham: of Joseph, of David, and of many others who knew what it was to wait upon God.<a name=68:2></a> There were those who through long hours of dreary darkness knew what it was to wait upon God.<a name=68:3></a> I want you to understand that <i>none</i> ever waited on God in vain.<a name=68:4></a> As surely as the sun rises in the morning, so surely will God answer you if you wait upon Him.<a name=68:5></a> But He may keep you waiting, and the process of being kept waiting tests us all, but it educates us greatly.<a name=68:6></a> When once you have passed a period of waiting upon God -- waiting on and on, and no answer, no apparent issue -- the moment will come when the dawn will appear and the light will stream in where it was dark, and God will show you His way.<a name=68:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In the life of Jesus here, perfect though it was, great and Holy One of God as He was, there was this particular element of waiting upon God.<a name=68:8></a> Think of the Lord being in Jerusalem; He knew about His Father's business -- what great affairs were in His hands.<a name=68:9></a> Think of a boy of twelve years old in the temple.<a name=68:10></a> The One who was going to bring about the reconciliation of all things, the One who was going to effect atonement, and the One who was going to destroy the power of death and overthrow completely the whole power of evil.<a name=68:11></a> Did He not know what was before Him?<a name=68:12></a> He says, "Did ye not know that I ought to be occupied in my Father's business?<a name=68:13></a>" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:49">Luke  2:49</a>).<a name=68:14></a> Think of Him going down to Nazareth and waiting.<a name=68:15></a> Think of that One turning daily, frequently every day, turning

		I ask you, Are you really in touch with God?<a name=69:5></a> Do you know Him?<a name=69:6></a> I have found believers in obscurity.<a name=69:7></a> One comes to my mind now who lived in a little wooden cottage, who could speak in the most intimate way of having to do with God.<a name=69:8></a> Never shall I forget the look that came into her face as she spoke to me.<a name=69:9></a> She said, 'Do you think God will ever fail me?<a name=69:10></a> No', she said, 'never'.<a name=69:11></a> Are we really intimate with God, beloved?<a name=69:12></a> Do we know Him?<a name=69:13></a> God is working at the present time to bring us <i>near</i> to Him.<a name=69:14></a> We have become nigh by the blood of Christ; we all have access in the power of one Spirit.<a name=69:15></a> But do we know this nearness?<a name=69:16></a> Do we know what it is to wait upon God?<a name=69:17></a> Oh, it is lovely to get into the company of one who is accustomed to wait on God.<a name=69:18></a>

		Christ (I do not use that word as applying it to anything arbitrary as we generally understand rule), one is instructed and educated in the knowledge of God not only by what He says, for He does speak, but by influence.<a name=77:1></a> There are things to be discovered by coming under His influence, and I am sure we know something of what this is.<a name=77:2></a> Now, as I said, the Lord occupied a place in Deity and in love.<a name=77:3></a> He was an object of affection and love in eternity (<a href="../bible/John.htm#17:24">John  17:24</a>), but having come into Manhood, He became in a peculiar and unique way an Object of divine love.<a name=77:4></a> Hence He is referred to in Scripture as "The only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:18">John  1:18</a>).<a name=77:5></a> The Lord alone has that unique place, but in addition to this place which the Lord will ever hold, alone, He, as Man, is also Pattern for us, for we read, "that the world may know .<a name=77:6></a>.<a name=77:7></a>.<a name=77:8></a> that thou hast loved them as thou hast loved me" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#17:23">John  17:23</a>).<a name=77:9></a> He is now Firstborn among many brethren and brings us to share with Him, as "firstborn ones".<a name=77:10></a> God's purpose for us is that we should be conformed to the image of His Son; He sent forth His Son that we might receive sonship; and we are loved as He is loved.<a name=77:11></a>

		Referring to the first passage that I read, it would appear from the words of the prophet Isaiah that in chapter 48 there is an allusion to Cyrus, king of Persia.<a name=77:12></a> In chapter 45 also God speaks of him as being anointed.<a name=77:13></a> But though alluding to Cyrus, the chapter has Christ in view prophetically, and it says there, "He whom Jehovah hath loved".<a name=77:14></a> Now, as come into this world, the Lord came definitely to serve.<a name=77:15></a> I wish you to understand that Jesus, having come into this world took up service, and He took it up in the consciousness of being loved.<a name=77:16></a> "He whom

	<div class="paragraph">
		The scripture in Corinthians, which we read, justifies our regarding the people of God as under the figure of stars.<a name=85:1></a> You will have noticed in the book of Genesis that while the whole creation stands out as the handiwork of God, yet the stars are mentioned as an item by themselves, which will help us in what we are about to look at.<a name=85:2></a> It is said that God made the two great lights, the sun to rule by day and the moon to rule by night, and then it says, "and the stars".<a name=85:3></a> I need not remind the brethren here, I am sure, that the sun is a type of Christ, and the moon may be regarded as a type of the assembly.<a name=85:4></a> But the stars are figures of persons, viewed severally, but set in relation to Christ and each other.<a name=85:5></a>

		Now, leading along this line, we come to another range of things entirely, and I remind the brethren of an instance that is recorded in the book of Judges (chapter 4), when the king of Canaan came up against the people of God.<a name=90:1></a> What immense power he had -- great chariots of iron, and great forces against God's people.<a name=90:2></a> He had a great general in his army, as you remember, called Sisera.<a name=90:3></a> Now we have to remember that there are forces, unseen and unknown often, to us, which are against us.<a name=90:4></a> You know Satan and all his emissaries are against us.<a name=90:5></a> We have to enter into conflict, not with flesh and blood, but with the lords of darkness, who are against us because of our elevation to the heavenly places.<a name=90:6></a> That is where Satan is for the moment, and he will not tolerate that we should, in spirit and thought and affections, occupy the heavenly places.<a name=90:7></a> The Lord has gone up there.<a name=90:8></a> He has gone up far above all heavens, and Satan knows it, and he knows it is not long before he will be dislodged, and so he is against us.<a name=90:9></a> Now God's people appealed to Jehovah, and God took up two women, one of whom was a notable sister, Deborah; and God will often take up the sisters.<a name=90:10></a> Perhaps we brothers do not realise the place the sisters have, but we have to come to it.<a name=90:11></a> God will often, in an assembly, take up sisters, and He will work in them and through them, so that a victory is secured.<a name=90:12></a> That has happened more than once; and what the Lord showed in reference to this conflict of the king of Canaan with the people of God, was that the stars fought against Sisera.<a name=90:13></a> Deborah in her wonderful song alludes to it.<a name=90:14></a>

		RESTFULNESS IN THE PRESENCE OF CHRIST

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#45:1">Genesis  45:1</a> - 8
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I desire to refer to in speaking of this passage of scripture is the need for restfulness in having to do with the Lord.<a name=95:1></a> I am not now referring quite to our side of matters.<a name=95:2></a> It is desirable indeed that we should be at rest in drawing near to the Lord; but what I have rather more in mind is His drawing near to us; and with that in view I have referred to this incident in Joseph's history.<a name=95:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not think that we perhaps value as we should the intensity of the Lord's desires to be with us, and to have us at home with Him.<a name=95:4></a> I am not speaking exclusively of the occasion of the Lord's supper, when the Lord Jesus may come to assembled saints.<a name=95:5></a> But I am speaking of the occasions when the Lord manifestly draws near to His people, in order to speak to them, and I am convinced that all will agree that the gain of the Lord's address to us is not possible if we are not at home with Him.<a name=95:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now how wonderful it is that there are emotions, deep, measureless emotions in the heart of Jesus towards us.<a name=95:7></a> Think of that, think of the Personage as typified in Joseph.<a name=95:8></a> You might have said Joseph has enough to satisfy him in Egypt.<a name=95:9></a> Look at the pomp and splendour surrounding his place in the court, think of the eminence in which he is as the saviour of the world, and the revealer of secrets.<a name=95:10></a> But these were more or less official positions, dignities which invested him; and one might speak of the
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		place of glory in which Jesus is in heaven.<a name=96:1></a> He has a glory in heaven surpassing the accumulated glory of all others.<a name=96:2></a> That is the glory which rests upon His brow in heaven, the once crucified, despised and hated Man -- what a place!<a name=96:3></a> He has dignities investing Him.<a name=96:4></a> He has official glories in that place of light superb.<a name=96:5></a> You might say, 'Lord Jesus, these are enough to satisfy Thee'.<a name=96:6></a> No.<a name=96:7></a> What about these few shepherds who had come into the land of Egypt?<a name=96:8></a> That was where Joseph's heart lay; they were his brethren.<a name=96:9></a> Christ has in heaven glories, yet there are affections in that wonderful heart that can only be satisfied in having our companionship.<a name=96:10></a> What a wondrous consideration that is.<a name=96:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The arrival of the brethren of Joseph as he looked on them stirred the emotions of his heart, so that he had to cry, "Put every man out from me" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#45:1">Genesis  45:1</a>).<a name=96:12></a> The ministry of the truth in the power of the Spirit, from Christ in glory has in view to cause these elements in us, elements of the flesh, to go out.<a name=96:13></a> Now the question is, is every man going out?<a name=96:14></a> All that belongs to us as of this world is a distinct hindrance to the manifestation of Christ amongst His people.<a name=96:15></a> One Egyptian remaining there would have restrained the intense emotions of the heart of Joseph.<a name=96:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the ministry of the truth which we have received -- many of us for many years -- is, in the Lord's mind, to the intent that every man should go out.<a name=96:17></a> Now have we heard that voice of power, "Put every man out from me?<a name=96:18></a>" That was the command from the lips of Joseph.<a name=96:19></a> It was not a question now of disapproval of these elements, of these persons.<a name=96:20></a> It was that there were such intense emotions in the heart of Joseph that the presence of Egyptians, the presence of persons who were unsympathetic, would have
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=97>[Page 97]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		restrained them, would have hindered him, and so he gave this command, put every man out.<a name=97:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now are we prepared to disallow the flesh -- are we prepared for that?<a name=97:2></a> It is a searching question, beloved brethren.<a name=97:3></a> I feel it deeply for myself, because the element of the world which is in us, and clings to us interferes with what the Lord desires to do; He desires to make Himself known to us.<a name=97:4></a> What a thing that this great and exalted Personage desires to make Himself known.<a name=97:5></a> He is not seeking the courts of the world, He is not knocking at any palace doors, He is knocking at the doors of our hearts, and He says, "Put every man out".<a name=97:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		They went out, and the pent-up emotions of the heart of Joseph found an outlet in loud weeping -- weeping of intense emotion, intense joy, and I think one has discerned the evidences of the Lord's intense emotions as having liberty to come among His people.<a name=97:7></a> You may say, 'I know nothing about that'.<a name=97:8></a> There is a reason for that.<a name=97:9></a> This priceless joy which is within the reach of every believer is only known at the cost of surrender.<a name=97:10></a> If we are harbouring and clinging to what belongs to us as in the flesh, clinging to what we may be naturally; whether it be in talents, or attainments, or social rank in this world, it is a hindrance to the most wonderful joy that believers here can ever know; the manifestation of the Lord Jesus in the intensity of His love for His own.<a name=97:11></a> That is what He is seeking in the assembly.<a name=97:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You understand now that I am speaking of movements on the Lord's side towards us, and not of movements on our side towards Him.<a name=97:13></a> The emotions of the heart of Christ are so precious that they cannot be divulged in the

		presence of Egyptians, so He says, "Put every man out".<a name=98:1></a> He gave vent to his love in loud weeping, and the Egyptians heard and the house of Pharaoh heard.<a name=98:2></a> It is not too much to say that this world has heard the joy that is known in the assembly, has known that such a thing is.<a name=98:3></a> It may have no intelligence in regard to it, but the thing is known, it has had its effect in the world.<a name=98:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now that is the move on the part of Joseph to make himself known.<a name=98:5></a> The Egyptians have been disposed of -- they have gone out.<a name=98:6></a> We are walking in a path of separation from the world, I hope.<a name=98:7></a> If not it is high time to begin, and it is not too late to begin.<a name=98:8></a> The cleavage between us and the world must be absolute in heart.<a name=98:9></a> The taking of the Lord's supper, if it is understood, is an avowal publicly, that Jesus is our Lord.<a name=98:10></a> That is the meaning of the Lord's supper; it is the Lord's supper.<a name=98:11></a> All of us here who are the Lord's have passed very definitely from the kingdom of darkness, to the kingdom of the Son of God's love.<a name=98:12></a> Supposing I went over to France, and petitioned the authorities that I desired now henceforth to be a citizen of the French Republic.<a name=98:13></a> I renounce every right here, and I take some steps to avow my allegiance to that government.<a name=98:14></a> Now the crossing over from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of the Son of God's love is as real as that, and more so.<a name=98:15></a> Have we passed over?<a name=98:16></a> On the Lord's Day we eat that bread, and we drink of that cup, as a definite avowal that Jesus is Lord.<a name=98:17></a> The days that follow are to be in correspondence with that; otherwise the situation is dishonest -- it is unreal.<a name=98:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So we have caused the Egyptians to go out, I trust.<a name=98:19></a> Joseph discovers now that there is another element to be dealt with.<a name=98:20></a> It says here, "His brethren could not answer

	<div class="paragraph">
		We were speaking this afternoon of certain manifestations of the Spirit that take place in the assembly of God, in relation to the body of Christ.<a name=99:6></a> When the Lord manifests Himself in the way of ministry, or in the way of His presence as coming among us, there are occasions when those who are there are troubled.<a name=99:7></a> I suppose we all know what it is to have sat uneasily during an address.<a name=99:8></a> Sometimes a word of ministry causes uneasiness.<a name=99:9></a> Why?<a name=99:10></a> If the Lord speaks, if He speaks in a voice of thunder, we are not disturbed unless there be some secret question there that has never been touched.<a name=99:11></a> Is this condition of things obtaining among us, beloved brethren?<a name=99:12></a> Do allow me to talk plainly and affectionately.<a name=99:13></a> Are any troubled at His presence?<a name=99:14></a> Have you a good conscience?<a name=99:15></a> Are you silent in the assembly?<a name=99:16></a> That is abnormal.<a name=99:17></a> The Lord's desire is that all should come near to Him, and the Lord's voice is heard in the assembly in the way of ministry, or He may pursue His own ends by the Holy Spirit in a manifestation.<a name=99:18></a> The Lord speaks in a remarkable way on occasions to His people.<a name=99:19></a> But He does it for what?<a name=99:20></a> So that all distance may be removed.<a name=99:21></a>

		Now in the last chapter of Leviticus we have the matter of estimation according to God, and estimation according to the valuation of the priest.<a name=106:1></a> Doubtless you have noticed in reading the passage, that the valuation of the male differs from that of the female.<a name=106:2></a> At your leisure it will interest you to note the difference between the valuations; they are not regular.<a name=106:3></a> According to age, the valuation of the male and the female differs.<a name=106:4></a> I believe the spiritual meaning of the valuation of the male and the female suggests for us the valuation according to what we are according to divine purpose.<a name=106:5></a> The valuation according to what we are in God's ways here; that is the measure of what is actually wrought in us, what is entered into by us.<a name=106:6></a> You might say to me that every one is valued alike.<a name=106:7></a> Well, every one stands in divine favour, and stands before God in divine righteousness; all stand in the blessedness of what Christ is as risen.<a name=106:8></a> But you must understand that when it comes to a question of the world to come, and possibly eternity, there are variations.<a name=106:9></a> For instance, when one thinks of the apostle Paul, the great place that he has in relation to the divine structure, one will readily conceive that he has a distinctive place in valuation, even in relation to the ways of God on earth, and the assembly of God.<a name=106:10></a> But speaking of matters in the main, the valuation of the male and female, has respect to the place divinely given to us according to the purpose of God, and the place we have in relation to the formation wrought here in us in the power of the Spirit.<a name=106:11></a> The valuation all through in the male is higher, showing that the place we have in the divine reckoning, and the estimation in respect to the place divinely given according

		I want to press the thought that it is at the point where salvation is brought to the house that the Lord, so to speak, feels that He can safely leave His interests in the charge of His bondmen.<a name=143:6></a> It is a very sobering thought to contemplate that the Lord Jesus has left all His interests in the charge of His people.<a name=143:7></a> What He will receive on His return is dependent on what His people do during His absence.<a name=143:8></a> I do not suggest that if I am unfaithful the Lord will lose in the end.<a name=143:9></a> I do not think it would be right to suggest that, because if I am unfaithful He can give grace to another to do what He meant me to do.<a name=143:10></a> But considering saints as a whole, I would be prepared to say this, that what the Lord will receive on His return is dependent on their faithfulness.<a name=143:11></a> Now that is sobering.<a name=143:12></a> We often think that the

		Luke brings in responsibility.<a name=144:5></a> The parable in this chapter does not, so far as I understand it, bring in the idea of gift as in Matthew's gospel.<a name=144:6></a> Luke's parable speaks of minas -- a small amount of money, and each bondman receives the same amount.<a name=144:7></a> It is not a question of capacity, as in Matthew.<a name=144:8></a> Matthew brings in talents and capacity, but Luke's parable brings in responsibility; and I would say to every believer in this room, The Lord has left you with the responsibility of taking care of His interests.<a name=144:9></a> You may have thought that if you are unfaithful it will only mean that you will lose a little of the blessing that might have been yours.<a name=144:10></a> But as I read this passage, this parable, I see the danger, not of losing a little bit of the blessing, but of <i>losing it all</i>.<a name=144:11></a> You may say, Can a believer lose his eternal blessing?<a name=144:12></a> I do not suggest that.<a name=144:13></a> I am taking the parable in its connection and in its import and I am increasingly afraid of taking away the edge of the Word by importing into any Scripture something that is not there.<a name=144:14></a> I see within the range of this teaching the clear possibility of losing all that has been given to me in the sphere of responsibility.<a name=144:15></a>

		Now what follows gives us a suggestion of how the trading can be carried on in a day of weakness.<a name=147:2></a> I allude to what the Lord told the man who had done no trading.<a name=147:3></a> He said to him, "And why didst thou not give my money to the bank; and <i>I</i> should have received it, at my coming, with interest?<a name=147:4></a>" (verse 23).<a name=147:5></a> A bank is a suggestion for feeble folk, timid people.<a name=147:6></a> A trader is a man who goes out on a venture; he has large things in view, and he gets large profits if successful.<a name=147:7></a> But a bank is an opening for weak people, such as we are.<a name=147:8></a> We live in a day of intense weakness, and we are all weak; there is not a strong man in this room.<a name=147:9></a> We are all weak.<a name=147:10></a> And a bank is such a comfortable thought for those that live in days of weakness; it is a place of security, but it bears interest.<a name=147:11></a> You see the Lord will not be satisfied if there is no interest.<a name=147:12></a> It is interest He wants -- increase.<a name=147:13></a> He will not be satisfied, He will not commend us, if there is no interest, and the bank is the place that yields interest and security.<a name=147:14></a> I commend it to the brethren.<a name=147:15></a> I will tell you what the bank is.<a name=147:16></a> The bank is the fellowship.<a name=147:17></a> The same word in the first epistle to the Corinthians is translated "table" -- the table of the Lord.<a name=147:18></a> It is the same word.<a name=147:19></a> It is the fellowship.<a name=147:20></a> Timid people, weak people, can trade in the fellowship amongst the saints.<a name=147:21></a> Whatever you put in there will bear interest, it will never be lost.<a name=147:22></a> I will give you a suggestion from John's gospel as to how the Lord viewed this thought; I will call it the thought of the bank.<a name=147:23></a> He was about to leave this scene.<a name=147:24></a> When a man is leaving this scene his first thoughts are for his family, those that have been dependent upon him, as to

		Now a trader, one who is seeking how to enlarge his interests, would be available to the Lord to go and loose these colts and bring them to Jesus.<a name=149:19></a> Could there be a greater privilege than that?<a name=149:20></a> To find souls that are tied and bound and shackled, all because their wills are not broken, because they are not subject to Him, because they will not walk according to the light; to find them in fetters, awaiting the moment when they can be liberated and be available to Him.<a name=149:21></a> Oh, that is a splendid way of trading.<a name=149:22></a> It will bring large results; it will bring you cities in the day to come.<a name=149:23></a> What will give us capacity to rule over cities?<a name=149:24></a> I will tell you.<a name=149:25></a> It is not reading out notices in the meeting, and it

		I believe that the choosing of the Levites is what we might call a sovereign movement on God's part.<a name=158:1></a> There are many such movements indicated in Scripture, where God makes a movement entirely on His own part, and when He does, it is always of interest.<a name=158:2></a> We are so prone to sit down as regards God's sovereign movements and to say, 'He does as He pleases', or 'He gives gifts to this one and that one entirely at His own pleasure'.<a name=158:3></a> So He does; but in His choosing the Levites in lieu of the first-born, you see how beautifully the word of God connects devotedness and faithfulness on the part of man, with what God is pleased to do in all the sovereignty of His acting.<a name=158:4></a> That is, Scripture first presents the Levites' devotion and consecration to God, and then God's movement in choosing them for Himself subsequently.<a name=158:5></a> Now God chooses them in lieu of the first-born, so that every Levite stands in all the dignity of a first-born one.<a name=158:6></a> You will remember that there were not enough Levites to ransom the first-born ones, and that five shekels of silver had to be paid for the number of Levites that was short of the number of the first-born, but every one of them stands before God in all the dignity of a first-born one.<a name=158:7></a>

		Doubtless what I have mentioned is well known to all here, but I am making these remarks about the Levites to gather the factors together, so that we might see the atmosphere and setting in which the peculiar service of the Levites is detailed.<a name=158:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two features about this service that we should note.<a name=158:9></a> One is that all Levitical service is related to the tabernacle.<a name=158:10></a> There is not a single item of Levitical service that you can disconnect from the tabernacle

		system.<a name=159:1></a> The other is that all that character of service was to be subject to priestly oversight.<a name=159:2></a> I refer now to the former and I think you will see the importance of it, for how much service there is today amongst God's people -- service manward -- Levitical in character, which is disconnected and dissociated from the tabernacle system.<a name=159:3></a> How much effort there is amongst the people of God to benefit man, effort that has in view no more than man's blessing.<a name=159:4></a> Dear brethren, every Levite, in all the dignity of a first-born one, should have such an appreciation of the tabernacle, and of his service as connected with it, that he would not, as it were, stretch forth his hand to benefit any man, without having the tabernacle in view.<a name=159:5></a> How much preaching of the gospel there is that has no thought, no exercise, no prayer, in connection with the tabernacle system!<a name=159:6></a> The gospel in its true setting, in the setting which Scripture gives it, has that object always in view.<a name=159:7></a> God effects His own purpose by it, in bringing the material for the tabernacle system to light.<a name=159:8></a> As every gospel preacher is a Levite, he should have in view, in all his service manward, that the material for God's system should be brought to light, and that it should be set in its proper place.<a name=159:9></a> I wonder if we realise, dear brethren -- one feels one's weakness in this regard -- that God is working systematically.<a name=159:10></a> He is working according to certain great schemes that are in His own blessed mind, not working in a haphazard manner, but with design, having the great system of service in view which is going to minister to Himself, because every part of it is to speak of Christ.<a name=159:11></a> Now I thought that with this in mind, we shall see how important it is that every Levite should be instructed in his

		work.<a name=160:1></a> He should know what material is to be of service in the tabernacle.<a name=160:2></a> He should know how to carry it and bear it through the wilderness.<a name=160:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second great point of Levitical service, as it presents itself to my mind at this moment, is this, that all Levitical service, as I said, was subject to priestly oversight.<a name=160:4></a> We read "The prince of princes of the Levites was Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest: he had the oversight of them" (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#3:32">Numbers  3:32</a>).<a name=160:5></a> There is no part of Levitical service carried on today, that should be apart from priestly oversight.<a name=160:6></a> Those of us who can go back in history some twenty years, to the time when there was a period of great trial and distress amongst the people of God, will recall that this was one of the great issues of that moment -- as to whether what was evangelical and Levitical, that is what has man in view, should be exercised in independence of what is priestly.<a name=160:7></a> All Levitical service, no matter how small it is, is to be under priestly oversight.<a name=160:8></a> Now, you may say, does that mean that another brother, a priestly brother, is to stand by and take note of all that I do, and tell me whether it is wrong?<a name=160:9></a> I do not think it quite means that.<a name=160:10></a> You see in christianity you find the priest and the Levite in the same person, and the meaning of it is just this, that whenever you stretch out your hand manward, you are exercised to remember as a priest, what is due to God.<a name=160:11></a> It is the priestly instinct in oneself, the priestly eye, that would exercise the oversight of all service that has man's blessing in view.<a name=160:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I am sure that is very important, because the priest's instinct will exercise restraint.<a name=160:13></a> It will keep you from going to many a place, and putting your hand to
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=161>[Page 161]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		many a thing.<a name=161:1></a> There are many opportunities of Levitical service in the world today that you cannot use, because the priestly sensibilities in your soul give you the sense that it is not according to God, and you recognise that.<a name=161:2></a> Thus priestly instinct and priestly discernment should govern every Levite in his activities in service.<a name=161:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are three branches of Levites -- the family of Gershon, of Kohath, and of Merari.<a name=161:4></a> I want you to note, dear brethren, the positions of these three families of Levites in relation to the tabernacle.<a name=161:5></a> Moses and Aaron and his sons occupied the eastward position -- the position of the sun rising.<a name=161:6></a> The family of Gershon was behind the tabernacle westward -- the position of the sun's setting.<a name=161:7></a> The family of Kohath occupied the southern position, a most favourable one, which I will speak of again.<a name=161:8></a> Then the family of Merari encamped on the side of the tabernacle northward.<a name=161:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The name Gershon means 'A stranger here'.<a name=161:10></a> The name Kohath means 'Assembly', and Merari means 'Bitter, or Excited'.<a name=161:11></a> These are the meanings of the names, which you can verify.<a name=161:12></a> How peculiarly beautiful is the divine setting in which these three families are placed by the divine ordering.<a name=161:13></a> You see, Moses and Aaron, who stand for all the dignity and majesty in which the divine system was ushered in -- the apostle and the high priest -- they are at the sun rising.<a name=161:14></a> If you bring it down to assembly conditions, I believe that it corresponds to the day of Pentecost.<a name=161:15></a> It was a glorious position; there had never been a moment like it on earth.<a name=161:16></a> There had never been a time of such liberty for divine Persons as on that day when, with Christ in heaven and all His work accomplished, the Spirit

	<div class="paragraph">
		came down, as the great witness of His triumph to form that peculiar structure that was to be the dwelling-place of God.<a name=162:1></a> Scripture speaks of the sun rising in his majesty and strength, and the day of Pentecost was marked by majesty and strength.<a name=162:2></a> It was the ushering in of the system.<a name=162:3></a> There was no evidence of weakness; men were afraid to join themselves to the assembly.<a name=162:4></a> When evil was manifested, as it was in the case of Ananias and Sapphira, the thing was immediately exposed and judged.<a name=162:5></a> There was no opportunity, or liberty, for the enemy to work at that moment.<a name=162:6></a> It was the hour of the sun rising.<a name=162:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But behind the tabernacle is the family of Gershon.<a name=162:8></a> They are marked by strangership, pilgrimship, and their position is the sun setting.<a name=162:9></a> How different is the moment of the sun rising, from the moment of the sun setting!<a name=162:10></a> How comely that those who are behind the tabernacle, who see the sun go down in its course, should be found as strangers.<a name=162:11></a> The sun-setting position, as developed in 2 Timothy, with the obligation to separate from what is unholy, and the recognition of the assembly as a heavenly vessel, is treasured in the heart of the family of Gershon, and they are found on earth as strangers.<a name=162:12></a> Kohath, on the other hand, is situated on the south, and is in the position where the sun is shining, and where all its warmth and influence are felt.<a name=162:13></a> It corresponds to assembly conditions, for in these the sun, so to speak, is always shining.<a name=162:14></a> In the assembly, God has secured His own blessed thoughts, and the sun always shines there.<a name=162:15></a> It is the most favourable position, and it is protected from the north winds.<a name=162:16></a> The family of the Kohathites pitched on that side.<a name=162:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=163>[Page 163]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But in the north you have the family of Merari -- the name meaning 'bitter or excited'.<a name=163:1></a> What is so calculated, according to divine thoughts, to subdue what is bitter and what is prone to excitement as the north position?<a name=163:2></a> The cold winds come out of the north -- God's discipline, the pressure of the pathway, the sorrows connected with it, all those painful exercises connected with the breaking down of the flesh in us, and with learning the bitterness of one's own heart as a man.<a name=163:3></a> Merari is placed in the north.<a name=163:4></a> With what skill and wisdom God has placed His people!<a name=163:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to call attention to the distinctive impressions which each of these families has gathered typically about Christ, and this is really what is on my mind.<a name=163:6></a> The power of being able to 'carry' things, as these three families did, is the evidence that you have learned to love them, that you have appreciated them, and that you know, as divinely taught, what they are.<a name=163:7></a> In the world things can be carried, of which the one who carries has no consciousness, no knowledge, no movement of heart, no regard for; but when you come to the things of God, you can only carry what you love and what you value.<a name=163:8></a> It is very significant that when the ark was brought up to Jerusalem by David, the peculiar attack which the enemy made at that moment was directed wholly against the Levitical element.<a name=163:9></a> Satan's attack was the introduction of a cart -- a new cart -- and the cart always displaces the Levite.<a name=163:10></a> The Levite's place was to carry, and you can only carry in wilderness conditions, those appreciations of Christ that you have taken into your heart.<a name=163:11></a> So each of these families of Levites, according to the peculiar position that
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=164>[Page 164]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		they had in relation to the tabernacle, had learned in their souls to love certain features of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=164:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The family of the Gershonites who, as the name signifies, were 'strangers', and who were behind the tabernacle westward, carried what one might describe as the soft materials.<a name=164:2></a> They carried the tabernacle -- its tent, and its coverings, the hangings too of the court, and the cords.<a name=164:3></a> This was their burden.<a name=164:4></a> The Kohathites, who were in the southward position, that is, in the light of the revelation of God in Christ in assembly conditions, carried the most intimate and precious things that were found in the tabernacle -- the ark, the table, the candlestick, and the altars.<a name=164:5></a> They carried too all the vessels of the sanctuary.<a name=164:6></a> Then the family of Merari, who had passed through all the experiences which are typical of learning the evil of our own hearts, carried the hard materials of the tabernacle -- the boards of acacia wood, the bars, the pillars, the bases, the pegs, and the cords.<a name=164:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now what I want to try and develop is just this, that the peculiar discipline and exercise which is suggested in the positions of these families, is what qualifies them to appreciate Christ, in the particular features which they were to sustain and bear in the wilderness.<a name=164:8></a> It is very beautiful.<a name=164:9></a> The Gershonites carried, as I said, all the soft materials.<a name=164:10></a> You will remember how the tabernacle was constructed.<a name=164:11></a> The outer covering was of badgers' skins.<a name=164:12></a> That speaks of what was seen in its perfection in Christ, which is to be formed by the Spirit in the saints, that is vigilance, the power of detecting the working of evil, and involving the power to cover and protect the precious, holy things that are underneath.<a name=164:13></a> Beneath the badgers' skins was
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=165>[Page 165]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		a covering of rams' skins dyed red.<a name=165:1></a> How that speaks of the devotedness of Christ!<a name=165:2></a> The ram was the consecration offering; it speaks of His consecration, of how He was wholly given over to the will of God, and of the path that He had to tread to effectuate the will of God.<a name=165:3></a> He had to go the way of death.<a name=165:4></a> So this covering, which spoke of His devotion, is to be marked by that which speaks of death; they have to be dyed red.<a name=165:5></a> Then underneath this covering is what is called the tent over the tabernacle; it was made of goats' skins.<a name=165:6></a> How that speaks of the absolute separation of Christ from all evil!<a name=165:7></a> How it speaks of the lonely paths in which His feet had to tread in pursuance of the will of God!<a name=165:8></a> It speaks too of those features to be reproduced in the saints.<a name=165:9></a> Every one of the family of Gershon is to have these features reproduced in him, so that he can carry them, bear them in the wilderness.<a name=165:10></a> And then underneath the covering of goats' skins are the boards of the tabernacle, and they are linked with the family of Merari.<a name=165:11></a> But hanging over the boards -- those boards covered with gold -- and forming the ceiling within, are all the beautiful embroidered curtains of the tabernacle; blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined byssus.<a name=165:12></a> How they speak of the four-fold glories that centre in the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=165:13></a> The fine linen, or the byssus as it is rendered, that fine weave, speaks of the uniformity of His life, every day's service to God so dovetailed in with every other day.<a name=165:14></a> Every word fitted perfectly with every day; there was no disparity, no gaps, it was all the fine weaving, the texture of a life of absolute uniformity under the eye of God.<a name=165:15></a> The Spirit of God would work these features in the heart of every Gershonite, for how can he appreciate them and carry them unless he has

		them in his affections?<a name=166:1></a> And then the blue, I suppose, refers to what is heavenly.<a name=166:2></a> It is the heavenly character of the Son of man.<a name=166:3></a> The purple refers to the royal dignity and glory of Christ, and the scarlet to the earthly dignity and titles, that He will take up as the Heir of all things here on this earth.<a name=166:4></a> These are all typified in the beautiful curtains of byssus, and they were embroidered.<a name=166:5></a> How one loves to think of the embroidery work!<a name=166:6></a> How the Spirit delights to show to our discerning hearts these beautiful traces of divine perfection, seen in that blessed One as Man.<a name=166:7></a> The more you look into them the more glorious and beautiful they are.<a name=166:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Gershonite would love these things.<a name=166:9></a> He loves them at the sun setting too, not merely in the day when as at the beginning they were marked by power and glory, but he loves them at the end of the day.<a name=166:10></a> How near we have drawn to the close of the day!<a name=166:11></a> How near we are to the sunset of this day!<a name=166:12></a> I wonder if we are true sons of Gershon, bearing these distinctive and peculiar features of Christ, as having apprehended them in Him, and thus portraying to men what is heavenly, what they cannot understand.<a name=166:13></a> These are the marks of the Gershonites.<a name=166:14></a> Can you not see that their position gives them their exercise?<a name=166:15></a> They are strangers, and strangership is the exercise that is necessary, to learn to treasure these beautiful features of Christ.<a name=166:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, let me turn to the family of Merari for a moment, to show how these things dovetail in.<a name=166:17></a> As we saw, their position is a northward one.<a name=166:18></a> They are in the place where the weakness and vileness of the flesh are made known, and what does the Spirit of God minister to them?<a name=166:19></a> What peculiar features of Christ has He brought to bear upon them to strengthen them in that position?<a name=166:20></a> The boards

		of the tabernacle.<a name=167:1></a> Do you know what these boards were made of?<a name=167:2></a> They were made of what is called incorruptible wood.<a name=167:3></a> I believe the epistle to the Romans answers to this.<a name=167:4></a> A man is set up to support something.<a name=167:5></a> The boards are the features which give stability and support to all the soft materials that were carried by the Gershonites; they speak of the precious humanity of Christ.<a name=167:6></a> It was incorruptible humanity.<a name=167:7></a> There was not an element there that Satan could work upon.<a name=167:8></a> They speak of His endurance.<a name=167:9></a> Oh, how we need endurance in the northward position, when the cold winds blow, and they are cold!<a name=167:10></a> We need to learn endurance as we pass through life here, with its pressure and its sorrow, and as we move from one kind of pressure to another we need the endurance that was seen in Christ.<a name=167:11></a> Then these boards, which in themselves do not betray what is beautiful, and glorious, are covered with gold.<a name=167:12></a> The board is beneath, the exterior is the gold, the pure gold -- divine righteousness, indicating how Christ as a Man here maintained everything that was due to God.<a name=167:13></a> He maintained it, He never weakened it, to reach men.<a name=167:14></a> He was never diverted from the path of absolutely maintaining the righteousness of God.<a name=167:15></a> Now the epistle to the Romans gives us the peculiar light that shows how a man can stand upon his feet before God and before men.<a name=167:16></a> Delivered from the bondage of sin, from the power of lust and evil, set apart for God, so that his body can be yielded to God as a living sacrifice.<a name=167:17></a> A true son of Merari would appreciate all this, and as he appreciates it, he would be able to carry it.<a name=167:18></a> When he carried it in its journey through the wilderness, he would have in his soul the precious sense of what the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the family of the Kohathites had a peculiarly blessed path and service.<a name=168:2></a> It was so blessed that Jehovah told Moses that he was not to cut them off from among the Levites.<a name=168:3></a> A Kohathite was distinguished amongst all the sons of Levi, in that he was permitted to carry the ark, and the table, and the candlestick, and all the holy vessels of the tabernacle.<a name=168:4></a> In doing this service they were preserved by what was priestly in Aaron and his sons (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#4:17">Numbers  4:17</a> - 20).<a name=168:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in speaking of the ark as connected with the wilderness, I think you will find that it is called the "ark of the testimony".<a name=168:6></a> The ark is given different designations in Scripture, which indicate special features that are in view where it is spoken of.<a name=168:7></a> There are two great thoughts which centre around the tabernacle; one is that it was the place where God dwelt, and the other thought is testimony.<a name=168:8></a> So here it is Christ -- perhaps the most precious type of Christ that there is -- as the blessed vessel of the testimony.<a name=168:9></a> God would maintain the testimony in the wilderness.<a name=168:10></a> When the ark is taken over into the land, this expression -- the ark of the testimony -- ceases.<a name=168:11></a> It is spoken of otherwise, such as ark of Jehovah, ark of God, etc.<a name=168:12></a> But as long as it is in the wilderness, it is the ark of the testimony.<a name=168:13></a> It was placed in the most holy place, so no Levite could look on it, no stranger could draw near.<a name=168:14></a> The order of the moving of the tabernacle was this, that the priest had to go within and cover up the holy furniture, and when they were put into the hands of the Levites every piece of furniture, except one, bore the external covering of the badgers' skins.<a name=168:15></a> Men do not know what we are carrying; they may reckon that

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When, however, they covered the ark of testimony, they put over it first the veil then the badgers' skins, then the cloth wholly of blue.<a name=169:10></a> It was the only piece of furniture that came out of the tabernacle that had any external evidence of heavenly beauty; it had the cloth of blue.<a name=169:11></a> What a beautiful picture all this is, typical of the product of the Spirit of God working in their hearts, carrying all these distinctive features of Christ through the wilderness, and everybody could see the cloth of blue.<a name=169:12></a> It speaks of what Christ is in His own blessed Person.<a name=169:13></a> It pleased Him to come into manhood for the will of God, and coming into manhood He made that position glorious.<a name=169:14></a> He made the acacia wood glorious, He made it distinctive, He made it shine out in all the glories of a Man who was here wholly for God, prepared to endure to the end.<a name=169:15></a> The cloth of blue speaks of the distinctive glory of the blessed Person, who was God, who came into manhood, and in manhood bore witness to all that was heavenly.<a name=169:16></a> The Person, whose garments are thus typified in the coverings of the ark, though in the lowly condition of a Man, yet He was the Son of God.<a name=169:17></a> This cloth of blue distinguished the ark with the outward evidence of what was heavenly.<a name=169:18></a>

		Well, we might linger, dear brethren, we might well linger over such beautiful figures of Christ, but the time has gone.<a name=170:1></a> It was not on my mind to suggest more than this, that these three families of the Levites, in their respective settings, would learn to appreciate certain features of Christ, and now as the thing works out in regard of ourselves, we have to learn to be of the family of Kohath, of the family of Gershon, and of the family of Merari.<a name=170:2></a> We have to learn them all.<a name=170:3></a> God would produce, by His work in us, appreciation of Christ in all these beautiful aspects.<a name=170:4></a> If you are suffering at the moment from the north wind, if you are finding the exercise of enduring a difficult one, you can obtain grace and comfort and encouragement from the One who endured to the end.<a name=170:5></a> You can gather into your own heart these appreciations of Christ which the Spirit of God would use to form the very same features in you, so that you will endure to the end.<a name=170:6></a> And if you have found your place amongst the brethren, that is Kohath; he found the brethren, he is an assembly man, he knows all the precious features of the assembly that have to be carried in wilderness conditions.<a name=170:7></a> No matter what history outside is recording, these privileges always are available.<a name=170:8></a> God has never changed assembly conditions from the day of Pentecost until now.<a name=170:9></a> They run on, they are based on great divine principles which speak of what God is, they are based on His love, and that is unalterable; it is the southern position with your brethren.<a name=170:10></a> All the warmth and influences of the sunshine of the day are found in the south, and as you walk through this scene, this wilderness scene, you are in the consciousness that you are a stranger, and a pilgrim, that you are in the last days, and that the sun is setting.<a name=170:11></a> But

		I desire to speak in a simple way about shepherding, particularly in view of the way things are to be carried on among the Lord's people.<a name=173:1></a> I notice with Peter and Paul, and indeed with every true man of God, not only are they exercised as to how things are to be maintained in their own day, but they have deep concern as to how they are to be continued after they have gone.<a name=173:2></a>

		One of the marks of a man of God is that his vision embraces the whole thought of divine purpose.<a name=173:3></a> Things may be of very great interest to us in our local meeting, where we are more or less familiar with the exercises of brethren, and with the matters worked out there under God's good hand.<a name=173:4></a> But a true man of God is privileged to look beyond the confines of what is local, and to reach out in his vision to the whole circle of the interests of Christ on earth.<a name=173:5></a> You say, That is a very embracing view, and it is, but that is not all, for the man of God is not only privileged to embrace every feature of the interests of Christ upon the earth, but he can look into heaven.<a name=173:6></a> He can look back, and he can look forward.<a name=173:7></a> In other words, the whole sphere of divine operations from the beginning, right on to the end, is brought within his compass.<a name=173:8></a> One great mark of a true lover of Christ, as has been remarked, is that he is just as much concerned about the welfare of the Lord's people in a future day as in his own day.<a name=173:9></a>

		I introduce that in connection with the thought of shepherding, because I notice the Lord and His apostles put great emphasis upon the shepherding of the sheep, as indicating that that activity would guard the flock in the grievous day that they saw approaching.<a name=174:1></a> One of the last things that John's gospel records as to the Lord, is that He gives to Peter the commission to shepherd His sheep, showing it was a matter of the deepest importance in the mind of the Lord.<a name=174:2></a> In fact, the giving of this commission to Peter at the close, suggests that it requires moral history, and qualifications, if one is to be entrusted with such a privileged service.<a name=174:3></a> You will recall what Paul says in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20:28">Acts  20:28</a>, on the occasion of leaving the place where his crowning work for Christ was done, "Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, wherein the Holy Spirit has set you as overseers".<a name=174:4></a> His concern was that there should be those who would shepherd the flock in view of the day that was coming, when wolves would come in from without, and false teachers arise from within.<a name=174:5></a> I mention this in view of showing the importance the Lord attaches to shepherd care, trusting that it may tend to promote it among us.<a name=174:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is noteworthy that the apostles do not commit the care of the flock to 'gift', if you understand what I mean.<a name=174:7></a> There would be ministry, surely, the Lord would see to that, but the thought is that the sheep are to be cared for by those who have a shepherd spirit, and who would take up the charge from the very same motives as governed the Lord Himself.<a name=174:8></a> If we refer to the two titles, "good shepherd", and "chief shepherd", for a moment, the distinction between them is this: in relation to the former,

		the Lord is alone -- absolutely alone.<a name=175:1></a> As the good Shepherd, He stands in contrast to all others who assumed the place of shepherds, as He says, "All whoever came before me are thieves and robbers".<a name=175:2></a> As the good Shepherd He stands out alone in contrast to such.<a name=175:3></a> But when the title "chief shepherd" is used, others are in view, and I am sure every one who loves Christ would desire to take up in their measure shepherd care for one another, as they have learned it from Him.<a name=175:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we look at <a href="../bible/John.htm#10">John  10</a>for a moment, we find three features connected with the Lord as the good Shepherd.<a name=175:5></a> First, He lays down His life for the sheep; secondly, He knows all those that are His; and thirdly, all those that are His know Him.<a name=175:6></a> The great basis of intimacy between the Lord and His people is connected with the laying down of His life.<a name=175:7></a> It forms a bond of marvellous intimacy between the Lord and His people.<a name=175:8></a> What wonderful reciprocity of affection is suggested in these words, "I know those that are mine, and am known of those that are mine, as the Father knows me and I know the Father".<a name=175:9></a> The laying down of His life is the basis of all; and if you want to be a shepherd, the first essential feature is that you are prepared to lay down your life for the brethren.<a name=175:10></a> It will cost you your life, be assured of that!<a name=175:11></a> If you take up shepherd care among the people of God, you can only take it up on the principle of laying down your life.<a name=175:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But see what it will promote!<a name=175:13></a> It will give you access to hearts, just as the Lord in the actual laying down of His life has reached ours.<a name=175:14></a> What opened the door of our hearts to Him?<a name=175:15></a> What led us to say, Come in and take possession?<a name=175:16></a> The powerful influence of His love, expressed in the

	<div class="paragraph">
		If we think of the term 'sheep', it presents the people of God in that aspect which calls forth compassion and consideration.<a name=176:3></a> You may think of the highest privilege of christianity -- sonship -- and you may find a few with whom you can converse on this theme, but the great fact stares you in the face that the mass of the Lord's people knows nothing of that.<a name=176:4></a> I do not mean that sonship is not theirs, for it belongs to every saint, but for the moment what is before me is entrance into it spiritually.<a name=176:5></a> You may speak in the same way of what is priestly, the service of God, and how it is carried on by the maintenance of what God has brought into function.<a name=176:6></a> But the great fact remains that the majority of the people of God knows nothing of priestly service.<a name=176:7></a> But when you think of the sheep, you have no small select company in mind.<a name=176:8></a> <i>All</i> the Lord's people come into mind practically -- every one; and, as viewed in that character they call forth compassion and consideration.<a name=176:9></a> The mass have little ability to gather food out of the Scriptures; they are just sheep, and sheep have to be led to their food, to the green grass that grows beside still waters.<a name=176:10></a> And not only do they require to be led to their food, but they require those quiet conditions -- still waters -- before they will feed at all!<a name=176:11></a> The term 'sheep', thus suggests the people of God in their helplessness, open to attacks from wolves, thieves and robbers.<a name=176:12></a> These will prey on them, and they are unresisting.<a name=176:13></a> The consideration of

		I read <a href="../bible/John.htm#21">John  21</a>in order that we might take account of the exercises of one to whom the Lord committed the feeding of His lambs, and the shepherding of His sheep.<a name=177:2></a> It is very remarkable (I have often pondered it) that they should be committed to the hand of Peter, as he had a very heavy hand.<a name=177:3></a> Yet there was no diplomacy about Peter; he was impulsive, a man who was marked by speaking first, and thinking afterwards.<a name=177:4></a> But there was nothing concealed; all that was in came out.<a name=177:5></a> It is to <i>this</i> man that the Lord commits His sheep.<a name=177:6></a> I would not suggest for a moment that these natural traits that marked Peter gave him any qualification to shepherd the sheep, for there is nothing in nature that qualifies for that service.<a name=177:7></a> Great wealth, mental power, business ability to conduct and organise affairs will not give you the slightest qualification to shepherd the sheep.<a name=177:8></a> All that one would rely on after the flesh must be broken, and natural ability as a qualification set aside, before the Lord can commit the least of His flock to us.<a name=177:9></a> He makes no mistake in His selection; He does not commit the most precious thing He has on earth, to those who are half-hearted, but to those who are characterised by deep affection.<a name=177:10></a> Such was Simon Peter, he was outstanding among the disciples in his love for Christ.<a name=177:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How graciously, and yet how wisely the Lord tested Peter!<a name=178:12></a> He is a formed vessel now, the product of divine teaching, and he will not trust himself to say anything at all about himself without adding that word, Thou knowest that I am attached to Thee.<a name=178:13></a> It is well to be careful when we speak about our love for Christ, not that we would deny that affection is there, for every lover of Christ would readily answer when the question is raised, Do you love Christ?<a name=178:14></a> But when we speak of the <i>measure</i> we have to be careful.<a name=178:15></a>

		So Peter, with all his blunders, with all his impetuosity, has the sheep entrusted to him.<a name=179:1></a> It is interesting to take account of the movements of divine sovereignty, but you will observe they do not travel ahead of the work of the Spirit.<a name=179:2></a> There was a time in Peter's history, when he placed himself in the very centre of the picture, so to speak, and said to the Lord, "Lord, with thee I am ready to go both to prison and to death" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22:33">Luke  22:33</a>).<a name=179:3></a> The Lord did not say anything <i>then</i> to him about feeding His sheep, not a word, yet as acting in sovereignty He knew all about what He would do with Peter.<a name=179:4></a> But the manifestation of the movement of sovereignty awaits the formation of the vessel, and when Peter is prepared to serve the sheep, the Lord commits them to him.<a name=179:5></a> Are you seeking some area or sphere of service?<a name=179:6></a> Be assured, when your affections are formed for it, the Lord will give it you.<a name=179:7></a> For all His movements in sovereignty among the saints, have perfect relation to the measure in which the vessel is formed, the measure in which the flesh and will are broken down, and subdued by the power of God.<a name=179:8></a>

		the full and perfect expression of all that could ever be known of Him.<a name=187:1></a> Now if God comes down, as presented in John's gospel, He comes down with marvellous evidences of His greatness: not indeed, with external evidences of greatness, sufficiently manifest for the world to receive Christ or know Him, for "the world knew him not", and "his own received him not".<a name=187:2></a> But there <i>were</i> certain marvellous evidences of greatness connected with that Person which it is essential we should understand.<a name=187:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first is that "in the beginning" He "was".<a name=187:4></a> Every creature must have a beginning for his thoughts, and a conclusion.<a name=187:5></a> We have no power to carry in our minds the thought of things that have no beginning, and no end.<a name=187:6></a> Men of the world love to trace things back; archaeologists and suchlike persons pride themselves on being able by a few scanty evidences here and there, to trace a thing back to its source.<a name=187:7></a> But you notice that whether they talk in millions or billions of years, it is always in units of time.<a name=187:8></a> Now here is One who, before there was any time, "in the beginning", "was".<a name=187:9></a> "The beginning", was not His beginning.<a name=187:10></a> Everything else had a beginning.<a name=187:11></a> He had no beginning: He "was".<a name=187:12></a> He comes before us in His marvellous greatness as the One who "was".<a name=187:13></a> He is the "I am", to use another title.<a name=187:14></a> But here the thought we are to lay hold of is that there is a beginning of all things, but that there is no beginning as to God.<a name=187:15></a> "In the beginning was the Word .<a name=187:16></a>.<a name=187:17></a>.<a name=187:18></a> and the Word was God".<a name=187:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, I call your attention to the fact that "All things received being through him, and without him not one thing received being which has received being".<a name=187:20></a> The Lord is before us as the great Giver of all "being".<a name=187:21></a> Whatever

		scientists may say, whatever may be thought in the world, there is nothing that has being, but has received it from the Lord.<a name=188:1></a> It has all passed through His hands, so to speak; it exists because of Him.<a name=188:2></a> God lives of Himself.<a name=188:3></a> He can live in eternity, He inhabits eternity (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#57:15">Isaiah  57:15</a>); He is dependent upon no one.<a name=188:4></a> But everything that has received being has received it from Christ.<a name=188:5></a> So that He comes before us as the great and glorious Originator of everything that has being.<a name=188:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now to pursue further, we read, "In him was life, and the life was the light of men".<a name=188:7></a> The statement "In him was life", brings out another feature of divine greatness.<a name=188:8></a> We have no explanation.<a name=188:9></a> Our life is dependent on God, "who preserves all things in life" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#6:13">1 Timothy  6:13</a>), but of this Person it is said that, "In him was life".<a name=188:10></a> It is a feature of divine greatness, and having man's apprehension in view, it says "and the life was the light of men".<a name=188:11></a> When men are in view, you get the idea of "light".<a name=188:12></a> So that His divine greatness and these precious features of it, which produce adoration and worship in our souls, come before us in the way of light.<a name=188:13></a> Light was here in Jesus.<a name=188:14></a> Not indeed physical light, as with the sun.<a name=188:15></a> For the sun rose and set and followed its ordinary course in the ordering of God while He was here as before.<a name=188:16></a> But light which was the outshining of that life which was in Him, shone in a marvellous way to enlighten every man.<a name=188:17></a> Whatever problems there were in the world, whatever there was of darkness and distance, light was here in Jesus.<a name=188:18></a> It shone out in Jesus, and was the expression of His life, for "In him was life, and the life was the light of men".<a name=188:19></a> John the baptist draws attention to this light; it is a great thing to draw man's attention to the

		light of God.<a name=189:1></a> You can talk to a believer, one that has the Spirit, about the features of divine greatness that attach to Christ.<a name=189:2></a> But if you want to talk to men, you must draw attention to the light.<a name=189:3></a> John was a witness to the light, and he speaks about that light as shining for all men, having all men in view.<a name=189:4></a> God came before men in this sovereign way as light, and that light was presented in Christ.<a name=189:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the light was refused in two ways: "He was in the world, and the world had its being through him, and the world knew him not".<a name=189:6></a> That is, the world had no knowledge, nor understanding of the light that shone.<a name=189:7></a> Then it says "He came to his own, and his own received him not".<a name=189:8></a> It is important for us all, and especially for young people, to understand that light is not known, nor understood, nor received, without a sovereign work of God in the soul.<a name=189:9></a> In the ordinary sense, nothing is so apparent as light.<a name=189:10></a> If you come into a dark room, and the lights are switched on, it would not matter what you were looking at, floor, or ceiling, or persons, you would be conscious at once of light.<a name=189:11></a> But the Lord Jesus came here, the One who made the world.<a name=189:12></a> Surely the world He made will perceive and understand!<a name=189:13></a> The world was full of wisdom of its own in that day, full of learning, full of enquiry: but strange to say, this glorious Person with all the light that radiated from Him, passed through the world unknown, or refused by the world!<a name=189:14></a> God has expressed Himself before men, and that expression is perfect and full, and marked by the dignity that attaches to a divine Person.<a name=189:15></a> But when Christ came He was not known in the world, and was refused by those who should have recognised Him.<a name=189:16></a> We learn, however, from verses 12 and 13 that to "as many as

		We have these two thoughts, the world that "knew him not", with all its wisdom and attainment; and the Jew, the carefully cultured man, "received him not".<a name=190:14></a> But then you get a sovereign movement that is absolutely of God, the <i>will of God</i> asserts itself.<a name=190:15></a> God can always come in at a crisis and call attention to His will.<a name=190:16></a> When a thing is <i>not</i>, He can say, 'I will', and it <i>is</i>.<a name=190:17></a> There is no one like God!<a name=190:18></a> In a crisis like this, when there is complete refusal of, or ignorance as to, all that God would present to men, He can meet it by His will; He can meet every crisis by His will.<a name=190:19></a> If you study this gospel, you will find that the ministry connected with John (and the presentation of the divine system in it) is connected with the will of God, not with faithfulness on the part of men.<a name=190:20></a> John's gospel comes in after Laodicean conditions have been fully developed.<a name=190:21></a> He

		Our understanding of the truth largely depends on our apprehension of the movements of divine Persons.<a name=197:1></a> The coming down from heaven of the Lord Jesus, His going into death, His rising from the dead, and His going back to heaven, complete a cycle of divine movements which are detailed in the Scripture, along with certain features of the truth connected with them.<a name=197:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first movement before us is in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>, where we read "the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us".<a name=197:3></a> Here we have presented a condition which is visible, in contrast to one which is invisible, for "No one has seen God at any time" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:18">John  1:18</a>).<a name=197:4></a> Indeed, we are told that no one can see God.<a name=197:5></a> But a divine Person could take another form, in which He becomes visible to men, and that is what is conveyed in the statement, "the Word became flesh".<a name=197:6></a> He became something which was not true of Him before; this involved a movement on His part.<a name=197:7></a> When He became flesh, it was His own act, an act that clearly indicated God's desire to be known.<a name=197:8></a> God is so great that there was no possibility of any creature reaching up to Him in the conditions of Deity, He dwells in light unapproachable.<a name=197:9></a> No one could make a movement towards God in that sense; God must make the movement if He is to be known.<a name=197:10></a> If He is to be seen by men, or men are to be filled with what God

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Word became flesh and the apostle says, "we have contemplated his glory".<a name=198:2></a> It was a glorious matter to him, a matter to fill the soul!<a name=198:3></a> It was not a cold doctrine or statement of belief; but something that filled his soul with the sense of glory.<a name=198:4></a> As we apprehend that a divine Person has taken a form that brings Him within our range, all His movements are full of importance and meaning to us.<a name=198:5></a> As understanding these movements, we move towards that blessed Person, and learn in the power of the Spirit, what they mean.<a name=198:6></a> There is nothing else within our view, that is of such magnitude, and so attractive.<a name=198:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This movement of the Lord in the first chapter of John is at once seen as holding men, attracting them, so that they become contemplators of His glory.<a name=198:8></a> Then it gives the character of the glory -- "as of an only-begotten with a father", as having especially in view His relation with the Father.<a name=198:9></a> How delightful He was to the Father!<a name=198:10></a> There is nothing more blessed to contemplate than an only-begotten with a father, when that only-begotten is Christ with His Father.<a name=198:11></a>

		Finally, in chapter 16: 27, the Lord says, "for the Father himself has affection for you, because ye have had affection for me, and have believed that I came out from God".<a name=204:3></a> The Lord at this point is encouraging the disciples to have to do with the Father Himself.<a name=204:4></a> While we understand that the Father is only known in the Son, yet the disciples having become lovers of Christ, find their own position now assured as before the Father Himself.<a name=204:5></a> He is inviting them to speak to the Father: "the Father himself has affection for you, because ye have had affection for me, and have believed that I came out from God".<a name=204:6></a> The Lord as coming out from the Father, and sent forth from the Father, and now going back to the Father states that the result of these movements is that we have access to the Father Himself, and know that the Father Himself loves us, because we have loved Christ.<a name=204:7></a> It is a kind of climax.<a name=204:8></a> What I want to emphasise is the expression "the Father himself".<a name=204:9></a> It is very personal.<a name=204:10></a> One notices the lack in our worship of that which is connected with the Father Himself.<a name=204:11></a> The Father indeed delights to hear us speaking to Him about the Son.<a name=204:12></a> But then there is the Father <i>Himself</i>, He is to have a personal place in our hearts, and in our worship and thanksgiving.<a name=204:13></a> The Father is to be not merely a name to us, but One known personally.<a name=204:14></a> So the Lord says, "the Father himself has affection for you".<a name=204:15></a> What can one say of the Father Himself?<a name=204:16></a> He loves to hear of Christ, and one is deeply thankful for any measure

		Now the Lord's answer is full of instruction, telling us in effect, that John was reserved.<a name=208:8></a> He was reserved for something that was outside of, and beyond, Peter's commission and Peter's work, and that something, whatever it was, wholly depended upon the will of the Lord.<a name=208:9></a> I need hardly say that when you get such an expression as, 'the will of the Lord', or 'the will of God', you have what is absolute.<a name=208:10></a> It gives you a great sense of stability and permanency.<a name=208:11></a> There could be nothing greater for us than to know the will of the Lord; it is final.<a name=208:12></a> There is no argument, no reasoning, no questioning, there it stands.<a name=208:13></a> And so Peter learns that, while the great sphere of public service is very much in the heart of the Lord Jesus, yet He is keeping John for something in reserve for Himself, something connected with His own will, that would come to light as He was pleased to reveal it.<a name=208:14></a> John speaks of himself as "the disciple whom Jesus loved", and you will not fail to see that what is for the Lord's own heart, what is connected with His love -- not exactly with His care, is to be reserved for the last day.<a name=208:15></a>

		I begin my references in this gospel with <a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>, and suggest that John the evangelist was one of the two who followed Jesus.<a name=211:3></a> When you get an unnamed person in this gospel doing something that is to be commended, we are justified in assuming that that person is John.<a name=211:4></a> He tells us who the other one was.<a name=211:5></a> Oh, what a lovely spirit!<a name=211:6></a> One often listens to the brethren giving an account of something and alas, how much of the big 'I' there is at times!<a name=211:7></a> But John brings in this delightful feature, that he would always narrate the best as to the brethren, and would attract attention to someone else.<a name=211:8></a> How loveable is that feature!<a name=211:9></a> The measure of love with us is largely shown by the extent to which we put ourselves in the background, or bring others forward.<a name=211:10></a> Love will always search out what is in the background.<a name=211:11></a> What is there behind the public position?<a name=211:12></a> What is there behind the gospel?<a name=211:13></a> What is there behind a good Bible reading?<a name=211:14></a> What is behind it is the loveable company.<a name=211:15></a> The saints who are content to be amongst the brethren as disciples whom Jesus loved -- these are the people that give stamina, and moral support to every occasion.<a name=211:16></a> These who would glory, first of all, in the fact that Jesus loves them.<a name=211:17></a> Oh, what a challenge it is to us!<a name=211:18></a> If we were sitting down, and taking stock of what we possess spiritually, where would we put the love of Christ?<a name=211:19></a> You may say, I know this or that doctrine.<a name=211:20></a> I have a library of books, and I preach every Sunday night, and I have

		gathered so many converts.<a name=212:1></a> But if you were asking John to give you an account of his spiritual possessions, he would begin, I am sure, with the fact that he was a disciple whom Jesus loved.<a name=212:2></a> In such an account he is not excluding others.<a name=212:3></a> John would not exclude any one.<a name=212:4></a> He is very near to the heart of Christ, but he would always leave room for others, for he is one of the many loved by Christ: that is his distinction.<a name=212:5></a>

		In chapter 13 you will notice that Peter has the most to say in the first part.<a name=212:6></a> He makes himself prominent at a time when prominence is a shame.<a name=212:7></a> There are times, you know, dear brethren, when we are together and the Lord Himself is filling out the moment with His service.<a name=212:8></a> At such a time it is a shame for us to make ourselves prominent.<a name=212:9></a> Perhaps Peter thought he was doing very well, honouring Christ by his words; but Peter was really hindering the service of Christ.<a name=212:10></a> The normal service of the moment had to be interrupted, in order that Peter should be put right.<a name=212:11></a> The Lord is very gracious -- much more gracious than we are with one another.<a name=212:12></a> The Lord tarried to put Peter right, to teach him.<a name=212:13></a> Adjustment in this inside circle is by teaching.<a name=212:14></a> But now Peter, having been put right, is not prominent, and you will notice that he made a sign to John.<a name=212:15></a> Just think of Peter, so notable for readiness of speech, making a sign to John.<a name=212:16></a> An occasion like this was one for speaking of the most sensitive kind, and so Peter appeals to John.<a name=212:17></a> Peter was not near enough to the Lord, so he turns to the disciple who was in the bosom of Jesus.<a name=212:18></a>

		Now I call your attention to the thought of witness in verse 35.<a name=214:14></a> It says "there came out blood and water".<a name=214:15></a> And then John says, speaking in an impersonal way, "and he who saw it bears witness".<a name=214:16></a> This feature of the truth, connected with the blood and the water, is the point where christendom, or public profession, turns to the one side, and those who know the love of Jesus in its holy intimacy, turn to the other; they part company here.<a name=214:17></a> No feature of

		The movements of the Lord Jesus are full of interest; they are marked by an import and meaning which cannot be overestimated or overemphasised.<a name=217:1></a> For instance, when the Son of God came into manhood, it was a movement of far-reaching importance; the bearing of it was such that it affected God and man.<a name=217:2></a> When the Lord Jesus took up His public ministry and service on earth, it was a movement of the deepest importance, and great consequences flow out of it.<a name=217:3></a> Again, when that same blessed Person died on the cross, it was a movement of immense magnitude and meaning, both for God and for men.<a name=217:4></a> Indeed, the bearing of it in its fulness we cannot possibly understand.<a name=217:5></a> Then when He rose from the dead, what significance was connected with that!<a name=217:6></a> What meaning!<a name=217:7></a> What a sphere was opened up for men in His resurrection!<a name=217:8></a> Finally when the Lord went up on high, who can measure what that involved, and the great issues bound up with it.<a name=217:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to dwell tonight on the significance of the last of these movements -- the Lord taking His place on high.<a name=217:10></a> Now this section of the Acts deals with the detail, and I should like to say a few words about the setting of these chapters, in order that you may follow what is on my mind.<a name=217:11></a> At the stoning of Stephen, the Lord Jesus was finally and definitely rejected by the Jews.<a name=217:12></a> He was rejected in His ministry and service to the nation, and on the cross

	<div class="paragraph">
		He was cast out as worthless.<a name=218:1></a> But here we find that He is seen in the vision of Stephen as standing at the right hand of God.<a name=218:2></a> He is <i>standing</i>, you will observe, not yet seated; and the testimony of Stephen to the nation was that he saw the heavens open and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.<a name=218:3></a> The Person whom they had rejected in His humiliation and reproach, was now in circumstances of power and glory, but He was not yet <i>seated</i> at the right hand of God.<a name=218:4></a> That is, He had not finally taken up His new position, and the fact that He is standing there suggests that from the glory, the Lord Jesus would make one more appeal to Israel.<a name=218:5></a> What an appeal it was!<a name=218:6></a> A marvellous appeal!<a name=218:7></a> The words of testimony came from the lips of a man who was very like Christ.<a name=218:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Stephen was a man who was formed in the moral features of Christ.<a name=218:9></a> Have you ever noticed how like the Lord he was when he died?<a name=218:10></a> It says of him, "And they stoned Stephen, praying, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7:59">Acts  7:59</a>).<a name=218:11></a> You remember what the Lord said: "Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit"(<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#23:46">Luke  23:46</a>).<a name=218:12></a> Here is a man, a follower of Jesus Christ, about to die a martyr's death, and what we see in him are the features and spirit of Christ.<a name=218:13></a> Stephen, however, could not possibly say, what no other but the Lord could say, "Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit:" but he could say, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit".<a name=218:14></a> That was as far as any other man could go.<a name=218:15></a> And then it adds, "Kneeling down, he cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7:60">Acts  7:60</a>).<a name=218:16></a> One is reminded of the loud voice with which the Lord Jesus cried when He was on the cross, indicating that He went out, not at the point of utter weakness and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=219>[Page 219]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		exhaustion, but at the point of strength.<a name=219:1></a> In that respect we see how much Stephen is like the Lord.<a name=219:2></a> And then when he said, "Lord, lay not this sin to their charge", it recalls what Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#23:34">Luke  23:34</a>).<a name=219:3></a> Stephen could not go further than, "Lord, lay not <i>this</i> sin to their charge".<a name=219:4></a> You see how iniquity and evil in the hands of men had progressed.<a name=219:5></a> The Lord Jesus accredited them with ignorance -- He said, "They know not what they do;" but Stephen has to say, "Lay not <i>this</i> sin to their charge".<a name=219:6></a> The sin was that they were about to slay Stephen, and so reject and refuse the appeal of the One who stood at the right hand of God.<a name=219:7></a> "And having said this, he fell asleep".<a name=219:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now from that point onwards you will find a great change in the character of things in this book of the Acts.<a name=219:9></a> Previously the great burden of the testimony, given by those who preached, was that Jesus is the Christ; but having been made, as we are told, "both Lord and Christ", we get the introduction of a new phase in the activity of the Lord Jesus.<a name=219:10></a> From that new position we find Him moving as Lord, and directly active from the right hand of God as Lord.<a name=219:11></a> Over and over again in chapter 8, you get the reference to the Lord.<a name=219:12></a> It says, "they were baptised to the name of the <i>Lord</i> Jesus" (verse 16); then, speaking "the word of the Lord" (verse 25); "the angel of the Lord" (verse 26); and then "the Spirit of the Lord" (verse 39).<a name=219:13></a> Thus we get in the chapter four suggestions, four features, connected with the lordship of Christ, as exercised from heaven at the right hand of God.<a name=219:14></a> First of all, the <i>name</i> of the Lord -- authority is connected with the name.<a name=219:15></a> Then we get the <i>word</i> of the Lord -- light is connected with the word.<a name=219:16></a> The <i>angel</i> of the
	</div>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Lord speaks of His intervention, His power to use angelic agencies in intervention on behalf of His people.<a name=220:1></a> And then finally you get the <i>Spirit</i> of the Lord, which is connected with the power that sustains His people.<a name=220:2></a> But I do not wish to dwell on those features, although they are full of the deepest interest.<a name=220:3></a> I only call attention here to the fact that the prominent thought throughout chapters 8 and 9, and onward, is that the Lord Jesus from the right hand of God is now directly taking control of the situation.<a name=220:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing that happened after the stoning of Stephen was that the disciples were scattered everywhere.<a name=220:5></a> It was the first general persecution of the saints; a movement, I do not doubt, of the enemy.<a name=220:6></a> Satan had seen on this earth, on the very spot where the feet of Jesus had trodden, a man who was exactly like Christ, like the Christ whom he had succeeded in putting out of this world.<a name=220:7></a> Here on this earth was a reproduction of Him -- a man who could live and die like Christ -- and at once the forces of evil are stirred up to greater activity, and this great persecution began which scattered the saints.<a name=220:8></a> But what is so helpful to see in regard of all Satan's movements is this, that the Lord allows him to go so far, and whenever Satan makes a move, it only serves to bring to pass something which the Lord Himself desired.<a name=220:9></a> The result of this persecution was that the saints were scattered, and they preached the word everywhere.<a name=220:10></a> Thus you see the first great result of the Lord's movements from on high is this, that evangelical activity is established as one of the great features of the kingdom of God.<a name=220:11></a> It says that Philip announced the glad tidings of the kingdom of God.<a name=220:12></a> And as we see this great effort on the part of the saints to reach out
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		to men -- they preached everywhere -- so we see also in the conversion of Saul of Tarsus an evidence of the subduing power of the Lord Jesus Christ, as active from the right hand of God.<a name=221:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul speaks of himself as the chief of sinners.<a name=221:2></a> When the chief of sinners can be subdued by the activity of the Lord, we do not need to fear to approach any man.<a name=221:3></a> There is not one remaining in the domain of darkness but can be subdued by the power of the Lord Jesus.<a name=221:4></a> He has power to subdue all things to Himself.<a name=221:5></a> Here, at the very beginning of this phase of things, the Lord manifests His power by reaching out His hand to one in the very stronghold of Satan, taking him who was chief and leader in the persecution of the saints, and bringing him right down to the earth.<a name=221:6></a> Now Paul is secured; he is the great vessel of the testimony as it is connected with the assembly.<a name=221:7></a> You will find that comes out later.<a name=221:8></a> At this moment he is secured in the kingdom, and for the kingdom, by the power of Him who is now supreme.<a name=221:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we come to the passages I read, where we get the activity of Peter.<a name=221:10></a> What I really have on my mind is this, that the kingdom of God is functioning today.<a name=221:11></a> It was functioning in that day, and it is doing so in this day with the same power, and there is no moral disease connected with sin, there is no power of evil as it presses upon men, but the kingdom of God can give deliverance from it.<a name=221:12></a> Peter finds out this man who had lain upon his couch for eight years.<a name=221:13></a> In the second instance I read, they <i>send</i> for Peter -- two men go for him -- but in the first instance Peter <i>finds</i> the man.<a name=221:14></a> It shows the two sides of activity in the kingdom of God.<a name=221:15></a> Now this man Aeneas, is not exactly a type of a

		sinner being converted, but rather of one who is in the kingdom, but who is not getting all the gain and blessing connected with being there.<a name=222:1></a> Many of God's people are in that case today, that is, they are not getting all the gain from the kingdom of God, that the Lord would have them get, and it is of very great interest to notice what Peter says to this paralytic man.<a name=222:2></a> It is this, "Jesus, the Christ, heals thee".<a name=222:3></a> Peter does not say, 'Jesus, the Christ, will heal thee'.<a name=222:4></a> What he emphasises is the present bearing and functioning of the kingdom of God, in the power which proceeds from the right hand of God.<a name=222:5></a> The thing was operative and operating, it was going on, it was present, and Peter would make Aeneas acquainted with it.<a name=222:6></a> He says, "Jesus, the Christ, heals thee".<a name=222:7></a> I hope you see the bearing of that, particularly the younger ones, for it is a great thing to apprehend that the kingdom of God is acting in real living power from day to day.<a name=222:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		You remember the case of the impotent man who is spoken of in the gospel of John.<a name=222:9></a> It says that he had had his infirmity for thirty-eight years.<a name=222:10></a> When the Lord found him, he began his sad and sorrowful story, that he waited for the moving of the waters, when at a certain season an angel came, and there was healing for the one who stepped down first.<a name=222:11></a> That kind of intervention was only an occasional one; it was not in force all the time.<a name=222:12></a> But what Peter brings to bear on this paralytic man is that the power to heal is available, it is present, it is going on all the time -- "Jesus, the Christ, heals thee".<a name=222:13></a> And then he goes on, "Rise up, and make thy couch for thyself".<a name=222:14></a> Now, let us see just what this incident stands for.<a name=222:15></a> Here is a man in the kingdom of God, and what marks him is that he is lying upon his couch.<a name=222:16></a> I

		My thought is to speak further about the lordship of Christ.<a name=229:1></a> I am greatly impressed with the conviction that, generally speaking, there is failure to apprehend the bearing and import of this.<a name=229:2></a> We often bemoan our lack of appreciation of the headship of Christ, of all the blessedness that resides in Him as Head, but I feel that this arises in the main from failure to understand His lordship, without learning which, we cannot move on to what is connected with headship.<a name=229:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing I would call attention to is that Christ is Lord by divine appointment, as it says in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:36">Acts  2:36</a> "God has made him, this Jesus whom <i>ye</i> have crucified, both Lord and Christ".<a name=229:4></a> This is a divine appointment which must be recognised, and bowed to by every man.<a name=229:5></a> True, the Lord is not asserting His rights as Lord publicly in the world today.<a name=229:6></a> Were He to do so it would mean the end of the world-system, and the judgment of all who refused to bow.<a name=229:7></a> For when He publicly asserts His rights, He will do it with all the authority and power connected with His place as Lord.<a name=229:8></a> He is, however, bringing the claims of His lordship to bear upon His people, so that they may come into the gain of the kingdom of God now by responding to those claims.<a name=229:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The thought of lordship is connected with the individual pathway of God's people, and has to do with the

	<div class="paragraph">
		wilderness, whereas headship is connected with what is collective.<a name=230:1></a> In all that pertains to our responsible path, we are called upon to recognise the authority of the One who is Lord and Christ.<a name=230:2></a> While this, as I have remarked, has relation to the individual, yet it is universal in its bearing.<a name=230:3></a> The context of the scripture we have read shows that representatives of the three great divisions of Noah's family -- Shem, Ham and Japheth -- are brought into blessing as under the authority of the Lord; showing that the Lord's activities at the right hand of God are not restricted to one nation or race, but that as Lord He has universal rights which extend to all men, and which He can enforce at any moment.<a name=230:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two simple thoughts connected with lordship, namely, authority and administration.<a name=230:5></a> Authority comes first.<a name=230:6></a> We have a beautiful type illustrating these, and showing the setting of the two thoughts, in Joseph in Egypt.<a name=230:7></a> He was put in the place of authority, and the people were told to regulate themselves by his commandment (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#41:40">Genesis  41:40</a>), and when the time of famine came, the word of Pharaoh was, "Go to Joseph" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#41:55">Genesis  41:55</a>).<a name=230:8></a> There we see the combination of authority and administration.<a name=230:9></a> Authority is necessary as a prelude to administration, in order that the blessing might be made available.<a name=230:10></a> What is in Christ is to be made available; that is, the administrative side of the kingdom, and it is made available for the very humblest.<a name=230:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are four distinct features of the kingdom of God, which are suggested in the verses before us.<a name=230:12></a> They are, the <i>name</i> of the Lord, the <i>word</i> of the Lord, the <i>angel</i> of the Lord, and the <i>Spirit</i> of the Lord.<a name=230:13></a> These expressions

	<div class="paragraph">
		refer to great things, and I trust that grace may be given me to speak of them in such a way that our affections may be touched.<a name=231:1></a> I shall speak first of the <i>name</i> of the Lord.<a name=231:2></a> I wonder if we realise what an asset we have in the name.<a name=231:3></a> It is more than a designation or a description, which identifies a certain person in our minds.<a name=231:4></a> It carries with it the thought of the authority and power connected with that blessed Person at the right hand of God.<a name=231:5></a> The name involves the setting forth in testimony of all that was presented personally in Christ.<a name=231:6></a> The name of the Lord is a priceless possession for His people.<a name=231:7></a> It is said to be a strong tower, into which the righteous run and are safe.<a name=231:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish now to bring forward some examples, showing the authority and power of the name.<a name=231:9></a> You will recall that in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#4:7">Acts  4:7</a>, when Peter and John were called upon by the rulers to give an account as to the healing of the lame man, the challenge they had to meet was this, "In what power or in what name have <i>ye</i> done this?<a name=231:10></a>" If men do not realise the value of the name of the Lord, the powers of darkness know something of its power!<a name=231:11></a> What disturbed the minds of these religious leaders was that another name was being witnessed to amongst men.<a name=231:12></a> Behind that name was the authority of a kingdom greater than the kingdom of darkness, a kingdom that was not powerless in face of all man's need, but which carried with it the power of healing in the name.<a name=231:13></a> That name will be a passport to us; it will enable us to travel among men untouched and unscathed, even where the powers of darkness seem to be supreme.<a name=231:14></a> The confession of the name will bring salvation (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#10:9">Romans  10:9</a>).<a name=231:15></a> There is no power in saying that we hold certain religious

		<a name=232>[Page 232]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		views.<a name=232:1></a> A Unitarian, who denies the deity of Christ, could say that; the power is in the confession of the name.<a name=232:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I refer to another example of the power of the name.<a name=232:3></a> It is recorded of Saul of Tarsus, that as he travelled to Damascus, suddenly there shone round about him a light out of heaven, and falling on the earth, he heard a voice.<a name=232:4></a> There was something about that voice that affected Saul of Tarsus.<a name=232:5></a> He had never heard anything like it before; there was something about it that brought these words to his lips: "Who art thou, Lord?<a name=232:6></a>" These words would not come lightly, or easily to the lips of that haughty, proud Pharisee, now lying on the earth.<a name=232:7></a> The voice he heard indicated that the Person who spoke was "Lord".<a name=232:8></a> He spoke with an authority that could not be denied.<a name=232:9></a> The Lord answered, "<i>I</i> am Jesus".<a name=232:10></a> What a precious disclosure to know that Person as Jesus -- the name that speaks of His lowliness, of His down-stooping love, of His service to man!<a name=232:11></a> How our hearts are touched with the appealing grace connected with it!<a name=232:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then another instance we find in Mary, in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:2">John  20:2</a>, when she went to the sepulchre to seek Jesus.<a name=232:13></a> "They have taken away the Lord", she said.<a name=232:14></a> So far as Mary knew He was but a dead Man, but dead or alive He was <i>her</i> Lord.<a name=232:15></a> The limits of His lordship to her were not defined by death, and death was no interruption of His authority over Mary.<a name=232:16></a> Dead or alive, He was Lord to her.<a name=232:17></a> "Tell me where thou hast laid him", she said, "and I will take him away" (verse 15).<a name=232:18></a> What a proposal for a poor weak woman to make!<a name=232:19></a> Where could she take Him?<a name=232:20></a> What could she do with One who was dead?<a name=232:21></a> Mary's love recognised no limitations or barriers.<a name=232:22></a> She would undertake anything to have her Lord.<a name=232:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=233>[Page 233]</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Another example is found in Thomas.<a name=233:1></a> He was not with the other disciples when Jesus came and stood in the midst; and he was unbelieving when told that others had seen the Lord.<a name=233:2></a> Thomas had accepted the Lord as living and moving amongst men, but was not prepared to accept Him without special manifestation, as having passed through death into the triumph of resurrection.<a name=233:3></a> But there came a time, eight days after (a long period to miss the gain of the risen Lord), when Jesus came again with a special word for Thomas, and then Thomas said, "My Lord and my God" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#20:28">John  20:28</a>).<a name=233:4></a> He now knew that the Person who stood before him in resurrection life was his Lord.<a name=233:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One more example occurs to me, this time showing the power of the name, not only over an enemy or a follower, but over one who, it might be said, had prior rights.<a name=233:6></a> In <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#19:29">Luke  19:29</a> - 36 the Lord sent two of his disciples to bring the colt that was tied.<a name=233:7></a> And as they were loosing the colt, its masters said to the disciples, "Why loose ye the colt?<a name=233:8></a> And they said, Because the Lord has need of it".<a name=233:9></a> The name of the Lord was at once the authority for taking the colt.<a name=233:10></a> It was not an enemy who was challenging the disciples, but those who thought they had prior rights.<a name=233:11></a> But even then, when that word came, "The Lord has need of it", there was an end of all priority.<a name=233:12></a> Let me make a simple application.<a name=233:13></a> Many a time the Lord Jesus has laid His hand on a boy or a girl in an unconverted family.<a name=233:14></a> Perhaps the Lord's right to take the first place in that young person's heart has been challenged by parents.<a name=233:15></a> But all prior rights and claims, of whatever character, have to give way to the Lord's supreme claim.<a name=233:16></a> It is no use trying to resist it, for what the Lord claims He holds.<a name=233:17></a> What I wish

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there is a striking scripture in the Acts, showing the power of the name as restraining the activities of evil powers.<a name=234:2></a> "And certain of the Jewish exorcists also, who went about, took in hand to call upon those who had wicked spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, I adjure you by Jesus, whom Paul preaches" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#19:13">Acts  19:13</a>).<a name=234:3></a> Notice that it was the <i>name of the Lord Jesus</i> they took in hand to call upon them, but what they actually said was, "I adjure you by Jesus" -- not the Lord Jesus.<a name=234:4></a> The word says: "no one can say, Lord Jesus, unless in the power of the Holy Spirit" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:3">1 Corinthians  12:3</a>).<a name=234:5></a> That is a plain, positive statement.<a name=234:6></a> I have been about the world a bit, and into some rough places, and I have heard men curse, using the names of divine Persons in many varieties of blasphemy, but I have never heard a man curse in the name of the Lord Jesus.<a name=234:7></a> In the name of Jesus?<a name=234:8></a> Yes, in the world that precious name is only considered fit to add point to some filthy jest, but the apostle affirms that no man can say <i>Lord</i> Jesus, unless in the power of the Holy Spirit.<a name=234:9></a> Those seven sons of Sceva could effect nothing; they were overcome, and fled naked, and wounded.<a name=234:10></a> The evil spirit said to them, "Jesus I know, and Paul I am acquainted with; but <i>ye</i>, who are ye?<a name=234:11></a>" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#19:15">Acts  19:15</a>).<a name=234:12></a> The powers of darkness know well and recognise the power of the name of the Lord.<a name=234:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The thought behind the expression, the word of the Lord, as I understand it, is that the word has all the authority of the Lord.<a name=236:2></a> Even in the religious world today the Scriptures are not accepted as having authority.<a name=236:3></a> Men talk as though the word of the Lord was submitted to them for analysis and criticism, to see if it is worth accepting.<a name=236:4></a> So they discard and dissect and refuse, the divinely inspired utterances at the whim of so-called scientific criticism.<a name=236:5></a> But the Scriptures come to us with all the authority of the One who sits at God's right hand.<a name=236:6></a> It is not a question of whether I am prepared to accept them.<a name=236:7></a> There they are, and they stand accredited with all the authority of the Lord, and we cannot disregard them.<a name=236:8></a> Hence, if the Lord is pleased to give us light which involves any change in our ways, in order to bring our manner of life into accordance with the light, it is serious to disregard it.<a name=236:9></a> For the light is authoritative, and to refuse it may bring us under severe discipline.<a name=236:10></a> Who can question the Lord's right to discipline His people?<a name=236:11></a> Who can deny Him this right?<a name=236:12></a> As Lord, He is set to break down all self-will and insubjection on our part, because they stand in the way of His love.<a name=236:13></a> Disobedience was the first thing that came in to break the conditions connected with the garden of Eden.<a name=236:14></a> Now <i>obedience</i> is to mark the entry into the kingdom of God.<a name=236:15></a> We have to <i>obey</i> the gospel.<a name=236:16></a> It is not a question of taking it, or leaving it; the bearing of the gospel is authoritative.<a name=236:17></a> It is presented for the obedience of faith, not for analysis, research, or investigation by the natural mind.<a name=236:18></a> The gospel does not

		I should like to emphasise the authority of the word of God.<a name=237:2></a> Do not think you can afford to slight or disregard any measure of light that the Lord may give you.<a name=237:3></a> The word of the Lord is authoritative, and if we do not take heed thereto, we shall have to come under discipline.<a name=237:4></a> His love is of such a character that He could not rest content with anything short of having us all for Himself.<a name=237:5></a> The lordship of Christ would protect us from every foe, and secure us wholly for Himself.<a name=237:6></a> It would put us in a sphere where He can do what He will with us; it would expand and enlarge us in preparation for still greater things.<a name=237:7></a> We travel through the kingdom of God, so to speak, in order to reach the assembly.<a name=237:8></a> In the kingdom we are subdued, and our wills broken, and thus we are prepared to take up corporate relations with each other.<a name=237:9></a> The assembly speaks of what is for Christ.<a name=237:10></a> He gave Himself for it, and only the whole assembly can satisfy His heart.<a name=237:11></a> We can thus see the necessity of first coming individually under the subduing power of the kingdom, so that we may be qualified to take up assembly relations, in which the individual is to be merged.<a name=237:12></a> If we try to take up assembly relations with unsubdued spirits, we shall be a source of concern, and a hindrance to the Lord's people.<a name=237:13></a> Would you not like, dear young believer, to grow up comely and straight amongst your brethren, not warped this way or that, but as fitting in with them, and a comfort to them?<a name=237:14></a> If you travel by way of the kingdom, under the protection of the name of the Lord, and as submissive to the word of the Lord, when you take up assembly relations you will make progress in that

		My thought is to speak about the features of the kingdom of God, which are suggested in the two expressions, "the angel of the Lord", and "the Spirit of the Lord".<a name=241:1></a> I shall say but a brief word about the first, because I feel what is connected with the second feature is of primary importance.<a name=241:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What a great thing it would be if some heart in this company tonight were definitely secured for the Lord.<a name=241:3></a> In saying that I am not thinking about unconverted persons.<a name=241:4></a> You may have been converted for many years; you may even be breaking bread, and yet your heart not be wholly secured for the Lord.<a name=241:5></a> Scripture abounds in examples which show what God can and does effect with one whose heart is devoted wholly to Himself.<a name=241:6></a> What an asset it would be, not only to the district in which you reside, but to the assembly of God, if your soul should be wholly secured for the Lord!<a name=241:7></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to show, dear young people, what I have in mind when I speak of your being secured for Christ.<a name=242:3></a> It is that you should take up christianity as a living thing every day, as that which actuates you all day, as the controlling feature of your life, and to which everything else is incidental and subservient.<a name=242:4></a> That is what marks a heart secured for Christ.<a name=242:5></a> The intent of divine Persons, in their activities amongst the Lord's people, is that we should be spiritual.<a name=242:6></a> In Old Testament times God would be approached only by the priests.<a name=242:7></a> They represent spiritual persons, and God wants such.<a name=242:8></a> His end is not secured unless we are formed in what is spiritual.<a name=242:9></a> Piety is a good thing; it is a feature of christian life that Scripture makes much of; but you can be pious, attend meetings regularly, and yet not be spiritual.<a name=242:10></a> The distinction between those who get on in their souls, and those who do not, is a question of spirituality.<a name=242:11></a> How blessed it would be if you made such progress that you stopped at no point short of the divine intention.<a name=242:12></a> If Satan can stop us at some point of soul history short of the Lord's thought for us, he has done all the damage he can.<a name=242:13></a> But all the influences with which the Lord would surround us would encourage us to move on.<a name=242:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I turn now to the thought of the angel of the Lord.<a name=242:15></a> You will recall that we have considered the meaning of the Lord's present place at the right hand of God.<a name=242:16></a> He is now in

		the place of authority, so that the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ may be administered to His people.<a name=243:1></a> The Lord Jesus has every necessary agency to maintain His activity amongst His saints.<a name=243:2></a> The thought of "the angel of the Lord" is perhaps more connected with the Lord's movements amongst His people as regards what is providential.<a name=243:3></a> For instance, in our chapter, it was the angel of the Lord who spoke to Philip saying, "Rise up and go southward on the way which goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza: the same is desert".<a name=243:4></a> But it was the Spirit that said to Philip, "Approach and join this chariot".<a name=243:5></a> There you see the distinction; the angel has to do with getting Philip from Samaria to the desert, and the Spirit has to do with the moral work.<a name=243:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Spirit is always engaged with what is moral or spiritual.<a name=243:7></a> I will try and make the distinction between the moral and the spiritual in a moment.<a name=243:8></a> It was an angel of the Lord that smote Peter on the side, while he was sleeping in prison, and rousing him up spoke to him, saying, "Follow me" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#12:8">Acts  12:8</a>).<a name=243:9></a> It was an angel who appeared to Paul on that night of fear, with shipwreck ahead, and said, "Fear not, Paul" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#27:24">Acts  27:24</a>).<a name=243:10></a> In these instances the activities of the angel are connected with the Lord's intervention providentially.<a name=243:11></a> The import and bearing to us is this: that the Lord Jesus from His place at the right hand of God knows how to put His people into circumstances, or to take them out of them, in a way best calculated to promote what is spiritual.<a name=243:12></a> He knows the exact time in our history to bring in some trial, and how to bring in some great pressure, such as the death of a loved one, the loss of a situation, or some other depressing circumstance.<a name=243:13></a> His

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I now come to the second feature, connected with the expression, "the Spirit of the Lord".<a name=244:5></a> Administration is connected with the Spirit.<a name=244:6></a> When the moment came for the ministering of Christ to the eunuch, it is the Spirit who speaks.<a name=244:7></a> It is in this way we get the gain of the present moment.<a name=244:8></a> I trust the Lord will help me in speaking of this side of things, because it is the point where many miss their way.<a name=244:9></a> I feel sure that most, if not all of us, have some measure of appreciation of the work of Christ.<a name=244:10></a> The work of that blessed Person stands out prominently in our minds but I wonder what measure of appreciation we have of the work of the Holy Spirit.<a name=244:11></a> Yet it is in connection with His operations that the great question of spiritual capacity lies.<a name=244:12></a> It is our spiritual capacity that determines the measure of blessing we can contain.<a name=244:13></a> Our measure is connected with the Spirit's work.<a name=244:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is not without significance that the time of the Lord's sojourn on earth was short, and His public activities confined to a very small area.<a name=244:15></a> In fact as we read the words of Jesus recorded in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>, we gather the impression that the Lord regarded the day of His presence at the right hand of God, and the Spirit's presence down here in believers, as a greater day for His own than their having Him with them on earth.<a name=244:16></a> The Lord speaks too, of their doing greater

		In the religious world around, Satan has well nigh succeeded in taking from the minds of those who profess christianity, all thought of the presence of the Holy Spirit as a divine Person.<a name=245:3></a> We can learn this from the movements of the enemy, for we are not ignorant of his thoughts (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#2:11">2 Corinthians  2:11</a>).<a name=245:4></a> Whenever you see the enemy concentrating an attack upon a certain feature of the truth, you may be sure there is some definite blessing in that feature.<a name=245:5></a> I press this because I feel there is lack in this regard amongst those with whom we walk.<a name=245:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The passage read in Matthew's gospel shows that Satanic activity is intensified by the outward cleansing connected with a Christless christianity.<a name=245:7></a> An unclean spirit is cast out of a man.<a name=245:8></a> The great question is what is to take its place, and become the controlling power of the man.<a name=245:9></a> The divine thought is that the Spirit of God should take that place.<a name=245:10></a> If the place is not occupied by the Spirit of God, it will be reoccupied by evil spirits, and not one, but eight.<a name=245:11></a> They return and find the place swept and adorned; that is the mere profession of christianity, which, though it brings about certain benefits, yet only makes room for enlarged evil activity.<a name=245:12></a> What a picture of the religious world today!<a name=245:13></a> The name of Christ is but a cover for intensified Satanic activity.<a name=245:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		in believers, not as an influence as is taught, but as a Person.<a name=246:1></a> This is a fact, not merely a doctrine, and a fact of far-reaching importance.<a name=246:2></a> Paul says, "Do ye not know that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?<a name=246:3></a>" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3:16">1 Corinthians  3:16</a>).<a name=246:4></a> All privilege open to us is consequent on the presence of the Spirit.<a name=246:5></a> The second feature is the line of the Spirit's activity.<a name=246:6></a> "For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#5:17">Galatians  5:17</a>).<a name=246:7></a> Here we see the line of the Spirit's activity, always against the flesh.<a name=246:8></a> The third feature is the normal work of the Spirit, which is unfolded in Colossians and Ephesians.<a name=246:9></a> Moral things are unfolded in Romans and Corinthians.<a name=246:10></a> The distinction between moral and spiritual is that moral things involve the question of good and evil.<a name=246:11></a> God has been pleased to reveal Himself, and this has great consequences for men.<a name=246:12></a> It brings to light the distinction between good and evil.<a name=246:13></a> Good takes character from God.<a name=246:14></a> It is connected with what God is, and the attendant issues of good and evil that arise out of the revelation of God are moral things.<a name=246:15></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now to be spiritual is just this -- it is to have capacity formed in us to enjoy spiritual things.<a name=246:16></a> Our measure of spirituality is the measure in which the Holy Spirit has taken effect in us.<a name=246:17></a> What I am speaking of now lies beyond the question of flesh working in us, and the Spirit being against the flesh, and the great power in us by which we judge the flesh.<a name=246:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I pass on now to the consideration of the expression, "the Spirit of the Lord".<a name=246:19></a> You must have noticed in reading Scripture, how many titles are given to the Holy Spirit.<a name=246:20></a> We get "the Spirit of God", "the Spirit of God's Son", "the

		Spirit of Christ", "the Spirit of promise", etc.<a name=247:1></a> Each title is suggestive of the Spirit's activity in that particular connection.<a name=247:2></a> The "Spirit of the Lord", refers to the Spirit's activity in making good to us all that the Lord has made available for us.<a name=247:3></a> How comforting it is to think that there is One here, in and with the believer, who knows perfectly all that is in Christ.<a name=247:4></a> If we take account of our measure of knowledge of Christ, it is very small, but what a comfort it is to know that there is a divine Person indwelling believers for the purpose of making known every feature of Christ which has been expressed in Him as Man here.<a name=247:5></a> The Spirit knows and treasures every feature of the glory of Christ.<a name=247:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I referred to authority and administration as two features connected with the thought of lordship.<a name=247:7></a> We now see how administration is going to come into operation.<a name=247:8></a> It is by the Spirit of the Lord making available to us what is in Christ as Lord.<a name=247:9></a> I wonder if we are all learning from that source.<a name=247:10></a> Do we all value that source?<a name=247:11></a> It is better than books -- the means used by man to acquire knowledge.<a name=247:12></a> This is what a divine Person makes known to the people of God.<a name=247:13></a> How shall we ever learn in the flesh and blood condition, in weakness and humiliation here, what Christ is at the right hand of God for us, apart from this divine Teacher?<a name=247:14></a> And we do well to note that as the Spirit of the Lord the Spirit is here in all the authority of the Lord.<a name=247:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In another place the Spirit is called "the Spirit of grace", and of some it says they had "insulted the Spirit of grace" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:29">Hebrews  10:29</a>).<a name=247:16></a> As the Spirit of grace, the Holy Spirit is presented in all the grace of Christ.<a name=247:17></a> Grace can be refused, the Spirit of grace can be treated insultingly.<a name=247:18></a>

		I wish to use these scriptures to illustrate the thought of soul progress.<a name=253:1></a> In this book, the Spirit of God has been pleased to indicate how a person may become at home with the people of God and have a living part in spiritual history.<a name=253:2></a> Not every believer has a living part in spiritual history; that is to say, not every name may be incorporated in the thought of <i>the generation</i>, as having treasured what is spiritual and handed it on to others.<a name=253:3></a>

		Meetings are to be continued on the principle of the generation, from one to another.<a name=253:4></a> In chapter 4, we have presented the generation that is passing, represented in Naomi.<a name=253:5></a> We now see her without any sense of bitterness or loss, holding in her bosom a child that is said to be born unto her.<a name=253:6></a> Ruth represents the present and fruitful generation, holding the testimony in a place and taking up what is for God.<a name=253:7></a> The child represents the new generation that is to carry on the line of David; but you will notice that certain persons are missing.<a name=253:8></a> In this bit of history recorded in Israel, certain ones are lost.<a name=253:9></a> There were graves in Moab, possibly bearing the names of Elimelech, Mahlon, and Chilion, but they were not in the land.<a name=253:10></a> They missed their way because at a time of famine amongst the people of God they refused to face the exercises of famine; and, in order to find food, they went to Moab, a lower level where spiritual life cannot be sustained.<a name=253:11></a>

		In a kind of way, there is a famine today.<a name=254:1></a> Some of the saints are facing the exercise of it with God; others, I fear, are seeking to avoid it -- seeking to find an easier way.<a name=254:2></a> If you look abroad in christendom, you will notice that there are many platforms -- many different levels -- on which you may pursue christianity.<a name=254:3></a> You may take it up according to the highest platform, where every feature of the truth is held livingly and vitally.<a name=254:4></a> But if you find that position makes too many demands, you have not to travel very far to find some lower level which will make fewer demands.<a name=254:5></a> If you do not like that, you may go still further afield and find some nominal position in christendom which makes no demands at all and where well nigh every feature of the truth has been given up.<a name=254:6></a> Accordingly, you will see the importance of facing famine exercises with God, for He has not deserted His people.<a name=254:7></a> As He sees the need of it, He may chasten us with trying circumstances; and the affliction may be severe for a time; but God is with His people.<a name=254:8></a> Those who stayed in Israel at the time of famine proved that, for the time came when God visited His people with plenty.<a name=254:9></a> Naomi came back to join in the plenty, but the experience and knowledge of God had been missed.<a name=254:10></a> This may be the histories of some meetings, and frequently one finds that a generation is missing.<a name=254:11></a> You see grandparents and grandchildren, but the intervening generation has been lost to the testimony, perhaps in the land of Moab.<a name=254:12></a>

		In pursuing this line, I begin at the point where Ruth, in her gleaning, chanced to light on the field of Boaz.<a name=255:6></a> In verse 3 it says, "and she chanced to light on an allotment of Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech".<a name=255:7></a> I would put some emphasis on the word "chanced" as suggesting what seems to be accidental.<a name=255:8></a> There may be some young believers whose connections with the people of God are in a way accidental.<a name=255:9></a> Perhaps your father and mother were in the meeting before you, and you have never been elsewhere.<a name=255:10></a> You are not here by your own choice, as yet, but on account of your parents.<a name=255:11></a> Ruth chanced to light on an allotment of Boaz.<a name=255:12></a> I wonder whether you young people have realised that.<a name=255:13></a> Do you realise that this allotment -- this parcel of land on which you find yourselves -- apparently by incident of birth, belongs to Christ?<a name=255:14></a> Boaz is a figure of Christ and it is His field.<a name=255:15></a> He has labourers -- and you are to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This young woman, Ruth, began at that point.<a name=256:10></a> It was a good point for a beginning, but Boaz came along and noticed her and made inquiry as to "Whose maiden is this?<a name=256:11></a>" Are you conscious that the Lord has noticed you, that He has made some inquiry about you, or have you never had the sense of His special attention in this way?<a name=256:12></a> What a wonderful thing in a person's history when he or she becomes conscious that the Lord is inquiring about them.<a name=256:13></a> I think the Lord does that, and I think it comes to light in this way: the brethren begin to say, 'There is young so-and-so who has never made any definite move yet, but he is always at the meeting, and so we will pray for him'.<a name=256:14></a> When the Lord is beginning to make some inquiry about you, you will find some reflection, some answer in the hearts of those that are near Him -- who are

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Boaz charged Ruth in a way that is full of instruction.<a name=257:4></a> She was not to glean in any other field than his, for there was food there, and water too when she was thirsty.<a name=257:5></a> Not to glean in any other field alludes to a point where things become definite in one's soul.<a name=257:6></a> I want to press this side of the truth, for arriving at this would take one beyond being in a meeting merely incidentally, and put one there happily as having a living part in it; and to this end, the not gleaning in any other field is very important.<a name=257:7></a> Many do not get on in their souls because they glean in some other field.<a name=257:8></a> They want a little bit of Christ and so much of the world; five minutes over their Bibles, and an hour and a half over a novel; a little bit for Christ just to maintain the position respectably, and then a big bit of the world.<a name=257:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Do we realise that the field of Boaz contains all we need, for there is food and drink there, and there are young men -- that is to say, workers -- who will not interfere with us.<a name=257:10></a> They recognise how small is the measure of young people, just beginning to wake up to the preciousness of Christ; and that such can take only a little bit here and there, and they will not interfere with you.<a name=257:11></a> Perhaps, in a few broken sentences, you begin to pray in the meeting.<a name=257:12></a> The young men will not interfere with you -- not if they are

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In soul progress, the next step which comes before me at the moment is this: that this maiden comes under the notice of Boaz again in a special way (<a href="../bible/Ruth.htm#2:8">Ruth  2:8</a>).<a name=258:5></a> It says, "her sitting in the house has been little as yet" (chapter 2: 7).<a name=258:6></a> Some of us may be like that.<a name=258:7></a> We may have been connected with the meeting a long time and not gained very much, but Ruth came under the notice of Boaz in a special way, and he instructed the young men to let fall for her handfuls of purpose.<a name=258:8></a> I think typically, she had reached a point in her soul where she could not be satisfied merely with being at the meetings, and reading a Bible text from the calendar every morning and a few verses of scripture before going to sleep, but her soul needed something more.<a name=258:9></a> You come under the Lord's notice in a special way, when you are prepared to tell Him that you want something of purpose, divine purpose.<a name=258:10></a> These young men, reapers in the field of Boaz, know how to drop handfuls of purpose.<a name=258:11></a> They would be like some brother or sister who understands where a young man or a young woman is in soul history, and has prayed for such and followed them up, and something comes out of the scriptures that just suits their case.<a name=258:12></a> That is a handful of purpose.<a name=258:13></a> The purpose is the Lord's, of course; but He knows what your need is, and He sees to it that some handful of purpose is dropped for you.<a name=258:14></a> We can all

		With the thought of spiritual history before us, we now see that this young woman is brought into the gain of redemption; and, as feeling the importance of it, I would linger a moment to speak about redemption.<a name=259:14></a> Many would make redemption just the forgiveness of sins; but, as I understand it, it is a greater thought, having in view that we should be known as persons who belong to Christ absolutely, not merely those who have just a certain interest in Christ.<a name=259:15></a> Forgiveness of sins would bring relief of conscience and make us at home with God, assured of His

	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 4 the matter of redemption is gone into, and in view of the practical bearing of the truth, let me point out for a moment that this question of redemption involves the exercise of the whole meeting.<a name=260:7></a> Indeed, here a care meeting was called about it, showing that those responsible in the locality must understand the bearing of redemption, if we are to impress upon the younger brethren who have not yet wholly committed themselves to Christ, the fact that they have been purchased.<a name=260:8></a> Boaz called the elders of the city to sit down, for this was a serious matter.<a name=260:9></a> It was not merely a question of saying something to the brethren on the way home.<a name=260:10></a> This occasion is one calling for the most definite care and the elders of the city all sat down, and the whole matter was gone into thoroughly.<a name=260:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What I would like to point out in relation to redemption, as it is presented here, is that, not only are the persons taken into account, but their whole history as well -- the history of Elimelech, Chilion and Mahlon and all they possessed.<a name=260:12></a> When you realise that the Lord has bought you absolutely, you learn also that He has purchased

		The conclusion of this matter is a most happy one, for the Spirit of God introduces a bit of spiritual history.<a name=263:4></a> You will have noticed that spiritual history is often interwoven with failure, but God can forget the failure, and the saints can forget failure too, for God's people are remarkably like Him.<a name=263:5></a> What God can forget, we can forget; and although this history of failure is interwoven with spiritual history, it is what comes out of failure that God delights in.<a name=263:6></a> God is righteous in forgetting the failure, for the price of redemption has been paid.<a name=263:7></a>

		Many of us, no doubt, have histories of failure, and I would just ask this question in closing: Does that history of failure hinder you?<a name=264:5></a> I do not mean that failure can be ignored and lightly thrown away out of our memories, but I would suggest that the bearing of redemption is such that God can give you liberty from every kind of bondage.<a name=264:6></a> For the very basis of the word "redemption" is that we should be set free.<a name=264:7></a> God would set His people free.<a name=264:8></a> He has a way of dealing with everything that holds them.<a name=264:9></a> There is a divine way, and if any are being held back from entering into all that which belongs to the people of God, I would urge upon you that there is a divine way by which every shackle can be broken; for the price has been paid.<a name=264:10></a> The basis of these divine operations was established in the blood of Jesus, and God wants His people -- He wants you, He wants me -- to be free.<a name=264:11></a> No bond can hold us away from Christ.<a name=264:12></a> I repeat that no shackle need bind us, for there is a divine way by which every such bond can be broken, and we may therefore come into the liberty, the joy, and the happiness of redemption and be attached by spiritual history to what is of God here.<a name=264:13></a>

		profession, and the outstanding feature with him is spirituality.<a name=282:1></a> Peter is serving amongst the brethren, and as serving thus, what is stressed is the great need of patience, as we see in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2">Acts  2</a>.<a name=282:2></a> Then we come to Paul.<a name=282:3></a> His service is described in chapter 13, where we find him serving in a sphere of hostility to Christ, but he is marked by great boldness and moral power.<a name=282:4></a> It is of these three features I would speak -- spirituality, patience, and power.<a name=282:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Most of us are acquainted with the history of Stephen, and I refer particularly to his beginning.<a name=282:6></a> It is said that "they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit".<a name=282:7></a> Thus we are shown a vessel who was full, there was no admixture, there were no double motives with Stephen.<a name=282:8></a> He was a filled vessel, "full of faith and the Holy Spirit".<a name=282:9></a> These features marked him as amongst the saints, but we also read of Stephen's public movements in service, and then he is said to be "full of grace and power", not faith exactly, for faith is the inward thing, but "full of grace and power".<a name=282:10></a> These four features regarding Stephen are of great importance.<a name=282:11></a> He was full of faith and the Holy Spirit, and then he was full of grace and power.<a name=282:12></a> That is the basis from which Stephen's remarkable service flows forth.<a name=282:13></a> It was not, as we know, a lengthy service, but it was powerful and he served as being filled.<a name=282:14></a> Oh!<a name=282:15></a> that one might serve like that!<a name=282:16></a> If the servant is filled, there is no room for admixture, no room for ulterior or double motives in the service.<a name=282:17></a> Then it is said that being full of grace and power, Stephen did great wonders and miracles among the people.<a name=282:18></a> His deportment, as serving, reminds us, surely, of the grace and features of another Man, even the Lord Jesus Christ as seen in Luke's gospel.<a name=282:19></a>

		I would plead for greater attention to this matter of spirituality in service.<a name=283:1></a> In Luke's gospel we are reminded of persons who were filled with the Spirit.<a name=283:2></a> Thus John the baptist, and Zacharias, and Elizabeth, are all said to have been filled with the Holy Spirit.<a name=283:3></a> Then it is said of Mary: "The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:35">Luke  1:35</a>), and again of Simeon that "the Holy Spirit was upon him.<a name=283:4></a> And it was divinely communicated to him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death before he should see the Lord's Christ" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:25">Luke  2:25</a>, 26).<a name=283:5></a> Then, which is surely a very important feature, it is said of Simeon that "he came in the Spirit into the temple" (verse 27).<a name=283:6></a> What a trustworthy vessel is this man, one, as we may say, moving entirely under the control of the Holy Spirit.<a name=283:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now these are the individuals who have to do with the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=283:8></a> They are privileged to encircle and to handle, as Simeon did, "the holy thing" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:35">Luke  1:35</a>).<a name=283:9></a> One would speak guardedly in reference to "the holy thing" -- how much spirituality is needed to speak of that!<a name=283:10></a> There is Simeon in spiritual power, and as he took the Babe in his arms, he blessed God.<a name=283:11></a> That was an evidence of His spirituality; and after he had blessed God, he blessed Joseph and Mary.<a name=283:12></a> In <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#10">Luke  10</a>we have one who as having set herself down at Jesus' feet, was listening to His word.<a name=283:13></a> Following that we have the request on the part of one of the disciples who heard Jesus praying, "Lord, teach us to pray" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#11:1">Luke  11:1</a>).<a name=283:14></a> I mention these things, hearing and praying particularly, because of what occurs in chapter 12.<a name=283:15></a> It is said that the multitude was so great that they trod one on another.<a name=283:16></a> This marks men today in increasing measure.<a name=283:17></a> But the Lord began to speak to His

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have no doubt at all that Stephen understood these things; so that, being full of grace and power, as in the service, he is at once apprehended, as if the enemy would say, This cannot go on!<a name=284:3></a> He is arraigned before the council, and it is said that they saw his face "as the face of an angel".<a name=284:4></a> What a most delightful countenance!<a name=284:5></a> <i>They</i> saw it, but how must that face have appeared to heaven?<a name=284:6></a> At first they could not resist the wisdom and Spirit with which he spoke, but now his spirituality shines through his countenance, in the presence of those who hate him and who would finally put him to death.<a name=284:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another very precious thing about Stephen is that he was not only marked by spirituality, but by a very wide knowledge of the Holy Scriptures.<a name=284:8></a> You remember in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#12:12">Luke  12:12</a> that the Lord, encouraging His disciples, tells them they were not to be careful as to what they should say when brought before the synagogues, magistrates, and powers.<a name=284:9></a> He says, "for the Holy Spirit shall teach you in the hour itself what should be said".<a name=284:10></a> Now we have the thing exemplified in Stephen.<a name=284:11></a> He is full of grace, full of power, full of faith, full of the Holy Spirit, and he begins to speak.<a name=284:12></a> One has often been ashamed of one's little knowledge of Scripture, when reading this seventh chapter of the Acts of the Apostles.<a name=284:13></a> How few of us could give an impromptu <i>rsum</i> of the testimony, and the ways of God in it, as Stephen does here!<a name=284:14></a> He has no time to prepare his address,

		but he is taught in the same hour.<a name=285:1></a> He begins by speaking about the "God of glory", and says, He appeared to our father Abraham.<a name=285:2></a> There are no partial thoughts or feelings with Stephen, he would claim even those men sitting in the council as of Abraham.<a name=285:3></a> Then he speaks about eight others who were links in the chain of testimony Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Aaron, Joshua, David, and Solomon, showing what wonderful knowledge he had of the Holy Scriptures, how he must have read them.<a name=285:4></a>

		Referring to Peter, what is emphasised is the great need of patience.<a name=287:14></a> It is said of Peter that as he went up to Jerusalem those who were of the circumcision contended with him.<a name=287:15></a> Now we have an atmosphere of contention, and contention from those who did not understand.<a name=287:16></a> That is a very serious thing.<a name=287:17></a> If I do not understand I should at least seek not to contend.<a name=287:18></a> There are things in the way of ministry that one has not understood at times, but I am not called upon to contend in regard of that which I do not understand.<a name=287:19></a> Against what were these men contending?<a name=287:20></a> Consciously or unconsciously, it was against the operations of God, and of the Holy Spirit.<a name=287:21></a> Think of that!<a name=287:22></a> They contended with Peter.<a name=287:23></a> Does he assert his apostleship?<a name=287:24></a> Does he say the thing is so plain and apparent that I do not need to give an account of it?<a name=287:25></a> Not at all.<a name=287:26></a> The scripture says, "But Peter began and set forth the matter to them in

		Think of the kind of man that Peter was naturally.<a name=288:8></a> He had been an impulsive, forceful man; he had cut off the ear of the high priest's servant.<a name=288:9></a> As they came to Capernaum on one occasion, men came to Peter and said, "Does your teacher not pay the didrachmas?<a name=288:10></a>" And he said "Yes" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#17:24">Matthew  17:24</a>).<a name=288:11></a> Why should he reply for Jesus?<a name=288:12></a> Why not wait to ask his Lord about the tribute money?<a name=288:13></a> But the Lord, in His tender, ever patient, grace, anticipates Simon and says, "the kings of the earth, from whom do they receive custom or tribute?<a name=288:14></a> from their own sons or from strangers?<a name=288:15></a>" (verse 25).<a name=288:16></a> But, He says, "that we may not be an offence" (verse 27) -- that is the principle that Peter must learn.<a name=288:17></a> We are not to offend.<a name=288:18></a>

		Peter in this chapter is marked by great patience; a quality totally foreign to him on the line of nature; but having acquired great spirituality and patience, he "set forth the matter to them in order" -- not always an easy thing to do.<a name=288:19></a> The tendency is ever present with us to exhibit the irritability of the flesh in such matters, for impatience marks us naturally: instead of which the Lord would have

		Peter says, "I was in the city of Joppa praying", not preaching, nor being entertained by Simon the tanner; but the first thing in his mind was that he was in the city of Joppa praying, and he became "in an ecstasy".<a name=289:15></a> Our service as amongst the brethren, and even those that may contend because they fail to understand what is said, needs to be marked by this precious feature of patience.<a name=289:16></a> Peter stresses it; he says, "in your faith have also virtue .<a name=289:17></a>.<a name=289:18></a>.<a name=289:19></a> in temperance endurance" (<a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#1:5">2 Peter  1:5</a>, 6).<a name=289:20></a> He encourages the saints to be patient in relation to all that they are passing through.<a name=289:21></a>

		Isaiah dwells on these things, and he goes forward until finally he claims the whole gentile earth for this blessed Person.<a name=301:9></a> There is no prophet that has such a wide outlook as this son of the kingdom, Isaiah, and he suffered in view of the prophetic word, as we are reminded in chapter 20: 2, 3.<a name=301:10></a> He was a man of strong affections, a married man with two remarkable sons.<a name=301:11></a> It ought to be a matter of concern with all who have gift, and some commission and service from the Lord, that their household should be in entire support.<a name=301:12></a> Isaiah's household must have been one such.<a name=301:13></a> He calls his wife a prophetess, not that she had an official title, but because she was in full sympathy with his service.<a name=301:14></a> Then he had two sons, and they were remarkable lads; wherever they went they were signs to God's earthly people, they not only had distinctive names, but they had names which conveyed something, Maher-shalal-hash-baz and Shear-jashub.<a name=301:15></a> As people saw

		With Jeremiah it is different.<a name=302:3></a> He was a single man, he was to have neither wife nor children, (chapter 16), and yet he was a most loveable man.<a name=302:4></a> I question if there was any man in the Old Testament with such deep feelings as Jeremiah, he had most sensitive feelings, and I am going to speak of Jeremiah as a son in love.<a name=302:5></a> Jeremiah was loved before he was born.<a name=302:6></a> That is a very striking word, "Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I hallowed thee, I appointed thee a prophet unto the nations".<a name=302:7></a> A marvellous thing!<a name=302:8></a> Who knows what is in store for our children?<a name=302:9></a> Who could tell, as Jeremiah was born, what God had in mind for that child?<a name=302:10></a> "Before thou camest forth out of the womb I hallowed thee".<a name=302:11></a> What a vessel would he be!<a name=302:12></a> What filial fear would mark him, what subjection of heart and mind!<a name=302:13></a> He was nurtured and nourished in love, a son in love; and he begins to speak in answer to the commandment of Jehovah, and says, "Alas, Lord Jehovah!<a name=302:14></a> behold, I cannot speak; for I am a child".<a name=302:15></a> What a comely thing for a young man to say!<a name=302:16></a> I would encourage the young to serve and say, "I am a child".<a name=302:17></a> God will fill your mouth with words, as He did for Jeremiah.<a name=302:18></a> Jeremiah was not like Moses.<a name=302:19></a> Scripture records that he made excuse after excuse, until finally Jehovah was angry with him and said, "Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother?<a name=302:20></a> I know that he can speak well" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#4:14">Exodus  4:14</a>).<a name=302:21></a> It is not a question of your ability to

		When Jeremiah began to speak, he spoke about love, for he was a son in love, not the kind of love that would gloss over matters of unrighteousness.<a name=303:2></a> Divine love is never active at the expense of righteousness; it cannot be, for it would not be of God.<a name=303:3></a> Jeremiah at once speaks about love.<a name=303:4></a> He says, "I remember for thee the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals" (chapter 2: 2).<a name=303:5></a> If you speak in love you may have to suffer.<a name=303:6></a> Jeremiah is one of the great sufferers of the Old Testament, he is like Paul in relation to suffering, persecuted, vilified and misrepresented.<a name=303:7></a> What suffering and insult he had to bear!<a name=303:8></a> He was accounted worthy to die, to be smitten, insulted and ill-treated, and yet a man with the most refined sensibilities and spiritual feelings.<a name=303:9></a>

		We talk lightly about the weeping prophet, but he was a man of intense spiritual feeling, and he was with God.<a name=303:10></a> He bursts forth again in chapter 9: 1, "Oh that my head were waters, and mine eye a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night!<a name=303:11></a>" How little we shed tears in relation to the sorrows of the church.<a name=303:12></a> It was said of Joseph that when he saw Benjamin his brother, his mother's son, that he sought a place where he might weep.<a name=303:13></a> We speak of a drawing room, or dining room, perhaps, but do our houses contain a chamber where we may weep?<a name=303:14></a> Every lover of Christ ought to have a chamber where he or she might weep.<a name=303:15></a> Jeremiah desired to weep "day and night" (<a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#9:1">Jeremiah  9:1</a>).<a name=303:16></a> When God told him to weep, (chapter 14: 17), he was to weep "night and day", not day and night, and when Paul

	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe there were two answers, in the goodness of God to Jeremiah's weeping.<a name=304:3></a> One was Ezekiel and the other was Nehemiah.<a name=304:4></a> These two taken together show us the issue of Jeremiah's weeping.<a name=304:5></a> You may be sure that tears like that are put into God's bottle, and Ezekiel comes to light as an answer from God, and he sees visions of God.<a name=304:6></a> Nehemiah comes to light as an answer to Jeremiah's tears, and the very gates and walls that Jeremiah had sorrowed over, and wept over, were rebuilt by Nehemiah.<a name=304:7></a> If there are any weeping over church sorrows, I would commend to you the example and tears of Jeremiah.<a name=304:8></a> Be with God in your exercises and they cannot but be fruitful sooner or later.<a name=304:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now Ezekiel is a son of light.<a name=304:10></a> Ezekiel saw visions of God, and he was familiar with the divine glory.<a name=304:11></a> I do not want to lessen the blessedness of that, or minimise the importance of it.<a name=304:12></a> Ezekiel stands out in the Old Testament as a man who familiarised himself with the glory, and believers like that are few.<a name=304:13></a> He saw visions of God, he saw the Man in the glowing brass, and he watched the glory.<a name=304:14></a> He could tell you its exact whereabouts at any time, he knew just where the glory was, and he could tell you what few believers could tell you -- when and how it would return, and the basis upon which it would return, and what would characterise it when it returned.<a name=304:15></a> One of the most interesting features about the book of Ezekiel is this dwelling upon the glory.<a name=304:16></a> Ezekiel was familiar with it.<a name=304:17></a> I

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another thing that marks this son of light is that he has amazing courage in relation to the truth.<a name=305:3></a> He is undaunted, he has a forehead harder than flint, and he cannot be moved, yet his heart is tender; he is loveable and is marked by the deepest and most intense feelings.<a name=305:4></a> Ezekiel becomes a widower.<a name=305:5></a> It is remarkable what is said of these men -- one a family man, one without human ties, and one a widower.<a name=305:6></a> Ezekiel dearly loved his wife.<a name=305:7></a> Scripture speaks about her as the desire of his eyes.<a name=305:8></a> God says, "Behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke; yet thou shalt not mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down" (<a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#24:16">Ezekiel  24:16</a>).<a name=305:9></a> The prophetic testimony must not cease, there must be no surrender of the service on account of sorrow; the volume and power of the prophetic testimony must continue, therefore Ezekiel was not to weep.<a name=305:10></a> If ever Ezekiel was proved to be a man of God it was when he lost his wife.<a name=305:11></a> That is one of the most touching incidents in Scripture, that a man of such fine sensitive feelings, who loved his wife, the desire of his eyes, was not allowed to weep, as bereft.<a name=305:12></a> Oh, to be in the service of God with feelings and affections like that!<a name=305:13></a> -- showing that what is spiritual rises far above what is of nature, even though it be the sweetest divinely given relationship in nature.<a name=305:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Another feature about Ezekiel is his absolutely unswerving obedience to God.<a name=305:15></a> It is a rebuke to one.<a name=305:16></a> If he is told to take a barber's knife and shave his beard, and his head, he does it; not a complaint, nor a word about the

		I have in mind to say a word about influence, with special reference to spiritual influence amongst the people of God.<a name=309:1></a> We are told that none of us lives to himself, hence the consideration of this question brings home a definite challenge to each of our hearts, as to what kind of influence we wield.<a name=309:2></a> The thought of influence is brought before us early in the Scriptures, and I am referring now to material influences.<a name=309:3></a> We are told in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:16">Genesis  1:16</a> that God "made the two great lights, the great light to rule the day, and the small light to rule the night, -- and the stars", indicating doubtless that the earth was to be definitely influenced from heaven.<a name=309:4></a> So in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#136:8">Psalm  136:8</a>, 9 we have the appreciation on the part of God's earthly people of these two great influences; for the psalmist says, "The sun for rule over the day, for his loving-kindness endureth for ever.<a name=309:5></a> The moon and stars for rule over the night, for his loving-kindness endureth for ever" -- as if it were in the mind of God that men were to be responsive, as affected by these heavenly influences over the earth, and to answer in chorus, "His loving-kindness endureth for ever".<a name=309:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God did not confine Himself to material influences, for after He had made man, He gave him dominion -- or made him to rule -- "over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heavens, and over every animal that moveth on the earth" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:28">Genesis  1:28</a>), indicating that there should not

	<div class="paragraph">
		Later Adam failed, for he came under another influence, that of his wife.<a name=310:8></a> What an influence that may be either for good or evil!<a name=310:9></a> Scripture says, "a prudent wife is from Jehovah" (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#19:14">Proverbs  19:14</a>).<a name=310:10></a> One thinks of the wife of Manoah; what an advance she was on Eve!<a name=310:11></a> Eve held conversation with the serpent, losing the light and practical gain of the influence of headship, whereas the wife of Manoah would not converse even with an angel of God apart from her husband.<a name=310:12></a> She ran and told her husband, (<a href="../bible/Judges.htm#13:10">Judges  13:10</a>).<a name=310:13></a> What a delightful expression that is in contrast to what is current today.<a name=310:14></a> Then they prayed that the angel might come again a second time, and the word says, "And the Angel of God came again to the woman whilst she sat in the field" (verse 9).<a name=310:15></a> I wonder how many sisters find

	<div class="paragraph">
		The book of Judges corresponds to our own day, and I refer to that in passing, to show the kind of influence the wife of Manoah recognised, and what an asset she was to her husband.<a name=311:7></a> She says later, "If Jehovah were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt-offering and an oblation at our hands" (<a href="../bible/Judges.htm#13:23">Judges  13:23</a>).<a name=311:8></a> Is that the line of exercise with our sisters?<a name=311:9></a> -- occupation with Christ as the burnt-offering and the meat-offering, so that they are rendered pliable, and readily come under the influence of headship according to God.<a name=311:10></a> Well Eve failed, and Adam failed, but if so, we find that God raised up men of great spiritual influence later.<a name=311:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

		(6) THE DISSENSION OF PAUL AND BARNABAS
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is sorrowful to look upon dissension between two beloved servants of Christ, and to see them severed in their paths of service, which had previously been as one.<a name=359:2></a> But the Spirit has recorded that which took place between Paul and Barnabas, and has done so for our learning.<a name=359:3></a> Let us consider it with this in view, and free from the spirit of curiosity or criticism.<a name=359:4></a> I call attention to the source of the contention, so far as we can trace it, and the consequences flowing to each.<a name=359:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All that we have concerning Barnabas in the Acts previous to the dissension is very beautiful.<a name=359:6></a> His beginning was bright (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#4">Acts  4</a>) where in his wholeheartedness he received from the apostles the name of Barnabas, the son of consolation (or encouragement).<a name=359:7></a> Then not only was he regarded as a son of encouragement in the work at Jerusalem, but he became the link between that city and the work among the gentiles at Antioch.<a name=359:8></a> And rejoicing without jealousy in the grace of God to the gentiles, he encouraged them also to cleave with purpose of heart to the Lord.<a name=359:9></a> Then his links with Paul were close and sweet.<a name=359:10></a> He introduced him to the saints at Jerusalem when they were afraid of him, and afterwards was the means of introducing him to the saints, and the work of the Lord at Antioch.<a name=359:11></a> How suitable in every way it seemed that he should be chosen and called of the Holy Spirit to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But we are all tested, and the effect of the tests which are applied is to bring out to ourselves, and it may be to others, motives and weaknesses we did not suppose existed.<a name=360:3></a> If the motives are judged, and the weakness casts us upon the Lord, it is well.<a name=360:4></a> We have gained by the exposure.<a name=360:5></a> If otherwise, it is ill, for the motives which have been allowed sway us and turn us from the path.<a name=360:6></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This seems to be manifest in what follows.<a name=361:4></a> After they had returned from Jerusalem to Antioch, Peter came there, and having perfectly known the truth that God had received to blessing gentiles as gentiles, he ate with them, without any question or scruple.<a name=361:5></a> Then certain brethren came from James, and before them Peter separated himself from the gentile believers, to eat with the Jews only, thus distinctly recognising judaism as though it still had place with God.<a name=361:6></a> Now all this is spoken of by Paul by a strong term -- dissimulation, or hypocrisy, for, as he says, they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel.<a name=361:7></a> Peter knew better, but acted contrary to his knowledge.<a name=361:8></a> In this he was joined by all the Jews there, and even Barnabas, who should have stood in the truth pre-eminently, was carried away.<a name=361:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here, then, was the clear discovery of his weakness.<a name=361:10></a> Jerusalem, James, Peter, and the Jewish brethren, still had a place as such in his mind.<a name=361:11></a> In a word, he was not clear of the flesh in its religious prestige and glory.<a name=361:12></a> Well would it have been if he had accepted this exposure of his weakness, and, profiting by Paul's noble maintenance of the truth of the gospel, had sought humbly to walk according to it.<a name=361:13></a> But all that we have in <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2">Galatians  2</a>, throws light upon the dissension related in the end of <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#15">Acts  15</a>, and

	<div class="paragraph">
		A few words may suffice as to the consequences to each.<a name=362:8></a> As to Barnabas we read no more.<a name=362:9></a> It is as though he became of little account in the work of the Lord.<a name=362:10></a> He began early and brightly, and ran well, but here, alas, he drops out of view.<a name=362:11></a> To Paul, the severance from Barnabas seemed the breaking of the last link with Jerusalem, so that it is after this that we have what appears to be the most definite character of ministry and work.<a name=362:12></a> All his epistles were written after this time, in which we see set forth so clearly the worthlessness of the flesh, and that everything is found in Christ and in the Spirit.<a name=362:13></a> The lessons for us are evident.<a name=362:14></a> We may run well, but if the flesh is not judged, as it becomes exposed, it will eventually carry us away from the true path, and we may find ourselves severed from

		When man was first formed he was placed on earth in responsibility to God, and this was signified by the commandment which he received concerning the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.<a name=367:3></a> Man's sin, which so quickly followed, was failure in responsibility; and not only so, but the principle of sin finding a place in him, the fulfilment of his responsibility was rendered difficult, for he had entered upon the path of self-will, in which he sought his own pleasure, in the neglect of God's will.<a name=367:4></a>
