		It is the desire of God to have lovers.<a name=1:1></a> The apostle Paul speaks of those who love God.<a name=1:2></a> God's desire to have such is so great that He commands it, saying, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#22:37">Matthew  22:37</a>).<a name=1:3></a> It is imperative according to the divine standard, and He wants thousands to love Him.<a name=1:4></a> Scripture speaks of "ten thousands of ten thousands and thousands of thousands" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#5:11">Revelation  5:11</a>).<a name=1:5></a> Daniel tells us that "thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him" (<a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#7:10">Daniel  7:10</a>).<a name=1:6></a> It is a wonderful suggestion when God speaks of the "thousands of them that love me" (<a href="../bible/Deuteronomy.htm#5:10">Deuteronomy  5:10</a>).<a name=1:7></a>

		God wants lovers who will love Him with all their heart, all their soul, all their strength, and all their mind.<a name=1:8></a> He is not content with fragments, with the tail end of our lives, with a few odd moments on our knees at bedtime.<a name=1:9></a> He wants no movement in the heart except what is of Himself, no desire apart from Him, no strength wasted, no thought of which He is not the Object.<a name=1:10></a> God is so blessed, so worthy, He is to have it all and He wants thousands of thousands like that.<a name=1:11></a> Behind all this lies the heart of God, and He has made Himself known in such a way that He will absorb the whole being of so many.<a name=1:12></a> It was the desires of love on the part of God that led to this command for

		In contrast, think of those who hate God; those of whom the Lord said, "now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#15:24">John  15:24</a>).<a name=2:2></a> Awful contemplation!<a name=2:3></a> that the human heart should be so alienated from God, that it should forget and hate Him.<a name=2:4></a> What a range of things fills the hearts of men in the last days, as <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#3">2 Timothy  3</a>tells us -- anything except God.<a name=2:5></a> Men love even themselves.<a name=2:6></a> We live in the most selfish day in history.<a name=2:7></a> In every sphere, self is enthroned.<a name=2:8></a> What man loves rules him.<a name=2:9></a> What controls the heart controls the being.<a name=2:10></a> Thus everything gives place to what ministers to self.<a name=2:11></a> There are also lovers of money; it has taken God's place.<a name=2:12></a> How we see it all around with its accompanying sorrows, which pierce men and drown them in perdition.<a name=2:13></a> Then, lovers of pleasure -- how many devotees at that altar!<a name=2:14></a> We see everything sacrificed to it.<a name=2:15></a> There are those also who love and make a lie.<a name=2:16></a> If men did not love a lie, the bookshops would soon be closed.<a name=2:17></a> The same is found in the religious world.<a name=2:18></a> At bottom, men know it is all a lie, but they love it because it is a lie; indeed, the whole world is a lie, a sham, but men love it.<a name=2:19></a> Again we see how pre-eminence is loved by men, and the love of it will lead them to anything.<a name=2:20></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The divine thought is "lovers of <i>God</i>".<a name=2:21></a> How this is exemplified in Christ!<a name=2:22></a> Not one affection stirred His heart but God was its centre.<a name=2:23></a> From Bethlehem to Calvary, God was the object of His every desire.<a name=2:24></a> "I have spent my strength" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#49:4">Isaiah  49:4</a>), He could say.<a name=2:25></a> It was used to serve God.<a name=2:26></a> Though weary He would continue His journey to find one worshipper.<a name=2:27></a> His strength was weakened in the

		way, the way to Calvary.<a name=3:1></a> Not a thought, but God was its object; as it is written of Him, "Oh how I love thy law!<a name=3:2></a> it is my meditation all the day" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#119:97">Psalm  119:97</a>).<a name=3:3></a> Every morning, His ear was opened to hear, as the instructed.<a name=3:4></a> We see in Him the perfect model of a lover of God.<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we may see what God is prepared to do for His lovers.<a name=3:6></a> What gain there is in this, what blessedness!<a name=3:7></a> "If any one love God, <i>he</i> is known of him".<a name=3:8></a> God knows such a one altogether.<a name=3:9></a> He knew Christ, that great Lover.<a name=3:10></a> He was unknown among men, but well-known in heaven.<a name=3:11></a> Only heaven, and a few in touch with heaven, knew of His birth.<a name=3:12></a> Then those thirty years -- who knows of that secret life in Egypt, at Nazareth, hidden from the world!<a name=3:13></a> None of us knows much about it; God knew it all.<a name=3:14></a> At the end of it He could say, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#3:17">Matthew  3:17</a>).<a name=3:15></a> That was a review of those thirty years.<a name=3:16></a> Every prayer, every action, every step, every thought had been watched.<a name=3:17></a> It came out at His baptism, He was known of God.<a name=3:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So it is with all God's lovers.<a name=3:19></a> Of course in one sense He knows everybody.<a name=3:20></a> He knows every fowl on the mountains; not one sparrow falls to the ground without His knowledge.<a name=3:21></a> He knows the wicked afar off.<a name=3:22></a> But this passage means that He knows him intimately.<a name=3:23></a> We see this in Abraham, the friend of God.<a name=3:24></a> A friend loves at all times, be they dark or bright; whether in plenty or in little.<a name=3:25></a> Abraham is called the friend of God.<a name=3:26></a> And God says, "I know him" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#18:19">Genesis  18:19</a>), and further, "walk before my face" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#17:1">Genesis  17:1</a>); so that God could look at him as he walked.<a name=3:27></a> The preposition is "<i>before</i>", not '<i>with</i>'.<a name=3:28></a> God would have it thus with every lover of His.<a name=3:29></a> He would give each

		one the sense that He knows them favourably and intimately.<a name=4:1></a> Better to be known of God than of the world.<a name=4:2></a> It is a poor thing to be known by the king, compared to what it is to be known of God.<a name=4:3></a> Again, the scripture says, "Jehovah spoke with Moses face to face, as a man speaks with his friend" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#33:11">Exodus  33:11</a>).<a name=4:4></a> The basis of that is that Moses was a lover of God.<a name=4:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What will God not do for those who love Him?<a name=4:6></a> Jesus loved Lazarus and He would go to the place where they were prepared to stone Him for Lazarus' sake.<a name=4:7></a> <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>helps here.<a name=4:8></a> We <i>do not</i> know what to pray for as is fitting, but we <i>do</i> know that all things work together for good to those that love God.<a name=4:9></a> He has such an interest in His lovers that He uses all His power, His wisdom and His riches to make all things work together for good to those who love Him; not for everybody, but for His lovers.<a name=4:10></a> Note the word <i>together</i>, that is, these things are made to co-ordinate, so that everything that may come upon His lovers will work for good.<a name=4:11></a> This is seen in the pathway of Jesus.<a name=4:12></a> God was behind all His movements, as we may see in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#7">Luke  7</a>.<a name=4:13></a> If He goes to the house of a proud Pharisee, God caused that one should come in there who did not cease to kiss His feet.<a name=4:14></a> Calvary is the great expression of the love of God, and that He is behind everything to bring good out of it.<a name=4:15></a> Through it there will be brought to light the myriads of the redeemed who all love God.<a name=4:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So it will be with us in the measure we love God.<a name=4:17></a> Whatever may come upon us -- sickness, difficulties in circumstances, unjust accusations or trials, God is so great that if we love Him He will cause any or all of these things to work together for our good.<a name=4:18></a> Lovers of God do not think

		these things are against them.<a name=5:1></a> Our great concern is not merely to recover our health, not to overcome the difficulties, not to prove we have been unjustly accused; but to see to it that we love God, and then we can confidently leave all these matters in His hand.<a name=5:2></a> "We <i>do</i> know that all things work together" etc.<a name=5:3></a> We may and do have many solemn exercises about many things, but the greater exercise is to love God, and that means that no room is left in the heart for any idol.<a name=5:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle Paul in writing to the Corinthians says, "Things which eye has not seen, and ear not heard, and which have not come into man's heart, which God has prepared for them that love him".<a name=5:5></a> They have such a place in His heart, He values them so much, that He has prepared them.<a name=5:6></a> There has been deliberate activity, there is a plan and a process to prepare for God's lovers what the human heart could never dream of.<a name=5:7></a> There is a place prepared for such in the Father's house.<a name=5:8></a> Wonderful thought!<a name=5:9></a> in a sphere where only love prevails; where there is conscious relationship.<a name=5:10></a> The city too is prepared for them, the city that Abraham looked for, whose Builder and Maker is God.<a name=5:11></a> "He has prepared for them a city" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:16">Hebrews  11:16</a>).<a name=5:12></a> What a city!<a name=5:13></a> God's city has only one street, a golden street.<a name=5:14></a> There is no false step; every movement is transparent, no dark underhand movements.<a name=5:15></a> It has a wonderful temple.<a name=5:16></a> God and the Lamb are that temple.<a name=5:17></a> There is no need of the sun, for the glory of God is the light, and the Lamb is the lamp thereof, and a river of water of life, clear as crystal, flows out of the throne.<a name=5:18></a> We belong to that city, for our citizenship is in heaven.<a name=5:19></a> This is but one of the things that God has prepared, and He would give us to enjoy it now.<a name=5:20></a>

		Indeed according to <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:22">Hebrews  12:22</a> we have come to it now, the "city of the living God".<a name=6:1></a>

		What is this love for God?<a name=6:9></a> How is it expressed?<a name=6:10></a> There are people who say they will not believe unless they see.<a name=6:11></a> But nobody has ever seen love, it is a spiritual thing, yet nobody can deny that love exists.<a name=6:12></a> And where love is, it is expressed.<a name=6:13></a> Now love for God is expressed in a twofold way, by obedience and by sacrifice.<a name=6:14></a> These two great expressions of love are seen pre-eminently in Christ; in Him they shine.<a name=6:15></a> He was obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.<a name=6:16></a> Then His love found expression in sacrifice; how great the sacrifice of Himself!<a name=6:17></a> Now what good is there for us to say we love God if we do not obey Him?<a name=6:18></a> "Hereby know we that we love the children of God, when we love God and keep his commandments" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:2">1 John  5:2</a>).<a name=6:19></a> Love enjoins and love obeys.<a name=6:20></a> "Children, let us not love with word, nor with tongue, but in deed and in truth" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:18">1 John  3:18</a>).<a name=6:21></a> So that the great expression of love in a believer is that he is subject.<a name=6:22></a>

		Let us see to it then that we are not lovers of self, of pleasure, of money, but lovers of God, so that we may taste the sweetness of these things, and let us all join in saying, "<i>We</i> love because <i>he</i> has first loved us" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:19">1 John  4:19</a>).<a name=7:22></a>

		My desire tonight, dear brethren, is to speak of liberty in the service of God, and I think this liberty is largely bound up with three things.<a name=81:2></a> The first is an understanding of <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#8">Leviticus  8</a>, that is, an understanding of sanctification -- "He that sanctifies and those sanctified are all of one".<a name=81:3></a> I believe that lies at the basis of any liberty as serving God in His own presence.<a name=81:4></a> That is connected with the service of the Mediator.<a name=81:5></a> It was carried out by Moses in <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#8">Leviticus  8</a>-- "Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying .<a name=81:6></a>.<a name=81:7></a>.<a name=81:8></a>".<a name=81:9></a> The Sanctifier is the Lord Jesus as Mediator.<a name=81:10></a> But then the Lord brings in what is additionally necessary in <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>; there is that which His own service has effected, which He speaks of as "He that is washed all over".<a name=81:11></a> There is also the service of love that is left for us to do for each other in washing one another's feet.<a name=81:12></a> We have been washed all over -- Moses took Aaron and his sons and washed them with water, they were washed all over.<a name=81:13></a> He that is washed all over still needs to wash his feet and that is a service of love left to us to perform for each other.<a name=81:14></a> Then finally, what is needed also is the attitude that is referred to in <a href="../bible/2Chronicles.htm#5:12">2 Chronicles  5:12</a>, where it says that the priests and the Levites were standing at the east end of the altar.<a name=81:15></a> They were standing as holding

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To return for a moment to <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#8">Leviticus  8</a>; I believe that is a matter all the people of God need grounding in -- sanctification.<a name=82:3></a> Before I speak of it in detail, it will be well to say a few words on the service of God generally, and you will understand that what I mean now is the service of God as in Leviticus, that is priestly service.<a name=82:4></a> In Numbers it is levitical service; in Leviticus it is serving God in His presence.<a name=82:5></a> The service of God has two parts to it; there is the service of God at the altar and the service inside the tabernacle.<a name=82:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Priestly service at the altar was a public matter; that is anyone could have come along and could have seen the priests serving at the altar; but inside the tabernacle no one saw what went on, only the priests themselves knew.<a name=82:7></a> Typically, they entered into a scene where all was of God.<a name=82:8></a> And you will find in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#29">Exodus  29</a>and 30 that those two sides of the service went on every morning and every evening; every morning the priests went to the brazen altar and offered the morning lamb, and every evening the evening lamb, with its meat-offering and drink-offering.<a name=82:9></a> But then the priest also went inside the tabernacle every morning and evening, and he trimmed the lamp and put incense on the golden altar.<a name=82:10></a> You can understand that when a priest went inside and looked around, as entering in spirit a scene where everything was of God, what kind of prayers and praise would go up from him at the golden

		To take up priestly service at all we need to know something of sanctification, but what I have in mind to occupy us with tonight is the service of God in connection with the morning meeting, the Lord's supper.<a name=83:10></a> I believe that this matter of sanctification according to <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#8">Leviticus  8</a>has an important bearing in connection with the cup.<a name=83:11></a> We have been occupied this afternoon with the truth of reconciliation.<a name=83:12></a> Now reconciliation refers to the way Christ has laid the basis in divine righteousness for this scene where everything is of God.<a name=83:13></a> Reconciliation does not only bear on the church, but on all things in heaven and in earth.<a name=83:14></a> "You .<a name=83:15></a>.<a name=83:16></a>.<a name=83:17></a> now has it reconciled" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:21">Colossians  1:21</a>, 22).<a name=83:18></a> But reconciliation touches the whole scene of glory.<a name=83:19></a> We should be in liberty at all times in our spirits to enter into the immediate presence of God, without embarrassment, as a matter of enjoyment and contemplation.<a name=83:20></a> <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15">Luke  15</a>is a matter of enjoyment, <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#9">Hebrews  9</a>and 10 a matter of

	<div class="paragraph">
		<i>Sanctification</i> refers especially to the bearing of the work of Christ <i>on the church</i>.<a name=84:8></a> It is not so much what the work of Christ has done for God in its vast and extensive character, but what the work of Christ has done for us <i>in making us all of one with Him</i>.<a name=84:9></a> If we are actively to serve God in His own immediate presence, we need to have a sense that we <i>have part</i> with Christ, as entirely suitable, as all of one with Him.<a name=84:10></a> Many companies will come into the meaning of reconciliation, heavenly and earthly companies, but no company will come into sanctification like the church.<a name=84:11></a> They will have part in the universe of bliss, but no company will have part with Christ in the holy service of God like the assembly.<a name=84:12></a> What the Lord had before Him in a special way in going into death was that He should sanctify us by the offering of His body once for all, to bring us in as a priestly company with Himself in

		Let us look for a moment at this chapter to see some of the important things in it.<a name=86:3></a> It says in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:11">Hebrews  2:11</a> that "he that sanctifies and those sanctified are all of one".<a name=86:4></a> That is, the saints are entirely identified with Christ as a Man in the immediate presence of God.<a name=86:5></a> How has that been brought about?<a name=86:6></a> By Christ's wonderful service to us as the Mediator by the offering of His body once for all, typified in <i>the sin-offering, the burnt-offering and the ram of consecration</i>.<a name=86:7></a> So what has happened is that, through the work of God to begin with, every one of us has a link with Christ through His service towards us as Mediator.<a name=86:8></a> We have all been washed all over.<a name=86:9></a> You say, why did Aaron need washing all over?<a name=86:10></a> -- Aaron is a type of Christ.<a name=86:11></a> The Lord said "I sanctify myself for them" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#17:19">John  17:19</a>).<a name=86:12></a> The Lord Himself has left flesh and blood conditions <i>for our sakes</i>.<a name=86:13></a> He need not have done, but He Himself has gone through the waters of death.<a name=86:14></a> His position as Man before God is based on the fact that He died and has risen again; He did it for our <i>sakes</i>.<a name=86:15></a> <i>Aaron and his sons</i> were washed all over -- we are brought before God on the ground of death.<a name=86:16></a> That is the very same ground on which Jesus is before Him, for our sakes, that we might be brought with Him before God.<a name=86:17></a> The precious ministry of the Mediator as to His death has this practical effect of washing us all over.<a name=86:18></a> The Lord says in <a href="../bible/John.htm#13:10">John  13:10</a>, "He that is washed all over .<a name=86:19></a>.<a name=86:20></a>.<a name=86:21></a>".<a name=86:22></a> The word of God, through the Mediator, through Christ, has come home in power to the soul, giving me a sense of a link with Him beyond death.<a name=86:23></a>

		And then to go forward -- <i>Aaron and his sons were</i> all clothed; Aaron in his special garments -- Christ is unique in that -- but the sons also were clothed.<a name=87:1></a> The part I want to dwell on most is that <i>Aaron and his sons</i> put their hands on the head of the sin-offering; they put their hands on the head of the burnt-offering, and on the head of the ram of consecration.<a name=87:2></a> Following on that, Aaron and his sons had the blood put on the right thumb, the right ear and the right toe, and Aaron and his sons had their hands filled with what was delightful to God.<a name=87:3></a> Aaron and his sons were anointed and were sprinkled with blood.<a name=87:4></a> Thus the sanctifier and those that were sanctified were all of one, brought before God on sacrificial ground as all of one.<a name=87:5></a> I believe that to have that in our souls is going to set us free in the presence of God.<a name=87:6></a> It is involved in the cup and the covenant because it is the work of the Mediator.<a name=87:7></a> We come into the presence of God conscious that the Sanctifier has made us all of one with Himself.<a name=87:8></a> It is man going in to God -- not God coming out to man -- on the same ground before God as Christ is as Man.<a name=87:9></a> How marvellous the grace of Christ, that He is now before God on the ground of a sin-offering having been offered!<a name=87:10></a> Aaron and his sons put their hands on it -- we are identified with Christ before God on the basis of that offering.<a name=87:11></a> He is there on the basis of that offering, not because He needed it, but in grace, that we might be one with Him on that ground; the burnt-offering similarly, and the ram of consecration.<a name=87:12></a> It is especially calculated to set us free.<a name=87:13></a> The sin-offering has dealt with all that is offensive and put it away; the burnt-offering is the sweet odour of Christ to God in which we are accepted.<a name=87:14></a> But the ram of consecration is a touching reference to the

		The details of what was put into their hands speak wonderfully of the perfection of Christ in that precious sacrifice and of His precious manhood.<a name=88:5></a> He would fill our hands with these things.<a name=88:6></a> How could brethren be silent if their hands were filled with these things?<a name=88:7></a> And they were all anointed; so that in every way "he that sanctifies and those sanctified are all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren".<a name=88:8></a> I believe that has a very important bearing on what we may speak of as <i>the transition</i> at the Supper from what God and Christ are to us, to what we are to God as having part with Christ in the service of God.<a name=88:9></a>

		When it comes to the practical working out of it, <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>helps.<a name=88:10></a> Once the priests were sanctified, when they were washed all over, they were never washed all over again, but every time they approached to serve God they had to wash their hands and feet at the laver.<a name=88:11></a> We cannot wash one another's hands -- that is a matter which we have to see to ourselves: "Let a man prove himself, and thus eat of the bread" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:28">1 Corinthians  11:28</a>).<a name=88:12></a> We have to see that we have holy hands.<a name=88:13></a> But when it comes to a question of feet washing, in <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>, the Lord leaves that as a service of love which we

	<div class="paragraph">
		That brings us to Chronicles, which I think illustrates the normal service of the Supper.<a name=91:7></a> This is the service of the sanctuary.<a name=91:8></a> When it is acting normally, feet washing has taken place; everyone set free and everything going forward in liberty in the holy service of God.<a name=91:9></a> What it says in verse 11 is that all the priests present were hallowed without observing the courses.<a name=91:10></a> I have heard brothers say the priests should serve by course.<a name=91:11></a> So they should in certain aspects, <i>but not at the Supper</i>.<a name=91:12></a> All the priests present were hallowed; that is the normal thing, every priest is free.<a name=91:13></a> That is how we should hold ourselves at the Supper, all sanctified, all holding in faith the ground of <a href="../bible/Leviticus.htm#8">Leviticus  8</a>and ready for the service.<a name=91:14></a> All the priests were hallowed without observing the courses -- they were all ready to take up the service of God.<a name=91:15></a> "The Levites the singers .<a name=91:16></a>.<a name=91:17></a>.<a name=91:18></a> clad in byssus, with cymbals and lutes and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them a hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets".<a name=91:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What I desire to speak to you about, dear brethren, is the thought of <i>completeness</i>.<a name=115:1></a> To the assembly at Sardis, the Lord said, "I have not found thy works complete before my God" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:2">Revelation  3:2</a>).<a name=115:2></a> Our desire is that the Lord may search all our hearts in relation to whether there has been <i>completion</i> in regard to our assembly exercises.<a name=115:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the epistle to the Colossians the Spirit of God brings out this thought of completeness; first, in relation to the word of God, we are told that the truth of the mystery was the completion of the whole circle of divine revelation (chapter 1: 25).<a name=115:4></a> Then, after the Lord Jesus is presented as the glorious Head of His assembly, it is said of the saints, "ye are complete in him, who is the head of all principality and authority" (chapter 2: 10).<a name=115:5></a> What a thought that is!<a name=115:6></a> We have not to travel outside the Lord Jesus for anything that the assembly needs.<a name=115:7></a> All that ever was needed since the day of Pentecost, no matter what the difficulty, has been found in "him, who is the head of all principality and authority".<a name=115:8></a> Then in chapter 4: 12, we read of Epaphras, whose priestly intercession, labouring day and night in prayers for the saints at Colosse, was to the end that they might stand "perfect and complete in all the will of God".<a name=115:9></a> What a valuable service anyone would render to the saints today, as labouring fervently in prayers to bring them into the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If we look abroad in christendom today, and think of all that has come in in the public history of the assembly, we see how far short we have fallen from the complete will of God.<a name=116:3></a> The first necessity for recovery is that we take up things in personal exercise before God, so that they might be completed.<a name=116:4></a> In Enoch, the seventh from Adam, we have the complete course of spiritual education.<a name=116:5></a> David was never morally or spiritually greater than when he brought up the ark.<a name=116:6></a> This had been the great desire of his heart as a shepherd lad, and he was allowed by God to complete it, as bringing the ark into the tent which he had provided.<a name=116:7></a> In that day he delivered a psalm into the hands of Asaph and his brethren.<a name=116:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the final thought in Colossians is seen in Archippus (chapter 4: 17).<a name=116:9></a> The beloved apostle sent him this word, which comes home to every one that has taken up the work of the ministry: "And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, to the end that thou fulfil it".<a name=116:10></a> We feel the immense importance of this, lest we should stop short of the complete will of God.<a name=116:11></a> How much there is of going half way -- how many have never been fully committed to the Lord and the circle of His interests!<a name=116:12></a> What a perilous position they are in!<a name=116:13></a>

		H.F.<a name=193:1></a>N.<a name=193:2></a> What is before me in suggesting these scriptures is the importance that the Spirit of God attaches to authority.<a name=193:3></a> We would all recognise that one of the peculiar dangers of the present moment is the spirit of lawlessness and democracy, leading to the overthrow of authority.<a name=193:4></a> These scriptures would impress upon the hearts of all, not only of those who have had experience in the ways of God, and who care for the interests of the Lord in this city, but also of the very youngest in this company, that the security and continuance of what we all value hangs on our recognition of authority.<a name=193:5></a> We might look at it first, in relation to the Lord Himself.<a name=193:6></a> In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#14">Romans  14</a>He is presented to us as Lord both of the dead and living.<a name=193:7></a> Then in <a href="../bible/John.htm#5">John  5</a>the Father has given all authority into His hands, and, as the Son of man, authority to execute judgment is also committed to Him.<a name=193:8></a> Peter said, "Who is at the right hand of God, gone into heaven, angels and authorities and powers being subjected to him" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#3:22">1 Peter  3:22</a>).<a name=193:9></a> Every writer in the New Testament emphasises that unlimited authority has been placed in the hands of the Lord Jesus.<a name=193:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The second thought is the authority of the apostles.<a name=193:11></a> We read in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4">Ephesians  4</a>, "He that descended is the same who has also ascended up above all the heavens, that he might fill all things; and <i>he</i> has given some apostles".<a name=193:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, in relation to the assembly, authority is seen in four ways.<a name=194:3></a> First, as set forth in <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#4">Proverbs  4</a>, we have parental authority; for in the assembly the basis is the recognition of authority as bound up with what is parental.<a name=194:4></a> Authority is in the house of God, but the holy blend of love is seen connected with it.<a name=194:5></a> In <a href="../bible/Joshua.htm#1">Joshua  1</a>, we see in Moses ministerial authority.<a name=194:6></a> He was the great minister raised up of God, and God put authority into his hands.<a name=194:7></a> Then in relation to Eleazar, we have in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#4:16">Numbers  4:16</a> priestly control in authority.<a name=194:8></a> The seven things of which he was to have charge would indicate his control of all the services that stood in relation to the house of God.<a name=194:9></a> And, finally, upon Joshua God conferred authority connected typically with the spiritual realm.<a name=194:10></a> So we have in the assembly these four kinds of authority; first, what is parental; secondly, what is ministerial; thirdly, what is priestly; and fourthly, what is spiritual -- though in the spiritual realm what is authoritative does not come so much into evidence.<a name=194:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the last scripture we have a very wide thought.<a name=194:12></a> When the Lord was going away He gave authority into the hands of His servants: "having .<a name=194:13></a>.<a name=194:14></a>.<a name=194:15></a> given to his bondmen the authority".<a name=194:16></a> Then in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#21">Matthew  21</a>the Lord is challenged as to His authority, and He met the challenge by referring to a fixed principle; that is, whether the ministry was of heaven or of men.<a name=194:17></a> Its origin determines the authority.<a name=194:18></a>

		This afternoon we were speaking together about the advantages and the disadvantages of the present moment.<a name=289:1></a> The disadvantage, if we may so speak, of being connected with the testimony of the Lord, is that it offers no return or compensation in this present world.<a name=289:2></a> The whole outlook as regards the present world is that your connections with christianity, as presented in the holy writings, will mean that your position places you at a disadvantage as regards this world, for the world has nothing to offer you but a grave.<a name=289:3></a> That is how the matter stood in relation to the Lord Jesus as here in this world.<a name=289:4></a> Now that He has gone out of this world, and has gone to the right hand of God, sending the Holy Spirit down here to continue all that which was introduced in Himself, there is a divinely constituted vessel in this scene in which are now continued the days of His suffering and reproach.<a name=289:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		That is how we are placed as regards this world; that is one side of the truth.<a name=289:6></a> But I wish to show you how evident it is that, notwithstanding all this, we are connected with the wealthiest order of things that could be conceived.<a name=289:7></a> Christianity is not a bankrupt concern; it has undiminished resources, despite the scene in which it is, and we are entitled to take account of it from that point of view.<a name=289:8></a> With this in mind I have grouped these scriptures,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Matthew is a gospel which speaks much of the Lord Jesus in relation to His regal position.<a name=290:3></a> He comes into this world as the Son of David with legal title to the kingdom, and His coming in at once agitates the hostile world, and stirs up the murderous spirit which is there.<a name=290:4></a> If we follow Him in Matthew's gospel we shall see that from His baptism, when the Holy Spirit came down from heaven and publicly committed God to that Man, the One who was the vessel of power here, anointed as Jehovah's King, anointed by heaven.<a name=290:5></a> The great thought underlying the Lord's movements in Matthew is that of power.<a name=290:6></a> In Jesus' movements amongst men, dealing with every kind of disease, healing all that were oppressed by the devil, we see that which indicated the great power of God, the power of the world to come, present in a Man here.<a name=290:7></a> He dealt with all kinds of cases, baffling cases, hopeless cases.<a name=290:8></a> He deals successfully, perfectly, with every case that is submitted to Him, demonstrating the great power that was present in Him, for He dealt with death itself, breaking its power.<a name=290:9></a> Even death had to give way before the power of Christ in a world of hostility dominated by the power of Satan.<a name=290:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As the people saw Him administering the bounty of God, and saw Him putting into motion the power of heaven in regard to the many cases dealt with, it is understandable how they "glorified God who gave such power to men".<a name=290:11></a> Jesus was here exercising the power of

		<a name=291>[Page 291]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God.<a name=291:1></a> He was not wielding that power in a destructive way, He was here representing all the power and authority of heaven, but in favour of men.<a name=291:2></a> And Jesus as He moved from circumstance to circumstance in His passage through this scene, emphasised in every case He handled, that He was dealing with things here morally, and bringing the power of the world to come to bear upon the situation.<a name=291:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At the end of this gospel He is seen as the great Vessel of power, all power being in His hands.<a name=291:4></a> The whole domain is under Him, and that power is to fill the whole universe publicly; that great power is at the disposal of everyone here.<a name=291:5></a> I would like the youngest believer to understand, that in making your choice to follow Christ, you are following the great Vessel of power, and His power is at your disposal in regard to any difficulty, or danger, which you may have to confront.<a name=291:6></a> You may be tested by things which you find in you, the power actuated by the devil touching the flesh in you.<a name=291:7></a> But there is a power far greater than that, and the Vessel of divine power is at your disposal, so that you may not fall under the power of the enemy, so that you may not fall under the power of the world.<a name=291:8></a> The world, with all its glitter and glamour is constantly inviting you, it would take you along its paths, those paths of glory which lead but to the grave.<a name=291:9></a> But the Vessel of divine power would be near you ready to throw all that power into the fray, and it is greater than any hostile power you may meet here.<a name=291:10></a> "Greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:4">1 John  4:4</a>).<a name=291:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would encourage the youngest believer as going through a world, where you are meeting the power of the enemy in its various forms, to turn to Jesus the One in

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we come to Mark's gospel which presents Jesus from another standpoint, and introduces Him almost abruptly, not like Matthew who would go to great pains to establish His legal right to the throne.<a name=292:8></a> Mark would bring Jesus in as the great Vessel of service, and would introduce Him in His service.<a name=292:9></a> It is not a question of going over His past and showing you the line along which He has come into this world.<a name=292:10></a> It is a question now of qualifications, and therefore the Servant is immediately ushered into His service.<a name=292:11></a> Mark has great delight in retracing the service of Jesus here, for Mark would call attention to the way in which He served, the way in which He did things, taking account of the most minute detail in connection with the Lord's service, for the service was <i>exacting</i>.<a name=292:12></a> There were long, long days of service, in which He was oftentimes weary; you may even see Him sleeping with a pillow under His head after much service.<a name=292:13></a> But the days were very full days in the life of Jesus, as He served in the most unselfish manner.<a name=292:14></a> His service was rendered so freely, so ungrudgingly.<a name=292:15></a> No one who made a demand upon Him would be made to feel that he was breaking into His

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the great Vessel of service is seen by Mark, who records the feelings of the people in regard to how He did things, for as astonishment filled their hearts, they recorded this great fact that Jesus did all things well.<a name=293:3></a> He had done everything well; everything that He did, He did perfectly, and it could never be improved upon.<a name=293:4></a> Had it been required to render that great service again it could not be improved upon.<a name=293:5></a> That is how the great Vessel of service carried on day by day, and Mark would give us some beautiful touches in connection with the Lord's service.<a name=293:6></a> He would call attention to the fact that He takes a blind man by the hand, and leads him out of the crowd and puts His hand, His fingers, upon his eyes.<a name=293:7></a> What a touch, what a service, what an impression it must have conveyed to that blind man to feel the hand of Jesus, the fingers of Jesus upon his eyes!<a name=293:8></a> The Vessel of service come down from heaven, here amongst men, served all who put in their claim for service.<a name=293:9></a> He would serve in a most impartial way, and He would touch, as if identifying Himself voluntarily with what there was in the way of disability.<a name=293:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then you remember the deaf man, how the Lord puts His fingers into the ears of that man; what an impression, what a feeling!<a name=293:11></a> How his heart must have been stirred with deep emotion to feel the fingers of Jesus touching his ears, opening them!<a name=293:12></a> What a wonderful service was that of the Lord Jesus!<a name=293:13></a> I wish to convey to those who are young that,

		To come to Luke's gospel, we find that Luke gives us still another presentation of Jesus.<a name=294:6></a> Luke himself had a very exact knowledge of what Jesus did and what He said here.<a name=294:7></a> Indeed he speaks in the opening of the Acts of "all things which Jesus began both to do and to teach".<a name=294:8></a> Luke, in writing this gospel, does so with method, and he draws up a relation of the facts, setting them out in order and making every circumstance lend itself to the distinctiveness of the grace of God as seen in Jesus.<a name=294:9></a> For He is presented by Luke as the great Vessel of grace, moving in and out amongst men in this scene, constantly dispensing the grace of heaven.<a name=294:10></a> How delightful to think of Jesus here in the days of His flesh as presented by Luke in His perfect humanity, touching humanity at this point, coming into this world as a Babe and growing up.<a name=294:11></a> We see Him as a Child of twelve years of age in all that was comely and proper to the occasion when in the midst of the doctors.<a name=294:12></a> And then reaching full manhood standing as a young Man in all the vigour of life on the banks of the Jordan, the Holy Spirit coming down like a dove, and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As we trace Him in His pathway here, every step was full of grace, and as we observe Him in His goings, how beautiful they were!<a name=295:2></a> Think of a Man in a hostile world like this, surrounded by everything that was unholy, but being uncontaminated by anything that belongs to this world!<a name=295:3></a> As we hear Him speak He does so with such grace, for He stood up in the synagogue to read the holy writings as was His custom.<a name=295:4></a> And as He selected a passage and read, we observe that in order to make this scripture conform to the dispensation, He gave it a new punctuation; closing the book at "the acceptable year of the Lord", showing how the Lord Jesus was in this world as the Vessel of grace.<a name=295:5></a> They "wondered at the words of grace which were coming out of his mouth".<a name=295:6></a> All the words of Jesus were full of grace.<a name=295:7></a> But Luke would throw into high relief Jesus as the Vessel of grace.<a name=295:8></a> Everything He did and said was in absolute harmony with the grace of heaven, to put it in Luke's words, "All things which Jesus began both to do and to teach".<a name=295:9></a> Everything He did and everything He said would agree at any point, there was no disparity in what Jesus did and what He said.<a name=295:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The words of grace came out of His mouth, and there was nothing in His pathway here to contradict that.<a name=295:11></a> So Luke would follow the ways of Jesus in grace that we might know Him in this light.<a name=295:12></a> Time will not permit to detail it, but as we see the Vessel of grace in this gospel by Luke, we should understand that the divine fulness in the Vessel of grace would be available for us.<a name=295:13></a> So that the spirit of the dispensation is imbibed, and we pattern our ways

		Hence, if it is a question of saying anything, what He says is entirely right, it never has to be in any wise modified.<a name=296:11></a> We often say things which we have to recall, we often take a step which we have to retrace, we often do things which we have to repudiate.<a name=296:12></a> But in Jesus, the Vessel of grace, everything was perfectly balanced and all was of such a character that He never expressed a word that had to be modified, never took up a position which He had to abandon.<a name=296:13></a> He never came to a judgment which He had to

		The course of the testimony of God and of Christ through this scene is one which gives a record of much sorrow.<a name=301:1></a> There have been joys that go along with it, but the passage of the testimony has been one of great difficulty, and as encountering the hostility of the enemy, its career has been a checkered one.<a name=301:2></a> I am thinking of it as entrusted to men here in responsibility, and how the enemy has, all the way through, endeavoured to wreck that which has been set up here for God.<a name=301:3></a> Our Lord Jesus, in building His assembly which would represent Him here, took full account of the enemy's designs.<a name=301:4></a> He was well aware that the enemy would dispute the ground, and that he would constantly rally his forces against the assembly.<a name=301:5></a> But He intimated at the very outset that the gates of hades would not prevail against it.<a name=301:6></a> All the scheming of the enemy cannot overthrow that which Christ builds.<a name=301:7></a> But on the side of the responsibility of man the enemy raided the territory, and subjected the people of God to constant warfare, invading and carrying off that which belonged to them as their inheritance.<a name=301:8></a> The history of the assembly will bear witness to this, particularly the letters to the seven assemblies in Revelation, which show how the assembly in its responsibility, as under the pressure of the enemy, has given way from time to time, surrendering valuable territory.<a name=301:9></a> We find that Thyatira represents how completely

		the whole outward position was corrupted, and from man's point of view there would be nothing left; everything gone.<a name=302:1></a> But even there Christ had those with whom He could make contact and to whom He could appeal.<a name=302:2></a> Then after those many conflicts, in which so many valuable treasures had been lost, the Lord has been faithful, and the element of recovery appeared, and the saints through warfare, no doubt, recovered some of those precious things which had been forfeited.<a name=302:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		For example, in the Reformation, in which the truth of justification, and other truths which had been lost were recovered.<a name=302:4></a> Then in Philadelphia we have assembly revival, the most wonderful recovery of the great truth of the assembly as loved by Christ.<a name=302:5></a> Just as these conflicts were spread over a protracted period, and the losses sustained were sustained not in one engagement but many, so the recovery of the truth and the recovery of the valuable property lost was not accomplished in one conflict.<a name=302:6></a> Soon after the recovery of the truth bearing upon the assembly, we find it contested by the enemy, and those who valued the truth of the assembly were quickly to be tested as to whether they could hold the ground in the face of the opposition of the enemy.<a name=302:7></a> The conflict was severe, and it centred around the Person of Christ.<a name=302:8></a> It was an attack on the Person of Christ and the order of His manhood.<a name=302:9></a> That attack was repulsed, but not only repulsed; it resulted in great spoil to the testimony and the enrichment of the truth.<a name=302:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then came a most subtle and severe conflict, not this time in relation to the manhood of our Lord Jesus, but in relation to "the body" which is the sequence to His manhood.<a name=302:11></a> The enemy was unable to dispossess the saints

		of the truth of His glorious manhood, but he endeavoured to rob them of the vitality of the truth as related to "the one body", and that "the body of Christ".<a name=303:1></a> This, instead of overthrowing what had been recovered, resulted in expansion and development of this inheritance of the people of God, giving further light in regard to the truth of "the body".<a name=303:2></a> The enemy still assailed the testimony, and the question of eternal life as the order of life promised, as the thought of God for men, and which was found in our Lord Jesus the "man, out of heaven", was also attacked.<a name=303:3></a> The result was that great light was imparted and further lost territory regained.<a name=303:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I mention all this as a preface, by way of answering a question which is constantly being addressed to us, as to why the light of our Lord's sonship, as now known, had not been brought out until the present moment.<a name=303:5></a> Just as the ground was not vacated in one engagement, but the battles were numerous.<a name=303:6></a> So too, the recovery is spread over a long protracted period, fitting in with the developments of the testimony in unison with the mind of heaven.<a name=303:7></a> And fitting in wholly to the thought of God, and as suited to what He is developing in the affections of the saints.<a name=303:8></a> So during the last twenty years there has been a remarkable flood of light.<a name=303:9></a> I do not question that it is light from God, coming through holy vessels which He has honoured, and to which we do well to give heed.<a name=303:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Before I say more about that, let me add that at no moment in the history of the truth, since the days of recovery, at no stage, has the Deity of our Lord ever been questioned amongst those walking in the truth.<a name=309:4></a> There has never been a moment when there was the slightest misgiving in the minds of the brethren as to that, for He is "over all, God blessed for ever" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#9:5">Romans  9:5</a>).<a name=309:5></a> That is cherished, guarded, as it were, but when Scripture speaks of Jesus as coming into this scene, He is ushered into this world as a Babe, touching, as another has said, humanity at its weakest point.<a name=309:6></a> What a contemplation for our hearts!<a name=309:7></a> Jesus, a Babe in swaddling clothes, and Luke would give us to understand that "the holy thing" born of Mary, "shall be called Son of God" <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:35">Luke  1:35</a>.<a name=309:8></a> God says, "<i>I</i> this day have begotten thee" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2:7">Psalm  2:7</a>).<a name=309:9></a> This expression can only refer to Christ subsequent to incarnation, and to carry the idea back prior to that, where the Godhead is seen subsisting in its own blessedness, and to speak of those Persons in relative terms of Father and Son, would mean confusion.<a name=309:10></a> Can you think of one of those divine Persons turning to the other, or thinking of the other as Father?<a name=309:11></a> Can you believe that one of those Persons would address the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would like for the sake of the young to make that point clearer, because I believe all the difficulty relative to the subject on hand lies in a misapprehension of the difference between Christ as coming from heaven, and Christ as sent into the world.<a name=310:6></a> If you will read the passages in John's gospel referring to <i>Son</i>, you will not get one solitary instance where it speaks of Him being <i>sent</i> from heaven.<a name=310:7></a> You will get several instances where He speaks of <i>coming</i> from heaven.<a name=310:8></a> He comes down from heaven, and as having come here, the Word become flesh tabernacling amongst us, God manifest in flesh is seen.<a name=310:9></a> He says, "I came forth from God", which refers to the incarnation, and then He adds, "and am come".<a name=310:10></a> That is, now He is present amongst us as the result of incarnation, but with an added thought that He is now <i>appearing publicly amongst men</i> as the full expression of God, and He says, "for neither am I come of myself, but <i>he</i> has sent me".<a name=310:11></a>

		Now, as to coming from heaven, I do not think He would say that, but as here in testimony.<a name=311:1></a> He would show us that He is here as having been sent <i>into</i> the world; that is, <i>sent</i> is subsequent to incarnation.<a name=311:2></a> I am delaying a little at this point, because I believe with many it is the real crux of the difficulty as to the apprehension and acceptance of the truth of our Lord's sonship being entered upon here in <i>time</i>.<a name=311:3></a> It has been concluded by many that, when Jesus speaks of Himself, as He so frequently does in John's gospel, as being sent by the Father, He is referring to the Father sending Him down from heaven.<a name=311:4></a> <i>That is a misconstruction</i> of the truth, and I believe it leads to confusion, and it obscures the apprehension of the sonship of Christ.<a name=311:5></a> The third passage from which I read would show how the Lord, in answer to the hostility of the crowd, particularly the Jewish leaders, meets the situation by referring to the way in which those to whom the word of God had come were spoken of as gods, and that the Scripture cannot be broken.<a name=311:6></a> Then He goes on to say, "do ye say of him whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#10:36">John  10:36</a>).<a name=311:7></a> You will notice the order "sanctified and sent", and I would like to dwell on that, because if you will take notice of this order it will, I believe, help to clear our vision.<a name=311:8></a> The light of God would shine upon our minds, and how ready the Holy Spirit is to serve us in this connection, so that we may have no misconception as to this great matter.<a name=311:9></a> The Spirit is waiting upon us to serve us, so that right ideas, right feelings, right affections, right regard, reverential regard indeed, may be formed in our hearts for Christ, the Son of God.<a name=311:10></a>

		Although we may rightly regard our Lord Jesus, from the very moment He entered this scene as a Babe, as sanctified, or set apart, yet I believe the public position would relate to what John records, when the Holy Spirit came down publicly and sealed Him, and sanctified Him in that way, set Him apart.<a name=312:3></a> From that point, I believe, we get the idea of His being "sent into the world".<a name=312:4></a> From that point Jesus is sent forth by God, sent forth by the Father; and as thus sent He reveals the Father.<a name=312:5></a> He declares God in the most perfect way, and He reveals the Father, bringing to light every feeling that lay in the heart of the blessed God, manifesting here all those divine and heavenly features which came out in all their fulness and grandeur.<a name=312:6></a> The manifestation of the Father was so perfect in every detail, that in answer to Philip's question He would say, "Am I so long a time with you, and thou hast thou not known me, Philip?<a name=312:7></a> He that has seen me has seen the Father" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#14:9">John  14:9</a>).<a name=312:8></a> What they had seen in Him was identical with what the Father was.<a name=312:9></a> Every trait, every quality, all that came out in Jesus here, can be perfectly identified with the Father, that is, the Father is seen in Him.<a name=312:10></a>

		I believe, dear brethren, that what God has before Him at the present time is to work, not only in His grace in ministering to us spiritually, but also in His government in disciplining us.<a name=317:1></a> He has in view to bring about in us full correspondence with the Leader of our salvation -- Christ.<a name=317:2></a> If there is to be full correspondence in us with the Lord Jesus, it implies that we should not only know our status, and position before God as sons, but that we should be here in this world as true <i>children</i>.<a name=317:3></a> In <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>, there are three quotations brought in and attributed to the Lord Jesus Christ, who is presented as the Leader of our salvation.<a name=317:4></a> God has appointed Him Leader to bring many sons to glory.<a name=317:5></a> That is the great end in view; and in the quotations which are attributed to Him, the highest thought is presented first: "I will declare thy name to my brethren; in the midst of the assembly will I sing thy praises".<a name=317:6></a> That implies that the saints are brought into accord with the Lord Jesus Christ as sons with Him in the presence of God.<a name=317:7></a> He can speak

	<div class="paragraph">
		I would like to say a few words as to this matter of <i>children</i>, for I feel that we ought to give more attention to it.<a name=320:8></a> The book of Isaiah has a good deal to say about children.<a name=320:9></a> In chapter 1 Jehovah has to say, "I have nourished and brought up children; and they have rebelled against me" (verse 2).<a name=320:10></a> We see that the affections of the heart of God require children -- "beloved children".<a name=320:11></a> Paul says: "Be ye therefore imitators of God, as beloved children" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:1">Ephesians  5:1</a>).<a name=320:12></a> How God's heart longs to have beloved children down here!<a name=320:13></a> From the point of view of substantial formation and likeness to God it is the highest truth.<a name=320:14></a> Sonship is a higher truth according to position and

		Then, as you go on in the book of Isaiah, you get the thought of Jerusalem yearning for children.<a name=321:5></a> It is very touching.<a name=321:6></a> Jerusalem above is our mother; and God considers for the yearnings of Jerusalem, and sees to it that she has children.<a name=321:7></a> In <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#49:20">Isaiah  49:20</a>, 21 we read: "The children of thy bereavement shall yet say in thine ears, The place is too narrow for me: make room for me, that I may dwell.<a name=321:8></a> And thou shalt say in thy heart, Who hath borne me these, seeing I had lost my children and was desolate, an exile, and driven about?<a name=321:9></a> and who hath brought up these?<a name=321:10></a> behold, I was left alone; these, where were they?<a name=321:11></a>" This shows how God considers for the mother heart of Jerusalem.<a name=321:12></a> While Jerusalem is desolate, God secures these children for her, brings them up, as it were, and presents them to her.<a name=321:13></a> No doubt it has an application to the joy which the earthly Jerusalem will yet have in seeing the <i>church as begotten by the testimony which</i>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#53:8">Isaiah  53:8</a> we have Christ Himself brought before us: "Who shall declare his generation?<a name=322:4></a> for he was cut off out of the land of the living".<a name=322:5></a> The heart of Christ requires children.<a name=322:6></a> It is the way the Lord views us as down here, taking character from Himself, begotten by His own service and testimony.<a name=322:7></a> It says, "Who shall declare his generation?<a name=322:8></a>" Could any of our hearts brook the thought that there should not be a generation here like Christ?<a name=322:9></a> that His life should not be continued in character here?<a name=322:10></a> It goes on to say, "He shall see a seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of Jehovah shall prosper in his hand".<a name=322:11></a> God will see to it -- and He is seeing to it -- that Christ has a seed.<a name=322:12></a> So how precious is this thought of children, -- God's heart desiring children, the heart of Jerusalem looking for children, and the heart of Christ requiring children!<a name=322:13></a> Divine affections require children, and <i>beloved children</i>.<a name=322:14></a> If we look at the New Testament we find the apostles Paul and John bringing out this side of the truth, as to children being like God and like Christ.<a name=322:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The early part of Isaiah bears on what we are passing through at the present time.<a name=324:2></a> Up to chapter 39 it is the Assyrian invasion which is largely in the prophet's mind, an invasion which occurred in Hezekiah's day, although it has a future bearing, alluding to the overflowing scourge which will again pass through the land in the near future.<a name=324:3></a> But this early part of the book had its immediate fulfilment in Hezekiah's day, and that section of the book closes with that, dealing with Hezekiah and the coming of Sennacherib king of Assyria.<a name=324:4></a> The latter part of the book deals more with the return from Babylon.<a name=324:5></a> The going to Babylon is foretold in chapter 39, and then immediately God says, "Comfort ye, comfort ye my people", and the latter part of the book speaks of the return from captivity.<a name=324:6></a>

		So the Assyrian comes up, and Hezekiah says, "This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of reviling" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#37:3">Isaiah  37:3</a>); but, thank God, Hezekiah gets to the root of the matter.<a name=326:1></a> It is a great thing to get to the root of the matter.<a name=326:2></a> If we see the reason for the discipline, we can be with God in relation to it.<a name=326:3></a> Hezekiah puts on sackcloth -- it would be well for us today to put on sackcloth -- and he says, "This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of reviling".<a name=326:4></a> Then he gives the reason: "for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth;" as much as to say, We have had wonderful assembly privileges, we have enjoyed the service of God together, but there has not been a really practical state that answered to it!<a name=326:5></a>

		Christ?<a name=327:1></a> Have we not enjoyed divine things in our spirits among the brethren?<a name=327:2></a> Yet outside our spirits have been so unlike the spirit of Christ, that He could hardly point to us and say, "Behold, I and the children which God has given me".<a name=327:3></a> We have not really been representing Him in our spirits, ways and words outside?<a name=327:4></a> To represent Christ in our spirits and words and ways outside involves having <i>that</i> as our one aim in life, and making everything else secondary; otherwise we shall never really be children who represent Christ as He was here, acting like God, speaking God's words, doing God's works.<a name=327:5></a> He filled out His place in testimony perfectly, and if we are true children in the sense in which I am speaking, it implies that we are like Him in that way, marked by His spirit, His acts and His words.<a name=327:6></a> You remember how in John's gospel, which speaks so much of the children of God, the Lord as the great example in testimony says, "I cannot do anything of myself" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#5:30">John  5:30</a>).<a name=327:7></a> Again, "I have not spoken from myself, but the Father who sent me has himself given me commandment what I should say and what I should speak .<a name=327:8></a>.<a name=327:9></a>.<a name=327:10></a> What therefore I speak, as the Father has said to me, so I speak" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#12:49">John  12:49</a>, 50).<a name=327:11></a> Perfect dependence marked the Lord.<a name=327:12></a> We cannot speak of the Lord as a child, in the way I am speaking of it, but what a beloved One He was in the humble dependence in which He trod His way, not speaking

		Now just a word as to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#110">Psalm  110</a>.<a name=346:3></a> It is necessary to say before speaking of this Psalm, that Hebrews, which particularly develops the glory of Christ as the anti-type of Melchisedec, emphasises that God's King is God's Son.<a name=346:4></a> We have spoken of the Lord's moral glories and of His official glories as King, as Warrior, in connection with the throne and sceptre, and lastly, within the palace.<a name=346:5></a> What He is <i>personally</i> enters into all that.<a name=346:6></a> What underlies all is His personal glory in manhood as Son.<a name=346:7></a> God's King is no less than God's Son.<a name=346:8></a>

		The Lord Jesus, in securing us down here under His authority, and then bringing us into His circumstances, into the glory and blessedness of the palace, has always in view that God should have His portion.<a name=347:6></a> The opening verse of this Psalm particularly applies to the present time.<a name=347:7></a> "Jehovah said unto my Lord, Sit at my right hand, until I put thine enemies as footstool of thy feet".<a name=347:8></a> The Lord has not yet taken His own throne, but is sitting at God's right hand.<a name=347:9></a> Hebrews views Him there and shows that His great occupation is to lead a priestly company in to God.<a name=347:10></a> He secures us in our affections as worshippers of Himself, for "he is thy Lord, and worship thou him" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#45:11">Psalm  45:11</a>), with a view to leading us in to God.<a name=347:11></a> This Psalm brings out the attractiveness of the position in this respect.<a name=347:12></a>

		I desire, as the Lord may help, to speak of a feature of Christ's glory in each of the three passages read, which bears on our position as belonging to the assembly.<a name=351:1></a> These chapters portray the greatness of Christ more fully than any other passages of Scripture.<a name=351:2></a> They are each unique; but there are certain features of correspondence about them.<a name=351:3></a> Each of the chapters stress that, in Person, He is <i>God</i>, none less than God; although each refers to His Deity in a different way.<a name=351:4></a> Each also makes it clear that He is the Person of the Godhead who brought this world into being -- indeed the whole universe.<a name=351:5></a> Each refers to His sonship as in manhood; and finally each refers to the universal bearing of His vicarious death.<a name=351:6></a> Colossians says, "In him all the fulness of the Godhead was pleased to dwell, and by him to reconcile all things to itself".<a name=351:7></a> John speaks of Him as "the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world".<a name=351:8></a> In Hebrews we have, "having made by himself the purification of

		sins", -- not simply our sins, but the whole question of sins.<a name=352:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But while the chapters have features in common, I wish to bring before you tonight the particular feature stressed in each passage.<a name=352:2></a> In the first passage we are told, "<i>He</i> is the head of the body, the assembly".<a name=352:3></a> This glorious Person is the Head of the body, the assembly; and, for a type, we must go back to Adam.<a name=352:4></a> Christ, in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1">Colossians  1</a>, is presented as One who entirely supersedes Adam, for He is "firstborn of all creation", in virtue of His being the Creator, and as such He is presented as Head.<a name=352:5></a> In the second passage, <a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>, He is presented as the Word, and what is in view as in John's gospel generally, is dwelling conditions for Divine Persons, -- home conditions.<a name=352:6></a> So He is introduced as the Word, the One who is the expression of all that is <i>suitable to Divine Persons</i>, the whole mind of God.<a name=352:7></a> For typical teaching we have to turn to Exodus.<a name=352:8></a> All types fall very far short, and a great deal has to be learnt by contrast, as in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:17">John  1:17</a> "For the law was given by Moses: grace and truth subsists through Jesus Christ".<a name=352:9></a> Nevertheless Moses secured dwelling conditions for God by bringing in the mind of God -- God's word -- so far as it could be known at that time.<a name=352:10></a> But in Jesus, "<i>the</i> Word", we have the mind of God in a perfect way.<a name=352:11></a> All that came in previously pales into insignificance beside Him, yet it is valuable as a type.<a name=352:12></a>

		<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1">Hebrews  1</a>particularly stresses that He is the Son, "God .<a name=353:1></a>.<a name=353:2></a>.<a name=353:3></a> has spoken to us in the person of the Son".<a name=353:4></a> All the early part of the chapter emphasises that: "For to which of the angels said he ever, <i>Thou</i> art my Son: this day have <i>I</i> begotten thee?<a name=353:5></a> and again, <i>I</i> will be to him for father, and <i>he</i> shall be to me for son?<a name=353:6></a>" What is specially in view in this epistle is to secure the service of praise; what we might speak of as public, priestly service worthy of God, worthy of the One who has spoken "in Son".<a name=353:7></a> So that Hebrews stresses that God's King, and God's Priest is God's Son.<a name=353:8></a> Put those three thoughts together, the priestly and kingly offices now held by the Son, and you can be sure that public priestly service will be secured.<a name=353:9></a> For a type we must go to Solomon.<a name=353:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe the first passage is basic, having to do with the relation between Christ and the assembly; and unless that relation is entered into by the saints, dwelling conditions will not be secured for God, nor conditions for priestly service.<a name=353:11></a> It is a great thing to see, dear brethren, that in securing and establishing the relations between Christ and the assembly, God secures all He is seeking for Himself.<a name=353:12></a> So that, at the end, when John "saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21:2">Revelation  21:2</a>), he heard a loud voice saying "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men".<a name=353:13></a> In that vessel "prepared as a bride adorned
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		for her husband", and thus presented as primarily for Christ, God has secured dwelling conditions for Himself.<a name=354:1></a> Then when the city is presented in its glory as "the bride, the Lamb's wife" (verse 9), we are told "His [i.<a name=354:2></a>e.<a name=354:3></a> God's] servants shall serve him, and they shall see his face; and his name is on their foreheads" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:3">Revelation  22:3</a>, 4).<a name=354:4></a> It refers to priestly service worthy of God's great name.<a name=354:5></a> It shows how important it is that we should understand, in some measure, the greatness of Christ as Head of the body, the assembly.<a name=354:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Spirit of God has in mind in <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1">Colossians  1</a>to bring the greatness of Christ before our hearts in such a way as to exclude every other object.<a name=354:7></a> If we are to know the blessedness of the relationship between Christ and the assembly, He Himself in His greatness must be before our hearts, so as to exclude every rival.<a name=354:8></a> In <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22:19">Luke  22:19</a>, He says, "This is my body which is given for you" -- a presentation calculated to secure the church wholly for Himself.<a name=354:9></a> If we entered into it we should never look to any other source for wisdom, light, food or for anything we need spiritually.<a name=354:10></a> That is one great point in Colossians, to save christians from looking anywhere else for the satisfaction of their souls, or for the meeting of their spiritual needs.<a name=354:11></a>

		Well, Peter is now again in the centre of the Lord's ways, but he has to be prepared for the great development which was about to definitely set aside the Jew, and portray the sovereign movements of God.<a name=371:4></a> He is prepared by a vision, and the vision gives the import of his ministry in opening the door to the gentile.<a name=371:5></a> I do not dwell on the detail, but just on the form of the vessel let down from heaven.<a name=371:6></a> It bears the similitude of a sheet.<a name=371:7></a> It is a vessel, that is the point; but at present it is as it were a sheet.<a name=371:8></a> It is reserved for Paul to give us the form and outline of the vessel, but so far as Peter carries us, it is a sheet.<a name=371:9></a> Now a sheet is a shapeless sort of thing, but has great capacity for holding things together.<a name=371:10></a> It has no symmetry, no form, nor beauty; no idea of design, but it has very great capacity to keep things together.<a name=371:11></a> In this sheet are all manner of creeping things, beasts of the field and fowl of the air.<a name=371:12></a> There are no fishes in it, but only what is connected with the earth and the air.<a name=371:13></a> In these two spheres the way had been opened for Satan to operate by the fall of man.<a name=371:14></a> Adam never took up headship over the sea, therefore this sphere was not opened to the power of evil, and hence the great resources of God are connected with the sea.<a name=371:15></a>

		I have read these passages to refer to the important idea of <i>handling</i>.<a name=377:1></a> It is expressed in the first chapter of 1 John, "our hands handled, concerning the word of life".<a name=377:2></a> I am speaking without premeditation, but it occurred to me that it is of the first importance to understand how <i>near</i> the Lord Jesus has come to men.<a name=377:3></a> One of the great matters which occupied God, in connection with His purpose concerning Christ, must have been how to come near to man.<a name=377:4></a> If we do not give thought to it, it may seem a very simple matter, but I believe it is most profound.<a name=377:5></a> Doubtless all the details of the humanity of the Lord Jesus, the body He was to take, the conditions of life in which He would live, and all the circumstances of His reception, were considered in view of nearness to man.<a name=377:6></a> They were a part of the counsels of God, which necessarily involve all the Persons of the Godhead.<a name=377:7></a> In those counsels a divine arrangement was entered into, of which the great matters were necessarily the incarnation, and the death of Christ, and the resurrection.<a name=377:8></a> But another matter, yet one of first importance, was how to get <i>near</i> to men.<a name=377:9></a> How to so present Him, that men could see Him, and touch Him.<a name=377:10></a> Yet that they should understand that a divine Person was there, and that nothing pertaining to His essential deity had been given up; only, what might be called the external surroundings had been changed (<a href="../bible/John.htm#17:5">John  17:5</a>), and these were, later, to be resumed.<a name=377:11></a>

		I am looking for help from the Lord to emphasise this thought of <i>nearness</i>, of the reality of the humanity of Christ.<a name=378:1></a> Thus our faith does not rest on what is imaginary, or visionary, but on what is substantial according to man's thoughts, as well as according to God's.<a name=378:2></a> You will understand, of course, that I am alluding especially to the Lord's body, to the form which He took.<a name=378:3></a>

		To call attention first to the passage in 1 John, it reads, "that which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes; that which we contemplated, and our hands handled, concerning the word of life; .<a name=378:4></a>.<a name=378:5></a>.<a name=378:6></a> we have seen, and bear witness, and report to you".<a name=378:7></a> The apostles actually saw and handled the Lord Jesus, and this report is given so that, by faith, we might come into the same nearness as they.<a name=378:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a certain progressive order in these statements, heading up in the thought of <i>handling</i>.<a name=378:9></a> It begins with hearing, which involves the gospel.<a name=378:10></a> The gospel comes by report, and so does faith, according to <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#10:16">Romans  10:16</a>, 17.<a name=378:11></a> So that in the gospel God approaches men as bringing to them, and supplying, all that is needed to establish a link of faith with Christ.<a name=378:12></a> God's power is attached to the gospel, as Paul says, "I am not ashamed of the glad tidings; for it is God's power to salvation, to every one that believes" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#1:16">Romans  1:16</a>).<a name=378:13></a> Christ was presented to man in responsibility and was rejected; fallen man thus showing his complete incapability to receive Christ.<a name=378:14></a> Hence the need of new birth and of the gift of faith, the former a sovereign act on God's part, the latter to be made use of by men.<a name=378:15></a> But this link having been established by <i>faith</i>, there is another aspect presented in the thought of <i>seeing</i>.<a name=378:16></a> Seeing involves a certain faculty which God established as an

		integral part of manhood, so that when Christ came men should see Him.<a name=379:1></a> Seeing involves that Christ is near, for man's vision is limited.<a name=379:2></a> Whatever else man's eyes may take account of, whether the glories of creation, or the works of man, his eyes were given him in view of seeing Christ; that is what sight was given for, just as man's ears were given primarily in view of hearing God's word.<a name=379:3></a> All the faculties of manhood are in view of Christ's incoming, so that as He is received in faith, there should be an apprehension of His greatness and moral worth and of His varied glories.<a name=379:4></a> All this would be to men as substance, and it is nothing less, for God was manifested in flesh; and yet throughout the Scriptures the inscrutability of the Person of Christ is asserted.<a name=379:5></a> There is that which pertains to Him as a divine Person that we have no capacity to take in, nor have we any license to pry into; but we know it is there, and we <i>must</i> know that it is there.<a name=379:6></a> No one could be a christian at all, if he did not believe in the deity of Christ; nor could anyone be a christian, if he did not believe in the real substantial manhood of Christ.<a name=379:7></a> These two thoughts are involved in the great basic doctrines of christianity.<a name=379:8></a>

		Now to go back to the passage read in Luke, it refers to the birth of Jesus.<a name=382:4></a> It says of Mary His mother that "she brought forth her first-born son, and wrapped him up in swaddling-clothes and laid him in the manger, because there was no room for them in the inn".<a name=382:5></a> What a holy vessel Mary was.<a name=382:6></a> One of the most distinguished persons in the Scriptures.<a name=382:7></a> The Holy Spirit came upon her.<a name=382:8></a> I do not doubt that mother-love entered into the matter, the natural side, which later the Lord had to adjust, but it is a normal thing that what is natural has to be adjusted to make way for what is spiritual.<a name=382:9></a> That is because God has such an understanding of us, that He has left room in His ordering in relation to Christ and the assembly, for certain natural relationships connected with families.<a name=382:10></a> A man is to love his wife, but he is always to have before him the thought of Christ and the assembly.<a name=382:11></a> But as one reads this account of the first person who handled the Lord, one can see what a great spiritual vessel she was.<a name=382:12></a> She "wrapped him up", it says, "in swaddling-clothes and laid him in the manger".<a name=382:13></a> She was a bondmaid of the Lord, a selected bondmaid of Jehovah.<a name=382:14></a> But though only a bondmaid, she stood in relation to this great matter, and the greatness of the Person who came thus into manhood.<a name=382:15></a> She was a vessel of the Spirit, filled with the Holy Spirit, so that holy hands and holy feelings entered into the first handling of the Lord Jesus.<a name=382:16></a> You might say that thousands of mothers have

		Before closing, I should like to make a brief reference to the passage in <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>, for there we have the thought of support.<a name=388:6></a> John is the disciple whom Jesus loved.<a name=388:7></a> He is leaning on His breast, receiving support.<a name=388:8></a> The breast is support, the bosom is comfort and love.<a name=388:9></a> He is receiving support.<a name=388:10></a> Now John does not speak in his gospel of Jesus as a little Child, as Luke does.<a name=388:11></a> That is Luke's side.<a name=388:12></a> John is speaking of Christ from the exalted viewpoint that "The Word became flesh, and dwelt among us (and we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father), full of grace and truth" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:14">John  1:14</a>).<a name=388:13></a> That is John's viewpoint, and hence in his presentation you find the breast and the bosom of Jesus.<a name=388:14></a> I want you to notice this, that a man, an adult man, John, is leaning on the breast of a Man.<a name=388:15></a> It is not the idea of a little child being carried, comforted and nursed; it is manhood in John drawing from the strength of the manhood of Jesus, a wonderful thought!<a name=388:16></a> There is nothing infantile about it, nothing small, nothing sentimental.<a name=388:17></a> I have heard people enthuse sentimentally on the idea of John leaning on the bosom of Jesus, but John is drawing strength from the <i>breast</i> of Jesus; he is drawing spiritual energy from the breast of Jesus that he might be a support to others.<a name=388:18></a> That is

		He knew that His hour had come that He should depart out of the world to the Father, and He is leaving men, responsible persons, not children, immature and infantile in their thoughts and ways, but men.<a name=389:3></a> Thus John is an example of his own gospel.<a name=389:4></a> It is a great principle, that if you set out certain truths, which are denied in your own life, your words are lacking in power, though they may be correct.<a name=389:5></a> But John is the example of his own gospel.<a name=389:6></a> He presents a glorious divine Person, who was in the beginning with God, and who was God, but who is here in flesh.<a name=389:7></a> He became flesh, and John is entering into this thought of His humanity, into the blessedness of it; he is deriving from it, from the breast of Jesus, the strength of His manhood.<a name=389:8></a> John is leaning on it and he is able to ask the question that Peter could not ask.<a name=389:9></a> Peter was at a distance, he was not on the breast, or in the bosom, of Jesus, and hence you will find the adjustments of Peter's early life are more or less violent.<a name=389:10></a> People that walk at a measure of distance from the Lord require more violent adjustments.<a name=389:11></a> That was so with Peter at the outset, he needed much breaking down to bring him nearer, and make him lean, to make him rest in the bosom of Jesus.<a name=389:12></a>

		This book shows that the elders and living creatures are able to worship God, as entering into His ways and thoughts, as Ruler, Creator, Redeemer and Judge.<a name=402:3></a> As regards God in each of these characters they are worshippers.<a name=402:4></a> One feels, dear brethren, that the Lord would help us to have a greater appreciation of God, as Paul speaks of Him, "the blessed and only <i>Ruler</i>".<a name=402:5></a> That is how Paul regarded God; to Paul there was only one Ruler and He was blessed!<a name=402:6></a> He looked beyond the immediate instruments -- there was <i>one</i> Ruler.<a name=402:7></a> It would help us in our outlook on the general state of affairs at the present time, God's public dealings, if we see <i>Him</i> as the blessed and only Ruler.<a name=402:8></a> He is blessed in what He allows, and in what He orders.<a name=402:9></a> Whatever happens we trace it back to Him.<a name=402:10></a>

		Finally, the most extensive note of worship in this book is in chapter 19, and is addressed to God as <i>Judge</i>.<a name=403:9></a> The word is, "true and righteous are his judgments", and the living creatures and elders fall down and worship.<a name=403:10></a> God would have us as worshippers of Himself in that character.<a name=403:11></a> We need to be <i>full</i> of eyes, to be with God in His judgments, to be so with Him in His judgments, so fully on His side, that we are worshippers of Him as Judge.<a name=403:12></a> We have come "to God the Judge of all", Hebrews says.<a name=403:13></a> That is what marks a true elder, that he is thoroughly with God in His judgments; he is a worshipper of God as Judge; but how can that come about unless we are full of eyes, before and behind, round and within?<a name=403:14></a> Dear brethren, that is what will qualify us.<a name=403:15></a> It is a necessity to qualify us as worshippers of God in these four aspects which I have mentioned: as Sovereign Ruler, as Creator, as Redeemer

		The thought in mind is to notice what is portrayed in the angels who appear in or near the sepulchre, and to see that the features set out in them are to be taken on by men as they enter into the triumph of the death and resurrection of Christ.<a name=425:1></a> These angels are attending at a difficult part of the unfolding of God's ways.<a name=425:2></a> They are very prominent and in key positions, necessarily so, because men are not yet ready to take over these positions.<a name=425:3></a> As men and women are qualified to represent heaven, to speak with heaven's words and portray heaven's feelings, the angels disappear; they have done their part.<a name=425:4></a> Now having this in mind, I wish to draw attention to certain distinctive references in each gospel.<a name=425:5></a> It is a beautiful feature of scriptural instruction that no one person attempts to tell everything.<a name=425:6></a> I am assured it is a great mistake to try to say even all that we know.<a name=425:7></a> For one thing, it might be confusing to the hearers, and also we have to soberly consider the fact that most of us can take in very little.<a name=425:8></a> Hence thoughts have to be selected with due regard to causing some particular feature of the glory of Christ to stand out in prominence.<a name=425:9></a>

		Now I will pass on to Mark, where we are told that certain women "bought aromatic spices that they might come and embalm him.<a name=428:2></a> And very early on the first day of the week they come to the sepulchre, the sun having risen.<a name=428:3></a> And they said to one another, Who shall roll us away the stone out of the door of the sepulchre?<a name=428:4></a> And when they looked, they see that the stone has been rolled away, for it was very great".<a name=428:5></a> Now it is interesting to notice what was in the mind of these women to do.<a name=428:6></a> They came to embalm Him.<a name=428:7></a> They were going to perpetuate the condition of death, to make it as permanent as they could.<a name=428:8></a> But on the way they speak together.<a name=428:9></a> There is great value in speaking about difficult things that are ahead of us.<a name=428:10></a> I know persons who cannot be helped; no one can help them.<a name=428:11></a> They obviously have a great obstacle in front of them, and no one can help them.<a name=428:12></a> Why?<a name=428:13></a> Because they will not speak.<a name=428:14></a> There is great gain in two women speaking together, not about current matters, nor a multitude of small things such as ordinarily occupy women, but about a great matter like this: "Who shall roll us away the stone?<a name=428:15></a>" They wanted to go into the sepulchre to do something for Him.<a name=428:16></a> I suggest, dear brethren, that it is essential for us to go into the sepulchre; not to add anything, not to perpetuate the appearance of death, nor, in our thoughts, to hold Christ there, but to see how wonderfully He has overcome the mighty power of death.<a name=428:17></a> When they looked they saw that the stone was rolled away.<a name=428:18></a> I say, dear brethren, with much confidence, that if you have a difficulty -- a very hard matter ahead of you -- and will face it and be prepared to

		And then it says, "And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right, clothed in a white robe, and they were amazed and alarmed".<a name=429:5></a> Doubtless the young man was an angel, because angels can take on the form of men, and they do so when the divine thought is to specially portray what belongs to manhood.<a name=429:6></a> This is a young <i>man</i>.<a name=429:7></a> He is sitting on the right, the place of power, of triumph.<a name=429:8></a> The Lord is now sitting on the right hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#8:1">Hebrews  8:1</a>), indicating that all that He undertook to do is done.<a name=429:9></a> This young man is sitting on the right in the sepulchre.<a name=429:10></a> It is a fine thing to see young men and young women in this position.<a name=429:11></a> Young men are needed, because there is a lot of service to do, to teach the saints and to show them the gain there is in looking into the death of Jesus.<a name=429:12></a> To do this you need to be young.<a name=429:13></a> You might be eighty as to years, but if you are to serve the brethren you must be a young man in your spirit.<a name=429:14></a> The service is never to take on the appearance of decrepitude; it is always to be maintained in the energy and freshness of youth, so that the brethren would be sensible that the ministry is in power.<a name=429:15></a> Mark, of course, in view of his own history, would especially have that in mind.<a name=429:16></a> So the young man says to the women, "Ye seek Jesus, the Nazarene, the crucified one".<a name=429:17></a>

		Notice the words, "the Nazarene".<a name=430:1></a> This word "Nazarene" adds to the thoughts of public weakness and humiliation, and that of reproach.<a name=430:2></a> "The Nazarene" is a term of reproach.<a name=430:3></a> Think of youthful freshness and power for victory in the service hidden under this name of reproach, "Jesus, the Nazarene"!<a name=430:4></a> Many who might benefit from that service turn away from the reproach; they are not prepared that God's triumph, and glorious victory in Christ, should be maintained down here in an outward condition of reproach and shame.<a name=430:5></a> But that is where God has hidden His power.<a name=430:6></a> We have to be helped to overcome this natural diffidence to attach ourselves to anything that is outwardly small and not accredited.<a name=430:7></a> We, all of us, have had to overcome the reproach of going to a little meeting room, rather than to a gorgeous edifice; and if you have not a spiritual ear, the singing of the brethren is very poor compared to the instrumental music of a public church.<a name=430:8></a> We have to overcome all that.<a name=430:9></a> The way into the triumph is through the tomb, as seeking Jesus the Nazarene, the crucified One.<a name=430:10></a> It is not a tomb filled with corruption, for the Lord saw no corruption.<a name=430:11></a> Martha could say about her brother, "he stinks already" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#11:39">John  11:39</a>).<a name=430:12></a> As regards ourselves we have to face the dreadful fact of corruption, but not so with the Lord.<a name=430:13></a> He saw no corruption.<a name=430:14></a> This tomb is filled with the fragrance of love's victory and love's sacrifice.<a name=430:15></a>

		In Luke's gospel we have added features.<a name=431:5></a> As the women were in perplexity because they found not the body of the Lord Jesus "two men suddenly stood by them in shining raiment".<a name=431:6></a> Luke's gospel -- and John's too -- is based on the idea that you would seek first of all to <i>work things out yourself</i>.<a name=431:7></a> No angels are in evidence until the women are in perplexity; then, suddenly, there are two men in shining raiment standing by them.<a name=431:8></a> The shining raiment is an added thought to the white raiment; it has taken on the reflection of the glory.<a name=431:9></a> As we study these accounts you will see how priestly and glorious Luke's narration is, and that there are two men, an assembly idea.<a name=431:10></a> The women are not helped until they are in perplexity, but when they get to that point there is help, and it is not just one "young man", it is "two men".<a name=431:11></a> It does not say 'young', but 'men' -- matured men -- and obviously from their garments they have in their souls the sense of the glory attached to the death of Christ.<a name=431:12></a> They say to the women, "Why seek ye the living one among the dead?<a name=431:13></a>" Notice the usefulness of a question.<a name=431:14></a> "Why?<a name=431:15></a>" We were speaking this afternoon about the mind.<a name=431:16></a> The fact of the matter is that very few people think anything out for themselves.<a name=431:17></a> The moment they meet anything difficult, they stop thinking and ask somebody.<a name=431:18></a> It is good to ask, but it is much better to think it out yourself, and then get confirmation, or

		Now I say all that to introduce what I have before me, which is to call attention to four persons, distinguished in the Scriptures, two men and two women, the product of God's workshop.<a name=440:5></a> I use the expression 'workshop' as one which I think you will understand.<a name=440:6></a> That is, all that these persons were, whether in moral beauty or in usefulness, is wholly of God.<a name=440:7></a> God would take us all in hand in a similar way, that is His intention.<a name=440:8></a> The fact that He has called us by the gospel, and given us power to repent, and attached us to Christ by faith, is a clear indication that He has in mind to pass us through His workshop, and to turn us out as finished products of His own skilful hand.<a name=440:9></a>

		Now before I go further, I might say this, that it is possible for any of us to hinder God.<a name=440:10></a> I am speaking now from our side.<a name=440:11></a> We can hinder Him.<a name=440:12></a> Some of us at the end of our days may be filled with sorrow as we view a wasted life, or if not wholly wasted, partly wasted.<a name=440:13></a> That may be.<a name=440:14></a> That is very sad.<a name=440:15></a> But it is possible for us all to be like Paul, as he refers to himself in 2 Timothy, that he has finished his course, he was ready to be offered; he was a finished product.<a name=440:16></a> He is reviewing his life from his side, and he is not looking back over a wasted lifetime, although his early

		Now to come back to my subject: I read a few verses from that well known chapter in <a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#23">2 Samuel  23</a>, where we are given a list of distinguished names, the names of David's mighty men, thirty-seven in all.<a name=441:4></a> Not a great many from one viewpoint, but if one of them could slay eight hundred Philistines at one time, then thirty-seven mighty men represent a great source of power and strength that God can call upon.<a name=441:5></a> They were all the product of having to do with David.<a name=441:6></a> All they knew they learned from David, that is from Christ.<a name=441:7></a> They are like the twelve disciples we read of this afternoon who companied with Jesus, and observed how He worked, how He used power and authority beneficially for men.<a name=441:8></a> They are formally named and commissioned, twelve most distinguished names.<a name=441:9></a> But David has thirty-seven.<a name=441:10></a> I do not want to say much about them, I just read two verses concerning one of them, not the greatest, but the one who comes <i>next</i>.<a name=441:11></a> I think it is a delightful matter to see how God has outstandingly great men, but when you look at the <i>next</i> you find moral greatness too.<a name=441:12></a> That is, it is not one man alone, and no one else to stand with him; this one who comes next, second, is worth looking at too.<a name=441:13></a> He stood with David when the men of Israel left him, and fought the Philistines until his hand was weary, indeed until his hand clave unto the sword.<a name=441:14></a> He wrought a great deliverance in Israel, and the people

		Now I am thinking of the chief man as perhaps linking up with what is inaugural; and I am thinking of this second man as a reserve man.<a name=442:2></a> He came in at a crisis when there was a failure on the part of others, just like the position today.<a name=442:3></a> You look around in the professing church and what you notice is that most of those who profess to know Christ have turned away from Him, they have found other lords, they have found other lovers.<a name=442:4></a> Christ is not to them the hidden Man of the heart.<a name=442:5></a> The mass of professing christians have turned away.<a name=442:6></a> Now what would the Lord do at such a time?<a name=442:7></a> He would bring out reserves, distinguished reserves.<a name=442:8></a> Everybody in fellowship today is potentially a noble, a prince.<a name=442:9></a> To be happily in fellowship today is not a commonplace matter, it is a distinguished matter.<a name=442:10></a> Those who are such are all princes, all noble persons; and why?<a name=442:11></a> Because the position calls for nobles; without princeliness, without nobility, without true moral worth the position would be insupportable.<a name=442:12></a> We should soon walk out of fellowship and go somewhere else.<a name=442:13></a> To remain involves that you fight the Philistines until your hand is weary, until your hand cleaves to the sword.<a name=442:14></a> What does that mean?<a name=442:15></a> That the man and the sword are inseparable, that is, grown together; so intense is the conflict, so arduous and so long.<a name=442:16></a> But if you see the matter through -- as you can if you desire it, for God can qualify you and He will -- if you see the matter through you will be of great benefit in Israel and the people will follow you only to spoil.<a name=442:17></a> Now you may say, You are presenting a very lovely picture, but this was a very distinguished man.<a name=442:18></a> But why should you not be

		Now this man in devotion, in military skill, is outstanding, but the next man that I want to speak about is not a soldier, his skill is not with weapons.<a name=443:12></a> Weapons are needed, a soldier is needed; be assured that without conflict the enemy would soon take all that we have, every bit of it.<a name=443:13></a> Alas, how few there are amongst the saints that know that there is any conflict going on!<a name=443:14></a> They do not know it.<a name=443:15></a> If I were to tell you about somebody in this country who did not know there was a war on, you would say, How is it possible?<a name=443:16></a> But alas, there are people in fellowship, filling out their routine in their own localities, who do not know there is any conflict going on; and yet without such as David's mighty men the enemy would soon take all that we have from us.<a name=443:17></a>

		THE ASSEMBLY AS A TRUSTWORTHY VESSEL
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		G R Cowell
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24:67">Genesis  24:67</a>; <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#25:25">1 Samuel  25:25</a>, 32, 33, 41, 42; <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#31:10">Proverbs  31:10</a> - 12, 23, 27, 28; <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:18">Matthew  16:18</a>.<a name=451:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I desire, dear brethren, to say a word on the trustworthiness of the assembly.<a name=451:2></a> In considering such a subject we have, of course, to take an abstract view of the assembly; but I hope such a view will stimulate our desires to be marked by the feature of trustworthiness proper to the assembly.<a name=451:3></a> Each of the passages we have read in the Old Testament bring the assembly before us, in type, in its wifely character.<a name=451:4></a> In the first case, Isaac led Rebecca into his mother Sarah's tent, and, it says, he took her and she became his wife and he loved her and he was comforted after his mother's death.<a name=451:5></a> I think the reference to Sarah's tent indicates that the Lord relies upon the assembly to carry through, in spiritual power, every feature of the testimony that was once committed to Israel.<a name=451:6></a> To carry it through with heavenly lustre -- to carry it through on a level to which Israel could never rise.<a name=451:7></a> In Samuel, Abigail comes forward as marked by discernment; she had discernment to meet the crisis in such a way that David's name was not dishonoured.<a name=451:8></a> It says, David sent ten young men to greet Nabal <i>in his name</i>, and his name and Jehovah's name would have been dishonoured had not Abigail come forward to meet the situation.<a name=451:9></a> David says, "Blessed be thy discernment, and blessed be thou".<a name=451:10></a> I think the chapter brings before us the trustworthiness of the

		<a name=452>[Page 452]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		assembly in that respect.<a name=452:1></a> The Lord counts upon the assembly to be trustworthy in meeting conditions of crisis by the exercise of true discernment and in doing what is required to maintain the glory of His name.<a name=452:2></a> Then in Proverbs, both the wifely and motherly features come into evidence in connection with the virtuous woman; and it says, "The heart of her husband confideth in her".<a name=452:3></a> It is evidently a matter of trustworthiness particularly in regard to the household.<a name=452:4></a> It is a very important matter that the household should be cared for, so that, in the ultimate issue, her children rise up and call her blessed.<a name=452:5></a> Surely the Lord counts upon the assembly to fill out that role, so that there should be children who rise up and call the assembly blessed as having proved the maternal care that is found in it.<a name=452:6></a> I read the passage in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>because it shows that the trustworthiness of the assembly is on account of the material of which it is composed, and the rock upon which it is built.<a name=452:7></a> "<i>Thou</i> art Peter, and on this rock I will build my assembly, and hades' gates shall not prevail against it".<a name=452:8></a> We should be exercised to be characteristically that kind of material, because if we are not true 'Peters', that is, true living stones, we shall not be reliable in the settings to which I have already referred.<a name=452:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in connection with Rebecca, the secret underlying her fitness for the position in Sarah's tent was the service of Abraham's servant, who is a type of the Spirit; and the fact that room was made for him and his service.<a name=452:10></a> One would raise the exercise with us, dear brethren, as to how far we make way for the Spirit's service in our local gatherings.<a name=452:11></a> We would all desire that the Rebecca character should mark the local companies,

		and I think it helps to see that this type peculiarly fits in with local settings, because Rebecca is a type of the assembly at the present time.<a name=453:1></a> Eve, as a type, includes the assembly as a whole -- the church complete.<a name=453:2></a> But Rebecca applies to the present time, as Paul says to the Corinthians, "I have espoused you unto one man, to present you a chaste virgin to Christ" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#11:2">2 Corinthians  11:2</a>).<a name=453:3></a> The provisional position in Sarah's tent has to be filled out now.<a name=453:4></a> It will not apply when we are with the Lord.<a name=453:5></a> Sarah's tent has no application when the Lord comes, for Israel will again take up her place on the earth.<a name=453:6></a> But it is a question of filling out a provisional position <i>now</i> and thereby being a comfort to the heart of Christ.<a name=453:7></a> It must, therefore, have a peculiar application to local companies, because that is the <i>present form</i> in which the assembly exists.<a name=453:8></a> The Rebecca feature was, no doubt, seen in a special way in the Pentecostal church at Jerusalem, but it continues throughout the dispensation.<a name=453:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So Paul says to a local company, "I have espoused you unto one man, to present you a chaste virgin to Christ".<a name=453:10></a> And one great point in the Spirit's service at the present time is to bring about in every locality what answers to "a chaste virgin to Christ".<a name=453:11></a> So that in every city where the saints of God are, there should be a company with chaste affections set upon one Man; the saints in unity in the matter.<a name=453:12></a> Rebecca is a type of the saints moving in unity to Christ with chaste affections.<a name=453:13></a> What a precious thought, that in the cities of men this character of things should exist.<a name=453:14></a> In cities, men run after this man and that, but how much it means to the heart of Christ and of God that

		The Spirit is seen typically in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24">Genesis  24</a>in three ways: as <i>the well, the man, and the camels</i>.<a name=454:3></a> If we avail ourselves of the well, all our meetings will be in freshness.<a name=454:4></a> But we also need to make room for the Spirit's <i>personal</i> service, as seen typically in the man.<a name=454:5></a> The man raises the questions "Is there room in thy father's house for us to lodge?<a name=454:6></a>" Do <i>we</i> make room for the Spirit?<a name=454:7></a> Do we make way for His personal service in our meetings?<a name=454:8></a> As the Lord says, "He shall glorify me, for he shall receive of mine and shall announce it to you" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#16:14">John  16:14</a>).<a name=454:9></a> We need to see to it that there is room for the Spirit to unfold the glories of Christ.<a name=454:10></a> What potentialities there are in the ministry meeting, and in the reading meeting!<a name=454:11></a> Making room for the Spirit involves making room for one another in love, making way for the manifestations of the Spirit through whomsoever they may come.<a name=454:12></a> With what holy restfulness we can sit down together if we recognise that <i>He</i> is present to take of Christ's things and show them to us.<a name=454:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		And then Laban says that there is room for the camels.<a name=454:14></a> The ten camels suggest the full recognition of responsibility to care for the assembly of God.<a name=454:15></a> We are to be available to the Spirit in this service.<a name=454:16></a> The camel is a beast of burden, and the word is, "Bear one another's burdens, and thus fulfil the law of the Christ" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#6:2">Galatians  6:2</a>).<a name=454:17></a> When Isaac lifted up his eyes "behold, camels were coming".<a name=454:18></a> The camels ensured that Rebecca would arrive at the meeting-place fresh, wholly available for the heart of Isaac, not in any way jaded by the journey.<a name=454:19></a> The journey only becomes an occasion to prove what love can do for
