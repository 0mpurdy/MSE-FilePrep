		The Lord Jesus Christ is presented to us here in a twofold way, and I conceive that the apprehension of Christ in this twofold way is most important.<a name=2:4></a> I only speak for the moment of apprehension; but you will find this to be true as we proceed with what we have before us.<a name=2:5></a> There are four A's with regard to growth in Christ.<a name=2:6></a> The first "A" is APPREHENSION; there must be apprehension.<a name=2:7></a> I do not see how anything like spiritual movement can take place or be accomplished in our souls apart from the apprehension of Christ.<a name=2:8></a> Then, following apprehension, there comes APPRECIATION.<a name=2:9></a> It is a very simple thing to say, but it is impossible to appreciate one whom you do not apprehend.<a name=2:10></a> We apprehend Him, and the light in which we apprehend Him becomes the measure of our appreciation of Him.<a name=2:11></a> What a wonderful thing to have, in any measure, an appreciation of Christ!<a name=2:12></a> And then there is another "A", and that is the "A" of APPROPRIATION.<a name=2:13></a>

		You <i>appropriate</i> Him.<a name=3:1></a> I do not think, as we have sometimes been told, that appropriation is a function of faith.<a name=3:2></a> Appropriation is by love; it is love that appropriates.<a name=3:3></a> Faith apprehends, faith perceives, faith is really the soul coming into the light of Christ.<a name=3:4></a> God has only one object to present and that is CHRIST, and apprehension of Him is the light coming into our souls.<a name=3:5></a> Then there is appreciation.<a name=3:6></a> And there is a scripture that will help us as to that.<a name=3:7></a> You will find it in Galatians: "Faith worketh by love".<a name=3:8></a> That is how faith operates; it is faith working <i>by</i> love that appreciates, and then there is love -- affection for Christ.<a name=3:9></a> Let me go over it.<a name=3:10></a> When there is apprehension and appreciation of Christ, what marks the soul?<a name=3:11></a> Affection for Christ.<a name=3:12></a> If you apprehend Him and appreciate Him, you love Him.<a name=3:13></a> It is this affection for Himself that appropriates.<a name=3:14></a> And the result of appropriation is ASSIMILATION.<a name=3:15></a> You are assimilated to Christ; you become like Christ.<a name=3:16></a> That is what God's heart is set upon with regard to us all at the present time.<a name=3:17></a> It is to make us like Christ.<a name=3:18></a> Why?<a name=3:19></a> Well, Christ has been here; He was under the eye of God on earth for three-and-thirty years, and (I do not know how better to express it) those three-and-thirty years were for God's heart an unbroken period of feasting and delight.<a name=3:20></a> What must it have been for God after four thousand

		Now what I want to put before you simply is the twofold way in which He is spoken of.<a name=5:9></a> I repeat, it is not my thought at the present time to dwell upon the revelation of God in Him.<a name=5:10></a> "No one has seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, <i>he</i> hath declared him".<a name=5:11></a> God has been perfectly declared, perfectly made known, perfectly revealed in Him who is the Image of the invisible God, who is the brightness, the effulgence, the outshining of God's glory, and the "exact expression" of God's substance.<a name=5:12></a> He has accomplished the work of redemption.<a name=5:13></a> He has taken up the question of sin.<a name=5:14></a> He has answered according to the glory of God, and God has reaped a revenue of glory from the atoning death of the Lord that He never could have reaped from an eternity of Adam in innocency.<a name=5:15></a> If one might venture to say it,

		God is richer in glory since the cross than ever before.<a name=6:1></a> It is not only that there has been compensation for all the dark shame and dishonour of sin, but God is richer in glory than He ever was before.<a name=6:2></a> Christ died.<a name=6:3></a> God raised Him, and let Peter tell what we want to express, in the end of his discourse on the day of Pentecost when he said: "Let the whole house of Israel therefore know assuredly that God has made him, this Jesus whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ".<a name=6:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to speak of Him as Lord for a moment.<a name=6:5></a> He has not only been down here and revealed God and accomplished that wonderful work of atonement or redemption on the cross, in which God has been perfectly glorified and the whole question of sin has been taken up and definitely settled, but He has secured, so to speak, for man, all the grace that fills the heart of God.<a name=6:6></a> And now God has raised Him up, and exalted Him, and made Him Lord.<a name=6:7></a> What does that mean?<a name=6:8></a> It means this -- that God has made Him the Administrator of all the grace that fills the heart of God, and which God is so free to dispense on the ground, not only in the light of the revelation of Himself, but on the ground of the death of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=6:9></a> Now, the Lord Jesus Christ is the Administrator of that grace, and that is all gathered up in that beautiful expression in

		Now, you will find in this first Epistle of Peter, all through the first chapter, culminating in the third verse of the second chapter, that the Lord Jesus Christ is presented as <i>Lord</i>.<a name=7:3></a> That is what He is on God's side man-ward in the administration of the grace of the heart of God.<a name=7:4></a> And so we get redemption and "being born again".<a name=7:5></a> Let me tell you, "born again" in 1 Peter is not the same expression in the Greek that is translated in <a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>"born again".<a name=7:6></a> "Born again" in <a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>is really "born anew", but in the first Epistle of Peter it stands for the whole work of God in the soul that constitutes a person a Christian.<a name=7:7></a> There is redemption -- the great work <i>for</i> them; and there is "born again", the great work <i>in</i> them.<a name=7:8></a> Chapter 2 opens in a very simple and yet a very instructive way.<a name=7:9></a> It says, "<i>Wherefore</i>".<a name=7:10></a> (That word "wherefore" is built up on what precedes, on all that comes out in chapter 1.<a name=7:11></a>) "<i>Wherefore</i> laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings" -- five things.<a name=7:12></a> Wherefore laying all these things aside.<a name=7:13></a> Why lay them aside?<a name=7:14></a> Because they are the miserable workings and activities of the flesh.<a name=7:15></a> Although you are redeemed, although you are born again, there must

		These seven chapters -- I mean those from chapter 6 to chapter 12 -- form a distinct section of the prophecies by Isaiah.<a name=50:2></a> And the great theme of these chapters is the remnant.<a name=50:3></a> It is a very complete and definite history of the remnant; it is very precise at both ends; that is to say, at the beginning and at the end; for instance, mark the definite way it begins, "In the year that king Uzziah" -- how the Spirit of God puts His finger, as it were, down on the exact time.<a name=50:4></a> And what is the next word?<a name=50:5></a> I -- Isaiah; I, the prophet, the writer of this book: "In the year that king Uzziah died I <i>saw</i> also the Lord [Jehovah] sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple".<a name=50:6></a> Now there could not be a more precise and definite beginning than that.<a name=50:7></a> And what about the end?<a name=50:8></a> Turn to it for a moment: the end is in chapters 11 and 12.<a name=50:9></a> In chapter 11 it says, "And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots: and the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord .<a name=50:10></a>.<a name=50:11></a>.<a name=50:12></a> .<a name=50:13></a> And

		Now, Isaiah, in chapter 6, describes his own experience; he testifies as a man can testify if he has seen anything; he can tell what he has seen, and if he has heard anything he can tell what he has heard.<a name=53:10></a> As John says: "That which we have seen and heard we testify to you".<a name=53:11></a> So Isaiah says, I <i>saw</i> the Lord sitting upon a throne and what then?<a name=53:12></a> He saw the seraphim, and he heard them, and then he witnessed of what he saw and heard.<a name=53:13></a> But my point at the moment is this -- Isaiah gives us here, in connection with his own experience, what he actually saw, what he heard, and what he was constrained, as the result of what he saw and

		But now (though it is not exactly right to speak about a remnant of the assembly), our own times are remnant times, and they have been remnant times for some time back, and that is the particular interest of this part of scripture on account of its application to us.<a name=54:2></a> The conditions and the principles of the remnant must be our conditions and principles, otherwise no matter what your outward position may be, and it might be that you would pass muster in a way; for instance, you are breaking bread; that is all right -- (and hold on, beloved); but we must have things in reality.<a name=54:3></a> That is the particular value of this scripture.<a name=54:4></a>

		effect upon you?<a name=55:1></a> You learn this -- that if these are remnant times your individual history must be involved; for if your individual history is not involved <i>you are not in it</i>.<a name=55:2></a> If we turn to the New Testament -- to <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2">2 Timothy  2</a>, we find "Let every <i>one</i>" -- that is, every individual, not every two or three -- but "let every <i>one</i> who names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity, and if a <i>man</i>" -- that does not mean a male; it means a <i>person</i> -- an individual: "If one shall have purged himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour"; as Mr.<a name=55:3></a> Darby rightly says, it is "<i>himself</i>, not somebody else".<a name=55:4></a> "If therefore one have purged himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour".<a name=55:5></a> And now notice another thing about Isaiah, and a very important thing it is: What is the point of his experience here?<a name=55:6></a> -- <i>he learns deliverance</i>.<a name=55:7></a> Is it deliverance from what he has <i>done</i>?<a name=55:8></a> No, deliverance from what <i>he is</i>.<a name=55:9></a> He says, "Woe is me!<a name=55:10></a> for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips".<a name=55:11></a> And then being clear about himself, of course he is clear about his associations.<a name=55:12></a> You often find people finding fault with their associations.<a name=55:13></a> They grumble about others they do not like the sects and the systems; but they seem to like themselves pretty well.<a name=55:14></a> Such people are not in the remnant spirit.<a name=55:15></a> We touch here a very practical point.<a name=55:16></a> Ah, beloved, it

		We desire to present to you a few simple thoughts in connection with this scripture.<a name=118:1></a> I think there is common agreement amongst God's people who have a measure of light and understanding, that the Epistle to the Romans lays the foundation of Christianity.<a name=118:2></a> It presents the foundation in a twofold way -- the foundation for <i>faith</i> which is objective, and the foundation subjectively.<a name=118:3></a> What we mean by subjectively is that which is connected with the indwelling and work of the Spirit of God in us.<a name=118:4></a> Speaking of this epistle, in the order in which the truth is presented, we have first -- <i>faith</i>.<a name=118:5></a> From chapter 3 to verse 11 of chapter 5 you cannot fail to see that faith is very prominent; "believing", that is, faith, is constantly spoken of.<a name=118:6></a> That is objective; it is what is presented from God to us.<a name=118:7></a> Then from the beginning of verse 12 of chapter 5 we do not hear any more about believing.<a name=118:8></a> From thence we get the subjective side.<a name=118:9></a>

		failed to distinguish between the two sides of Christianity, and that is serious, but it is equally serious to separate the one side from the other side, and that is the second danger.<a name=119:1></a> We may suffer from confusion -- the lack of distinction -- and we may suffer from separating one part from another.<a name=119:2></a> In scripture the two sides are never confounded and never separated.<a name=119:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		the assembly in its local character.<a name=131:1></a> The Lord has established the assembly, in the character of which I speak, to be in testimony for Himself.<a name=131:2></a> The idea of a lamp or candlestick is light, and light is testimony, and the assemblies here are spoken of as on the ground of responsibility.<a name=131:3></a> The character of responsibility attaches to them; the responsibility is to be here in testimony for Himself.<a name=131:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now if the Lord has established His assembly in this way and character, and it is incontrovertible from this scripture that He has, we cannot conceive of the Lord failing to maintain here a testimony for Himself in connection with the assembly, however great the ruin.<a name=131:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We all know that the first assembly of these seven -- Ephesus, is marked out as the beginning or starting-point of declension, and, speaking generally of these seven assemblies, they set before us a downward course of declension and failure.<a name=131:6></a> They go from bad to worse, and when we reach the last, things have gone to the very worst; so much so, that the Lord says to Laodicea, "I will spue thee out of my mouth".<a name=131:7></a> That is final and decisive; the Lord actually and absolutely rejects it; there is no hope of recovery held out to Laodicea.<a name=131:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to speak about Philadelphia -- the last but one of the seven of these local assemblies.<a name=131:9></a> Now Philadelphia stands for that which is perfectly

		suitable and agreeable to the Lord; it stands for that which He can approve of and encourage.<a name=132:1></a> I would like simply, without any attempt at argument, to bring before you the fact that Philadelphia was literally an assembly, and hence it furnishes a suitable representation of the truth of the assembly, and Philadelphia goes on to the end.<a name=132:2></a> I want you to see this because the question is raised sometimes -- Will the Lord sustain to the end the truth of the assembly, will He maintain it, will it be here, or must we give up faith with regard to it?<a name=132:3></a> Must we abandon ourselves to the alternative of trying to do the best we can under the circumstances?<a name=132:4></a> I think the Lord's message to Philadelphia provides a very clear and distinct answer to that question.<a name=132:5></a> It encourages us in the assurance that the Lord will sustain the truth of the assembly down to the very close, so we need not give up.<a name=132:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Things must be stated clearly.<a name=132:7></a> To speak of the truth of the assembly is not pretension or assumption!<a name=132:8></a> No, the Lord never did sustain pretension.<a name=132:9></a> To say He does not is nothing peculiar to the present moment, for He <i>never</i> did; but I cannot conceive of the Lord giving up the truth of His assembly, I mean in the sense of having the truth of it maintained down here in testimony to the end.<a name=132:10></a>

		If you have given up all thought of the truth

		of the assembly being maintained at the present time, I can only say that I am not a bit in sympathy with you, and if you do not treasure <i>in your soul</i> the truth of the assembly, I am <i>sorry</i> for you.<a name=133:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let me emphasise this -- The Lord is not taken up with certain persons or individuals <i>as such</i>.<a name=133:2></a> I will tell you what He <i>is</i> taken up with -- with the truth of His assembly, and that because of its relationship to Himself.<a name=133:3></a> I cannot conceive of the Lord not being interested in that which so closely concerns His own honour and glory.<a name=133:4></a> I can understand ourselves not being interested in it, though it is to our shame, but I cannot conceive the Lord becoming indifferent to what involves His honour and glory.<a name=133:5></a> If He encourages Philadelphia, it is because the saints there are found identified with the truth of what His heart is set on.<a name=133:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now as to what involves the Lord's glory down here, we get three things mentioned -- "<i>My</i> word, <i>my</i> name, and the word of <i>my</i> patience".<a name=133:7></a> Just think soberly before the Lord of those three things.<a name=133:8></a> The Lord is not here.<a name=133:9></a> From the standpoint of this book He is absent, but His <i>word</i>, His <i>name</i>, and the <i>word of His patience are</i> here; and those three things involve His honour and His glory.<a name=133:10></a> The Lord approves those in Philadelphia, and encourages them because they have kept His word and have not

		denied His name.<a name=134:1></a> That was true locally in regard to that local assembly in Philadelphia, but speaking of that assembly, which existed, one thousand nine hundred years ago, is not enough, the message of the Spirit to that assembly must have an application to the very end, because it goes on to His coming.<a name=134:2></a> He says to Philadelphia, "I come quickly: <i>hold fast</i>", etc.<a name=134:3></a> The whole construction of the message supposes that this assembly continues to the close.<a name=134:4></a> No one dies in Philadelphia, there are no deaths, Philadelphia is here till the rapture, hence it is He says, "Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee".<a name=134:5></a> How does He keep them out of the trial?<a name=134:6></a> Just the same way that the Lord kept Enoch out of the flood by taking him away before it came, so He will "keep" Philadelphia by taking her away before the hour of trial comes.<a name=134:7></a> Enoch was never in the flood, God took him before the flood came, and so it is here; Philadelphia goes on to the end, until the Lord comes to take His assembly to Himself.<a name=134:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Pressure may have come upon you to let go, to give up the truth of the assembly, but this message is most encouraging, for this message of the Spirit is the assurance that the Lord is going to maintain the truth of His assembly to the very end.<a name=134:9></a> I am in sympathy with Him about it, and I would like to be in the testimony

		Then another point in Philadelphia -- there is no trace of <i>publicity</i>; there is no trace of anything that men as such can take account of, no indication of anything that lies under the eye of man.<a name=135:8></a> There was once, for instance, in the assembly at Corinth, as we can see in 1 and 2 Corinthians.<a name=135:9></a> If you had gone down to that city they would have told you there were three classes of people there -- Jew, Gentile, and the assembly of God.<a name=135:10></a> If you had asked -- <i>Where</i> is the assembly of God, an intelligent Corinthian might have answered, They have a meeting

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We desire, beloved, to call your attention to the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ, especially in the light of this gospel -- the Gospel of John.<a name=164:1></a> I can only briefly rehearse the points which we attempted to bring before you last week.<a name=164:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We called your attention to the wonderful fact (one might almost call it the basal fact) of incarnation.<a name=164:3></a> The scriptural statement of incarnation is in chapter 1: 14 of this gospel: "And the Word <i>became</i> [not was made] flesh, and dwelt among us (and we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father), full of grace and truth".<a name=164:4></a> Then we reminded you of verse 18, and how in that verse the full truth of the Person of the One who became flesh is unfolded, and the moment the full truth of His Person, as the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, comes before us, <i>the Father is declared</i>.<a name=164:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We attempted to bring before you from the Gospel of John what incarnation really involves, and one feels it to be so great a subject
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that one is conscious how little one can rightly speak of it.<a name=165:1></a> It was the way which God took to make Himself known to man; it was the necessity for the desire on the part of God to reveal Himself; there was no other way to reveal Himself.<a name=165:2></a> In incarnation God has brought Himself into revelation, and thus He has brought Himself within the range of man's apprehension; and if we look at it on our side it is equally true that we could never have known God apart from incarnation; He must have remained the invisible God dwelling in unapproachable light that no man hath seen nor can see; not but what He is still that, but He has come out in the revelation of Himself in Christ.<a name=165:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We tried to show you that the revelation of God is connected with two thoughts; there is the nature of God as light and as love -- putting the statements in the order in which the Spirit gives them in the first Epistle of John.<a name=165:4></a> There we read "God is light" and then "God is love".<a name=165:5></a> But there is more than this in connection with incarnation, for in the revelation of God we have divine Persons revealed.<a name=165:6></a> When I say divine Persons revealed, I am not forgetting what the Lord said in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11">Matthew  11</a>about Himself, "No man knoweth the Son but the Father", but I mean that we have divine Persons so far declared that we can speak of the

	<div class="paragraph">
		Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit; and this belongs to the very foundation of Christianity.<a name=166:1></a> We all know that christian baptism is into the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost; and in that there is a certain revelation of the affections which subsist between divine Persons in the Godhead.<a name=166:2></a> In chapter 1: 18 the declaration of God is spoken of as an accomplished fact: "He <i>hath</i> declared him", not "He <i>is</i> declaring him".<a name=166:3></a> We do well to consider that the gospels not only cover the life of the Lord as Man down here, but they cover His death.<a name=166:4></a> No one can understand any one of the gospels excepting in the light of the death of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=166:5></a> I make this statement in order to show that the revelation of God really covers, not only the Lord's life here in flesh, as a Man, but it covers His death, so we might say that the revelation of God culminates and finds its completeness in the death of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=166:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This leads us to speak of His death, and remember we are speaking from the Gospel of John; indeed, in a sense, <i>we need</i> not speak of it -- we do well to call your attention to <i>His own speaking</i> about His death, and He speaks of it definitely twice in this gospel.<a name=166:7></a> He speaks of it in chapter 3: 14, 15.<a name=166:8></a> He says to Nicodemus: "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, thus must the Son of man be lifted up,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=167>[Page 167]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that every one who believes on him may have life eternal".<a name=167:1></a> The words "may not perish" are doubtful in verse 15, they are not doubtful in verse 16.<a name=167:2></a> So that the Lord speaks of His death as the antitype of the lifting up of the brazen serpent in the wilderness, and the great point is that the one believing on Him should have life eternal.<a name=167:3></a> But what is the connection between His being lifted up and the one believing on Him having eternal life?<a name=167:4></a> I apprehend it is this -- eternal life belongs (and you have only to look into scripture to see it) not to man according to flesh, viewed as in responsibility, it is connected in scripture with the purpose of God, and the believing one may have it; all that has been connected with man in the flesh must find its judicial termination under the judgment of God, and that took place on the cross -- "God, having sent his own Son, in likeness of flesh of sin, and for sin [that is, as a sacrifice for sin], has condemned sin in the flesh" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:3">Romans  8:3</a>) -- so that all my history as a man in flesh is no hindrance to my having life eternal, for whosoever believeth on Him <i>has</i> life eternal.<a name=167:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there is the other passage in <a href="../bible/John.htm#12:24">John  12:24</a>, where the Lord again speaks of His death, and He says, "Except the grain of wheat falling into the ground die, it abides alone; but if it die, it bears much fruit".<a name=167:6></a> In chapter 3 it is a
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=168>[Page 168]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		question of the removal of that which is contrary to God, but in chapter 12 it is the other side, it is the question now of the grain bearing fruit -- of bringing a new generation into existence; so that the believing one is not only connected with the death of Christ as ending the history of man according to flesh, but he becomes part of a generation that had no existence prior to the death of Christ, save in His own Person .<a name=168:1></a>.<a name=168:2></a>.<a name=168:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to speak a little of His resurrection, and also of His ascension, and of what is connected with each; and then I want to touch on His coming.<a name=168:4></a> Let me again remind you that we are speaking from John's gospel.<a name=168:5></a> The first mention of the Lord's resurrection is in chapter 2, when He went into the temple and found there the sellers of oxen and sheep, etc.<a name=168:6></a>, and He drove them out.<a name=168:7></a> Then they challenged Him to give them a sign, and He gives them a sign.<a name=168:8></a> He says, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up"; <i>that</i> was the sign.<a name=168:9></a> I would call your attention to the wonderful significance of that sign: "He spake of the temple of his body".<a name=168:10></a> His body as a Man here was the true temple of God -- of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit -- the trinity are presented in Him in John's gospel -- three divine persons.<a name=168:11></a> John bears witness (chapter 1: 32) of having seen the Spirit in the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		form of a dove descending upon Him, and the peculiar expression of John is -- "<i>it abode upon him</i>".<a name=169:1></a> One could quote a good many passages from this gospel where the Lord speaks of the Father dwelling in Him, and, beloved, He Himself in His own Person is there presented as the Son -- "the only-begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father"; so the truth is brought out that He was the temple of God, God dwelt in Him abidingly.<a name=169:2></a> With the exception of this passage (where He says, "Destroy this temple"), you find everywhere in John that His death is His <i>own act</i>: "No man", He said, speaking of His life as a Man here, "taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself".<a name=169:3></a> Again -- "I am the good shepherd.<a name=169:4></a> The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep".<a name=169:5></a> .<a name=169:6></a>.<a name=169:7></a>.<a name=169:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then -- as to His resurrection -- the first significance of it is that it is His own act; even in chapter 2 He says, "I will raise it up".<a name=169:9></a> It is in a sense the rebuilding of the temple of God.<a name=169:10></a> He laid down His life, but in resurrection He takes it again as Man; He takes it up in a condition perfectly suitable to all the purpose of God, and He takes it up, may I say, in a condition that places Him -- His precious body -- beyond all the reach of Man; He lives after the power of an endless life; death has no more dominion over Him.<a name=169:11></a> His body was the alone

		point where the enemy could touch Him; Satan persuaded himself that he would destroy Him by bringing His body into death, and that would end everything!<a name=170:1></a> But did it end everything?<a name=170:2></a> No; it was the beginning of the accomplishment of the eternal purpose of God.<a name=170:3></a> In it God was declared -- the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost were made known.<a name=170:4></a> Those Jews, led on by the enemy, might in a sense "destroy" His body, but they could not destroy the light of the revelation of God; that was beyond the power of the enemy to touch.<a name=170:5></a> He builds His body again, and He builds it in a condition that is indestructible, beyond the reach of man, and beyond the reach of death for ever.<a name=170:6></a> One would speak carefully and reverently; He died on the cross under the judgment of God.<a name=170:7></a> He died as Man; He cried, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?<a name=170:8></a>" Man nailed Him to the cross and heaped every indignity upon Him, and He bore the judgment of God; but in dying under the judgment of God He exhausted that judgment perfectly and for ever.<a name=170:9></a> He has built His body; He is raised from the dead.<a name=170:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there comes to light a very interesting thing in connection with the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ; you find Him risen in chapter 20, and with the exception of what He had to say to Mary personally, the first

		words that left His lips were "Go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God".<a name=171:1></a> But it is not His resurrection that has made us His brethren.<a name=171:2></a> Let me quote <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>"For both he that sanctifies and those sanctified are all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren" -- "all of one" -- of the same origin, derivation.<a name=171:3></a> Where did that take place?<a name=171:4></a> <i>In His death</i>.<a name=171:5></a> The "grain of wheat" fell into the ground and died, and in His death that took place which answers to what takes place in a grain of wheat which falls into the ground and dies.<a name=171:6></a> The many grains come forth, and so it is His death and not His resurrection that makes us His brethren.<a name=171:7></a> The term "brethren" involves our being "all of one".<a name=171:8></a> Before His death He was alone; now there are "many" who are of His nature as a Man, and the first thing that comes to pass in resurrection is that they are brought to light; He owns them; He recognises them; He says, "Go to my brethren".<a name=171:9></a> They will share all that belongs to Him, though that does not come about yet.<a name=171:10></a> He had been alone, but He is alone no more; He is still <i>the</i> heavenly One, but there are heavenly ones with Him now, the beginning of whose spiritual being was in His death, and they are brought to light in resurrection.<a name=171:11></a>

		There is another aspect of the Lord's resurrection in John.<a name=172:1></a> We find there two things as to the disciples -- the eleven; they are the Lord's disciples -- His peculiarly chosen ones, and we find them in association with Him.<a name=172:2></a> I am anticipating a little, for association is chiefly with the Lord in ascension, but we find them also in association with Him as risen, and though you may take account of them as in association with the Lord as risen, remember resurrection does not take anybody to heaven; I speak reverently, it did not take the Lord to heaven.<a name=172:3></a> Speaking of it in the broadest sense, resurrection is God's victory over death <i>down here</i>.<a name=172:4></a> In the moment that is coming, when "the dead in Christ shall rise first", God's victory over death will take place <i>down here</i>, where all the death, and all the sorrow has taken place, and in one moment the power of Christ will undo all that death has ever done for the saints of God.<a name=172:5></a> The resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ is the pledge and anticipation of blessing here upon earth, and God is going to return to that side for His earthly people; He is going by-and-by to take things up down here for blessing, and when He takes them up for blessing the order of God will be -- first, the remnant of Israel, and then the blessing will spread out, not only to the nations -- those particular nations found in prophecy connected

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I must pass on because I want to speak a little of His ascension -- I might have spoken more fully of resurrection if time had allowed, but I trust I have said enough, so that I shall not lie under the suspicion in any Christian's mind that we want to minify the resurrection, but it is clear that the terminus in John's gospel is <i>not</i> resurrection.<a name=173:5></a> Ascension is the terminus, because John presents Him as the divine Man, the second Man out of heaven; and the second Man out of heaven could not find His terminus (if I might use such an expression) in resurrection; although His ascension is not actually given in John -- his whole gospel is in the light of it.<a name=173:6></a> He says, "I came forth from the Father and have come into the world; again I leave the world and go to the Father".<a name=173:7></a> We might cite many such passages in this gospel, but I only note one more.<a name=173:8></a> In the message which He sends to His "brethren" in chapter 20 He says, "I ascend", so we are bound to take account of His ascension.<a name=173:9></a>

		Another point in connection with ascension is this -- I read from chapter 14 and also from chapter 16, and in chapter 16 the Lord positively declares that "It is profitable for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go I will send him to you".<a name=175:3></a> The coming of the Comforter did not depend merely upon His death or upon His resurrection; it depended on His ascension and glorification.<a name=175:4></a> In <a href="../bible/John.htm#7">John  7</a>we are told: "For the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified".<a name=175:5></a> So that the coming, and the abiding and indwelling presence of the Spirit of God stands connected with His ascension.<a name=175:6></a> I trust that is clear.<a name=175:7></a> I am sorry to pass over the points so briefly, because, in one sense, everything practically in Christianity hangs upon the abiding, indwelling presence of the Spirit of God.<a name=175:8></a> Christianity lies within the region or sphere of the Spirit of God; outside that sphere, in this city of London, vast as it is, there is not one bit of what God takes account of.<a name=175:9></a>

		scene brought before us in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>.<a name=176:1></a> We most of us understand Pentecost in a certain way; it was on the day of Pentecost that the Holy Ghost descended, but I do not know that we all understand what we get in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>.<a name=176:2></a> We find there that Mary Magdalene went with the message (to which we have referred) from the lips of the Lord; the "brethren" were together, and they received His message; so they were together not only in the light of His resurrection, but they were there in the light of what was involved in His words -- "I <i>ascend</i> to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God".<a name=176:3></a> On that day in the evening He appears in their midst, and the point I would refer to is this -- it says in our authorised version, "He breathed on them", but that is not right, "He breathed <i>into</i> them", and He says to them, "Receive Holy Spirit".<a name=176:4></a> It has generally been stated that in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>we have the divinely-given pattern of the assembly, not the assembly as coming together for the Lord's supper, or the breaking of bread as in 1 Corinthians, but a pattern of the assembly viewed spiritually, and viewed in relation to the heavenly privileges of the assembly .<a name=176:5></a>.<a name=176:6></a>.<a name=176:7></a> the Lord breathed into them and said, "Receive Holy Spirit".<a name=176:8></a> Now I think that in the light of the fact (of which we are pretty generally agreed), that <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>is a

		I am no scholar, but our brethren, who are scholars, tell us that the expression translated "only-begotten" has no thought of begetting in it, but that it means "only one", the same expression occurring in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#22">Genesis  22</a>, where God says to Abraham, "Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest".<a name=215:12></a> Whether in the Hebrew or the Greek, it is the identical expression that is translated in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:14">John  1:14</a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.P.<a name=221:2></a> I thought that we might proceed with the point we reached this afternoon in regard to our origin.<a name=221:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us look at the scripture which we read in <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4">Galatians  4</a>.<a name=221:4></a> It is an advance really upon chapter 3 -- the fact that we are all the sons of God by faith in Christ Jesus.<a name=221:5></a> We have seen that we could not be sons of God in connection with the flesh.<a name=221:6></a> But we might advance on that and say that we could not be regarded as sons of God in connection with our actual condition down here.<a name=221:7></a> Sonship could not be predicated of us <i>in</i> our actual condition.<a name=221:8></a> It <i>can</i> be predicated of us while our actual condition <i>remains</i>, but it could not be predicated of us <i>in</i> our actual condition.<a name=221:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in chapter 4 there is a further advance.<a name=221:10></a> "Because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father".<a name=221:11></a> That is the spirit of sonship.<a name=221:12></a> It is not only the present <i>light</i> of it in connection with faith, but there is the <i>spirit</i> of sonship.<a name=221:13></a> We are not <i>constituted</i> sons by the Spirit.<a name=221:14></a> It is because we <i>are</i> sons that God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Abba, Father.<a name=222:1></a> In connection with the Lord Himself it is very beautiful.<a name=222:2></a> The first time the expression "Abba, Father", occurs, it is as used by the Lord Himself in the garden of Gethsemane.<a name=222:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we may look at sonship as it affects us <i>here</i> and <i>now</i>.<a name=222:4></a> I think there is great instruction as to that in the Epistle to the Galatians.<a name=222:5></a> It is very striking and interesting to see how the Spirit of God, through the Apostle Paul, brings the truth of sonship to bear upon those Galatian saints.<a name=222:6></a> We are exposed to the working of leaven, not only in the Corinthian form, but in the Galatian form.<a name=222:7></a> It is a very subtle thing, and I think that, if we have been in any measure touched by leaven as it is presented in the Epistle to the Galatians, our recovery, our deliverance from it is by the spirit of sonship.<a name=222:8></a> The apostle brings in the <i>light</i> of sonship and the <i>spirit</i> of sonship.<a name=222:9></a> It was brought in for the deliverance and correction of the saints in Galatia.<a name=222:10></a> You remember how in that epistle the Spirit of God speaks of the Jerusalem which is down here, and what characterises those who are in any way connected with it is bondage.<a name=222:11></a> And in contrast to that we have the statement about "the Jerusalem above", which is our mother, and <i>free</i>.<a name=222:12></a> I suppose many of us, by virtue not only of our lifelong associations but perhaps the training we have been brought

		up under, would recoil from anything in the shape of the Corinthian leaven.<a name=223:1></a> But the leaven in Galatia had a distinctly religious character, and many of us, while on our guard against what is called immoral, might be taken in by leaven when it presents itself in a religions form.<a name=223:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a very beautiful illustration in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#17">Matthew  17</a>of how sonship works in this connection, and where Peter is asked the question, Does your Master pay tribute?<a name=223:3></a> Peter says, "Yes"; he thought a great deal of his Master.<a name=223:4></a> Then the Lord asks Peter the question -- when the kings of the earth levy tribute do they levy it on strangers or on their sons, and Peter had to say, "On strangers".<a name=223:5></a> The idea of the king's sons paying tribute!<a name=223:6></a> And the Lord answers, "Then are the sons free".<a name=223:7></a> That shows that sonship sets the soul in perfect liberty, and it is liberty connected with <i>Christ</i>.<a name=223:8></a> In Galatians he says further on: "Christ has set us free in freedom; stand fast therefore, and be not held again in a yoke of bondage".<a name=223:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In connection with the statement that when some heard Him say certain things they were ready to take the place of being His disciples, the Lord said: "If ye continue [or abide] in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed [or truly]; and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free".<a name=223:10></a> If you read the text you will find
