		In <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1">Revelation  1</a>- 3, we have what might be called the Captain of the Lord's host coming very distinctly and marvellously into view in connection with His church militant.<a name=1:1></a> There is no question at all to my mind that the Lord takes up that character.<a name=1:2></a> There had been those set responsibly in connection with the assembly, and the assembly (so to speak) had been put in possession: it had been established, and it was set up in connection with what was to be held for God here.<a name=1:3></a> But who was to maintain it?<a name=1:4></a> And so, as the apostles connected with the foundation were finally passing off the scene; it is inexpressibly strengthening and encouraging, it fills one with a sense of courage and calmness, to see the Lord Himself coming upon the ground, as we have it in chapter 1, covered as He is with all the marks, all the qualities, everything that distinguishes Him as the power of God, sufficient to carry right through the ages until the final moment.<a name=1:5></a> We need have no fear that things are going to break down in the hands of the Captain of the Lord's host.<a name=1:6></a> One can easily understand what bewilderment, what puzzlement,

		what embarrassment there would be if we had to face all the ruin, all the confusion there is, and had no certain light upon it.<a name=2:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is to my mind nothing more perfect, nothing more wonderful than these two chapters in which the Lord takes up and sketches out every bit of strength and weakness, of corruption and purity, and gives the whole view from beginning to end of what would be in the responsible vessel from the time of the departure of the apostle until the time of the return of the Lord.<a name=2:2></a> There is absolutely nothing that has happened in the history of the assembly, or that is happening under our eyes today, that is not fully and succinctly laid open for us to look and see; and then to contemplate in connection with each phase, the Captain of the Lord's host coming in to give His people, in that day, under those circum-stances and with all those surroundings, that courage, that strength, that phase or aspect of the truth that will enable them to stand as the Lord's host.<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, if we look in connection with what we have around us today, there are just two things that we note: that is, there are two voices that never cease until the time of the return of the Lord.<a name=2:4></a> The one is the voice of the blessed Lord Himself when He speaks to the faithful remnant in Thyatira; when He speaks to what is left in that deadened condition of Sardis; when He takes account with His own sweet and precious estimate of all that is divine and
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		glowing in Philadelphia; and recognises the faithful ones that there are in Laodicea.<a name=3:1></a> He has His voice - His word - for each one in each surrounding, with its own peculiar fitness for what every saint of God may need at the particular moment.<a name=3:2></a> That is one voice.<a name=3:3></a> We touch all those things today, what is in Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, Laodicea, we cannot escape; we are in touch with all those things.<a name=3:4></a> What an immense thing it is to have our ears opened to the voice that speaks in connection with all; to get His estimate, to get His resources, to get His wisdom, His sufficiency, His power - and the assurance of the victory that comes in connection with the Captain of the Lord's host.<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But yet there is another voice, and what voice is that?<a name=3:6></a> The other voice speaks in a different character, though in connection with the Lord Himself walking in the midst of the assemblies.<a name=3:7></a> The Lord indicates beforehand what is coming on them.<a name=3:8></a> The journey has all been before His sight; every age, every aspect has all been foreseen; so that the man of faith, the man of God, need never be at a loss, for the Lord has indicated it all and has spoken the word beforehand that is needed for that moment and that aspect of things.<a name=3:9></a> There is another voice, however, and what is that voice?<a name=3:10></a> It is the voice of the <i>Spirit</i>.<a name=3:11></a> "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies".<a name=3:12></a> And what does the Spirit say?<a name=3:13></a> It does not tell us specifically.<a name=3:14></a> We are told what the Lord says.<a name=3:15></a> The Lord will say, for

		instance, in connection with Thyatira, "To the angel of the assembly in Thyatira write: These things says the Son of God, he that has his eyes as a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass: I know thy works", etc.<a name=4:1></a> To Sardis He says, "These things saith he that has the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars: I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead".<a name=4:2></a> To Philadelphia He speaks the words I have read to you.<a name=4:3></a> And to Laodicea He says, "And to the angel of the assembly in Laodicea write: These things says the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God".<a name=4:4></a> The voice is definite, is specific, and fits the moment.<a name=4:5></a> Take Laodicea, when everything is carried away - the witness is gone, so to speak.<a name=4:6></a> But the faithful and true witness, He has never altered; His power has never failed; and thus He presents Himself to us at the last moment.<a name=4:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies".<a name=4:8></a> Here, I believe, beloved brethren, is where all the breakdown and all the ruin in Christendom has come in.<a name=4:9></a> It has failed to hear the voice of the Spirit, giving the truth of the time, for the time in all the history of the church when it was needed.<a name=4:10></a> The Spirit, so to speak, does not give the voice beforehand; He does not indicate in the same way as the Lord beforehand; but He is here all the time, and, as each new condition comes about, He is prepared, He knows the mind of the Lord; He has perfectly the whole scope of the work

		and the need - what is called for by the assembly at each particular occasion.<a name=5:1></a> The Spirit has an attentive ear and a sympathetic heart for each moment.<a name=5:2></a> It is the people that are breathed upon who are the people that are standing (<a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#37:10">Ezekiel  37:10</a>).<a name=5:3></a> What is the word with which the Lord closes each address?<a name=5:4></a> "He that overcomes".<a name=5:5></a> The Lord knows what He holds in His hand.<a name=5:6></a> It may be a mere handful, but the Lord is going to have His men to stand right on to the end.<a name=5:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We need have no discouragement at all about them; the Lord will have His overcomers.<a name=5:8></a> Christendom may drift on the billows of Thyatira, with her revolting alliance with the powers of evil; but the Lord has those that "overcome", and He intends that in the kingdom that is coming, He will give the exact recompense of reward to the overcomer for that which he has had to encounter in his day and generation.<a name=5:9></a> It is perfectly wonderful, perfectly beautiful, to see how the Captain of the Lord's host keeps account and speaks in a voice that every consecrated ear can listen to - and recompense is coming to all in the kingdom.<a name=5:10></a> What is overcoming?<a name=5:11></a> Standing, and having done all, to stand.<a name=5:12></a> Overcomers are men that are breathed into, men that are able to stand shoulder to shoulder and men that are able to keep rank, men that the Lord can take account of as men of God.<a name=5:13></a> The drifting goes on, but they stand; the testimony of the Lord is upheld.<a name=5:14></a> Yesterday, the truth stressed may have been justification by faith; today, it may be truth as to

		the body of Christ, the assembly of God, the house of God, the kingdom, the coming of the Lord or some other aspect.<a name=6:1></a> All these things in themselves were just as true one thousand years ago, five hundred years ago, as they are today.<a name=6:2></a> But why do we hear these things now?<a name=6:3></a> They are the voice of the Spirit, truth for the time, what the Spirit is saying to the assemblies.<a name=6:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We cannot take any settled articles of faith; we cannot take a creed, a crystallised confession, and say, 'Here, I will stand upon these dogmas, I will stand upon these truths'.<a name=6:5></a> The Spirit today does not direct us alone to the truth that was brought out a hundred years ago; but the voice of the Spirit is different in its tone, and He is bringing into view truth in connection with the place and power and kingdom of Christ.<a name=6:6></a> What do you need in order to get the mind of the Spirit?<a name=6:7></a> You must have the circumcised ear; you must have an exercised heart, and you will get enlightenment as to the course of things around and the Lord's judgment of it all.<a name=6:8></a> We need the whole armour of God, that we may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand.<a name=6:9></a> He makes a great deal of the overcomer.<a name=6:10></a> In Thyatira, with its pretensions; in Sardis, with its deadness, formality and rationalism, drifting off into infidelity - His voice is to the overcomer.<a name=6:11></a> But to Philadelphia - responsive to what is suitable to Him - He promises a wealth of recompense in that coming age for what He has found in the saints

		In the scripture which I have read, I think you get principles that obtain and stand in relation to the condition of things in which we are found today; and I think, furthermore, you get brought before you, in figure, what has been before us a good deal in our meetings, - the great value God places on our affection for Christ, and our privilege as His people to be down here in the way of testimony, seeking to maintain what is of Himself in this world.<a name=9:1></a> It was a very solemn time in the history of God's earthly people.<a name=9:2></a> A usurper was on the throne.<a name=9:3></a> Athaliah's son had been slain - it was of the Lord that he should be slain - and she had usurped the kingdom.<a name=9:4></a> She was a daughter of Ahab, and she bore the unmistakable traces of the one from whom she sprang.<a name=9:5></a> I suppose the fact of a woman being in evidence is indicative of a subjective state.<a name=9:6></a> It was a state of apostasy, and things could not have been much darker, and it must have been a source of grief to every godly man in the kingdom to see Athaliah on the throne.<a name=9:7></a> When she saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal seed.<a name=9:8></a> How suggestive this is of what we find today.<a name=9:9></a> On every hand you can see the effort of the enemy

		to obliterate everything that is of God.<a name=10:1></a> We are made more and more conscious of it, as time goes on, that with untiring malignity the enemy is set, and will be set to the end, to obliterate every vestige of what is of and for God in this world.<a name=10:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But we know that every move of the enemy only gives an opportunity for God to work and to show what He can do.<a name=10:3></a> If we find a woman in evidence in connection with what was opposed to God, on the other hand we find a woman who had real appreciation of what was of God, and it is encouraging to see, in the midst of the general departure, that God took care that there were those who were formed according to His mind, and who were qualified to maintain what was of Himself for the moment.<a name=10:4></a> Here it is that Jehosheba comes to the front.<a name=10:5></a> She was the wife of Jehoiada the high priest.<a name=10:6></a> It is not always that a woman takes character from her husband, but it is a happy thing when she does so according to God.<a name=10:7></a> The church should take character from Christ.<a name=10:8></a> Jehosheba had evidently drunk into the spirit of her husband, whose duty it was to maintain the people in relationship with God, and his wife was in accord with him.<a name=10:9></a> It is only as we catch the Spirit of Christ that we can come out here for God and maintain what is of Him and for Him in this scene.<a name=10:10></a> What did she do?<a name=10:11></a> She had divine sensibilities; she had light from God and knew what was precious to Him, and she appreciated it.<a name=10:12></a> She had courage too.<a name=10:13></a> She stole Joash from among the

		God's eye was on that child.<a name=11:3></a> He was only a babe of a year old at the time, and everything in connection with him spoke of weakness and insignificance, but he was destined to exert a mighty influence for God in the land.<a name=11:4></a> This woman fed and nurtured and tended that babe, and he grew under her hand, and in doing this she undoubtedly had divine support.<a name=11:5></a> Now I think that babe sets forth the testimony of God.<a name=11:6></a> If you speak of the testimony now - it all centres in Christ - what does the world think about it?<a name=11:7></a> Nothing!<a name=11:8></a> It has not a bit of interest in it.<a name=11:9></a> It is beneath its notice as being too insignificant.<a name=11:10></a> It may be treasured by those who have an appreciation of God, but outwardly it is in its babyhood.<a name=11:11></a> But a day is coming when it shall come into evidence and all will have to take account of it, and then those who have been true to Christ and have nurtured what is of Himself in the day of His rejection - in the day of small things - will be publicly justified.<a name=11:12></a> The day of manifestation is certainly coming.<a name=11:13></a>

		Well, time passed on and in the seventh year Jehoiada took those who were responsible - "the captains of the hundreds, of the body guard and the couriers" - and brought them into the house of Jehovah and made a covenant with them and showed them the king's son.<a name=12:4></a> Ah!<a name=12:5></a> dear friends, there is often quite a period elapsing between the moment of our learning Christ as a Saviour and as the King's Son.<a name=12:6></a> We have, I trust, learned Him as the One who came in wondrous grace and met all our deep need as sinners.<a name=12:7></a> We have tasted that the Lord is gracious and have proven His priestly care in connection with the difficulties of the pathway.<a name=12:8></a> But, blessed as that may be, there is something more wonderful than that.<a name=12:9></a> It is this.<a name=12:10></a> Did you ever get a sight of the King's Son?<a name=12:11></a> Did you ever see Christ, not in His relation to you and me, but in relation to God?<a name=12:12></a>

		God, but that name makes you think at once of the peculiar relationship in which He stands, as Man, to God.<a name=13:1></a> At the annunciation, we are told He was to be called Son of God.<a name=13:2></a> At His baptism by John and at the transfiguration, you hear the Father's voice, as He looks down with infinite delight on that blessed Man and says, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#3:17">Matthew  3:17</a>).<a name=13:3></a> Every thought of God is wrapped up in Him and He is going to give effect to every counsel and purpose of God.<a name=13:4></a> He will flood the whole universe with the light of God and awaken in the heart of every intelligent creature a suited response to that.<a name=13:5></a> Think of the greatness of <i>that Person</i>.<a name=13:6></a> As God looked upon Him and saw the immense moral results that were going to flow from Him, well might He say as He contemplated Him with perfect satisfaction - "My Beloved".<a name=13:7></a> As we heard last night, "Behold my servant whom I uphold, mine elect in whom my soul delighteth!<a name=13:8></a>" (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#42:1">Isaiah  42:1</a>).<a name=13:9></a>

		I want to come to a narrower circle than that, however.<a name=13:10></a> The Son of God has been pleased to take us into association with Himself now.<a name=13:11></a> "Me and thee" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#17:27">Matthew  17:27</a>).<a name=13:12></a> Oh!<a name=13:13></a> beloved brethren, the more we appreciate the greatness of His Person, the more shall we appreciate the greatness of that love which has been pleased to take us into association with Himself.<a name=13:14></a> I think Peter learned that.<a name=13:15></a> What was it that Peter saw, as recorded in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#14">Matthew  14</a>, when he was in the boat?<a name=13:16></a> He saw a Man walking on the

		water.<a name=14:1></a> That was something new, a new order of Man; something outside of nature, beyond human ken, walking on a storm-tossed sea.<a name=14:2></a> There He was, superior to every adverse power in this world, and He filled the vision of Peter's soul, who says, "Lord, if it be <i>thou</i>, command me to come to thee upon the waters" (verse 28).<a name=14:3></a> Peter had such an appreciation of His greatness that he felt He could enable him to walk there too and that His love would have him there, and when he gets the word, "Come", he responds at once and joins the Lord on the water.<a name=14:4></a> There are two walking there now.<a name=14:5></a> That is association.<a name=14:6></a> There was One great enough to sustain Peter above all the power of the enemy which is directed against God's people.<a name=14:7></a> Not only had Peter tasted that the Lord was gracious, but he had come to Him as the Living Stone.<a name=14:8></a> He saw what He was as refused here, "cast away indeed as worthless by men, but with God chosen, precious" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:4">1 Peter  2:4</a>).<a name=14:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You have seen a builder pick up a stone, examine it and cast it away.<a name=14:10></a> He could not use it.<a name=14:11></a> That is what the world thought about Christ.<a name=14:12></a> But Peter learned, if not at that moment at any rate subsequently, what He was to God - chosen, precious - and he comes to Him, the Son of God, the Living Stone, and learns something of what it is to be before the Father in the preciousness of the Son.<a name=14:13></a> In that way he is built up, formed suitably for conscious association and for a place in that wonderful structure, the spiritual house, where all is

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I think the scripture I read gives you something of this moral order.<a name=15:5></a> First Jehoiada "shewed them the king's son", and then he made provision for guarding his person and for the protection of the house of the Lord.<a name=15:6></a> It was a wonderful answer to devotedness, for I judge those thus charged with responsibility were characterised by the spirit of Jehosheba, and their promotion was morally suitable.<a name=15:7></a> They were to "encompass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand", and to be "with the king" as he went out and as he came in.<a name=15:8></a> Their privilege was to be in nearness to the king, and witnesses of his various activities, and they were to guard his person from every enemy.<a name=15:9></a> If we have learned God's thought in regard to Christ, what greater favour can we enjoy than to be near Him, in complete moral accord with Him,

		and to be intelligent as to His gracious activities!<a name=16:1></a> Do you think, if we love Christ, that we would tolerate any indignity directed at His blessed Person?<a name=16:2></a> We should be very sensitive as to what was due to Him.<a name=16:3></a> In the case of Joash, if any man came within the ranks he was to be slain.<a name=16:4></a> That man meant mischief to the king.<a name=16:5></a> So while we would ever seek to maintain the spirit of grace, there is no quarter to be shown to any man who would insidiously or openly direct an attack at the blessed Son of God.<a name=16:6></a> You would not receive such an one into your house nor salute him.<a name=16:7></a> Neither would we be indifferent as to the circle of His interests.<a name=16:8></a> We would guard the house that it be not broken down.<a name=16:9></a> It might be difficult to locate God's house today, because things are broken outwardly, but it is still here.<a name=16:10></a> Moreover, if you can find any who, in weakness, are seeking to maintain what is of God, you would stand with them shoulder to shoulder.<a name=16:11></a>

		In a world where the enemy is ever active, I do not think we could have a greater privilege than to be "with the king", and having a share in such a blessed service.<a name=16:12></a> But while it is a privilege, it involves conflict.<a name=16:13></a> Not that we would miss the conflict, for His support in it is abundant compensation, but every heart that is true to Christ must at times long for the moment when the conflict will be over, and when Christ will come out in all His power and glory and dispossess the enemy.<a name=16:14></a> This is beautifully set forth in the action of the high

	<div class="paragraph">
		I take it for granted that most of those present here tonight are Christians, some of them with a large measure of light, and it will be no new thought when I say that from the moment sin entered into this world, God was working in view of another world.<a name=19:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When God created, or set in order this world, He placed a man over it.<a name=19:2></a> That man was intended to be representative and descriptive of Him - to be His image and glory - but he failed at the outset, and death as the judgment of God passed on that man and the world with which he was connected.<a name=19:3></a> Now another world comes into view - the world to come - and regarding that world, God works inversely.<a name=19:4></a> He first of all finds a Man whom He can trust, and that is His well-beloved Son, a Man after His own heart, who should fulfil all His will.<a name=19:5></a> He is tested in every way in the furnace of affliction.<a name=19:6></a> Satan and men are allowed to do their utmost against Him.<a name=19:7></a> He is tried in public and in private, but there is no turning aside, and even at the supreme moment on the cross, when for sin He was subjected to the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		judgment of God, He never failed to maintain as a Man all that was due in devoted obedience to God.<a name=20:1></a> But more than that, He showed Himself perfectly competent to deal with all the evil that had entered the first creation and to bring to pass an order of things in which God should have His pleasure.<a name=20:2></a> To that end He died and rose again.<a name=20:3></a> In His death, man after the flesh and the world system which that man, as energised by Satan, had constructed, were judged.<a name=20:4></a> Death, too, and he who had the power of it, were annulled, and in that very spot where this was accomplished, all that God is in His attributes and nature came into evidence.<a name=20:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the One in whom all this has come to pass is risen, and has gone to God's right hand, and in Him God has established in resurrection, a world for His own pleasure, which Christ will fill with the light and glory of God.<a name=20:6></a> That world is not yet to be seen as a matter of display, but it will be brought into evidence at the coming of the Lord.<a name=20:7></a> In the meantime it is there for faith, and the Holy Spirit having come from that glorified Man, it may now be known and enjoyed in the power of the Spirit.<a name=20:8></a> I think that is plainly inferred in this Scripture, where, although the world to come is mentioned but once, you get several references to the kingdom of God, because in the kingdom you get now every moral element that will obtain when the world to come is publicly displayed.<a name=20:9></a>

		In the Scripture that I read, these two worlds are brought strikingly before us.<a name=21:1></a> The young ruler (see <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#19:22">Matthew  19:22</a> and <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#18:18">Luke  18:18</a>) moved in reference to the one, and the disciples in reference to the other.<a name=21:2></a> Possibly you have noticed that in each gospel where the incident of the young ruler is mentioned, it is prefaced by the account of the bringing of young children to Jesus that he might touch them.<a name=21:3></a> I think the connection is exceedingly beautiful.<a name=21:4></a> We are not told who brought them.<a name=21:5></a> I suppose it was the parents, and it was eminently fitting that <i>they</i> should do so.<a name=21:6></a> I should judge that every right-minded parent would desire to bring his children to Jesus.<a name=21:7></a> You may ask what is implied by their desiring Him to touch them.<a name=21:8></a> I think they wanted Him to put His blessed impress upon them.<a name=21:9></a> There was not a bit of worldly ambition in that.<a name=21:10></a> If you are ambitious for your children to shine in this world, do not bring them to Jesus to touch them.<a name=21:11></a> You will only meet with disappointment if you do.<a name=21:12></a> He will touch them, but He will impress them with that which is of value to the Father, with those moral qualities which will be approved in the world to come.<a name=21:13></a> He will put His own beauty upon them, a beauty which will be appreciated in the Father's world.<a name=21:14></a> But "the disciples rebuked those that brought them;" the Lord was much displeased and said unto them, "Suffer the little children to come to me; forbid them not; for of such is the kingdom of God".<a name=21:15></a> He saw in them a pattern of those who are

	<div class="paragraph">
		suitable for the kingdom.<a name=22:1></a> A little child is not of much importance in this world.<a name=22:2></a> It has no vote, and its name even would not appear in our directories.<a name=22:3></a> It has no place in the commercial or political world, and if it dies, little heed is paid to it.<a name=22:4></a> But there <i>is</i> a circle where it occupies a very large place, and that is in the family, and in the affections of the father.<a name=22:5></a> And, depend upon it, if the Lord touches any, it will not be to give them prominence here but to give them a place in His own circle.<a name=22:6></a> Mark what He did, "And having taken them in his arms, having laid his hands on them, he blessed them".<a name=22:7></a> That shows they were very little; indeed they are called "infants" in one scripture.<a name=22:8></a> I wonder if you would like the Lord to do that for you?<a name=22:9></a> The heart could not conceive of a greater favour, and if you are content to be little and of no account here, He <i>will</i> do it for you.<a name=22:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In this scripture we read of a young ruler coming to Jesus to enquire the way of life.<a name=22:11></a> There is something very interesting in the exercises of a young person.<a name=22:12></a> This one was eminently qualified to enjoy life in this world, and doubtless the world was very attractive to him.<a name=22:13></a> He evidently held some position of honour, and his ample fortune would enable him to grace it, for he was very rich.<a name=22:14></a> Moreover he had youth on his side.<a name=22:15></a> He was moral, too, and courteous, for he kneeled to the Lord, and he was earnest, for he came running.<a name=22:16></a> There was a great deal that was attractive about him, and Jesus beholding him loved him.<a name=22:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=23>[Page 23]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This young man was evidently in exercise.<a name=23:1></a> With all that he had to make life happy, there was no permanency to it.<a name=23:2></a> He realised that death was here, and the more qualified a man is to enjoy life, the more terrible does death appear, and his question, "Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?<a name=23:3></a>" told only too plainly what his exercises were.<a name=23:4></a> Evidently he hoped in some way to be able to retain life in this world.<a name=23:5></a> Though he addressed the Lord as "Good Teacher", he was ignorant as to the true character of the One he was addressing, as well as of the truth concerning himself.<a name=23:6></a> If he had hoped to be able to claim life on the ground of his goodness, that hope must have been shattered by the Lord's answer, "No one is good but One, that is God".<a name=23:7></a> Manifestly then, he was a sinner, and as such had forfeited life here.<a name=23:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the law might hold out some hope for him, for it promised long life (not eternal life) to the obedient.<a name=23:9></a> So the Lord directs him to the second half of the ten commandments.<a name=23:10></a> Could he meet its requirements?<a name=23:11></a> Alas, that, too, failed him.<a name=23:12></a> As to the breach of any overt act, he was blameless, but it discovered in him, as it did with Saul of Tarsus, the very principle which it condemned.<a name=23:13></a> Lacking the one thing which the law demanded - love - that essential quality for the Father's world, it discovered in him, underneath all that beautiful exterior, that dreadful principle of lust - of covetousness - which ruined this world, and which
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=24>[Page 24]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		is the ruling principle of man after the flesh.<a name=24:1></a> Similarly the law found one point of attack in Saul, and it struck him in that vulnerable point: as he says, "I was alive without law once; but the commandment having come, sin revived, but I died.<a name=24:2></a> And the commandment, which was for life, was found, as to me, itself to be unto death" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#7:9">Romans  7:9</a>, 10).<a name=24:3></a> He found it was all over with him on that ground.<a name=24:4></a> Death must do its work.<a name=24:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The same thing was true with this young ruler, and it is so with every man, and it is wisdom to face it.<a name=24:6></a> In spite of this, the heart of this young ruler clung to the world from which death must soon separate him for ever.<a name=24:7></a> It was a bitter thing for his spirit to have thus to face the truth, but it was the Lord who loved him who thus undeceived him.<a name=24:8></a> Had this world been according to God the Lord would Himself have remained in it, and have put honour upon it and those who belonged to it, but it was a world of lust and pride, a world in which that blessed, lowly Man had no place, and He virtually says to this young man, 'I cannot hold out any hopes for you as regards this world; I cannot reinstate you here and I would not if I could.<a name=24:9></a> There is no room for Me here, but I am going to a world where I shall be everything - the Father's world - and I will give you a place there if you have any appreciation of Me, for nothing but what is of Me can enter there'.<a name=24:10></a> "Go, sell whatever thou hast and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in

		heaven; and come, follow me, taking up the cross".<a name=25:1></a> That is the way the Lord was going and He speaks of heaven, of a cross, and of following Him.<a name=25:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But man after the flesh has no appreciation of that.<a name=25:3></a> He clings to earth and present glory, and the thought of following One who was in reproach and about to leave the world by a cross of shame was intolerable.<a name=25:4></a> Do you wonder that he was sad?<a name=25:5></a> It says, "But he, sad at the word, went away grieved, for he had large possessions".<a name=25:6></a> It was a death-blow to all that he was naturally and yet it was the only answer the Lord could give to his question; and it was the only way into life.<a name=25:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And Jesus looked around about him and said unto His disciples, "How difficultly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!<a name=25:8></a>" The disciples were astonished at his words, and again He said unto them, "How difficult it is that those who trust in riches should enter into the kingdom of God!<a name=25:9></a>" What do riches do for a man?<a name=25:10></a> They give him a status in this world, an importance in the estimation of others, and to this the heart of man clings tenaciously.<a name=25:11></a> So the Lord further added, "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God".<a name=25:12></a> This astonished the disciples out of measure, and they say, "And who can be saved?<a name=25:13></a>" The Lord tells them it was a natural impossibility, but with God all things are possible.<a name=25:14></a> God could make a camel to go through a needle's eye, but it would

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But God is going to fill His world with those who have an appreciation of Christ and who take character from Him.<a name=26:5></a> How is He going to bring this about?<a name=26:6></a> He does it by presenting all His thoughts of grace and all His counsels of love to us in Christ.<a name=26:7></a> He delights to occupy our hearts with that blessed Person and our minds with that world which He is going to fill.<a name=26:8></a> Thus Christ and His world become attractive to us and we are prepared to go the way that He has gone so as to be with Him.<a name=26:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Peter tells the secret, "Behold, <i>we</i> have left all things and have followed thee", adding, as another gospel reads, "What then shall happen to us?<a name=26:10></a>" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#19:27">Matthew  19:27</a>).<a name=26:11></a> You may say the disciples had legal thoughts still.<a name=26:12></a> It is true, but nevertheless they dearly loved the Lord and had left everything so as to be in His blessed company, He was attractive to them and they loved Him better than anything else.<a name=26:13></a> Does He thus appeal to your heart?<a name=26:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You get another beautiful example of it in Saul of Tarsus.<a name=26:15></a> What a transformation came over that bitter persecutor on the way to Damascus and afterwards.<a name=26:16></a> I think he had a great appreciation of himself up to that time, for he had never till then met as good a man as himself.<a name=26:17></a> He, too, had great

	<div class="paragraph">
		But I think we can view this morally also, and it presents to us a still greater thought.<a name=28:6></a> For those who have left houses or brethren or lands for His sake and the gospel's, He promises a hundredfold now in this present time and, in the world to come, life eternal.<a name=28:7></a> I suppose a house furnishes protection from the elements.<a name=28:8></a> Do you think He will fail to provide those that love Him with abundant protection from the hostile influences that obtain in this world?<a name=28:9></a> Or if, for the truth's sake, you have to suffer the loss of those who are near to you in the ties of nature, He will not fail to raise up those who stand in a closer relationship to you than any earthly friends, so that you will always have company, and those with whom you can be in close and happy association.<a name=28:10></a> And if it came to you having to forsake your land, as that which ministered substance to you, so that you have no foothold here in a material way, He will feed you with the fatness

		I would connect Sardis with Thyatira because, so far as I see, the elements are virtually the same, the elements of the world, but not so much in the aspect of apostasy as that deadly paralysis of rationalism, the exercise of man's will and man's judgment which has come in to put its chilling influence on that which presumes to call itself by the name of Christ.<a name=34:2></a> He says, "Thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead".<a name=34:3></a> But even there He discerns that which He can recognise in a way and perhaps we can find a little parallel in the day of Esther, the day in which the living God has disappeared from sight.<a name=34:4></a> It is the book in which the name of God is not even mentioned and truly it might be said, they had a name to live and were dead, yet God acted behind the scenes and held His hand upon that which He knew and recognised as of Himself.<a name=34:5></a>

		This epistle has been in my thoughts of late because of its peculiar character, as no other epistle, so far as I know, has at all the same distinct elements in it.<a name=53:1></a> A brother said to me in connection with our readings, the profit of which has been felt by all of us, what does this effect?<a name=53:2></a> This suggested to me this epistle, as bringing out the thought that what has been before us in figure, in connection with David, as setting forth Christ and the sphere of things which He dominates in power, grace and blessing, together with the effect that is produced, is very largely illustrated by the one who wrote this epistle.<a name=53:3></a> You will note that it is what you would call an individual epistle.<a name=53:4></a> It does not take up assembly truth as such, and another thing one notices in connection with it is that it is not a corrective epistle; it is not written to set right things that are wrong, but on the contrary, the whole epistle from beginning to end breathes the most beautiful spirit of one who is thoroughly content, absolutely at rest, who has no unsolved questions or unsatisfied desires.<a name=53:5></a> This suggests that the line of truth the Spirit of God is bringing out to us is intended to have a formative effect in the soul and spirit, so that

		One is free to say that as a general thing one does not find a great amount of rest and thorough satisfaction amongst the saints.<a name=54:2></a> Why is it?<a name=54:3></a> It is a fact that I am sure must have often impressed us, that looking at Christians in general, when it is not a question of the forgiveness of sins, or of peace with God, or of the assurance of reaching heaven when the whole of the story is over, they are not <i>restful</i>.<a name=54:4></a> There may be no misgivings as to one's soul's salvation, but when it comes to the practical, experimental side of things, there is a great deal of unrest and pressure, instead of the peaceable fruits of righteousness.<a name=54:5></a> So one turns to the epistle to the Philippians, for the reason that the Spirit of God, I think, never brings before us truth objectively without giving us an example in a living person, of the way in which that truth works out, if one is disposed to be really subject to the Spirit.<a name=54:6></a> Now that is what one finds in the man who wrote this epistle.<a name=54:7></a> He is a man who has graduated in the school of God and has taken his degree.<a name=54:8></a> About such a man there is nothing that is forced or unnatural; so that like effects will be produced in those who are ready to follow along the same path with all that it involves; and therein lies the problem, because it is a path which is not pleasant to the flesh; it is losing one's life in this world, but finding it to life eternal.<a name=54:9></a>

		So, if one takes up Paul's ministry, it is profoundly interesting to see the line along which the Spirit of God gives it.<a name=55:1></a> If we look at the way in which Paul is taken up, one sees that it is deeply suggestive; there seems no question but that he is the moral successor to Stephen, who was full of the Holy Spirit, and who "fixed his eyes on heaven" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7:55">Acts  7:55</a>).<a name=55:2></a> Stephen saw, through the fulness of the Spirit, and the fulness of faith, as he looked steadfastly into heaven, a system of glory which centred around the Son of man.<a name=55:3></a> That was Stephen's vision.<a name=55:4></a> He "<i>saw</i> the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God", and his testimony was to the Son of man.<a name=55:5></a> Now the term Son of man brings before us a sphere of glory of His own.<a name=55:6></a> As Man, God has put into His hands the gathering of everything together, and the administration of everything in blessing, the ordering of a realm which shall be wholly in harmony with the mind of God.<a name=55:7></a> The witness to the universe that God was right when He purposed in His counsels to put things into the hand of Man to be administered.<a name=55:8></a> Such administration can produce the highest effects of blessing and the perfection of administration, glory and order.<a name=55:9></a> So Stephen's point of view is that he saw the glory of God connected with the Son of man who has that order of things in His hands to bring about, which continues until eventually He delivers up the kingdom to God, even the Father, and God is all in all.<a name=55:10></a> The witnesses of

		Stephen's martyrdom brought their garments and laid them down at the feet of a young man whose name was Saul; and what we find in the next chapter (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#8">Acts  8</a>) is a sort of link through the Ethiopian, to whom the testimony is brought of One whose life is taken from the earth.<a name=56:1></a> Stephen's life is taken from the earth, following on in the way of the blessed Lord whose life was taken away; and the eunuch says, "Behold water; what hinders my being baptised?<a name=56:2></a>" Thus in figure morally his life is taken from the earth as Stephen's life was taken actually.<a name=56:3></a> Stephen was absent from the body and present with the Lord, and, as passed away from this earth, he ceased to be available as a living testimony for the Lord.<a name=56:4></a> Yet what is wanted here is that living testimony for the Lord, which is found in a man whose life morally has gone from the earth, which is suggested to us by the eunuch's baptism, showing that he is ready to grasp the light that is put before him, that his life should be taken from the earth as following Jesus.<a name=56:5></a> It is characteristic that we hear no more of him after he goes on his way rejoicing; he disappears from view.<a name=56:6></a> Then Saul on his way to Damascus sees the glory, and begins at the point where Stephen left off.<a name=56:7></a> The Lord speaks to him from the glory, and Saul comes forth endowed with the garments of witness from Stephen's death.<a name=56:8></a> The witnesses had brought the garments and laid them down at his feet, and in chapter 9 Saul has taken such up and put them on, as it were, and he comes

		Now the line of his testimony in doctrine develops in the same way.<a name=57:3></a> As we have heard this afternoon, in the epistle to the Romans we have the way of righteousness opened up, and what Paul was led to set forth as doctrine eminently characterised Paul's life as a man.<a name=57:4></a> He was wholly recovered to righteousness.<a name=57:5></a> What he was as a man in flesh had ceased to characterise or control him in any way.<a name=57:6></a> He had lost his life in this world, and now what he sets before the saints in the epistle to the Romans is that which characterised him in the manner of his life and his walk.<a name=57:7></a> It comes out in the Acts and in his epistles.<a name=57:8></a> One does not need to inquire what sort of a man he was, because in his measure, and allowing for the frailty of the flesh, what he <i>said</i>, that he <i>was</i>.<a name=57:9></a>

		If it be the standpoint of Ephesians, which reaches up to the heavenly places, there was nothing that hindered Paul, and therefore he reaches into all the counsels of God that have been set forth in connection with Christ glorified, and we see him moulded into conformity to the truth in that epistle also.<a name=58:5></a> With regard to Stephen, it was requisite, in order that we might see the effect produced in a man, and how far the power of it could go, that he should actually pass out of this scene; but with regard to Paul, who followed, as it were, along the same lines in connection with the Lord's sphere of

		If we turn to chapter 2, we have a manner of spirit brought before us which is most beautiful, "Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus" (verse 5).<a name=61:9></a> Would that one had time to dwell upon it in all its sweet and precious details, which Paul brings before us, presenting the manner of spirit that came out in Christ Jesus, in His patient service going down even unto death.<a name=61:10></a> Then the Spirit of God brings before us, in connection with Paul, and Timothy, and Epaphroditus (that by the mouth

		Then if we turn to the third chapter we come into the greatness of resurrection: "To know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being conformed to his death, if any way I arrive at the resurrection from among the dead" (verses 10, 11).<a name=62:8></a> Here was a man with lineage, with learning, with political position, with influence and everything of that sort, who says, 'I have left all these things and thrown them away as refuse'.<a name=62:9></a> Now the object that was before his soul and which shines out in this wondrous light from that prison in Rome was, "To know him, and the power

		if anything practical is to be the outcome of it, it is that the Spirit of God would bring before us that we are connected with an exceedingly great order of things.<a name=65:1></a> There is nothing so great in the universe of God as that, into the light of which He has been pleased to bring us, over which Christ is established Head.<a name=65:2></a> We are brought not only into the kingdom, but into association with Him; and there is opened out the whole range of the glory that the Father has put upon the Son; so that if we fail to take account of ourselves here upon earth as each one of us having distinctly and definitely our own place under the headship of Christ (the realisation of which in a sense depends upon us), we miss the mark.<a name=65:3></a> There is no <i>purpose</i>, so far as I see, in an individual Christian struggling on in an individual pathway through this scene, for he never gets more fit for heaven than the work of Christ has made him.<a name=65:4></a> Hence, unless he takes account of himself as linked up with the headship of Christ, and His administration here on earth, and the testimony in connection with it, he is only an isolated Christian drifting on.<a name=65:5></a> One says it in all sobriety; such an one fills no definite place here for God.<a name=65:6></a> The line of things that has been before us in these readings is really to bring us to see what is our point of contact with the headship of Christ; what is our position in connection with the ark of the testimony.<a name=65:7></a> How are we set in connection with Levitical service; what have we to do with priesthood, and that which

		A question was raised this afternoon which suggests the difficulties that we necessarily encounter as to the pathway in a day of confusion.<a name=67:1></a> The question was asked concerning those who have a desire to go out in service to the Lord and in making the gospel known, how far are we limited?<a name=67:2></a> How far can we take as guidance what was given from the Lord to His disciples at the beginning, or how far has the failure of the outward vessel of testimony affected that?<a name=67:3></a> It is a most interesting question, and one, moreover, that applies not only to those who seek to go out in service, but to all those who seek to maintain what we believe to be due to the Lord in separation from evil, and that doubtless includes all of us here in this room.<a name=67:4></a>

		The Lord has put us through many siftings and exercises, some of which have been exceedingly painful.<a name=67:5></a> They have tried us right into the marrow, so that we have found ourselves separated from many with whom we have walked in times past in fellowship, and the thing has come home (as such testings and exercises do come home) at very close quarters, separating those who are exceedingly dear to one another in the bonds of the Lord as well as in

		the bonds of relationship.<a name=68:1></a> Now there must be a cause.<a name=68:2></a> Does the Lord really call for and expect this?<a name=68:3></a> Is such a pathway a misconception of His mind, or is it a response in affection to a call that cannot be denied?<a name=68:4></a> Pondering over the thought that was raised by the question, my mind turned to these scriptures as portions which have been of some help to me personally, and may perhaps be of help to others.<a name=68:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will recall that in our reading we had an instance in the case of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, of one who, while maintaining to a certain extent ground that was owned of God, departed from what such a position called for, and went down and allied himself with associations the most iniquitous that existed in that day.<a name=68:6></a> We had before us how on another occasion a similar alliance came up, and we were greatly impressed by the different point of view in the mind of God on each of these occasions.<a name=68:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the first case, Jehoshaphat associated himself with Ahab, the one under whom the people of God reached the very culmination of their apostate breaking away in division, who in association with his wife Jezebel expressed the fullest iniquity that could be associated with that people (See <a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#22">1 Kings  22</a>).<a name=68:8></a> Jehoshaphat allied himself with that one, and when, conscience exercising him, he called for a prophet of God, God's prophet came to speak a word which might well have appalled anyone who had the least sense of what was due to God.<a name=68:9></a> For the point of his prophecy was this, that
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=69>[Page 69]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		behind the movement with which Jehoshaphat had allied himself, God was permitting strong delusions to come, through a lying spirit, upon those who loved a lie, that they might be judged.<a name=69:1></a> Nothing could be more striking.<a name=69:2></a> The prophet had first of all prophesied a smooth thing, such as Ahab loved, but when Ahab knew that such could not be the message of God to <i>him</i>, then Micah told the truth.<a name=69:3></a> He told how God had sought a way whereby Ahab might be entrapped and ensnared to his own destruction and how means had been found in the lying word of prophecy, through which Ahab went down to his doom.<a name=69:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All this brings out in a very distinct way how God is in the background, controlling even the workings of the powers of evil, setting restraint and boundary and causing that they shall work out that which is according to His will.<a name=69:5></a> We may think that things drift this way or that, come by chance, or are the dark and dreadful power of evil against which there is no restraint, but the Spirit of God lets us into the secret of this as well as of everything else, that there is definite control, the power of evil is held in abeyance.<a name=69:6></a> It can go no further than God allows.<a name=69:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in the other instance (<a href="../bible/2Kings.htm#3">2 Kings  3</a>), when Jehoshaphat allied himself with the kings of Israel and Edom, it was brought out most strikingly that the alliance in this case, while somewhat parallel, was intended to illustrate the operation of the grace

		of God, and to bring into the most powerful light the extremes to which the grace of God can go.<a name=70:1></a> Thus the cases greatly differ.<a name=70:2></a> In this second one it is not a question of the judgment of evil under the power and will of God, but of instructing us, and the people of God through all the ages, as to how far the grace of God can go and how magnificent it can be.<a name=70:3></a> It is very helpful, therefore, to see the two sides of things.<a name=70:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I have called attention to these two scriptures in the gospels not because they are exactly parallel to Kings, but because they perhaps help up to a certain point.<a name=70:5></a> In the scripture in Matthew we get these words of the Lord, "He that is not with me is against me, and he that gathers not with me scatters".<a name=70:6></a> While in Mark we have, "He who is not against us is for us".<a name=70:7></a> From appearances it might be taken that these scriptures are contradictory, but I think the truths connected with them are calculated to be exceedingly helpful to us at the present time.<a name=70:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What are the elements of which we have to take account?<a name=70:9></a> The occasion of our being here is our confidence that the Lord has maintained a rallying-point where what is responsive to Himself and His voice can find a congenial atmosphere, a fellowship in mutual encouragement and strengthening.<a name=70:10></a> We believe that it is the intention of the Lord, until the time of His return, to maintain some such rallying-point here upon earth, and (as one has often said)

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the only question is, May we be identified with it right through to the end?<a name=71:1></a> That is the great question for us.<a name=71:2></a> We believe that the Lord has maintained the point of vantage; divine light illumines it, affection responds to it, and we are most truly thankful to gather to what is of the Lord in this day immediately before His return.<a name=71:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But what is called the Christian world, what is expressive of the religious domain, has two broad elements: one is that which is avowedly connected with the power and exaltation of the god of this world, the power of darkness.<a name=71:4></a> It is Satanic in its character, tremendous in its force, and is existing everywhere; its purpose is to thwart and defeat the purpose of God - "In whom the god of this world has blinded the thoughts of the unbelieving, so that the radiancy of the glad tidings of the glory of the Christ, who is the image of God, should not shine forth for them" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:4">2 Corinthians  4:4</a>).<a name=71:5></a> That is, it is no haphazard outlet of men's desires, of man according to the flesh indifferent to the claims God, but a well-organised and well-compacted system of evil, controlled and energised by the god of this world, intelligence given to it, and all with set purpose to darken and defeat the counsel of God.<a name=71:6></a> That is existent; and a large part of the mischief that has come in amongst the people of God is due to the fact that they are either unaware of it, or indifferent to it.<a name=71:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=72>[Page 72]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe that <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#12">Matthew  12</a>brings out this aspect of things.<a name=72:1></a> The Lord was there confronted with that which had intellectually the greatest light of God in that day, light which they knew well how to use to thwart and defeat the glory set forth in the Person of Christ; and when there had been a notable miracle in which some poor creature had his eyes opened and his tongue unloosed, so that he might see the glory shining in the face of Jesus Christ and speak His praise, then there came from those who had a greater light than any other people in that day the assertion, "This man does not cast out demons, but by Beelzebub".<a name=72:2></a> What the Lord had wrought as One who was anointed of God with the Holy Spirit was of deliberate purpose assigned to the work and power of Beelzebub.<a name=72:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With that side of things there is absolutely no compromise; there is no neutral ground, no such thing as indifference, nothing but to take an attitude of the most uncompromising opposition.<a name=72:4></a> Hence the Lord opens out that "He that is not with me is against me".<a name=72:5></a> For that character of evil, that which will take the glory of God as expressed in the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ shown forth in the power and energy of the Holy Spirit, and attribute it to the power of darkness, the Lord says there is no forgiveness, "neither in this age nor in the coming one".<a name=72:6></a> Now this type of thing is widely existent; as in the days of Ahab men loved a lie, so now that line of evil is increasing until it culminates in that

	<div class="paragraph">
		The other side (in <a href="../bible/Mark.htm#9">Mark  9</a>and similar verses in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#9">Luke  9</a>) presents the more difficult point of view and the one at which a great many have gone astray.<a name=73:4></a> There was evidently a lax state amongst the Lord's disciples.<a name=73:5></a> He was going to Capernaum.<a name=73:6></a> That did not speak very much of going to the throne of glory, because Capernaum did not appeal to the pride or importance of man.<a name=73:7></a> They were on that <i>way</i>, and as they journeyed, the Lord, watching with observant eye those that He loved (blessed High Priest, it is <i>ever so</i>!<a name=73:8></a>) and knowing all that was transpiring, asked what they had been talking of by the way.<a name=73:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		They might well be ashamed; they had been disputing which of them should be the greatest.<a name=73:10></a> It indicated that their moral state was not at all in the conception of the One they were following, so that when a little test comes which needs some spiritual instinct, some knowledge of what was suitable to the grace of the One they were following, they were dumb.<a name=73:11></a> Yet John can come to the Lord and say, "We saw someone casting out demons in thy name, who

		does not follow us and we forbad him, because he does not follow us;" and the Lord's answer is, "Forbid him not; for there is no one who shall do a miracle in my name, and be able soon after to speak ill of me; for he who is not against us is for us".<a name=74:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe that is the manner of spirit we need to appreciate and understand.<a name=74:2></a> It is a very difficult thing to go through this scene and see all that we do see with the intelligence of the light which God has been pleased to give us, without the desire to interfere and set things right which we know to be wrong.<a name=74:3></a> But it is not our business.<a name=74:4></a> The one who followed not with them had undoubtedly done a noteworthy deed through the power of the name of Jesus.<a name=74:5></a> What corresponds to this today we find connected with the labours of those who are much involved in the prevailing confusion and not at all separated in obedience to the Word.<a name=74:6></a> The Lord did not for a moment indicate to His disciples that success in service would be justification for them to go with the one who was not following, nor did it occur to them to cease following and join themselves to the one who had done the miracle in His name.<a name=74:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have been hearing this afternoon that the sovereignty of God asserts its good pleasure to do what it likes, where it likes, and in the way it likes.<a name=74:8></a> If the Spirit of God tolerates the use of a brass band to attract souls and take them where they will hear of the blood of Jesus, it is not our part to interfere.<a name=74:9></a>

		If we find that the large part of Christendom is filled with attractive means for getting crowds, it is an utter falsification of our spirit if we interfere and attempt to forbid this.<a name=75:1></a> The Lord says, "Forbid him not".<a name=75:2></a> We are called to better things than interfering with what is allowed in the sovereignty of God.<a name=75:3></a> Sometimes we ask ourselves, 'How is salvation to be accomplished?<a name=75:4></a> How is all that belongs to Christ to be gained for Christ?<a name=75:5></a>' I believe we are on false ground all the time we are worrying ourselves on that question.<a name=75:6></a> One zealous in the gospel may feel that God is working in this place and that, that there is an opportunity of speaking to souls which he cannot get unless he break outside the lines.<a name=75:7></a> I think the light given us works in this way: where you see the sovereignty of God working, thank God for it, pass on and be satisfied that in His own way and time He is taking care that all that belongs to Christ shall come to Christ.<a name=75:8></a> If He puts the opportunity to reach souls your way, thank God for it and take it with all your heart and soul, but do not join the disorder that is contrary to your light.<a name=75:9></a> The trouble is that we want to set things right instead of keeping to our own line.<a name=75:10></a> The Lord says, 'Leave that to me'.<a name=75:11></a> "Forbid him not" is not the same as saying, 'Go with him'.<a name=75:12></a>

		In the epistle to the Ephesians, after the full light of the purpose of God has been brought out, after the assembly is seen in its supreme place of blessing, the Spirit of God establishes all in the peaceable order and rule that mark every relationship here from God according to Christ.<a name=77:1></a> So that everything is provided for, down to the minutest detail, even to children and slaves.<a name=77:2></a> Then the apostle says, "For the rest, brethren", and he brings into view that which is the most imminent danger, that which threatens the complete wreck and overthrow of everything that was outwardly established in such divine perfection and blessing.<a name=77:3></a>

		The Spirit reminds the saints that the character of their conflict is not the kind of conflict that men can see, it is not against blood and flesh, but against the unseen and terrific powers of darkness that have their sway and dominion in the heavenlies; in the high places, whence is directed the full power of the god of this world, to overthrow everything that is established on behalf of Christ.<a name=77:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		but the history of the assembly (I speak of what is outward, not of what is according to the purpose of God) shows us that the overthrow came from the unseen; it came from the wiles of the devil, and it has been so complete that there are many of the people of God who are ready to inquire, 'Is there anything at all left?<a name=78:1></a>' But <i>everything</i> is left, and what we look upon with such pleasure and with such edification, as established of God in the beginning, remains immutable and unchanged, as from the divine side.<a name=78:2></a> So that the assembly upon earth still remains as the educational vessel for the principalities and authorities in the heavenlies, who still look down and learn the all-various wisdom of God.<a name=78:3></a> That is true now.<a name=78:4></a> It is not what was true on the day of Pentecost only, but now.<a name=78:5></a>

		When it comes to a question of the conflict, I think, if one may speak for others, we are a little vague as to it in our minds, and the thought arises - What is the conflict about?<a name=78:6></a> A man is not going to fight very well unless he knows in some way what he is fighting for, and that it is worth his while.<a name=78:7></a> We read <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#6">Ephesians  6</a>, and we take in the beautiful symbolic language of the Spirit of God, but through lack of exercise and intelligence in taking things up, the impression that is left is apt to be vague.<a name=78:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We perhaps take the conflict to ourselves in an individual kind of way that we are to put on the whole panoply of God and to stand, but for what?<a name=78:9></a> It clearly is not a question of standing for salvation,

		nor our individual security, nor our eternal welfare, and I am inclined to think we have often at that point just taken pleasure in the beautiful language and the lofty imagery, without having any very definite idea of what we <i>are to stand for</i>.<a name=79:1></a> But we would all agree that what is said to the Ephesian saints brings before us that the people of God are standing <i>together</i> for something.<a name=79:2></a> The appeal that comes to them is exceedingly urgent, and is evidently of the most profound importance.<a name=79:3></a> The panoply of God suggests that which has to do with everything that is vital in us; energy, the seat of affections, what pertains to intelligence, all that is involved in walk and in our being, are put ready to the hand of the Spirit of God.<a name=79:4></a>

		There is nothing vague in the conception; the vagueness is in ourselves, and it is in the hope that one may be able to give a little direction to the mind as to what it is to stand, and what there is to stand for, that I turn to Numbers as giving us, in connection with God's earthly people, something by which we may measure the divine thought as to the conflict in the present age.<a name=79:5></a>

		what is before God, and we shall not be efficient in regard to the testimony unless we are quickened in affection.<a name=110:1></a> If resurrection is the basis of God's great purpose, and of His promises which are the result of His purpose, and if we are to be any testimony to what He is going to bring to pass in the world to come, then we must reach resurrection in our <i>souls</i>.<a name=110:2></a> The Red Sea is one view of it and it is a blessed thing to see Jesus delivered for our offences and raised again for our justification, and to be clear of the world system where Satan dominates - the world of lust and pride.<a name=110:3></a> But it is another thing in spirit and affection to join Christ, by the passage of Jordan, where He is, in the resurrection sphere and so to enter into the purpose of God for us.<a name=110:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, that is, I believe, how we are effectual in regard of the testimony.<a name=110:5></a> What God will bring to pass in that day is already anticipated in our souls, so that we are a <i>living testimony</i>, of what He will bring in.<a name=110:6></a> Hence in our passage, life and incorruptibility are said to be brought to light by the glad tidings.<a name=110:7></a> What God intends is to fill the whole sphere, where death and corruption have been, with life and incorruptibility.<a name=110:8></a> They have been brought to light, and as we are in the true gain of resurrection, we are a testimony to what God will bring in.<a name=110:9></a> You will find in the passage I have read how intimately the testimony of our Lord is connected with life and incorruptibility.<a name=110:10></a>

		Before I close I will add a word in regard to the young, that they may be encouraged to appreciate what has been brought to pass in the resurrection of Christ.<a name=111:1></a> It is a good thing to have the full range of truth presented to us; and even if the truth sometimes appears to be difficult, the great thing is to appreciate and enjoy it; and it is wonderful how, when we seek to appropriate and enjoy these things, they lay hold of us, and how we unconsciously get formed by them.<a name=111:2></a> If I might speak on behalf of those who are older in the faith, we may have been many years on the road and may have learned but little, not perhaps through lack of light, but on account of our own wilfulness.<a name=111:3></a> So I would the more suggest to my younger brethren to go in heartily for all that God presents to you in the ministry of His word, and to seek to make it your own.<a name=111:4></a> In so doing you will not only enjoy it, but you will make progress, though you may not be conscious of the progress that you make, but you will find that, as the result, Christ will become increasingly known and exceedingly enhanced to your souls.<a name=111:5></a> Surely, speaking generally, that is what we all desire.<a name=111:6></a> Resurrection is set forth in that blessed Man.<a name=111:7></a> He has appeared.<a name=111:8></a> He became man with a view to <i>annulling</i> death, by <i>going into</i> death, and bringing to light life and incorruptibility.<a name=111:9></a> All this has been effected by that blessed Man.<a name=111:10></a> The result is a new generation for God, a generation which shall give Him pleasure, a generation which takes its pattern

		In the Old Testament there are only two positive statements with regard to eternal life - one in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#133">Psalm  133</a>and the other in <a href="../bible/Daniel.htm#12">Daniel  12</a>.<a name=113:1></a> The reading of these passages would suffice to show that they belong to the future.<a name=113:2></a> They are really prophetic and connected with the future history of God's earthly people, and I think you can understand how, of necessity, eternal life in the Old Testament could only be spoken of in the way we have just mentioned - it awaited the revelation of God.<a name=113:3></a> The wonderful thing we come to in the gospel by John is the revelation of God.<a name=113:4></a> From the very outset of the book, the revelation of God is viewed as an accomplished fact.<a name=113:5></a> I will just cite one verse to prove that; "No one has seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, <i>he</i> hath declared him" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:18">John  1:18</a>).<a name=113:6></a> Hence, in the gospel of John, you get eternal life as a present thing.<a name=113:7></a>

		in the gospel of John, because in that gospel you are brought face to face with that most marvellous fact - the revelation of God.<a name=114:1></a> There are many facts full of interest and of great importance in the Scriptures, but it is not too much to say that the greatest of all is the perfect revelation of God in the Person of the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, but it is in Him viewed as Man down here.<a name=114:2></a> Indeed, the revelation of God forms the foundation of the gospel, the foundation of Christianity, and I wish just to draw your attention to two or three points in connection with the scriptures we have read.<a name=114:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, I want to speak of the revelation of God, and then I would speak a little of the divine intent which God had before Him in the revelation of Himself in the Person of His Son, and then to show a little what eternal life is, and who are entitled to eternal life and how those who are entitled to it are brought into it.<a name=114:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I do not want to make any invidious distinctions in Scripture, but I think I may say simply and freely in regard to the verses read from <a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>that there is a marvellous concentration of light in this passage.<a name=114:5></a> It is the light of God, the light of the perfect revelation of God in the Person of Jesus, who is the Christ, the Son of God.<a name=114:6></a> It would be difficult in all the compass of Scripture to find a passage where there is such a marvellous concentration of light as in these wonderful words

		uttered by our Lord Jesus Christ, in His interview with Nicodemus.<a name=115:1></a> I need not attempt to say much - for <a href="../bible/John.htm#3:16">John  3:16</a> has been spoken of so often and so fully - but where in all the Scriptures, from Genesis to Revelation, can you find such an unveiling of the heart of God as in that wonderful verse, "For God so loved the world" etc.<a name=115:2></a>?<a name=115:3></a> The very heart of God is there unfolded, and that in a most wonderful way.<a name=115:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I trust you will bear with the utterance of such simple and obvious truths, but where else in Scripture do you read of God's love for the <i>world</i>?<a name=115:5></a> There are many scriptures which speak of God's love for His children - for His people, for those who are in relationship with Himself - but where else, except in this wonderful verse, do you read of God's love for the world?<a name=115:6></a> There has been a moment (and <i>what</i> a moment) in the history of the world when all the love of God for the world shone out.<a name=115:7></a> I need not say that the statement, "God so loved the world" is not the love of complacency; it is not the love of delight.<a name=115:8></a> One can hardly think of the world, especially in the light of John, being an object of complacency, or even those who composed the world being objects of divine complacency or delight, but it is the love of omnipotent pity, of infinite compassion.<a name=115:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, taking up these verses again for a moment, I think the revelation of God is two-fold.<a name=115:10></a> I think in verses 14 and 15 it is the revelation of God in righteousness.<a name=115:11></a> Someone has said, and it has been

	<div class="paragraph">
		well said, that the righteousness of God is witnessed in the removal, in judgment, of the man that brought in sin and judgment.<a name=116:1></a> We are apt, I think many believers are apt, to limit the thought of the righteousness of God to the way that God has dealt with our sins in the death of Christ.<a name=116:2></a> But if man according to the flesh, the man who has brought in sin, if that man were allowed to remain, the righteousness of God would be compromised before the universe.<a name=116:3></a> <i>But</i> "as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, thus must the Son of man be lifted up, that every one who believes on him may not perish, but have life eternal".<a name=116:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Many elder believers here, perhaps, will remember a very simple little tract written a great many years ago by C H M on the two 'musts' in <a href="../bible/John.htm#3">John  3</a>(AV).<a name=116:5></a> I think most of us recognise the first 'must' as a necessity on account of man's condition, but I understand that in the second 'must' (verse 14) it is not the necessity of our condition - it is the necessity of the rights and claims of God.<a name=116:6></a> Man according to the flesh must be removed in the lifting up of our Lord Jesus Christ as the Son of man.<a name=116:7></a> That was the great antitype of the brazen serpent, lifted up in <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#21">Numbers  21</a>.<a name=116:8></a> The righteousness of God was revealed in the removal of man according to the flesh.<a name=116:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Of course, when we speak of the removal of man, we do not refer to any individual, or to any person as such, because we have but to read the

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=117>[Page 117]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Scripture to its end to see that is not the force of what we are speaking of.<a name=117:1></a> God is revealed in righteousness and then (verse 16) is the revelation of God in love.<a name=117:2></a> That God might be revealed in righteousness the Son of man <i>must</i> be lifted up, but if God is to be revealed in His love for the world, then nothing short of the gift of the only-begotten Son could give expression to that love.<a name=117:3></a> I need hardly add that while there is distinction between verses 14, 15 and 16, there is no separation, because we learn that the "Son of man" is the "only-begotten Son".<a name=117:4></a> The Lord's words here are the light of the revelation of God.<a name=117:5></a> Verses 14 and 15 were spoken anticipatively - that is, you have to travel to the end of the gospel of John before you see the Son of man lifted up on the cross.<a name=117:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the Lord's words here are in the light of the perfect revelation of God.<a name=117:7></a> It is not simply that God was revealed in Him, or by Him, but I think it might be put more strongly - that divine Person, as Man down here, was the perfect revelation of God.<a name=117:8></a> No doubt we have to speak in a comprehensive way, because we have to go on in the path of the Lord Jesus Christ till we reach the cross.<a name=117:9></a> It all concentrated there and was completed there.<a name=117:10></a> The Son of man was lifted up, and hence we have it, "Not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son a propitiation for our sins" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:10">1 John  4:10</a>), and it was not in the life of the Lord, as in the

	<div class="paragraph">
		days of His flesh, that propitiation was effected, but it was in His death.<a name=118:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I wish to speak of the divine intent, what God had before Him in revealing Himself.<a name=118:2></a> If we adhere to the language of the Lord here, and we are surely safe in adhering to His language, then I think we should have to say this - that what God had before Him in coming out in the revelation of Himself was that man might have eternal life.<a name=118:3></a> There is very little in the gospel of John about forgiveness, or justification.<a name=118:4></a> There is nothing that answers to the passover or the Red Sea.<a name=118:5></a> The very first mention by the Lord Himself of His death is in chapter 3: 14, "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, thus must the Son of man be lifted up, that every one who believes on him may not perish, but have life eternal".<a name=118:6></a> I think we might say, and it is an interesting point in John, that the revelation of God is connected with the purpose of God, and yet while that is true, it is in the gospel of John as in no other gospel, that you get that wonderful expression "<i>every one</i>".<a name=118:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The light shines, a light for all, and if it is the light of the revelation of God, no one can impose any restriction, or place any limitation to that light.<a name=118:8></a> Yet on the other hand, the revelation of God is in connection with God's purpose, and this wonderful expression "eternal life" is the expression of the divine intent of blessing for man.<a name=118:9></a> It is wonderful in the gospel of John how prominent eternal life is.<a name=118:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Salvation in the gospel of John always follows eternal life, never precedes it.<a name=119:1></a> In verses 14 to 16 it is life eternal.<a name=119:2></a> In verse 17 it is, "For God has not sent his Son into the world that he may judge the world, but that the world may be saved through him".<a name=119:3></a> Then in <a href="../bible/John.htm#10:9">John  10:9</a> the Lord says, "I am the door: if any one enter in by me, he shall be saved".<a name=119:4></a> Salvation comes as the consequence of entering in, and what do you enter into?<a name=119:5></a> You enter into that which is set forth in Himself - the perfect light of the perfect revelation of God.<a name=119:6></a> In this connection I call your attention to the words in <a href="../bible/John.htm#17:3">John  17:3</a>, because they are important, "And this is the eternal life, that they should know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent".<a name=119:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/John.htm#20:30">John  20:30</a>, 31 it says, "Many other signs therefore also Jesus did before his disciples, which are not written in this book; but these are written that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life in his name".<a name=119:8></a> The "Son of God", in Scripture, does not set forth the truth of His Person as a divine Person, but sets forth the truth of His Person viewed as Man in relation to God.<a name=119:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think you can begin to understand, in a sense, how eternal life is the great point of blessing.<a name=119:10></a> It is the great intent that God had in the revelation of Himself in the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=119:11></a> There, is the Father revealed in the Son as Man, and eternal life consists in the knowledge of the Father as the only

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Who has title to eternal life?<a name=120:4></a> The answer of John's gospel is, "He that believes on the Son" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:36">John  3:36</a>).<a name=120:5></a> The great point in the gospel of John is to bring you to believe, "That ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life in his name".<a name=120:6></a> It is the believer who gets it.<a name=120:7></a> The great gain of believing is that you get the Holy Spirit, and then you come into the realm and region of knowledge.<a name=120:8></a> Receiving the Holy Spirit you come to know the Father as the only true God, and you come to know Jesus Christ, the Father's sent One.<a name=120:9></a> May God make these things real to us, so that we may be found answering to the blessed light of the revelation of God in the Person of His only-begotten Son.<a name=120:10></a>

		I want to say a few words to you tonight on what I understand to be the thought of sonship - what it is to be brought into and enjoy the peculiar privilege of being one of the sons of God.<a name=121:1></a> I need not say it is one of the greatest dignities that God could confer upon man; but when you come to know God, you find that He acts according to what He is - according to His own greatness - and He makes the need and the ruin of man but the occasion of bringing out His own resources.<a name=121:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, there is nothing more important than that we should get, by the power of the Spirit of God, a clear sense in our souls of what God has called us to.<a name=121:3></a> I may say it is one of the deepest joys of any 'son' to have in his heart a sense of the greatness and the dignity of the position to which God has called him.<a name=121:4></a> You find today that everything is in movement; there is activity on every hand; but the saints have to learn (and sooner or later everyone finds it out) that activity in service is not morally great enough to command the heart of a 'son'.<a name=121:5></a> You may serve, not in the sense of sonship, but you will have underneath the service something that is not

		satisfied.<a name=122:1></a> The reason is simple - it is because one of the sons of God is morally too great to be satisfied with service.<a name=122:2></a> The only thing that will satisfy a son is the affection of his Father.<a name=122:3></a> Someone may say, 'Why am I left in this scene, whilst others are taken home?<a name=122:4></a>' The reason is that the affections are ripened sooner perhaps in one than in another.<a name=122:5></a> What God is doing in each one of us is ripening our affections as sons, so that we may adequately respond to the joy and delight that our Father has in us.<a name=122:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In Matthew's gospel we have the truth of sonship.<a name=122:7></a> No one will deny that the great thought in the King is that He is the Son.<a name=122:8></a> You will remember the first time a king was given to Israel, God drew attention to the fact that he was a son - Saul, the son of Kish.<a name=122:9></a> But God brought in another kind of man, David, the son of Jesse; and what marked David, the son of Jesse, was that he was beloved.<a name=122:10></a> He was a pattern man; he was a man after God's own heart; and he cherished in his soul the fact that he was beloved of God.<a name=122:11></a> He may have failed - and he did fail - but his failure, while proving to him with increasing severity the depths of the wickedness of his own heart, made him cling all the more firmly to the fact that he was beloved of God.<a name=122:12></a> So, though we may have to learn the depths of the depravity of the natural heart, may the Lord encourage our hearts on this side, - that we are beloved by God.<a name=122:13></a>

		Then you find in Matthew what might be called the <i>characteristics</i> of a son: you get his home; and then his privileges.<a name=123:1></a> In the first verse of chapter 1 we read, "Book of the generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham".<a name=123:2></a> There you see He is a Son on two lines; one is that He is the Son of a royal king; and the other that He is the Son of a man of faith.<a name=123:3></a> Then in the next chapter we get recorded this remarkable fact - Herod had issued a decree that all the boys were to be slain; and the Lord was taken down into Egypt.<a name=123:4></a> Now, why was He taken down into Egypt?<a name=123:5></a> I will tell you; He was taken into Egypt that you and I might be delivered out of it.<a name=123:6></a> A decree had been issued, by one in authority, that all the boys were to be put to death, and the Lord was taken down into Egypt, not to avoid Herod's sword, but that the scripture might be fulfilled.<a name=123:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But perhaps a still more striking example is recorded in Old Testament scripture - Pharaoh commanded that all the male children of the children of Israel should be killed.<a name=123:8></a> Why?<a name=123:9></a> Satan's thought was, beloved friends, that God should have no sons.<a name=123:10></a> Christ went down into Egypt that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, "Out of Egypt have I called my son" (verse 15).<a name=123:11></a> Now, what is the first characteristic of a son of God?<a name=123:12></a> It is this, that in heart and affections he is free from the world.<a name=123:13></a> None of us can ever know in our souls the true height of the dignity and

		enjoyment that belong to the sons of God, if we have not, in heart and affections, got free from the world - "Out of Egypt have I called my son" - and what marks each one of the sons is that he is morally free from the world: "Our Lord Jesus Christ, who gave himself for our sins, so that he should deliver us out of the present evil world" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#1:3">Galatians  1:3</a>, 4).<a name=124:1></a>

		The Son of man is an object of delight to heaven.<a name=125:1></a> Why?<a name=125:2></a> Nothing could be more simple; it is because He walked "in paths of righteousness for his name's sake" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#23:3">Psalm  23:3</a>).<a name=125:3></a> He says, "Thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness".<a name=125:4></a> The blessed Lord Jesus came into humanity; and although John here would have hindered Him, He is found in "paths of righteousness for his name's sake", and heaven opens on Him with supreme delight; the Spirit of God descends like a dove, and lights upon Him, and a voice from heaven announces, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight".<a name=125:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, Christ is the great Pattern; and whilst the heavens opened upon <i>Him</i> in a pre-eminent way, still those who walk in the paths of righteousness - despised and rejected of men though they be - are objects of the most profound interest to heaven, and God looks down with delight upon them.<a name=125:6></a> What has God done to prove the extent of His delight in His sons?<a name=125:7></a> Well, He has proved it by giving the Holy Spirit from heaven, so that what came out in the Pattern - in the true Son - might come out in us.<a name=125:8></a> For He is the great Pattern; and "God has sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:6">Galatians  4:6</a>).<a name=125:9></a>

		So, beloved friends, you are entitled down here, each one of you, to count yourself an object of the great delight of heaven.<a name=125:10></a> Scripture, speaking of the family of faith, says of them, "Of whom the world was not worthy" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:38">Hebrews  11:38</a>).<a name=125:11></a> No, indeed, it was

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, another thing I want to refer to is, the <i>spirit</i> of the son.<a name=126:3></a> I think from Matthew's gospel, chapter 5, to the end of chapter 7, you see the spirit of a son.<a name=126:4></a> He is like his Father; and you could have no greater standard.<a name=126:5></a> God could have no greater standard than that His sons on this earth should be like Himself.<a name=126:6></a> So you get this verse: "Blessed the peace-makers, for <i>they</i> shall be called sons of God" (verse 9).<a name=126:7></a> There you get the idea of a people of dignity, in a scene of confusion.<a name=126:8></a> I have no doubt the sons are left down here to be the great peace-makers; and the basis of it all is that they do not tolerate any confusion - neither inside nor outside.<a name=126:9></a> This feature comes out beautifully in the early disciples; they went about, and they removed every element of confusion.<a name=126:10></a> Why?<a name=126:11></a> Because they would only allow their souls to dwell on one Man.<a name=126:12></a> If they were referred to by Jew, or Gentile, by Pharisee, or Sadducee, it made no difference to them; they only allowed of <i>one</i> Man, and that One was the Man Christ Jesus.<a name=126:13></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in our ways and manner of life down here we are to be peace-makers.<a name=127:5></a> Does that mean that you are going to close your eyes to anything that is wrong?<a name=127:6></a> No, it does not.<a name=127:7></a> There are a thousand and one things wrong; but a son of God does not go about this world occupied with what is wrong.<a name=127:8></a> Why?<a name=127:9></a> Because he has the spirit of his Father - the blessed God.<a name=127:10></a> And what is He occupied with?<a name=127:11></a> He is occupied with what is good.<a name=127:12></a> Yet He knows better than any what is wrong.<a name=127:13></a>

		Now, in chapter 5: 43 - 45, we read, "Ye have heard that it has been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy.<a name=127:14></a> But <i>I</i> say unto you, Love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who insult you and persecute you, that ye may be the sons of your Father who is in the heavens".<a name=127:15></a> That is the spirit which is to mark us.<a name=127:16></a> You may say there are so many wrong things to be put right.<a name=127:17></a> Yes, but that is not what the sons are to be occupied with.<a name=127:18></a> Their present business is to take care of the interests of the Father; and they are discovered to be sons by the fact that they are going about doing

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We get a beautiful example in Old Testament Scripture in the case of Elijah.<a name=129:8></a> Elijah was a man who was poor in spirit, meek and lowly, and yet he could come into this scene, and bring all the resources of heaven to bear upon the poor and needy people of the world.<a name=129:9></a> What we want to display in this world is the spirit of the sons of God.<a name=129:10></a>

		Now I come to another side of things, <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16">Matthew  16</a>.<a name=130:6></a> People may say to you: It's all very well to talk, but we have to go through the world; we have to earn our bread and butter, and we have to face things here.<a name=130:7></a> Well, speaking very plainly, if I were to take any one of you, and ask you how do you manage to surmount the peculiar difficulties of your business day after day, what would you say?<a name=130:8></a> Not speaking of Christianity at all, take a hard-working business man in Belfast, and ask him that question, what would he say to you?<a name=130:9></a> He would say - Come home with me.<a name=130:10></a> You go home with him; and what do you find?<a name=130:11></a> You find he has a place where he can sit down, and dismiss all these cares from his mind - a place where he can rest; where he finds home comforts and encouragement, and the warmth of affection; and he goes back to business again, invigorated, and like a new man.<a name=130:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in this chapter you find the home of the sons of God.<a name=130:13></a> The blessed Lord turns to the disciples and asks them; "Who do men say that I the Son of man am?<a name=130:14></a>" (verse 13).<a name=130:15></a> They replied, some say thou art John the baptist; some Elias; and others Jeremias, or one of the prophets.<a name=130:16></a> Then He said to them, "But <i>ye</i>, who do ye say that I am?<a name=130:17></a>" The response is so

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is a great thing to appreciate that circle where Christ is known in His own blessedness - where you go in from the turmoil of this world, and sit down and rest in His presence.<a name=131:6></a> You find yourself in a circle where you have not to love your enemies, or to bless them that persecute you.<a name=131:7></a> You are loved by everyone; and they are all glad to see you; and you are glad to see them.<a name=131:8></a> It is a wonderful spot - the assembly of the Son of the living God.<a name=131:9></a> No intruding enemy ever put his foot there; and whilst we have to walk through this scene in the spirit of sons, we have a home circle where we can sit down and enjoy divine refreshment in the house of God.<a name=131:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, as to the privileges, there are two great elements that interfere with the privileges of sons, and they are illustrated by Moses and Elias.<a name=131:11></a> Moses was a most honoured man.<a name=131:12></a> You could not over-estimate his importance, but <i>he</i> had to say to man in responsibility and to tell man what he ought to do.<a name=131:13></a> But when you come to the privilege of sons, you do not come to man in responsibility.<a name=131:14></a> Moses was a

		wonderful man; he was bearing with a people than whom, I suppose, there never were any more trying to have to do with; and yet he was the meekest man on earth.<a name=132:1></a> But you have not to do with Moses; he has to go out, else you are robbed of your privilege of sonship, for he was only a servant.<a name=132:2></a> Now, if Moses tells you what you ought to <i>do</i>, Elias reminds you of what you ought to have <i>been</i>.<a name=132:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two classes of christians who are not enjoying the privilege of sons, and they are robbed of it by reason of this - on the one hand they say, 'I am not what I ought to be'.<a name=132:4></a> Granted.<a name=132:5></a> Then the other class say 'Ah, if we had only been faithful, look what we might have been'.<a name=132:6></a> Quite true; that is Elias.<a name=132:7></a> But neither of these two men set forth sonship.<a name=132:8></a> Then there is another interfering element - when on the mount, Peter wanted to speak.<a name=132:9></a> You may have a nice thought, and you want to give expression to it.<a name=132:10></a> Peter <i>had</i> a nice thought, but there came a cloud and blotted it out.<a name=132:11></a> I like what blots out everything but Christ - there came a cloud that overshadowed them, and a voice out of the cloud said, "<i>This</i> is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight: hear him".<a name=132:12></a> To hear Him is the peculiar privilege of the sons of God.<a name=132:13></a> There is no greater privilege that the people of God have, than to be in the spot where the Father is free to unfold His delight in His beloved Son to those whom love has drawn together.<a name=132:14></a> The Father's delight is that we should hear the Son's voice, and learn what He is doing for the Father.<a name=132:15></a>

		I purpose speaking on what the spiritual man is made like, and the consequence of the spiritual man in a day of difficulty.<a name=135:1></a> I chose Solomon because I think he is perhaps the most beautiful figure of the fruit of the Spirit in the Old Testament; he typifies, in that way, the spiritual man.<a name=135:2></a> You will remember that Solomon was a man of peace; his very name suggests it, and one of the fruits of the Spirit is peace.<a name=135:3></a> A king had come in and subjugated every adverse power, and had brought the house of Saul, the carnal man, to a close; and, as the fruit of the Spirit, you get this man - beautiful type of one delightful to the heart of God - on the throne, and you get suggested in Solomon what the spiritual man is really like.<a name=135:4></a> I just take these thoughts to give you in a simple and concise way the apprehension of a spiritual man.<a name=135:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If I take the start, the mark of true spirituality is that we take a very small account of ourselves.<a name=135:6></a> If you take Solomon, he had everything on the natural side to make him great; he could have said, 'If there is a man in the world of any importance it is myself, for I am the son of David the king, and I have

		inherited the throne; I am in a most important position'.<a name=136:1></a> But he says, "I am but a little child".<a name=136:2></a> This was not sentiment; it was the consequence in this man's soul of being in the conscious presence of the God of Israel.<a name=136:3></a> He meditated before God in this dream, and in it God spoke to him.<a name=136:4></a> It is very beautiful; God puts Himself at his disposal for any request.<a name=136:5></a> He feels, 'Who am I that I should be spoken to by such a wonderful Person as the God of Israel?<a name=136:6></a>'
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		People may ask, How we are to discern the marks of the spiritual person?<a name=136:7></a> They think that a spiritual person is some great brother or sister that has shone for some time amongst the brethren.<a name=136:8></a> That is all wrong; that is not necessary for spirituality; it is a person who in the sense of the presence of God can feel his own littleness.<a name=136:9></a> This is the first step in the most extraordinary advancement of spirituality.<a name=136:10></a> Take the blessed Lord Himself, I am sure we all covet to be as that blessed Man was, going along with the lowly.<a name=136:11></a> Look at the humility, the beautiful humility, of the Person of Christ; He created the world at His word, and yet there was the beautiful spirit of humility.<a name=136:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now when you come to Solomon you get true spirituality, and what is the consequence?<a name=136:13></a> It leaves the blessed God free to unfold all His wealth to this man.<a name=136:14></a> I would like to draw your attention to the second incident because it is the point that tests our spirituality practically.<a name=136:15></a> It is when the saints are

	<div class="paragraph">
		I sometimes allow myself the privilege of sitting down and meditating on the assemblies on the earth, and Paul's dealing with them.<a name=138:8></a> They must have thought, 'How privileged we are to live in the day of the apostle's ministry'.<a name=138:9></a> They looked at the Corinthians and said, 'We shall never make anything of that place;' but the spiritual man had taken the matter in hand, helped by the Lord, and had brought the sword of the Spirit to bear upon the assembly in Corinth.<a name=138:10></a> Great searching of heart was the result.<a name=138:11></a> Look at the way the genuine affections come out!<a name=138:12></a> How their hearts went out to the apostle, and how delightful to see the spurious thing gone; and the testimony reached all the assemblies.<a name=138:13></a> We think spirituality lies in an outward form.<a name=138:14></a> What

	<div class="paragraph">
		I turn to the next incident for a moment: it is full of encouragement.<a name=139:5></a> What you get there is the gain of spirituality.<a name=139:6></a> The apostle gives you a figure in the New Testament, but the figure in the Old Testament is exceedingly beautiful.<a name=139:7></a> "And God gave Solomon wisdom and very great understanding and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea-shore".<a name=139:8></a> One mark of wisdom is "largeness of heart".<a name=139:9></a> We are straitened in our affections; and the reason is we are not wise enough to be large.<a name=139:10></a> We are afraid of being captured or turned aside.<a name=139:11></a>

		Now a word as to the last incident in Solomon; that is 'testimony'.<a name=141:5></a> The Queen of Sheba heard of the wisdom of Solomon.<a name=141:6></a> I hear people complain sometimes like this: 'It is very difficult to get an audience, no one comes into our room'.<a name=141:7></a> You do not want the audience, you want something for the audience when they come.<a name=141:8></a> Do you think if the apostle were to come to this city we should be here long?<a name=141:9></a> I greatly appreciate the company of the saints, but if I knew a man as spiritual as he was here, I should be one of the first to go and hear him.<a name=141:10></a> How far did the wisdom of Solomon extend?<a name=141:11></a> It reached the Queen of Sheba.<a name=141:12></a> There was no need for notices, there were results; and tidings had reached the Queen of Sheba.<a name=141:13></a> She considered it inconceivable that there should be a man on the earth that could do those things; she came to see, and tell her hard questions.<a name=141:14></a> They were nothing to the spiritual man, and when all the questions were ended, the Spirit could unlock the door and show more than any human person can take in.<a name=141:15></a> When Solomon had unlocked the door to the system of things for which the spiritual man is formed, she turns and it is one unbroken burst of praise, not to Solomon, nor to the people around, but to God.<a name=141:16></a>

		It is very wonderful how God has, in the Scriptures, thought of everything that His people need in regard to all that which they have to encounter right through until the Lord comes again.<a name=145:1></a> But we all require to know how to cut "in a straight line the word of truth" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:15">2 Timothy  2:15</a>), so as not to miss the force of the Scriptures in their application to our varied exercises.<a name=145:2></a> It is very easy to miss the force of Scripture, and the profit and gain of it, by wrongly applying it.<a name=145:3></a> I do not think that the particular defect of people in the separate path - and I may also say of some who have left the path - lies so much in ignorance of Scripture, as in the manifest inability to apply it correctly to things as they arise.<a name=145:4></a> Wisdom furnishes the right application of knowledge.<a name=145:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is possible to know a great deal of Scripture, and yet not to be wise in knowing how to apply it, so that instead of this knowledge being useful to us in an emergency, it rather tends to give us a puffed-up sense of our knowledge, and so with all our knowledge we may take the wrong course and make

	<div class="paragraph">
		serious mistakes.<a name=146:1></a> After all, we need something beyond a correct exposition of Scripture, valuable as that is, to preserve us in God's way.<a name=146:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This epistle was written to the individual.<a name=146:3></a> There are not many epistles written to the individual, but it is most important that we should pay attention to those that <i>are written</i>, because each individual needs them for himself.<a name=146:4></a> The first epistle to Timothy teaches the individual how to behave himself in God's house, and behaviour according to God's mind in God's house is behaving consistently with what the house is.<a name=146:5></a> This second epistle was written purposely to teach the individual - the faithful one, the one who desires to be here according to God's mind, how to be pleasing to God in the midst of a state of things that is not pleasing to Him.<a name=146:6></a> It recognises the departure as having begun, that is quite clear.<a name=146:7></a> When I say departure, I do not mean exactly departure from Christ, or giving up Christ, but departure from Paul.<a name=146:8></a> "All who are in Asia .<a name=146:9></a>.<a name=146:10></a>.<a name=146:11></a> have turned away from me" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1:15">2 Timothy  1:15</a>).<a name=146:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You see that was the point of the departure, and it was at that juncture that the apostle wrote this epistle to the individual - to his faithful son in the faith, one to whom he could impart directions how to act in regard to the state of things that had come in.<a name=146:13></a> That state of things has increased immensely since that day, but instruction was given
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=147>[Page 147]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		at once to the faithful individual by the apostle as soon as it began, and this instruction is not less, but more, needful at the present time.<a name=147:1></a> I fear that many have not been brought <i>by the Lord</i> into the separate path, but have taken it voluntarily.<a name=147:2></a> I would therefore earnestly counsel each one to turn to the Lord, and look to the Lord, so as to receive direction from Him in regard to the path He would have you pursue.<a name=147:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Supposing, however, we have been divinely brought into this outwardly separate path from all around us - I mean now as believers, and in regard to religious things and associations more particularly - we are still in danger of falling under the influence of a good deal that we profess to have left, and, indeed, have left positionally.<a name=147:4></a> However, we need to leave what is around us in a deeper sense, so as to be clear of it in our souls, in order that what is going on around may not hinder us or indeed occupy us.<a name=147:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now for this we require to know where our resources are, against all these varied influences to which we are daily and constantly liable, and to which we are so easily subject, as we come into contact with persons who have not taken the separate path, and whose ideas are very far away from the truth - persons who see no harm in a great many things which are contrary to God's mind; and who are very zealous in a way that is not God's

		way.<a name=148:1></a> How very blessed, then, it is that God has thought of the faithful individual in regard to these things, and provided in the Scriptures all needed instruction for each one who would be faithful to God in the midst of unfaithfulness, and in order that he might know how to act.<a name=148:2></a> These directions are very simple when once we see their true and proper bearing and application.<a name=148:3></a> Each faithful one thus knows where to turn for guidance, for instruction, and learns by this epistle how to behave himself in relation to the departure - the ruin around.<a name=148:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there is a danger - and I would warn all against it - of simply coming out from churches and chapels, or meetings that do not accept the path of separation, to connect ourselves with a body of people called 'Exclusive Brethren'.<a name=148:5></a> True, you may have sat behind (as we say) for a time, and have heard such speak and seen how they act; you may have adopted certain ways as the right course of procedure, so that, in course of time, you may have been received inside, and you suppose by this course that you know how to act.<a name=148:6></a> But I do not think that mere observation and usage is the way to learn how to act according to God.<a name=148:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You need to have scriptural principles deeply embedded in your soul, so that if a meeting should become divided, or a rupture should occur, you are not upset at all, because you have that to guide you which cannot possibly change or fail.<a name=148:8></a> I think you
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=149>[Page 149]</a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there are many things in this epistle to which I cannot call attention tonight, but I want to place before you the resources of the individual in regard to what he has to contend with, and they are all said to be in <i>Christ Jesus</i>.<a name=149:2></a> I am not great on numbers, and do not wish to occupy you with them, but it is rather striking that the number seven should occur here, in that, seven times, the expression "in Christ Jesus" is used.<a name=149:3></a> This expression is not given here to show the believer that he is in Christ, or what he is in Christ - you get that elsewhere - it is given here more to show the faithful individual the resources he has in Christ in regard to the ruin, in regard to the state of things around.<a name=149:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing here mentioned that the faithful one has in Christ Jesus, and that is available to him in Christ, is, I doubt not, in contrast with a religious order of things in the flesh, where things are accommodated to man in the flesh, where he builds up systems, and an outward order of things in which men can display themselves, where they can honour one another.<a name=149:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The very first principle, then, which every faithful one must have clearly in his soul and understand, and that is available to him is life - "life which is in Christ Jesus".<a name=149:6></a> You will call to mind that it was up to this point of life that the

		imitation in the days of Moses could proceed, and no further.<a name=150:1></a> Everything on this side of death, we must remember, can be imitated.<a name=150:2></a> There are in some of our large cities various meetings apart from each other, and when separate meetings exist in one place that have no fellowship with each other, we surely have a solemn state of things, for such have left the sects, and profess to be unsectarian, and assume to be gathered to the name of the Lord.<a name=150:3></a> What are you to make of such a state of things?<a name=150:4></a> The imitation is so close that if you were to go into each of those meetings, sit down, watch the procedure, listen to the phrases and the hymns, you could scarcely tell any difference between them outwardly.<a name=150:5></a> There is a difference somewhere, but you must discern it in another way; that is in a spiritual way.<a name=150:6></a> There <i>is</i> a spiritual way, but it is only found by what you have in Christ.<a name=150:7></a> Yes, the imitation has become so close that souls who are not instructed in these principles which are given in 2 Timothy are easily led astray, and drawn into associations from which they would be preserved if they were making use of their resources in Christ.<a name=150:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first and great thing in order to realise this preservation is to admit where your life is, to admit it honestly in the faith of your soul, and recognise this great truth, that life is in Christ Jesus.<a name=150:9></a> Where you are to live, in the life of your soul, is in a glorified Man.<a name=150:10></a> That is not a very advanced truth for

		Now the next great thing to admit, to hold fast in your soul, is the fact that what God has given you in Christ is according to His own purpose and grace, and that it was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began.<a name=153:6></a> A divine Person in the Godhead has now become a Man, and the One who is now a Man is the same Person who was before the world began, and God, according to His own purpose and grace, gave us this wonderful grace, in which we are now standing in Christ Jesus before the world began.<a name=153:7></a> Why is that stated here?<a name=153:8></a> I think it is to show to every one of us that what is given to us in Christ Jesus is outside this present world and that this present world has no part in it.<a name=153:9></a> So that if you drop down into this present visible course of things in your soul, you are robbed of the enjoyment and the realisation of what God has given you in

	<div class="paragraph">
		I might here remark, for the help of the young, more particularly, that there are two distinct aspects of salvation in Scripture.<a name=154:6></a> In one aspect it is said, "Who has saved us", in another aspect it is always said, "Shall be saved".<a name=154:7></a> You must seek to hold these two aspects distinct.<a name=154:8></a> One is God's side, the other is ours.<a name=154:9></a> "Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:21">Acts  2:21</a>).<a name=154:10></a> That is very important because we need it now, every day of our lives, every moment of the day.<a name=154:11></a> But there is another side.<a name=154:12></a> As viewed from God's standpoint, as viewed in Christ, we are always said to be saved.<a name=154:13></a> Both are true.<a name=154:14></a> Here it is, "Who has saved us".<a name=154:15></a> Our works have nothing to do with it, even our faith is not connected with it here.<a name=154:16></a> It is not that side, it is God's side.<a name=154:17></a> He has acted according to His own heart, His own purpose, His own love - He has saved us according to that which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began.<a name=154:18></a> Nothing that happens down here can touch that, we may be certain.<a name=154:19></a>

		The third thing is the way to hold fast in your soul the apostle Paul's teaching, not in a detailed way, but in an outline way, a sort of summary, so that you may have a distinct sense in your soul of what really is the apostle's teaching.<a name=154:20></a> That is important, because he says, "Inasmuch as <i>I</i> am apostle of nations, I glorify my ministry" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11:3">Romans  11:3</a>).<a name=154:21></a>

		It is evident that whilst the Lord would disclose Himself to true affection in every feature of His Person, He yet reserves to Himself the sovereign right to touch each in a unique way with some distinctive impression of His glory, and thus qualify such a one to take his place in the body of Christ, to shine there in the light in which he has learned Christ.<a name=185:7></a> One had rather that thought in view in referring to the variety of the material, each

	<div class="paragraph">
		I have before me to say a few words on what the hope of His calling is, connected, as it is, with the riches of His inheritance in the saints.<a name=191:1></a> You will doubtless remember that when God brought Israel out of Egypt, He had it before Him to bring them in and plant them in the mountain of His inheritance.<a name=191:2></a> He would plant them there; that is to say, He would have His people to share in the things that He Himself delighted in.<a name=191:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now I should like us to look for a little at the inheritance on the heavenly side - and I may say in passing it is not the mountain of His inheritance exactly, but it is that which the blessed God has taken up in Christ, and His inheritance in the saints.<a name=191:4></a> I believe it is the desire of the Spirit of God to bring us into the good of that inheritance <i>now</i>; that it might not be simply a question of merely being in the company of people with whom you have certain outward privileges, such as the breaking of bread, prayer meetings, reading meetings, and so forth, but that you might have the practical spiritual enjoyment of the inheritance in the circle of the saints now.<a name=191:5></a> In that circle you learn to appreciate
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		and enjoy what the blessed God has got for Himself in His redeemed, beloved people.<a name=192:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I trust, with the Lord's help, to make this more clear to you.<a name=192:2></a> I would like to give you the connection in which the Old Testament setting of the inheritance is presented.<a name=192:3></a> If I understand the book of Genesis correctly, the climax of that book is reached in chapter 22.<a name=192:4></a> I must not, however, enlarge very much on that at the moment, but it is intensely precious - I refer to the beautiful figure of Abraham and Isaac ascending the mountain where Isaac was to be offered up; but I may say in regard to it that the blessed activities of the Father and the Son, with a view to all blessing, both heavenly and earthly, are set forth there in type.<a name=192:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The foundation on which everything stands for God is the offering up of His own beloved Son; and I think it was a wonderful point when God brought out, in figure, a father's affection for his son; and yet the son of his affection was offered up as a sacrifice - a sacrifice that prefigured what Christ was, not merely as the answer to guilt, not merely as the atonement for all the sin and ruin that had been brought in, but the offering up of His Son in order that from that very spot where all the corruption and departure were, there should be a savour of eternal sweetness rising to the heart of the Father.<a name=192:6></a> It is from that spot that the Spirit of God records the blessings that were to come in through
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=193>[Page 193]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Isaac.<a name=193:1></a> Now, just to keep the connection for one moment, you will remember that at the close of chapter 22 there is a little parenthesis which gives you the generation of Rebecca, just immediately before you get the record of the death of Sarah, showing that the assembly was in view before the history of Israel was portrayed.<a name=193:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now chapter 23 gives us the record of the death of Sarah, and Abraham's purchase of a burial-ground.<a name=193:3></a> It is perhaps one of the most interesting chapters in the Old Testament, for it establishes the rights of redemption in regard to the earth, and you have the purchase price paid with the current money of the country, and the land made sure to Abraham for ever.<a name=193:4></a> Let me remind you, that piece of land is going to be demanded, and Israel shall come forth and people the earth.<a name=193:5></a> The incident is a picture of Israel, for the time being, buried; but the rights of redemption are held by the true Abraham, and He will take up those rights, and Israel will come forth and stand upon the earth, for the purchase price has been paid, the deed has been made sure, and the inheritance rightly belongs to Abraham.<a name=193:6></a> Now that is connected with the death of Sarah.<a name=193:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Chapter 24 stands between chapter 23 and the incidents recorded in chapter 25, where other families are referred to; but you will have noticed that in that chapter, Isaac gets the pre-eminent place -

	<div class="page-number">

		Abraham gave to Isaac all that he had, and before he died he sent the other families away eastward.<a name=194:1></a> The picture is beautiful: there stand Isaac and Rebecca, with all the blessing of his father in a unique and distinct position; and all the other families blessed as only Abraham could bless them, but sent away eastward.<a name=194:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the hope of our calling is connected, I think, with <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24">Genesis  24</a>; and when you come to consider the way we have to enter into it practically, you will, I think, agree that the Spirit of God has graciously given us, through Paul, the great apostle of the Gentiles, three salient epistles that deal with the subject.<a name=194:3></a> I do not at all undervalue Paul's other epistles, but the three epistles in which the heart of the apostle comes out in a distinct way, in this connection, are those to the Romans, the Colossians and the Ephesians.<a name=194:4></a> I may remind you that the apostle had not seen either the Roman, or the Colossian saints, when he wrote those epistles; he had, however, been to Ephesus, and he knew the saints there intimately.<a name=194:5></a> It is an immense thing that we should be established in these epistles with a view to entering on the hope of our calling.<a name=194:6></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Here the apostle writes to Rome, the metropolis of the world at that time, and his object in writing was to bring to light the mystery of the metropolis of God's world.<a name=195:8></a> He wrote a thesis that was to deliver the saints from this world, and put them in touch with the metropolis of God's world, to which they were to belong.<a name=195:9></a> And what was to mark them?<a name=195:10></a> They were to have the spirit of the kind of Man that God was going to people His world with.<a name=195:11></a> Now I think you have this pictured in <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24">Genesis  24</a>.<a name=195:12></a> There you have the servant explaining his exercises; his communications take the line of exercises, that he might find a wife that was suitable to his master;

		and he asked the Lord to bring him into touch with someone of the same sort of spirit as Isaac.<a name=196:1></a> What kind of spirit was that?<a name=196:2></a> The servant says, when I ask a drink, the maiden will say, "Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also" (verse 14).<a name=196:3></a> What is the gospel?<a name=196:4></a> It is the recovery of man for God.<a name=196:5></a> So the servant's exercises were not to the end that he should find someone who was very beautiful to look upon; no, but to find someone touched with the spirit of Christ.<a name=196:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Beloved, many of us profess to believe the gospel, but I ask you, how far are we each marked by the Spirit of the Man who is God's Glad Tidings?<a name=196:7></a> If you have got the Spirit of that Man, you will have no room for the display of your own spirit.<a name=196:8></a> Now, when the camels had done drinking, the servant "took a gold ring, of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands, ten shekels weight of gold" (verse 22).<a name=196:9></a> We were speaking a little of the inheritance of Moses, here you have it.<a name=196:10></a> Just imagine this damsel looking at these things, and feeling that there was now only one person for her - the one who had sent her the ring and bracelets; her hands were only to be active in the service of that one person, and her ear to listen only to his voice.<a name=196:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now I pass on for a moment to what we may see in connection with the epistle to the Colossians.<a name=196:12></a> There the apostle says, "In which are hid all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge".<a name=196:13></a>

		Now you can understand the picture in Genesis: you can understand the impression that the servant must have given of his master; there was no question whatever of what they gave to the servant; they gave him nothing; but he begins to unfold the illimitable wealth of Isaac.<a name=197:1></a> Oh, I wish we took it in.<a name=197:2></a> If a person were prepared to listen to the Spirit's account of Christ, what would impress one would be the extraordinary wealth of Christ, and what God had gained for Himself in that blessed Man.<a name=197:3></a> It was to this end that the apostle exercised himself on behalf of the saints at Colosse; he says you need not go outside Christ for anything - "For in him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily; and ye are complete in him, who is the head of all principality and authority" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:9">Colossians  2:9</a>, 10).<a name=197:4></a>

		Now when you come to consider the question of the state that is necessary in order to enter into the inheritance, and this is a point of very great importance, you will remember that what led the damsel to the conclusion that she should go with the servant was the treasure that he gave out at this particular juncture; we read, he "brought forth silver articles, and gold articles, and clothing, and he gave them to Rebecca; and he gave to her brother, and to her mother, precious things" (verse 53).<a name=197:5></a> This is the picture that the Spirit of God gives to captivate the heart for Christ, and to get you to move in your affections to the scene where Christ

		There are two prominent and simple thoughts in the Scriptures, and indeed in the chapters from which I have read, to which I wish to draw our attention.<a name=205:1></a> One is <i>the kingdom</i> and the other is <i>the way</i>.<a name=205:2></a> Not a way, nor thy way, nor yet the highway (although these are alluded to), but THE WAY.<a name=205:3></a> The kingdom has been established in order that the hearts of men might be attracted, and their feet directed into, and maintained in, <i>the way</i>, and a wonderful way it is.<a name=205:4></a> It begins with the sufferings and death of Christ, and it involves suffering and death for those who would take it.<a name=205:5></a> The path is downward, but it has a wonderful exit; an upward one.<a name=205:6></a> The exit of that way leads to glory.<a name=205:7></a>

		We have just been singing together of a journey that ends in the rest above, and in the simplest possible way I want to suggest a thought or two in regard to the greatness of our resources, if, in taking that journey to the other side, we are travelling in a ship with Christ, and have <i>no more than one loaf</i>.<a name=227:1></a> One loaf may seem a meagre supply for a company of people embarking on a journey such as that, but only a natural man would reason in that way, because a natural man needs his eyes opened to see the greatness of Christ.<a name=227:2></a> He needs a double touch, like the man at Bethsaida mentioned in this chapter, in order that when the Lord interrogates, as He does the disciples in the incident following, "Who do ye say that I am?<a name=227:3></a>" (verse 29), he may not answer according to the judgment of the people, "John the baptist; and others, Elias; but others, One of the prophets" (though great men indeed), but may, like Peter, look only at Him and say, 'Thou art the transcendent Man; there is none like Thee;' "Thou art the Christ".<a name=227:4></a>

		I am sure we all feel grateful to God for the line of ministry which has come before us today, in connection with Elijah and Elisha, and as we have had brought before us this evening already, Elijah stood here almost alone for the rights of God, and what a lovely type he was of Christ Himself, who stood here for those rights, who maintained them all through His pathway here, and who vindicated them at all cost to Himself by going into death!<a name=243:1></a> It was such a Man as the Lord Jesus whom heaven could claim.<a name=243:2></a> Earth refused Him, but God said, "Sit at my right hand until I have put thine enemies to be the footstool of thy feet" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:34">Acts  2:34</a>, 35).<a name=243:3></a> As having that unique place at the right hand of God, it was His pleasure to give the Holy Spirit.<a name=243:4></a> The one supreme act of Christ consequent upon His exaltation was to give the Spirit.<a name=243:5></a> We can hardly estimate the value of that precious act of the Lord Jesus in receiving from the Father the promise of the Spirit and shedding Him forth upon the disciples.<a name=243:6></a>

		double portion of the spirit which he desired, was made dependent upon his seeing Elijah go up.<a name=244:1></a> We can understand with what interest, and with what affection, Elisha would watch, would attend upon every footstep and every movement of Elijah, and how that when the time came for the translation, he could cry out, "My father, my father!<a name=244:2></a> the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof!<a name=244:3></a>" (<a href="../bible/2Kings.htm#2:12">2 Kings  2:12</a>).<a name=244:4></a>

		How it typifies that which we find in the New Testament, to which reference was made.<a name=244:5></a> The disciples were led out, the Lord led them out to Bethany, and in the attitude of blessing them, He was separated from them.<a name=244:6></a> There was a reluctance, in a sense, to go, "He was separated from them and was carried up into heaven" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#24:51">Luke  24:51</a>), and their affectionate attention was toward Christ.<a name=244:7></a> They saw Him go up, and that attention was continued, we might say, during the ten days that they waited upon God in prayer, until the double portion of the Spirit was poured out upon them.<a name=244:8></a> Now the Spirit has come, this is the Spirit's time.<a name=244:9></a> It is a great thing to know the character of the moment.<a name=244:10></a> It is the time when the Spirit is given without measure to us, and because of our intimate connection with Christ, as being the counterpart of that blessed Man, there should be with us the exercise as to how far we are in the good of the Spirit.<a name=244:11></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the scriptures I read suggest four thoughts.<a name=245:6></a> They present the Spirit in four characters - as the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of sonship, and the Spirit of resurrection.<a name=245:7></a> I want briefly to go over those points.<a name=245:8></a> In the first verse read you will notice that the Spirit of God is placed in direct contrast to the flesh, so the apostle says, "<i>Ye</i> are not in flesh but in Spirit, if indeed God's Spirit dwell in you".<a name=245:9></a> He raises the question as to the indwelling Spirit, and, provided the Spirit is there, there is the thought of our being not now in the flesh but in the Spirit.<a name=245:10></a> Now when the Spirit takes up His abode in us, depend upon it, a great deal has to be done.<a name=245:11></a> I believe the thought of God's Spirit taking up His dwelling in us is in view of complete subjugation to Christ.<a name=245:12></a> Hence He comes into the believer's body with the thought of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The flesh does not like it.<a name=246:2></a> The flesh has had its place there too long to relish finding some One else there having superior power, and for this reason resists that power.<a name=246:3></a> Hence we read, "The flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these things are opposed one to the other, that ye should not do those things which ye desire" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#5:17">Galatians  5:17</a>).<a name=246:4></a> Thus the Spirit is on the side of victory, and the flesh is subdued by His power.<a name=246:5></a> When we think of the almighty power of God's Spirit it is a wonder that we are so much in the flesh, for there is an almighty power in the Holy Spirit to subdue the flesh, so that we are brought into the blessed domain of the Spirit, and we are said to be "in Spirit".<a name=246:6></a> "<i>Ye</i> are not in flesh but in Spirit, if indeed God's Spirit dwell in you".<a name=246:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then I think that where the Spirit has assumed supremacy and is in perfect control, He is free to be in us as "the Spirit of Christ", as the Spirit of that blessed Man.<a name=246:8></a> The Spirit of God came upon Jesus in bodily shape like a dove and rested in complacency there, and, having been upon Jesus during His ministry here, the One by whom the Lord Jesus accomplished everything, He now takes that character in us, and can take it, as the Spirit of Christ.<a name=246:9></a> He is so blended, if I might use that word, with all that Christ was as Man here, that He can be

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Formation then is by the Spirit of Christ.<a name=247:3></a> I will tell you what the Spirit of Christ delights to do, He delights to present Christ to us.<a name=247:4></a> That is His great thought to present to us the Christ of the gospels.<a name=247:5></a> I would commend the reading of the gospels to you, because they bring before us (and the Spirit delights to do it <i>livingly</i>) that blessed Man.<a name=247:6></a> Whether you read Matthew, Mark, Luke or John, that blessed Man is presented to us by the Spirit.<a name=247:7></a> He testifies of Christ, He brings His beauties and glories before our wondering hearts, so that we are entranced with Christ Himself, and, as we are under the influence of Christ, by the Spirit, we are formed by the Spirit after that Man so that there is another Man now, it is not Adam but Christ.<a name=247:8></a>

		The new section of Romans begins at chapter 6 (chapters 6 to 8 are all one section), we are taught there to <i>reckon</i> ourselves dead to sin (as a dominating principle) and alive unto God in Christ Jesus.<a name=247:9></a> But it is as <i>formed</i> after Christ that we really derive from Him, and can rightly regard ourselves as in Christ Jesus.<a name=247:10></a> The truth of being "in Christ Jesus", however, is not developed in this epistle.<a name=247:11></a>

		Turning again for a moment to the gospels, as you well know, each gospel ends with the death of Christ.<a name=248:1></a> That blessed Man not only gave a new setting to manhood (for He was a Man of another order entirely), but He was capable of making God known, and where was God made known?<a name=248:2></a> Partially in His ministry here, but God was fully made known in the death of Christ.<a name=248:3></a> In Matthew we have presented the sin-offering, in Mark, possibly the trespass-offering, in Luke the meat-offering and in John the burnt-offering; each gospel reaching a point of consummation in His precious death.<a name=248:4></a>

		Thus there was the consummation of the holy, blessed life of Jesus in a sacrificial way in death, and there it was that the love of God was fully and perfectly declared.<a name=248:5></a> In that blessed Man we have then the setting forth of what man should be, and of what God is, and we can understand how easy it is to love that Man, and to love the God whom He declared.<a name=248:6></a> Now when that is brought to pass in us by the Holy Spirit our responsibility, our every obligation upon earth, is fulfilled, because we carry out the law's righteous requirements.<a name=248:7></a> They showed that the fulfilment of the law was love - love to God and love to one's neighbour (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#22:37">Matthew  22:37</a> - 40).<a name=248:8></a> As the result of formation, we love God and His blessed Son, that blessed holy Man who magnified the law, and made it honourable, and if you love Christ it is not difficult to love those who are

		I will now say a word about the Spirit of sonship, because we are carried beyond what is required on earth, as connected with our responsibility, in the Spirit of sonship.<a name=249:5></a> In <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4">Galatians  4</a>we have the Spirit of God's Son.<a name=249:6></a> The Spirit of God's Son is there spoken of as being sent out "into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father" (verse 6).<a name=249:7></a> There it says the <i>Spirit</i> cries, "Abba, Father;" but the verse I read in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>is an advance on that.<a name=249:8></a> It says, "For ye have not received a spirit of bondage again for fear, but ye have received a spirit of adoption, (or sonship, see note <i>g</i>) whereby we cry, Abba, Father".<a name=249:9></a> In Galatians, there is a capital 'S' to the word Spirit, but in the verse we read there is a small 's' to the word spirit, suggesting I believe that the Spirit of God is so blended with our spirit, that our state and the Spirit are one.<a name=249:10></a> He is the Spirit of sonship, and we are in the good of sonship; we know our association with God's Son; we are in the liberty and dignity of our place before God as belonging to the family of God, and now we cry, "Abba, Father".<a name=249:11></a> What a wonderful result for the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I ask whether you do not think that a few such saints, dwelling in any town or village, would be an asset to that town or village?<a name=250:4></a> Think of Elisha, wherever he went, there were works of grace and power.<a name=250:5></a> Grace was active in power in Elisha.<a name=250:6></a> He brought new things, wonderful things to pass.<a name=250:7></a> Want disappeared wherever he went, and there was wonderful excess in all that he did.<a name=250:8></a> If only a few saints in a given place were in the good of what we have been speaking about, I believe we should have the antitype of Elisha in that district.<a name=250:9></a> That is what God is looking for, that is what Christ desires and what the Spirit would bring about - that there should be found here, that which answers to the spirit of grace and of power, as typified in the ministry of Elisha, that there should be a reproduction of Christ here through the assembly in the way of grace and power toward men in blessing.<a name=250:10></a>

		Now it is a very interesting thing to trace any idea to its source, and as you read the first chapter of Genesis, you find that the idea of regulation is introduced with the sun.<a name=253:4></a> There is no regulating feature found in anything before the sun was set in the heavens.<a name=253:5></a> It says, "The great light to rule the day, and the small light to rule the night" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:16">Genesis  1:16</a>), and in this respect the sun becomes a most beautiful type of Christ.<a name=253:6></a> He is the "Great light".<a name=253:7></a> He is to rule.<a name=253:8></a> That is nothing new to you, but it is interesting to see that one of the first thoughts introduced in connection with the sun is rule, or regulation.<a name=253:9></a>

		I was thinking that the most conspicuous object perhaps, in the present creation of God, is the sun, and yet little attention is paid to it.<a name=254:1></a> It certainly is so in the moral universe, applying it to Christ.<a name=254:2></a> Think of the glory and greatness of Christ, and yet how comparatively little He is noticed!<a name=254:3></a> How do you regard the sun?<a name=254:4></a> Do you look upon it as astronomers do in the world?<a name=254:5></a> It suggests nothing moral to them.<a name=254:6></a> They find enough in it to satisfy their own curiosity and they have invented instruments to calculate the distance from the sun to the earth, and all that sort of thing, but it is all made to enhance the glory of fallen man.<a name=254:7></a> He gazes into the sun and he delivers a lecture, and he gazes yet again and writes a book, and the more he gazes the more he sees.<a name=254:8></a> It is contributing glory to man.<a name=254:9></a> But think of David, he looks up yonder and he says; "The heavens declare the glory of God; and the expanse sheweth the work of his hands" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#19:1">Psalm  19:1</a>).<a name=254:10></a> And when his eyes rest on the sun (and he seems to linger there) he says; "He is as a bridegroom" (verse 5) - a bridegroom - a man expressive of all that goes to make up life and affection.<a name=254:11></a>

		It has been a great cheer to me, dear brethren, in these meetings to feel that the Spirit of God has brought before us the adjustment between what is objective and what is subjective.<a name=259:1></a> I suppose we all understand the words.<a name=259:2></a> Many of us have used them for years.<a name=259:3></a> I understand that if we speak of objective truth, it is what we can see in Christ - what God has displayed in Christ - set before us for our appropriation in Him; whereas subjective truth is rather connected with what is wrought in our own souls, what God works in us by the Spirit.<a name=259:4></a> I think that God has been very especially calling our attention to the fact that the two should agree.<a name=259:5></a>

		I read this first portion in Corinthians just to point out the kind of people to whom the apostle Paul addressed his closing verse.<a name=259:6></a> They were a people that we might call <i>recovered</i>.<a name=259:7></a> He had to write to them a very corrective epistle because of their conduct.<a name=259:8></a> In this second epistle he is able to speak of their recovery: they had sorrowed with a godly sorrow and Paul could express his joy in hearing the effect of the truth he had given them.<a name=259:9></a> Now we who are here today professedly take the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We take the ground of being recovered, and of desiring to be here for the pleasure of God.<a name=260:3></a> I am sure we take this ground.<a name=260:4></a> We profess to be separated from the enclosures of human systems, from the enclosures of the world, and to be seeking to be here for the pleasure of God.<a name=260:5></a> Now, in view of that, I just want to say a few words about this last verse.<a name=260:6></a> I think it is a verse of which, as in the case of the Lord's prayer - the prayer that the Lord taught His disciples - we have somewhat missed the blessing, because it is so misused in other circles.<a name=260:7></a> It is so often used in a formal religious way when professing companies of believers are together, but it is a beautiful verse, a verse which suggests to us all the activities of the Godhead, all the divine activities towards His people.<a name=260:8></a> The apostle, from his heart, desires for those to whom he writes that they might know, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit".<a name=260:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I would like first to say a word as to these activities in what I might call an objective way.<a name=260:10></a> Scripture speaks of "Christ's day" (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#1:10">Philippians  1:10</a>); it speaks also of "the day of God" (<a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#3:12">2 Peter  3:12</a>); and it

		indicates, as we have so often had before us, that the day in which we live is the 'day of the Spirit'.<a name=261:1></a> "Christ's day" refers to what is commonly called 'the millennium;' the day when the Lord Jesus Christ will have His rights and reign over this world, when all that Satan has brought into this scene - his works - will be undone, and when this world will be governed according to the mind of God.<a name=261:2></a> I think that is the day when "the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ" will be manifested.<a name=261:3></a> It will be brought in by power, but it will be maintained by grace.<a name=261:4></a> I think in that day we shall manifestly see grace reigning through righteousness - and do not our hearts anticipate that day?<a name=261:5></a> Do we not find ourselves, in view of all that is happening in the world around, longing for the day when the Lord Jesus Christ will have His rightful place, when peace will be permanently established, and when every trace of the enemy's work, speaking broadly, will be done away?<a name=261:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Are we not reminded in our daily lives, and by many an occurrence in our lives, of what sin has wrought in the world?<a name=261:7></a> Our brother has brought before us how the Lord mourned over the terrible effects of sin, how it caused Him to groan, in that sin had brought death into the world.<a name=261:8></a> Sin has indeed brought sorrow and death into this scene; and it does not matter what circle we touch, what subject connected with the present order of things occupies

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When we turn to the Old Testament Scriptures, how our hearts rejoice over the descriptions there of the world to come, of what a change will be wrought upon this earth in connection with the government and the reign of the Lord Jesus Christ, and of how He is going to reign in grace; for grace will reign through righteousness.<a name=262:2></a> Everything in that scene will be influenced by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ; because I take it that the thousand years of that 'day' will be the answer to all that Satan and sin have wrought during these thousands of years.<a name=262:3></a> That thousand years will be God's answer to it all and a manifestation of His victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=262:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, it says "the love of God;" I do not think I am straining the application if I apply that expression objectively to the time when God will "be all in all" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:28">1 Corinthians  15:28</a>), when there will be a new heaven and a new earth - the time about which Scripture says very little.<a name=262:5></a> Then that which God is (that is love), will characterise His whole universe.<a name=262:6></a> "God is love" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:8">1 John  4:8</a>).<a name=262:7></a> That is an absolute statement, as expressing the nature of God; and I think that in the eternal state all we now know in connection with the love of God, and the revelation of the Father - all that we now know of love as belonging to that company of sons whom the Lord

	<div class="paragraph">
		Jesus Christ is leading to the Father - will be permanently established for God, in the day of God, the great day of finality that God brings in.<a name=263:1></a> You remember Peter speaks of it: "The elements, burning with heat, .<a name=263:2></a>.<a name=263:3></a>.<a name=263:4></a> But, according to his promise, we wait for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwells righteousness" (<a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#3:10">2 Peter  3:10</a> - 13).<a name=263:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I think these things are objective for us.<a name=263:6></a> We see these days portrayed in Scripture, Christ's day and the day of God.<a name=263:7></a> We know too, and are very happy in knowing, that this is the day of the Spirit, of which we can also speak objectively.<a name=263:8></a> This is the day of the Spirit; the Spirit of God is really here.<a name=263:9></a> He is here for the good of God's people, to maintain something for God, and He will maintain it to the end.<a name=263:10></a> I think that is objective, that the Spirit of God will maintain here upon earth until the Lord Jesus Christ comes, that which is for the pleasure of God.<a name=263:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then I think that the activities spoken of may be viewed subjectively.<a name=263:12></a> The apostle says, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ".<a name=263:13></a> That is, I take it, he desires for the Corinthians, to whom he writes, that the spirit of grace - that power, that influence, through which He will keep and control the world to come - might be effectual in the Corinthians; and the love of God, which will permeate the scene in the day of God, when God will be all in all, might be known in the hearts of God's people.<a name=263:14></a> It is not the power that brings these things into existence.<a name=263:15></a> He

		does not desire for them that they should know the power by which the world to come will be brought to pass - the power that will make a new heaven and new earth - he desires that the spiritual influence, the very characteristics of these divine Persons, might be known in their hearts.<a name=264:1></a> It is not the fact there is a divine Person here, that he desires them to know, but that the communion, the fellowship, the gracious influence of the Spirit of God, might affect their souls.<a name=264:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I delight to think that the whole power of the Godhead - the full activities of the Godhead - are ever at work for the good of His people, to maintain us for the pleasure of God now; and to know that the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, that will bring such wonderful things into existence in the future, as well as the power of the Spirit of God, are well able to maintain something for God against the frightful and fearful power of the enemy at the present time.<a name=264:3></a> It was these things, contained in this last verse, the apostle desired for a recovered company.<a name=264:4></a> He would desire them for us, yea, God would desire them for us, that we might know, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ".<a name=264:5></a> Have we not had it before us in the way He dealt with things here?<a name=264:6></a> Have we not had it before us in the way He dealt with His servants and those with whom He came in contact when here upon earth?<a name=264:7></a> That "grace of the Lord Jesus Christ!<a name=264:8></a>"

		Well, He is going to influence the whole world in a coming day, and when He does, everything evil and everything painful and everything sorrowful will disappear; and I suppose that, if we knew more of "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ" now, it would remove a great many of the difficulties which beset us.<a name=265:1></a> Of the love of God we know but little, but God has given us to touch it in connection with our spiritual privileges and it will characterise the whole eternal state - "the love of God".<a name=265:2></a> Finally "the communion of the Holy Spirit" - that which binds us together now; communion of Him who is active amongst us having come to these meetings; who delights to take of the things of Christ and show them to us.<a name=265:3></a> These things the apostle desires for us, as he desired them for these recovered Corinthians, and I am sure the Spirit of God would give the word to us, so that it might be a real word for our cheer and encouragement.<a name=265:4></a> God desires that these gracious influences might be known in our hearts even now.<a name=265:5></a>

		It will not be difficult, beloved friends, to perceive the line of connection in the scriptures which I have read to you.<a name=267:1></a> The idea of the city has a very large place in the scriptures, and the first scripture we have read relates to a city which belonged to a <i>past</i> day; the second scripture to a city which is morally extant today, and the third a city yet <i>to come</i>, as to actuality and publicity.<a name=267:2></a> I am sure it is the thought and intention of God that we should become acquainted with the ideas that are mapped out in the thought of a city.<a name=267:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will notice that in connection with each city which we have cited, you have a mountain, and I think that is characteristic of the city as presented by God.<a name=267:4></a> When you have the divine city brought into evidence you will find there is a mountain near by, because the kind of city which God introduces is that which <i>He</i> builds.<a name=267:5></a> You may depend upon it that it is characterized by stability.<a name=267:6></a> There was no mountain in the vicinity of Cain's city.<a name=267:7></a> There was no mountain near the city that was reared on the plains of Shinar, because the city that was the product of man, as departed from God, has no

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=268>[Page 268]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		foundation.<a name=268:1></a> There is no stability.<a name=268:2></a> The feature of durability is absolutely absent in connection with the kind of city that man is building, but if God proposes to design and build a city you may depend upon it that that city has moral foundations.<a name=268:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the first suggestion that we get in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#87">Psalm  87</a>is that of holy mountains; God's foundation is in the maintenance of holiness.<a name=268:4></a> You may depend upon it that the kind of foundation that God selects is a foundation which is in every way in harmony with what He is, in His own blessed nature and character.<a name=268:5></a> I would suggest that every person who has received the Spirit (as we were hearing today) has received, in principle, in initial form, every divine quality that has come within the range of revelation, and I would suggest that every such person in a kind of way is a mountain.<a name=268:6></a> God is establishing His foundation in the souls of people who have been brought, in some measure, into moral accord with the revelation of Himself, and they are thus constituted mountains.<a name=268:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What I understand by a mountain is elevation.<a name=268:8></a> I judge that every person so marked off by the Spirit of God has all the possibilities of a holy mountain there.<a name=268:9></a> That, in principle, is true, but like everything else it has to be developed, and there are all the possibilities of the holy elevation, that which reaches in the direction of heaven, and that which draws from heaven, and makes the plain, so to
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=269>[Page 269]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		speak, a fit place to live in.<a name=269:1></a> There could be no circle here in which a believer could live, were it not for the presence of the holy mountains, were it not for the presence in this scene of men who are drawing down the dew of heaven.<a name=269:2></a> In natural things, the fertility of the plains largely hangs upon the elevations; and the thought of God in regard of every one of us, is that there might be moral increase, that these elevations might rise, that they might tower up, as it were, that they might reflect that scene from whence all divine and heavenly refreshment comes.<a name=269:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That was the kind of location that this wonderful city had.<a name=269:4></a> It was a city surrounded by holy mountains.<a name=269:5></a> It was in that way a city of fertility, of refreshment, and, as we said, it was a city which had moral foundations.<a name=269:6></a> Now, whilst it is true that the city that is cited in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#87">Psalm  87</a>is a material city, and that which we have in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12">Hebrews  12</a>is moral, as also in the book of Revelation, I think we find that what is said of the city in a material way in the Old Testament is merely an index to what lies in the mind of God in regard of this moral and spiritual order of things, which He is building today.<a name=269:7></a> So that really the kinds of things that God was building into the souls of His saints in the Old Testament, were not morally different, in kind or quality, from those which He is building into your soul and mine.<a name=269:8></a> I know that the way in which these things went into
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=270>[Page 270]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		their souls was different, and that it went into their souls in a different form, under a different testimony, but I think the quality, the nature of the things which God was building into the souls of His people in the past dispensation, is not different in kind or quality from that which He is building into our souls today.<a name=270:1></a> I judge that God, at no period in the history of His ways, would build into the souls of men other than that which was morally Himself.<a name=270:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So when we come to the consideration of these cities, we find that there is no great distance apart from them as to their moral substance.<a name=270:3></a> "Jehovah loveth the gates of Zion more than all the habitations of Jacob".<a name=270:4></a> God loves the habitations of Jacob.<a name=270:5></a> He loves the habitations of all His people.<a name=270:6></a> God has a peculiar interest in all that relates to the pathway of His people, and He takes account of their dwellings, of their uprisings and their down-sittings, but "Jehovah loveth the gates of Zion more than all the habitations of Jacob".<a name=270:7></a> Why?<a name=270:8></a> Because these are beautiful gates.<a name=270:9></a> No city that has ever been raised by man could compare with the moral beauty that shines in the gates of Zion, because in these gates there is a kind of administration, there is a kind of wisdom, that is unknown in the cities of man.<a name=270:10></a> But the kind of wisdom that is operating in Zion is really the wisdom of God, and so He loves the gates of Zion.<a name=270:11></a> He loves the kind of administration that is carried on there, and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=271>[Page 271]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		according to <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12">Hebrews  12</a>we have arrived at Mount Zion, the city of the living God; and because that city is morally existent today (that is, in arriving in our spirits at Christ risen, and taking account of the saints as risen together with Him) we arrive at a spiritual and moral system which is really the product of God.<a name=271:1></a> So that here today there are men who have come under the influence of heaven; Zion is near to heaven, and all these heavenly things are really within the reach of our spirits now in Zion.<a name=271:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The kind of wisdom that comes from above is found operating in the gates of Zion, and God has a peculiar regard for the kind of wisdom that is expressed, the kind of wisdom that is applied in the gates of Zion.<a name=271:3></a> All the wisdom of this world is incomparable with the kind of wisdom that operates in the gates of Zion.<a name=271:4></a> God has a peculiar interest in the kind of wisdom that is being applied to moral problems down here today, because it is really the appropriation and application of divine wisdom, the kind of wisdom that resides in Christ, the One whom God has made Head and in whom all the wisdom of God is found.<a name=271:5></a> That is the kind of wisdom, that is found in the gates of Zion, and that is the kind of wisdom that God loves to see operating down here.<a name=271:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So today we find there are moral problems arising.<a name=271:7></a> You take all these local difficulties that arise.<a name=271:8></a> They will come, and I am encouraged to think

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=272>[Page 272]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that God is proving us through these difficulties, by the application now of divine wisdom, the kind of wisdom that is found in the gates of Zion.<a name=272:1></a> I say God is educating us in order that we might come out in administration in that city when it is publicly displayed.<a name=272:2></a> So, while I am sure it is very distasteful to us to have to meet these difficulties that arise, from time to time, on the other hand, I would be encouraged in this thought, that God is making use of these difficulties and is educating us through them, that by the introduction of divine wisdom there might be the building up in our souls now, of that which will fit us, and make us competent, to come out in connection with the administration of the city in a public way by and by.<a name=272:3></a> The persons that are born in Zion have a kind of character that is peculiar to that city.<a name=272:4></a> People usually bear the stamp and character of the city in which they are born.<a name=272:5></a> It usually imparts a tone and character to them, and people usually have a great regard, and a great love, for the city in which they are born; and I want to ask you, when God numbers the people, when He takes the census, if one might so speak, will He be able to record of us that we have been born in Zion?<a name=272:6></a> Will it be said in regard of us that we have been born in that wonderful city?<a name=272:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		there.<a name=273:1></a> But I am thinking now of the way this works out practically today, as to whether we have come under the moral influence of Zion, as to whether we carry the moral character which is stamped upon a man born there, because I do not think, beloved friends, it will be difficult to recognise a 'man born in Zion'.<a name=273:2></a> He will carry with him a moral dignity, and will carry with him an air of liberty which belongs to that city.<a name=273:3></a> There are two qualities which I think would mark a man born in Zion - the elements of rest and contentment.<a name=273:4></a> Now these are two elements which are absolutely unknown in the city of man today.<a name=273:5></a> There never was a moment perhaps in the history of this world when discontent and unrest were so evident as now, but God proposes to introduce our souls into a sphere, into a city, where everything is marked by rest and contentment.<a name=273:6></a> The people who are the moral product of that wonderful city are a restful, happy, contented people, and I think there is no greater evidence in the world today as to the reality and blessedness of divine things than the presence of these qualities in the souls of God's people.<a name=273:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"They that dwell in thy house: they will be constantly praising thee" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#84:4">Psalm  84:4</a>), and, whilst the city and the house may be different thoughts, I presume the same moral state is involved in both these ideas, and really what makes the city of Zion such an important and such a blessed city is the

	<div class="paragraph">
		presence of the house of God, because that is where God dwells.<a name=274:1></a> He dwells in that city.<a name=274:2></a> Now there may be other cities.<a name=274:3></a> We have some of them mentioned in the fourth verse of our psalm, but the principles of confusion attach to these cities.<a name=274:4></a> The world's cities are scenes of moral darkness.<a name=274:5></a> They are marked by lawlessness.<a name=274:6></a> The very first city that was reared in this world, its very foundations were laid in murder, and the principles of hatred and death mark the cities of men.<a name=274:7></a> But the cities of Rahab (Egypt) will be brought down.<a name=274:8></a> Babylon will be brought down, because there are no moral foundations, but the city that God is rearing today, that which He is building up in the souls of His people, is of such a character that it will not permit of destruction.<a name=274:9></a> Everything that God builds up in connection with Zion, is durable and eternal in its qualities and character, and it is of the greatest encouragement to think that out of all this chaos, this world of confusion and death, God is building up in the souls of His people that which is of Himself, that which is eternal in character, and which will survive the break-up of everything that man has built.<a name=274:10></a>

		I read the passages in Zephaniah because I felt that, inasmuch as they describe the comfort vouchsafed to the remnant in a trying day, just at the close of a dispensation, they are applicable to our hearts at a moment like this.<a name=285:2></a> So in chapter 2, the prophet addresses himself to those set for the Lord's interests.<a name=285:3></a> "Seek Jehovah, all ye meek of the land, who have performed his ordinance; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of Jehovah's anger".<a name=285:4></a> It reminds one of what the Lord says to Philadelphia, "Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee out of the hour of trial, which is about to come upon the whole habitable world, to try them that dwell upon the earth".<a name=285:5></a>

		I should like to say a word or two, with the Lord's help, to confirm what the Lord has graciously brought before us, in regard of the importance of the two signs which the Lord said would be given.<a name=295:1></a> He said no sign should be given to an evil and adulterous generation save the sign of Jonas the prophet, who was in the belly of the great fish three days and three nights; and He said when He announced that, "Behold, more than Jonas is here" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#12:41">Matthew  12:41</a>).<a name=295:2></a> Then He spoke of the queen of the south as another sign, and added, "Behold, more than Solomon is here" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#12:42">Matthew  12:42</a>).<a name=295:3></a> I would suggest that the value of these two signs, known in their reality in the apprehension of Christ in this twofold way, would leave the soul free to contemplate, and appreciate, and enjoy, the immensity of the revelation that the Father made to Peter.<a name=295:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have no doubt whatever that what is characteristic of the present moment in God's eye is the fact that the Son of God has come.<a name=295:5></a> The coming of the Son of God must make a tremendous change

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		With that in view, I would like to draw attention to the importance of these two signs.<a name=296:7></a> The first is, plainly and distinctly, the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=296:8></a> One can hardly understand Jonah; for when God gave him a message for that great and wicked city, he felt that if he carried the message, the city would break down under it and God would bless them; and he did not want them blessed; he wanted his testimony of coming judgment to be vindicated.<a name=296:9></a> He did not know what it was to be in sympathy with the heart of God.<a name=296:10></a>

		Well, you say, that entails the spirit of another Man, and for that reason I would like to touch on the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=298:1></a> Matthew gives us what should be brought about in the soul by death and resurrection.<a name=298:2></a> I do not mean that he puts us in the full gain of it, but he indicates what ought to be the effect of it in our soul's history.<a name=298:3></a> "Jesus, having again cried with a loud voice, gave up the ghost".<a name=298:4></a> That is His death - the death of Jesus.<a name=298:5></a> That is one part of the sign of Jonas, and the effect is wonderful: the veil of the temple - of the house - was rent in two from the top to the bottom.<a name=298:6></a> Marvellous!<a name=298:7></a> every barrier that hinders the light and all the blessedness that was in God coming out unhinderedly, gone for ever!<a name=298:8></a> There was not a barrier left.<a name=298:9></a> If that is the effect of His death, what is to be the effect of His resurrection?<a name=298:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is more than that effected by His death; resurrection is the basis upon which God is going to establish everything: "The rocks were rent, and the tombs were opened; and many bodies of the saints fallen asleep arose, and going out of the tombs after His arising, entered into the holy city".<a name=298:11></a> That is resurrection; mark, it says, <i>after His</i> arising.<a name=298:12></a> Wonderful!<a name=298:13></a> Just think of it.<a name=298:14></a> His death has removed every barrier, and the full light of God comes out, so that we are not surprised that the gospel is said to be the power of God unto salvation.<a name=298:15></a>

		Speaking reverently, God can now, in righteousness, do just what He pleases; and thus we have actually brought before us the thought of people outside of death, outside the grave, perfectly suitable to God, walking about in the holy city.<a name=299:1></a> The last reference to this city was anything but holy; the last reference to it was a great sorrow to the heart of God; but now the effect of the death of His Son, and His resurrection, is that the city, purged in the sight of God by the efficacy of that marvellous death, is looked upon as a holy city; and those who are made partakers of a holy calling are walking about in it outside of death.<a name=299:2></a>

		I desire to say a word or two as to the constitution of the church as Christ's assembly here.<a name=309:1></a> I am taking it for granted that everyone present has part in that, and I would just say in passing that the assembly is composed of every person who believes in the God who raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead, and who has received the Spirit - that is our side of it.<a name=309:2></a> God has given an adequate testimony to encourage us to have our faith and hope in Him, in that He has raised Christ from the dead and given Him glory.<a name=309:3></a>

		He appeals to that faith of the believer that trusts in Him, He gives him too His Spirit, as I have said, and that gives him part in the assembly.<a name=309:4></a> But while that is true of every believer, yet every believer does not know what it is to be <i>intelligently</i> a part of the assembly.<a name=309:5></a> Now, when I say intelligently, I do not mean as a matter of mind only, but as a matter of usefulness.<a name=309:6></a> Take an illustration: - I have a man working in my office and I want to write a letter - I say, 'Do you know shorthand?<a name=309:7></a>' 'Yes', he says, and he takes it down as

		I speak.<a name=310:1></a> He becomes useful to me because of his intelligence in shorthand.<a name=310:2></a> I think you can understand, the assembly is set here for a special purpose, and every person who composes, or forms part of it intelligently, becomes available for that service.<a name=310:3></a> I have no doubt Apollos was a remarkable man, but he was not intelligent in relation to the assembly, he only knew John's baptism, and hence he lacked in efficiency for use among the people of God, but he was instructed more perfectly, and so his usefulness was increased.<a name=310:4></a> I covet that every believer might be as useful as a believer can be.<a name=310:5></a> In view of that it is important that we should be intelligent as to what it is to form a part of the assembly in its moral constitution, and it is with that object in view that I read <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16">Psalm  16</a>.<a name=310:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is the first of a series of psalms that come in in connection with God's glory.<a name=310:7></a> We start at that point and the finish on that line is in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#24">Psalm  24</a>.<a name=310:8></a> On the way all the questions in which need for usefulness arises are taken up and settled.<a name=310:9></a> This we find in the intervening psalms, and the series closes with the gates of glory open, and the Man of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#16">Psalm  16</a>goes in; and not only Himself personally, but as the Lord of hosts; that is, there are millions go in too.<a name=310:10></a> That, speaking reverently, is the consequence of Christ having come into Manhood.<a name=310:11></a> One could not conceive anything more wonderful than the moment when there was one holy Man on this earth.<a name=310:12></a>

		He was here entirely for the pleasure of God, He walked in absolute dependence upon God.<a name=311:1></a> "Preserve me, O God: for I trust in thee".<a name=311:2></a> I believe, beloved brethren, the great contrast to that is the feature which marks the present moment; man says, 'I take very good care of myself;' he thinks he has a right to do this, and alas!<a name=311:3></a> it is the principle of his being to think so.<a name=311:4></a> What I seek to show you is this: the blessedness of Christ in the way He was here for His Father's business.<a name=311:5></a> He was always ready to bring to light every thought that was in the heart of God for man.<a name=311:6></a> You could understand that suffering and sorrow came across His pathway, but He would answer, in the language of the psalm, "The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places".<a name=311:7></a> So subject was He to the hand of Jehovah, that even in the most trying circumstances He could say, "Yea, I have a goodly heritage".<a name=311:8></a>

		truth of the assembly.<a name=312:1></a> What will be the result of this?<a name=312:2></a> Well take the close of the psalm - the light in the soul that God's great end will be reached.<a name=312:3></a> "Thou wilt make known to me the path of life: .<a name=312:4></a>.<a name=312:5></a>.<a name=312:6></a> at thy right hand are pleasures for evermore".<a name=312:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The constitution of the assembly is that it is of Christ, and to reach that in our souls we have to come intelligently to know what it is to be formed spiritually after Him.<a name=312:8></a> You say, 'I don't think that will ever be brought to pass with me'.<a name=312:9></a> It depends on who is going to bring it to pass; it depends on the workman, and so when the apostle touches upon it in Ephesians, he has to explain that it is not human workmanship, it is the fruit of divine operations - God's workmanship.<a name=312:10></a> How marvellous this is!<a name=312:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there are three things necessary in order to bring this to pass intelligently in any believer.<a name=312:12></a> First, the condition in which you are here.<a name=312:13></a> Do not think beloved, get it dismissed from your mind, that these things are brought about in a sentimental way; that will not do.<a name=312:14></a> God begins to work simply and effectually with the material in hand, and when He has done, you would scarcely recognise the material.<a name=312:15></a> It is the same person, in the same body - and you cannot take account of the person apart from the body and by what you see coming out in that body - but there is moral transformation.<a name=312:16></a> If I see you strike a person, I come to the conclusion that you are a violent person, if you speak harshly,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=313>[Page 313]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		that you are a harsh person, but if persecuted you bless, I form my conclusions by the way the vessel acts.<a name=313:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God steps on the scene, He is going to have material, He begins to work in such a blessed way that He actually brings to pass in that person a yielding up of that body to Him; you say, 'That would rob me of my truest hopes and aspirations', but listen, you would have higher hopes and better aspirations.<a name=313:2></a> Before God asks you to relinquish, He impresses you with the fact that He could glorify you, and you cannot glorify yourself.<a name=313:3></a> You know He justified you, but He can glorify you, and He has set His love upon you; you are thus moved by the compassions of God, and with His thoughts, and you begin to realise that God can do a great deal better with that body than you could yourself.<a name=313:4></a> Then you present that body - the hand that struck, the tongue that spoke - you give it to God to do just as He likes with.<a name=313:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That is very simple, and now you begin to see in the same person, with the same body, little actions and movements that were never seen there before.<a name=313:6></a> Perhaps the person who was first out of the room after the gospel preaching stays to shake hands with the brethren.<a name=313:7></a> What does that mean to God?<a name=313:8></a> He looks down to see the fruit of His grace in that man's hand.<a name=313:9></a> He is writing home to his mother to say, 'I thoroughly appreciate the brethren, I am

		at the meeting as often as I can get'.<a name=314:1></a> The secret is, God has captured that person - that body - and, do not be discouraged when I say that the gospel has not had its full effect on a person until that person is at the disposal of God with regard to his body.<a name=314:2></a> God works also by bringing the moral beauty of Christ before you, and you say, 'I wish I were like that Person'.<a name=314:3></a> God keeps that Person before your soul; then you come to the conclusion that your intelligent service is to give God control of the vessel, which in the past you have controlled yourself.<a name=314:4></a> What is the result?<a name=314:5></a> I shall show you.<a name=314:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Saul (Paul) is presented in Scripture as breathing out threatenings and slaughter; how did this come out?<a name=314:7></a> Through his body, his actions; he went to the high priest and received authority to bring bound to Jerusalem any who were of "the way;" he used his body with this in his mind.<a name=314:8></a> Now, that man was captured by God on the high road to Damascus, and the effect was that afterward he breathed out the Spirit of Christ.<a name=314:9></a> The very same body became the vessel that went through shipwreck, journeyings, perils of waters, and what came out of it?<a name=314:10></a> - the Spirit of Christ.<a name=314:11></a> I do not know anything more touching than to see that man in prison, and the jailor, who put him there, saying: "Sirs, what must I do that I may be saved?<a name=314:12></a>" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#16:30">Acts  16:30</a>).<a name=314:13></a> Paul immediately uses his body as a vessel

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, how can you reasonably form an intelligent part of the assembly if you have not submitted your body.<a name=315:2></a> The truth is you have no right to it now.<a name=315:3></a> You are called to glorify God in your body, which is His.<a name=315:4></a> "Preserve me, O God: for I trust in thee", is the Spirit of Christ.<a name=315:5></a> I used to take care of my body and take it to all sorts of places, and things, but when I gave it to God, I let Him take it.<a name=315:6></a> Do you not think God can take very good care of the body?<a name=315:7></a> I remember the remark of a dear brother, now gone to be with the Lord; 'the best remedy for a suffering body is a pious soul'.<a name=315:8></a> "The fear of the Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#111:10">Psalm  111:10</a>).<a name=315:9></a>

		The first thing to do, in order to become an intelligent part of the assembly, is to give over the vessel in which you live to the God to whom it belongs, so that He may get control of it.<a name=315:10></a> When He does, He immediately begins to give you an enlarged conception of Christ.<a name=315:11></a> I recall that wonderful scene recorded in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#24">Exodus  24</a>, after the children of Israel were brought out of Egypt, when Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel went up unto the Lord and they saw the God of Israel, and they did eat and drink; then Moses received divine communications, the

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the epistle to the Colossians is presented to a company of people whose bodies had been captured for God, and the point before the apostle in writing to them is that their minds might be governed by what God has before Himself.<a name=316:2></a> The apostle had a marvellous conception of Christ.<a name=316:3></a> What is your conception of Christ?<a name=316:4></a> Christ is going to bring to pass a condition of things in which people are reconciled - are a positive pleasure and delight to the heart of God.<a name=316:5></a> Christ is going to bring that to pass, and He is bringing it to pass in the minds of believers now, by setting their minds on things above, where there are "pleasures for evermore", and "where the Christ is, sitting" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3:1">Colossians  3:1</a>).<a name=316:6></a>

		I desire, dear friends, to suggest a few simple thoughts in relation to Zion.<a name=323:1></a> The psalm that I read discloses an object on earth of supreme interest to heaven, but it also brings to light a people so affected by divine mercy - I refer to the sons of Korah - that they can review and celebrate the mighty operations of God, by which He has established His metropolis, so to speak, in Zion.<a name=323:2></a> I know dispensationally it presents a millennial view of things, but one would suggest a moral application of the psalm, and one cannot trace the moral operations of God by which He has established Zion, without finding in them an occasion of constant praise to Himself.<a name=323:3></a> One would connect praise individually with His mercy to us in the tents of Jacob, His mercy in relation to the exercises of our individual path, but the word tells us praise waits for God in Zion.<a name=323:4></a> Happy for us when we are there to voice that praise.<a name=323:5></a> The sons of Korah being introduced (see heading) suggests that, however dark the day, hearts will be found in sympathy with God over His supreme interest on earth.<a name=323:6></a>

		The door in this way is left open to persons who have, like the sons of Korah, lost claim to everything but judgment; the door is left open to such to come in on the line of mercy.<a name=324:1></a> It is noticeable that their number is not given, as if to indicate that the number might be as limitless as the mercy that has reached them.<a name=324:2></a> God's thought is to meet all the rebellion against Him by producing hearts that are true to Him, working in His grace in one and another, who not only praise Him for mercy, which has reached them, but who can delight in those marvellous operations of divine power which have established here on earth a vessel for the pleasure and glory of God, even the assembly.<a name=324:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The psalmist dwells on Zion's gates; the gates speak of rule, influence and administration, the continuation of the spirit of that lowly One, even Christ (He who was the true and perfect expression of all a child of Zion should be), the only spirit in which divine administration can be carried out here.<a name=324:4></a> It is not a question, merely of what we do, but it says God loves the <i>gates</i> of Zion; He loves the way things are done, and done by the children of Zion, for the gates of Zion suggest what has to be carried out here on behalf of Christ in His absence.<a name=324:5></a> It is wonderfully blessed to dwell in Jacob's tents, but the mercy that has waited upon us in Jacob's tents is intended to set us free for the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How the experience acquired in Jacob's tents will yield fruit in Zion's administration; every wilderness exercise should contribute to the wealth of the assembly.<a name=325:4></a> It is in all we pass through individually that we learn how God orders things in His house.<a name=325:5></a> He has been perfectly served by His Son, and He will never take less than a son's service in His house; all is to be carried out there in the intelligence and knowledge of God.<a name=325:6></a> What a blessed character the sense of this gives to the simplest detail in the house of God!<a name=325:7></a> It is often easy to see what should be done, but nothing is more testing than to know how to do it.<a name=325:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But not merely do we have the experiences in the tents of Jacob to beget an appreciation of Zion, but there is the place ministry has.<a name=325:9></a> "Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God".<a name=325:10></a> It is the city of light, and every bit of ministry that is of God is intended to move us; indeed, we can measure its effect upon us by the movements of soul it produces with us.<a name=325:11></a> Does it find us nearer to Zion, more free

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Many of us would have closed the psalm at verse 3, but he goes on; for, however beautiful the ministry, things are not, and never do remain, merely a picture to the devoted heart.<a name=326:3></a> Devotion can never be satisfied with admiration.<a name=326:4></a> A devoted heart must live with the object of its devotion in appreciation and appropriation; and so he goes on, "I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon among them that know me".<a name=326:5></a> He has come now to cherish Zion as a divine ideal and everything else - the vast world system in the variety of its subtle features by which Satan would rob us of Christ, and of Zion as an object of interest - is coming under review for displacement in his soul, in the light of Zion.<a name=326:6></a> These cities do not mention him, he could never be written up in Zion if they did, but he makes mention of them.<a name=326:7></a> And that not by the names they give themselves; Rahab is the name for Egypt, as under divine scrutiny.<a name=326:8></a> We have no divine outlook from a tent, we prove mercy there; but we must, in soul, be identified with Christ's supreme interest on earth if we are to have the divine measure of all that

		One loves to think of such an one as Paul under the constraining influence of the love of Christ.<a name=327:2></a> What a reckoning he had of every man in this scene, from whatever city he might come.<a name=327:3></a> He says, "Having judged this: that one died for all, then all have died; and he died for all, that they who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who died for them and has been raised.<a name=327:4></a> So that <i>we</i> henceforth know no one according to flesh" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:14">2 Corinthians  5:14</a> - 16).<a name=327:5></a> That is the life of a true Zionist; he is going to breathe the air of his native city, the city that gave him birth; he is going to live to the One who died for him and rose again.<a name=327:6></a> He passes by the cities in the light of the cross of Christ.<a name=327:7></a>

		It would almost appear as if they would seek to lay claim to the pilgrims to Zion, as Satan magnifies those various features of his system.<a name=327:8></a> There is Egypt, the world of natural resource, but the child of Zion cannot live in Egypt; he can only live in that city which owes its constitution to divine mercy.<a name=327:9></a> One proves divine mercy in that confidence of heart which shuts one up to God, enabling one to refuse the natural resources of this world; for that is the thought of Egypt, its river makes it independent of the rain of heaven.<a name=327:10></a> A citizen of Zion only makes mention of those cities in the light of the death of Christ, as the word says, "Sodom and Egypt, where

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is no family spirit in the places he has enumerated: Egypt, the world of natural resource; Babylon, the Christianised world, heartless to Christ; Philistia, the world of man's mind, intruding into divine things, whose people have assumed possession of divine territory apart from the exercises of the wilderness and the passage of Jordan; Tyre, the business world, the scene of merchant princes, where expansion is the order of the day, but under the authority of the prince of this world; and Ethiopia, the darkness of the natural heart, met, as we know, in the eunuch by the presentation of Jesus.<a name=328:7></a> He has faced them and summed up those principles in himself, judging them in his heart, and now he is free to enjoy the mutuality of Zion.<a name=328:8></a> A little bit of Tyre, how it clouds Zion!<a name=328:9></a> How expansion on this side of death warps our outlook on that marvellous expanse that belongs to resurrection, where the mind and heart are illuminated and enlarged by the Spirit of God, to

		But now the objective is reached, and it is beautiful to mark the spirit of the Zionist here; what impresses him is the family idea, better than his own tent, greater than his own family.<a name=329:3></a> "This one and that one was born in her".<a name=329:4></a> There are men together in the features of Christ, in the mutuality of that love they have learned from Him, that love that cost Him His precious death.<a name=329:5></a> They are all wanted there, wanted for ever in Zion, for none grow old there.<a name=329:6></a> "This one and that one", there are no class distinctions in Zion; all such distinctions belong to Babylon.<a name=329:7></a> It is enough that your neighbour is a Zionist - one of those born in her for you to recognise his claim to all the love of your heart.<a name=329:8></a> 'They do not live in our street', you say.<a name=329:9></a> Ah!<a name=329:10></a> you do not live in Zion if you reason thus, for there is only one street in Zion.<a name=329:11></a>

		You read of it in Revelation, it is of pure gold.<a name=329:12></a> Do you think Zion has many streets today?<a name=329:13></a> We are told it is a city compacted - built together; the inhabitants are <i>very</i> close together, drawn together

		How significant this is, how it suggests that the acceptance of reproach in secret, is the way to divine light; for the vessel to retain the light God gives is formed in the suffering path of reproach.<a name=332:5></a> It often surprises us that so much light should come our way and that so little should be retained by us, but the vessel that retains divine light is not made in a day.<a name=332:6></a> It is in the acceptance of a path of reproach that a way is opened up to Jordan, the place of divine operations, and Jordan is not far from Galilee.<a name=332:7></a> The place of divine reproach is morally very near to the scene of divine power and operations.<a name=332:8></a> As objects of reproach among men, how simple to be the subjects of divine operations.<a name=332:9></a>

		I turned to this passage, dear brethren; it is one of several to which I hope to refer, and I may as well give you the origin of my exercise.<a name=355:1></a> I was feeling exercised, before I came here, as to the final effect of all God's dealings.<a name=355:2></a> All that He has passed us through, and is passing us through, is for <i>His glory</i>; not merely for our relief and help.<a name=355:3></a> Until we are really able to turn to Him in this way, as the result of all our exercises, and the revelation and light God has been pleased to give us, we have hardly got to the end God has in view.<a name=355:4></a> Let me remind you that this passage is the end of a book.<a name=355:5></a> The Psalms are divided into five books, and each book ends with an ascription of praise in one form or another.<a name=355:6></a> I will refer to them in detail to show this.<a name=355:7></a> This passage is the end of the second book, and here we have one of the most complete ascriptions of praise to God.<a name=355:8></a> I shall show the reason directly.<a name=355:9></a>

		The first book ends with <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#41">Psalm  41</a>; in that psalm we see the really godly man, more especially the Lord, betrayed.<a name=355:10></a> He says, "Mine own familiar friend, in whom I confided, who did eat of my

		I could illustrate the same principle from the life of the Lord Jesus.<a name=358:1></a> When He had gone through a great deal in the way of service which had been badly requited, instead of turning away in sulkiness, the perfect Man thanks God: "I praise thee, Father, Lord of the heaven and of the earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11:25">Matthew  11:25</a>).<a name=358:2></a> I could illustrate it with a yet more wonderful passage: "I will declare thy name to my brethren; in the midst of the assembly will I sing thy praises" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:12">Hebrews  2:12</a>).<a name=358:3></a> The blessed Lord passed through all the suffering and forsaking, and now we hear His voice joining in praise in the assembly.<a name=358:4></a> God's end is reached.<a name=358:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to say a word as to the result of individual exercise on the same line.<a name=358:6></a> When Paul speaks of himself and his wonderful conversion, he describes God's grace to himself in <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#1:15">1 Timothy  1:15</a>: "Faithful is the word, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom <i>I</i> am the first".<a name=358:7></a> Then he breaks forth, "Now to the King of the ages, the incorruptible, invisible, only God, honour and glory to the ages of ages.<a name=358:8></a> Amen" (verse 17).<a name=358:9></a> We see how as an individual he had experienced God's wonderful mercy and he returns glory to God for it.<a name=358:10></a> God's end had been reached in that way, because he ascribes glory to the blessed God who came out to him in grace.<a name=358:11></a>

		The whole atmosphere of Christianity is one of praise, adoration and thanks to God.<a name=359:1></a> It would be impossible to go over all the passages in the New Testament which show this.<a name=359:2></a> Christianity is that which brings real joy into our hearts.<a name=359:3></a> Righteousness, peace and <i>joy</i> are the very elements of the kingdom.<a name=359:4></a> God's object is that there should be an intelligent response in His creatures.<a name=359:5></a> The end of Christianity and God's ways is reached when the whole universe responds to what He is as revealed.<a name=359:6></a> In the world to come we find two great results described.<a name=359:7></a> The one is that the knowledge of the Lord covers the earth: that is, light has come out from God and God is <i>known</i>.<a name=359:8></a> The other is that the glory of the Lord will fill the earth - there will be intelligent response in praise to His glory.<a name=359:9></a> We find this wonderful response ringing all through the New Testament.<a name=359:10></a> Take the epistle to the Romans; when Paul is declaring all God's wonderful ways in reconciling the promises to the fathers with grace to the Gentiles, he breaks out in praise as to what God has been doing: "O depth of riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!<a name=359:11></a> how unsearchable his judgments, and untraceable his ways!<a name=359:12></a> .<a name=359:13></a>.<a name=359:14></a>.<a name=359:15></a> For of him, and through him, and for him are all things: to him be glory for ever.<a name=359:16></a> Amen" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#11:33">Romans  11:33</a> - 36).<a name=359:17></a> Paul there had real appreciation of what God had done, not merely that he knew it, but it had so affected his heart that he was able to respond intelligently to God.<a name=359:18></a> So far as Paul was concerned

		God's end was reached.<a name=360:1></a> Paul was well educated to fill the position of the heavenly elder.<a name=360:2></a> Here was one of the ways in which he was being trained (as we all are), so that there should be the consequent outflow of praise to God.<a name=360:3></a> In the same book he also ascribes glory to God when he takes a view of the mystery and surveys the vast field; there is what is beyond that which he has unfolded before in this epistle, and he gives glory to God in view of it.<a name=360:4></a> "The only wise God, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever.<a name=360:5></a> Amen" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#16:27">Romans  16:27</a>).<a name=360:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Following this subject further, we find Paul very appreciative of all that God is doing in regard to His work in the world.<a name=360:7></a> I refer to the fact that he begins many of his epistles by giving thanks to God for all that he finds commendable in the saints.<a name=360:8></a> There are few more wonderful things than God's work in the saints.<a name=360:9></a> He is able to take up and form a man, so that instead of trying to show off himself in pride and conceit, he is living here in a humble way for God's glory.<a name=360:10></a> It is well for us to consider and give thanks to God for His work in the saints.<a name=360:11></a> It is a happy thing to take account of God's work in the saints.<a name=360:12></a> In 1 Corinthians even, he could begin by giving thanks; he saw that which was good, though he corrected the bad - that needs a friendly eye.<a name=360:13></a> In the case of the Galatians; things were so serious that he could not give thanks to God for them then.<a name=360:14></a> He gives thanks to God frequently for the Thessalonians in view of the reality of God's work

		The apostle makes a similar remark in regard to an individual and a company.<a name=361:3></a> Of the Philippians he said, "I thank my God for my whole remembrance of you" (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#1:3">Philippians  1:3</a>); he was filled with joy in that they were going on well.<a name=361:4></a> Paul exemplified this spirit of joy in himself.<a name=361:5></a> At the beginning of his work, in Philippi, he sang praises in the prison, and now his heart can still rejoice.<a name=361:6></a> He makes a similar remark as to Timothy: "I am thankful to God .<a name=361:7></a>.<a name=361:8></a>.<a name=361:9></a> how unceasingly I have the remembrance of thee" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1:3">2 Timothy  1:3</a>).<a name=361:10></a> It was a striking thing to be able to say of any one that every remembrance of him was so happy that it gave occasion of thankfulness to God.<a name=361:11></a> There were no regrets.<a name=361:12></a> Paul is wonderfully in keeping with God's thoughts of His people.<a name=361:13></a>

		Passing to the collective side, Paul also assumes the same blessed attitude, in that he blesses God for what he is about to write to the Colossians.<a name=361:14></a> "Giving thanks to the Father, who has made us fit for sharing the portion of the saints in light" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:12">Colossians  1:12</a>).<a name=361:15></a> He associated himself with the Colossians, showing that the truth had come in power to his own soul.<a name=361:16></a> So in Ephesians, in the well-known passage, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:3">Ephesians  1:3</a>),

		There are a great many other instances - I could refer to Peter's first epistle - but I would like to conclude by referring to what is often called 'the book of judgment', but which is really a book full of ascriptions of praise, that is the Revelation.<a name=362:8></a> If we read the book carefully we find thirteen or fourteen passages in it which call for, or directly ascribe, praise to God.<a name=362:9></a> God's purpose is reached in the different companies in what He is doing, or has done, or will do.<a name=362:10></a> The most intelligent company is the heavenly company, who are qualified by exercises they have passed through down here, fully coming up to God's thought for them.<a name=362:11></a> To guard this, I should say that you do not get exactly in words a worship song in the present dispensation - we worship now in "spirit and in truth;" you do not get a sample of the expression of worship of sons - we should be quite likely to make a wrong use of it if it were put in Scripture.<a name=362:12></a> The power for worship is

		In <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#4">Revelation  4</a>and 5 we find various circles and a series of companies, from the elders down, so educated by what God has passed them through, or taught them, that they are praising Him; it is like <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#148">Psalm  148</a>"Praise ye him .<a name=363:3></a>.<a name=363:4></a>.<a name=363:5></a> Fire and hail, snow .<a name=363:6></a>.<a name=363:7></a>.<a name=363:8></a> Mountains .<a name=363:9></a>.<a name=363:10></a>.<a name=363:11></a> Beasts .<a name=363:12></a>.<a name=363:13></a>.<a name=363:14></a> Kings of the earth and all peoples, .<a name=363:15></a>.<a name=363:16></a>.<a name=363:17></a> young men and maidens; old men with youths, - Let them praise the name of Jehovah: for his name alone is exalted; his majesty is above the earth and the heavens" (verses 2 - 13).<a name=363:18></a> All are called upon to praise the Lord.<a name=363:19></a> It is an ascription of praise and corresponds to <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#4">Revelation  4</a>and 5.<a name=363:20></a> As you pass the varied companies in review, those who pass through tribulation and overcome the beast yield praise to God (see <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#7">Revelation  7</a>and 14); the elders often acting as a chorus.<a name=363:21></a> They have gone through much, and have come to the end of God's ways with them and have understood them, and they praise God.<a name=363:22></a>

		It may be remarked that there are three thoughts that precede these blessings.<a name=370:2></a> "Jehovah came from Sinai, And rose up from Seir unto them; He shone forth from mount Paran" (verse 2), and one would suggest that these divine movements might be compared to three great landmarks in the operations of God in our souls.<a name=370:3></a> Sinai here is given a spiritual application.<a name=370:4></a> This serves to illustrate the spiritual character of Deuteronomy.<a name=370:5></a> Sinai here is not the ministry of death as in Exodus, but rather viewed typically in relation to divine movement.<a name=370:6></a> If we look for a moment at the ten commandments, by way of spiritual analogy, in the way Deuteronomy presents them, we shall see how this works out.<a name=370:7></a> "To us there is one God, the Father" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#8:6">1 Corinthians  8:6</a>).<a name=370:8></a> So every graven image is to be refused, for Christ as the image of God must fill our vision.<a name=370:9></a> Then in the third commandment God's name is not to be taken in vain, but rather to be cherished.<a name=370:10></a> And the Spirit is the power by which we in holy affection can cherish all that comes under the cover of that name here, preserving the blessedness of that name in our hearts.<a name=370:11></a> Then in the fourth commandment the sabbath is introduced.<a name=370:12></a> If we answer to the light of the revelation, if God the Father has His place in our hearts, if Christ engages us as the One who has brought that revelation near to us, and if the Spirit

	<div class="paragraph">
		I desire to lay certain thoughts before you with regard to the Lord Jesus in the wilderness.<a name=387:1></a> You will note that Luke presents the incident in this way - "Jesus .<a name=387:2></a>.<a name=387:3></a>.<a name=387:4></a> returned from the Jordan".<a name=387:5></a> You will remember that when Mark speaks of it he says that "The Spirit drives him out into the wilderness" (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#1:12">Mark  1:12</a>); whereas when Matthew refers to the matter he tells us that He "was carried up into the wilderness" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#4:1">Matthew  4:1</a>).<a name=387:6></a> No doubt all three of these things were true, but the view which Luke gives is that He returned.<a name=387:7></a> It suggests the grace of the Person that was there; there was perfect acquiescence in the will of God.<a name=387:8></a> It was His own movement, no doubt, suggesting that He was in the secret of the will of God as to the path in which He should walk; hence He "returned from the Jordan, and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness".<a name=387:9></a> I would refer to that, and ask whether we have considered the Lord's movements in that way.<a name=387:10></a> The wilderness, for us, is part of the ways of God; and the exercise would be that we return.<a name=387:11></a> We may have passed the Jordan, but there is the return to the wilderness.<a name=387:12></a> The circumstances of our lives here are part of the design of God for us, and one would desire that

		Luke also says that He "was led by the Spirit in the wilderness", not into the wilderness.<a name=388:2></a> Think of the grace of that blessed One here, as waiting upon the Spirit!<a name=388:3></a> Such was the grace of Christ, such was the perfection and glory of the Man upon whom the eye of God could rest with delight.<a name=388:4></a> As there, He was tested, fasting forty days and forty nights, and He hungered.<a name=388:5></a> There was no outward or visible sign of the presence of God; indeed, what was outward and visible would rather suggest that for the moment He was left.<a name=388:6></a> So it is with the saints now; their path may be one of trial and difficulty, even down to extremity; but with Jesus in the utmost extremity, there was unfailing quietness of heart; never was there a breath of mistrust in His blessed heart Godward, although in such circumstances.<a name=388:7></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Satan's lie is used as an attack upon us; he presents all the power and glory of this world in order that we might come under his influence as the god of this world.<a name=391:6></a> We were speaking this afternoon of the literature, science and arts of this world; Satan is endeavouring, and he has long endeavoured, to impose the influence of these things upon the saints, so that they may be dazzled by what he has got.<a name=391:7></a> Christ was found in the path of complete and absolute subjection to the will of God in this world.<a name=391:8></a> I suppose the temptation was peculiarly subtle, because the kingdoms of the world and their glory will yet be His, but He will take them up as the One who has died.<a name=391:9></a>

		The reply of the Lord to this part of the temptations is remarkable.<a name=393:4></a> You will note that His words were, "It is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God".<a name=393:5></a> As if He would indicate to the enemy that He had a word from God of which Satan knew nothing; it was not a written word which could be read, but a spoken word which would be heard in the ear.<a name=393:6></a> Jesus had a place so near that He had heard a word which would regulate Him at that moment.<a name=393:7></a> Precious favour!<a name=393:8></a> For us it is the same, for while the written word is to us the law and the testimony, yet there are times when a special application of it forms a word which is spoken and which we hear.<a name=393:9></a>

		I thought I might venture to pursue a little further this evening the consideration of the subject that has already been before us so encouragingly of the Lord.<a name=437:1></a> One desires that we may have help of the Lord to regard what may be presented from the point of view of its application to each one who is a lover of Christ.<a name=437:2></a> It would, I think, be a comforting impression for every heart, especially those who are younger, to realise that the foundation and spring of all service and attachment to the precious interests of God is affection for Christ.<a name=437:3></a> Apart from our being lovers of Christ there would be no reason for God committing anything to us in regard to His interests.<a name=437:4></a> I am reminded at this juncture of a very sweet word from our Lord when dealing with his disciples here; you will find it in <a href="../bible/John.htm#16:27">John  16:27</a>.<a name=437:5></a> He calls their attention to the fact that the Father's love to them was because of their love for Himself: "The Father himself has affection for you, because ye have had affection for me".<a name=437:6></a> It is not there the sovereign love of the Father finding its reasons only in its own satisfaction, and in the preciousness and glory of the Person of the Son; it is rather that aspect of the love of the Father that finds its motive, as it were,

		in the fact that the disciples were attached to Christ; and out of that love to the Lord there arose all the sweet commitments in regard of divine interest and service.<a name=438:1></a> I would connect with it also the fact that the Lord, when about to leave them, personally breathed into them, saying, "Receive the Holy Spirit" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#20:22">John  20:22</a>).<a name=438:2></a> Not only do we see in that an indication of the necessity of the gift of the indwelling Spirit, but we see it coupled, in the action of the Lord Himself, with those wonderful sensibilities and feelings in regard of divine service that were found present with Him as the Sent One.<a name=438:3></a> The breathing into them of Holy Spirit was the communication of those sensibilities to them.<a name=438:4></a> Doubtless these same sensibilities are connected with the divine nature, as may be seen from John's epistles; and as set forth in the Person of Christ we see them moving along the line of devotedness in regard of the will of God.<a name=438:5></a> So in breathing into them, as He did, you see not only His own act as the last Adam, a quickening Spirit, in its authority, but in the quality of His act you see involved the sensibilities of His own love, as the One who was here for the will of the Father.<a name=438:6></a> I would enlarge on this, as the Lord may help me, and I trust it may appeal to all our hearts, especially to the hearts of the young.<a name=438:7></a>

		sweetly in the Person of the One who laid down His life that we might be secured for the pleasure of the blessed God.<a name=439:1></a> I wish to speak in all simplicity on the matter, and I have turned your attention to the gospel of Mark because of the feature that shines out so preciously in that gospel - the glory of the Lord Jesus Himself, and His prominence as the great Levite.<a name=439:2></a> Now, if we take the course that the Spirit presents to us, we follow the Lord in affection of heart, as it were, to the holy mountain apart, and we look afresh upon Him as He is there presented to us.<a name=439:3></a> I think you will agree that every instinct of the heart that centres in the Person of the Lord Jesus rises with delight to contemplate Him.<a name=439:4></a> He is the object of the Father's pleasure!<a name=439:5></a> If you ask me where we would get an impression of the holiest, I think I may say that in the three gospels that record the incident we would get it on the mount of transfiguration.<a name=439:6></a> We find on that mount the disclosure of the Father's pleasure, and the shining out of the glory of the Lord Jesus.<a name=439:7></a> We find that every other glory is surpassed there; it is the glory of God.<a name=439:8></a> So it becomes the joy of the heart to contemplate the Lord as He is there presented.<a name=439:9></a>

		Now I wish to make to you this suggestion: it was the Lord who inaugurated the movements that led to this ministry to the disciples.<a name=439:10></a> It was not in answer to an enquiry from them that they beheld this glory; it was His own movement.<a name=439:11></a> There is sovereignty in the Lord's care of His disciples, just

		as there is the apparent sovereignty in His choice of those disciples.<a name=440:1></a> It was in His interest in regard of their preparation for Levitical service that He judged it necessary for them to witness His glory, and the good pleasure of God in Himself.<a name=440:2></a> He took the three disciples to a high mountain by themselves <i>apart</i>, where no disturbing element could come.<a name=440:3></a> There they were removed from the surroundings customary to them in the world of men.<a name=440:4></a>

		I think I may here express the thought, that while in a certain sense service takes its commencement from the side of the congregation, and has God for its object along the line upon which it moves, there is another aspect of that selfsame service which takes its character from the fact that the precious motives are found in the holiest.<a name=440:5></a> It is <i>from the holiest it proceeds</i>.<a name=440:6></a> And in this gospel we see it is so in the Lord Himself.<a name=440:7></a> Now, if that be the character of the Lord's own ministry, how sweet to consider that it is the character of His ministry <i>to, and through</i>, His own.<a name=440:8></a> He would appeal to us graciously in regard of this power in ministry.<a name=440:9></a> He took His disciples to the mount of transfiguration, where, in the peace of the holiest, as it were, the glory that had shone into their souls might be viewed according to God; there they saw His glory; it was but for a brief moment, but surely, as we think of the ministry, the results were imperishable.<a name=440:10></a> They were privileged on that occasion to have blotted out from their vision even what the Lord

		We were reminded this afternoon, and in a way that I think should touch the heart of even the youngest who loves the Lord Jesus, that when anything that is committed to us of God falls in our handling from its proper relation to the Lord, it becomes little better than a religion.<a name=441:3></a> The whitening of the fuller goes on all around us; may God preserve us from it!<a name=441:4></a> At best the fuller depraves the things of God.<a name=441:5></a> The purity that holds divine things in their right setting and value, and in their sweetness and power over the saints, as also in their preciousness for God, is the purity that comes from the holiest.<a name=441:6></a> Where Christ is, we are safe.<a name=441:7></a> If it be a question of the strife of tongues - and that is one of the accompaniments of the present religious position - it is not heard on the mount.<a name=441:8></a> The psalmist, in his exercises, takes account of the need for preservation from such strife; he says: "Thou hidest them in a pavilion from the strife of tongues" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#31:20">Psalm  31:20</a>).<a name=441:9></a>

		God Himself inhabits eternity, and there came a day when, amongst other intelligent beings, Satan appeared in His presence, and God asked him where he had been, where he had come from, then raises a question with him in regard to his operations on the earth as to whether he had taken account of this remarkable man - Job.<a name=456:1></a> I believe Job represents the spiritual history of every man in whom God operates.<a name=456:2></a> He is taken account of by God <i>from the outset</i> as entirely according to Himself.<a name=456:3></a> You might not think that of a saint; you might see a good deal of perversity, a good deal that is very unsuitable, but if you were to ask God about any of His people, you would get a similar answer to the remark He made to Satan about Job.<a name=456:4></a> "Hast thou considered my servant Job?<a name=456:5></a>" He points him out as a man amongst men.<a name=456:6></a> I do not know, beloved, whether we sufficiently realise the fact of the great dignity that belongs to any person who stands related to God.<a name=456:7></a> You may say, I do not know much; it is not a question of what you know, it is not a question of your strength, it is a question of the glorious, blessed God.<a name=456:8></a> Think of having God as your God!<a name=456:9></a> It is one of the greatest privileges that any man in the universe can have, to have God as his God, and Job was in that place in the mind of God.<a name=456:10></a> He asked Satan, "Hast thou considered my servant Job?<a name=456:11></a>" Picture God looking down and speaking of you as His servant.<a name=456:12></a> It reminds Him of a time when Christ was here; it reminds Him of a time when One left

		In this book you come into the presence of three things on which I would like to touch.<a name=458:2></a> One is the associations you have formed in this scene; then spiritual ministry; and finally a personal link with God.<a name=458:3></a> Job's friends came to comfort him - they were the associations he had formed in this scene.<a name=458:4></a> They were remarkable men - Jobs friends.<a name=458:5></a> But I tell you what marks associations in this scene, the best of them (I speak of the best, not of the worst).<a name=458:6></a> They were kindly disposed, well intentioned in their feelings, but they entirely missed the operations of God with the man - that is the point.<a name=458:7></a> You often meet persons who have friendly feelings towards you, well disposed, who come and sit perhaps with you in your trial, and then begin a line of argument about you and your ways, your misdoings and otherwise; and if Satan were having his own way, they would entirely divert you from what God is doing - His intentions in regard of you.<a name=458:8></a> Well, I need not say, there comes a time in the history of these people when they are silenced.<a name=458:9></a> Then you get what I understand is presented in Elihu, spiritual ministry.<a name=458:10></a> You come under the influence of things put in a right way.<a name=458:11></a> God is put in His place, man is put in his place, and things are put in their places.<a name=458:12></a> The effect of spiritual ministry (how intensely blessed it is!<a name=458:13></a>) is that you are prepared for personal ministry, prepared to have to do with God Himself.<a name=458:14></a> I think I

		One would like to enlarge on this; the consideration that God had for Job is so very blessed.<a name=459:2></a> He asks him, in the first place, to stand up like a man.<a name=459:3></a> Job might have said, 'I do not feel like one, I feel like a wreck'.<a name=459:4></a> He asks him to stand up like a man and answer him - take the position that grace would give him.<a name=459:5></a> Then God begins to describe His own greatness to Job.<a name=459:6></a> What a help, beloved, ministry is when God becomes great to you.<a name=459:7></a> How magnificent it is to hear God describe His own greatness to Job, and asking him where he was when some of the mighty acts of creation were being done.<a name=459:8></a> 'Where were you?<a name=459:9></a>' Why, beloved, he was nowhere.<a name=459:10></a> You know the outcome of it is that Job gets an immense sense of God, and a very small sense of himself.<a name=459:11></a> That is "the end of the Lord".<a name=459:12></a> "I abhor myself".<a name=459:13></a> But oh, how he must have magnified God in his heart!<a name=459:14></a> How he must have looked up to God in worshipful affection, with an intense feeling of adoration, and be more than ever fixed in his purpose, that 'He is to be my God'.<a name=459:15></a> That is the portion of every child of God on earth.<a name=459:16></a> You may say, 'Well, but you do not understand my history'.<a name=459:17></a> I do not want to understand your history, I would like to understand the God that is behind your history; and at the end of it you will come out doubled.<a name=459:18></a> Everything that you had before comes out now in a

		Paul kept on giving, and asked nothing but to be allowed to die for those whom he served so devotedly.<a name=495:9></a> It is the same spirit which is seen in Samuel when he says, "Far be it from me that I should sin against Jehovah in ceasing to pray for you" (<a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#12:23">1 Samuel  12:23</a>).<a name=495:10></a> There are the sins of
