		through all John's ministry, in the gospel, and the epistles, and the Revelation.<a name=2:1></a> If we were to consult a concordance, it would be surprising the number of times that the word 'know' and 'knowing' comes into John's ministry.<a name=2:2></a> It is especially important in view of all that is abroad in the public profession, that we should come into the knowledge that John has in mind, and, as quickened in our affections, be affected by that knowledge, and especially in view of the enriching of the service of God.<a name=2:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in the first portion we have read the matter of knowledge is presented negatively, which is very interesting.<a name=2:4></a> John opens his gospel with negative references to knowledge, whereas when we come to chapter 17 it is replete with references to positive features of knowledge as to the men that God has given Christ, out of the world.<a name=2:5></a> He says in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1:10">John  1:10</a>, "He [that is Christ] was in the world, and the world had its being through him, and the world <i>knew him not</i>".<a name=2:6></a> Then in verse 26, "John answered them saying, I baptise with water.<a name=2:7></a> In the midst of you stands, whom ye <i>do not know</i>, he who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to unloose".<a name=2:8></a> Then John says, as to the Lamb of God, "He it is of whom I said, A man comes after me who takes a place before me, because he <i>was</i> before me; and I <i>knew him not</i>; but that he might be manifested to Israel, therefore have I come baptising with water.<a name=2:9></a> And John bore witness, saying, I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove from heaven, and it abode upon him.<a name=2:10></a> And I <i>knew him not</i>; but he who sent me to baptise with water, <i>he</i> said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, he it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit.<a name=2:11></a> And I have seen and

		borne witness that this is the Son of God" (verses 30 - 34).<a name=3:1></a> This is what we should keep before us in this first reading, the negative side, throwing into relief what is in mind on the positive side in our enquiry.<a name=3:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.A.<a name=3:3></a>P.<a name=3:4></a> When he says, "I knew him not", is he referring to His eternal personality?<a name=3:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=3:6></a> There is no doubt he is not alluding to Him on natural lines, for John stood related to the Lord on the natural side.<a name=3:7></a> It seems to refer to something very definite on John's part, when he says, "a man comes after me who takes a place before me, because he <i>was</i> before me; and I knew him not".<a name=3:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The moral side is in mind in the first negative suggestion, the condition of the world morally, the created sphere into which the Lord came, "the world had its being through him, and the world knew him not".<a name=3:9></a> It is the moral side in regard to knowledge.<a name=3:10></a> Then it is the religious side in the second reference, those that came out of Jerusalem -- the priests and Levites who should have known, but John says, "whom ye do not know", which suggests the religious darkness marking that setting.<a name=3:11></a> But when we come to the baptist, it is more an allusion to the exclusion of the natural side in the matter of this knowledge.<a name=3:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		M.G.<a name=3:13></a>W.<a name=3:14></a> Is the acquirement of positive knowledge reached by way of our <i>seeing</i>, which is the result of the work of the Spirit in us in the way of enlightenment?<a name=3:15></a> I was thinking of verse 34.<a name=3:16></a> John says there, "I have seen".<a name=3:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=3:18></a> Yes, new birth in its radical character in us brings about the ability to see things which we did not see before.<a name=3:19></a> Seeing is brought much before us in John's ministry, and it is important that our eyes should be open

		spiritually to see what comes within our range in the movements of divine Persons in this gospel.<a name=4:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.P.<a name=4:2></a>B.<a name=4:3></a> Is one of the first steps in acquiring knowledge the realisation that we are without it?<a name=4:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=4:5></a> Yes, the negative side would throw that into relief -- the great need there is for the true knowledge of God, which John's gospel would bring on to our view, beginning with this Person.<a name=4:6></a> It is important that we should get an impression as to the divine Personality that is before us here in the Son -- the Word as He is referred to.<a name=4:7></a> "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God".<a name=4:8></a> Our affections need to be quickened in relation to the Person of Christ.<a name=4:9></a> John's gospel makes a lot of the Person of Christ.<a name=4:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=4:11></a>E.<a name=4:12></a> Had you something further in your mind in alluding to these three categories: the world, and the religious circle, and what is natural?<a name=4:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=4:14></a> I think John is stressing the negative side as he opens his ministry, to bring into relief what was in the assembly; the realm to which we belong.<a name=4:15></a> The Lord has great pleasure in referring in chapter 17 to what is known in that realm.<a name=4:16></a> He says, "They have <i>known</i> that all things that thou hast given me are of thee" (verse 7); "they … have <i>known</i> truly that I came out from thee" (verse 8); and "these have <i>known</i> that thou hast sent me.<a name=4:17></a> And I have made <i>known</i> to them thy name" (verses 25, 26).<a name=4:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=4:19></a>E.<a name=4:20></a> Is it of any interest that Peter's wife is not referred to in this gospel?<a name=4:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=4:22></a> Say what is in your mind in that regard.<a name=4:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=4:24></a>E.<a name=4:25></a> I was thinking of your allusion to John ruling out the natural element, and I was wondering if the Spirit
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=5>[Page 5]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		keeps us, in the narrative, entirely in relation to what is spiritual.<a name=5:1></a> I suppose most of us have, in our minds, ruled out the element of the world, and of the religious circle, but I wonder whether we sufficiently face this natural element.<a name=5:2></a> I wondered if John is a model to us in that way?<a name=5:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=5:4></a> I think he is.<a name=5:5></a> He would help us to see the importance of coming under the hands of divine Persons, in view of the knowledge that we are speaking about.<a name=5:6></a> It is quite evident that we need divine help when it comes to the matter of the knowledge of divine Persons and divine things.<a name=5:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.J.<a name=5:8></a>G.<a name=5:9></a> In his first epistle he says, "we know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in the wicked one" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:19">1 John  5:19</a>).<a name=5:10></a> Does that fit in with what we have before us here?<a name=5:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=5:12></a> Very good.<a name=5:13></a> That is an interesting passage.<a name=5:14></a> One was thinking of it in relation to this subject, because he immediately continues, as you will recall in the following verse, "And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us an understanding that we should know him that is true; and we are in him that is true, in his Son Jesus Christ.<a name=5:15></a> He is the true God and eternal life".<a name=5:16></a> It bears on what we have here.<a name=5:17></a> John would help us to see what we stand related to, in the environment that we are in -- we know that we are of God.<a name=5:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		E.J.<a name=5:19></a>H.<a name=5:20></a> Would you say that these negatives of John the baptist's are all the more remarkable on account of what we might speak of as the excellency of John the baptist on the natural line?<a name=5:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=5:22></a> Yes, because John was a remarkable personality himself -- a distinguished personality, marked

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		out by an intervention from heaven.<a name=6:1></a> One who was filled with the Holy Spirit.<a name=6:2></a> He was a remarkable man in that way, and yet he says in such a precise, definite way, "I knew him not", showing that there is no pretension on John's part to advance any premium that he might have put on his link with Christ along natural lines.<a name=6:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.W.<a name=6:4></a>G.<a name=6:5></a>T.<a name=6:6></a> I wondered if the fact that the Spirit of God uses two words for 'knowledge' or 'know' would help in the enquiry.<a name=6:7></a> One is conscious knowledge, and the other is objective knowledge?<a name=6:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=6:9></a> Yes, it does help.<a name=6:10></a> There is what we know objectively, and there is what we know consciously.<a name=6:11></a> It is remarkable that in verse 9 he says, "the true light was that which, coming into the world, lightens every man".<a name=6:12></a> It is not that every man has the knowledge.<a name=6:13></a> It is not the idea of enlightenment, as Mr.<a name=6:14></a> Darby points out (see note <i>f</i>); it is light to every man, sheds its light upon every man; that is, the bearing of it is towards all.<a name=6:15></a> But then we know that we need the Spirit in regard of knowledge that we are speaking of -- christian knowledge -- the knowledge of divine Persons and divine things.<a name=6:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.R.<a name=6:17></a>U.<a name=6:18></a>B.<a name=6:19></a> Is the basis of all this, "born of God"?<a name=6:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=6:21></a> Well, we should never know divine things unless we are the subjects of divine operations.<a name=6:22></a> "Born of God" brings on to our view a class of persons here, that are distinctly marked out as having a right -- a right to take a certain place.<a name=6:23></a> In the light of John's epistle it would be a class of persons who know God, because they are begotten of God.<a name=6:24></a>

		<a name=7>[Page 7]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.H.<a name=7:1></a>G.<a name=7:2></a> Is it in your mind that in approaching the knowledge of divine Persons the first essential is the appreciation of Christ, and who He is?<a name=7:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=7:4></a> That is what is particularly in one's mind, and that we should not miss the wonderful Personality that is before us in "the Word;" in this opening section of John's gospel.<a name=7:5></a> The very use of the appellation 'Word', reminds us that the thought of the revelation of God is a prime matter in John's mind.<a name=7:6></a> It is important that we should allow the Spirit of God to have His way in fastening our attention on the glory of this divine Person, of whom John the evangelist, in the Spirit's power, writes.<a name=7:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		F.W.<a name=7:8></a>K.<a name=7:9></a> So would the negative in verse 18, "No one has seen God at any time", be important in that connection?<a name=7:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=7:11></a> Well, it would, because there is what we cannot know -- what we cannot apprehend.<a name=7:12></a> Even in regard to what we are saying as to our subject of the knowledge of divine Persons; we are not seeking in any way to intimate that we can know all that there is to be known of divine Persons, because we cannot, and we do not.<a name=7:13></a> There is what we do not know, and what we do not see, and John would remind us of that to begin with -- that we have limitations.<a name=7:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.M.<a name=7:15></a>P.<a name=7:16></a> When it says, "the natural man .<a name=7:17></a>.<a name=7:18></a>.<a name=7:19></a> cannot know them because they are spiritually discerned" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:14">1 Corinthians  2:14</a>), does it refer to what can be known?<a name=7:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=7:21></a> Yes, the Spirit of God is alluded to as the great instrumentality by whom God is revealing these things to us.<a name=7:22></a> He reveals them to us by His Spirit.<a name=7:23></a> "The Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God" (verse 10).<a name=7:24></a>

		<a name=8>[Page 8]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.H.<a name=8:1></a> Have you in mind that the features you have named, what is moral and religious and natural, are calculated to militate against our apprehension of the presentation of the Person?<a name=8:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=8:3></a> Yes, we have to have a judgment in our souls as to this negative side, if we are to come in for the knowledge par excellence which John has in mind -- the knowledge of divine Persons and divine things.<a name=8:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=8:5></a>E.<a name=8:6></a> Would it be in keeping to ask if there is in the three outstanding titles in these verses an off-set to the three spheres that you refer to?<a name=8:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=8:8></a> You mean "the Word", and "the Christ;" and what other one are you referring to?<a name=8:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=8:10></a>E.<a name=8:11></a> I was thinking of the Word; and the glory of an only-begotten with a father; and then finally the Son of God.<a name=8:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=8:13></a> Yes, it is important that we should see the way in which Christ is presented in this section, first as "the Word".<a name=8:14></a> Then as the Son, the only-begotten Son, and the glory of an only-begotten with a father -- the truth of Christ's sonship, which the religious world does not understand at all.<a name=8:15></a> Then what we have coming in later in regard to "the Christ", and "the Lamb of God", and the "Son of God", and He "who baptises with the Holy Spirit".<a name=8:16></a> All that is important in our apprehension of Christ, over against these environments that are suggested in the negative statements that we have referred to.<a name=8:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.L.<a name=8:18></a>F.<a name=8:19></a> Does it help to see that there are three more negatives that are referred to in verse 13 as to the way that the believer is born?<a name=8:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=9>[Page 9]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=9:1></a> Yes, it does.<a name=9:2></a> "<i>Not</i> of blood, <i>nor</i> of flesh's will, <i>nor</i> of man's will, but of God".<a name=9:3></a> We are reminded thus of the impotence connected with that range of things, so that in coming into the knowledge of God as revealed in this gospel, it is important that we should see how much depends on divine help.<a name=9:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A.W.<a name=9:5></a>G.<a name=9:6></a>T.<a name=9:7></a> I wondered whether that was not really the force of your calling attention to the negatives, that as we accept the negative side, it throws our thoughts and activities in the direction where what is positive can be secured.<a name=9:8></a> Is that what is in your mind?<a name=9:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=9:10></a> That is right, and the negative side can only rightly be understood, and fully apprehended, as the glory of the Person of Christ is apprehended.<a name=9:11></a> That is what helps us to see the negativity of what is in these different realms, or environments.<a name=9:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.S.<a name=9:13></a>S.<a name=9:14></a> Does verse 14 bring before us what we may enter into?<a name=9:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=9:16></a> Well, it is an allusion to Christ's sonship.<a name=9:17></a> John's gospel does not treat of sonship in the saints, he would fasten our gaze spiritually on the uniqueness of Christ's sonship.<a name=9:18></a> But then in relation to what you say, we can see that that is the mind of God for us, because the mind of God for us as to sonship is set out in Christ in sonship in manhood.<a name=9:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		W.S.<a name=9:20></a>S.<a name=9:21></a> Yes.<a name=9:22></a> I was thinking of the contemplation of the glory and the fulness that was there.<a name=9:23></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=9:24></a> Yes, how important that word 'contemplation' is in that regard.<a name=9:25></a> We need to allow our minds and our affections to be given over to this contemplative attitude.<a name=9:26></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=10>[Page 10]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.A.<a name=10:1></a>P.<a name=10:2></a> Would you say something about verse 18 in regard to the relation between sonship and the declaration, "No one has seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, <i>he</i> hath declared him".<a name=10:3></a> His sonship there would of course be of a special character?<a name=10:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=10:5></a> Yes, only a divine Person could be referred to in this way, "the only-begotten Son".<a name=10:6></a> It is important to see that sonship not only hinges, as we have been taught, on Christ's humanity, but also on His eternal personality.<a name=10:7></a> It is an important thing to see that, because it is His eternal personality that gives a unique touch to His sonship.<a name=10:8></a> Only a Person who is divine could be referred to as He is in this section.<a name=10:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=10:10></a>E.<a name=10:11></a> Do we come to the term "the only-begotten Son" by way of "the Word was God".<a name=10:12></a> And "the Word became flesh"?<a name=10:13></a> Is that right?<a name=10:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=10:15></a> Well, you mean the allusion in verse 1 to what He was in the pre-incarnate condition of Deity?<a name=10:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=10:17></a>E.<a name=10:18></a> Yes, as you said, His essential Personality.<a name=10:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=10:20></a> Yes, so that the mediatorial system is involved in what we have in verses 14 and 18 -- the position the Lord has come into; taking a place, as He has, in incarnation, "the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us", and then being "in the bosom of the Father".<a name=10:21></a> The mediatorial economy is thus suggested to us in all its attractiveness to begin with; it comes before us officially in its operations later on.<a name=10:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=10:23></a>E.<a name=10:24></a> I wondered if that is why we have no allusion to the Lord's nativity in this gospel, because there is a certain
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=11>[Page 11]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		way in which we can be affected naturally by that, is there not?<a name=11:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=11:2></a> That is so.<a name=11:3></a> So it is interesting to see the whole bearing of John's gospel as standing outside of dispensation.<a name=11:4></a> It is not what can be limited to dispensation, although what enters into it particularly characterises and affects our dispensation, but it cannot be limited to it, because of the Persons that are referred to in the revelation of God in it.<a name=11:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.H.<a name=11:6></a> Would not what verse 1 gives us indicate what has to be borne in mind in this enquiry, that the One who was the Word -- known here as the Word -- the full expression of the mind of God -- was nevertheless God Himself?<a name=11:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=11:8></a> It is important that we should see this, and verse 1 is very much on one's heart in regard to what we are considering -- the way the appellation "the Word" begins this gospel, "In the beginning was the Word".<a name=11:9></a> It is not that He was the Word then, but John the evangelist, in referring to His position in Deity, uses the appellation "the Word".<a name=11:10></a> Not that He was the Word then, but that He was known in testimony here among the saints in that way.<a name=11:11></a> It seems to suggest at the outset of John's gospel the way the intelligence and affections of the saints were affected by what came within their range in this Person.<a name=11:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		C.H.<a name=11:13></a> And thinking of the three Persons, we can only identify Them by the names They have taken?<a name=11:14></a>

		S.McC.<a name=13:12></a> Yes, but that would not be the fulness of Deity.<a name=13:13></a> We are speaking of how God has come into revelation, how the Deity has come near to us in Christ, in One who has the ability to make God known, to reveal God, as conveyed in the expression "the Word".<a name=13:14></a> When we come to verse 16, the allusion in that section is to the glory of His manhood, and to what is coming out in His position in sonship in manhood.<a name=13:15></a>

		S.McC.<a name=14:12></a> It would.<a name=14:13></a> The presentation of a divine Person is calculated to elicit some feature of homage from our hearts.<a name=14:14></a> How wonderful it is that God should have come within our range in this way, in a Person who is referred to as "the Word", and a Person who is referred to as the "only-begotten Son".<a name=14:15></a> These two features of His glory are intended to help us in regard to our knowledge of God.<a name=14:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		J.S.<a name=16:16></a>E.<a name=16:17></a> So it is right, from the standpoint of this narrative, to view him apart from the place he had in an earlier dispensation, and to take account of him in relation to these high and glorious matters that are coming before us.<a name=16:18></a> He is singled out in this chapter as the only man who ever saw the Spirit, and that cannot be dispensational can it?<a name=16:19></a>

		S.McC.<a name=16:20></a> No, it is not.<a name=16:21></a> He is unique in that way.<a name=16:22></a> John the baptist is unique in many ways, and I think it all bears on the excellence of the spiritual knowledge that John the evangelist has in mind that belongs to those that are under the divine hand.<a name=16:23></a>

		S.McC.<a name=17:5></a> No.<a name=17:6></a> I think "<i>he</i> hath declared" is a formal service here, with a public bearing upon the whole position.<a name=17:7></a> It is not a reference to His public service so much in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1">Hebrews  1</a>, but a reference to what He is, what He was, as Man.<a name=17:8></a> He was the expression of His substance -- it was there in Him as Man.<a name=17:9></a> But here it is a formal service that is in mind.<a name=17:10></a> Now if we could just dwell on the titles "the Word" and "Son" for a moment as bearing on this matter of knowledge that we are considering.<a name=17:11></a> The Word particularly refers to His ability to make the whole mind of God known, not only in One who can be the instrument of that service, speaking in a reverential way, but One who in Himself <i>is</i> God, and therefore can adequately express God and the whole mind of God.<a name=17:12></a> Then the title "the only-begotten Son" is a peculiarly endearing reference to the place that He has in divine affections, stressing the love side.<a name=17:13></a> The Word hardly stresses the love side, it stresses the side of intelligence; but the only-begotten Son stresses the love side.<a name=17:14></a> It is God coming near in His nature -- "God is love", and the economy is devised so that we should know and understand love, and see, that in making Himself known, God is drawing near in relationships intelligible to us, that are calculated to affect our souls.<a name=17:15></a>

		S.McC.<a name=84:7></a> It is very interesting that the Son of man is so much mentioned in the gospels and is mentioned in the Acts, and we have a reference which bears on it in Hebrews, but generally the title is not employed in the epistles.<a name=84:8></a> I think "the Christ" represents, as you say, something on that line, that He is the answer to every human hope.<a name=84:9></a> Whether it be in man generally, or whether it be in Israel, in regard to the whole scope of prophecy; the Christ is the answer to every human hope in the gentile world and in Israel.<a name=84:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		S.McC.<a name=119:1></a> It is felt that these two passages that we have read should complete our enquiry in relation to the subject that has been before us in this gospel, as to the knowledge of divine Persons and divine things.<a name=119:2></a> The verses in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>were read because they are involved in what the Lord says in chapter 17: 26, "And I have made known to them thy name, and will make it known".<a name=119:3></a> There are one or two references to the thought of the knowledge of divine Persons in this wonderful chapter, and it has been referred to as the greatest chapter in the apostolic section of the Scriptures.<a name=119:4></a> It is a chapter that is different from all the others.<a name=119:5></a> A certain uniqueness attaches to it, in that we are not exactly in the presence of ministry in this chapter, but in the presence of the speaking of one divine Person to Another.<a name=119:6></a> We are not in the presence exactly of the Lord teaching in ministry in this chapter, but we are privileged to be, as it were, in the presence of His speaking to the Father -- one divine Person speaking to Another.<a name=119:7></a> On the one hand it is in the light of His own equality with the Father, on the other as in the subject dependent place out of which He never took Himself, as having come into it.<a name=119:8></a> Even in this chapter, while His equality is asserted, He takes the place of receiving things from the Father.<a name=119:9></a> It is thought that we should see first what is referred to in "And

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=120:13></a> The Son is speaking to the Father.<a name=120:14></a> We are in a priestly realm, our minds are impregnated through His utterances with the thought of holiness as He recognises what the Father has given to Him out of the world, and expresses His holy desire that they should be kept from the evil that is in the world.<a name=120:15></a> The Lord is priestly in His attitude here, and the whole chapter is filled with priestly utterances in so lofty and exalted a subject as the chapter contemplates.<a name=120:16></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=121:2></a> Yes, it is; it is drawn attention to in regard to the position that the Lord has, as given authority over all flesh, which would look on to the millennial world and the millennial day.<a name=121:3></a> But our thoughts are particularly concentrated on the disciples, and on those that should believe on Him through their word, as particularly selected, marked out in relation to this great blessing, this wondrous blessing, though not as great as sonship.<a name=121:4></a> Eternal life is not as great as sonship, but it is a wondrous blessing, one of the greatest blessings that we possess.<a name=121:5></a> We have been blessed with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ, and eternal life is one of them.<a name=121:6></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		T.J.<a name=122:3></a>G.<a name=122:4></a> Does the emphasis being on <i>eternal</i> in that verse suggest that the knowledge of "the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent" is not the acquisition of a mere point of knowledge, but an eternal matter that becomes an integral part of the believer?<a name=122:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		S.McC.<a name=122:6></a> Yes, the word eternal, of course, in "eternal life" should be contrasted with a scene of death, wherein man's life has been shortened.<a name=122:7></a> We know that in the early chapters of Genesis great longevity marked man's life, but that has been shortened, and tremendous difficulties and pressures have come in through sin in relation to the shortening of man's life.<a name=122:8></a> Eternal life is the great answer to that, in the very scene where sin has brought in such disaster.<a name=122:9></a> Eternal life of course is referring to an out-of-the-world condition of things.<a name=122:10></a>

		G.R.<a name=145:1></a>C.<a name=145:2></a> The Psalms are suggested, with the desire that we may be helped in the praises of God.<a name=145:3></a> It is proposed to take up a book in each of the five readings, considering the salient features of each, particularly having in mind the doxology at the end of each book.<a name=145:4></a> We are not thinking of the Psalms as applied to Israel, but rather seeking the Spirit's help in giving an application to them, as bearing on the praises of the assembly.<a name=145:5></a> I think all would agree that this is justifiable, because the assembly was the primary thought with God: and while scriptures such as the Psalms have a special bearing upon Israel, the Spirit of God ever had the assembly before Him when inditing Scripture.<a name=145:6></a> The whole of Scripture, thus, was written for our learning.<a name=145:7></a> We can read the Psalms, therefore, in the light of Paul's ministry and the place the assembly has in association with, and as united to, Christ.<a name=145:8></a> As read in that way, they are calculated, one feels, to expand our thoughts as to the praises of God.<a name=145:9></a> It has been noted by others that the Psalms begin with the blessedness of the man, that is man according to God, and bring out the blessedness of God, ending with the last five Psalms which constitute the great Hallel (i.<a name=145:10></a>e.<a name=145:11></a> praise) to God.<a name=145:12></a> The last Psalm is an ascription of praise to God in the greatness of His Being, as signified in the names of Jah and El, so that the Psalms, especially

		as viewed in christian light, lead up to a remarkable climax.<a name=146:1></a> God, as God, is praised in the greatness of His Being, by creatures who have become intelligent as to His nature and attributes, by the way in which He has come out in declaration and revelation.<a name=146:2></a> Such can render to Him a worthy note of praise.<a name=146:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I think the first book of Psalms particularly has in mind the purpose of God, and presents God to us in relation to His purpose.<a name=146:4></a> The purpose of God takes our minds back to a past eternity, and in its fulfilment leads our minds on to the eternity to come, and so we can understand the doxology at the end, "Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, from eternity to eternity!<a name=146:5></a> Amen, and Amen" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#41:13">Psalm  41:13</a>).<a name=146:6></a> But then, with that in mind, the book dwells much on Christ as the Man of God's purpose.<a name=146:7></a> When it speaks of His moral features, it often indicates that there will be others like Him.<a name=146:8></a> The first psalm, while applying primarily to Christ, has a more general application, for it refers to the assembly of the righteous.<a name=146:9></a> Similarly, the first part of <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#24">Psalm  24</a>says, "Who shall ascend into the mount of Jehovah?<a name=146:10></a> and who shall stand in his holy place?<a name=146:11></a>" And goes on to say, "This is the generation of them that seek unto him".<a name=146:12></a> So that where there are moral descriptions, while Christ is primarily in mind, it makes way for the generation of Jesus Christ.<a name=146:13></a> But when you come to the glories of the Christ in this book, they are unique to Him -- no one can share them with Him.<a name=146:14></a> The second psalm brings out basic glories upon which the whole divine plan, as one might say, rests.<a name=146:15></a> He is God's anointed -- God's Christ; He is God's Son, and He is also called the Son.<a name=146:16></a> It is a remarkable thing that at the opening

		G.R.<a name=188:17></a>C.<a name=188:18></a> I would like to make another suggestion in connection with this psalm.<a name=188:19></a> The word translated Lord is Adonai.<a name=188:20></a> 'The Adonai gives the word' (verse 11), and, 'The Adonai is among them' (verse 17).<a name=188:21></a> He is the One who has ascended on high, and He is operating for the dwelling of Jah Elohim.<a name=188:22></a> It says, 'Blessed be the Adonai' (verse 19), and in verse 22, 'the Adonai said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring them again from the depth of the sea', and then in verse 32, 'Ye kingdoms of the earth, sing unto God; sing psalms of the Adonai'.<a name=188:23></a> It seems to be a title that attaches in a remarkable way to Christ.<a name=188:24></a> Of course, He is also Jehovah of hosts, as in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#24">Psalm  24</a>, but in this psalm He is referred to as Adonai, as also in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#110:5">Psalm  110:5</a>, 'the Adonai at thy right hand'.<a name=188:25></a> I am wondering whether we have limited too much the idea of lordship in Christ to what He is as made Lord.<a name=188:26></a> My impression is that lordship in Christ, as seen in Ephesians, runs into the truth of His Person.<a name=188:27></a> It is true that "God has made him, this Jesus .<a name=188:28></a>.<a name=188:29></a>.<a name=188:30></a>

		Each passage we have read refers to God dwelling.<a name=263:1></a> According to the first passage He dwells in unapproachable light; it says of Him, "who only has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light; whom no man has seen, nor is able to see; to whom be honour and eternal might.<a name=263:2></a> Amen".<a name=263:3></a> Paul's heart is moved in worship to the God who dwells, in the self-sufficiency and greatness of His essential Being, in unapproachable light, entirely beyond the vision of the creature.<a name=263:4></a> It is remarkable that a worshipper should give expression to this, and I suppose only a worshipper could do so.<a name=263:5></a> Paul himself is the outstanding example of a worshipper in the New Testament.<a name=263:6></a> As he touches one truth after another, even while writing the epistles, he breaks out in worship, showing what a constitutional worshipper he was.<a name=263:7></a> In Romans he has only to mention God as Creator, "the incorruptible God", as he calls Him, when his heart is moved to worship, and he says, "who is blessed for ever.<a name=263:8></a> Amen" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#1:23">Romans  1:23</a>, 25).<a name=263:9></a> And so later in that epistle, as he touches one important truth after another, he gives expression to a doxology.<a name=263:10></a> It is such a man as that who gives us this statement as to God, "dwelling in unapproachable light; whom no man has seen, nor is able to see".<a name=263:11></a> How did Paul know about this?<a name=263:12></a> It does not say

		here that God is dwelling in thick darkness.<a name=264:1></a> That was so in Old Testament times, as far as <i>men</i> were concerned; but God in His absoluteness dwells in <i>light</i>, although it is unapproachable.<a name=264:2></a> It magnifies God in our minds and thoughts, to know that He dwells in light, although it is entirely beyond us.<a name=264:3></a> What a marvellous thing it is that the God who dwells there, and ever will dwell there, should move out from that seclusion where no one has seen, nor could see, Him!<a name=264:4></a> He is there in His own self-sufficiency and self-existence.<a name=264:5></a> Why should He move out from that seclusion, where He is beyond the knowledge of the creature in every way?<a name=264:6></a> I believe the answer lies in what has been revealed as to the nature of God, that God is love, and that He desired to be known and to be loved responsively by intelligent creatures.<a name=264:7></a> Indeed, He desired to dwell among such -- that is marvellous -- and the creature upon whom His heart was set, according to eternal purpose, was man.<a name=264:8></a> We do not read that God ever dwelt, or will dwell, with angels.<a name=264:9></a> He dwells in unapproachable light, but when it speaks of His dwelling in other ways, as in the scriptures we have read, it speaks of Him dwelling with men.<a name=264:10></a> It is a marvellous thing that God has come out from the seclusion, where He dwells in His own self-sufficiency, having in mind to dwell with men, because man is an order of being capable of taking in, and responding intelligently to, the disclosures of Himself that He had in mind to make; responding affectionately and in praise.<a name=264:11></a> And so, from the outset of God's creational activities, wisdom's delights were with the sons of men.<a name=264:12></a>

		To proceed to our second scripture, Isaiah says, "For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, and whose name is Holy: I dwell in the high and holy place, and with him that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones".<a name=266:5></a> What a touching passage this is!<a name=266:6></a> God could speak in this way because Christ was coming in.<a name=266:7></a> If He could dwell in past dispensations with those who were of a contrite and humble spirit, it was because Christ was to come and accomplish the work of redemption.<a name=266:8></a> Their faith looked on to Christ.<a name=266:9></a> From Abel onwards -- indeed, from Adam onwards, faith ever looked on to Christ.<a name=266:10></a> God was going to set Him forth a mercy-seat.<a name=266:11></a> He could never be the Centre of the vast creation, sin having come in, unless He was a mercy-seat.<a name=266:12></a> God has now set forth Christ Jesus a mercy-seat, through faith in His blood, and the value of His work has its effect backwards, as well as forwards.<a name=266:13></a> As it says in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#3:25">Romans  3:25</a>, 26, "For the shewing forth of his righteousness, in respect of the passing by the sins that had taken place before, through the forbearance of God; for the shewing forth of his righteousness in the present time, so that he should be just, and justify him that is of the faith of Jesus".<a name=266:14></a> It is a wonderful thing that, although God had in mind to dwell with men, the fulfilment of it awaited redemption.<a name=266:15></a> There is no suggestion

		All this is to be in our minds as to the present time, as to where Jesus is, glorified along with the Father with the glory which He had along with Him before the world was; having also glory given to Him as Man which He shares with us, and having also glory given to Him which we are to behold but cannot share.<a name=279:2></a> Many glories are, I think, included in the expression "my glory" (verse 24).<a name=279:3></a> I believe it includes His glory as the Centre of the divine system.<a name=279:4></a> He is the Image of the invisible God; the Mediator of God and men; the effulgence of God's glory and the expression of His substance; and the One in whom all the fulness of the Godhead dwells bodily.<a name=279:5></a> These are glories which we behold, but which none can share; they relate to what He is from God towards man.<a name=279:6></a> What a glorious Person He is!<a name=279:7></a> Then on the return side, on the line of the response from man Godward, He is Minister of the holy places.<a name=279:8></a> No one can share that glory.<a name=279:9></a> But how wonderful to be with Him where He is and thus, in the greatest nearness, to behold His glory -- so varied!<a name=279:10></a> How wonderful, too, that the assembly should so derive from Him as to be His fulness, "the fulness of him who fills all in all" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:23">Ephesians  1:23</a>).<a name=279:11></a> You say, it means that the assembly is the fulness of a Man.<a name=279:12></a> It does, indeed; nevertheless no one less than God can fill all in all.<a name=279:13></a> That Man is the One in whom all the fulness of the Godhead dwells bodily.<a name=279:14></a>

		So the Lord asks -- not that our asking can be on the level of His.<a name=280:10></a> The word translated "demand" in this chapter, as the note (<i>a</i>) in chapter 14 indicates, is a familiar request on the part of an equal.<a name=280:11></a> The Lord was speaking thus to His Father.<a name=280:12></a> The word used as to our asking, is the word which we would normally speak of as prayer.<a name=280:13></a> Nevertheless, the Lord is surely giving a lead in asking; and, before making these specific requests as to unity, we get an indication of the Lord's outlook on the saints.<a name=280:14></a> I do not think we can pray on the high level unless we have a right outlook on the saints.<a name=280:15></a> So far as the Lord's words in this chapter are concerned, we would not know that those for whom He was praying had had any sinful history, or sinful origin.<a name=280:16></a> Why could the Lord speak of them, and regard them abstractly, in this way -- as apart from what they were as after the flesh?<a name=280:17></a> The basis for it is set out in verse 4: "I have

		He says, "I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou gavest me out of the world.<a name=281:9></a> They were thine" (verse 6).<a name=281:10></a> That was their origin, they belonged to the Father, and He gave them to the Son.<a name=281:11></a> Later He says, "they are thine" (verse 9).<a name=281:12></a> That is because His work is regarded as completed.<a name=281:13></a> "They were thine" in purpose; "they are thine" because His work is done, redemption is accomplished.<a name=281:14></a> This is the only gospel which mentions the blood and the water.<a name=281:15></a> He says, "they are thine, and all that is mine is thine, and all that is thine mine".<a name=281:16></a> Think of the community of ownership of the Father and the Son -- no separate property!<a name=281:17></a> "All that is mine is thine, and all that is thine mine".<a name=281:18></a> The Father delights to hear the saints spoken of like this, because they belong to Him; they were His and He gave them to the Son, and they <i>are</i> His.<a name=281:19></a> It is with this

		So He goes on to His specific requests, and the first is, "Holy Father, keep them in thy name which thou hast given me, that they may be one as we".<a name=282:9></a> This, of course, especially relates to the twelve.<a name=282:10></a> There were eleven only here; but the number was made up by one who had assembled with them all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out amongst them.<a name=282:11></a> How wonderful these pronouns are -- "one as we", "one in us".<a name=282:12></a> I believe the first relates to <i>unity in the Divine nature</i>, seen in all its perfection in the Father and the Son.<a name=282:13></a> But we have been made partakers of the divine nature, as Peter says; we are born of God.<a name=282:14></a> In chapter 1 the writer speaks of those who have the right to be called children of God -- those who were born of God.<a name=282:15></a> So the word is, "Holy Father, keep them in thy name which thou hast given me".<a name=282:16></a> It is a question of being kept in the name of the Holy Father, so that <i>we are true to our family status</i>.<a name=282:17></a> "See what love the Father has given to us, that we should be called the children of God" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:1">1 John  3:1</a>).<a name=282:18></a> That word 'children' is not diminutive; however much we grow in spiritual stature we are still <i>children of God</i>.<a name=282:19></a> It is a dignified term, and it implies that we <i>partake of the divine nature</i>, and it has in

		As regards the second unity, the Lord says, "I do not demand for these only, but also for those who believe on me through their word; that they may be all one".<a name=284:3></a> The first applies to us by extension, for we all have to take up administrative matters; but this <i>specifically</i> brings us in.<a name=284:4></a> "That they may be all one, as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us".<a name=284:5></a> The basis of this unity lies in the gift of the Spirit.<a name=284:6></a> The three unities run on together, and I do not wish to separate them, but the Lord distinguishes them.<a name=284:7></a> This request has been answered.<a name=284:8></a> Whatever may be the outward state of things, it is still true that there is one body and one Spirit.<a name=284:9></a> Thank God, we have been brought back to the light of the one body, and we are being more and more helped as to the one Spirit, with a view to keeping the unity of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace.<a name=284:10></a> For that purpose we need all lowliness, meekness and long-suffering, forbearing one another in love.<a name=284:11></a> Are these features present in our localities?<a name=284:12></a> Are we using diligence to keep the unity of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace?<a name=284:13></a>
