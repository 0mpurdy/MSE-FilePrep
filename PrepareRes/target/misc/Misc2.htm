		I desire to draw attention to the Lord's own words in the address to Smyrna, when He said, "I know .<a name=1:1></a>.<a name=1:2></a>.<a name=1:3></a> the railing of those who say that they themselves are Jews, and are not, but a synagogue of Satan" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2:9">Revelation  2:9</a>), and to show how the Lord secures now the whole house of Israel in those who know what it is to be Jews in truth.<a name=1:4></a> My object in reading these scriptures is to make clear what it is to be a Jew inwardly, as the apostle speaks.<a name=1:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is often said of the saints, and no doubt it is true, that as to the truth, their eyes are in advance of their feet.<a name=1:6></a> It is a true saying that 'the eyes see farther than the feet go', but the divine intent is that our spiritual understanding should be commensurate with our intelligence.<a name=1:7></a> We have much light as to God's thoughts, but we often lack in being the expression of this light in ourselves, hence our public movements are oftentimes not in accord with the light.<a name=1:8></a> So in discipline the Lord sees fit betimes to restrain our activities in moving outwardly, by allowing circumstances to come in which hinder.<a name=1:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now as to the subject before us, some may say we are not Jews, but I claim to speak of it in relation to ourselves on account of what we get in Galatians and in Romans: "Know then that they that are on the principle of faith,

		these are Abraham's sons" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#3:7">Galatians  3:7</a>), and again, "And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace upon them and mercy, and upon the Israel of God" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#6:16">Galatians  6:16</a>).<a name=2:1></a> "For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither that circumcision which is outward in the flesh; but he is a Jew who is so inwardly; and circumcision, of the heart, in spirit, not in letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#2:28">Romans  2:28</a>, 29).<a name=2:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I desire to refer to four men, as giving us, I believe, the features of the true Jew - Adam, Enoch, Abraham and Jacob.<a name=2:3></a> In the two former you have the divine side, seen objectively, and in the two latter the practical side, seen subjectively.<a name=2:4></a> The voice to Adam revealed his failure in headship.<a name=2:5></a> God said, "Where art thou"?<a name=2:6></a> He had failed to control the woman - to keep his wife near him - thus she came under the influence of Satan.<a name=2:7></a> In spite of his wonderful intelligence in naming all the animals, he allowed her to go astray, and not only failed to maintain his influence over her, but came himself through weakness by his affections under her influence in eating the fruit of the forbidden tree.<a name=2:8></a> What a contrast this presents to Christ as Head of the assembly.<a name=2:9></a> There is no sign of this in the assembly, as under Christ, the last Adam, who "loved the assembly, and has delivered himself up for it, in order that he might sanctify it, purifying it by the washing of water by the word, that <i>he</i> might present the assembly to himself glorious, having no spot, or wrinkle, or any of such things; but that it might be holy and blameless" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:25">Ephesians  5:25</a> - 27).<a name=2:10></a> Christ has died for the assembly; He nourishes and cherishes it, and thus on the <i>divine</i> side she bears no trace of having come under contrary influences, so that in her
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=3>[Page 3]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		you have the features of the true Israel of God.<a name=3:1></a> Mere knowledge of Scripture is of no avail if we have not come under Christ and been formed after Him.<a name=3:2></a> Thus Adam's failure in headship demonstrates the great necessity for the coming in of Christ.<a name=3:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in Enoch another thought comes in as illustrating another feature which is characteristic of the true Jew.<a name=3:4></a> He walked with God.<a name=3:5></a> Now this is the effect of Christ being known; it is the normal effect of receiving Christ.<a name=3:6></a> In this man we have one whose heart and mind were under the influence of God for three hundred years.<a name=3:7></a> The proof of this is seen in his naming his son Methushelah.<a name=3:8></a> There was no flood while Methushelah lived.<a name=3:9></a> While the influence of Enoch remained in his son there was no flood, his name indicating that it would not come till the one whose father had walked with God had passed away.<a name=3:10></a> The date of Methushelah's death and the start of the flood were the same.<a name=3:11></a> What a voice to us!<a name=3:12></a> Can we stay the judgment?<a name=3:13></a> After we have received Christ, God is to be our only outlook, and our life is to be marked by walking in communion with Him.<a name=3:14></a> Methushelah lived to be nine hundred and sixty-nine years old; such was the measure of his father's influence.<a name=3:15></a> "Enoch walked with God", we read, and "he was not, for God took him".<a name=3:16></a> Yet before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.<a name=3:17></a> We read also of him that he, the seventh from Adam, prophesied, saying, "Behold, the Lord has come amidst his holy myriads, to execute judgment against all" (<a href="../bible/Jude.htm#14">Jude  14</a>, 15).<a name=3:18></a> If in type he had had influence in his son as the result of walking with God, so that the flood was stayed, yet he had also recognised the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=4>[Page 4]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		need for coming judgment.<a name=4:1></a> Thus we see in Enoch not only another feature of the true Israel walking with God, but also the effect of it.<a name=4:2></a> In Adam and Enoch, as I have said, we get the objective side.<a name=4:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in Abraham and Jacob we have subjective types of how this will be worked out in the actual history of the Jews in the latter days, but which is now found in those who are Jews, not in the letter, but in the spirit.<a name=4:4></a> Abram presents the faith side; he had answered to the call of God, had broken away from the great barriers to faith, and had moved toward great realities.<a name=4:5></a> He left country, and kindred, and father's house, to inherit a land that was unknown to him.<a name=4:6></a> What Abram left in these three elements - country, kindred and father's house - hinder each one of us, I believe, more or less.<a name=4:7></a> Later, the Lord appeared to Abraham at the oaks of Mamre, as he sat at the door of his tent, in the heat of the day.<a name=4:8></a> He found time for communion, even at such a time - the heat of the day.<a name=4:9></a> Do we find time in the history of our souls for an interview of this kind?<a name=4:10></a> Are we free and at leisure for divine visitations?<a name=4:11></a> Our leisure is our own; we may be tired and oppressed in our occupation, but do we find freedom for communion and intercourse with God in our times of leisure?<a name=4:12></a> In Abraham's case three men came to him, and he instantly recognised <i>One</i> of those three as a divine Person, and said as he ran to meet Him, "Lord".<a name=4:13></a> We are not told who the other two were: perhaps Abraham did not know, but he was able to recognise the Lord.<a name=4:14></a> Then he provided refreshment, rest and comfort for them.<a name=4:15></a> Sarah his wife, in sympathy with his movements, made cakes quickly, while Abraham ran to the herd to fetch a calf and

	<div class="paragraph">
		gave it to a young man who "hasted to dress it.<a name=5:1></a> And he took thick and sweet milk, and the calf that he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood before them under the tree, and they ate".<a name=5:2></a> How sweet is this communion in the heat of the day!<a name=5:3></a> Some propose to themselves to work till toward the close of their life, then to retire and enjoy communion, but that is not the way; here we have one in communion on the journey through life, and in the heat of the day.<a name=5:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Nehemiah found occasion, even at the king's feast - the greatest monarch of his day - to enjoy intercourse with his God.<a name=5:5></a> As the king's cupbearer, with the cup of wine in his hand to give to the king, we read that immediately the king's question was put he "prayed to the God of the heavens" (<a href="../bible/Nehemiah.htm#2:4">Nehemiah  2:4</a>).<a name=5:6></a> This feature of the true Jew was seen in him even in captivity.<a name=5:7></a> That is worthy of note.<a name=5:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in Jacob we have things worked out, and the actual name of the man changed to Israel.<a name=5:9></a> In Abraham, as we have said, we have the faith side, but in Jacob the experimental.<a name=5:10></a> He counted upon God and prayed to Him for blessing, and God gave him the discipline to bring him to it.<a name=5:11></a> One incident in that discipline is recorded in the scripture we read: "He rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two maidservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok; and he took them and led them over the river .<a name=5:12></a>.<a name=5:13></a>.<a name=5:14></a> And Jacob remained alone".<a name=5:15></a> Then God drew near enough to him to touch him, and he to touch God.<a name=5:16></a> God will come near enough to be touched and to touch you.<a name=5:17></a> Have you ever been alone with God in the sense of this?<a name=5:18></a> Have you ever appreciated this when you were alone?<a name=5:19></a> Well, it was so with Jacob.<a name=5:20></a> God drew near to Jacob and

		touched him.<a name=6:1></a> We read, "A man wrestled with him .<a name=6:2></a>.<a name=6:3></a>.<a name=6:4></a> and the joint of Jacob's thigh was dislocated as he wrestled with him".<a name=6:5></a> But Jacob prevailed, to the delight of God.<a name=6:6></a> He said, "I will not let thee go except thou bless me".<a name=6:7></a> How God delights when we have power with Him!<a name=6:8></a> What a day for Israel when this is true!<a name=6:9></a> It is not terms or doctrine, but a Person, and Jacob held on and prevailed; therefore "he is not a Jew who is one outwardly".<a name=6:10></a> This experience was much to Jacob, the joint of his thigh was dislocated.<a name=6:11></a> God brought him low naturally, but enlarged him spiritually.<a name=6:12></a> His name was changed; "Thy name shall not henceforth be called Jacob, but Israel", meaning that as a prince he had power with God and with men, and had prevailed.<a name=6:13></a> What is your name, beloved - Jacob or Israel?<a name=6:14></a> Under the Lord's discipline Jacob became Israel, and through grace as Christians that is now our name - "the Israel of God".<a name=6:15></a>

		So Isaiah the prophet says, "I will record the loving-kindnesses of Jehovah, the praises of Jehovah, according to all that Jehovah hath bestowed upon us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel which he hath bestowed upon them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his loving-kindnesses.<a name=6:16></a> And he said, They are indeed my people, children that will not lie; and he became their Saviour".<a name=6:17></a> May the Lord grant that in His grace there may be with us the features of the Israel of God - not only the possession of the truth, but the expression of it, so that there may be a testimony for God here now, as there will be from the whole house of Israel in the day to come, and that all may see that we are His

		What I had before me tonight was that our affections might keep pace with the light which we have as to Christ.<a name=9:1></a> It is possible for our minds to grasp certain things about Him, but it is only as the affections are in movement that we can be preserved: we are preserved in the measure in which we love Christ.<a name=9:2></a> That is the test.<a name=9:3></a> Whether we love Christ is a test which is always applied to our state.<a name=9:4></a> All of us, young and old, have had to face temptations and matters calling for decisions, and difficulties have arisen as to how to act in these.<a name=9:5></a> Such questions would not be so full of difficulty if we were more governed by the desire to please the Lord.<a name=9:6></a> I believe that a great many of our difficulties would disappear if we had but that one desire and purpose before us, to please Him.<a name=9:7></a> We may be faced with some question which has to be decided, something in connection with our pathway, and we may say: 'I know what I would love best naturally'.<a name=9:8></a> But the point is, we are not to be regulated by that, but, as I have said, by what is pleasing to the Lord.<a name=9:9></a> We are to be governed by what is pleasing to Him, and do you not think it is a very wonderful opportunity that you and I have on this earth - that of giving pleasure to the Lord?<a name=9:10></a> Why, think of the honour of it,
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=10>[Page 10]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		think of the dignity of it, that we should have the opportunity of solving questions in relation to that which is for His pleasure!<a name=10:1></a> I think that heaven must take great interest in what is going on in that regard on this earth.<a name=10:2></a> Many a time we have questions to be decided, and, alas, many a time we give way and yield to what is natural to us; there is nothing pleasing to the Lord in that.<a name=10:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I remember very early in my own life - I do not intend to say very much about that - but I can remember how the Lord taught me a lesson just on that point.<a name=10:4></a> I was very tried by what a brother said to me on the occasion of my asking a question at a meeting.<a name=10:5></a> He said it publicly, before everyone, and I was greatly tried about it and I recall saying to myself, 'Well, I shall not take any more part in this meeting; I am not going to be treated like this', for my question and what I had to say was perfectly honest.<a name=10:6></a> But afterwards the Lord seemed to say to me, 'Take no notice of it; just go on; you have <i>Me</i> to please'.<a name=10:7></a> I can remember too, as if it were but yesterday, how the Lord gave me a sense then that while I had done violence to my own feelings, He was pleased with what I had done.<a name=10:8></a> I only mention this to show the opportunities you and I have at the present moment.<a name=10:9></a> It is an honour which might be coveted, to be regulated on this earth by what is pleasing to the Lord.<a name=10:10></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#69:31">Psalm  69:31</a>, we read, "It shall please Jehovah more than an ox, - a bullock with horns and cloven hoofs", which proves that the spirit of Christ is better than the ways of flesh.<a name=10:11></a> It turns too for a testimony, for the next verse in the psalm is, "The meek shall see it, they shall be glad".<a name=10:12></a> If you and I could get a look into heaven, we should find that

		all heaven is bowing down and owning His worth - not a discordant note there.<a name=11:1></a> Every one obeys His command; but, think of it, down here in this world such as we have the opportunity of doing Him honour in seeking to be here for His pleasure.<a name=11:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Turning now to the passages I read, my reason for referring to <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>and coupling it with <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#20">Matthew  20</a>and 21 and <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>was to show that <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>is carried forward into the New Testament and that the Lord Jesus gives it a present application.<a name=11:3></a> He does so in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#21">Matthew  21</a>, and the Spirit of God gives it a very definite present application in Hebrews, so I thought that perhaps we might profit by looking a little at the different ways in which Christ's present position is spoken of in these scriptures.<a name=11:4></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>is a very remarkable one.<a name=11:5></a> From the first Psalm onward you will find that there are those on earth who have light about the present position of Christ.<a name=11:6></a> I have no doubt that those referred to in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#8">Psalm  8</a>are those who will be here in the way of testimony after the assembly is gone; and the one point which they have got clear about, as in <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>, is the present position of Christ.<a name=11:7></a> "Why are the nations in tumultuous agitation, and why do the peoples meditate a vain thing?<a name=11:8></a>" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2:1">Psalm  2:1</a>); and it adds, "<i>I</i> have anointed my king upon Zion, the hill of my holiness" (verse 6).<a name=11:9></a> That is to say, that the remnant in that day will have the light of the present position of Christ, just as the assembly has it today.<a name=11:10></a> Through grace we have no doubt at all about it.<a name=11:11></a> I can well remember the effect upon my own spirit when our brother Mr Raven said, 'I would like you to think of what it would mean if you and I were taken off this earth straight up into

		those courts above, and had a look round as to all that is transpiring up there'.<a name=12:1></a> We would be greatly affected by the fact that the Lord Jesus is there in supremacy.<a name=12:2></a> He is absolutely supreme in heaven.<a name=12:3></a> There is nowhere there that we could look but the Lord Jesus would be acknowledged, and the effect on coming back to earth would be that we should each say, 'I am going to carry out on earth what they do in heaven'.<a name=12:4></a> That is the idea.<a name=12:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, that is the position in this section of the Psalms; there are those who have light about the position of Christ.<a name=12:6></a> It would not be possible to think of anything greater than that - to have light about Christ.<a name=12:7></a> We dwelt a little upon it this afternoon.<a name=12:8></a> It is wonderful that we in this world, in the day of the rejection of Christ, have light as to how great He is, have light as to His personal glory and His greatness, and it is wonderful too to have the opportunity down here of adjusting ourselves in relation to it.<a name=12:9></a> Now, that is what the people of God will have in the day to come.<a name=12:10></a> Then following upon <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#2">Psalm  2</a>, in the next few Psalms, <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#3">Psalm  3</a>- <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#7">Psalm  7</a>, we get a great deal of sorrow and trouble coming in.<a name=12:11></a> The people of God come into reproach.<a name=12:12></a> None of us can disguise the fact that the present supremacy of Christ is not owned on this earth.<a name=12:13></a> The world has no sense of it, and we are left in this scene, in this place of contrariety, where everything is against Him, to be here in lowliness and under the control of the One who sits on high.<a name=12:14></a>

		But then Psalm 8 ushers in the day of glory of the Son of man.<a name=12:15></a> It says, "Jehovah our Lord".<a name=12:16></a> Is it, 'How fully Thou hast met our need'?<a name=12:17></a> No.<a name=12:18></a> You may say, 'I thought He had met all our need'.<a name=12:19></a> Yes, fully; there is not a single question,

		I have to say first, in regard to this wonderful book out of which I have read a few passages, that it is the beginning of the revelation of God to us.<a name=27:1></a> Now it seems to me of immense importance that we should recognise that God has begun to speak to us, and has thrown a flood of light on the situation.<a name=27:2></a> Man naturally has no light of God, outside the revelation of God - there is no doubt of that.<a name=27:3></a> You cannot find any light of God outside the revelation of God, and so God has been pleased to introduce a whole flood of light in order to reveal what He is, and what His thoughts as to man are.<a name=27:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a vast circle of light to which we have no access, and never shall have access.<a name=27:5></a> There is an infinite sphere of light in which God dwells, which is for ever hidden from us.<a name=27:6></a> God is such, having lived from eternal ages, and living to eternal ages, that He must be, in the nature of things, hidden from the knowledge of man.<a name=27:7></a> That is to say - and it is well for us to remember it, because I think it tends to a greater reverence than we sometimes show in respect of divine Persons - the greatness of God is such, that it never does for us, however intimate we may be with Him as revealed, to forgot the fact and bearing of His

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now this book begins with, "In the beginning;" it is the book of the beginning.<a name=28:3></a> God has been pleased to come out and make Himself known to man in the activities of His love.<a name=28:4></a> You can well understand that God, having everything before Him from beginning to end, brings out, even at the earliest stage of the revelation, matters concerning that which was nearest to His heart.<a name=28:5></a> I refer, of course, to what comes out in Christ, and what comes out in regard to that which is dear to Christ - the assembly - and what comes out in regard to the family of God; although, of course, you do not get the full light until the blessed Lord comes.<a name=28:6></a> As it says, "No one has seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, <i>he</i> hath declared him" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:18">John  1:18</a>).<a name=28:7></a> Thank God, that is so, yet God, having the whole revelation before Him at the moment He began to speak to man, brings out what was nearest and dearest to His heart - what His thought was - and what He intended revealing fully in His Son.<a name=28:8></a> I say this, because I think we must all be very much struck, in the book of Genesis, with the number of strands of which its beautiful pattern is composed.<a name=28:9></a> We find, running through the book, numerous strands, so to speak; and I only propose to follow a few of them, out of the vast number which compose the book as a whole.<a name=28:10></a>

		The main subject I had before me was to bring to your notice the remarkable fact that even in this book, so early, you get a hint of John's ministry; and not only so, but of Paul's.<a name=30:2></a> What I feel is that we should lay ourselves open for the reception of truth, and the enjoyment of what these beloved apostles say to us.<a name=30:3></a> I do not mean - for the moment - the detail of it, but the grand outlines of their doctrine.<a name=30:4></a> You will wonder, perhaps, what I meant by saying that John's truth is hinted at, and I will explain.<a name=30:5></a> "Take now thy son, thine only son, <i>whom thou lovest</i>, Isaac, and get thee into the land of Moriah, and there offer him up for a burnt-offering".<a name=30:6></a> Now, that is just a little window, so to speak, letting us see what was in the heart of God in making known what He intended to bring out through His servant John; that is, that "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:35">John  3:35</a>).<a name=30:7></a> You will find that it says, "Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#25:5">Genesis  25:5</a>); so putting these two scriptures together, you see that God brings out at a very early stage what was in His mind.<a name=30:8></a> I think it is understandable that if you have a thing very much on your mind, you let it out.<a name=30:9></a> Well, God had these thoughts very much on His mind, and He has let them out to us.<a name=30:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is an immense thing for our hearts to be established in the very essence of the revelation that God has made to us through the apostle John.<a name=31:6></a> It is for our help and encouragement and enjoyment, and it seems to me that it gives a stability to us and a happiness to us to know that our souls can resort to the Father's love - to the inner region.<a name=31:7></a> Despite anything that happens here, we touch eternal realities; whatever the sorrow and trial in the assembly, or in our own circumstances, you cannot imagine any change in the blessedness of these affectionate relations.<a name=31:8></a> You cannot imagine any change between the Father and the Son, neither can you imagine any change existing between the Father, the Son, and us.<a name=31:9></a> It seems to me that this is the greatest strength and comfort to the soul; and what I feel is that it should be more our habit to resort to that bright scene connected with what is eternal, and then we can take up difficulties as stabilised by that which never moves.<a name=31:10></a> Now, I would challenge myself - and surely, in doing so, you too - as to how far our souls are established

		I should like to commend to you the subject of meditation.<a name=32:6></a> We know the trend of modern life; the rush to make a living, the demands that family and business, and even meetings make upon us, but at the same time, I do not think we ever get real strength of soul unless we cultivate the habit of meditation.<a name=32:7></a> In <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#119">Psalm  119</a>, it is mentioned numbers of times: "I will meditate upon thy precepts" (verse 15), or "thy statutes", or "thy word".<a name=32:8></a> It is not that you meditate upon nothing; you do not sit in a dreamy sort of way and think of nothing.<a name=32:9></a> That is what an Indian fakir might consider the height of happiness.<a name=32:10></a> That is not what I am speaking of.<a name=32:11></a> It is in regard to what God has been pleased to make known to us; His work, His words, and the blessed Person of our Lord Jesus Christ; in fact, all that is connected with Him in whom the whole revelation of God has been made.<a name=32:12></a> What I would like to impress upon each one is the importance of cultivating this habit, because, I think, there we get strength of soul.<a name=32:13></a> We allow the gracious rays of the love of God to shine into our hearts.<a name=32:14></a> It is not that we study the Scriptures in a natural way; I am speaking of the happy habit of meditation, which can be encouraged and cultivated.<a name=32:15></a> So in regard to this subject - the revelation of the love of the Father - I feel that we need to be in the

		In the next passage I read we find that Isaac took Rebecca into the tent, and it says, "Isaac led her into his mother Sarah's tent; and he took Rebecca, and she became his wife, and he loved her.<a name=33:3></a> And Isaac was comforted after the death of his mother".<a name=33:4></a> There, of course, we touch the doctrine of Paul, which made an immense impression on his whole course and ministry.<a name=33:5></a> Isaac took Rebecca to the tent, and "he loved her".<a name=33:6></a> There we see in figure the love of Christ for the assembly.<a name=33:7></a> I am not now referring to the dispensational thought in the "tent", but the seat of divine love.<a name=33:8></a> That is, that the love of Christ for the assembly is, and must be, hidden from the world.<a name=33:9></a> It is a private affair; it is a "tent" where the outpourings of Christ's love are poured forth on His assembly.<a name=33:10></a> All the intimacies of Christ's love are poured out inside a "tent;" they are hidden from the world.<a name=33:11></a> Who can describe them, dear friends?<a name=33:12></a> only the recipients!<a name=33:13></a> As the hymn says:

		Perhaps you might wonder why I took up the other passages - what the connection was?<a name=34:5></a> Well, I am profoundly impressed with the fact that only souls who are really in the enjoyment of what I spoke about can face things; and God is pleased to help us to face difficulties, because He works things out in detail with us.<a name=34:6></a> How often have we been impressed with the wonderful life of the Lord Jesus!<a name=34:7></a> How His life was taken up, not only with public utterances and teaching, but with wonderful incidents in His attention to individuals.<a name=34:8></a> If you read the gospels you find numbers of persons coming into contact with Him, and the immense care given by the Spirit of God to the delineation of the marvellous manner in which He dealt with individual souls.<a name=34:9></a> Here was One - God Himself come down here, the Word made flesh - and you might have thought He would set up a school of doctrine to display the greatness of God.<a name=34:10></a> No!<a name=34:11></a> He exemplified what God was in His life; in all He did and said He displayed God, and the touches in His life are so

		That is why I read those passages, because they contain, I think, a warning and an encouragement for us.<a name=35:4></a> Here we find Isaac; he loved Esau, but he loved him because of his venison.<a name=35:5></a> It was not a disinterested love - it was a love for what it could get - based on an old man's taste for food.<a name=35:6></a> It was love which had partiality; and that is where, I think, sometimes our difficulties lie.<a name=35:7></a> Is it not so?<a name=35:8></a> we love for what we can get.<a name=35:9></a> We may love a man because he is of the same calling, or the same family, or, wider still, of the same nation, or because he has similar tastes; is not such love partial?<a name=35:10></a> Do we love people because they are Christ's?<a name=35:11></a> We love people surely because they are Christ's; it is the mark of a converted soul to seek the company of God's people.<a name=35:12></a> Anything else is a contrast to the divine love I have been speaking of.<a name=35:13></a> But may we not be partial in our affections for those that are Christ's?<a name=35:14></a> You say, 'Some do not walk with us'.<a name=35:15></a> Does that change our love?<a name=35:16></a> I do not think so.<a name=35:17></a> They may erect barriers, but I think there is, and ought to be, love in each of our hearts ready to flow out to every one who is the Lord's.<a name=35:18></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		We have already had before us today the thought of service, and it is on my heart to speak of a service which lies open to every believer.<a name=55:1></a> You will have gathered doubtless from the scriptures I have read that the word 'comfort' is in my mind.<a name=55:2></a> Every one of us must feel the increasing need amongst God's people for a ministry which brings in comfort, a ministry which will establish and which will comfort their hearts.<a name=55:3></a> Indeed, one of the earliest desires of the apostle Paul in writing to the Thessalonian believers was that they might "encourage one another, and build up each one the other, even as also ye do" (<a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#5:11">1 Thessalonians  5:11</a>).<a name=55:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This need for comfort found early expression amongst the people of God.<a name=55:5></a> It will, I believe, find greater expression as the days become darker and increasingly difficult.<a name=55:6></a> It is said of Lemech that at the birth of Noah he said, "This one shall comfort us concerning our work and concerning the toil of our hands" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#5:29">Genesis  5:29</a>).<a name=55:7></a> The saints in that early day, feeling the pressure of what was around, the curse being heavy upon the earth, looked on in the fervent longings of their souls to the coming of One who should bring in rest and comfort.<a name=55:8></a> Need I remind you of the time in which Noah lived - this early comforter of the saints - how he moved and how he built in times and under conditions similar to our own?<a name=55:9></a> In his day there were abnormal men; it is said, "In
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=56>[Page 56]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		those days were the giants on the earth" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#6:4">Genesis  6:4</a>).<a name=56:1></a> A giant spirit, alas!<a name=56:2></a> is abroad today in the earth; there is hero-worship on every hand and men of renown.<a name=56:3></a> People of the world speak of their great ones, whether politically, or socially, or religiously.<a name=56:4></a> They are not ashamed to use superlative language in the description of earth's great ones or their activities.<a name=56:5></a> The unholy climax of all those activities, the apex of man's greatness as on that plane will be, as we know, the man of sin.<a name=56:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What are we to do in the presence of all that speaks of this giant spirit abroad?<a name=56:7></a> We should reserve our superlative language for Christ, the One who was marked, as it is said, by the mind to go down.<a name=56:8></a> Let us refuse in this day of man's greatness to employ any such language in the description of that man.<a name=56:9></a> Let us be like the one spoken of in the Song of Songs who, when challenged as to her lover, describes Him in befitting language; she is concerned to speak, as one may say, in the superlative degree.<a name=56:10></a> She says, "His head is as the finest gold; .<a name=56:11></a>.<a name=56:12></a>.<a name=56:13></a> His mouth is most sweet: Yea, he is altogether lovely" (<a href="../bible/SongofSongs.htm#5:11">Song of Songs  5:11</a> - 16).<a name=56:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So Noah, this early comforter of the saints, is marked by one outstanding feature: that he <i>walked with God</i>.<a name=56:15></a> It says "This is the history of Noah.<a name=56:16></a> Noah was a just man, perfect amongst his generations: Noah walked with God" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#6:9">Genesis  6:9</a>).<a name=56:17></a> He was not obsessed with what was around; he was not deterred from pursuing a path of righteousness because of the influx of man's greatness, but he was perfect.<a name=56:18></a> He stands forth distinctively perfect in his generations; and it is said, he "walked with God".<a name=56:19></a> I wish to emphasise at this time that the measure in which we
	</div>

		<a name=57>[Page 57]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		comfort one another in these last days is the measure in which we are each prepared to walk with God, for behind this ministry of comfort there lies a wealth of divine experience - experience with divine Persons, as walking in secret with God.<a name=57:1></a> Noah, thank God, was not the only comforter of the old dispensation; there were many of them, and they were concerned to speak to the heart of others.<a name=57:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is said in <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#40">Isaiah  40</a>, "Speak to the heart of Jerusalem".<a name=57:3></a> May I plead for that in relation to our intercourse one with another, in relation to any service with which the Lord in His goodness may entrust us?<a name=57:4></a> Do we make an appeal to the heart?<a name=57:5></a> Do we speak to the hearts of God's people?<a name=57:6></a> Do we appeal to that which is the seat, so to speak, of every emotion, or are we content to address the minds by imparting information about divine things or divine Persons?<a name=57:7></a> I make bold to say that if we are concerned to appeal to the hearts of God's people, there will be response; if we merely appeal to the minds there will be no response.<a name=57:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I pass on to Joseph, who was another great comforter.<a name=57:9></a> It is said of him that when suspicion came into the hearts of his brethren, when they doubted him after Jacob their father's death, he spoke consolingly to them; he spoke words of kindness to them.<a name=57:10></a> He would disarm them as to the path that lay before them; he would pour into their hearts a precious ministry of comfort so that they might know how to confide in him, and to go forward with every suspicion eliminated from their minds and hearts.<a name=57:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I refer also to Hezekiah in relation to this ministry of comfort.<a name=57:12></a> It is said of him in that day of wondrous

		recovery, that he "spoke consolingly to all the Levites" (<a href="../bible/2Chronicles.htm#30:22">2 Chronicles  30:22</a>).<a name=58:1></a> Have we had such on our hearts - the Levites?<a name=58:2></a> Have we been so pre-occupied in our service that we have forgotten the Levites?<a name=58:3></a> I well remember one of the earliest longings that I had in regard of divine service.<a name=58:4></a> It was that one might have part in that very privileged service by constantly praying for those who serve.<a name=58:5></a> I commend that to you, dear young brother or sister.<a name=58:6></a> I believe promotion lies on that line, the line of being enabled to speak comfortingly, consolingly, to the Levites, a service that is greatly needed amongst us, and a service that is to be coveted by us.<a name=58:7></a> Who knows what lies behind all the precious ministry, all the activities, and all the exercises that are given through the Levites?<a name=58:8></a> Shall we be, as it were, the beneficiaries at their hands, receiving of their spiritual wealth, and never be concerned about speaking words of comfort and words of encouragement to them?<a name=58:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is said that the result of Hezekiah's speaking consolingly to the Levites was that they held a feast seven days, and such was the joy and greatness of that feast that they decided to hold another feast for another period of seven days.<a name=58:10></a> Then when Hezekiah, this great comforter of the Levites, recognised what joy there was in Israel, we are told that he gave a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep.<a name=58:11></a> He was not too great, though he was a king, to think of the Levites who served in relation to the heart of God.<a name=58:12></a> It is said in <a href="../bible/2Chronicles.htm#32:6">2 Chronicles  32:6</a> that he also spoke consolingly to the captains of war.<a name=58:13></a> He is concerned now, having secured the praise and the service of God, as to the conflict, as to this impious enemy who would come within the gates; and

	<div class="paragraph">
		it is said he assembled the captains of war to him at the gate of the city and spoke consolingly to them.<a name=59:1></a> Have we had such in our minds?<a name=59:2></a> Have we wept with them?<a name=59:3></a> Have we sorrowed with those who have been concerned as to the maintenance of what is due to God, those who have had, as it were, the first hand in the conflict?<a name=59:4></a> Have we been near them in spirit?<a name=59:5></a> Have we prayed for them?<a name=59:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I remember an aged sister saying that one of her most privileged sights was to walk into a room where our beloved brother F.<a name=59:7></a>E.<a name=59:8></a>R.<a name=59:9></a> was, and to see him weeping - tears, priestly tears - the God-given outlet, in times of conflict for the truth.<a name=59:10></a> Such tears are put into God's bottle.<a name=59:11></a> Are we concerned as to this, that we support and speak consolingly to those who serve in the conflict?<a name=59:12></a> It is said the result of those words of consolation was that the people depended upon the words of Hezekiah the king.<a name=59:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Following upon that I want to show what a ministry of comfort may bring in among us in the last days.<a name=59:14></a> It is said that Isaiah the prophet and Hezekiah the king joined in prayer.<a name=59:15></a> What a sight for God!<a name=59:16></a> to see the prophet and the king praying together and crying to heaven in priestly intercession in relation to the people of God - the people to whom Isaiah was instructed to say, "Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.<a name=59:17></a> Speak to the heart of Jerusalem".<a name=59:18></a> What is this ministry of comfort that Isaiah the prophet would bring in?<a name=59:19></a> It is the introduction of the true Noah, the One upon whom Israel will lean, the One for whom the earth and the heavens wait during the time of the groaning creation, the advent of the true Noah who shall bring in rest, repose and comfort.<a name=59:20></a> "Every valley shall be

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I desire now to refer to the way this ministry of comfort has come down to us in our day.<a name=60:6></a> I need not remind you of the way in which the Lord Jesus came into the synagogue at Nazareth.<a name=60:7></a> He reads, and as He reads He would leave the impression upon all that He had come in at a suited moment with a ministry of comfort.<a name=60:8></a> He said He had come to bind up the broken-hearted.<a name=60:9></a> Is there not need for such a word today?<a name=60:10></a> Is there not room amongst men, amongst the saints of God, for these words - the gospel preached to the poor, the broken-hearted healed, the captives set at liberty?<a name=60:11></a> And as He moves here and there He is concerned as to bringing rest and comfort into the hearts of those to whom He draws near.<a name=60:12></a> He would have us restful.<a name=60:13></a> He says, "Learn from me; for I am meek and lowly in heart" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11:29">Matthew  11:29</a>).<a name=60:14></a> That is the kind of Person who is able to administer comfort, who is able to bring in, in times of pressure, sorrow, and tribulation, just the word of comfort that is needed.<a name=60:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One loves to think of Paul, that great comforter of the saints, standing in relation to the whole assembly.<a name=60:16></a> He is concerned that the saints should be comforted.<a name=60:17></a> Pardon the repetition of the word, but I feel how essential this feature is in the closing days.<a name=60:18></a> We have abundant light; we have among us, as few other Christians have, the most treasured things; we are privileged to hear the most profound and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=61>[Page 61]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		blessed truths, but are we to be content to hear and never to pass on to others who compose part of Christ's assembly that which we have received?<a name=61:1></a> Paul himself stands in relation to all men.<a name=61:2></a> He had the desire to present every man perfect in Christ.<a name=61:3></a> What bowels of compassion he had, just like his Master.<a name=61:4></a> He passes on, having the care of all the assemblies, daily concerned that the saints be greatly comforted.<a name=61:5></a> He himself had in that early day of his conversion recognised comfort in a most marvellous way, and when he is subdued, he, who had once been the destroyer of God's people, so ministers comfort that we read, "The assemblies then throughout the whole of Judaea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being edified and walking in the fear of the Lord, and were increased through the comfort of the Holy Spirit" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:31">Acts  9:31</a>).<a name=61:6></a> From that point his concern is, as it were, deepened.<a name=61:7></a> He had persecuted the assembly of God, he had been the destroyer of the saints; now he would fill up the time that was left - every moment of it, for it was night-and-day work with Paul - in holy endeavour to comfort the saints.<a name=61:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So, too, the Thessalonians in their early freshness needed the constant attention of a nursing father and a nursing mother, and he would send Timotheus to them.<a name=61:9></a> The very presence of Timotheus in a local gathering would ensure comfort for the saints.<a name=61:10></a> They had no room for him at Corinth.<a name=61:11></a> Paul says, "Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#16:10">1 Corinthians  16:10</a>), indicating that the tendency at Corinth would be to quench what had been divinely entrusted to Timothy.<a name=61:12></a> But at Thessalonica he is entrusted with the work, and Paul says he sent him there
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=62>[Page 62]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		in order that the saints might be comforted.<a name=62:1></a> Then it is said that he also hoped to send Timotheus to the Philippian saints.<a name=62:2></a> It is not now a question of early freshness; it is not now a juvenile company, but a company of believers well on the way to maturity - Philippian saints.<a name=62:3></a> Do we ever get beyond the need of comfort?<a name=62:4></a> What kind of vessel, what kind of keeper of the sheep is this to whom Paul would entrust the work of comforting those Philippian believers?<a name=62:5></a> He says, "For I have no one like-minded who will care with genuine feeling how ye get on" (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:20">Philippians  2:20</a>).<a name=62:6></a> Oh!<a name=62:7></a> for more genuine feeling as to how the saints get on, not as to how much they may know, but a genuine concern for their soul-health.<a name=62:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then this great comforter Paul is equally concerned about the Ephesians.<a name=62:9></a> He has in reserve Tychicus and he would send him in order that he might comfort their hearts, that the Ephesians might be acquainted with all that was happening to Paul, and that their own hearts might be greatly comforted.<a name=62:10></a> Likewise as to Colosse, Paul is concerned to know their state, and that he might comfort their hearts.<a name=62:11></a> It is not now the great apostle himself coming; it is not an official movement; it is Paul representatively; he sends this representative - Tychicus.<a name=62:12></a> He is to go to that local gathering, and find out their state and also to comfort their hearts.<a name=62:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One of the last acts of Paul, in relation to his line of service in comforting others, stood in relation to the comfort of those who were gathered around on that island after the shipwreck.<a name=62:14></a> That is one of the last recorded acts of this devoted servant of Christ.<a name=62:15></a> It is said that Paul himself gathered sticks.<a name=62:16></a> I know we have often read it, and that we
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=63>[Page 63]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		are acquainted with the scripture, but I make an appeal to every heart to reflect for one moment on the down-stooping of Christ that marked the beloved apostle, and the grace reflected in him, that he had seen in Christ.<a name=63:1></a> He himself is greatly concerned about the comfort of those who stood round during the time of the cold and rain, and it is said he gathered sticks.<a name=63:2></a> His objective was a fire that would comfort and warm the saints, and he knew that every effort of the enemy to frustrate it would find its full and final answer in the very fire that he himself would provide to warm the saints.<a name=63:3></a> He shakes off a viper, for the viper would destroy this minister of comfort among the saints.<a name=63:4></a> It is not said he killed it, but he shook it off into the fire.<a name=63:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I refer now to John, for the thought of comfort links up with John's ministry.<a name=63:6></a> He treats of the divine nature, and shows that we have wealth and power to deal with every difficulty, every problem that can arise in these difficult days.<a name=63:7></a> Jude speaks of certain men having crept in unawares.<a name=63:8></a> John says, "They went out from among us, but they were not of us" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:19">1 John  2:19</a>); they went out.<a name=63:9></a> The exposing power of John's ministry is such that evil cannot dwell where love is.<a name=63:10></a> The viper that would destroy those affections, that would militate against the warmth and comfort of the saints, can never exist in the presence of divine love amongst the saints.<a name=63:11></a> We have in John's ministry the most precious bulwark against all the unholy inroads of antichristian men today as they move about in this earth, and if John himself is confined to Patmos he moves out in an endeavour to comfort the saints, and says, "I John, your brother and fellow-partaker in the tribulation" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:9">Revelation  1:9</a>).<a name=63:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If he himself is restricted as to his movements, he refers to one whose movements are unrestricted, for he is like Paul, he leaves behind a keeper of the sheep.<a name=64:1></a> Paul leaves a Timothy to keep the sheep, to protect them on church lines and to comfort them in relation to the assembly and the affections proper to it.<a name=64:2></a> John, too, is concerned about his keeper, and in that connection he refers in the most touching way to Gaius.<a name=64:3></a> Gaius is found as one who has a house, and a house that is a home.<a name=64:4></a> What marks him, having the spirit of John, is that he is greatly concerned, not so much how the brethren come into his house, but the manner in which they go out.<a name=64:5></a> I commend that to you in all simplicity, that we should have deeper concern about the way in which the saints leave our houses.<a name=64:6></a> Are they, as those who have visited the house of Gaius, the better for having been in?<a name=64:7></a> Are they comforted?<a name=64:8></a> Have they received all this spiritual warmth which is contained in John's ministry?<a name=64:9></a> Are they sent forward in a manner worthy of God?<a name=64:10></a> John is greatly concerned about the family life of the saints.<a name=64:11></a> He would comfort the saints in that relation - that is, as the family of God.<a name=64:12></a> The family of God is left down here in a hostile world, and if the world loves its own, let us see to it on our part that we love our own, that in those family affections we should be concerned as to the outgoings of divine love.<a name=64:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One of the earliest, and certainly one of the sweetest impressions that one had of the saints in the path of separation, as first moving amongst them apart from the systems of men, was to go into a meeting where they were singing, 'Whom have we, Lord, but Thee?<a name=64:15></a><a name=64:14></a>' (<a href=".<a name=64:16></a>.<a name=64:17></a>\hymns\hymns1972.<a name=64:18></a>htm#427:1">Hymn 427</a>).<a name=64:19></a> I confess that it left upon my spirit an indelible impression.<a name=64:20></a> It

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In closing I refer to Peter.<a name=65:7></a> Peter's great concern is to comfort the saints in relation to their kingdom sufferings.<a name=65:8></a> He leaves to Paul the line of the assembly, the one who was filling up that which was behind of the sufferings of Christ for His body's sake - the line of suffering, which, one feels ashamed to say, we touch so little.<a name=65:9></a> Peter's suffering stands in relation to the kingdom.<a name=65:10></a> We are to arm ourselves against every unholy intrusion of the flesh, forasmuch as Christ has suffered for us in the flesh.<a name=65:11></a> John's sufferings, I believe, stand in relation to the spirits of believers, as being found still in a hostile and antichristian system of things, but Peter is concerned about the souls of the saints.<a name=65:12></a> He says, "Abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#2:11">1 Peter  2:11</a>).<a name=65:13></a> He is concerned about soul-health.<a name=65:14></a> He would have the saints prospering in their souls, and so he brings in a word of comfort in relation to any who may be suffering, suffering on the line of the kingdom, and his greatest and

		deepest concern in view of his departure is that the saints might be greatly comforted.<a name=66:1></a> Would he leave the sheep without a keeper?<a name=66:2></a> Would he pass off without leaving the saints a precious legacy?<a name=66:3></a> I believe he leaves the legacy to us in the one whose salutation he speaks of when he says, "She that is elected with you in Babylon salutes you, and Marcus my son" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#5:13">1 Peter  5:13</a>).<a name=66:4></a> One has derived comfort from that thought, that in a place like Babylon you have Peter, shortly to put off his tabernacle, as he says, and you have Mark.<a name=66:5></a> Ah!<a name=66:6></a> we cannot do without the kingdom; we need to be maintained in the exercises relative to it; we need to be maintained in the joy and power of it.<a name=66:7></a> Let us never assume, God forbid!<a name=66:8></a> to rise so high that we forget the line of Peter's ministry relative to the kingdom, and so he speaks of "Marcus my son".<a name=66:9></a>

		I would refer briefly for a moment to the legacy that Mark has left behind in the ordering of the Lord in his gospel.<a name=66:10></a> It has sometimes occurred to me that in Mark's gospel we have portrayed, more deeply than in any other, the feelings and sensibilities of Jesus.<a name=66:11></a> I believe that Mark was a man of deep feeling, and that, consequent upon his early failure, he would be in direct touch with divine Persons.<a name=66:12></a> When he is restored and strengthened, he is spoken of as being profitable for the ministry, and his gospel is a precious legacy handed on to us, a gospel in which the feelings and sensibilities of Jesus are treated of in a most delicate way by divine inspiration through "Marcus my son".<a name=66:13></a>

		The simple thoughts that are in my mind centre around the name of Jesus.<a name=69:1></a> While they are simple, as becomes one's measure, one recognises and desires that the Spirit of God might give enlargement both to the speaker as he speaks, and to the hearers as they listen.<a name=69:2></a> What should mark speaking about divine things is not only that God furnishes what is to be spoken, but that those who speak enter into what is spoken in true affection and sympathy.<a name=69:3></a> <a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#45">Psalm  45</a>opens with, "My heart is welling forth with a good matter: I say what I have composed touching the king.<a name=69:4></a> My tongue is the pen of a ready writer".<a name=69:5></a> I feel sure that when the heart is full, God will provide the words.<a name=69:6></a> I would rather have a full heart than a mind stocked with facts or information, or even the ability to quote scripture, for it is out of a full heart that the tongue becomes as the pen of a ready writer - not a ready speaker, but a ready writer, for all man's thoughts have to be controlled in order to be kept within the range of what is written.<a name=69:7></a> Our minds are never given liberty to travel outside of that, but within that region the tongue becomes as the pen of a ready writer, and what subject is more precious, or more blessed, than that of Jesus.<a name=69:8></a> No measure is too simple or too small to compose something about Him.<a name=69:9></a> It

		We have been considering together the supreme blessedness of the thought that God has come down to man, that He has brought Himself within man's compass or range.<a name=70:2></a> God is very great, and man compared with Him is very small, and if God in His greatness is going to bring Himself thus before the notice of man in his smallness, what down-stooping it involves.<a name=70:3></a> There was no other but Jesus who could travel that way; no other who could set God forth, for He not only represented God and declared God, but He was God.<a name=70:4></a> What a subject for contemplation, to consider the way He travelled and the point to which He stooped in order to bring to us the knowledge of God!<a name=70:5></a>

		I have turned to Luke's gospel for two reasons.<a name=70:6></a> One is that that gospel presents the moral order in which we apprehend things; the other is that the gospels, in general, furnish us with the most intimate thoughts about the person of Jesus.<a name=70:7></a> The epistles speak much of His official glories.<a name=70:8></a> They unfold to us the varied and glorious offices He has taken up in order to make the will of God effective in us, and in order to meet the need of His people and to support them in the presence of God.<a name=70:9></a> But the gospels produce the spirit of adoration, for we are brought close to Jesus as He moves and speaks to men.<a name=70:10></a> Luke presents Him as beginning at the lowest point and being carried to the highest point; for in his second discourse - the Acts - where he continues to compose as touching the king, he tells us the disciples "were gazing into heaven, as he was going" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:10">Acts  1:10</a>), showing not only that the Lord had gone to the highest

		point, but that the gaze of His people had been directed to that spot.<a name=71:1></a> Just think what a range of contemplation there is for our souls between these two points - a Babe lying in a manger, and a blessed Man having passed through death in triumph, carried up into heaven!<a name=71:2></a> I understand that the thought of carrying is that there is support; that is, the affections are intelligently engaged as loving the Person, and as apprehending where His pathway leads.<a name=71:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I begin at the point in the scripture where the angel appears to Mary with the salutation, "Hail, thou favoured one!<a name=71:4></a> the Lord is with thee" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#1:28">Luke  1:28</a>).<a name=71:5></a> The Lord was with her to support her in receiving a marvellous communication, a communication so great indeed that without support she would have been overwhelmed.<a name=71:6></a> She was to bear a son and call His name <i>Jesus</i>; that is the first name indicated by the angel; the second name is that He should be called the <i>Son of the Highest</i>.<a name=71:7></a> There is nothing more lowly than Jesus, and nothing greater than the Son of the Highest, so that, as reading Luke's account, we are to carry these two suggestions of surpassing lowliness and surpassing greatness combined in one Person.<a name=71:8></a> In down-stooping grace He who was, and is, God, came into manhood at the lowest point, at the point, shall I say, where there is the least likelihood that anyone should be dismayed, bearing no external evidences of official glory and dignity - a babe lying in a manger.<a name=71:9></a> That was the sign to the shepherds (chapter 2: 12); they should find the babe lying in a manger.<a name=71:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The suggestion carries two thoughts, as I see it: one that the manger represents a lower point in down-stooping

		grace than is seen in the mother.<a name=72:1></a> The mother would suggest the reality of His humanity, born of a woman, a holy yet real humanity, but the manger is descent in grace below man's ordinary circumstances altogether.<a name=72:2></a> The other thought is that whatever distinction attaching to Mary as favoured above women, it was not to be confused or merged with the distinction attaching to the Babe, called the Son of the Highest.<a name=72:3></a> When Mary and Joseph are referred to at the same time as is the Babe, the Babe is said to be "lying in the manger".<a name=72:4></a> We do not get the thought of the Babe being carried by a mother; that would have been what is natural, and God is developing here what is spiritual.<a name=72:5></a> The first person recorded as receiving the Babe in his arms is Simeon.<a name=72:6></a> He carried the Babe.<a name=72:7></a> Think of it!<a name=72:8></a> What a subject for contemplation!<a name=72:9></a> He had been waiting long for Him; the waiting would suggest the preparation, for no one could have such a holy privilege without moral preparation.<a name=72:10></a> He was waiting for the consolation of Israel; those arms, so to speak, had been prepared, they had been strengthened by God that he might carry the child Jesus, so he said, "Lord, now thou lettest thy bondman go, according to thy word, in peace; for mine eyes have seen thy salvation".<a name=72:11></a> There was nothing more in life for Simeon; he had reached the consummation, the goal, the end for which he had been waiting.<a name=72:12></a> He could now depart in peace, without an anxious thought, for he had seen God's salvation.<a name=72:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next point I wish to notice is that while the name of Jesus had been indicated to Mary in this gospel, and to Joseph in Matthew's gospel, there was a period of eight days elapsing before the name was given.<a name=72:14></a> You will notice

	<div class="paragraph">
		I now refer to another name called over Him, in chapter 3, where the heaven was opened and a voice came out of heaven, "<i>Thou</i> art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight" (verse 22).<a name=73:7></a> Only God could give Him that name; only God could say, My beloved Son.<a name=73:8></a> He does not stand in that relation to any other but God.<a name=73:9></a> That is His great distinction in manhood; He is called the beloved Son.<a name=73:10></a> No angel could give Him that name; only the voice of God coming out of an opened heaven could declare a name so sacred and so marvellous as the "beloved Son".<a name=73:11></a> It represents, I understand, what that Person is to God in manhood; but the name of Jesus represents what He is to every one of His people, in that down-stooping, lowly, but blessed pathway that His feet marked out in the movements of His love.<a name=73:12></a> It is as Jesus that He has come into our hearts, as Jesus that He has made Himself indispensable and precious to every one of us.<a name=73:13></a>

		The name Jesus is not so much what is official, although that underlies it, but rather what is personal; and every one of His saints is marked by a personal link with Him as Jesus.<a name=74:1></a> Even little children take that name upon their lips; it does not dismay.<a name=74:2></a> It stands for the way that blessed divine Person has taken that He might secure possession of our hearts.<a name=74:3></a> I will give you an illustration of how it works in the conversion of Saul of Tarsus.<a name=74:4></a> You will recall that as he was journeying to Damascus, a light shone out of heaven and a voice was heard saying, "Saul, Saul, why dost thou persecute me?<a name=74:5></a>" and Saul said, "Who art thou, Lord?<a name=74:6></a>" Lord is a title of authority; it represents what is official and great, but the answer that came back was, "<i>I</i> am Jesus" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:4">Acts  9:4</a>, 5).<a name=74:7></a> He would not overwhelm that man, lying with his face on the ground, by speaking of titles of dignity and glory, though every title of eminence belongs to Him, but Oh!<a name=74:8></a> the comfort poured into that wounded heart by that name, Jesus: "<i>I</i> am Jesus".<a name=74:9></a> What could we do without Him?<a name=74:10></a> How could we walk a single day without that Person?<a name=74:11></a> How could we ever come into the presence of God in all His greatness, without Jesus?<a name=74:12></a> We should be overwhelmed, we could not stand it, we could not support it apart from Jesus.<a name=74:13></a> The blessedness of the presence of God, and indeed heaven itself, is only possible for creatures such as we are because of Him - the One who came into manhood, marked by this lowly grace, who drew near to sinners, who did not overwhelm them, but attracted the lowly and the outcast - Jesus, our precious, adorable Saviour.<a name=74:14></a>

		and through another writer, we get the same thoughts that I have tried very briefly to suggest from the gospel by Luke.<a name=76:1></a> In the opening verse which I read we find the writer falling at His feet as dead.<a name=76:2></a> I want to ask everyone in this room, every believer, Have you ever fallen at His feet as dead?<a name=76:3></a> You will never get a true conception of the greatness of Christ apart from that experience.<a name=76:4></a> Had we known such an experience in reality, there would be less familiarity with us when we speak to the Lord, less formal repetition, and less activity when we are out of communion.<a name=76:5></a> The passage suggests how great the Lord is; only God could give us at once the thought of supreme greatness and supreme lowliness and gentleness in one Person; only God could do that.<a name=76:6></a> The one who saw Him in His official dignity and glory standing in the midst of the seven lamps, prepared to move amongst the assemblies to use His discerning eye, to look underneath the surface and to expose what was there, was affected so deeply that he fell at His feet as dead.<a name=76:7></a> Such is the greatness of Christ!<a name=76:8></a> And then the book goes on to unfold how God is going to take things up in a day to come.<a name=76:9></a> One gathers from such a book marvellous impressions of the greatness of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=76:10></a> He is going to intervene in the world and bring great things to pass, such things as have never happened in the world's history before.<a name=76:11></a> We read of events that make the heart of man tremble and fear, for they are marvellous indeed, and as we read through the book we get this conception, that that blessed Person is able to deal with everything in the world.<a name=76:12></a> As we look at the world today, we may get the impression that it is a conquering system, for it goes on from one step of

		progress to another, from one invention to another, and there seems to be, as men think, no limit to what the mind of man will eventually accomplish.<a name=77:1></a> But as we read this book we get an impression of the greatness of Christ, and that He is able to deal with it all.<a name=77:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is possible that as we read it there might perhaps unconsciously come into our souls a sense of distance, because He is so great, and fills such high offices, and is marked by such dignity, and power, and distinction.<a name=77:3></a> But the book closes with that precious word, "<i>I</i> Jesus".<a name=77:4></a> To those who read He is still that same Person; to hearts that adoringly would follow Him through the great movements recorded in the book, He is still "Jesus".<a name=77:5></a> He will not allow any sense of distance to come between Himself and those who love Him; and so He presents Himself in that blessed way, bringing in that wonderful word, "<i>I</i> Jesus".<a name=77:6></a> Oh!<a name=77:7></a> what does that recall?<a name=77:8></a> It recalls all that He is to our hearts as known in the wonders of His grace; it recalls One well-known through all life's history - "<i>I</i> Jesus".<a name=77:9></a> And then He adds further what is well worth noting, "<i>I</i> Jesus have sent mine angel to testify".<a name=77:10></a> There are angelic activities at this moment in the assemblies to testify to Him.<a name=77:11></a> He is the same Jesus; it is in that character that He has sent His angel that our hearts might be comforted and our souls supported by the sweet and blessed sense that He who, in the greatness of His person, is God, has become a Man.<a name=77:12></a> It is in manhood He has gained our affections, and He is going to remain in manhood for ever.<a name=77:13></a> He came out of eternity, out of conditions into which we cannot look or penetrate or understand, but He has come into time.<a name=77:14></a> He came as a Babe;

		Well, as I said at the beginning, I had on my mind the simple desire to speak of Jesus.<a name=78:2></a> I hope everyone in this company has a link with Him; and that there has been in your life that period of pondering, of contemplation, giving the sense that what is in Him is so great that it can fill your mind and heart for time and eternity, so that in some measure you are taking your part in the carrying and maintaining of the testimony of God, for things have to be supported today.<a name=78:3></a> God is working through His people and by His people.<a name=78:4></a> He is not seen in any other way; He is working morally and has confined His activities in this dispensation to His people.<a name=78:5></a> What is of Christ needs support: it needs arms, like those of Simeon, that have been waiting, it needs that readiness to go, to depart, to make way for Him, so that, as John the baptist said, "He must increase, but I must decrease" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:30">John  3:30</a>).<a name=78:6></a> It needs all that.<a name=78:7></a> As we contemplate the great events of one's life, possibly going into death (what a solemn moment that is to one; even for the believer it is an intensely solemn thing to die), our comfort is that Jesus died.<a name=78:8></a> He went that way; and we could not go that way without being overwhelmed, had He not gone, and did He not take us by the hand as we go.<a name=78:9></a> And again if we take the thought of weeping, for the life of a man of God today is marked by much weeping, well, Jesus wept.<a name=78:10></a> What a contemplation!<a name=78:11></a> Jesus weeping.<a name=78:12></a> Think of who He is, and what He is, and what He has come to do and how He is going to fill all things!<a name=78:13></a> The One who is going to fill all

		I read of two further appearings, one in which the name of God is declared to him: "I am the Almighty God" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#17:1">Genesis  17:1</a>).<a name=82:6></a> In that appearing he received great accession in regard of the name and character of God, and it was a real spiritual experience.<a name=82:7></a> If he got an accession to his spiritual capital by this declaration of the name of God, his name also was changed; for that, I take it, would be a principle, that where there is a fuller revelation of the name of God, the name of the recipient of that revelation would also have a corresponding change.<a name=82:8></a> Thus he is now called Abraham, a change of name, corresponding to the name of God who was thus revealed to him, and vaster prospects were opened to him; he would not only have the land, but far greater blessing would accrue.<a name=82:9></a> What a moment for his soul to receive a revelation of that kind!<a name=82:10></a> God was revealed in this wonderful way, and Abram accepted it.<a name=82:11></a>

		Then again in the other appearing of which I read (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#18">Genesis  18</a>) there was even a higher privilege conferred upon Abraham, for he was placed in the position of ministering to the Holy One, of ministering refreshment to God.<a name=83:1></a> That is a most wonderful state of things, that Abraham should be so privileged that he should prepare a meal and minister to this blessed Visitor!<a name=83:2></a> Thus, in his case, there is a progression in the character, nature and extent of the intimacy of the appearings, and so it is with us.<a name=83:3></a> I believe that in these divine manifestations which are made to our hearts, there is a progression and increase in the character of the manifestations enjoyed.<a name=83:4></a> How wonderful to think that we, too, can have such manifestations of God and of the Lord Jesus to our hearts, so that we can minister to Them.<a name=83:5></a> How this bows our spirits in adoration and reverence before the One who so reveals Himself!<a name=83:6></a>

		Now I come to Moses in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#34">Exodus  34</a>.<a name=83:7></a> Moses, who was often in touch with the Lord, here desires to see His glory, and the Lord graciously responded, and declared His name before him, and, in the light of that appearing, Moses can go through the wilderness in the knowledge of God's wonderful character: "Merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in goodness and truth".<a name=83:8></a> God was declared in such a light as to enable Moses to carry out his heavy responsibilities, and to conduct the people of God through the wilderness under the impulse of that manifestation.<a name=83:9></a> I believe that every servant, in order to do any work which is entrusted to him, has to have a manifestation of the character of God or of the Lord, which will fit him for the conduct of that spiritual enterprise,

		however small or however great the service.<a name=84:1></a> If he is to serve the saints rightly, the servant must have an apprehension of the character of God which will fit him for the carrying out of what is laid upon him; and that held good with Moses.<a name=84:2></a> The manifestation of God in this manner just suited the character of the moment and exactly brought out what Moses required to know of God, and of the character in which he should represent God to the people.<a name=84:3></a> With this manifestation of God to Moses he gets also a great sense of his own insignificance, so that he could say, "Alas, this people has sinned a great sin .<a name=84:4></a>.<a name=84:5></a>.<a name=84:6></a> And now, if thou wilt forgive their sin .<a name=84:7></a>.<a name=84:8></a>.<a name=84:9></a> but if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#32:31">Exodus  32:31</a>, 32); as much as to say, I do not mind about myself, let the people of God be blessed, and if my extinction will help their blessing, let my extinction take place.<a name=84:10></a> That would be quite in keeping with the manifestation of God, and would be the right spirit surely of a servant.<a name=84:11></a> So God confirms His servant in his service.<a name=84:12></a> He recognises him, and Moses goes forth to that arduous service in the light of that particular manifestation of God to his soul.<a name=84:13></a>

		Now, as to the next incident that I read (<a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#3">1 Kings  3</a>), that of Solomon, and the Lord appearing to him in a dream, I would point out that it was a very great thing for Solomon to recognise that the source of wisdom was in God, and that God was prepared to give it to him.<a name=84:14></a> I think that has a very practical bearing on our souls; for there are occasions in which the greatest spiritual wisdom is needed.<a name=84:15></a> There are difficulties arising constantly amongst and regarding the Lord's people, and where are we to go?<a name=84:16></a> Whom are we to

		<a name=85>[Page 85]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		address for the solution of those difficulties?<a name=85:1></a> Solomon at the outset of his career addressed the right Person and found the right source; he found in a manifest way that the wisdom he needed for ruling so great and numerous a people was to be found in God alone, and so must we.<a name=85:2></a> We may take all sorts of measures and investigate all avenues, so to speak, in order to find the wisdom to meet a certain difficulty, but we are brought to the fact that wisdom comes only from God.<a name=85:3></a> In regard of the assembly it comes from her exalted Head, and all of us should have the strong impression from the Lord Himself, and from God Himself, that that is where the source of wisdom lies.<a name=85:4></a> So we do not act restlessly, wandering about, so to say, for guidance, much as we value the advice of our brethren through whom wisdom is often ministered to our souls; for, through whomsoever the wisdom comes, the source of it is the assembly's Head!<a name=85:5></a> What rest it gives to the spirit to know that there is no difficulty the solution of which does not lie in the mind of God, and that it is possible for us to get it!<a name=85:6></a> It was surely the humble spirit in Solomon that got that answer; it was the lowly spirit that did not seek his own greatness.<a name=85:7></a> If there is any spirit of desiring to be great the Lord will not give us wisdom; but in the absence of that and having a pure desire to serve the Lord's people, God will give the answer.<a name=85:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there is another great effect of the manifestation of the Lord, and that would very rightly be found in a prophetic book.<a name=85:9></a> Isaiah said, "I saw the Lord .<a name=85:10></a>.<a name=85:11></a>.<a name=85:12></a> high and lifted up".<a name=85:13></a> What he discovered there was the holiness of God.<a name=85:14></a> The impression of that appearing was the extreme
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=86>[Page 86]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		holiness of God; and I do verily believe that is what every one of us has to learn in a deeper way, the holiness of God and His presence which, while it attracts us, is profoundly real in its searching character.<a name=86:1></a> The invariable effect of the presence of God on us is to induce an acknowledgment of the holiness that is His, and thus it banishes from us all that lightness that naturally characterises us.<a name=86:2></a> Lightness and the want of depth in us are banished in such measure as we are in the presence of God and have the sense of His holiness.<a name=86:3></a> That holiness came out in the cross is obvious; that it came out in all its deep and wonderful character there is surely known to all of us; but its realisation is one of the great points in our spiritual history, and one which has not only to be attained, but maintained.<a name=86:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I pass on now to the instances in the New Testament.<a name=86:5></a> I shall first say a word about the first great appearing of the Lord to the apostle Paul.<a name=86:6></a> It is one of many appearings, as the Lord said, "For this purpose have I appeared to thee, to appoint thee .<a name=86:7></a>.<a name=86:8></a>.<a name=86:9></a> a witness both of what thou hast seen, and of what I shall appear to thee in".<a name=86:10></a> So there were many appearings to the apostle during his life, but this was the first, the great initial appearing.<a name=86:11></a> I suppose it was the greatest and it had a profound effect upon him.<a name=86:12></a> I have no doubt that with any servant of the Lord who seeks to serve Him, an analogous experience takes place.<a name=86:13></a> That is, there is a real spiritual appearing of the Lord (not in vision like this, of course) which marks the character of the ministry.<a name=86:14></a> I think there is that with each of us who are servants of the Lord, and surely we all here are servants of the Lord, bondmen of Jesus Christ, and whether the work is small or
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=87>[Page 87]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		great, the Lord will give us, as He gave Paul, a distinct impression of His commission.<a name=87:1></a> You cannot run without a commission; you cannot engage in service without a distinct impression of the Lord.<a name=87:2></a> It may be feeble - I do not think it was feeble with Paul - but it must be there, and that appearing will characterise the whole of the ministry of the servant.<a name=87:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is very important to notice that the germ of the whole of the double ministry of Paul is contained in what the Lord said to him here.<a name=87:4></a> I refer to the ministry of the assembly, and the ministry of the gospel.<a name=87:5></a> The ministry of the assembly is obviously contained in germ in the wonderful and beautiful expression, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?<a name=87:6></a> .<a name=87:7></a>.<a name=87:8></a>.<a name=87:9></a> <i>I</i> am Jesus whom <i>thou</i> persecutest".<a name=87:10></a> We know it well.<a name=87:11></a> It contains the germ of the whole ministry of the assembly which was developed in fuller measure in Paul as he went on his course, and was the secret of all his devoted labour.<a name=87:12></a> If he knew and acknowledged that the assembly which he had persecuted was really Christ, he was prepared to prove Christ's love to the assembly in himself to the utmost, whether he were loved or not: "If even in abundantly loving you I should be less loved" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#12:15">2 Corinthians  12:15</a>).<a name=87:13></a> He loved and served the assembly which Christ loved.<a name=87:14></a> That is the real motive of service to the assembly; we are so impressed with Christ's love to the assembly, and what it is to the heart of Christ, that we love to serve it.<a name=87:15></a> It will prepare us for acting in the meanest capacity, and though we may know but little about it, it will bring suffering to us.<a name=87:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there is another feature in this appearing which I would point out; that is, the close connection and
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=88>[Page 88]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		intertwining of the two ministries.<a name=88:1></a> The Lord immediately goes on to give Paul his evangelical ministry, how he should go to the nations to open their eyes, "that they may turn from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God".<a name=88:2></a> That is the evangelical side, though without the slightest doubt it was in view of the assembly, so that those of the nations thus reached should become part of that wonderful vessel of which I have spoken.<a name=88:3></a> You see how the two ministries are intertwined there; they are not divorced; "What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#19:6">Matthew  19:6</a>).<a name=88:4></a> That is, there is to be no divorce between the ministry of the gospel and the ministry of the assembly; they would be mutually conducive to each other's progress, and they are both impressed upon the apostle at this wonderful appearing.<a name=88:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have already referred to the many appearings that were made to Paul, and of some we have a record.<a name=88:6></a> For instance, when he came to Jerusalem and wanted to stay there and preach, the Lord appeared to him in an ecstasy and said, "Make haste and go quickly out of Jerusalem" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#22:18">Acts  22:18</a>).<a name=88:7></a> He pleaded with the Lord, and said he would like to stay: "Lord, they themselves know that <i>I</i> was imprisoning and beating in every synagogue those that believe on thee; and when the blood of thy witness Stephen was shed, I also myself was standing by and consenting, and kept the clothes of those who killed him" (verses 19, 20).<a name=88:8></a> But the Lord became insistent and said, 'You are to go'.<a name=88:9></a> The Lord is able to appear to His servants to give them directions for service, and while we may have to gather much as to His will, there is such a thing as the Lord giving
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=89>[Page 89]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		peremptory instruction, and I suppose every servant knows what that is; you cannot argue; you <i>must</i> do it.<a name=89:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		That was the result of one appearing of the Lord to Paul; and, again, when the apostle was in some distress because he had made an error before the council, that very night the gracious Lord stood by him and said, "Be of good courage; for as thou hast testified the things concerning me at Jerusalem, so thou must bear witness at Rome also" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#23:11">Acts  23:11</a>).<a name=89:2></a> He would fulfil his service, and he would go to Rome and testify for the Lord there.<a name=89:3></a> The Lord is so gracious; He knew that the heart and the motive were right, and He would comfort His servant.<a name=89:4></a> Then again, we read that after he had been caught up to the third heaven, which was indeed more than an appearing, when he came down he was given the thorn for the flesh, and found it very trying for himself, a man of so impetuous and active a character.<a name=89:5></a> He besought the Lord thrice to take it from him, but the Lord said, "My grace suffices thee; for my power is perfected in weakness" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#12:9">2 Corinthians  12:9</a>).<a name=89:6></a> So he was called to suffer this, that he might find the power of Christ resting upon him.<a name=89:7></a> That was a gracious, comforting word of the Lord to him, and showed what a deep interest the Lord took in His servant, and how His grace was sufficient for this and everything of that kind.<a name=89:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When again at the end of his arduous life of service he stands before that inhuman monster whom he calls "the lion", and all the saints at Rome, who seem to have been very timid, deserted him, and no man stood by him, the Lord again manifested Himself to him, as he says, "The Lord stood with me" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#4:17">2 Timothy  4:17</a>).<a name=89:9></a> Do you think the Lord
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=90>[Page 90]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		would desert His servant though all deserted him?<a name=90:1></a> Never; He made Himself known in full support to His servant.<a name=90:2></a> Oh!<a name=90:3></a> do we not feel it, that it is only as He supports us that we have courage?<a name=90:4></a> It is only as He supports us that service is at all effectual, so that, as he says, "through me the proclamation might be fully made".<a name=90:5></a> But He does support us, as He supported His aged servant at that moment.<a name=90:6></a> We see thus how Paul was well acquainted with these wonderful manifestations and communications from the Lord.<a name=90:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in the last passage I read (<a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>) we have a different note.<a name=90:8></a> We should expect the apostle John to present things to us in a character corresponding to his ministry, and thus we find here the character of the manifestations of the Lord from John's aspect.<a name=90:9></a> "He that has my commandments and keeps them, he it is that loves me; but he that loves me shall be loved by my Father, and I will love him and will manifest myself to him".<a name=90:10></a> This then is a manifestation of affection.<a name=90:11></a> I do not mean that the others were not given in affection, but the stress here is laid upon affection, so that the manifestation is really one of pure affection.<a name=90:12></a> It is not a manifestation here for service, but a manifestation for affection: "He that loves me shall be loved by my Father, and I will love him and will manifest myself to him".<a name=90:13></a> Now that is a real spiritual experience.<a name=90:14></a> Would to God we knew more about it!<a name=90:15></a> And I may say that it is not a bit of use reading this beautiful passage of Scripture and never experiencing the truth of it.<a name=90:16></a> I believe there are many believers who constantly admire and find comfort in this chapter, but who have not really experienced

		what this verse speaks about.<a name=91:1></a> But it is open to us.<a name=91:2></a> You say, 'How is it open to us?<a name=91:3></a>' Love obeys, and that is how it is opened to us: "He that has my commandments and keeps them".<a name=91:4></a> So it is by the simple way of obedience.<a name=91:5></a> I do not know what you find, but I find in myself there is a great danger of not being simply obedient to the Lord.<a name=91:6></a> We may not be distinctly, directly and completely obedient to what the Lord tells us, and that is why we do not get these manifestations, for do you mean to tell me for one moment that love does not desire to bestow this favour?<a name=91:7></a> Of course it does.<a name=91:8></a> Do you mean to say that the Lord does not wish to manifest Himself to each of us?<a name=91:9></a> Of course He does, and the only thing that prevents Him, I believe, is our lack of obedience; but if obedience is there, and we love Him, He will certainly manifest Himself to us.<a name=91:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we may know a little about it or may know a great deal about it, but one feels we should all be exercised as to our experience of these things.<a name=91:11></a> Opposers say there is nothing in it but mere imagination; but manifestations of the Lord are real; and what is the effect in the soul?<a name=91:12></a> It is that the love of Christ is very near to us, very warm in our hearts, and we greatly appreciate it and enjoy it.<a name=91:13></a> I cannot explain its effects better than that.<a name=91:14></a> There is a realisation of His love in a deeper sense than ever.<a name=91:15></a> If I may refer to the collective thought, I believe the same holds good.<a name=91:16></a> We should never be content with a mere description of things, but we should realise when He comes to us.<a name=91:17></a> Not that we can claim it in a public way, but nevertheless the reality remains, and it should be our happy privilege, not only that we should read about it, but that we should experience it.<a name=91:18></a> I

		do believe it is of the utmost importance that such spiritual experiences as I have referred to should be known by every one of us, and, if what I have said tends to send us to the Lord in prayer to see what it is that prevents them being ours, I shall be glad indeed.<a name=92:1></a> As this chapter (<a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>) shows us, faith, however great, is not enough.<a name=92:2></a> It says, "Ye believe on God, believe also on me", and that, I understand, we all do.<a name=92:3></a> We all do believe on Him, there is faith, and that gets us over our difficulties and makes us go on so that we do not lose heart.<a name=92:4></a> As I said before, it keeps us going on steadily; but the Lord would have us enjoy more than that, namely the manifestations of Himself to our hearts, whether in love, or in any other of the aspects presented in these scriptures, for I have touched but the fringe of the subject.<a name=92:5></a> Let us then earnestly seek them in the power of the Spirit given to us, with the knowledge that all these experiences are possible for us, if we are exercised.<a name=92:6></a> May they become the real experience of our souls for His name's sake.<a name=92:7></a>

		What I want to suggest, beloved brethren, is the importance of subjection; and, with the Lord's help, I would desire to indicate that, if we are to be in accord with the mind of God in any relationship or position in which God has set us, or if we are to be prepared for that eternity that lies ahead into which we are about to enter, subjection is imperative as a state that is wrought in our souls; not simply that as to certain actions, we obey, but that the spring of those actions, is a state of subjection that exists in our souls.<a name=93:1></a> One feels the importance of it more because of the intensely solemn moment in which our lot is cast in this world.<a name=93:2></a> Without doubt we are rapidly drawing near to the moment that I read of in the epistle to the Thessalonians, when one will be revealed whom the Spirit of God calls by name - "the lawless one", or, as the AV gives it, "that Wicked".<a name=93:3></a> There is about to appear the great leader, whose characteristic feature and name is lawlessness, and the darkening influences that will reach a climax with his presence on earth are already here.<a name=93:4></a> The smoke of the pit out of which he comes - for it says that he ascends out of the bottomless pit - is already filling the earth, darkening every right influence that has hitherto governed the minds of men, affecting every relationship where subjection is proper.<a name=93:5></a>

		In the wisdom of God, from our very birth, we are brought into a position in which subjection is the first feature.<a name=94:1></a> As children, the mind of God for children is subjection.<a name=94:2></a> The influence of the lawless one is being felt intensely in that relationship.<a name=94:3></a> Those of us who have children feel intensely the darkening there.<a name=94:4></a> Then, if I refer just for a moment to women, the mind of God for the woman is subjection to the man; but the influence of the lawless one from the pit is breaking that down.<a name=94:5></a> Again, as to the wife, her place according to the mind of God is subjection to her own husband; that too is being destroyed.<a name=94:6></a> The principle of subjection to the higher powers, is the mind of God in respect of government; it is being undermined everywhere.<a name=94:7></a> The principle of subjection of the servant to his master is being abandoned everywhere.<a name=94:8></a> I need not say that that which professes to be the church is manifestly abandoning that subjection.<a name=94:9></a> The awful influences of lawlessness are darkening this scene, and God, I am sure, would save us from it, by conveying to our hearts the blessedness of subjection, not that we accept it as inevitable, but that we accept it as <i>loving</i> it.<a name=94:10></a>

		that certain features of subjection were expressed here, in measure, before He came; but one loves to think that everything that has been right and of God was but the backward glow of the rising sun.<a name=95:1></a> As the sun comes up and we get the present shining of it, there still remain the beams of light that go backward, and every feature that was of God, from Abel onward, was really the beaming of that blessed light, that <i>great light</i> that the Lord speaks of: "The people sitting in darkness has seen a great light" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#4:16">Matthew  4:16</a>).<a name=95:2></a> The apostle Peter speaks of it, "The Spirit of Christ which was in them" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:11">1 Peter  1:11</a>), not that we imply it was there, or read it into it, but it <i>was</i> there; the Spirit of Christ was there "in them".<a name=95:3></a> So, if Abel was marked by subjection, which lies behind the Lord calling him "righteous Abel", it was that which he derived from Christ.<a name=95:4></a> If Abraham was subject to the divine command, "Go out of thy land, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#12:1">Genesis  12:1</a>), he went out as subject.<a name=95:5></a> Of Moses God said, "my servant Moses" (<a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#12:7">Numbers  12:7</a>); and of David He said, "I have found David my servant" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#89:20">Psalm  89:20</a>).<a name=95:6></a> These were men who were subject to God as having the Spirit of Christ.<a name=95:7></a> But I wanted just to indicate, as the Lord may give grace, some sense of the perfection of subjection as seen in Christ Himself.<a name=95:8></a>

		I wish, beloved brethren, to say a few words on possibilities, hoping that the Lord may awaken in us individually the sense of the possibility of response Godward that exists in a believer in our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=135:1></a> If God awakens affections in us, and gives us to realise the tremendous possibilities for Him of lovers of Jesus in a scene like this, we should all be prepared to commit ourselves more wholly and entirely to divine things.<a name=135:2></a> Our beloved Lord is set before us as One who "being rich" - and who can say the riches that belong to that blessed Person?<a name=135:3></a> - all things were His both in heaven and on earth; yet such an One "became poor", and for the definite objective that we might be enriched.<a name=135:4></a> The intention of God for His people is that they should be in the possession of spiritual wealth by the blessed knowledge of Himself; and in that wealth be able to meet any situation, no matter how dark, or appalling, or difficult, for the glory of God.<a name=135:5></a> The knowledge of God is calculated to make believers entirely superior to the whole course of this age, and to the whole power of evil, and to all their own infirmities.<a name=135:6></a>

		It is evident from the book of Job that the blessed God is working with individual souls, and with a perfect understanding of every one of them.<a name=159:1></a> When God works, He works to reach a most glorious end; but it is necessary to note that Satan is working as the enemy of the blessed God, as is seen in Job himself.<a name=159:2></a> How strikingly those deep soul exercises of his are brought before us at the outset of the book!<a name=159:3></a> Little did Job know that he was of such great interest to God, or to Satan in view of his malignant ends.<a name=159:4></a> To realise this, I think, helps us when passing through those exercises that go on in our souls - those indescribable exercises that we cannot always understand.<a name=159:5></a> But in all this, God is arriving at <i>His own end</i>.<a name=159:6></a> He who has begun the good work will as surely finish it.<a name=159:7></a> How often we have to fall back on what Job said to God: "I know that thou canst do everything, and that thou canst be hindered in no thought of thine" (chapter 42: 2).<a name=159:8></a>

		God has much to say to Job at the end of this book.<a name=161:4></a> As you turn page after page and read the remarkable utterances they contain, and it comes home to you that Job's trouble was self-occupation, you can well conceive of Satan looking on and saying, 'As long as I can keep him occupied with himself, he will never get ahead'.<a name=161:5></a> But God was going to complete His work and bless Job in spite of himself.<a name=161:6></a> So at length Job says, "Behold, I am nought: what shall I answer thee?<a name=161:7></a> I will lay my hand upon my mouth".<a name=161:8></a> He had talked about himself long enough, now he was through.<a name=161:9></a> Earlier he had said, "Oh would that my words were written!<a name=161:10></a> oh that they were inscribed in a book!<a name=161:11></a>" (chapter 19: 23).<a name=161:12></a> It is extraordinary what self-occupation does for us.<a name=161:13></a> We actually think it would be a good thing to have a record of it!<a name=161:14></a> Job's words were inscribed in a book, but not for the object he desired; he had no idea that his words were going to be put in a book to show the <i>end</i> of Job.<a name=161:15></a> But he did arrive at that end, and in doing so he arrived at glory.<a name=161:16></a>

		I want to make one other remark in connection with the place the <i>senses</i> are given in this book.<a name=162:3></a> Satan is fully active and will make an appeal to our senses.<a name=162:4></a> We have God-given senses.<a name=162:5></a> What would Job have done without them?<a name=162:6></a> He would not even have heard the "whisper" if he had not had the sense of hearing; so I believe we would do well to ask ourselves why God has given us <i>our</i> senses.<a name=162:7></a> This is a day of voices, innumerable voices, and by them Satan seems to be making a particular bid for men.<a name=162:8></a> I suppose nothing in the world conveys more definitely its utter confusion than the babel of voices that comes over the <i>air</i>, and Satan is behind that.<a name=162:9></a> The question for us is, For what are we using our senses?<a name=162:10></a> How are we using them?<a name=162:11></a> A doctor said to me the other day, 'Think of the human body - such a perfect piece of mechanism - it is so wonderful that only God could have formed it'.<a name=162:12></a> If we thought of our senses, of the marvellous way in which they show God's immense power, we should exercise more care as to how we use them.<a name=162:13></a> For what are we using our eyes and our ears?<a name=162:14></a> Evidently God gained Job's ear, and his eyes too!<a name=162:15></a> May He gain ours also!<a name=162:16></a> Indeed, may <i>all</i> our senses be wholly given over to God.<a name=162:17></a> Satan had kept Job occupied with himself, through his three friends, for a long time, but finally God speaks to him in a "whisper", yet in a marvellous way, about His own handiwork in the creation of the world.<a name=162:18></a> And as God describes what He does in the animal world, Job becomes less and less, until he says, "Behold, I am nought".<a name=162:19></a> Henceforth God and His work become everything to him.<a name=162:20></a>

		You will notice in Luke's gospel that the matter of <i>daily need</i> is connected with <i>the kingdom</i>; whereas in <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#30">Proverbs  30</a>it is related to <i>sonship</i>.<a name=166:2></a> I would speak first of the kingdom in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#12">Luke  12</a>, where things are presented in a comforting kind of way.<a name=166:3></a> Special attention is drawn to the knowledge which the Father has of our daily need, and to His care and His pleasure, all of which is most comforting.<a name=166:4></a> It has in view that the people of God are to be entirely different from the men of the world.<a name=166:5></a> Our dignity is that of having to do with God in the matter of daily maintenance.<a name=166:6></a> Men generally look to their own resources, but we recognise that God is the giver of all good.<a name=166:7></a> Perhaps one of the greatest thoughts as to God as known to men is that He is the Giver, and in His kingdom God would set up His people so that <i>they</i> shall be marked by the same feature - that of giving.<a name=166:8></a> To give like God it is not only material wealth that is needed.<a name=166:9></a> A man of the world might give out of His abundance, but he would not give as God does.<a name=166:10></a> To give like God involves some sacrifice, for God's giving was based on sacrifice - He gave His only-begotten Son, in which connection there would be deep feelings in the heart of God.<a name=166:11></a> That was a mighty transaction that deeply moved the heart of God; and He would set His people up here in the kingdom in the dignity of givers - not only givers of interest and of income, but givers of capital.<a name=166:12></a> Saints are exhorted to, "Sell what ye possess and give alms".<a name=166:13></a> The dignity of divine giving even as it is expressed in the saints is to be on the basis of sacrifice.<a name=166:14></a> We are to hold what we

		The passage in Luke draws attention to two spheres of man's labour.<a name=167:2></a> One is the agricultural sphere, where men sow and reap and have storehouses and barns; the other is the manufacturing sphere, where men toil and spin.<a name=167:3></a> In contrast to that, our attention is drawn to God's achievements in creation; we are invited to consider the ravens and the lilies, to take note that although they have been in existence for a long time, they are not extinct.<a name=167:4></a> In the history of Scripture both the ravens and the lilies go back a long way, but they are still here with us.<a name=167:5></a> The ravens have neither sown nor reaped, nor have they had storehouses or barns, but God has fed them.<a name=167:6></a> The lilies have neither toiled nor spun, but God has clothed them.<a name=167:7></a> What a faithful God!<a name=167:8></a> And if He is faithful to that which is small, how much more should we be able to count upon Him to be faithful to that which is most valuable in His eyes - His people!<a name=167:9></a> I am bold to say that God's people are the most valuable of the divine possessions today; they are of immense value to God.<a name=167:10></a> Not only have they been bought by the blood of Christ, but they have been the subjects of divine care; and the Spirit of God is carrying on in them a divine work that has eternity in view.<a name=167:11></a> These are valuable things of great moment to God, and yet they are joined up with a mortal body - with a frail condition of manhood absolutely dependent upon God - needing food and clothing.<a name=167:12></a>

		You all will notice the different setting in the passage in Proverbs which is the book of sonship.<a name=169:1></a> In that passage there are two prophetic words, and the fact that they are <i>prophetic</i> is to be noted as indicating that a day would come in the history of the testimony when these words would take on a definite meaning.<a name=169:2></a> Here, the question is raised, "What is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou knowest?<a name=169:3></a>" The Spirit of God has thus prophetically indicated that in the last days - in the days when the truth of sonship would be definitely before the saints - a question would be raised as to divine names, and I hope to show you, I trust on the authority of Scripture, that this matter of daily need is interwoven with this prophetic utterance, it is there in the wisdom and forethought of God.<a name=169:4></a> The man Agur in the passage in Proverbs himself expresses the desire to have his circumstances regulated.<a name=169:5></a> Agur desires it - a notable matter; for, generally speaking, we view our circumstances in a loose, indefinite way as something which God Himself orders apart from us, and without much regard to <i>our</i> prayers and <i>our</i> feelings.<a name=169:6></a> But this man, in the middle of this prophetic utterance which is of the deepest import at the present moment, turns to prayer - a most remarkable prayer.<a name=169:7></a> He says, "Two things do I ask of thee; deny me them not before I die: Remove far from me vanity and lies; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with the bread of my daily need: lest I be full and deny thee, and say, Who is Jehovah?<a name=169:8></a> or lest I be poor and steal, and outrage the name of my God".<a name=169:9></a>

		I would refer now, briefly, to the great features of this dispensation, indicated in <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#30:4">Proverbs  30:4</a>, "Who hath ascended up into the heavens, and descended?<a name=171:2></a>" The point where Christ disappeared from man's sight was in His death and burial.<a name=171:3></a> He disappeared out of the sight of man, and His further movements are entirely unknown to the world.<a name=171:4></a> The death and burial of Christ form the last bit of history in relation to Him that could be taken account of by the world.<a name=171:5></a> Believers are to understand that through His ascension a glorious era has been opened up, in which divine movements are to be marked by these two directions, ascending and descending, which are the first features of God's house (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#28:12">Genesis  28:12</a>).<a name=171:6></a> We should be conscious of these movements up and down.<a name=171:7></a> In the day to come the glory of the Lord will cover the earth as the waters cover the sea, but at the present moment there are movements ascending and descending - marvellous divine movements in which divine Persons are engaged.<a name=171:8></a> It is in this way that saints are to be conscious of what is connected with the glorious dispensation in which they live.<a name=171:9></a>

		I had in mind, dear brethren, to refer to the soft gentle voice of Jehovah as suggesting the voice of the Lord Jesus.<a name=175:1></a> If the testimony of God is to be continued here in a living way it is dependent, on our side, on the continuance of the condition among us of having ears to hear.<a name=175:2></a> Those who have such ears can be assured, even as John in Patmos, that the personal voice will be directed to them, however trying the circumstances of the testimony may become.<a name=175:3></a> As having ears to hear we are to be like John, and turn to see the voice, being assured by our personal acquaintance with Christ that it is no ordinary voice, but that the Lord personally is speaking.<a name=175:4></a> Attention on our part will result in further acquaintance with Himself and His mind as to the assembly and the testimony of God.<a name=175:5></a> As I have said, the continuance of the testimony depends upon His voice being heard, and so Paul, in whom this continuance in the testimony is pre-eminently seen, was chosen "to see the just one, and to hear a voice out of his mouth" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#22:14">Acts  22:14</a>).<a name=175:6></a> It was personally to Paul, for he says, "They that were with me beheld the light, and were filled with fear, but heard not the voice of him that was speaking to me" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#22:9">Acts  22:9</a>).<a name=175:7></a>

		It is before me, dear brethren, to speak about the service of God.<a name=187:1></a> The subject is a large one, so large that it is not possible to refer to more than a few features.<a name=187:2></a> In these I have more what is elementary in mind, hoping that the Lord may use the occasion to secure some of the young people here definitely for the service of God.<a name=187:3></a> There are certain stipulations in the passages before us connected with the service of God that we should note.<a name=187:4></a> The first is that He is to be served <i>acceptably</i>, the second that He is to be served <i>continually</i>, and the third feature - which I particularly wish to emphasise - that He is to be served with <i>reverence and godly fear</i>.<a name=187:5></a> It is to produce these feelings in us - feelings that are proper to the presence of God - that we are told that "our God is a consuming fire".<a name=187:6></a> We are told in another place that "God is love" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:8">1 John  4:8</a>); that is most attractive and is intended to set us in movement in answer to the love of God.<a name=187:7></a> We are also told that "God is light" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#1:5">1 John  1:5</a>); that is intended to regulate us in the presence of God, so that we may serve Him acceptably according to the light.<a name=187:8></a> But this feature before us, that of a consuming fire, is of immense importance, especially to young people.<a name=187:9></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

		You will notice that, linked up with the verses I read in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12">Hebrews  12</a>and 13, we are encouraged to pursue certain things.<a name=190:2></a> They are things that the fire will not consume, the fire will not have to say to them - brotherly love, hospitality, honourable marriage, conversation without the love of money, boldness in the face of man as counting on God as our helper.<a name=190:3></a> All these things go along with the thought of serving God acceptably, with reverence and with godly fear, and continually by the offering of the fruit of the lips confessing His name.<a name=190:4></a> Our God loves to hear His people confessing His name, and the name of the Lord Jesus.<a name=190:5></a> He Himself would energise and maintain the service by the Holy Spirit so that it may be maintained according to the divine standards and go on in continuity - beginning down here on earth in the midst of a scene of confusion and opposition, but continued in heaven in favourable circumstances, the same service to the same God.<a name=190:6></a> There it will be our holy and happy privilege to praise God with the fruit of the lips.<a name=190:7></a>

		I have referred to the case of Moses in the Old Testament to show you how a man is educated for the service of God.<a name=190:8></a> You will remember that Moses had already spent two days in what he thought was the service of God.<a name=190:9></a> He had come, so to speak, from the university of Egypt, and was versed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and no doubt it was in the exercise of that kind of wisdom that he occupied those two days of service.<a name=190:10></a> On the first day he slew

		an Egyptian and hid his body in the sand.<a name=191:1></a> On the second day, he saw two Hebrew men striving together, and when he intervened, one turned upon him in derision.<a name=191:2></a> On the first day we are told that "he turned this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he smote the Egyptian" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#2:12">Exodus  2:12</a>).<a name=191:3></a> On the second day, when one of his brethren derided him, he feared and then fled.<a name=191:4></a> Two days of service, but not acceptable, nor with reverence and godly fear, nor with the feature of continuity.<a name=191:5></a> Moses fled.<a name=191:6></a> After forty years in the desert, years which would eliminate the teaching of Egypt and make him observant of the features of divine teaching, he came to the mountain of God, to Horeb.<a name=191:7></a> As he passed by, he saw a sight that attracted his attention, a thorn-bush that burned with fire and was not consumed.<a name=191:8></a> Moses said, "Let me now turn aside and see this great sight".<a name=191:9></a> Notice, he calls it a <i>great</i> sight.<a name=191:10></a> Moses, as a man of faith and as having been in the school of God for forty years, calls it a <i>great sight</i>, and he turns aside to see.<a name=191:11></a> It was a critical moment in his history when he turned aside to see, for we are told that Jehovah "saw that he turned aside to see".<a name=191:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to apply this, dear brethren, in a practical way, asking if all here have seen this great sight and if in answer to it you have turned aside.<a name=191:13></a> Some of you young people have passed through the schools and colleges of Egypt - the world - and you have learned certain standards of greatness and wisdom, but God is calling upon His people to look at a sight which outwardly is small and obscure, and yet is one of the great marvels in God's universe - that a bush should burn with fire and not be consumed.<a name=191:14></a> The bush evidently

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		alludes to the lowly circumstances into which the Lord Jesus came, typified in the wilderness.<a name=192:1></a> The bush actually burned, according to the scripture, and this would point to what God was amongst His people as seen in the wilderness.<a name=192:2></a> Let me ask you, have you turned aside to see this?<a name=192:3></a> Has this sight deflected the course of your life, so that you have turned aside from that which you were pursuing, in order to look at this great sight?<a name=192:4></a> God is attracting this man, as He would attract you; He wants you for His service, and He must educate you for it Himself.<a name=192:5></a> God must be the Teacher, but how He delights to call attention to what He is in Christ among His people.<a name=192:6></a> When this man turned aside, God called to him out of the bush and said, "Moses, Moses!<a name=192:7></a>" Twice that name is repeated, meaning that he is intimately known and that God is claiming him for His service.<a name=192:8></a> You will remember in the case of Samuel, a boy, that Jehovah called him.<a name=192:9></a> Three times He called him by his name of Samuel, but the fourth time He said, "Samuel, Samuel!<a name=192:10></a>" as though He would assert His right to claim that lad for His service.<a name=192:11></a>

		There are many young people here; I want to challenge you as to whether you have made a start on this line.<a name=192:12></a> No doubt most of you have faith in Christ, and have received the forgiveness of sins, but are you marking out your life for yourself and leaving God out, or only giving Him part of it?<a name=192:13></a> He would invite you to turn aside to see a great sight, and when He notes that you turn aside, He will give you a distinctive part in this happy service of praise.<a name=192:14></a> He will call you by name, as showing His knowledge of you, His interest in you, His claim to you.<a name=192:15></a> Now Moses has first to

		a consuming fire.<a name=195:1></a> Elijah bids the prophets of Baal to choose a bullock, and to sacrifice first.<a name=195:2></a> There are two bullocks: one represents a matured, large appreciation of Christ; the other represents an idolatrous imitation.<a name=195:3></a> They take their bullock and sacrifice it, and then they call upon the name of their god.<a name=195:4></a> I would specially ask you to notice the skill of Elijah in the way he mocked them.<a name=195:5></a> Elijah knew the true God; he knew that if the true God moved on a journey He would come down to His people, that He does not go on a journey which takes Him away from them.<a name=195:6></a> He knew that when God took a journey, it was to express His interests and concern in His people.<a name=195:7></a> Many times God came down to comfort and establish faith, and to show His pleasure in those that were engaged in His service.<a name=195:8></a> Elijah knew that "He that keepeth Israel will neither slumber nor sleep" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#121:4">Psalm  121:4</a>), and so he mocks them, suggesting to them that their god is meditating, or that he is gone on a journey, or perchance he is asleep.<a name=195:9></a> There is no answer, neither by voice nor by fire.<a name=195:10></a> Only Jehovah the God of Israel can answer by fire.<a name=195:11></a>

		Beloved brethren, I would touch on the subject which came before us at the commencement of our meetings this morning - the application of the relationship of father to the households of the children of Israel in the land of Egypt; indicating, as our brother brought before us, a foreshadowing of what should mark the Christian household in the way of divine affections.<a name=199:1></a> We were speaking in the afternoon of the triumph that the blessed Lord Jesus has brought us into; and not alone of the triumph, beloved brethren, but also of the depths of sorrow that He descended into, the depths of suffering, and the wrath of God which fell upon Him that we might be brought into liberty, that by the Spirit's power there might be happy households formed under the control of the blessed Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=199:2></a>

		In <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>we come to another scene, which appeals in solemnity to the affections of the heart of the believer.<a name=199:3></a> The Lord Jesus is on His way to death; the supper table has been passed, and He is going on that last journey.<a name=199:4></a> The torrent Cedron is about to be crossed, and Gethsemane to be entered; and in that solemn moment He speaks to His own in blessed, holy, appealing intimacy, and yet in words so simple that they cannot be misunderstood.<a name=199:5></a> My idea was to allude, just for a moment or two, to three questions asked

		of the Lord by His disciples.<a name=200:1></a> He says to them, "Ye know where I go, and ye know the way".<a name=200:2></a> The Lord Jesus had told them that He was going to prepare a place for them, and that He was coming again to receive them to Himself.<a name=200:3></a> Then Thomas says to Him, "Lord, we know not where thou goest, and how can we know the way?<a name=200:4></a>" How blessed of Thomas thus to inquire of Jesus!<a name=200:5></a> Let us all remember that, notwithstanding his failure at a crucial moment, Thomas stands out before us on the occasion of the sickness and death of Lazarus, as an example of self-sacrificing love.<a name=200:6></a> You will recall that Jesus said, "Let us go into Judaea again" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#11:7">John  11:7</a>); and His disciples said, "Even but now the Jews sought to stone thee" (verse 8); upon which Thomas said, "Let <i>us</i> also go, that we may die with him" (verse 16).<a name=200:7></a> The Lord Jesus took note, beloved brethren, of these breathings of affection that came from the disciples' hearts, and so in response to Thomas's question in chapter 14 Jesus said, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life.<a name=200:8></a> No one comes to the Father unless by me".<a name=200:9></a> He sweetly opens up to Thomas what I believe is involved in <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#11:28">Matthew  11:28</a> - 30, "Come to me, all ye who labour and are burdened, and <i>I</i> will give you rest.<a name=200:10></a> Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest to your souls; for my yoke is easy, and my burden is light".<a name=200:11></a> The point, to my mind is this - the rest was only to be found as they came to the Father.<a name=200:12></a> And the Lord was bringing them to that blessed knowledge of the Father.<a name=200:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At one of our meetings recently, we were speaking together regarding the Father and the yoke.<a name=200:14></a> How those words of the Lord Jesus so sweetly appeal to every

		believer's heart here!<a name=201:1></a> "Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am meek and lowly in heart".<a name=201:2></a> It was asked, what the yoke indicated.<a name=201:3></a> The precious answer was this: 'It indicated the Father's love'.<a name=201:4></a> Another brother, now with Christ, a few minutes afterward added, 'Might it not be said in connection with that answer, it indicated doing the Father's will?<a name=201:5></a>' There may be other applications of that scripture, but, oh, beloved brethren, Thomas's question brings out from the Lord the thought of coming to the Father by Him and, I might add, bearing the yoke that He bore.<a name=201:6></a> We would not only delight in the Father's love and bask in it, but we would delight in His <i>will</i>.<a name=201:7></a> That is the point we are brought to.<a name=201:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then another question is put, or desire expressed.<a name=201:9></a> How blessed are these questions!<a name=201:10></a> They have brought forth answers that have been treasured in the hearts of believers ever since they were asked!<a name=201:11></a> And so Philip says, "Lord, shew us the Father and it suffices us".<a name=201:12></a> They had been walking with the Lord, they had known His blessed presence, and hence He appeals to Philip and says, "Am I so long a time with you, and thou hast not known me, Philip?<a name=201:13></a>" Oh, beloved brethren, what a voice to us as exercising us, in view of our gathering together, if the Lord will, tomorrow morning!<a name=201:14></a> The Lord Himself, precious to every heart!<a name=201:15></a> His love will come before us, that love of which we were speaking this afternoon, which holds the assembly in His hand as His delight and treasure.<a name=201:16></a> We have in Him the setting forth and manifestation to us of all that is in the Father's heart.<a name=201:17></a> The Son of God in love declares what

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One word more: The other question asked was by Judas, not the Iscariote.<a name=202:2></a> How we can think of the Lord there on that occasion in all humility stooping down as one with His own, inviting their company, and freely speaking to them of the Father and the place He had won for them!<a name=202:3></a> Judas then asked this pertinent question, "Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself to us and not to the world?<a name=202:4></a>" The Lord in reply said, "If any one love me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our abode with him".<a name=202:5></a> This is the precious portion of the believer now, the consciousness of the abiding of the Father and the Son, as in response to keeping the Son's word.<a name=202:6></a> How like these divine Persons thus to make their abode with us!<a name=202:7></a> Thus we can bow our hearts in thankfulness that the Lord Jesus has brought to light the Father's love in such a way that we can be conscious of it, and know the support of divine Persons - the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit - in relation to the divine system.<a name=202:8></a> May God bless the word.<a name=202:9></a>

		Following what we have had before us, one read these scriptures with the idea of speaking of David as a type of our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=203:1></a> Even in the day of his rejection, David became the centre of attraction.<a name=203:2></a> We heard earlier that while Saul was king, the people discerned moral features in David which caused them to come to him.<a name=203:3></a> This chapter refers to days in which he was rejected and chased by Saul, the man of the flesh; but there were those who loved David and came to him.<a name=203:4></a> One might say that Ziklag, in principle, represents David acquiring a place in our hearts, not by what he is officially, but morally.<a name=203:5></a> Ziklag represents the epistle to the Romans, in which the Lord Jesus, dear brethren, is presented in His moral features and greatness as One who has recovered everything for God; so that we are attracted to Him and come to Him.<a name=203:6></a> The Lord Jesus stands out in such a distinct way, morally, that we feel we are not only safe as with Him, but we want to help Him by taking on responsibility.<a name=203:7></a> One would suggest to every one of us the importance of not only coming to our David, but of being His helpers.<a name=203:8></a> It is a precious thing to be identified with Christ even in rejection, but the tendency is to go only so far and not be <i>helpers</i>.<a name=203:9></a> Instead of being a help in connection with the truth, we often hinder it.<a name=203:10></a> I put the question to everyone here: Are we furthering or hindering the work of God in our local meeting?<a name=203:11></a> We may be opposing those who are standing for

		Christ, instead of being with those who are fighting for Him.<a name=204:1></a> It says here, "Mighty men who helped him in the conflict; armed with bows, using both the right hand and the left".<a name=204:2></a> How skilful they were, being as effective with one hand as with the other in fighting, typically, for Christ.<a name=204:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There were also those who came to him in the wilderness.<a name=204:4></a> We might say that position follows the first suggestion made of having power to reject the man after the flesh and to break links with everything in the world, so that it becomes a wilderness to us.<a name=204:5></a> The more we are in the company of the Lord Jesus, the more the world will become a wilderness to us, and the more definitely we come to Him as in the wilderness: "And of the Gadites, there separated themselves to David in the stronghold in the wilderness mighty men of valour".<a name=204:6></a> We are well content to be inside the circle of the Lord's people, and blessed that position is!<a name=204:7></a> But we are not of much value to the Lord unless He becomes so attractive to us that everything else around becomes a wilderness.<a name=204:8></a> We often sing:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<blockquote>This world is a wilderness wide;<br>We have nothing to seek nor to choose.<a name=204:10></a><a name=204:9></a> (<a href=".<a name=204:11></a>.<a name=204:12></a>\hymns\hymns1972.<a name=204:13></a>htm#139:1">Hymn 139</a>)</blockquote>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But we have to challenge ourselves as to whether we sing that hymn honestly.<a name=204:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I pass on to those who assembled to Hebron, even all Israel.<a name=204:15></a> They came to David to transfer the kingdom of Saul to him.<a name=204:16></a> They say to David: "Jehovah thy God said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel .<a name=204:17></a>.<a name=204:18></a>.<a name=204:19></a> and they anointed David king over Israel according to the word of Jehovah through Samuel" (<a href="../bible/1Chronicles.htm#11:2">1 Chronicles  11:2</a>, 3).<a name=204:20></a> It is very encouraging to see that the word

		of God had such an effect upon their hearts that they were prepared to move as in accord with God about David, to give him the kingdom.<a name=205:1></a> We also see what the mind of God is regarding Christ, and are prepared to give Him His rightful place as Head over all things to the assembly.<a name=205:2></a> In the light of Ephesians we may ask ourselves whether we are learning to move intelligently and unitedly in relation to the Lord Jesus.<a name=205:3></a> This is what characterises persons in the Ephesian position, they are moving in unity with regard to what God is doing about His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=205:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there are others who came to David with a perfect heart: "All of them men of war, keeping rank in battle array, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel".<a name=205:5></a> One, in reading this chapter, had this verse particularly in mind - as to whether we are keeping rank.<a name=205:6></a> It is a military position suggested here and <i>our</i> position is a military one, for the truth of Hebron has to be guarded.<a name=205:7></a> Are we keeping rank with a perfect heart, in our local meeting, or are we making trouble?<a name=205:8></a> Is our eye single, or have we a motive behind what we do?<a name=205:9></a> It may not be that we are displacing Christ personally, but we may be displacing those in the meeting who are standing for Him.<a name=205:10></a> The verses read speak of keeping rank in <i>battle array</i>; they are very suggestive, and so full of meaning.<a name=205:11></a> As we recognise the supremacy of our Lord Jesus Christ we are of one heart and so want Him to be King over all Israel, or, in authority in the assembly.<a name=205:12></a> We want to see His greatness displayed, as King over all the earth.<a name=205:13></a> That is the position the Lord Jesus will finally acquire.<a name=205:14></a> Those of Israel named here discerned David's kingly qualifications and greatness, and came to Hebron not only with a perfect heart, but with <i>one</i>

		heart.<a name=206:1></a> One cannot stress too strongly the importance of unity in our meetings; where unity prevails, instead of two or three hearts, or two or three opinions, there would be one heart and one voice.<a name=206:2></a> We may be assured that what the Lord could effect in those days of which we are speaking, He can do today.<a name=206:3></a> It says, "Until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:13">Ephesians  4:13</a>).<a name=206:4></a> In result, our spirits are united; we think and do the same thing.<a name=206:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The chapter goes on to say that "they were with David three days, eating and drinking; for their brethren had prepared for them".<a name=206:6></a> It is a fitting climax to this beautiful scene; this is what the Lord wants to effect in us, and amongst us, so that we can be in communion with our Lord Jesus Christ, eating and drinking what the brethren have prepared for us.<a name=206:7></a> It finally says, "For there was joy in Israel".<a name=206:8></a> Not only are they marked, dear brethren, by love for David, but are eating and drinking what their brethren had prepared for them.<a name=206:9></a> It is a matter of great importance as to how we move relatively; as we are free from the world and the man of flesh, the Lord would bring us together in the holy circle, with holy feelings and affections, not only as loving one another but as providing for one another.<a name=206:10></a> May it be so, for His name's sake!<a name=206:11></a>

		One would like to encourage the young people who have been brought to the Lord and who have a desire to serve Him, by saying that the Lord will not send you out without your having experienced what is in your own heart, as well as your knowing the One whom you would serve.<a name=207:1></a> I suppose some time may have passed since the Lord first met Peter in <a href="../bible/John.htm#1">John  1</a>and this experience in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#5">Luke  5</a>.<a name=207:2></a> Peter had been going on with his usual business, but the time came when the Lord would secure him for service.<a name=207:3></a> With this in view the Lord put Himself in touch with Peter in circumstances in which He would require his boat, and from this He taught the crowds.<a name=207:4></a> Then when He ceased speaking, He says to Peter, "Draw out into the deep" (verse 4).<a name=207:5></a> They draw out, and the Lord gives them the wonderful draught of fishes, which so affects Peter that he falls down at Jesus' knees and says, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord" (verse 8).<a name=207:6></a> Peter was being prepared for service, but the Lord would not take him up apart from a real knowledge of himself, yea, not until he had learned his own heart, otherwise he could not rightly serve the Lord.<a name=207:7></a> How needful it is to learn our own hearts in this way, in order to serve.<a name=207:8></a> The Lord desires to make use of every one of us, but He would have us learn that we are <i>sinful</i>.<a name=207:9></a> So immediately Peter comes to the consciousness of his own sinfulness and confesses it, the Lord says to him, "Fear not; henceforth thou shalt be catching

		The scripture at the end of John's gospel gives the public restoration of Peter.<a name=208:3></a> He had passed through a good deal of bitter experience, in which he had learned more of the deceitfulness and sinfulness of his own heart, in that he failed very seriously, even to the extent of denying the Lord.<a name=208:4></a> But the Lord comes in and fully restores him, and thus gives a fresh touch of His love to Peter's heart.<a name=208:5></a> He then indicates to him a new sphere of service - shepherding the sheep, feeding the lambs.<a name=208:6></a> But the Lord also brings in another thing, and that is the path of suffering.<a name=208:7></a> I do not know if we are all prepared to accept this.<a name=208:8></a> This is a time when the saints are being tested more than ever.<a name=208:9></a> We see the saints in many places and in many countries subjected to suffering.<a name=208:10></a> It is a path that has been marked out for us by the Lord Himself, as Peter in his first epistle says, "Wherefore also let them who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls in well-doing to a faithful Creator" (chapter 4: 19).<a name=208:11></a> It is not a path of our own choosing, but one into which we are divinely called.<a name=208:12></a> The Lord indicates it to Peter when He says, "When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst where thou desiredst; but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and bring thee where thou dost not desire.<a name=208:13></a> But he said this signifying by what death he should glorify God".<a name=208:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is of great encouragement to us to know that the Lord has called us to serve and to suffer, as seen in Peter, also to know that He would bring us into the light of the glory of His Person as seen in John, whose ministry is to abide until the Lord come, remembering that if there is suffering there is also glory to God secured through it.<a name=210:12></a> May the Lord encourage us all to take this path.<a name=210:13></a>

		There is much in the plain, as of old, that is calling for God's destruction in judgment (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#19:17">Genesis  19:17</a>, 25, 28, 29); but the hill tells of His own handiwork.<a name=223:5></a> "Be strong in the grace which is in Christ Jesus" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:1">2 Timothy  2:1</a>).<a name=223:6></a> Timothy, like Phinehas, is to be a man of the hill, for the Spirit's power in spiritual elevation is the power of resurrection.<a name=223:7></a> He who pervaded this scene in grace, with the fragrance of heaven's elevation and heaven's spirit in His wonderful sojourn here, was raised from the dead by the Father's glory, according to the Spirit of holiness.<a name=223:8></a> So, if we bury our brethren in the dignity of the anointing, we are assured that by that same Spirit even their mortal bodies will be quickened, and they will be raised incorruptible.<a name=223:9></a> You do not find that a man who divides the inheritance amongst the brethren wants a grand burial.<a name=223:10></a> No, there is a simplicity about a hill burial; it is the burial of a man of the hill country, a spiritual man.<a name=223:11></a> There is a wonderful affinity between these two - not simply in flesh and blood, for they were father and son, but an elevated affinity marked by an atmosphere of reciprocity and spiritual affections.<a name=223:12></a> So when he departs, it is in the hill of Phinehas that he is buried.<a name=223:13></a> What does it mean?<a name=223:14></a> That Phinehas is to continue on the holy elevation of Eleazar.<a name=223:15></a> A man who with Joshua will spend his life dividing the inheritance among the brethren, is a man who leaves a spiritual seed behind him, and things are going to be

		Now, I would like to refer for a moment to Phinehas in the book of Judges.<a name=224:4></a> Things had been getting lower and lower.<a name=224:5></a> Joshua had passed off the scene, and we know from this book that, as long as the elders who had been with Joshua survived, Israel was externally preserved.<a name=224:6></a> But the judges lose power, and they are going down hill all the time, till you come to a character that is apostate in Dan at the end of the book.<a name=224:7></a> But then we get this touch as to Phinehas (chapter 20: 27).<a name=224:8></a> You wonder what had become of him; you might think he had passed off the scene.<a name=224:9></a> He has disappeared where none of us can afford to do other than disappear.<a name=224:10></a> What a spot!<a name=224:11></a> He has disappeared into the presence of God.<a name=224:12></a> Did he not feel things?<a name=224:13></a> The very sorrows have taken him there no doubt.<a name=224:14></a> Is he intervening publicly to repair the situation as a reformer?<a name=224:15></a> No, he has retired with all the holy feelings that consoled his heart on another occasion and retained the hill amidst the general declension.<a name=224:16></a> Such is this man, and God has His answer for Israel in a crisis, when they do not deserve it, because there is a man who has secured His ear.<a name=224:17></a> There he is before the ark, an overcomer!<a name=224:18></a> One loves to think of him carrying on the best and the

		In the Chronicles he is presented as a keeper.<a name=225:7></a> The Chronicles are marked by spiritual taste and selection.<a name=225:8></a> It is assumed that Ezra wrote them very largely, or edited them considerably, but any way we have a writer of spiritual taste.<a name=225:9></a> Of course, that would apply to all Scripture, but to the Chronicles peculiarly.<a name=225:10></a> There are lovely records of mercy in the Chronicles - the sons of Korah, the sons of Pherez, and others whose histories once were dark, but who had a good finish; histories replete with the spirit of Christ, and therefore imperishable to God in His holy records, and true of the saints through all dispensations.<a name=225:11></a> So Phinehas is introduced here; the Spirit never forgets this kind of man; he represents the man who goes through, to whom God has committed Himself.<a name=225:12></a> So, he is a ruler, and what kind of ruler?<a name=225:13></a> Over doorkeepers.<a name=225:14></a> This great thought of doorkeeping, which was developed spiritually by David as

		It is a privilege which God has graciously bestowed on us, beloved brethren, in the last few days, to have been directed to the consideration of the various aspects of the covenants established on the part of God with men, whereby He indicated His desires for the introduction into the hearts and minds of His beloved people, by His Holy Spirit, of the features which were in accordance with Himself.<a name=229:1></a> In view of the references made to the Eternal God, and to Beer-sheba, as suggesting for us that the Eternal God is bringing forth eternal conditions, I felt that we might look at these various passages which bring before us that eternal day, and the proper conditions distinctive of the eternal state; so that we might be before the Eternal God, in view of His thoughts for His own purpose and love, and for His glory in relation to all the families embraced in the redemptive work of His beloved Son.<a name=229:2></a>

		Turning now to <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#24">Exodus  24</a>it will be remembered that the young men, those who, though not officially priests, were exercising priestly functions, were presenting sacrifices to God which pointed to the basis, according to God, of all that God will effect in relation to man.<a name=230:2></a> The full fruits of this will only come to us as the eternal day comes into full accomplishment.<a name=230:3></a> In the verses we read, we find set forth, typically, the characteristics of that eternal day where God Himself will be apprehended, although no man can ever see God in His essential Being, no man can ever intrude within the environment of unapproachable light, yet we must remember that He puts Himself into relation with His people, as indicated in what is said: that they saw God.<a name=230:4></a> What I want to stress is that there was under His feet as a sapphire stone, emphasising the heavenly features of brightness, fulness and value which are the foundation and basis of the conditions in which God sets Himself before His beloved people.<a name=230:5></a> So they ate and drank in His presence.<a name=230:6></a> It is a wonderful scene, as indicating for us features which are eternal.<a name=230:7></a> How wonderful for our souls to take account of such a scene, and what I wish to press upon our hearts is that the scene in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#24">Exodus  24</a>is depicted as taking place when the people of God were in the wilderness.<a name=230:8></a> That being the case it becomes a very blessed exercise for us that, as going through the wilderness scene, as belonging to the assembly in the wilderness, typically shown in that 24th

		In the book of Esther we find a very beautiful, though a humbling, picture of the conditions among God's people.<a name=233:5></a> Ahasuerus, representing the absolute authority of God, lays a tribute upon the whole land and upon the isles of the sea, indicating how God will bring all under His direct control.<a name=233:6></a> The scripture goes on to say in chapter 10, speaking of Mordecai, "All the acts of his power and of his might, and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai, to which the king advanced him" - they are all written down.<a name=233:7></a> Well, beloved brethren, do we take account of this that there are things written down in the chronicles which are available for us - all His mighty acts, all the works of His power, the declaration of His greatness - how God has unfolded for the hearts and for the minds of His people all the greatness of Christ.<a name=233:8></a> <i>He</i> has advanced Him, He has set Him there on high.<a name=233:9></a> In <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15">1 Corinthians  15</a>we read of the greatness and

		Then there is another part in this glorious picture, and that is the place Mordecai is holding in the hearts of his beloved people, and the place his beloved people hold in his heart, for Mordecai was great among the Jews.<a name=234:5></a> He held a place in the love of his people, the Jews; he was great in that position, and like Isaac, so to speak, he becomes greater and greater.<a name=234:6></a> As you and I see Christ more fully, more clearly, more blessedly, as our souls advance in the apprehension of God's thoughts of Him, and delight in those thoughts, we come to be greatly enlarged in our apprehension of His greatness, the greatness of the Lord Jesus among "the Jews".<a name=234:7></a> And then it says, "Accepted of the multitude of his brethren".<a name=234:8></a> Ah, that is another matter; not that he was merely great among his beloved people, but he was accepted of the multitude of his brethren; that is, there was not another who could by any possibility dispute the place he filled in the affections of those who were near and dear to his heart.<a name=234:9></a> All this suggests how Christ is accepted of the multitude of His brethren.<a name=234:10></a> So we carry in our hearts a Person, beloved brethren, and if that blessed Person is carried in our hearts as we move through this scene anticipating the glories of that coming day, how, in that

		I have in mind, beloved brethren, to speak of some of the features of the last days; having before me that we should not merely avoid the unsavoury features which are delineated in such detail in the holy Scriptures, but that we should avoid them feelingly, feeling about them as God does, and as Christ does; and then also that we should take account of the positive features of these last days.<a name=237:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		No one will deny, surely, that we are in the last days.<a name=237:2></a> Conditions around, the increasing corruption in the social circles of men, the increasing darkness religiously, and the state of things politically, are in themselves evidence that we are in the last days; but there are other evidences of a positive character, as we see what corresponds with our Lord's statement: "But learn the parable from the fig-tree: When already its branch becomes tender and produces leaves, ye know that the summer is near" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#24:32">Matthew  24:32</a>).<a name=237:3></a> The increasing affections seen amongst the people of God are in themselves very powerful evidence that we stand in the last days.<a name=237:4></a> It would seem that the last days - whether of one's life, or of a period in the ways of God, or of a dispensation - are peculiarly challenging.<a name=237:5></a> They are not only challenging, but as showing forth some features that
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=238>[Page 238]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		commend themselves and are delightful to divine Persons, they become evidence that "the summer is near".<a name=238:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One would refer in passing to the last days of Isaac.<a name=238:2></a> He had had unique and marvellous opportunities; he had become exceedingly great, waxing greater and greater until he became very great.<a name=238:3></a> But his closing days were days that the Spirit of God speaks of in a most solemn way, for you remember how he said to his son Esau, "I am become old; I know not the day of my death" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#27:2">Genesis  27:2</a>), and instead of preparing for the day of his death, he requested that he might have venison.<a name=238:4></a> Indeed, the word says that he "loved Esau, because venison was to his taste" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#25:28">Genesis  25:28</a>).<a name=238:5></a> Think of Isaac, a man in his closing days, marked by blindness, having tastes which we may soberly speak of as vitiated, as longing for something from an Esau!<a name=238:6></a> For the last part of his life he was blind.<a name=238:7></a> You remember, too, how the last of the judges (in the book of Judges) was marked by blindness, Samson having his eyes put out.<a name=238:8></a> And again, the last of the kings, Zedekiah, was marked by blindness.<a name=238:9></a> Then you remember that in the post-captivity days, the priests were said to despise Jehovah's name - what a serious state is disclosed in those last days of the dispensation under law, when the priests despised Jehovah's name and men robbed God, without feeling.<a name=238:10></a> Again, it is said of Laodicea, one of the last phases of the assembly's history upon earth, that she is wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked, and knows it not - the most solemn feature of all is that she knows it not; she is indeed heartless as to Christ, and He is said to be outside the door knocking.<a name=238:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=239>[Page 239]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Over against these features, we have a Jacob, a man of whom the Spirit of God says that his eyes were dim so that he could not see.<a name=239:1></a> If his natural eyes were dim that he could not see, his spiritual sensibilities were alert.<a name=239:2></a> He was never greater in his life than at that peculiar juncture, as he worshipped on the top of his staff, and blessed both the sons of Joseph.<a name=239:3></a> He was greater in spiritual stature and power than he had ever been, for he was with God; and his eyes were closed to all things here.<a name=239:4></a> <i>He</i> made no request for venison; though his eyes were dim and set, he was marked by spiritual sensibilities and knew what was suitable to God.<a name=239:5></a> Again, as against the blindness of Samson, and the failure of the people in the days of the judges, we have a Boaz, we have the reapers, we have a Ruth, and the most marvellous activities in the days when the judges ruled.<a name=239:6></a> Over against the failure of the kings, and peculiarly in the last days of the kingdom, we have a Jeremiah.<a name=239:7></a> Thank God for men and women who feel things with God, and are like God in the last days.<a name=239:8></a> Jeremiah was a man of intense feeling; he was a weeper, and his weeping was but the external evidence of the deepest internal emotion.<a name=239:9></a> Again, we have an Ezekiel, one who saw visions of God, one who could tell much about the glory, the remarkable feature about Ezekiel being this, that he always knew the whereabouts of divine glory.<a name=239:10></a> Again, in contrast to the failure of the priests and Levites, and the common persons in the main, we have this remarkably sweet passage: "Then they that feared Jehovah spoke often one to another; and Jehovah observed it, and heard" (<a href="../bible/Malachi.htm#3:16">Malachi  3:16</a>).<a name=239:11></a> I believe that corresponds to these last days: "Then they that feared Jehovah spoke often one to
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=240>[Page 240]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		another".<a name=240:1></a> If I understood that, would I ever say that there were too many meetings?<a name=240:2></a> If I understood the precious volume of the Lord's speaking to us in the last days, would I ever complain that there is too much ministry - either orally or written?<a name=240:3></a> Never: "They that feared Jehovah spoke often one to another; and Jehovah observed it, and heard".<a name=240:4></a> Then, over against the heartlessness, the blindness and wretchedness of Laodicea we have the precious features of Philadelphia.<a name=240:5></a> These things stand in sharp contrast; for if Laodicea is heartless, if she has need of nothing, not even of Christ - for that is the inference - Philadelphia has a little strength; she has kept His word and not denied His name, and moreover she has an opened door.<a name=240:6></a> I believe we have that in these last days, an opened door, and the Lord has promised that if He opens, no one shall shut.<a name=240:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Hence my desire and exercise is that we should take account of the features that mark these last days.<a name=240:8></a> Paul speaks of them, and in the first scripture that I read we have a long list of the most sordid things which characterise men in the last days.<a name=240:9></a> "Difficult times", indeed, but, thank God, not too difficult to go on as "lovers of God".<a name=240:10></a> I believe sometimes we read Scripture too quickly.<a name=240:11></a> This list in <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#3">2 Timothy  3</a>is a list which ought to be read slowly and carefully and with deep feeling, for it represents a state of things we have to meet and pass through, and we need great strength and grace for it.<a name=240:12></a> We need to be much with God if we are to pass through such a scene for His pleasure.<a name=240:13></a> Men are said to be "lovers of self" - that is the first thing, for above everything else a man will be a lover of himself - lovers of money, lovers of pleasure, three things which
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=241>[Page 241]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		abound in these last days.<a name=241:1></a> There are other things stated in this solemn list which remind us of <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#1">Romans  1</a>, where all the depravity of the human heart is depicted in such graphic language by the Spirit of God.<a name=241:2></a> If the list is not the same in actual detail, it is the same morally, and with this terrible added feature, that with all the sordid things men do, they have a "form of piety".<a name=241:3></a> It is cloaked over with the profession of Christianity; many of these vile things, coming from the pit, clothe themselves with the very name of Christ - a thing we ought to feel.<a name=241:4></a> But over against that list, we have this remarkable expression, "lovers of God".<a name=241:5></a> I believe if the features of which I have spoken abound in these last days, there are also, thank God, features which belong to those who are described by this exquisite designation, "lovers of God".<a name=241:6></a> I covet, beloved brethren, to see the number of the lovers of God increased in these last days, not merely persons whom God loves, but persons who love God.<a name=241:7></a> In <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:28">Romans  8:28</a> we read, "All things work together for good to those who love God".<a name=241:8></a> I believe that is the line upon which we should encourage one another, and upon which we should encourage believers in the systems of men with whom we come in contact, that the features belonging to lovers of God should be found multiplying and greatly increasing, in these last moments before our Lord Jesus returns.<a name=241:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I desire to refer to three special features which should mark "lovers of God", and for these I turn to the beloved apostles Peter, Paul, and John.<a name=241:10></a> I am aware that I am saying nothing new or novel.<a name=241:11></a> Were I addressing a company of Athenians I should have to strive to say something new, for
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=242>[Page 242]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		you remember that they "spent their time in nothing else than to tell and to hear the news" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#17:21">Acts  17:21</a>).<a name=242:1></a> Let us guard against that.<a name=242:2></a> But I have the happy precedent set up by the apostle Peter in striving to put you in mind of things that you already know.<a name=242:3></a> Four times in his second epistle he speaks of "putting you in remembrance", or similar language, and once he says, "I will be careful to put you always in mind of these things, although knowing them" (chapter 1: 12).<a name=242:4></a> We need to have our affections stirred, our pure minds stirred, and Peter, the aged apostle, speaks in the most tender way possible, almost apologetically, in addressing the true believers of his day, desiring that after his departure these things should be always in their remembrance.<a name=242:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first feature that Peter would impress upon the lovers of God stands in relation to their walk, for in the last days we shall be tested as to how we walk.<a name=242:6></a> His first word, after telling us that "the end of all things is drawn nigh", is that we should be sober.<a name=242:7></a> That surely becomes a lover of God.<a name=242:8></a> There is great need for sobriety in these last days.<a name=242:9></a> Then he says, "Be watchful unto prayers".<a name=242:10></a> I believe as we pray more, as we persevere in prayer, as it says in Colossians, and give ourselves to it, we shall be saved and preserved from the unholy features which are found in the last days.<a name=242:11></a> Then Peter says, "Having fervent love among yourselves".<a name=242:12></a> That surely is a most precious feature of the lovers of God.<a name=242:13></a> Think of a Theophilus, a man, not only loved by God, as his name indicates, but a true lover of God.<a name=242:14></a> "Having fervent love among yourselves".<a name=242:15></a> Let us examine our own hearts; let us challenge our motives; let
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=243>[Page 243]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		our minds go back now to our several localities and see whether this feature marks us.<a name=243:1></a> Have we fervent love among ourselves?<a name=243:2></a> Then he says, "Hospitable one to another, without murmuring".<a name=243:3></a> We know that the world loves its own, and we believe that the world, in a certain sense, will care for its own, but how one loves to dwell upon the increasing hospitality amongst the people of God in these last days!<a name=243:4></a> Fathers, mothers, houses, lands, brothers, sisters, indeed a hundredfold more - that is the position in the last days.<a name=243:5></a> Thank God there is this abundant hospitality, and shown without murmuring.<a name=243:6></a> The last thing that Peter would lay upon the consciences and hearts of the lovers of God is this, that they should do all things to the glory of God: "That God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory and the might for the ages of ages".<a name=243:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But if Peter would address the lovers of God in relation to their walk, Paul would address them in relation to their service and the ministry.<a name=243:8></a> Hence we have that remarkably solemn word, "I testify before God and Christ Jesus, who is about to judge living and dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom, proclaim the word" - a valuable word to young believers - "proclaim the word", and may I say in affection, be concerned about the condition in which men are; not so much about subjects finely rounded off, but proclaim the word, for men are perishing.<a name=243:9></a> Men are in the state described in chapter 3, lovers of self, lovers of money, lovers of pleasure, rather than lovers of God: so "proclaim the word; be urgent".<a name=243:10></a> It is a time of urgency.<a name=243:11></a> I believe we ought to feel that; we must waste no time.<a name=243:12></a> Hence one is
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=244>[Page 244]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		comforted and greatly encouraged by the increasing number of gospel preachings among us.<a name=244:1></a> But we need more than that: we need the personal touch; we need the compulsion of grace, so that we might get into touch with men privately and individually.<a name=244:2></a> "Be urgent in season and out of season".<a name=244:3></a> Then he says, "Fill up the full measure of thy ministry", a word which should challenge and yet encourage every one who seeks to serve.<a name=244:4></a> One feels in regard of oneself how inherently lazy one may be, and I believe with many of us there is great need for the word to Archippus, "Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, to the end that thou fulfil it" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#4:17">Colossians  4:17</a>).<a name=244:5></a> "Fill up the full measure of thy ministry".<a name=244:6></a> Thank God for the ministers and for the ministry, but let us not slack off in the slightest degree.<a name=244:7></a> Some may say, 'You do too much', and there may be many exhortations as to the body, and it is something to reflect over that the conversations among us lie so often in relation to the body.<a name=244:8></a> I believe - and I speak soberly - that where we have one enquiry as to soul-health, we have a hundred as to the health of our bodies!<a name=244:9></a> I am not belittling the fact that the body is the Lord's, but like Epaphroditus we have to regard the work as urgent, to be urgent and fill up the full measure of our ministry, for the apostolic energy has ceased.<a name=244:10></a> Marvellous energy had the apostles - marvellous energy had the men of God a century ago, without the comfortable conditions of travelling and the rapid means of transit we enjoy.<a name=244:11></a> One marvels at what they must have passed through in their desires to serve so great a people.<a name=244:12></a> Let us then be urgent and let us not think too much of comfort; let us be concerned about the work and about the ministry.<a name=244:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=245>[Page 245]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have only one word further, and that stands in relation to John's exhortation and ministry, for I believe that John would be concerned about our affections - not now our walk, or our service, the preaching or the ministry, but our affections, a most touching matter.<a name=245:1></a> So we are reminded in the last chapter in the Bible that "The time is near.<a name=245:2></a> Let him that does unrighteously do unrighteously still; and let the filthy make himself filthy still; and let him that is righteous practise righteousness still; and he that is holy, let him be sanctified still".<a name=245:3></a> So a divine fixity is about to be established.<a name=245:4></a> Then John hears a remarkable word, "Behold, I come quickly, and my reward with me, to render to every one as his work shall be".<a name=245:5></a> Then we have: "And the Spirit and the bride say, Come".<a name=245:6></a> If there is urgency in the preaching, there is urgency in the affections of the saints: "And the Spirit and the bride say, Come".<a name=245:7></a> Nor is that all, for we are not to forget divine compassions; we are not to forget that many of our brethren (with sorrow we say it) are in the systems of men, in places where little or nothing is known of the Lord's coming.<a name=245:8></a> Hence we have that word: "And let him that hears say, Come", a word to believers who need stirring up in this matter of bridal affections for Christ.<a name=245:9></a> Then, in the compassions which are marking us as preaching the word and being urgent in season and out of season, we have again, "He that will, let him take the water of life freely".<a name=245:10></a> Thank God for that!<a name=245:11></a> It is as if to the very last moment of our stay here on earth we are to be charged with divine compassions and the sense of the divine hunger after men.<a name=245:12></a> Then we have this word, "Yea, I come quickly", and the exceedingly precious response from the hearts

		characterised by incorruptible affections for Christ is, "Amen; come, Lord Jesus".<a name=246:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We were motoring some few months ago from the south of England to the north, and ran into a dense fog which became so trying that we were inclined to give up, and just as we were about to do so, a lad of about nine years of age cried out and said, 'Keep going, sir, the sun is shining at the top of the hill!<a name=246:2></a>' That is the word, dear brethren, we are to keep going.<a name=246:3></a> Whatever the last days may be characterised by, in the evil disposition and depravity of the human heart, we are to keep going.<a name=246:4></a> Not only is the sun shining in John's ministry, but we should seek that pure atmosphere in the elevation that John speaks of: "Come up here" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#4:1">Revelation  4:1</a>), then we shall pass through the murky fogs of earth, through all that is transpiring in this present evil world, having this unique and blessed feature - this blessed hope in our hearts, which Peter says is, "until the day dawn and the morning star arise in your hearts" (<a href="../bible/2Peter.htm#1:19">2 Peter  1:19</a>).<a name=246:5></a> The One for whom we look has told us that He Himself is "the bright and morning star" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:16">Revelation  22:16</a>).<a name=246:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		May the Lord greatly help us, so that in our walk, and in our service and ministry, and in our affections, we may set forth the features that belong to the lovers of God in these last days.<a name=246:7></a> There is every reason why we should love God.<a name=246:8></a> He has appeared to us at the time of our direst need: "For we being still without strength, in the due time Christ has died for the ungodly" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:6">Romans  5:6</a>).<a name=246:9></a> And again, "God commends <i>his</i> love to us, in that, we being still sinners, Christ has died for us" (verse 8).<a name=246:10></a> And yet again, even more blessed, "The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by

	<div class="paragraph">
		the Holy Spirit which has been given to us" (verse 5).<a name=247:1></a> We have every reason to be lovers of God, and may the features that belong to such be a remarkable and striking offset to the sordid, unholy, sinful features which mark the last days, for His name's sake.<a name=247:2></a>

		I desire to say a few words on the subject of glory, not that one could compass it, but to bring some thoughts before you which I trust may be for profit.<a name=249:1></a> In view of the present condition of things, surrounded as we are by various adverse circumstances, sufferings and sorrows, and the like, we may forget that we are connected with a vast system of glory, and it gives great elevation to the spirit when we catch sight of this system.<a name=249:2></a> The references to it in various forms in the Scriptures are many, and one can only just select a few that may illustrate and enforce what I have to say.<a name=249:3></a> In view of the present state of things, I feel there is great need of a present view of glory as well as the hope of glory.<a name=249:4></a> The Christian has both a present view and he also rejoices in hope of future glory.<a name=249:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The thought of the glory of God in some form or another appears very early in Scripture, and I may say that one of the main thoughts in regard of the term is that it may be described as the shining out of what is characteristic of a person, a condition, or a thing.<a name=249:6></a> What is characteristic - generally, of course, in excellence, but sometimes the opposite - is the glory of the thing, and so we find this thought confirmed in the scriptures I have read.<a name=249:7></a> Now, though we are brought to see special aspects of it in

		<a name=250>[Page 250]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Christianity, we may also gather up in our experience and see all the aspects in which this subject is presented in Scripture.<a name=250:1></a> For instance, "The heavens declare the glory of God" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#19:1">Psalm  19:1</a>).<a name=250:2></a> That is, all the attributes of God in connection with order and light are exemplified in the heavens, and they declare the glory of God to anybody who can see them.<a name=250:3></a> All those special characteristics of God come out in the movement and the light of the heavenly bodies.<a name=250:4></a> Because we have further light, it does not mean that we should not consider this question.<a name=250:5></a> I think those who compose the assembly should observe, better than others, the glory of God in creation, and more especially in the heavens.<a name=250:6></a> In regard of the earth, of course, the glory of God still appears in the creation, but there is so much that has obscured it, yet not only do we know that the knowledge of God will fill the earth as the waters cover the sea, (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#11:9">Isaiah  11:9</a>), but we learn from <a href="../bible/Habakkuk.htm#2:14">Habakkuk  2:14</a> that "the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah as the waters cover the sea".<a name=250:7></a> So that, though we know that now "the whole creation groans together and travails in pain together" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:22">Romans  8:22</a>), we recognise that not only will the physical universe be blessed, but the moral universe of men will have the knowledge of God and the knowledge of the glory of God.<a name=250:8></a> That is, men will know what is characteristic of God, and I may say that the greatest glory of man on earth is to know God.<a name=250:9></a> You could not have a greater glory or distinction attached to man than the knowledge of God.<a name=250:10></a> In fact, Jeremiah tells us so; he says, "But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me" (chapter 9: 24).<a name=250:11></a> God takes the spirit of man and so forms and

		In Exodus we learn that Moses desired to see God's glory, but he could not see God's face, he could only see the back parts, but in the declaration that was made to him, the glory of God came out morally.<a name=251:2></a> In connection with that I would say that the greatest glory is what we perceive spiritually.<a name=251:3></a> No doubt there is in certain cases the accompaniment of an outward public sign of glory, as for instance when Moses' face shone, or when the face of the blessed Lord shone as the sun, and His <i>shining</i> garments were white and effulgent.<a name=251:4></a> Though there is thus sometimes recorded a physical shining forth that accompanies a manifestation of the glory of God, as impressing our mortal vision, yet the greatest glory is the spiritual or moral, as, in this passage, the declaration of what God is in His attributes.<a name=251:5></a> In this wonderful passage, <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#34">Exodus  34</a>, you get the glory of God declared, as far as then revealed; that is, His essential characteristic attributes in regard to the revelation which He then made.<a name=251:6></a> In regard to that, it seems remarkable that the first thing said is, "Jehovah, Jehovah God merciful and gracious".<a name=251:7></a> Other qualities are mentioned but He begins with that, no doubt in view of the condition of the people; God insists that His great glory is that He is merciful and gracious.<a name=251:8></a> It does say that He will not clear the guilty, which is surely right, for no one would believe in a God who would ignore sin; no one would respect or reverence Him, and it says that retribution follows to the third and fourth generation, but in describing the other side,

		to heaven, that great weight of suffering, we know perfectly well, has a compensating glory, and not only a compensating glory because of those sufferings, but a glory even beyond the sufferings.<a name=254:1></a> Paul speaks of the sufferings working "an eternal weight of glory" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#4:17">2 Corinthians  4:17</a>).<a name=254:2></a> The sufferings actually work a weight of glory; that is, each suffering is rewarded by a partaking of glory in greater or lesser degree.<a name=254:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		That is one thing, but beside that, there is an admission in spirit to a vast scene of glory which is not necessarily connected with the reward of suffering, and that is most comforting.<a name=254:4></a> When we think of the present state of things in the world there is so much which would depress, but while we suffer in those things, there is always the sense that there is this glory system which is soon to burst upon our vision.<a name=254:5></a> It is not only most consoling, but elevating to know that just beyond us, so to speak, the next step may bring us into the manifestation of this glory, a glory to which morally we can become accustomed even now.<a name=254:6></a> So, too, in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:18">Romans  8:18</a> we have that "the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the coming glory to be revealed to us".<a name=254:7></a> If you have your eyes on that, I am perfectly certain that the sufferings are not worthy to be compared - they are small compared with that glory which shall be revealed to us, when the manifestation of the sons of God takes place.<a name=254:8></a> The glory of the children of God issues in the fulness of sonship and that which is connected with it.<a name=254:9></a>

		I am confident, beloved brethren, that we can be assured that the end of the present dispensation will not be inferior, in a spiritual sense, to the beginning.<a name=279:1></a> It is evident that the beginning and the end of what is of God always correspond.<a name=279:2></a> He Himself is said to be the "beginning and the end" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21:6">Revelation  21:6</a>), a thought that could not, of course, allow for any deterioration.<a name=279:3></a> The Lord Jesus says, of Himself, "<i>I</i> am .<a name=279:4></a>.<a name=279:5></a>.<a name=279:6></a> the beginning and the end" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#22:13">Revelation  22:13</a>) and He is "the same yesterday, and today, and to the ages to come" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#13:8">Hebrews  13:8</a>).<a name=279:7></a> The work of God always secures a blessed end.<a name=279:8></a> The work of the Spirit of God here in the saints will have a magnificent end spiritually; though the day be dark publicly, yet the closing period is going to be wonderful according to God.<a name=279:9></a>

		We see that in Jacob, who I believe is a figure of the work of the Spirit.<a name=279:10></a> He stands as representative of the work of the Spirit of God, and it says of him, "By faith Jacob when dying blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshipped" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#11:21">Hebrews  11:21</a>).<a name=279:11></a> Can we conceive a more wonderful setting to the life of Jacob, for when he was dying he was intelligent as to the man that should be first.<a name=279:12></a> He acted wittingly; he put the second man, Ephraim, before Manasseh deliberately.<a name=279:13></a> One of the great ends of the work of the Spirit in our hearts is to secure that the second Man

		How beautifully the Lord Jesus illustrates what we have been saying.<a name=280:7></a> The beginning of His pathway here was marked by the acclamation of the heavenly hosts, praising God and saying, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good pleasure in men" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:14">Luke  2:14</a>).<a name=280:8></a> Then, in the closing scene ere He vanished out of their sight, it is said that they worshipped Him.<a name=280:9></a> His coming in was marked by the acclamation of the heavenly host; His going out was marked by the worship of His own.<a name=280:10></a> So that seems to me to be in keeping with what God does.<a name=280:11></a> How frequently we find in the precious Scriptures that at the end of a section or a book we are brought to a doxology.<a name=280:12></a> Think of the books of the Psalms - each one of them closes with worship.<a name=280:13></a> Whatever may have been the experiences, many inexpressibly painful, each closes with a doxology in which, on one occasion at least, the psalmist calls on all the people of God to say Amen: "Let all the people say, Amen!<a name=280:14></a>" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#106:48">Psalm  106:48</a>).<a name=280:15></a> The Spirit of God is active to bring us consciously into that Amen.<a name=280:16></a> Even the closing scene of Nebuchadnezzar's life is like that.<a name=280:17></a> What a man he had been, but how wondrous the end; he disappears from view as a worshipper.<a name=280:18></a> He says, "Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul speaks of the Creator, so infinitely great, and there is a doxology which is not simply a statement of what is true, but is the worship of Paul's own heart.<a name=281:6></a> He says, "Who is blessed for ever.<a name=281:7></a> Amen" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#1:25">Romans  1:25</a>).<a name=281:8></a> Let us be in that Amen always; let our hearts never be silent as to the blessedness and greatness of God, the Creator.<a name=281:9></a> Then, when He speaks of the Lord Jesus Christ personally, he says, "come of David's seed according to flesh" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#1:3">Romans  1:3</a>), and there rises in the apostle's soul a vision of the inexpressible greatness of Christ, as to who He is, and he says later, "who is over all, God blessed for ever.<a name=281:10></a> Amen" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#9:5">Romans  9:5</a>).<a name=281:11></a> What a theme to awaken the worship of our hearts: "Jesus Christ .<a name=281:12></a>.<a name=281:13></a>.<a name=281:14></a> come of David's seed according to flesh" - not only that He was, but that He is over all, God.<a name=281:15></a> Though in glorious manhood, it says that He is over all, that is, over the whole universe, not confined in any way to one section, but over all; that blessed One whom we know in manhood is "over all, God blessed for ever.<a name=281:16></a> Amen".<a name=281:17></a> We are to have part in that Amen; God is helping the saints to say it.<a name=281:18></a> Then

		I want to touch a little now on this profoundly encouraging epistle of Jude.<a name=282:11></a> It was specially written for our day.<a name=282:12></a> The greater part of the epistle presents an awful picture, yea, more than a picture, a reality plainly evident before the eyes of anyone who can see according to God.<a name=282:13></a> He fain would have spoken of Christ personally, or as he said, written of "our common salvation", but conditions were already developing that caused him to write otherwise.<a name=282:14></a> He saw men already creeping unawares into that which

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then he also refers to Sodom and Gomorrha.<a name=283:13></a> He saw the features of Sodom reappearing, the spiritual Sodom as well as the carnal one - both evident even in Jude's day.<a name=283:14></a> The Scripture speaks of a place that is "spiritually Sodom" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#11:8">Revelation  11:8</a>).<a name=283:15></a> Think of the awful spiritual corruption that has developed!<a name=283:16></a> Then he tells us something that is terribly true of men and women today, that even in that which they

	<div class="paragraph">
		I must not refer more to that side, but how dark it is!<a name=284:7></a> It is the setting in which Jude closes his epistle, the darkness of Egypt coming into the professing church.<a name=284:8></a> But then he says, "But <i>ye</i>, beloved".<a name=284:9></a> Thank God for the difference, in contrast to what he has been presenting.<a name=284:10></a> Let every one of us, the dear young brothers and sisters and children, stand by that "But".<a name=284:11></a> Never allow the distance between the world - be it the religious world or the social world - and what is proper to the believer to be reduced by a hair's breadth.<a name=284:12></a> "But <i>ye</i>, beloved".<a name=284:13></a> Jude saw living affections operating in the hearts of the saints; what a blessed, holy thing, recovered and maintained in the face of the darkness and the hatred that abounds!<a name=284:14></a> "But <i>ye</i>, beloved, building yourselves up".<a name=284:15></a> How blessed is the development of what is mutual; the self-building up of the body in love, what is provided by each member contributing a living part.<a name=284:16></a> Think of a local gathering, say of fifty saints, brothers and sisters, old and young, every one contributing a living part!<a name=284:17></a> Jude says, 'That is still here'.<a name=284:18></a> "Building yourselves up on your

		Then, finally, he begins a note of worship; he closes his solemn epistle with worship.<a name=285:2></a> The dark scene that he has portrayed has not removed from his heart what God is maintaining to the end: that which is precious to Him and responsive to Him; that indeed, which considers for Him and His desires.<a name=285:3></a> Think of God having desires!<a name=285:4></a> Think of our holy privilege in responding to them!<a name=285:5></a> As to Himself, as Paul says, God is not "served by men's hands as needing something" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#17:25">Acts  17:25</a>).<a name=285:6></a> There is a sense, of course, in which He is wholly sufficient in Himself; it must be so, and yet He has desires.<a name=285:7></a> What does He desire?<a name=285:8></a> "Thou shalt do homage to the Lord thy God, and him alone shalt thou serve" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#4:10">Matthew  4:10</a>).<a name=285:9></a> He desires worship, and He desires worshippers.<a name=285:10></a> You cannot separate the worshippers from the worship according to God.<a name=285:11></a> That is what is attempted, alas!<a name=285:12></a> Much is made of formal worship in christendom, the music, the mere words, the vestments - all these things have a great place as part of the worship that men have established.<a name=285:13></a> But what God is seeking, and what He would measure, is not the worship but the worshippers.<a name=285:14></a> Let us put His standard alongside the worshippers, and what have we?<a name=285:15></a>

		Jude in closing his epistle with a doxology says, "But to him that is able to keep you without stumbling", who is able to see the saints through, whatever may be without.<a name=285:16></a> He is able to do it, Jude says, and he worships Him as the One who is able to do it "and to set you with exultation blameless before his glory".<a name=285:17></a> Jude has in his heart the

	<div class="paragraph">
		He says, "To him .<a name=286:13></a>.<a name=286:14></a>.<a name=286:15></a> be glory .<a name=286:16></a>.<a name=286:17></a>.<a name=286:18></a> from before the whole age".<a name=286:19></a> You might ask Jude what he knew of what was "before the whole age".<a name=286:20></a> How did he come to have an apprehension of God in that relation, that he could worship Him in regard to it?<a name=286:21></a> He says, "To him .<a name=286:22></a>.<a name=286:23></a>.<a name=286:24></a> be glory;" that is, there is present in Jude's soul a sense of worship to God in relation to what was from "before the whole age".<a name=286:25></a> Think of the vastness of such a thought in his heart!<a name=286:26></a> It refers to his apprehension of God as beyond the period of time.<a name=286:27></a> He thought of God in that way, as the One that inhabited eternity, before time existed!<a name=286:28></a> The sense of the greatness of God thus in the soul of Jude leads him to worship the "eternal God".<a name=286:29></a> How little we know or are able to say as to that, but we know that unapproachable light was there, that love was there, and glory was there, before the world was.<a name=286:30></a> As Jude thought thus of God in all His inscrutable

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then I am sure that Jude had attended to the words of the apostles.<a name=287:8></a> He speaks of "the words spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ".<a name=287:9></a> He adhered to them, and his soul was filled with worship in relation to what was purposed from "before the whole age;" the eternal thoughts and purpose of God before time, before the world, in relation to us.<a name=287:10></a> That also would fill his soul.<a name=287:11></a> One cannot speak much of it, but Peter touches one theme.<a name=287:12></a> He says, "knowing that ye have been redeemed, not by corruptible things, as silver or gold, .<a name=287:13></a>.<a name=287:14></a>.<a name=287:15></a> but by precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot, the blood of Christ, foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#1:18">1 Peter  1:18</a> - 20).<a name=287:16></a> Peter lays hold of that, and I have no doubt Jude had it in his heart, that the One through whom we are redeemed, and the means of our redemption, was in the mind of God as foreknown before the foundation of the world.<a name=287:17></a> The natural mind would inquire why God should permit a condition of things that would need redemption, but it is not permissible for the thing formed to question what is done by the One who formed it; for the clay to question the Potter.<a name=287:18></a> It says of the One who is the Redeemer that He was "foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world".<a name=287:19></a> I am sure Jude would have that in his heart when he says, "To him .<a name=287:20></a>.<a name=287:21></a>.<a name=287:22></a> be glory .<a name=287:23></a>.<a name=287:24></a>.<a name=287:25></a> from before the whole age".<a name=287:26></a>

		I desire to speak, dear brethren, of what the Lord is, and is ready to be, to His people as they cherish the thoughts of God in regard of the assembly.<a name=293:1></a> God intends that that which was set up at the outset by the work of the apostles should find a counterpart, at least in moral features and quality, in the last days, and I believe the Lord intends that we should have this definitely before us, as the end to which the Spirit of God is now working.<a name=293:2></a> The book of Revelation helps greatly in that connection, and in chapters 2 and 3 it shows us the history of the assembly in its public character, in its departure from the divine thought at the outset, but it also brings in light as to recovery, and closes with evidence of that recovery secured.<a name=293:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now if divine thoughts are to be realised among the saints, they are realised by virtue of the presence of overcomers.<a name=293:4></a> It is of the utmost importance to lay hold of the thought of an overcomer.<a name=293:5></a> I understand that an overcomer is one who, in the presence of general departure from the truth, refuses to lower the standard or to give up divine thoughts.<a name=293:6></a> The history of Scripture shows us that, not alone as regards the assembly, but all down the ages, the truth of God has been carried through on the principle of an

		overcomer, or overcomers, coming into evidence.<a name=294:1></a> Indeed, one might say that the book of Revelation, and in fact the whole of John's ministry - this book, his gospel, and his epistles - has in view, among other things, the formation and testimony of overcomers.<a name=294:2></a> All through chapters 2 and 3 of Revelation there is a constant word to the overcomer.<a name=294:3></a> In the addresses to the first three assemblies, the word to the overcomer follows the injunction, "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies", but in the last four the word to the overcomer precedes the injunction, suggesting that it is only the overcomer who actually pays attention to the Spirit's voice to the assemblies.<a name=294:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The importance of this address to Ephesus, in its application to us, is that it shows the <i>beginning</i> of departure, which consisted in the leaving of first love.<a name=294:5></a> That is to say, that while what was proper to the assembly was continued so far as outward appearance was concerned, the Lord detected that the spring of it in undivided affection for Himself and appreciation of Himself had gone; it had been surrendered.<a name=294:6></a> To the overcomer there the Lord says, "I will give to him to eat of the tree of life which is in the paradise of God".<a name=294:7></a> We know that the tree of life is said to bring forth twelve fruits, in each month yielding fruit.<a name=294:8></a> It speaks of Jesus as the One who, in every changing circumstance, continually presented under the eye of God some fresh feature of fruitfulness for the pleasure of God, life showing itself in ever-varied features which each succeeding circumstance brought to light in the life of Jesus.<a name=294:9></a> He is not now down here; He is above, as it says, "The tree of life which is in the paradise of God".<a name=294:10></a> It is a wonderful thought

	<div class="paragraph">
		that there is the paradise of God, a scene of divine pleasure and rest, and Jesus is the centre of it.<a name=295:1></a> He is presented here, so as to be apprehended in that light, as affording in Himself in all the features of life, the varied fruitfulness which is adequate, in its blessedness and variety, to afford rest and pleasure to the heart of God.<a name=295:2></a> He is presented as food for the one who will not allow that the assembly can afford to go on as divorced in thought and affection from Him who is her Head.<a name=295:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The gospels afford us much instruction as to this as we take account of the varied features of fruitfulness coming to light in Jesus for the pleasure of God.<a name=295:4></a> As I said, He is not now here, but, as our hymn expressed it:

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And not only to resurrection ground, but where He is, "the tree of life which is in the paradise of God".<a name=295:10></a> Every feature of the all-varied fruitfulness which delighted the heart of God is there carried through, and is to be apprehended and fed upon in the power of the Spirit.<a name=295:11></a> I think as we contemplate Christ as He is presented in the gospels, and especially in the gospel of Luke, we become impressed with the sense that every succeeding circumstance brought to light its own feature of fruitfulness for the pleasure of God.<a name=295:12></a> The tree was always yielding its fruit, so to speak, month by month.<a name=295:13></a> If we think of the introduction of Jesus into this world, there was a Babe wrapped in swaddling-clothes, lying in a manger, and immediately the angel had

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, if we trace the growing up of Jesus, as it says, advancing "in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and men" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:52">Luke  2:52</a>), we find Him, as Luke records, at the age of twelve, and He presents there these features of fruitfulness.<a name=296:4></a> Not that the others had lapsed by any means, but there at that age He presents features of fruitfulness suitable to that particular phase.<a name=296:5></a> There is on the one hand His Father's business cherished in His heart, and there is the sitting in the temple among the teachers hearing them and asking them questions - all that is suitable to that phase of His holy life here presented under the eye of God - and, coupled with that, there was the most complete subjection to the position which God had ordered for Him, so that it says He went down with His parents to Nazareth and was subject to them.<a name=296:6></a> Not that there had ever been any trace of insubjection, but the Spirit of God loves to bring before us that combination of fruitfulness at that stage, the combination of intelligent delight in His Father's business with the most perfect subjection to God's ordering for Him as set out in His circumstances at Nazareth.<a name=296:7></a>

		Then we hear but little more of the detail of the life of Jesus for eighteen years, but we may be sure that those years, characterised by patient continuance in those features that marked Him at the age of twelve, were delightful to the heart of God.<a name=297:1></a> We get an impression of that delight when, at the conclusion of those eighteen years, the heaven was opened upon Him, and the Father's voice was heard saying, "<i>Thou</i> art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#3:22">Luke  3:22</a>).<a name=297:2></a> Up to that moment there had not been any movement in public service.<a name=297:3></a> Think of the importance of this principle of subjection to the ordering of God for us, while cherishing the will of God, and of continuing in it until the moment comes to move out in service; think of the importance of those eighteen years of which we have no detail, save that we understand by the Spirit that they were filled up with the most complete obedience and subjection to the will of God in the humble circumstances appointed for Him, while at the same time He was cherishing in His heart the carrying through, to its completion, of His Father's business!<a name=297:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Luke's presentation of Christ shows Him as continually marked by the attitude and spirit of prayer, but in His praying there is no formality, no sameness.<a name=297:5></a> On one occasion we read that He withdrew into a desert place and prayed; on another He went up into a mountain to pray, as if different circumstances brought to light different features of intelligent movement which were delightful to the heart of God.<a name=297:6></a> It is for us to discern why on one occasion He went into the wilderness to pray, whereas on another He would go up into a mountain, but all I am drawing attention to is

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So we may move on, and, as I said, the gospels afford contemplation for our hearts.<a name=298:2></a> We think of the scene in Gethsemane, a holy scene indeed; each writer that records it contributes some feature that marked that occasion.<a name=298:3></a> Luke tells us that He <i>knelt</i> down, and "being in conflict he prayed more intently" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22:44">Luke  22:44</a>).<a name=298:4></a> Matthew tells us that He prayed, saying, "My Father, if it be possible let this cup pass from me; but not as <i>I</i> will, but as <i>thou</i> wilt" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#26:39">Matthew  26:39</a>).<a name=298:5></a> That is to say, there was a holy shrinking from all that the will of God would involve for Him, and the liberty to ask that, if it were possible, the cup might pass from Him, but "not as <i>I</i> will, but as <i>thou</i> wilt".<a name=298:6></a> Then Matthew again records that on the second occasion He prayed, saying, "My Father, if this cannot pass from me unless I drink it, thy will be done" (verse 42).<a name=298:7></a> Each prayer brings into evidence some fresh precious feature under the eye of God, the holy shrinking from what was involved, the liberty to pray that, if it were possible, it might be removed, but with the most complete desire that no will but God's should have place.<a name=298:8></a> And then, on the other hand, may I say reverently, the arriving at the point that there was no way out save His drinking the cup, and, arriving at it, He says, "Thy will be done".<a name=298:9></a> We may well understand that there was infinite pleasure for God in all those movements and expressions of Jesus.<a name=298:10></a> Then Mark records further that He said, "Abba, Father" (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#14:36">Mark  14:36</a>), that holy expression of confident and dependent affection, so delightful to the Father's ear,

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One would allude to one more incident.<a name=299:2></a> According to Luke's gospel, as Jesus was taken by His enemies, His misguided disciple struck off the ear of the servant of the high priest, and at that moment Jesus said, "Suffer thus far" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22:51">Luke  22:51</a>) and He touched his ear and healed him.<a name=299:3></a> Think of such a circumstance bringing to light such a movement of love on the part of Jesus, that He would not allow that the grace of God toward men should be misrepresented in any way.<a name=299:4></a> He would rather suffer whatever happened in order that God might be rightly represented before men.<a name=299:5></a> I think I have said enough to indicate that as we feed on the "tree of life which is in the paradise of God", we become imbued with a sense of the moral excellence that resides in Jesus, and the effect of it is that He becomes practically held as Head in the affections of the saints.<a name=299:6></a> I believe that is the effect of it, that the Lord rises more and more in the spiritual esteem of His people, so that they recognise Him as the One in whom every moral excellence resides, and it becomes their desire to come under His influence alone.<a name=299:7></a> It is only in that way that the divine thoughts in regard of the assembly can be realised, whether in its service Godward or in its testimony manward.<a name=299:8></a> It can only fulfil the divine intent regarding it as it is held livingly under the personal influence of Christ.<a name=299:9></a> I believe feeding on the tree of life brings about an appreciation of the One who is in the paradise of God as great enough in His own moral excellence to afford unbounded satisfaction to the heart of God.<a name=299:10></a>

		You remember how when the tribes came to David to Hebron, they said, "Even aforetime, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel" (<a href="../bible/2Samuel.htm#5:2">2 Samuel  5:2</a>).<a name=300:1></a> That is to say, that even when another man was outwardly and positionally their head, they all discerned a moral excellence in David that completely eclipsed Saul.<a name=300:2></a> The moment came when David was actually accorded his place as head to them, but it came about as the result of their having appreciated in David an excellence that eclipsed Saul; so it is with ourselves.<a name=300:3></a> The Lord graciously recovered, a hundred years ago, the truth that the assembly has a living Head in heaven, but He is practically given His place as Head in the hearts of the saints as we become impressed with the all-varied features of moral excellence that are found alone in Jesus.<a name=300:4></a> Before I leave this subject, may I just refer to the close of John's gospel?<a name=300:5></a> I suppose it is generally believed that John's gospel was the last of the inspired writings, and, if so, it is all the more remarkable that it closes with this word: "And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which if they were written one by one, I suppose that not even the world itself would contain the books written" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#21:25">John  21:25</a>).<a name=300:6></a> It is as if the Spirit of God intends that that should rest as a final impression upon the minds and hearts of the saints, that there is an inexhaustible fulness in Jesus, and the assembly is intended to be the vessel, as having a living, adoring appreciation of Christ, in which all the varied features of life as seen in Jesus have practical expression.<a name=300:7></a> I believe all the movements of the saints, in so far as they are the result of their being in living touch with Christ, become the

		I refer now to the assembly at Pergamos, as it represents the phase in the history of the assembly in which worldliness began to come in, and hence what is presented to the overcomer is that which is calculated to counteract that element.<a name=301:3></a> I am sure, if we think it over, we would not desire that any element of worldliness should have place with us.<a name=301:4></a> We remember the words which the Lord Jesus spoke to the Father about His own, how He said, "They are not of the world, as I am not of the world" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#17:16">John  17:16</a>), and again, the prophetic word given through Balaam in regard of God's people that they should dwell alone and not be reckoned among the nations.<a name=301:5></a> In Pergamos, the feature of worldliness was coming in.<a name=301:6></a> There were those who held the doctrine of Balaam.<a name=301:7></a> They were not as yet teaching it, but they held it.<a name=301:8></a> It was a question of what was being secretly held in the heart, the idea that it was permissible and perhaps even advantageous for the saints to be friendly with the world, but that idea cannot be held if the word of God has its place with us.<a name=301:9></a> We may remind ourselves of what the Spirit of God says through James, that "friendship with the world is enmity with God" (<a href="../bible/James.htm#4:4">James  4:4</a>), and that "whoever therefore is minded to be the friend of the world is constituted enemy of God".<a name=301:10></a> We do not want to be enemies of God, beloved; we want to be among the thousands who love God.<a name=301:11></a> We need to come with the Spirit of God to a spiritual judgment of the world.<a name=301:12></a> As it is said, "The whole world lies in the wicked one" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:19">1 John  5:19</a>), and again, that

		It occurred to me that we may be profitably reminded, dear brethren, of certain features which marked Christianity at the outset, as seen in the upper room in the beginning of the Acts, not only that we may learn how to continue as Christians individually, but, as being brought into such a circle in which we each have a responsibility to move, that we may function in relation to the body as set up in the upper room.<a name=317:1></a> That is what I should like to bring before you, that the features of the upper room may be clearly understood by each of us.<a name=317:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will notice that Luke calls our attention to the Lord's instructions to His disciples.<a name=317:3></a> He sent Peter and John into the city, which in itself is a matter for our consideration.<a name=317:4></a> They were competent to prepare the passover in the upper room.<a name=317:5></a> "There make ready", was the Lord's word to them.<a name=317:6></a> But in coming to the city the first thing they see is a man, as the Lord had said, "as ye enter into the city".<a name=317:7></a> One would seek that we might take this to heart, that the first thing we look for in any city is a man carrying a pitcher of water.<a name=317:8></a> If we are to come into the upper room intelligently, we must first learn to follow that man.<a name=317:9></a> In Acts we read, "They returned to Jerusalem from the mount called the mount of Olives" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:12">Acts  1:12</a>), suggesting that what characterises this large upper room is that the Spirit
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=318>[Page 318]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		of God prevails there.<a name=318:1></a> One would emphasise this, for we all must learn it, that if the Lord is to have His rightful place amongst us, what is spiritual must prevail.<a name=318:2></a> They came to Jerusalem from the mount of Olives.<a name=318:3></a> Their souls would be bathed in the influence of that place and they would enter the upper room under that divine influence.<a name=318:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, these two disciples come into the city and follow the man with the pitcher of water to "the house where he goes in".<a name=318:5></a> Then they were to say to the master of the house, "The Teacher says to thee, Where is the guest-chamber?<a name=318:6></a>" This suggests to me that as coming into the upper room, we must learn that the Lord Jesus Christ as the Teacher has a right to the upper room.<a name=318:7></a> He is the Teacher and the Lord, and in coming into that room we must learn that we are there, not to do as we please, but as guests.<a name=318:8></a> As consciously there we are to follow the lead and instruction of the Teacher.<a name=318:9></a> Then Luke tells us that "when the hour was come, he placed himself at table, and the twelve apostles with him".<a name=318:10></a> They were <i>with</i> Him; all were present; not one was missing!<a name=318:11></a> All sat down together; none were late.<a name=318:12></a> This is an added feature of the upper room: that we do not disregard the Lord's rights amongst us even in the matter of attendance and punctuality.<a name=318:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the list of names in Acts begins with Peter and John and James; they <i>abode</i> in the upper room and were subject to the rights of Christ in respect to it.<a name=318:14></a> Then it says, "Peter, standing up" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:15">Acts  1:15</a>).<a name=318:15></a> I am sure there was no question in the minds of any there as to who should speak on that occasion.<a name=318:16></a> They all recognised that Peter should speak.<a name=318:17></a> Now these features were found in the upper room at

		the beginning of Christianity; there was a recognition of the rights and sovereignty of God amongst them, and we too should look for that on every occasion that we come together, otherwise we will not be continuing in what was established at the outset.<a name=319:1></a> If Peter is given place, he will see that the Lord has His place amongst us in authority, with this result, that the flesh in us will be kept in subjection.<a name=319:2></a> We will not be together as simply accumulating knowledge - precious as the ministry is - but will be making room for the authority of the Lord amongst us.<a name=319:3></a> Peter will assert that authority, so that if we do not have Peter's features amongst us, we will lack something of the furnishings set up at the beginning.<a name=319:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish to link <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22">Luke  22</a>with <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20">Acts  20</a>.<a name=319:5></a> We get the idea of the upper room in both passages.<a name=319:6></a> It says, "We being assembled to break bread, Paul discoursed to them, about to depart on the morrow.<a name=319:7></a> And he prolonged the discourse till midnight.<a name=319:8></a> And there were many lights in the upper room where we were assembled".<a name=319:9></a> Now, to continue the thought of recognising Peter, the "being assembled" contains the same idea as "with one accord" in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:46">Acts  2:46</a>.<a name=319:10></a> They were together characteristically, relatively right one with the other, and the many lights were shining brightly; "There were many lights in the upper room".<a name=319:11></a> The question might arise with a brother, is it my turn to speak tonight?<a name=319:12></a> But it is important to make room for the Spirit of God, as suggested in the earthen pitcher of water, and in the return to Jerusalem from the mount of Olives.<a name=319:13></a> They were there in the full recognition of the dignity and the features of the upper room.<a name=319:14></a> Think of that position!<a name=319:15></a> Again room is made for the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One's desire is that these holy features characterising the upper room of <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22">Luke  22</a>, the upper room of <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1">Acts  1</a>, and the upper room of <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20">Acts  20</a>, might mark us in our localities whether present for the Lord's supper, for prayer, or for reading of the Scriptures; that the Lord's rights should be asserted amongst us, whether as represented in Peter or in Paul, to the end that we continue in what was set up at the beginning.<a name=321:10></a>

		I have before me to speak about ideals, ideals that are not imaginary, but which can be realised.<a name=323:1></a> If we have no true ideals before our souls, we fall into depression, and things come between us and Christ.<a name=323:2></a> It is a sad thing to see Christians going on without any definite object or aim, lacking steadfastness in their lives.<a name=323:3></a> Let us ask ourselves, what definite object have we in our lives?<a name=323:4></a> We can go on in a careless sort of way, doing our business, not transgressing the moral code, going to meetings and enjoying them to a certain extent, nevertheless not in the realisation of what I am speaking of as Christian ideals.<a name=323:5></a> We may thus go through life with an undefined path because Christ is not before us as our object.<a name=323:6></a> I think that one of the great benefits of meetings like this is to stir us up so that we may review our motives and our object in life, that we may see where we are and be preserved from going through the short time that remains, until the Lord comes, in an aimless way.<a name=323:7></a> This is the object with which I speak.<a name=323:8></a>

		In Philippians you get a further thought, not only that Christ is subjectively in him, and that he has Christ in his heart, but that he has Christ as his object.<a name=324:12></a> He has a glorious Christ before him, and he presses towards the goal for the prize of the calling on high of God in Christ Jesus.<a name=324:13></a> I trust that we will also press on.<a name=324:14></a> He says, That is my ideal - Christ in glory, and knowing Him, being found in Him, and being conformed to His death.<a name=324:15></a> That was his ideal, and he kept to it.<a name=324:16></a> There is no one I know who kept this ideal before him so wonderfully as the apostle did from day to day, from

		Now I want to say a few words about the necessity of spiritual experiences in stabilising our own souls.<a name=338:1></a> It is not only a matter of faith, there are necessary spiritual experiences which stabilise us.<a name=338:2></a> Just to make clear what I mean, there is a passage in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8">Romans  8</a>which says, "The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit, that we are children of God" (verse 16).<a name=338:3></a> Now, if we have not had that experience, we shall not be stable.<a name=338:4></a> If we have <i>only</i> faith, there is danger, but if there is experience, and the Spirit witnessing <i>is</i> experience, then we are not easily shaken, because we have the consciousness that we are really of the divine family.<a name=338:5></a> It stabilises our minds against all doubt; it is not only resting on the letter of the word of God.<a name=338:6></a> I want to make clear that in everything connected with spiritual life there must be spiritual experience, which greatly helps to stabilise our souls, and we should all ask ourselves whether we have had this.<a name=338:7></a> Perhaps you know what they are from the Scriptures, but if you have not had the experience, you will be talking of what you do not know.<a name=338:8></a> As an example take such a thing as prayer.<a name=338:9></a> You approach God in prayer: have your prayers been answered?<a name=338:10></a> Well if they have not, you might discourse on prayer, but you do not know anything about it.<a name=338:11></a> It is a great thing to have the experience of answer to prayer.<a name=338:12></a>

		I want to speak about the movements of divine Persons.<a name=347:1></a> It is a wonderful thing that God has been pleased to take account of man, when you think of who God is in the greatness and blessedness of His being: self-contained and absolute.<a name=347:2></a> That He should have moved out to man should fill us with feelings of wonder and adoration.<a name=347:3></a> I want to trace some of the movements of divine Persons from the time the world began; that is, as They are known to us in revelation.<a name=347:4></a> Their essential Godhead we cannot know, but They have moved in various ways, and marvellously so.<a name=347:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I desire to draw your attention to this first great movement of God, when He came from what I may call the isolation of Deity into creatorial activity.<a name=347:6></a> It says, "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth".<a name=347:7></a> It was at a word!<a name=347:8></a> As the disorder and chaos came in, we read that the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters, and this extraordinary scene which we see around us was brought into being.<a name=347:9></a> God spake and it was done; so that even the material side of it is indeed wondrous.<a name=347:10></a> In it we see God's eternal power and divinity, but it was all made and framed for a purpose; and we, by faith, apprehend that the worlds were framed by the word of God: not merely were they brought into being, but they were framed - put

		together in a certain definite way according to divine purpose.<a name=348:1></a> The whole scene was one which was not to be merely material in its import, but one in which the glory of God could be seen, and where the great question of good and evil could be wrought out.<a name=348:2></a> All the material side of things that we see around us, wonderful as it is (although sin has come in and spoiled the earth), is but a platform on which God has been pleased to work.<a name=348:3></a> I cannot sufficiently impress you with the importance of the moral bearing of what God has done in coming out in creation.<a name=348:4></a> He moved out to create, and having settled the question of good and evil, to bring about eventually a scene which will be for His eternal glory.<a name=348:5></a> Let me observe here, that no being has any right to glory except God, but the nature of God is such that He could, and does, get glory for Himself.<a name=348:6></a> It is not for man to get glory for himself, it is not for the creature, however exalted.<a name=348:7></a> Satan was an exalted creature, but he sought glory himself, and he fell.<a name=348:8></a> God alone has the right to seek glory for Himself, and He is going to have it eternally.<a name=348:9></a> Everything created will be for His glory, and that is what He is working for.<a name=348:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now He has come out in these great movements, and I want to show you how, when sin came in, God continued to move.<a name=348:11></a> He moved in a wonderful way when Adam sinned.<a name=348:12></a> We read, "They heard the voice of Jehovah Elohim, walking in the garden" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#3:8">Genesis  3:8</a>).<a name=348:13></a> It was a movement toward man, a movement of inquiry.<a name=348:14></a> Why should the blessed God walk in the garden?<a name=348:15></a> Why should He move in that direction?<a name=348:16></a> Because of His intense interest in man.<a name=348:17></a> His Son was to become Man, and it was for the glory of His

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Son as well as for His own.<a name=349:1></a> Now God did not retreat into His ineffable glory when man sinned, He still continued to take interest in man.<a name=349:2></a> In the book of Genesis we find He shows great care in investigating; for example at the time of the building of the tower of Babel, it says, "Jehovah came down to see" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#11:5">Genesis  11:5</a>).<a name=349:3></a> It was a divine movement.<a name=349:4></a> And then again, in regard of Sodom, He said, "I will go down .<a name=349:5></a>.<a name=349:6></a>.<a name=349:7></a> and see" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#18:21">Genesis  18:21</a>).<a name=349:8></a> Not that He could not know from heaven of course.<a name=349:9></a> He could, but it was for our sake, to demonstrate His infinite patience and care.<a name=349:10></a> God's visits were for that purpose, put in that way in these two incidents.<a name=349:11></a> Then again He came down and visited His friend Abraham.<a name=349:12></a> He appeared to him at Mamre; it was a visit of God, not only to investigate the guilt of Sodom, but to convey to Abraham what He was about to do.<a name=349:13></a> How wonderful that God should visit man to acquaint him with His mind.<a name=349:14></a> That is what God did, and He continues to do it.<a name=349:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in the passage in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#3">Exodus  3</a>He says, "I am come down to deliver them".<a name=349:16></a> Could He not see the whole state from heaven?<a name=349:17></a> He could, but He expressed His sympathy, and came down to deliver.<a name=349:18></a> It was God's interest in man.<a name=349:19></a> I say that because the modern idea is that God is so distant, and that He takes little interest in man.<a name=349:20></a> The truth is that God, in mercy as well as in judgment, intervenes in man's affairs, and here He had come down to deliver them.<a name=349:21></a> The appearing of God to Moses in the burning bush was a powerful testimony to God's feelings toward men.<a name=349:22></a> He said to Moses, "I have seen assuredly the affliction of my people .<a name=349:23></a>.<a name=349:24></a>.<a name=349:25></a> I know their sorrows .<a name=349:26></a>.<a name=349:27></a>.<a name=349:28></a> I am come down to deliver them .<a name=349:29></a>.<a name=349:30></a>.<a name=349:31></a> and to bring them up out of that land".<a name=349:32></a>

		Now these movements I speak of were but visits - divine movements, but of that nature.<a name=350:1></a> After the formation of the tabernacle, God moved to fill it with His glory.<a name=350:2></a> So too, in the construction of the temple, God moved in a similar manner, and filled the temple with His glory.<a name=350:3></a> In <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#40">Exodus  40</a>, Moses could not go in because of the glory; and in <a href="../bible/1Kings.htm#8:11">1 Kings  8:11</a> the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud; for the glory of Jehovah had filled the house of Jehovah.<a name=350:4></a> He came to <i>dwell</i> with men; it was a divine movement of a permanent character, as we might say; He came to dwell amongst His people.<a name=350:5></a> What a wonderful thing that God should have a dwelling-place with men, bearing with their hard-heartedness and stiff-neckedness.<a name=350:6></a> In Ezekiel we read how the glory lingered over Jerusalem, slowly departing till it disappeared in the east, and the temple was left without the glory of God.<a name=350:7></a> It will return in full measure in the day to come, as Ezekiel tells us later on in his book.<a name=350:8></a> That was the wonderful consummation that God had before Him.<a name=350:9></a> He would say, 'I am not only going to visit you, but to dwell with you'.<a name=350:10></a> Marvellous movements!<a name=350:11></a> With what veneration and worship we observe what God has said He will yet do!<a name=350:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The next great movement of God of which I want to speak is the incarnation.<a name=350:13></a> That is a marvellous movement!<a name=350:14></a> A divine Person came into manhood!<a name=350:15></a> What a movement!<a name=350:16></a> "The Word became flesh, and dwelt among us".<a name=350:17></a> God Himself came down here and dwelt among men.<a name=350:18></a> That is a movement of supreme importance; there was never a more important movement of divine Persons than that.<a name=350:19></a> Things were coming to a climax; how deeply we should meditate on the truth of

		<a name=351>[Page 351]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		the incarnation, with all that it meant.<a name=351:1></a> Not that we can ever compass it; we cannot understand the mystery of it, nevertheless we can and do understand that God has been revealed here in a Man, who dwelt and lived and moved about here - every movement of that blessed Person down here filling us with the deepest interest and calling for our worship.<a name=351:2></a> One cannot now trace them in detail, but every step of His is worthy of the most intimate and delicate attention.<a name=351:3></a> There is not a word He spoke, nor an action or work He did, that is not worthy of our closest attention.<a name=351:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The gospels are so full, it will take us all our time to study them.<a name=351:5></a> I think as we grow older, we study the gospels more closely and exhaustively, not in an ordinary student's way, but in a worshipping spirit.<a name=351:6></a> Every step of the Lord as seen in them, and every incident in which He meets sinners, and speaks to His own; every step of His path demands our serious attention.<a name=351:7></a> The divine movements down here were wonderful, as He moved from the manger to the cross, every movement calls for our devout and worshipping study.<a name=351:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How can we speak of the next movement - the descent!<a name=351:9></a> He descended, but that wonderful descent is a movement in manhood.<a name=351:10></a> He descended to the cross, for all was to be founded there.<a name=351:11></a> We worship as we think of it - as we follow that divine movement!<a name=351:12></a> We cannot follow beyond a certain point.<a name=351:13></a> We can follow the details of His trial, and the steps of that last journey to the cross.<a name=351:14></a> We see His attitude towards the various elements congregated there, and can listen to the gracious words He spoke, but when the pall of darkness fell, we can follow no further; we could not

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=352>[Page 352]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		penetrate the depth of that descent, when that divine Person went into darkness, and wrath, and judgment for us.<a name=352:1></a> It serves to subdue our spirits.<a name=352:2></a> There is nothing, I believe, more powerful in subduing our spirits and bringing us into accord with His death than the contemplation of His sufferings and death.<a name=352:3></a> As we see what He went through, as far as we may, it has the deepest effect upon our hearts, and we are attracted to that blessed One and attached to Him for ever.<a name=352:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there was a moral answer to that descent, and it is put in many ways in the Scripture.<a name=352:5></a> In <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:9">Philippians  2:9</a> it says, "Wherefore also God highly exalted him, and granted him a name, that which is above every name".<a name=352:6></a> In <a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#3:1">Colossians  3:1</a> He is said to be "sitting at the right hand of God", an expression which demands our attention.<a name=352:7></a> Then in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:3">Hebrews  1:3</a> He has "set himself down on the right hand of the greatness on high" - a similar expression.<a name=352:8></a> These expressions indicate an exalted and high position, a place of favour, and a place of power.<a name=352:9></a> I take it that to be seated on the right hand of God means that it is the first place, the place of power and favour.<a name=352:10></a> He is said in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:20">Ephesians  1:20</a> to be set down at God's right hand in the heavenlies.<a name=352:11></a> There are also several other expressions in the Scriptures indicating an even higher position than that.<a name=352:12></a> In <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#4:14">Hebrews  4:14</a> it says that He "has passed through the heavens", in connection with His priesthood, and "become higher than the heavens" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#7:26">Hebrews  7:26</a>); and in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:10">Ephesians  4:10</a> has "ascended up above all the heavens".<a name=352:13></a> That is, His place of exaltation is even above what I have already mentioned, that is, it is beyond the flight of our knowledge, it is "above all the

		heavens;" for the heavens themselves, though they are described as the abode of God, are created.<a name=353:1></a> They are a created sphere, but He has gone far above them all.<a name=353:2></a> He has passed through the heavens, it does not tell us how many, but it is through them, for the word is plural; and He has gone far above all heavens.<a name=353:3></a> Think of the exaltation of this wonderful Person who came so low for us!<a name=353:4></a> He has gone into a glory beyond our comprehension, beyond all created things.<a name=353:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I want to go from that to ask this important question, What is His relation to us there?<a name=353:6></a> We have seen how He came from infinite glory down to this scene of woe, and how wonderful His descent was - is He going to leave us as having Himself ascended so high, to the very highest point?<a name=353:7></a> - beyond any creature thought?<a name=353:8></a> No, there is a divine movement from heaven; it is described in several ways, but He is not going to leave the beloved objects of His love here unvisited.<a name=353:9></a> I do not refer to the rapture, I refer to His present movements towards and amongst His own.<a name=353:10></a> You might think that having gone up far beyond our comprehension, He remains there, and that we adore Him there, and that is all we can do.<a name=353:11></a> Not at all.<a name=353:12></a> He will not leave us orphans; He says, "I am coming to you" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#14:18">John  14:18</a>).<a name=353:13></a> Coming, obviously, entails movement towards us.<a name=353:14></a> It is a movement of this wonderful Person to us.<a name=353:15></a> Of course it is spiritual, for corporeally He is in heaven.<a name=353:16></a> But there is a spiritual movement in which He comes to us - wonderful fact!<a name=353:17></a> I desire to know more of this.<a name=353:18></a> He says, "I am coming to you" - a plural word - and how we long to welcome Him when He does move in our direction.<a name=353:19></a> To be orphans means that

		There is also a divine movement in the way of life: I refer to the very remarkable passages in the writings of both Paul and John.<a name=354:14></a> Paul says, "No longer live, <i>I</i>, but Christ lives in me" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:20">Galatians  2:20</a>), and again in another connection in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:10">Romans  8:10</a>, "If Christ be in you, the body is dead on account of sin, but the Spirit life on account of righteousness".<a name=354:15></a> And even to the Corinthians, badly as they were going on, he says, "Do ye not recognise yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you?<a name=354:16></a>" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#13:5">2 Corinthians  13:5</a>) - a very remarkable expression.<a name=354:17></a> You say, 'How is that divine movement brought about?<a name=354:18></a>' Well, without attempting to analyse it I would say, it is because the Spirit is here, and if one divine Person can be here, so to speak, Another can; that is, in the power of the Spirit.<a name=354:19></a> It is because God is here,

		Before I go on to the final movement of the Lord Jesus, I want to refer to the movement of the blessed Spirit of God.<a name=355:14></a> That He moved in creation, we all know.<a name=355:15></a> He moved, too, in men of God.<a name=355:16></a> We know how the Spirit came on the judges, how the Spirit of God enabled them to do exploits; they were, in a way, visits, it was not to dwell.<a name=355:17></a> He would come down and enable them to do things or, as with David,

		to compose the most wonderful psalms, and to have the most wonderful spiritual experiences, but He was not a permanent resident, wonderful as His movements were in relation to Israel, as they will be again when the Spirit will be poured out upon them.<a name=356:1></a> What I want to direct your attention to is the divine movement at Pentecost.<a name=356:2></a> There, the materials have been carefully selected and carefully provided by the Lord Himself.<a name=356:3></a> Though the disciples did not understand all His teaching in those wonderful three and a half years, when His influence in words and works was being daily impressed upon them, nevertheless they were greatly affected by them.<a name=356:4></a> Then in the forty days, we know how greatly He instructed them.<a name=356:5></a> The Lord's teaching was most wonderful; and when all this material had been carefully selected and that which was evil - Judas - had been cast aside, then there was a wonderful company fit to receive the Holy Spirit.<a name=356:6></a> Upon the Lord Jesus, as we know, the Spirit came bodily, not as a Visitor.<a name=356:7></a> Jesus was anointed with the Holy Spirit, and He was full of the Spirit.<a name=356:8></a> He came upon Him; it was one divine Person identifying Himself with another divine Person here in manhood.<a name=356:9></a> There was no leaving Him, the Spirit came down and abode upon Him; it was a permanent residence.<a name=356:10></a> So the Spirit came down at Pentecost - marvellous divine movement.<a name=356:11></a> The whole material was welded together, so to speak, and it was like the glory coming down into the tabernacle, or into the temple.<a name=356:12></a> It was the glory of God coming down and filling the house.<a name=356:13></a> The Spirit is spoken of in that way.<a name=356:14></a> You remember Peter speaks of "the Spirit of glory" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#4:14">1 Peter  4:14</a>), so that evidently the thought of glory is connected with the Spirit,

	<div class="paragraph">
		I pass on now to the next great movement of the Lord Jesus.<a name=357:14></a> It is distinct from His continual movements.<a name=357:15></a> It is that He is coming for us.<a name=357:16></a> What a movement that will be when He descends from heaven for us!<a name=357:17></a> How can we picture the joy of that moment - the blessed joy of the rapture, when we shall meet our blessed Lord in the air, and so be for ever with the Lord?<a name=357:18></a> The heights to which He can take us, who can tell?<a name=357:19></a> It is said, we are seated in Him in the heavenlies; not merely that because He is there, we are to be there in

		the future, but we are now seated together in Him in the heavenlies; it is <i>now</i>; it is a restful position, and gives us now the joys of the present heavenly position.<a name=358:1></a> Not only does He visit us, but we are in Him <i>there</i>, and we are there because He is there, as far as cause is concerned; but we have access by the Spirit to that heavenly scene where He is.<a name=358:2></a> In fact, not only does He move towards us and visit us, but He dwells in us too, and in the Spirit moves us to that scene where He is, and that is no imagination, but a spiritual experience.<a name=358:3></a> A great many things are said to be "in Christ", and they are real, and one desires greatly to be more in the enjoyment of our heavenly position.<a name=358:4></a> It is in the power of the Spirit, but it is the love of Christ that would give us now a present entrance into what is in heaven.<a name=358:5></a> Paul says, "The Lord himself, with an assembling shout .<a name=358:6></a>.<a name=358:7></a>.<a name=358:8></a> shall descend from heaven" (<a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#4:16">1 Thessalonians  4:16</a>) - that is the next great movement; we are waiting for that.<a name=358:9></a> What a wonderful thing it would be if it were to take place now!<a name=358:10></a> We know not when He will descend.<a name=358:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now there is one other movement to which I would refer briefly, and it is found in <a href="../bible/John.htm#14:23">John  14:23</a>.<a name=358:12></a> It not only gives us the manifestation to the individual who keeps His words, but it gives us the great fact that if we keep His word "my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our abode with him".<a name=358:13></a> Notice the plural - "<i>We</i> will come to him".<a name=358:14></a> If there is obedience and subjection, We will come to him; that includes not only one divine Person, but the Father will come to us too.<a name=358:15></a> It is a remarkable statement.<a name=358:16></a> The secret of it lies in the Spirit; because the Spirit is in us, these things are possible; not only in the power of

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I pass on to the time when the visits and movements of which I have spoken are over, when God will be "all in all", when the Son shall have given over the kingdom, and shall Himself be placed in subjection; then there is perfection of rest.<a name=359:5></a> Whatever spiritual movements there may be in the eternal state, we cannot say, but it is not a time of change or movement in the sense in which we have been speaking, but it is God "all in all".<a name=359:6></a> He has come now to a final conclusion; the Son actually taking this place of subjection for ever.<a name=359:7></a> You may have thought He came and took the place of subjection for a few brief years until the eternal state.<a name=359:8></a> Not at all!<a name=359:9></a> He has taken this place of subjection for all eternity.<a name=359:10></a> The One who has been here to make His love known to us, the objects of the Father's counsel, has been pleased to remain on our side for ever.<a name=359:11></a> He never ceases to be towards us; but the Son shall be subject to Him who puts all things under Him, that God may be all in all.<a name=359:12></a> The wonderful fact remains that He takes up that position and is

	<div class="paragraph">
		Thus the whole history unfolds before us, and we see God coming out from His isolation, if I may use the expression, into His creatorial activities; and down the long stream of time moving in regard to man for His own glory; and when God is all in all, will it not be that supreme worship will be given to Him?<a name=360:3></a> Supreme appreciation of God will be there; we shall appreciate God fully, as far as He can be known as revealed.<a name=360:4></a> He will have His glory in that scene of wonderful glory and worship, and at the same time our hearts, without any let or hindrance, without any sense of distance, will enjoy the company of that blessed Person, who has made the love of God known to our hearts in time.<a name=360:5></a> How it fills one's heart with joy and thankfulness, that God should have come so near to us; and that Christ should have descended where He did, and ascended where He did, that He should be for us now and for ever!<a name=360:6></a> What a dignity it puts upon us!<a name=360:7></a> I say to the young people - Where is the world in the face of all this?<a name=360:8></a> What place does it hold in such a scheme?<a name=360:9></a> Can anything equal the prospect before us?<a name=360:10></a> There is nothing that the world can offer to a soul established in the love of God - nothing!<a name=360:11></a> As these things are being gradually worked out in our experience, God is so dealing with us as to make things more and more real and precious to our hearts.<a name=360:12></a> One prays that the Lord may use this occasion to make the Lord more precious to us, and that we may pay attention to all these divine movements and divine visitations, and have sufficient spiritual discernment to recognise them when they occur, until that

		I desire, dear brethren, to speak of the assembly of God, the masterpiece of divine wisdom, in which we have been called to have part, so as to enlist the interest of everyone, from the youngest upward, brother and sister alike, in this great thought that we belong to the assembly of God; having also in view that God's thoughts concerning it are to come into practical expression <i>now</i>.<a name=363:1></a> It is of special value to God.<a name=363:2></a> He has purchased it, as we read, "with the blood of his own" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20:28">Acts  20:28</a>).<a name=363:3></a> God esteems it thus highly, and would have us to do so also.<a name=363:4></a> <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3:15">1 Timothy  3:15</a> speaks of it as "the assembly of the living God", showing that it is that in which God is known in living affections.<a name=363:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to speak, in the first place, about that aspect of it in which it is seen as the great vessel in which God at the present time, as well as in eternity, is praised worthily of Himself, in affection and intelligence.<a name=363:6></a> Then secondly, as that in which God is expressed in His nature, that expression itself resulting in glory to God.<a name=363:7></a> The great thought of God at the present time is that the features proper to the assembly should come into expression <i>now</i>.<a name=363:8></a> I have no doubt that is what was in view in the recovery that the Lord has brought to pass during this last century, that a way should be made for the expression of the truth of the

		assembly, and this, not only in the way of teaching, although there has been the liberation of the teaching as to it - but that there should be the expression of it livingly, in those who have availed themselves of the teaching.<a name=364:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So in the address to Philadelphia which deals, as we know, with the great line of recovery which is characteristic of our day, we find the Lord says to the overcomer - the one who appreciates the opened door and avails himself of it, and continues on that line to the end - "Him will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more at all out; and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven, from my God, and my new name" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:12">Revelation  3:12</a>).<a name=364:2></a> That is to say, that things are not merely expressed in the teaching, but in <i>persons</i>, and the overcomer has all these features of the truth written upon him, so that they are seen in living expression for the pleasure and glory of God.<a name=364:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the apostle Paul in writing to the Corinthians, referring to the truth of the assembly, speaks of "that hidden wisdom", which he says "God had predetermined before the ages for our glory" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:7">1 Corinthians  2:7</a>), and he contemplates that we will glory in this great thought, that God has taken us up in His grace, with a view to connecting us with what was in His mind before the world was.<a name=364:4></a> It is therefore intended to eclipse the world for us, and to displace it in our thoughts, by substituting for it in our minds this great thought of the assembly of God.<a name=364:5></a> That will involve testing and suffering; because if God is set to attain any end, we may rest assured that Satan will oppose it.<a name=364:6></a> In

		Genesis, after we get presented the great thought of God regarding Christ and the assembly, before sin came in, we immediately get the activities of Satan to frustrate it.<a name=365:1></a> We find him bringing in a man - in Cain - who commenced a line of definite opposition to all that is of God, setting up a world which Satan intended should eclipse what God had in mind for His people; and the line of Cain continues to this day.<a name=365:2></a> Religiously it continues, and goes on to the perishing of Core; that is to say, it eventuates in the great apostasy, but there are other ways also, in which Cain and his line show themselves in murderous opposition to every feature of righteousness.<a name=365:3></a> We read in <a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:12">1 John  3:12</a>, "Not as Cain was of the wicked one, and slew his brother; and on account of what slew he him?<a name=365:4></a> because his works were wicked, and those of his brother righteous".<a name=365:5></a> The saints of God have to contend with that in the world today.<a name=365:6></a> They have to contend with the spirit of Cain in the business world, in all kinds of unions and associations through which men, energised by the spirit of Cain, seek to make it impossible for a man to live who maintains righteousness in the sight of God, and keeps himself from these unholy associations.<a name=365:7></a> The spirit of Cain shows itself, in that way, in the attempt to deprive of the means of livelihood a man who fears God and seeks to maintain righteousness.<a name=365:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, the resource of the people of God is in understanding that God intends that His thoughts should be carried through to completion, and that though they may have to suffer, they can count upon the support of the Lord in continuing on the line of righteousness, without which no thought of God will ever be realised.<a name=365:9></a> So it says, that in the

		<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#10">Romans  10</a>gives us two thoughts.<a name=366:5></a> It speaks of calling <i>on the Lord</i> (verse 12), and of calling <i>on the name</i> of the Lord (verse 13).<a name=366:6></a> Calling on the Lord is the secret thing, it is what goes on between your soul and the Lord.<a name=366:7></a> You call upon One whom you know and trust, but calling on the name of the Lord is the public thing: you are calling upon One who is not here; you call upon His name, and that becomes a testimony.<a name=366:8></a> It says in verse 12, "For the same Lord of all is rich towards all that call upon him", and then it says, "For every one whosoever, who shall call on the name of the Lord, shall be saved".<a name=366:9></a> We have the promise of the support of the kingdom as we call upon the name of the Lord, but the object of calling upon the name of the Lord is that the thoughts of God may go through in spite of opposition, and be realised for His pleasure and glory.<a name=366:10></a>

		Now in the well-known scripture in <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>we have, I suppose, one of the greatest thoughts connected with the assembly of God.<a name=366:11></a> The writer says, "For both he that sanctifies and those sanctified are all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, saying, I will

	<div class="paragraph">
		declare thy name to my brethren; in the midst of the assembly will I sing thy praises".<a name=367:1></a> A marvellous conception, beloved brethren, of the assembly as a vessel - a company - with which the Lord Jesus delights to identify Himself, and whom He is not ashamed to call brethren, saying, "I will declare thy name to my brethren; in the midst of the assembly will I sing thy praises".<a name=367:2></a> He Himself is singing the praises, but the assembly is the vessel in which that singing is given expression to.<a name=367:3></a> It is the singing of Christ, the singing of God's Son, but it is voiced through the assembly.<a name=367:4></a> How can we adequately measure what it is to God to be praised in such a vessel?<a name=367:5></a> Of what affection, of what intelligence is such a vessel capable, as identified with Christ!<a name=367:6></a> That is the divine conception, that in the midst of the assembly, Christ Himself praises God.<a name=367:7></a> Well now the writer says, "For both he that sanctifies and those sanctified are all of one" - that brings in what will appeal to every one of us.<a name=367:8></a> It is taking account of us down here, as set apart for the service and pleasure of God.<a name=367:9></a> How much it has involved in order that we might be set apart, dear brethren!<a name=367:10></a> It has involved the coming in of Christ, the incarnation, that great expression of divine wisdom, the incoming of a divine Person into manhood, in order that through His death we might be set apart at the present time for the pleasure of God, so as to form this wondrous vessel.<a name=367:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		If we may speak for a moment of the point in our spiritual history when we first got our link with Christ, we were touched by the expression of His love in His death, for there divine love has come into perfect expression, on the basis of accomplished righteousness.<a name=367:12></a> These great things

		are, as we may say, an integral and necessary part of the structure; and the apostle would bring it home to us that each one is a necessary part of this spiritual house in which are to be offered up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.<a name=369:1></a> It is composed of "living stones;" that is, of persons who have living affections capable of being moved Godward, by our Lord Jesus Christ; we are to grow up to that.<a name=369:2></a> The Lord would encourage everyone to understand that he is to be available, as a living part of this living structure in which the blessed God is to be served.<a name=369:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now with a view to that, the apostle exhorts us to lay aside certain things; not to expect that they will drop off, but to lay them aside, as judging them to be entirely incompatible with this great thought of the assembly of God to which we, through grace, belong.<a name=369:4></a> He says, "Laying aside therefore all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envyings and all evil speakings" - they are to be laid aside.<a name=369:5></a> You will remember that in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#12:1">Luke  12:1</a>, the Lord said to His disciples, first of all, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy".<a name=369:6></a> Hypocrisy is more innate in us than many of us realise - the desire to appear something that we are not - and the apostle calls upon us to lay it aside.<a name=369:7></a> Then he says, "Desire earnestly the pure mental milk of the word, that by it ye may grow up to salvation, if indeed ye have tasted that the Lord is good".<a name=369:8></a> He would stress the necessity of desiring earnestly this "pure mental milk of the word".<a name=369:9></a> It is an important and practical thing to consider what we feed our minds upon in these days.<a name=369:10></a> Let us bear in mind that God has called us to a great system of glory and wisdom, great enough to displace and eclipse all

		that this world can afford, and if we will only go in for it, and give our minds to Scripture and the ministry which the Lord so richly affords, we shall not be disappointed, but shall find a sufficiency to satisfy both heart and mind.<a name=370:1></a> The Spirit searches all things, yea, the depths of God; there is nothing within the realm of revelation which the Spirit does not search, and He is capable of making it all known to us as we, on our part, are ready to receive it.<a name=370:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then the apostle adds, "If indeed ye have tasted that the Lord is good;" that is, he would encourage every one of us to put the Lord to the test in our own individual exercises, to make Him our Confidant, to draw near to Him continually, to prove that He is good.<a name=370:3></a> It says, "To whom coming" - that is to be habitually characteristic of us.<a name=370:4></a> The intent of our mind is to be near Him, "To whom coming, a living stone".<a name=370:5></a> He is the One around whom the whole company is gathered.<a name=370:6></a> The more we get near to the Lord, the more He will impress upon us the blessedness of God, and that causes to spring up spiritual affections characteristic of the assembly of God.<a name=370:7></a> Even in the very early days of our conversion, how the Lord would draw near and teach us that in His own death God was commending His love towards us, "in that, we being still sinners, Christ has died for us" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:8">Romans  5:8</a>).<a name=370:8></a> It is as though when we come to appreciate Christ, He would take us in hand and say, 'Yes, but I want you to appreciate God'.<a name=370:9></a> "God commends <i>his</i> love to us".<a name=370:10></a> Then later on we begin to take account of the greatness of Christ as a divine Person who became Man, in order to bring to light and carry into effect all the blessed purposes of divine love, and as coming to Him we

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle Peter speaks most touchingly to us of the Lord Jesus: he says, "Cast away indeed as worthless by men" - that is man's estimate of Jesus, but with God He is chosen and precious.<a name=371:3></a> Are we going to range ourselves alongside of the world that has cast away as worthless our Lord Jesus?<a name=371:4></a> Or shall we keep our hearts in the sense that He is chosen of God and precious?<a name=371:5></a> If we do the latter, we shall be greatly helped in the refusal of features that are inconsistent with the Man that God so highly delights in.<a name=371:6></a> There is a tendency with most of us to carry over certain features of the man that God has judged, perhaps in the form of worldly ways and expressions in speech; behind all which is the desire to evade the reproach of being identified with the Man that the world has cast away as worthless, but who is chosen of God and precious.<a name=371:7></a> God would have us grow in the positive appreciation of that Man, and to understand that if we are to have part acceptably in the assembly of God it is essential that we should take on the features that are suited to it, features that have been set out in perfection in Jesus.<a name=371:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To refer back to <a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2">Hebrews  2</a>, we have there the greatest conception of the assembly of God as a vessel down here, in the very presence of Satan's influence and power, in which God is praised, not according to the smallness of the thoughts of men, but in the spirit and intelligence of God's

		Son.<a name=372:1></a> It is a marvellous conception.<a name=372:2></a> God has not only set us in the position of sonship for His own pleasure, and has given us the Spirit of His Son, so that we become capable of the same character of affections Godward as marked Jesus Himself, but it is also true as we have it in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:7">Ephesians  1:7</a> - 9, "According to the riches of his grace; which he has caused to abound towards us in all wisdom and intelligence, having made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure".<a name=372:3></a> God delights in the intelligence of His people, not only in their being formed in the affections of sons, but also in their being intelligent, so that they may be sympathetic with Himself, and able to praise Him in a way that is worthy of His great name.<a name=372:4></a> What vessel other than the assembly could be capable of such wondrous response to the blessed God?<a name=372:5></a> A company of which Christ Himself is not ashamed, and in the midst of which He takes His place, in order that praise may find adequate expression.<a name=372:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in closing, I want to refer to the scriptures read in Timothy and in Corinthians, in order to draw attention to another feature of glory connected with the assembly of God which is to come into practical expression.<a name=372:7></a> Thank God it is already seen thus.<a name=372:8></a> In <a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#5:5">1 Timothy  5:5</a>, the apostle describes one who is "a widow indeed".<a name=372:9></a> It reads, "She who is a widow indeed, and is left alone, has put her hope in God, and continues in supplications and prayers night and day".<a name=372:10></a> God allows such persons to be found among His saints.<a name=372:11></a> We might say, 'Why should God allow a poor lonely woman to be desolate?<a name=372:12></a> Why should she be left without any natural support or resource?<a name=372:13></a>' I think it is, on the one hand, to draw forth from her that trust in God which so greatly
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=373>[Page 373]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		glorifies Him, and, on the other hand, as she thus trusts in God, from whence comes the answer to her trust?<a name=373:1></a> It is, of course, from God Himself as Source that she gets her answer, but it is expressed through the assembly, which thus becomes to her the expression of the glory of God.<a name=373:2></a> In verse 16, we read that a believing man or woman having widows depending on them is to care for them, that the assembly be not charged, so that it may come to the relief of those who are "really widows" (verse 3).<a name=373:3></a> One who is really a widow trusts in God, and He causes her to find the answer to her trust in the assembly, which thus becomes the expression of the glory of God to her.<a name=373:4></a> He proves, in this way, that He can be trusted by the one who is desolate, He will not fail to succour and support her.<a name=373:5></a> Whatever responsibility the assembly assumes in charging itself with what she needs, that is to be welcomed by us, not as a mere matter of charity, as with the world, but as an occasion for the expression of what God is, in a vessel in which confidence in God shall find its answer.<a name=373:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		When we come to the passage in 2 Corinthians, we find the apostle dealing with need outside the immediate circle of the assembly concerned, and it is an occasion for the saints to move out, even to brethren they do not know, in an expression of love and care that glorifies God.<a name=373:7></a> The apostle is seeking to develop this feature of the assembly, he is greatly concerned that this feature, proper to the assembly of God, should be developed and expressed.<a name=373:8></a> Hence, dear brethren, God may allow things to arise among His people in one part of the world which are intended to bring into expression in saints in another part, whether near
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=374>[Page 374]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		or far, this feature of the assembly as the vessel in which the divine glory is resident.<a name=374:1></a> In order to encourage the saints to be on this line of giving, the apostle says, "He that sows sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he that sows in the spirit of blessing shall reap also in blessing".<a name=374:2></a> The spirit of blessing - what a beautiful thought that is!<a name=374:3></a> God is the Blesser, and He loves to bless, as we see in the priests of old, who were to bless in Jehovah's name.<a name=374:4></a> So we are to be representative of God in His character of Blesser.<a name=374:5></a> We are to give in the spirit of blessing, because in so doing we are expressing the blessed God, and what could be greater than that?<a name=374:6></a> The apostle adds, "God is able to make every gracious gift abound towards you, that, having in every way always all-sufficiency, ye may abound to every good work".<a name=374:7></a> As though he would say, 'If only the saints show themselves ready to come out like God in this feature of giving in the spirit of blessing, God on His part will see that they do not lack what is necessary for it'.<a name=374:8></a> He is concerned that this feature of divine glory should come into expression.<a name=374:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then finally he says, "Enriched in every way unto all free-hearted liberality, which works through us thanksgiving to God", and in the next verse he says, "The ministration of this service .<a name=374:10></a>.<a name=374:11></a>.<a name=374:12></a> also abounding by many thanksgivings to God; they glorifying God through the proof of this ministration .<a name=374:13></a>.<a name=374:14></a>.<a name=374:15></a> and in their supplication for you, full of ardent desire for you, on account of the exceeding grace of God which is upon you".<a name=374:16></a> Then he closes on this note, "Thanks be to God for his unspeakable free gift".<a name=374:17></a> The very giving of the saints to other saints causes

		I want to bring before you the amazing character of the recovery which God has given to the assembly in these closing days.<a name=377:1></a> I do not think anyone could possibly exaggerate the favour which has been given to us in these things which God has recovered for us; things with which the assembly started at the outset; truths which affected thousands of souls at the beginning and brought them out from the world and set them in living relation to a Man in glory.<a name=377:2></a> Believers then were under the immediate power and influence of the Holy Spirit who had come from heaven at Pentecost, consequent on a Man having gone into heaven.<a name=377:3></a> The effect was wonderful, as we know, if we have read the book of the Acts.<a name=377:4></a>

		It was extraordinary in result as the truth spread abroad wherever the apostles went, particularly Paul; they were results characterised by the power of the Spirit of God.<a name=377:5></a> The apostle Paul, who was a most able man with great natural powers and learning, tells us that when he went to Corinth he was careful to present nothing but "Jesus Christ, and <i>him</i> crucified", and that his word and preaching were not with words of human wisdom, but "in demonstration of the Spirit and of power" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#2:2">1 Corinthians  2:2</a> - 5); that their faith might stand, not in wisdom of men, but in

	<div class="paragraph">
		the power of God.<a name=378:1></a> Great effects thus followed at Corinth, for it was the Spirit of God who was working in souls.<a name=378:2></a> Alas!<a name=378:3></a> it was not very long before evil came in, and corruption, as Scripture itself makes clear.<a name=378:4></a> The truth was attacked by the enemy, and it came to pass that the immense truth that God brought out, as to a heavenly people on this earth, was rapidly lost.<a name=378:5></a> If it be asked how this came about, the answer would be simple, namely, that the mind of man was given a place in the assembly and took the place of the Spirit of God, the consequence being that, before very long, things with which the assembly started were practically lost.<a name=378:6></a> The writings of the 'fathers', so-called, who lived in the early centuries of Christianity, from the second to the fourth, show that they had lost the heavenly character of the gospel, and the assembly had become swallowed up in the world.<a name=378:7></a> In the beginning of the fourth century, the assembly was, to outward appearance, actually absorbed by the world, and Christianity, in place of heathenism, became the religion of the world.<a name=378:8></a> It is so to this very day.<a name=378:9></a> But God has graciously come in in the face of all this terrible departure, and revived for us the very things with which the assembly started at the beginning.<a name=378:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The truth of the presence and power of the Spirit of God has been recovered; the truth of the heavenly calling, and the fact that we are a heavenly people, and that our citizenship - this applies to all Christians - is in heaven; that we are united to a Man in glory and have received His Spirit, and consequently we are members of one body; all this has been most graciously recovered.<a name=378:11></a> I would speak a little with regard to these things, that we, in our day, may

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		be warned against the particular dangers that led to the departure at the outset.<a name=379:1></a> In the address to the assembly at Philadelphia, there is one word of warning given - only one - amid words of most wonderful encouragement: "Hold fast what thou hast, that no one take thy crown" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:11">Revelation  3:11</a>).<a name=379:2></a> We need to weigh that word, so that as valuing what has been recovered we might hold fast that which we have received, that no man take our crown.<a name=379:3></a> We are in danger of the world creeping in, and influences which indicate that man's mind is again at work.<a name=379:4></a> It comes into divine things.<a name=379:5></a> All this we have to watch; and another thing is, that we may profess a great deal which is most admirable, and yet not have it in power in our souls.<a name=379:6></a> We have to attend to it, that what God has graciously recovered to us may become effective in the Spirit's power in our souls.<a name=379:7></a> It is in Scripture, but is it in you and in me?<a name=379:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I want to develop this line a little from the book of Proverbs.<a name=379:9></a> There are three statements by Wisdom; three times she speaks, and I have no doubt that those three voices have their counterpart, firstly, in the ministry of John the baptist; secondly, in that of the Lord Himself; and thirdly, in the testimony of the Spirit.<a name=379:10></a>

		In the first chapter Wisdom speaks appealingly and impressively to all, on the line of rebuke: "Turn you at my reproof;" together with that, there is a promise held out, "I will pour forth my spirit unto you, I will make known to you my words".<a name=379:11></a> That gives the line of John's ministry, a ministry largely of rebuke, calling people to repentance, but with promise of blessing close at hand.<a name=379:12></a> There is something very solemn about John's appeal.<a name=379:13></a> He told people that the

		When, in the synagogue of Nazareth, the Lord opened the book of Isaiah, He read, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to preach glad tidings to the poor; he has sent me to preach to captives deliverance, and to the blind sight, to send forth the crushed delivered, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4:18">Luke  4:18</a>, 19).<a name=381:4></a> Wonderful piping was heard then!<a name=381:5></a> The congregation in the synagogue could not help bearing witness to the words of grace that proceeded out of His mouth, but then they say, "Is not this the son of Joseph?<a name=381:6></a>" (verse 22) - as though to say, 'Why listen to Him?<a name=381:7></a>' I think there has been a great recovery on the line of piping in this our day.<a name=381:8></a> If only our ears were more open to it, there would be a great deal of spiritual dancing; there would be a greater response from people who would then come out in character like the One who at first gave the testimony; the meek and lowly One.<a name=381:9></a> It is a great thing to learn of Him and to come out in His character here.<a name=381:10></a> It would be a great testimony if our hearts were more moved by the wonderful nature of the blessing which is ours now, consequent on the death, resurrection and glory of God's beloved Son!<a name=381:11></a>

		I wish, dear brethren, to speak of God's way and God's end.<a name=401:1></a> The Lord is bringing the end much before us, not so much the end which will be reached in the eternal day, but rather the end which is to be reached in the service of God in the assembly now.<a name=401:2></a> If we get some sense of the end that is before God, and we are helped to contemplate the way by which that end is reached, it will greatly promote the spirit of worship, and add enrichment to it.<a name=401:3></a> I suppose we might say that the end that God has in view is that He should find pleasure in having the sons of men before Him in an order of manhood wholly according to His own desire, and with intelligent appreciation of His own glory and blessedness, with the ability and liberty in known nearness and relationship to respond to that glory.<a name=401:4></a> That, I believe, is the end which is before the heart of the blessed God.<a name=401:5></a> He desires to be surrounded with an innumerable company of those able to appreciate fully what He is, in so far as He may be known by the creature, and who find their happiness in responding to Him in appreciation of all the varied lights in which divine glory is to be known.<a name=401:6></a>

		understand, that God, having a definite end before His mind, committed Himself to wisdom, in the reaching of that end, before He began any operations.<a name=402:1></a> Before He commenced any works, the whole matter, so to speak, was thought out in wisdom; and then, having committed Himself to wisdom, He begins to operate to reach the end that He has in mind.<a name=402:2></a> "His way", I believe, suggests a divinely ordered sequence of operations by which God reaches the end that He has in mind.<a name=402:3></a> If we contemplate God's way, and see how undiverted He has been in it, working in wisdom and with method from beginning to end, it will greatly enhance our appreciation of divine glory.<a name=402:4></a> So one desires help from the Lord to touch on certain outstanding features of God's way, bearing in mind that His way subserves the end that He has in view.<a name=402:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first feature in His way would be creation.<a name=402:6></a> It says, "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#1:1">Genesis  1:1</a>); that is to say, He brought into existence by almighty power the sphere in which He would work out His thoughts.<a name=402:7></a> We know that disaster came in between the time spoken of in the first verse of the book of Genesis and that of the second verse, but that only provided occasion for God to show in His subsequent operations, by way of testimony, how He would operate in the moral and spiritual sphere to bring order out of chaos, and life out of death, and so on; but the first great feature that I see in the divine way is <i>creation</i>.<a name=402:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One would pass on then to the great fact of <i>the incarnation</i>.<a name=402:9></a> There was much that came in between the creation and the incoming of Christ which would well repay

	<div class="paragraph">
		consideration, as to what part it plays in the way of God, but one desires to speak for a moment on the incarnation and all that results from it for the blessed God.<a name=403:1></a> You remember how the angels spoke to the shepherds, announcing the incoming of Christ, and said, "This is the sign to you: ye shall find", not "<i>the</i> babe", as in the Authorised Version - that is, he was not exactly calling attention at the moment to the Person of Jesus, but "ye shall find <i>a babe</i> wrapped in swaddling-clothes, and lying in a manger".<a name=403:2></a> But then immediately the multitude of the heavenly host was suddenly heard, saying, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good pleasure in men", as though all was assured in the coming in of Christ.<a name=403:3></a> The glory of God was assured; God's good pleasure in men was assured; but in divine wisdom the sign given to the shepherds was "a babe wrapped in swaddling-clothes, and lying in a manger", as though God would intimate at the outset that His mode of operation was intended to set aside completely all that the natural mind of man would boast in.<a name=403:4></a> His people were to accustom themselves to the idea that God would work in outward smallness, in outward weakness, and, indeed, in conditions which would suggest what would be contemptible in the eyes of men - "lying in a manger".<a name=403:5></a> It is indeed part of the divine glory that God can entirely conceal the greatest things He is effecting from the natural mind of man.<a name=403:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the sign given to the shepherds was that they should find a Babe.<a name=403:7></a> What is so small and insignificant as a Babe wrapped in swaddling-clothes and lying in a manger?<a name=403:8></a> He was not in outward honour at all, but at the same time the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		heavenly messengers, as understanding the mind of heaven, say, "Glory to God in the highest" - all was assured - "and on earth peace, good pleasure in men".<a name=404:1></a> There is much involved in the incarnation, but one thing I see in it among others, and that is that there was then introduced into this scene the order of manhood that God intended to have before Him eternally for His pleasure, and in which alone His thoughts can be realised.<a name=404:2></a> So, as we well know, the gospel of Luke engages us with the manhood of Jesus, the unique character of it, the holy character of it, and how Jesus grew up before God through every stage of human life, till at last, at the age of thirty, the heavens were opened upon Him, and there was a voice out of heaven, saying, "<i>Thou</i> art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight" (chapter 3: 22).<a name=404:3></a> That voice expressed the delight of God in the moral excellencies that were now under His eye in Jesus, and expressed at the same time that now there was a Man before God in the relationship of Son and owned as Son, ministering pleasure to the Father's heart as a Son.<a name=404:4></a> Beloved, in that there was the guarantee that God would secure all that upon which His heart was set.<a name=404:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So for a moment we might go on to contemplate the scene on the mount of transfiguration, as we have it in Luke's gospel, where we have the One who was saluted out of heaven at His baptism, now for a moment, so to speak, in His own scene.<a name=404:6></a> It says in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#9:28">Luke  9:28</a>, 29, "Taking Peter and John and James he went up into a mountain to pray.<a name=404:7></a> And as he prayed the fashion of his countenance became different and his raiment white and effulgent".<a name=404:8></a> But He was not alone.<a name=404:9></a> "Two men talked with him, who were Moses and

		Elias, who, appearing in glory", as though God was intimating to Peter, John and James that His thought was to have men before Him after the pattern of Jesus; that He might have His pleasure in men.<a name=405:1></a> How fitting, how in accord with the scene Moses and Elias were!<a name=405:2></a> Moses, the meekest man in all the earth, who had taken on, by God's work in him before Jesus appeared, the features of Jesus.<a name=405:3></a> Moses, a man who stood like a lion for the rights of God, as Jesus did; and Elijah similarly, standing alone for the rights of God on Mount Carmel, before four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal, and four hundred prophets of the Asherah; how in keeping they were with the scene of God's pleasure where Jesus is!<a name=405:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, the temptation by the devil in the wilderness, only brought into greater display that now at last in Jesus God had a Man who was incorruptible.<a name=405:5></a> He could be tested with "every temptation;" for it says, "The devil, having completed every temptation, departed from him" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#4:13">Luke  4:13</a>), as though every influence of evil that had been brought to bear on the first man was brought to bear on Jesus in those forty days, only to bring into relief that one great result of the incarnation, the coming into manhood of a divine Person, was that now there was a Man before God who was wholly incorruptible; a Man whose motives could be brought into the light and were seen to be wholly in accord with the blessed God.<a name=405:6></a> God is securing, and is going to secure, man after that order for His pleasure.<a name=405:7></a> We can see these steps in succession in the divine way, the second one to which I have referred being this great matter of the incarnation.<a name=405:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Then one desires to speak for a moment on the scripture read in <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>which has in view <i>the death of Christ</i>.<a name=406:1></a> If creation was one great feature in the way of God, if the incarnation is another great feature in that way, there is also the great feature of redemption, and all that came to light in redemption; how God was glorified there.<a name=406:2></a> You notice the setting: it says, just before, that Satan entered into Judas, and he went out, the Lord having said to him, "What thou doest, do quickly".<a name=406:3></a> That is, Satan now had an instrument in Judas Iscariot by which what Satan is was fully set forth.<a name=406:4></a> By means of that man, Judas Iscariot, there was expressed the most absolute moral depravity conceivable, and the most absolute hatred of absolute good.<a name=406:5></a> The nature of Satan came into expression at that moment in that man Judas Iscariote.<a name=406:6></a> Now in contrast to that Jesus says, "Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him".<a name=406:7></a> The Lord is not there speaking, I understand, of Himself being glorified at the right hand of God.<a name=406:8></a> He is rather speaking of His being morally glorified in going down into death.<a name=406:9></a> It was His glory that in His death He would bring the glory of God into full display.<a name=406:10></a> What a contrast to the expression of evil, having its origin in Satan and its expression in Judas!<a name=406:11></a> There was now a Man in Jesus in whom, in death, God would be absolutely glorified.<a name=406:12></a> When Jesus died there was the most complete vindication of God's holiness; His absolute abhorrence and unsparing judgment of evil; there was the assertion, the establishment, of God's rights.<a name=406:13></a> There was the bringing into glorious display of divine love.<a name=406:14></a> It was a question of the depths to which divine love could go.<a name=406:15></a> Wisdom says, "When there

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		were no depths;" she refers to a time before depths were in existence; but surely the depths came into full expression in the cross of Jesus.<a name=407:1></a> It is a question of the depths to which divine love could go, and the wonderful conciliation at that point of every attribute of God, and divine love shining out in its triumph through it all.<a name=407:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then, dear brethren, not only was God glorified there, but the Son of man was glorified too, for it brought into display features of moral excellence in Christ; wonderful devotion to God's holy will, wondrous love to those who were in the purpose of God.<a name=407:3></a> All this and much more came into expression.<a name=407:4></a> Not only was God glorified, but the Son of man was glorified.<a name=407:5></a> In a way, features that had not come fully into expression in His pathway here - though ever there - came now fully into expression when Jesus died: obedience unto death, and that the death of the cross; devotedness to God's will at all cost to Himself; every feature of moral glory shone out at that time, both as the expression of what Jesus is, and also as the outshining of the glory of God.<a name=407:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let me now pass on to the scripture in Ephesians, to speak of two more features of the divine way which I think we must take account of.<a name=407:7></a> One is the <i>resurrection of Christ</i>, which brings into evidence divine glory in a remarkable way, for it entirely shuts out man, and it entirely shuts out Satan.<a name=407:8></a> One has been encouraged in remembering what the Lord Himself said: "Fear not those who kill the body and after this have no more that they can do" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#12:4">Luke  12:4</a>).<a name=407:9></a> Death is the limit of Satan's power: once he has slain a saint there is no more he can do.<a name=407:10></a> What a comfort that is, for

	<div class="paragraph">
		we know the God of resurrection, and when resurrection is before our souls we have before us a platform where the glory is entirely of God, where man is entirely excluded, for man cannot raise the dead, and Satan is entirely overcome.<a name=408:1></a> That is a great thing to lay hold of, that in resurrection God has brought in a power by which He will establish all His thoughts on a platform exclusive of all evil, of all that which is of the first man, a platform on which divine glory is displayed marvellously.<a name=408:2></a> That has come to pass before our eyes in Christ, and the same mighty power in which God wrought in Christ in raising Him from among the dead is operating towards us in order to bring us into our portion according to the mind of God.<a name=408:3></a>

		There is yet another item in the divine way of which I would speak, and that is <i>the exaltation of Christ</i>, or, what goes along with it on another line, <i>the ascension of Christ</i>.<a name=408:4></a> The exaltation of Christ is spoken of in the first chapter of Ephesians.<a name=408:5></a> It is a question of what God has done, that He has not only raised up Christ from among the dead, but He has set Him down as a Man in the highest glory conceivable, and in setting Him down in the highest place God sets forth what He intends to do for the saints.<a name=408:6></a> It is said in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:5">Ephesians  2:5</a> - 7 that He "has quickened us with the Christ .<a name=408:7></a>.<a name=408:8></a>.<a name=408:9></a> and has raised us up together, and has made us sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus, that he might display in the coming ages the surpassing riches of his grace in kindness towards us in Christ Jesus".<a name=408:10></a> That is, the place of Christ in heaven sets forth the exceeding riches of God's grace in regard to what He will do for the saints, that He will have men in a most elevated, exalted position

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Along with that goes also the thought of ascension, which is Christ's own act.<a name=409:2></a> "I ascend" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#20:17">John  20:17</a>), He says, speaking in His own right, and of His own power, "to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God".<a name=409:3></a> It is, as it were, the final act in that great service of Christ in bringing in for the Father's pleasure what His heart would delight in.<a name=409:4></a> So He says, "I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God", as bringing His brethren into the most favoured position in which God delights to have the sons of men, in order that the Father's heart might be fully gratified according to the greatness of His own thoughts.<a name=409:5></a>

		Well, dear brethren, these things, I believe, will repay consideration, these definite outstanding steps in the divine way: creation, incarnation, redemption, resurrection, exaltation or ascension - all these are outstanding features of the divine way by which God is reaching His end.<a name=409:6></a> But then, so far, all that one has been speaking of is outside of ourselves; that is to say, it is all objective.<a name=409:7></a> But there is another outstanding feature in the divine way, and that is the incoming of the Holy Spirit - a marvellous thing to take account of!<a name=409:8></a> The incarnation is a wonderful expression of divine wisdom, an expression of marvellous grace; but the incoming of the Holy Spirit is also marvellous - the coming

		One cannot enlarge on these things; one can only bring them before you, dear brethren, suggestively, as indicating a line of thought which will tend to enrich us in our appreciation of the blessed God.<a name=411:8></a> When we come on to the line of divine purpose, we know that that is entirely apart from any question of sin.<a name=411:9></a> But in the wisdom of the divine way God has permitted that sin should come in, that moral questions should be involved, and that we should be

		In the scripture in Chronicles we read that "it came to pass when the trumpeters and singers were as one".<a name=412:4></a> That is, I believe, what God would bring us to in assembly, that we should be as one.<a name=412:5></a> The Spirit has a great part in that.<a name=412:6></a> "In the power of one Spirit <i>we</i> have all been baptised into one body" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:13">1 Corinthians  12:13</a>) - a thing, I am sure, we all need help upon, to learn how to merge in the power of the Spirit in one body, so that we move together as one.<a name=412:7></a> But here in this scripture it is contemplated that that is fully known and understood, and as the divine glory, as apprehended in Christ, is before the hearts of the saints, they move as one, with one voice, to celebrate God, and He reaches His end.<a name=412:8></a> It says that when that took place, "Then the house, the house of Jehovah, was filled with a cloud, and the priests could not stand to do their service because of the cloud; for the

		One has often thought, dear brethren, in this connection, of the throne that Solomon made - the throne of ivory overlaid with pure gold, the ivory suggesting to us what is permanent, and the pure gold the expression of divine glory.<a name=413:5></a> It is, I believe, a suggestion of God Himself as supreme in the outshining of His glory, the throne dominating, so to speak, the whole scene.<a name=413:6></a> It says, there were six steps to the throne.<a name=413:7></a> I do not think that means there are literally six steps: it is to suggest an ordered, complete way, by which the divine end is reached; but there were six steps, and on each step there were two lions, reminding us that as the lion turneth not away for any, so God has pursued His way, not turning away, so to speak, for any.<a name=413:8></a> Rather the efforts of the enemy to thwart have only brought to light that God could not be turned away for any.<a name=413:9></a> There was apparently the activity of an enemy after God created the heavens and the earth; there came in chaos and darkness, but it only served, as one said before, to give opportunity for God to show typically, by way of testimony, how He would move in the moral and spiritual sphere to glorify Himself, in bringing order out of chaos, and life out of death.<a name=413:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two thoughts in this epistle as to God: "God is light", and "God is love".<a name=417:1></a> The desire on my heart is that we might be able to pursue these thoughts as the Spirit would unfold them to us, and so come out characteristically as walking in the light and as to love, responding to it.<a name=417:2></a> I suppose we could have no proper knowledge of God as light except as that light has shone out through our Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=417:3></a> The words of John's gospel help in this respect.<a name=417:4></a> We read of Christ that, "In him was life, and the life was the light of men" (chapter 1: 4).<a name=417:5></a> There came under the eye of God, in Christ here, One who lived in the fullest possible way; who abidingly lived in the presence of God; who delighted in all that God is; and as He thus lived here His life was light, was light for men, and as He is seen in this way we have brought near to us for the first time what light truly is and what divine love is.<a name=417:6></a> It is beautiful thus to see these great qualities presented to us in a living way in Christ.<a name=417:7></a> His life is light for us, so that we might live through Him, who has brought God near.<a name=417:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have no doubt, beloved brethren, that is the way by which we come into these things; first, by seeing what life is, and then by seeing that the life was the light of men; and so in <a href="../bible/1John.htm#1">1 John  1</a>we have the introductory and favoured message of the epistle: "This is the message which we have

		heard from him, and declare to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all".<a name=418:1></a> Wonderful thoughts are brought near to us by the apostle John, thus we are privileged to enjoy the revelation of God as light, and to be found in the light in which God is, where no element of darkness exists.<a name=418:2></a> Darkness is what beclouds and holds us away from God, but as we are brought into the light, to walk in it, we are privileged to regard Him in a very precious and beautiful way, as in attractive light.<a name=418:3></a> What a wonderful purifying thought it is thus to know God, that darkness is not in Him.<a name=418:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then it is said in verse 7, "If we walk in the light as <i>he</i> is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from all sin".<a name=418:5></a> So that it has become possible for us to walk in the light as God is in the light, in the purity, blessedness, and preciousness of what God is.<a name=418:6></a> The great standard for us is, "As <i>he</i> is in the light".<a name=418:7></a> God is now disclosed to us - He is in the light.<a name=418:8></a> He was hidden by the darkness on account of Israel's condition and God's relations with them, but He has come out in Christ in this wonderful way - He is now manifested to us in light.<a name=418:9></a> There is now the full revelation of God in Christ, and we are privileged to walk in the light as God is in the light, and in so doing to have fellowship one with another.<a name=418:10></a> This thought of fellowship is very beautiful and precious.<a name=418:11></a> It does not mean merely that we agree with one another on certain points, and so are united, or that we have certain ideas that are similar to those of our brethren, but the walk is in the light, and in doing this we have fellowship with one another; thus we are common sharers with one another as walking with God in the light.<a name=418:12></a>

		We have previously had the thought of walking in light before us; an answer to "God is Light".<a name=421:1></a> I have in mind now the expression, "God is Love".<a name=421:2></a> The word here is, "Beloved, let us love one another".<a name=421:3></a> What a word to us!<a name=421:4></a> We are addressed as beloved, and we are exhorted to love one another.<a name=421:5></a> Now, let us not love at the expense of righteousness, for the love is to be enjoyed as the result of walking in the light.<a name=421:6></a> This is very practical and important, beloved brethren, and we do well to heed it.<a name=421:7></a> So that, as walking in the light, we are exhorted to love one another, for we only live as we love, and we only love as we walk in the light as God is in the light.<a name=421:8></a> Thus light, and fellowship connected with it, must come first, and then the loving one another follows; that is the order.<a name=421:9></a> I feel this very much for myself - the need of <i>loving</i> my brethren, and would heed the word, "Let us love one another".<a name=421:10></a> If love is thus in operation, we shall go on together in unity, exemplifying it in a practical way.<a name=421:11></a> It says, for example, "Love covers a multitude of sins" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#4:8">1 Peter  4:8</a>).<a name=421:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If I look upon my brethren, and say of one of them, 'He may be all right, but I question if his walk is orderly' - well, that is not love; the 'but' would not be there if I am carrying out the injunction in connection with light, because light produces transparency in me and in my brethren.<a name=421:13></a> It

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		also says, "If we confess our sins" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#1:9">1 John  1:9</a>).<a name=422:1></a> To whom would you limit that?<a name=422:2></a> You say that applies to an individual brother or sister.<a name=422:3></a> I do not think we should individualise that verse.<a name=422:4></a> "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins, and cleanse us from all unrighteousness".<a name=422:5></a> If we are walking in the light, we are walking in self-judgment; confessing is a constant thing.<a name=422:6></a> Therefore my brother becomes lovable to me, because he is walking in the light - he is living in transparency, and the blood <i>cleanses</i>; that is its quality and its abiding value.<a name=422:7></a> And so it says in chapter 4, "Let us love one another; because love is of God".<a name=422:8></a> You do not find it outside the proper Christian circle.<a name=422:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One has been surprised in passing by observing people in leaving the different churches of this city - are they together?<a name=422:10></a> No!<a name=422:11></a> Are they around the doors of their churches and chapels conversing together because they seize an opportunity of embracing one another in love and conversing about the things of God?<a name=422:12></a> No!<a name=422:13></a> There is an individual or sectional action instead; they go to their own houses, and so are isolated from one another.<a name=422:14></a> There is no divine love active, because it is not there.<a name=422:15></a> What is of God will always find its own company, and always find its answer in those who are of God in that sphere; they are bound to come together.<a name=422:16></a> So love is of God.<a name=422:17></a> Therefore we can work out this principle of loving one another in this way: for as loving one another we prove we are born of God, and know God.<a name=422:18></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But it is well to ever remember that we did not originate this love, it says, "Herein is love, not that we
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son a propitiation for our sins" (verse 10).<a name=423:1></a> We know God, as we see Him displayed in Christ here, but He is also known as displayed in one another and especially when seen in a sacrificial spirit in us, having been developed among us by the Spirit.<a name=423:2></a> We know these things consciously and thus we live, as it says; "<i>We</i> know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:14">1 John  3:14</a>).<a name=423:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then it says, "He that loves not has not known God; for God is love".<a name=423:4></a> I would just add a word or two as to that expression; it is very pronounced and blessed.<a name=423:5></a> I think this chapter provides the only place in Scripture where that short saying is found.<a name=423:6></a> We learn in verse 7 why we should love one another, even because love is of God; and then in verse 8, "He that loves not has not known God; for God is love".<a name=423:7></a> But in verse 16 we have brought before us what God is <i>essentially</i> - He is love.<a name=423:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is instructive to our hearts to reflect on this passage; the great truth of which is seen intimated in many scriptures, but it was reserved to John to give us in such brevity and fulness the stupendous thought that God is love!<a name=423:9></a> We need, beloved brethren, to be in exercise of soul that we carry in our spirits and in our manner and ways toward one another, this blessed, precious fact, that God is love, for all our outgoings toward one another are to be based upon it.<a name=423:10></a> Our God, whom we know, is love, and our actions are to be the result of that fact in our souls; the practice of love amongst ourselves.<a name=423:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My desire in speaking thus, beloved, is that we might be on a right footing towards one another; that we may

		When we come to the tabernacle and the position of the tribes in relation to it, what is presented initially and informally in Genesis now takes definite form.<a name=433:1></a> The east comes first, standing for hope and glory, the rising sun bringing into view faith's domain.<a name=433:2></a> The south indicates divine favour, genial and warm.<a name=433:3></a> Job's clothes were warmed by the south wind (<a href="../bible/Job.htm#37:17">Job  37:17</a>).<a name=433:4></a> In <a href="../bible/Numbers.htm#10">Numbers  10</a>the tribes in the east and south are set forward as preceding the sanctuary; according to these thoughts we are to proceed.<a name=433:5></a> If we are to move forward with God, how much we need the energising prospect of the east, followed up by the positive enjoyment of divine love as suggested in the south.<a name=433:6></a> What light and warmth would thus be assured to us in all our assembly movements.<a name=433:7></a> As blessed and encouraged thus together in the light of that morning without clouds, we can go forward in hope.<a name=433:8></a> What a prospect thus was Paul's in 2 Timothy, as looking on to the appearing of the Lord.<a name=433:9></a>

		I have in mind this evening to review some of the characteristics of believers in their collective position; and to inquire how far this collective position can be realised in the present day.<a name=453:1></a> On the one hand, there is a tendency to say that it is a beautiful idea, but it cannot be realised today, because of the ruin of the church; and on the other hand, there is the opposite tendency in assuming that we can erect little perfect churches, so to speak, everywhere, after the ancient model of the apostles, without any modification at all.<a name=453:2></a> Both these extremes are mistakes, but I want to show, if I can, that all the essential features in the collective position of believers not only can be held in the affections of those who seek to walk in separation from evil, however small in number they may be, but can be maintained and put into practice.<a name=453:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You will remember that in <a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#24">Exodus  24</a>we are told that Moses erected twelve pillars; and that on mount Carmel Elijah erected twelve stones for an altar, showing that, not only in the heyday of Israel's spiritual prosperity were the twelve pillars set up, but that when apostasy had set in, and Elijah had to stand against it, he recognised the significance of this matter, so that he erected the twelve stones according to the twelve tribes of Israel.<a name=453:4></a> So now, though we

		<a name=454>[Page 454]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		have fallen on evil days, as far as professing Christianity goes, yet we can still erect, so to speak, the twelve stones for the altar.<a name=454:1></a> We can recognise collective truths and act upon them.<a name=454:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the first collective truth I desire to speak to you about is <i>building</i>.<a name=454:3></a> It is connected with several aspects of the truth.<a name=454:4></a> Christ said, "On this rock I will build my assembly" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:18">Matthew  16:18</a>), that is, on the confession of His being the Son of God.<a name=454:5></a> It is referred to also in Ephesians and frequently elsewhere.<a name=454:6></a> It is an immense comfort in a tottering world, as it is at present, to know that He has said, "I will build my assembly, and hades' gates shall not prevail against it".<a name=454:7></a> I want that to sink deeply into our hearts.<a name=454:8></a> Whatever the condition of things is, what Christ builds cannot be prevailed against.<a name=454:9></a> We need not hang down our hands or our heads in depression.<a name=454:10></a> What He builds <i>will</i> stand, whatever happens.<a name=454:11></a> You may say the outward thing has failed and broken down - but not what Christ builds.<a name=454:12></a> It is "on this rock", and who can move that Rock?<a name=454:13></a> The Rock speaks of stability and durability - indestructibility.<a name=454:14></a> It is used in connection with the name of God about thirty times in the Old Testament, referring to the stability and indestructibility connected with Him.<a name=454:15></a> In <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#33:6">Isaiah  33:6</a> it says, "He [that is, Jehovah] shall be the stability of thy times".<a name=454:16></a> We can take that to ourselves - that whatever the times may be, He is the stability of our times.<a name=454:17></a> Things may change down here, as they do, and who shall tell what is going to happen next in the world?<a name=454:18></a> But God is the stability of our times.<a name=454:19></a> So the assembly takes character from that, and from this wonderful Builder, the Lord Jesus Christ; and it is
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=455>[Page 455]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		indestructible; nothing can move it.<a name=455:1></a> We can take great comfort from that, dear brethren.<a name=455:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in regard to that wonderful assembly which He says He is going to build, the aspect is universal; that is, there is but one; yet it is not convened as one.<a name=455:3></a> I suppose the only time in its history when it was really convened as one was at Pentecost; and the next time it is to be so, will be in the time of which Paul speaks in <a href="../bible/2Thessalonians.htm#2:1">2 Thessalonians  2:1</a>, "our gathering together to him".<a name=455:4></a> That will be the whole assembly.<a name=455:5></a> Now, it has another aspect, a local aspect, and we do get assemblies in localities: so that this truth has a general and a local aspect.<a name=455:6></a> The point for us is, whether that local aspect can still be maintained?<a name=455:7></a> Not that any body of Christians should claim to be it, but can they stand, or act according to the light of it?<a name=455:8></a> I think we can all recognise that it is quite possible to act in the light of it.<a name=455:9></a> We have proved many a time that in local assemblies, however small, we can act in the light of what the assembly is to Christ and find needed direction and comfort in so doing.<a name=455:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The building is also likened to a house.<a name=455:11></a> The house of God is always a general idea.<a name=455:12></a> You do not get, so to speak, little houses of God scattered about in various places: that is not the idea when the house of God is spoken of.<a name=455:13></a> It is spoken of as a great idea, a great dwelling-place, in which the main thought is that <i>God</i> dwells there.<a name=455:14></a> A house is for somebody to dwell in, and the house of God is where God dwells.<a name=455:15></a> Christians are the house of God, and God does dwell among them, and walk among them.<a name=455:16></a> Again I ask: Can we apply that now?<a name=455:17></a> Can we get the benefit of it now in spite of the ruin and failure?<a name=455:18></a> We can indeed, and we can have the
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=456>[Page 456]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		realisation of that great and wonderful fact that God dwells amongst His people.<a name=456:1></a> We - that is, believers having the Holy Spirit - are always the house of God, not only when the assembly is convened.<a name=456:2></a> We cannot convene the house of God universally, but we can enjoy the privileges, and exercise the discipline of the house of God.<a name=456:3></a> Timothy was told how to behave in the house of God - the assembly of the living God - and we can carry that thought through now, and act as in a place where God dwells.<a name=456:4></a> It is the habitation of God in the Spirit - what a remarkable thing!<a name=456:5></a> One is filled with wonder and admiration at God's great thoughts in regard to man, man in connection with Christ.<a name=456:6></a> Why should God want to dwell with men?<a name=456:7></a> It shows that God delights in men, and the fact that His Son has taken up manhood shows His delight in the human race as under Christ.<a name=456:8></a> Here we are in our little planet - it is said to be very small as compared with other heavenly bodies, but to this planet He who is God came and lived as a Man, the Son of God.<a name=456:9></a> The great problems of good and evil have been worked out, and are being worked out <i>here</i>, and now God is pleased to have a house on earth.<a name=456:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another form which building takes, and that is the temple.<a name=456:11></a> The temple and the house are sometimes spoken of interchangeably.<a name=456:12></a> For example, Solomon speaks of the temple he built as the house; it, too, is a dwelling-place.<a name=456:13></a> But the additional thoughts in regard to the temple are many.<a name=456:14></a> In the first place, it is a sacred shrine which is shut off for sacred purposes from profane or common use.<a name=456:15></a> That is the essence of the temple - it was a sacred enclosure.<a name=456:16></a> It is being built now.<a name=456:17></a> There are two aspects of it: one, universal, as in the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		passage in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:21">Ephesians  2:21</a>, the other local, as spoken of in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3:16">1 Corinthians  3:16</a>: "Ye are the temple of God".<a name=457:1></a> The first great characteristic of the temple is that it is holy.<a name=457:2></a> Holiness pervades that dwelling of God, and the next great feature of it is, everything there says, Glory!<a name=457:3></a> It is filled with glory, for the glory of God initiated it, and the glory of God shines there, everything speaks of the God of glory.<a name=457:4></a> Then, God being there, the next great thought is that light is there; it is a place where we can come and enquire.<a name=457:5></a> I pause to say, 'Can such an idea be realised now?<a name=457:6></a>' Thank God, it can!<a name=457:7></a> Without our claiming to be anything, we have found it so.<a name=457:8></a> We have found the holiness of God's temple, and that it speaks of His glory, and that the light is there - how light streams out from thence.<a name=457:9></a> It is not theoretical, it is intensely practical.<a name=457:10></a> We find the light as we assemble in temple character, and that is borne out by hundreds of God's saints; we delight in the temple.<a name=457:11></a> These are only some of the thoughts connected with the temple.<a name=457:12></a> In the holy city there is no temple, for God is its temple, and that bears out what I have been saying: there is no need for a separate enclosure in that city, because the whole place is filled with the presence of God.<a name=457:13></a> God and the Lamb are the temple thereof - they fill that scene.<a name=457:14></a> What a wonderful thing it is!<a name=457:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there is another thought, that of the body, according to the passages in Corinthians and Ephesians.<a name=457:16></a> It would be an immense subject if I tried to go over it in detail, but what I want to emphasise is its unity.<a name=457:17></a> Some have said the body is split up into innumerable fragments: not at all; it is still one, it is indivisible; it cannot be divided.<a name=457:18></a> There is one Spirit and one body.<a name=457:19></a> Each time we see the loaf

	<div class="paragraph">
		before us at the Lord's supper, we recognise there is still one body: we have to keep that in our souls.<a name=458:1></a> Then there are the functions of the body.<a name=458:2></a> See how flexible and adaptable it is!<a name=458:3></a> All the different members work together for the common good and the common end.<a name=458:4></a> Perhaps you say, 'Things are so disappointing, can we live in the light and truth of that?<a name=458:5></a>' We can indeed.<a name=458:6></a> The apostle points out that even those members which seem less honourable are absolutely necessary in the body.<a name=458:7></a> Of late years, as you know, men have found out that certain organs in the human body, which they thought to be of little use, are absolutely essential to life and health, and if you remove them, ill health or even death occurs.<a name=458:8></a> Applying this spiritually, how many members there are of the one body which function out of sight, which yet are absolutely essential!<a name=458:9></a> How much indeed do we owe to some poor, bedridden saint who, by prayer and supplication to God, effects what the world could never credit!<a name=458:10></a> They may be hidden, but they are all essential to the life of the body.<a name=458:11></a> It is an organism.<a name=458:12></a> In modern language, we speak of a body of Christians, or a body of this or that; but that does not give the true scriptural sense of the body.<a name=458:13></a> It is a real organism, having one Spirit.<a name=458:14></a> There cannot be two diverse warring elements in the body of Christ.<a name=458:15></a> We must resolutely refuse anything that denies that unity.<a name=458:16></a> This is what has led many of us out from the great organisations of christendom, for their existence denies the unity of the body.<a name=458:17></a> Do not think for a moment that any body of Christians, here or elsewhere, could claim to be the body; not at all; but we can refuse any imitation of the body, or anything that denies its unity.<a name=458:18></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the body is a general idea, but it is also local.<a name=459:1></a> Paul says to the Corinthians, "Now <i>ye</i> are Christ's body" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#12:27">1 Corinthians  12:27</a>); in other words, there is a local representation of the body in any particular place, suited to the place.<a name=459:2></a> It is sufficient for the place - another thought we have to keep in mind.<a name=459:3></a> Then there is the Ephesian aspect of which I want to say a few words.<a name=459:4></a> There are two thoughts in connection with it, which I confess to you have been the stay and comfort of my heart for many long years.<a name=459:5></a> The first is, that the assembly, which is Christ's body, is the fulness of Him who fills all in all.<a name=459:6></a> The fulness means the complement.<a name=459:7></a> It needs the idea of the assembly to fill out the great thought of the Christ.<a name=459:8></a> What a remarkable conception!<a name=459:9></a> that the assembly is necessary to complete God's thought of the Christ - it is His body.<a name=459:10></a> And the second great thought is, <i>union</i>, not individual union, like "he that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#6:17">1 Corinthians  6:17</a>), but this other great thought of God, that just as the husband is joined to the wife, so the assembly is to Christ.<a name=459:11></a> That is the idea of union - union as between a wife and her husband.<a name=459:12></a> It is a general thought connected with the whole body and the whole assembly, but each of us has to apprehend it individually.<a name=459:13></a> The one who apprehends this individually finds in his heart that if he is in union with Christ, there is no interest for him apart from Christ and His interests.<a name=459:14></a> We do not reserve anything from Him.<a name=459:15></a> If you have certain interests, and you can make them Christ's interest, well, but if not, drop them.<a name=459:16></a> It is like a wife merging herself in the interests of her husband.<a name=459:17></a> If you knew union you would be not only wrapped in the love of Christ, which is one great thought; but

		<a name=460>[Page 460]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		because of it, no interest of yours would be diverse from His.<a name=460:1></a> You cannot imagine anything more wonderful than that such a state should exist here on earth!<a name=460:2></a> In the future it will exist in all its fulness, but we can each of us enter into it now, and, keeping it in our minds, we can behold the whole assembly.<a name=460:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is another set of ideas connected with what is collective, and that is the family.<a name=460:4></a> It is a collective idea, and I want to speak of it in three sections.<a name=460:5></a> The first is the thought of children, as I read in <a href="../bible/1John.htm#3">1 John  3</a>"See what love the Father has given to us, that we should be called the children of God".<a name=460:6></a> Reflect on that for a moment and see what it suggests: that God has been pleased to beget after His own moral likeness those whom He admits to His family.<a name=460:7></a> Can you think of anything more wonderful?<a name=460:8></a> That in you, and in me, there is that which is begotten of God - that which God begets.<a name=460:9></a> What a dignity and intimacy it gives us!<a name=460:10></a> What do children do?<a name=460:11></a> First of all, they love their begetter - that is obvious; and secondly, they partake of his moral character.<a name=460:12></a> Then again, as children, they are heirs.<a name=460:13></a> The idea of children is indestructible; there is that in us which is of God, and it can never be destroyed.<a name=460:14></a> We are said to be "heirs of God, and Christ's joint heirs" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:17">Romans  8:17</a>), and who can ever deprive us of that?<a name=460:15></a> If we ceased to be children of God, we should cease to be heirs - it is a family idea, and indestructible.<a name=460:16></a> How great a thing it is to recognise that we have this divine work in our souls.<a name=460:17></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then another idea connected with the family is that we are sons.<a name=460:18></a> We are said to be sons by adoption.<a name=460:19></a> There are five references to adoption in the New Testament.<a name=460:20></a> In four of
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=461>[Page 461]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		them the word is translated "adoption", but in <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:5">Galatians  4:5</a> it is "sonship".<a name=461:1></a> The original word contains the idea of adoption; that is, it is by adoption that God admits us to this privilege of being sons.<a name=461:2></a> Sons conveys a dignified idea, but is not in contrast to John's word for children.<a name=461:3></a> Sons is used in contrast to infants, as in <a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#4:1">Galatians  4:1</a>.<a name=461:4></a> "When I was a child" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#13:11">1 Corinthians  13:11</a>), means when he was an infant; not a child of God, but an infant.<a name=461:5></a> It is a different word from that used by John for "children of God".<a name=461:6></a> So the word "sons" implies dignity; not that we do not need discipline as sons.<a name=461:7></a> We do, for "who is the son that the father chastens not" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#12:7">Hebrews  12:7</a>).<a name=461:8></a> However dignified the sons may be, they have to go through discipline.<a name=461:9></a> But then think of the future, when we shall be conformed to the image of God's Son!<a name=461:10></a> What more glorious or wonderful prospect!<a name=461:11></a> In regard to children it says, "We shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#3:2">1 John  3:2</a>).<a name=461:12></a> John is referring to children; the two thoughts are related but different.<a name=461:13></a> Think of what sonship leads to through the redemption of the body, because sonship is called that - it is complete conformity to Christ in glory.<a name=461:14></a> So it is said, "Bringing many sons to glory" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:10">Hebrews  2:10</a>); that is our blessed future position.<a name=461:15></a> Now, indeed, we enjoy it in spirit, but it leads up to that wonderful position in which we shall ever remain.<a name=461:16></a> I point out to you that this is indestructible.<a name=461:17></a> You cannot destroy the relation in which you stand to God.<a name=461:18></a> You address Him, in correspondence to it, as Father, and nothing shall destroy it.<a name=461:19></a> It is a general family thought, to be entered into now, it is not lost by the defection in christendom.<a name=461:20></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=462>[Page 462]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there is a third way in which the family thought comes in in connection with <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2">Ephesians  2</a>, and that is as the 'household of God'.<a name=462:1></a> In searching the Scriptures, you will find that the idea of households is largely connected with food; so the virtuous woman in <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#31">Proverbs  31</a>gives food to her household.<a name=462:2></a> We find that Solomon sent Hiram food for his household.<a name=462:3></a> Joseph, too, sent food for Jacob's household, and there are many other instances in the Old Testament connecting the thought of food with the household.<a name=462:4></a> In the New Testament, the servant who is set over his lord's household is blessed, if he gives them meat or food in due season.<a name=462:5></a> So I think it may be safely said that one of the main ideas connected with the household is this supply of food.<a name=462:6></a> There are other thoughts connected with the household.<a name=462:7></a> Proverbs speaks of the household of the virtuous woman as being clothed in scarlet; and then again, she looks well to the ways of her household.<a name=462:8></a> So that we have not only the thought of food, but of clothing and order connected with the idea of the household.<a name=462:9></a> It is a great collective idea, but to be enjoyed now in these three features.<a name=462:10></a> I need not say to you how abundant has been the supply of spiritual food given to us!<a name=462:11></a> How bountifully God has provided for us week by week and year by year.<a name=462:12></a> All these blessings of the household are indeed ours.<a name=462:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Another aspect of the assembly I would touch upon is the bride; this also is a collective idea for the future.<a name=462:14></a> We read, "His wife has made herself ready" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#19:7">Revelation  19:7</a>) - referring to the marriage of the Lamb.<a name=462:15></a> That is the public announcement of what already exists, because if union exists there has been marriage.<a name=462:16></a> "The marriage of the Lamb

	<div class="paragraph">
		is come, and his wife has made herself ready;" that is the public display, when all shall know that the assembly is the bride of Christ; when she comes forth in the clothing Christ has granted her to wear.<a name=463:1></a> The robes she has woven in her sojourn here are allowed to deck her for the day of public glory.<a name=463:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is a still further thought I desire to bring before you, and that is contained in the passage in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#2:19">Ephesians  2:19</a>, "Fellow-citizens of the saints".<a name=463:3></a> There is the political or citizen aspect of the assembly, and if you want to know the details of it you will find them beautifully described in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21">Revelation  21</a>.<a name=463:4></a> Every department found necessary for the government of a good city is found there.<a name=463:5></a> First, there is authority, for the throne of God is there; there is provision for divine service, too, for God is the temple of it.<a name=463:6></a> Every human city makes provision for the religious side, and so here, God and the Lamb are its temple.<a name=463:7></a> There is the idea of protection too, walls great and high, and sentries at the gates.<a name=463:8></a> There are no police in that city, its protection is from the outside.<a name=463:9></a> It is a city with foundations, and the names of the twelve apostles are built into them, and it is garnished with precious stones; in other words, the ministry of the twelve apostles is there shining in its beautiful spiritual value.<a name=463:10></a> Then, further, there is a street of gold - there is nothing unclean there.<a name=463:11></a> Then think of the greatness of the food supply - the tree of life - it is in the city itself, it is not imported; and the water supply, that also comes from within, not from a reservoir far away.<a name=463:12></a> It is the water of life.<a name=463:13></a> Then there is the glorious lighting system: "The glory of God has enlightened it, and the lamp thereof is the Lamb"

		There is one other corporate aspect which I desire to bring before you, and that is the military aspect.<a name=464:6></a> It is a united thought.<a name=464:7></a> In Numbers, when all the tribes were round the tabernacle, and when they marched off in beautiful order and precision under their standards, one great army provided for every eventuality.<a name=464:8></a> So now, the assembly has always been militant and always will be while here on earth.<a name=464:9></a> It is a host of which there is only one Captain - the Captain of Jehovah's host.<a name=464:10></a> There may be rebellious soldiers, but the army goes on to victory.<a name=464:11></a> You ask, 'What is their uniform?<a name=464:12></a>' You will find their armour described in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#6">Ephesians  6</a>, and every member of that army should have that uniform.<a name=464:13></a> We are told to take the panoply of God and, in keeping with the Ephesian epistle, each soldier forms part of a vast system.<a name=464:14></a> When it comes to the time that the armies of heaven emerge, following the One on a white horse, they are not said to be clothed in that armour, for the days of trial are over; they are sitting on white horses clothed in white linen.<a name=464:15></a> All the armies of heaven are there, for there are other armies, and other saints, who will come out with Christ, but the assembly army - if I may so speak - is not then clothed in the armour of Ephesians, but in white linen, pure and fine.<a name=464:16></a> She comes out with Christ as a

		spectator and participator in the great victory, but it is as an army, and we do well to remember it.<a name=465:1></a> We cannot rest on our oars now; if we are soldiers we must attend to our business, as Paul says to Timothy, "No one going as a soldier entangles himself with the affairs of life" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#2:4">2 Timothy  2:4</a>).<a name=465:2></a> It does not mean that you are not to be a carpenter, or a shopkeeper, but you must not engage in anything that would prevent military service in this spiritual conflict.<a name=465:3></a> If there are rebels or disorders, let us stand by our colours and go on, because we shall surely be victorious.<a name=465:4></a>

		That is in substance what I wanted to bring before you, but I will just add that there will be a wonderful dissolving view at the end; the holy city comes down from heaven, but the next time you look at it, it is a tabernacle.<a name=465:5></a> John says, "I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21:2">Revelation  21:2</a>), and then the loud voice out of heaven says, "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he shall tabernacle with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, their God" (verse 3).<a name=465:6></a> That is a more intimate thought; it is the final aspect of the assembly as the tabernacle of God.<a name=465:7></a> What a wonderful eternal thought that is, heaven and earth in perfect accord, and God tabernacling with men.<a name=465:8></a>

		I would just add that the whole thing is instinct with life.<a name=465:9></a> I have omitted some aspects which were touched on yesterday, in regard to the flock, and the children of God gathered into one.<a name=465:10></a> These are necessary to complete the subject, but the point is that they are all living - these thoughts are all living.<a name=465:11></a> Christ is the Son of the <i>living</i> God;

		and the sons in the house are all living sons.<a name=466:1></a> Then in regard to the flock, life permeates it; Christ gives them life, and gives it very abundantly.<a name=466:2></a> So the whole is characterised by life; the body is an organism, not an organisation; it is full of life - living in every part of it.<a name=466:3></a> Then another great feature connected with this corporate idea is love; you find love everywhere; it permeates the whole system; it is connected with the body, with the flock, and with the children; there is nothing that I have mentioned where love is not present - even in the military aspect.<a name=466:4></a> All this beautiful collection of ideas is permeated by these two features - love and life.<a name=466:5></a> They are not mere abstract ideas to be cherished in our minds, and not carried out; on the contrary, they are very concrete thoughts, and as far as possible, without attempting to set up anything - any human organisation - we may be true to these ideas and live in them and by them.<a name=466:6></a> It is a wonderful region of life and love.<a name=466:7></a> May the Lord bless His word!<a name=466:8></a>
