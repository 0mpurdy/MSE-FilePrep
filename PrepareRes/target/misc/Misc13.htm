		One's desire is to say a few words about fellowship.<a name=1:2></a> This will be a subject well-known, no doubt, to many here, a fundamental subject too, but always of importance to us as Christians, because, if we are enjoying Christianity as we should, we would be enjoying fellowship in some measure.<a name=1:3></a> God would have us enjoy a full measure of it in so far as we can enter into it in these closing days of the church's history here.<a name=1:4></a>

		What the Holy Spirit brought here at Pentecost He still holds for the whole assembly, for all God's people; He has not dropped one feature of it.<a name=1:5></a> Like the servant who came to secure Rebecca, He has all the treasure of His Master under His hand (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24:10">Genesis  24:10</a>).<a name=1:6></a> The Holy Spirit came here with all the wealth of heaven behind Him, the wealth of the Father and of the Son, and brought all that fulness down to fill the church and the hearts of God's people until the Lord would come for them again.<a name=1:7></a> Nothing of that fulness has gone back to heaven; it is still here in the Spirit's keeping that you and I might have access to it.<a name=1:8></a>

		One of the great things that the Spirit is in charge of is fellowship, the fellowship of the saints.<a name=1:9></a> We have read about it in three connections, first as experienced by the saints at the beginning where it is called the "fellowship of the apostles"; then Paul,

		coming on the scene later, opened out the matter further, and he refers to it in writing to Corinth as the fellowship of God's Son.<a name=2:1></a> But John, writing for days of breakdown, is very unofficial and he just speaks of how in certain conditions "we have fellowship with one another".<a name=2:2></a> That is the real thing.<a name=2:3></a> Now the apostle Paul, writing to the Philippians, speaks of this as the fellowship of the Spirit (<a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#2:1">Philippians  2:1</a>); again, writing to the Corinthians he speaks of the communion (or fellowship) of the Holy Spirit (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#13:14">2 Corinthians  13:14</a>).<a name=2:4></a> He also speaks of it as the fellowship of Christ's blood and the fellowship of Christ's body (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10:16">1 Corinthians  10:16</a>).<a name=2:5></a> All these give us various aspects of the one thing.<a name=2:6></a>

		It was never the intention of the blessed God in taking up poor sinners to leave them lonely and isolated.<a name=2:7></a> The psalmist could say, "God maketh the solitary into families" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#68:6">Psalm  68:6</a>).<a name=2:8></a> It is very good of God to think of men in that way, that they should have happy, profitable associations down here in the midst of a wicked world, and that there should be a great association of life, not of the world, but in the midst of it, a circle enjoying eternal life and in touch with heaven.<a name=2:9></a> That is God's plan for every saint at the present time; they should be enjoying the portion of the saints in light, delivered from the authority of darkness, from Satan's power, from the power of the world, and be brought into the bundle of the living where they can enjoy a heavenly portion.<a name=2:10></a> It is the greatest company that you could be found in, the fellowship of the Spirit.<a name=2:11></a> It is energised by the Holy

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now at the beginning of this dispensation it was a very obvious fellowship.<a name=3:3></a> Where we read in the Acts there was no church breakdown; there were no sects, there were no divisions and there was no scattering of God's people.<a name=3:4></a> All were together and had all things common.<a name=3:5></a> "Not one said that anything of what he possessed was his own".<a name=3:6></a> All their material resources were available for the good of the whole company, the whole fellowship; and that was quite apart from the world.<a name=3:7></a> It was not a heathen organisation; it was not a Jewish organisation.<a name=3:8></a> It was completely different from all that men had experienced before, and it was greatly favoured in having Christ's companions serving it.<a name=3:9></a> That is an important point.<a name=3:10></a> These early converts "persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles".<a name=3:11></a> They had been converted through Peter's preaching; he preached repentance and baptism, and they had responded.<a name=3:12></a> They were all baptised "and there were added in that day about three thousand souls" (chapter 2: 41).<a name=3:13></a> That is, they had accepted death to the world and to the whole sin system; they had committed themselves to a rejected yet glorified Christ and they were added to the assembly; they were added to what God had here, what the Spirit anointed on the day of Pentecost.<a name=3:14></a>

		the pull of Judaism, that ancient tradition they had been born into and brought up with.<a name=4:1></a> God had originated what they were identified with, though it had greatly deteriorated in the hands of men.<a name=4:2></a> The scribes and Pharisees and the corrupt priesthood had ruined what God originally set up.<a name=4:3></a> Nevertheless, the Lord identified Himself with His earthly people, though, at that time, the recovery of Nehemiah's and Ezra's day had long since broken down; it had become an order of things that was all profession, outward rites and rituals, but lacking heart, lacking reality and which eventually rejected the Son of God Himself.<a name=4:4></a> So He had to say, "your house is left unto you desolate" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#23:38">Matthew  23:38</a>).<a name=4:5></a>

		But what has encouraged me in looking at the gospels is that the greatest things that ever men saw or heard were brought out in the midst of a ruined revival.<a name=4:6></a> That is the background, as to context, of the life of Jesus as seen in the gospels.<a name=4:7></a> That recovery from Babylon was effective under Zerubbabel and Ezra and Nehemiah and the prophets, Haggai and Zechariah, but it had become corrupted and ruined by man, so that in Malachi's time they would not even shut the doors of the temple without payment (<a href="../bible/Malachi.htm#1:10">Malachi  1:10</a>).<a name=4:8></a> They brought the blind and the lame to offer to God, things they would not give their governor.<a name=4:9></a> The law was broken on every hand; unfaithful against the wife of their youth, they broke the covenant that God had made with them.<a name=4:10></a> But there was a remnant of the Spirit.<a name=4:11></a> "The remnant of the Spirit was his" (<a href="../bible/Malachi.htm#2:15">Malachi  2:15</a>), and the Spirit

		looked after that remnant right till Jesus came in.<a name=5:1></a> It appears in the gospels in Anna and Simeon and those who waited for redemption in Jerusalem, Joseph and Mary, Zacharias and Elizabeth, the godly remnant of the Spirit.<a name=5:2></a> Jesus appears in the midst of them and as He grows up, and takes up His ministry, He calls others to Him, and there is a little remnant following Him, loyal to Him in the days of His flesh, in the midst of which He brings out the greatest things that earth could ever have known.<a name=5:3></a> The full revelation of God came out in the midst of a ruined recovery.<a name=5:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So let us not be discouraged, dear brethren.<a name=5:5></a> We live in days when a wonderful recovery has been ruined, broken up, split and fragmented all over the earth.<a name=5:6></a> We are not to be discouraged.<a name=5:7></a> It was in moral conditions like that that the full revelation of God was brought out.<a name=5:8></a> All that man could know was brought out and portrayed in the Son of God, and God's purpose made known that men might be in sonship with Him.<a name=5:9></a> The glory His Father gave Him He gave to the men whom the Father had given Him out of the world (<a href="../bible/John.htm#17:6">John  17:6</a>, 22).<a name=5:10></a> So let us be prepared for great things in the day of brokenness in which we live, because the Spirit, as I remarked at the outset, has retained all that He brought from heaven.<a name=5:11></a>

		Well, these people were part of a fellowship that was distinct from all around in the pagan world and in the religious world, and it was marked out by heavenly character.<a name=5:12></a> The whole stream of life was

		against them; all the traditions were being cut across.<a name=6:1></a> Jerusalem would have been full of their relatives and full of their religion, having many synagogues and the temple; but it says "they persevered".<a name=6:2></a> That is what we need, perseverance.<a name=6:3></a> There is much against us today too.<a name=6:4></a> Are we going to give up and fold our arms like the sluggard in Proverbs?<a name=6:5></a> We shall find ourselves impoverished.<a name=6:6></a> "So shall thy poverty come as a roving plunderer, and thy penury as an armed man" (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#6:11">Proverbs  6:11</a>).<a name=6:7></a> We do not want to be robbed of our inheritance, beloved.<a name=6:8></a> Let us persevere, let us hold fast what we have that no one take our crown.<a name=6:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have known what it was to have had many other burdens laid upon us, unprofitable burdens.<a name=6:10></a> The Lord's mind is, "I do not cast upon you any other burden; but what ye have hold fast" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2:24">Revelation  2:24</a>, 25) -- and we have much, through grace; much has been recovered to us.<a name=6:11></a> We have been blessed with wonderful blessing, wonderful light and truth.<a name=6:12></a> Oh!<a name=6:13></a> to be true to it, and to be exhibitors of it.<a name=6:14></a> The testimony is only preserved in those who are the exponents of it.<a name=6:15></a> The testimony is not on the book-shelves or in the libraries; it is in the personnel, the saints, who have God's mind and are walking according to it.<a name=6:16></a> So "they persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles".<a name=6:17></a> That would be no easy matter because the apostles' standards would be very high; they would be no less than Christ's standards.<a name=6:18></a> These men would give colour and character to the fellowship that made it the quality that it was.<a name=6:19></a>

		fellowship go together.<a name=7:1></a> We can have this because the Spirit is still here.<a name=7:2></a> We do not have apostles now, but the apostles' fellowship in character would still be here.<a name=7:3></a> The youngest brother who preaches the truth will have divine authority behind him because he is speaking God's mind.<a name=7:4></a> How else could you preach the gospel if you could not get up with certainty and ask never-dying souls to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and be saved?<a name=7:5></a> You speak with divine authority, otherwise your audience may say, 'That is just his opinion'.<a name=7:6></a> No, the youngest believer who is preaching Christ and God's gospel is preaching with divine authority.<a name=7:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, this was a very wonderful fellowship and what they did in it was governed by this heavenly teaching, and it was a safe fellowship.<a name=7:8></a> The apostles were there to protect them from false teaching and false practice.<a name=7:9></a> Then Satan sought to infiltrate deception through Ananias and Sapphira.<a name=7:10></a> Peter was quick to discern it and to protect the company from that evil.<a name=7:11></a> What a solemn event occurred in the death of that couple!<a name=7:12></a> God asserted Himself for the protection of the holiness of His house and the integrity of the fellowship into which He had called His people.<a name=7:13></a>

		It says also, "They persevered .<a name=7:14></a>.<a name=7:15></a>.<a name=7:16></a> in breaking of bread and prayers".<a name=7:17></a> I think it is a wonderfully balanced situation here; the teaching and fellowship, and then the breaking of bread and prayers.<a name=7:18></a> We need to keep on with the breaking of bread.<a name=7:19></a> One thing I feel I need more than anything is the breaking of

		bread, the Lord's supper, what He has asked us to do.<a name=8:1></a> "This do in remembrance of me" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22:19">Luke  22:19</a>).<a name=8:2></a> How can any Christian really do without that for very long?<a name=8:3></a> Some have had to do without it for quite a while on account of circumstances, but I believe that a true lover of the Lord, truly exercised, would not be left very long without the Lord's supper.<a name=8:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us persevere, beloved brethren, and not give it up easily.<a name=8:5></a> And the prayers are needful for us to be kept dependent.<a name=8:6></a> Pray for ourselves and households, for the saints and all God's interests here.<a name=8:7></a> What a wide range of interests there is to go over in our thoughts and prayers!<a name=8:8></a> Keep at it.<a name=8:9></a> The devil would have us give up.<a name=8:10></a> When you give up prayers you are on the danger list.<a name=8:11></a> The prayers make way for divine power to maintain us in life and in victory.<a name=8:12></a> That is why this company continued in such buoyancy and with such a sense of well-being.<a name=8:13></a> What quality and wholesomeness marked them so long as they maintained these features!<a name=8:14></a> When they were given up, failure came in, alas.<a name=8:15></a>

		"Fear was upon every soul".<a name=8:16></a> Not that they were afraid of God or afraid of the apostles; that is not the idea.<a name=8:17></a> I do not think Peter or John would induce fear in people.<a name=8:18></a> No, this is holy fear of God, fear of offending the blessed God.<a name=8:19></a> I believe the most happy intimate relations existed between the apostles and the brethren.<a name=8:20></a> I do not think the apostles used the rod in their teaching of God's people.<a name=8:21></a> If you read the Acts you can see what intimate, affectionate relationships prevailed between the apostles and the

		saints.<a name=9:1></a> The service was carried on in the most respectful way; the saints were respected and the teachers were respected.<a name=9:2></a> There was mutual respect and mutual love amongst the brethren but no mutual fear or mutual antipathy.<a name=9:3></a> This was a real fellowship.<a name=9:4></a>

		"Many wonders and signs took place through the apostles' means.<a name=9:5></a> And all that believed were together, and had all things common".<a name=9:6></a> I think the Spirit records this for us to show the beautiful state of things in simplicity at the beginning.<a name=9:7></a> It speaks of them here receiving "their food with gladness and simplicity of heart".<a name=9:8></a> Every day they were "constantly in the temple with one accord"; I do not think that they were in there engaged in Jewish worship.<a name=9:9></a> This is in the general temple buildings (see footnote d).<a name=9:10></a> They preached there; you find the priests laying hands upon them there for their preaching (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#4:3">Acts  4:3</a>).<a name=9:11></a> But they are there "with one accord"; they are inwardly in agreement; their hearts are knit and they are praising God and are in favour with all the people, and the Lord was pleased to add.<a name=9:12></a> Now if we could just recover in some measure some of those conditions, do you not think the Lord would be pleased to entrust others to such a company?<a name=9:13></a> That is a safe company, the best company on earth to be committed to; and the Lord was pleased to add the subjects of His mercy daily.<a name=9:14></a>

		I just added those verses in chapter 4 as showing how this thing had been continued for some time; "the heart and soul of the multitude of those that had believed were one".<a name=9:15></a> Oh!<a name=9:16></a> what unity.<a name=9:17></a> The Spirit

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now we do not have that today; we could not go out and witness as the apostles did because all we can point to publicly is a broken church.<a name=10:12></a> We have often said, If a Chinaman came in and got converted, where would you send him?<a name=10:13></a> Where would you tell him to go, if he wanted christian company?<a name=10:14></a> The only thing you can do (as for yourself also) is to send him to the Lord and say, 'Go to Him; He is the only One who can direct you'.<a name=10:15></a> He gives you inward direction, inward leading.<a name=10:16></a> When you get that you are safe.<a name=10:17></a> If you have not got it you will always be unsteady, uncertain and unstable.<a name=10:18></a> The apostles could point to a

		Now in Paul we have the wise architect of the church.<a name=11:4></a> To him it was given to complete the word of God.<a name=11:5></a> The twelve had learned a great deal from Christ; they were a wonderful repository of truth but they did not have it all.<a name=11:6></a> Paul was brought in to complete the revelation (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#1:25">Colossians  1:25</a>), to bring in the topstone of all that God would have us understand of His will, His mind and His purpose.<a name=11:7></a> Paul brings in the truth of the mystery, and opens up the heavenly calling, the truth of sonship, and the service of God, and he shows the workings of the house of God in the most remarkable manner; he shows what the fellowship of God's Son really ought to be; he gives it this beautiful title.<a name=11:8></a> He is writing to a company much beloved of him; he had laboured there for many months and there had been real results, a large number secured for the testimony.<a name=11:9></a> The testimony of the Christ was confirmed in them and they came short in no gift; they were awaiting the Lord's coming.<a name=11:10></a> But the devil had got to work and brought in sects amongst them, schools of opinion.<a name=11:11></a> "Each of you says, <i>I</i> am of Paul, and <i>I</i> of Apollos, and <i>I</i> of Cephas, and <i>I</i> of Christ" (verse 12).<a name=11:12></a> They were breaking bread in the same locality.<a name=11:13></a> All had chosen favourites whom they followed.<a name=11:14></a> Paul says they are ordinary men, and the Corinthians were following men.<a name=11:15></a> "Has

		It is scarcely necessary to state that if there are many and blessed privileges known by believers as constituting the house of God, there are at the same time corresponding responsibilities.<a name=20:2></a> In our last paper we considered some of the privileges, in this paper the responsibilities will be before us.<a name=20:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The epistle which particularly deals with this side of the subject is 1 Timothy.<a name=20:4></a> The behaviour suited to the house of God is there dwelt upon.<a name=20:5></a> It is doubtful if we shall answer to the responsibilities attaching to the house of God unless we enjoy something of the privileges.<a name=20:6></a> And, on the other hand, if we do not answer to the responsibilities we shall become dull in our spiritual sensibilities and incapable of enjoying our privileges.<a name=20:7></a> Both sides must be maintained.<a name=20:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The conduct insisted upon in the first epistle addressed to Timothy supposes the doctrine and the privileges of the epistle to the Ephesians.<a name=20:9></a> Ephesians gives us the inward spiritual relationships and privileges more particularly, while 1 Timothy insists upon the maintenance of right behaviour.<a name=20:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle Paul, in writing to his trusted, but apparently young, servant, Timothy, gives certain instructions as to detail, and concludes these remarks by saying that he wrote thus that Timothy might know how one ought to behave oneself in the house of God (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#3:15">1 Timothy  3:15</a>).<a name=20:11></a> Hence we may rightly turn to

	<div class="paragraph">
		such an epistle to learn what is the suitable behaviour to those who compose the house of God.<a name=21:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(1) The "end", or desideratum, of what is brought before us is "love out of a pure heart and a good conscience and unfeigned faith" (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#1:5">1 Timothy  1:5</a>).<a name=21:2></a> Moreover, Timothy is exhorted to maintain "faith, and a good conscience" (verse 19).<a name=21:3></a> Some had swerved from this state of soul, even in the early days of Timothy's time, and consequently departure of a more serious kind followed.<a name=21:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The standard by which all has to be judged today is the "sound teaching, according to the glad tidings of the blessed God" (verse 11).<a name=21:5></a> God has been revealed, and by this revelation and in the presence of God we answer to His mind and possess these essential qualities -- love, a good conscience and faith.<a name=21:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Love is the divine nature; a good conscience can only be kept as our conduct answers to what we know to be right; faith is that which gives the enjoyment of the light of the revelation of God.<a name=21:7></a> In our experience these qualities would possibly come in the reverse order.<a name=21:8></a> Faith is the light of revelation in the soul; conscience regulates conduct accordingly; and, our hearts being thus morally purified, we love God who first loved us.<a name=21:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may rest assured that these qualities are of immense importance.<a name=21:10></a> They are the foundation <i>in the soul</i> of all practical Christianity.<a name=21:11></a> They are the outcome of what is revealed to us by God and of His work in our souls, and are the moral basis of all right practice.<a name=21:12></a>

		We feel persuaded that all departure has its beginning in a defect in one or more of these moral qualities.<a name=22:1></a> Unless faith is in exercise, the soul is practically in darkness; if our consciences are not kept sensitive and good, we shall fail to answer to the light we have; love is the response in man to God.<a name=22:2></a> It is useless to consider anything further if these primary and essential elements are wanting.<a name=22:3></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		(2) In the house of God His attitude towards man is set forth in a practical way.<a name=22:4></a> Those who form the dwelling place of God are exhorted to have a prayerful interest in men.<a name=22:5></a> Hence the love and grace of God, who is known as Saviour, are manifested.<a name=22:6></a> <i>How can we pray for people we do not love</i>?<a name=22:7></a> Our hearts will condemn us if we assume to do so.<a name=22:8></a> But in the enjoyment of God's love, our hearts are filled with love to men<a href="#22:f1"><sup class="footnote-link">+</sup></a>, and we pray for them.<a name=22:9></a>

		There is a tendency for us to stop short; we may think of being divinely taken up as being merely for ourselves, that we should be freed from all that rested upon us; but the more we look into it, taking into account types from Genesis onwards, we shall find that in all God's dealings in relation to men, every provision made for them, is that they might be available to Him for His satisfaction and joy.<a name=27:2></a> Before man had any thoughts at all, God purposed to bring him into being; to set him up on the earth, a scene got ready, suitable for him, that he might be here wholly for the pleasure of God.<a name=27:3></a> Man fell; but God was not defeated in His eternal thoughts, but showed that He could secure His desires in relation to men.<a name=27:4></a> This involved the death of His beloved Son.<a name=27:5></a>

		I read this scripture with regard to Abraham, because I think it will exercise us, and adjust us, that we may be kept steady in the path of faith.<a name=27:6></a> Abraham stands out as one who had a special place with God; in fact, he is the first one to whom God indicated what His purpose of blessing was for men.<a name=27:7></a> In connection with Eve and Noah, God showed that man could be recovered; but to Abraham He disclosed His purpose for men.<a name=27:8></a> How necessary it is for us to be established in regard to God's purpose for us.<a name=27:9></a> What I mean is, that we should see there is something <i>more</i> needed for us than to be merely moving here as having links with God, on the side of what is pious.<a name=27:10></a> We shall see, I trust, that it is necessary for us to have our desires and hearts fixed

		We find Abraham here as one called of God, told to go out of his country, etc.<a name=28:2></a>, and to move into that land which God would show him.<a name=28:3></a> Abraham moved in faith, he left his country; he made a move in accordance with God's purposes for him; God disclosed His mind with regard to him, gave him light as to the position, and Abraham moved in relation to it.<a name=28:4></a> What one was struck with in reading the scripture is that Abraham was impressed, as we often speak, only in an objective way; he followed up in faith what God had presented, he moved into the land and set up an altar -- he committed himself wholly to the position; but what is seen is that Abraham <i>passed on</i> -- it was not a question of <i>abiding in</i> the land, he moved through it.<a name=28:5></a> He took account of all God's purposes for him, as far as light was concerned; but what comes after is this, that although he was severed from all that held him previously, he <i>moved</i> on southward -- he was not wholly occupied with that which God had presented to him.<a name=28:6></a>

		How many of us talk about the purpose of God?<a name=28:7></a> The apostle Paul had two prayers on behalf of the Ephesian saints; first it was that they might be brought to view objectively that which was in accord with God's purpose, including the wonderful position which God had purposed for the saints (chapter 1: 15 - 23).<a name=28:8></a> But his second prayer (chapter 3: 14 - 19) was that there might be that produced and formed in them which would answer to it, that they might be

		Now that is what one is endeavouring to show in regard to Abraham.<a name=29:4></a> You see the necessity.<a name=29:5></a> We often have the things in the way of light and talk about purpose, of things we look forward to, all eternally established on the basis of the blood-shedding of Christ; but how much are we entering into it at the present moment, how much are we formed by it as those who live in it, those that form that wondrous company, that vessel that had been purposed in eternity?<a name=29:6></a> How much are we available in regard to it, so that there is going up to the blessed God, even now, that which is for His satisfaction and joy?<a name=29:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What can be acceptable if it does not spring from love?<a name=31:4></a> The Lord Jesus Himself was the Antitype of the Hebrew servant who said "I love" (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#21:5">Exodus  21:5</a>), and this is the secret of every true sacrificial service.<a name=31:5></a> "Beloved, if God has so loved us, we also ought to love one another" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:11">1 John  4:11</a>).<a name=31:6></a> Love finds expression in service.<a name=31:7></a> How the Lord Jesus has served His assembly in love!<a name=31:8></a>

		What is in mind, beloved brethren, is to speak, with the help of the Holy Spirit, of divine reserves, the provision God has made in view of the maintenance of the testimony.<a name=33:1></a> But these scriptures speak of what is special; they refer to what is additional in the way of resource that God brings in, in order to meet need as it arises.<a name=33:2></a> God has committed Himself to the continuance of the testimony according to the standards that marked it when He set it on, and these scriptures, I trust, will serve to bring that out.<a name=33:3></a>

		The idea of holding things in reserve is not a new one with God.<a name=34:3></a> He spoke of it to Job, saying, "Hast thou entered into the storehouses of the snow, and hast thou seen the treasuries of the hail, which I have reserved for the time of distress, for the day of battle and war?<a name=34:4></a>" (<a href="../bible/Job.htm#38:22">Job  38:22</a>, 23).<a name=34:5></a> God has great reserves, held in abeyance at the moment, in view of judgment.<a name=34:6></a> But that is not my theme.<a name=34:7></a> The thought is that God has in His mind and heart just what is needed to meet the current conditions in the testimony.<a name=34:8></a>

		Well, God meets that.<a name=35:14></a> What a gracious God we have to do with, who would take us up and sustain us in the testimony, passing us through tests as He sees fit, as it is His sovereign right to do, and yet sustaining us.<a name=35:15></a> Think of how the blessed God condescended to meet the exercises of this devoted servant: "and behold, at his head was a cake, baked

		AGUR'S REFLECTIONS

	<div class="paragraph">
		P. Lyon

	<div class="paragraph">
		<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#30:1">Proverbs  30:1</a> - 4, 18 - 20
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have in mind, dear brethren, to follow up the inquiry of Agur as leading up to four things which he describes as too wonderful for him, for I believe they may be taken to illustrate certain features of the truth discernible in our day.<a name=52:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Agur's name means 'a gatherer', that is to say, he is not a man with mere academic questions; he seeks a divine answer to his inquiries.<a name=52:2></a> He has in his search an eye for gold; he is a noble Berean in that way (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#17:11">Acts  17:11</a>).<a name=52:3></a> And then he finds others with whom to pursue his inquiries.<a name=52:4></a> Ithiel is said to mean 'God is', and Ucal, 'God will prevail'.<a name=52:5></a> You can well understand that persons marked by the faith implied in the names of these men will furnish the suited atmosphere for the unfolding of the mind of God through prophetic channels as indicated in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#14">1 Corinthians  14</a>.<a name=52:6></a> So that, as in that chapter, the man coming in will own "that God is among you of a truth" (verse 25).<a name=52:7></a> Agur is content to unfold what he has gathered to two persons, and God helps him; for we are moving on figuratively towards the crowning issue of all true ministry, namely Christ and the assembly, as suggested in the husband and his wife, the virtuous woman, of the next chapter.<a name=52:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Agur pursues his inquiry in lowly and comely feelings; "Truly <i>I</i> am more stupid than any one; and I have not a man's intelligence.<a name=52:9></a> I have neither learned wisdom, nor have I the knowledge of the

		Holy".<a name=53:1></a> How wholesome are these sentiments, for if we are lacking in this essential feature of humility we shall be equally bereft of the substance God delights to give to the humble.<a name=53:2></a> To such a one taking thus his place in the lowest room, the Lord would say, as in Luke, "Friend, go up higher" (chapter 14: 10).<a name=53:3></a> Such a spirit of acknowledged weakness, seen also in Paul as weak among the Corinthians, is calculated to awaken inquiry and support with those who are of the generation of faith, and thus the very lowliness of this speaker but invites the greater attention, on the part of those of kindred mind, to the wealth which he has gathered.<a name=53:4></a> Such are not slow to detect the divine credentials found with a true servant of the Lord, who is marked by the meek and lowly spirit of his Master.<a name=53:5></a> Thus Agur, and those with him, may be likened to the element of temple inquiry in which alone we get divine help as we look into the truth together.<a name=53:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We come now to verse 4: "Who hath ascended up into the heavens, and descended?<a name=53:7></a>" This would refer to the Lord Jesus.<a name=53:8></a> He ascended far above all heavens to fill all things.<a name=53:9></a> He has gone up in the majesty and dignity of His Person.<a name=53:10></a> He has ascended, but He also descended.<a name=53:11></a> In what love He went up, but then in what love He went down, even into death and into the lower parts of the earth, in that dignity which alone could be His as He went forth bearing His cross!<a name=53:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we read, "Who hath gathered the wind in his fists?<a name=53:13></a>" The wind in this scripture no doubt would

		refer to the power of the enemy, but then, what power there is with the Lord!<a name=54:1></a> The enemy raises storms, but in His fists the Lord holds the winds.<a name=54:2></a> This is exemplified on the Lake of Galilee when He said "Peace, be still" (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#4:39">Mark  4:39</a>, Authorised Version), and there was a great calm.<a name=54:3></a> Then again how the Lord in His death bound the waters of death in a garment!<a name=54:4></a> Also it says, "Who hath established all the ends of the earth?<a name=54:5></a> What is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou knowest?<a name=54:6></a>" You can well see that there is a veiled reference here to God's great operations of divine love and power universally, as given effect to by the Son of His love -- His going up in majesty and dignity, His coming down in infinite love, and the power now that is His in regard to the winds blowing against His people.<a name=54:7></a> He has bound the waters in a garment, the garment conveying the thought of the Lord in manhood, having the mastery over death, as binding its waters.<a name=54:8></a> How engaging are His movements among us in this character on the first day of the week!<a name=54:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How various are the features in this chapter which come under the thoughtful consideration of this inquirer!<a name=54:10></a> He is an observer marked by the knowledge born of reflection, and thus given to spiritual thoughtfulness.<a name=54:11></a> His audience may be small numerically, because what is casual and superficial easily catches the popular ear, while the depth of feeling which attaches to spiritual thoughtfulness is at a discount in Christendom.<a name=54:12></a> This but adds value to the presence of those two listeners, challenging us as

		they do as to whether we are of their company.<a name=55:1></a> If there are two of such the Lord may be pleased to add more, and we would covet to be among them.<a name=55:2></a> How necessary is this spirit of discernment between good or evil if we are to have our living part, as in the next chapter, in the understanding and pursuit of what is good as seen in the virtuous woman, who, as commanding the confidence of her husband, does him good and not evil all the days of her life!<a name=55:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Think of the value, too, in heaven's sight, of a life devoted to doing good to the Lord Jesus.<a name=55:4></a> Perhaps one here may say, 'I set aside the Lord's Day wherein to do the Lord good', but which of our few and brief remaining days can we afford to let pass devoid of this service of love to Him?<a name=55:5></a> Let us give Him daily something positive and refreshing to His heart and the heart of the blessed God.<a name=55:6></a> Then we shall not lack in serving love to others.<a name=55:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In regard to the second scripture, Agur comes to what is too wonderful for him.<a name=55:8></a> He has under-standing, but now he comes to something that is beyond him; and there is a reason for that, for he belongs to an earlier economy, and has not the knowledge of who this wonderful Person is.<a name=55:9></a> John, although emphasising the inscrutability of the Person, presents Him in the first chapter of his gospel as the Word become flesh.<a name=55:10></a> And then he presents Him as the ascending One in the twentieth chapter, and as the descending One in those wonderful chapters 13 to 18, treading love's glorious way into death.<a name=55:11></a>

		John's ministry, as that of the other apostles also, would enable us to see that these things are not too wonderful for us; wonderful they are, but not too wonderful; that is, as having the Spirit indwelling us in liberty, we have some understanding of what this means.<a name=56:1></a> The Lord would not make things easy to the spiritual inquirer, for He intends to promote with him diligent search as with those of old at Berea, who thus acquired nobility in the view of heaven (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#17:11">Acts  17:11</a>).<a name=56:2></a> "It is the glory of God to conceal a thing; but the glory of kings is to search out a thing" (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#25:2">Proverbs  25:2</a>).<a name=56:3></a> There is what has come to us in the simplicity of the Gospel, but then love is tested in following up matters in thoughtful and diligent temple inquiry and appropriation.<a name=56:4></a>

		The Lord Jesus, as a blessed Man, has in the assembly that which is for Himself.<a name=65:2></a> My desire is to occupy us with what the assembly is to the Lord Jesus, because I believe she is foremost in His heart's affection, the one for whom He has given Himself.<a name=65:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#13">Matthew  13</a>, the Lord Jesus is presented as "a merchant seeking beautiful pearls", a Man who knew the value of that for which He was looking, and He finds "one pearl of great value".<a name=65:4></a> I would like us to consider the value of the assembly to the Lord Jesus.<a name=65:5></a> Value is not a matter of price; it is what an object is to the one who has it, or who desires it.<a name=65:6></a> He "found one pearl of great value" -- in type, the assembly -- and He expressed what that value was to Himself by the price that He was prepared to pay for it: "he went and sold all whatever he had and bought it".<a name=65:7></a> Do you appreciate that the Lord Jesus has paid a tremendous price to secure the assembly for Himself?<a name=65:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul tells us that "the Christ also loved the assembly and has delivered himself up for it" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:25">Ephesians  5:25</a>); and he exhorted the elders of Ephesus to "shepherd the assembly of God, which he has purchased with the blood of his own" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20:28">Acts  20:28</a>).<a name=65:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=66>[Page 66]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The purchase price was the blood of One who before God was perfect and who had fully satisfied His heart.<a name=66:1></a> He has bought it; the rights to it belong to Him; it is precious to Him.<a name=66:2></a> The assembly should become more precious to us as we appreciate how precious she is to the Lord.<a name=66:3></a> It is important that each one of us gets a richer and fuller appreciation of the value that Christ has of His assembly, and that should help us to be more faithful to the Lord Jesus at the present time, and enhance our valuation of one another as those who have part in what Christ has secured for Himself.<a name=66:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Where we read in <a href="../bible/1Samuel.htm#25">1 Samuel  25</a>, the day is very similar to the one in which we live; David was in rejection.<a name=66:5></a> Samuel had died, Saul was thinking only of himself, and those that had come under the benefit and influence of David, typically, Christ, did not appreciate him.<a name=66:6></a> "Who is David?<a name=66:7></a>" Nabal says (verse 10), and yet Nabal's young men could testify to the kindness of David's messengers (verses 14 - 17).<a name=66:8></a> We live in a land where much benefit has accrued to men as a result of the Person and the work of the Lord Jesus, and yet it is not much appreciated.<a name=66:9></a> Against that background, there was this woman Abigail who was "of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance" (verse 4).<a name=66:10></a> She was a woman of discernment, and, in contrast to Nabal, she knew who David was, and she knew God's thoughts in relation to him: "the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living with Jehovah thy God" (verse 29).<a name=66:11></a> She knew that David was going to be king.<a name=66:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		At the present time, the assembly too is to be marked by discernment, and understanding that Christ is going to reign supreme.<a name=67:1></a> So there is to be an answer at the present time among those who are prepared to be associated with Him in His rejection, and to be a present comfort to Him.<a name=67:2></a> I would like to encourage each of us to contribute to what is a present comfort to the heart of the Lord Jesus.<a name=67:3></a> May there be in our hearts a greater appreciation of what He is in the sight of God, and let us be identified with Him, and separate from this world where He has been rejected.<a name=67:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		David appreciated the features that marked Abigail.<a name=67:5></a> No doubt her beauty was very attractive, but what was particularly precious to David was that she was prepared to minister to him and to his men.<a name=67:6></a> That, I think, is what we are called to do at the present time, beloved: to be prepared to minister to the Lord Jesus and to His people.<a name=67:7></a> Maybe we need to sacrifice in order that the saints might be served, to go on in subjection and humility, prepared to be here for the Lord Jesus.<a name=67:8></a> This is not just something that is individual; there is to be a united response from the hearts of the saints to the Lord Jesus.<a name=67:9></a> It is particularly when the saints are together that they afford this present comfort to the heart of Christ.<a name=67:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So it says very simply as to Abigail that she "went after the messengers of David, and became his wife".<a name=67:11></a> What a comfort a wife is!<a name=67:12></a> David here, typical of the Lord Jesus, had one in whom he can confide.<a name=67:13></a> The assembly today is to be considering for Christ

		In the Song of Songs we come to what is peculiarly precious, "my spouse" suggesting the assembly as the companion of Christ in secret communion.<a name=68:3></a> What delight He has in this companion!<a name=68:4></a> How precious the assembly is in His sight!<a name=68:5></a> You think of the beautiful features that are portrayed here: "Thou art all fair, my love; and there is no spot in thee".<a name=68:6></a> She is of Himself and like Himself and is for Himself, and there is nothing in her that is unsuited to this blessed Man.<a name=68:7></a> As typifying the Lord's appreciation of the assembly, that is something that we can enjoy particularly as gathered together at the Supper on the first day of the week.<a name=68:8></a> You will remember that it says of Isaac that he led Rebecca "into his mother Sarah's tent .<a name=68:9></a>.<a name=68:10></a>.<a name=68:11></a> and she became his wife, and he loved her" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#24:67">Genesis  24:67</a>), suggesting the enjoyment that Christ has in His assembly, what is for His heart alone.<a name=68:12></a> How precious it is to Him!<a name=68:13></a>

		to make it clear, dear brethren, that I am seeking only to make an application, and do not assume to interpret the passage, which seems divinely intended to be in measure veiled, but I would suggest that it bears prophetically upon the present dispensation.<a name=79:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first thing mentioned is "the way of an eagle in the heavens".<a name=79:2></a> This thought is set forth in the Lord Jesus.<a name=79:3></a> As He says, "no one has gone up into heaven, save he who came down out of heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#3:13">John  3:13</a>).<a name=79:4></a> The eagle in its unrivalled power of flight has, so to speak, the liberty of the heavens; it can go anywhere it will.<a name=79:5></a> And so the Lord is presented as the ascending One -- He had in His person that inherent right, a divine right unique to Himself.<a name=79:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then the ascended One has now opened heaven to us in the Spirit's power.<a name=79:7></a> John is in the Spirit on the Lord's Day, he can soar; that is the time to soar, when conditions are divinely favourable.<a name=79:8></a> If we do not soar then, shall we do so as found in prayer, or in spiritual inquiry together, or in the meeting for ministry?<a name=79:9></a> We are to soar in spiritual power as a bird does in the open heavens.<a name=79:10></a> It has the inherent power that assures its liberty in a realm from which others are excluded.<a name=79:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then we have "the way of a serpent upon a rock".<a name=79:12></a> You will understand that I am referring to a rock here not as representing the Lord personally, but rather the situation resulting from the presence of the Lord in manhood here, a situation in which the tactics of Satanic opposition were brought to

	<div class="paragraph">
		"The ruler of the world comes, and in me he has nothing" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#14:30">John  14:30</a>).<a name=80:2></a> The Lord discerned his every move.<a name=80:3></a> He detected what was behind Peter's defection and met it with that word of rebuke, "Get away behind me, Satan" (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:23">Matthew  16:23</a>).<a name=80:4></a> He knew Judas from the beginning, saying "of you one is a devil" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#6:70">John  6:70</a>).<a name=80:5></a> The descent of the Lord Jesus in grace into manhood, one would say with reverence, gave opportunity for the serpent's attack.<a name=80:6></a> His foes in their subtle questions sought to wrest His words, but all to their confusion.<a name=80:7></a> Think again of the tremendous power brought to bear against Him in the temptations, and finally at Gethsemane, but then all this has resulted in the serpent's exposure and defeat.<a name=80:8></a> The blessed Lord stood His ground here, even to the death of the cross.<a name=80:9></a> "That through death he might annul him who has the might of death, that is, the devil" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#2:14">Hebrews  2:14</a>).<a name=80:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But then the Lord would set us up individually in spiritual power to detect and resist the enemy's devices and to stand our ground against him -- as the word is "prove the spirits, if they are of God" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#4:1">1 John  4:1</a>).<a name=80:11></a> And again, "every one begotten of God does not sin, but he that has been begotten of God keeps himself, and the wicked one does not touch him" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#5:18">1 John  5:18</a>).<a name=80:12></a> How impregnable, also, is the assembly, as of the rock against which the gates of Hades shall not prevail (<a href="../bible/Matthew.htm#16:18">Matthew  16:18</a>)!<a name=80:13></a>

		an allusion to the testimony going through victoriously.<a name=81:1></a> We need have no fear as to this, for He who once went through this scene of death in triumph, freighted with all the treasures of divine love, will preserve His own.<a name=81:2></a> "Those thou hast given me I have guarded, and not one of them has perished, but the son of perdition" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#17:12">John  17:12</a>).<a name=81:3></a> And then again the word to the disciples is "be of good courage: I have overcome the world" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#16:33">John  16:33</a>).<a name=81:4></a> Thus Paul had no fear but that the testimony would go through.<a name=81:5></a> He was concerned that Timothy should continue, for many then, as now, were among the deserters.<a name=81:6></a> But Luke had stood by.<a name=81:7></a> "Luke alone is with me" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#4:11">2 Timothy  4:11</a>).<a name=81:8></a> Deserters here are seldom reinstated, but such is the dispensation of grace that a Mark who fled from Pamphylia is recovered spiritually to acceptable service.<a name=81:9></a> "Take Mark, and bring him with thyself, for he is serviceable to me for ministry" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#4:11">2 Timothy  4:11</a>).<a name=81:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The ship of the testimony is homeward bound.<a name=81:11></a> Let us be livingly in it.<a name=81:12></a> We cannot be mere passengers on that ship.<a name=81:13></a> There is no provision for such.<a name=81:14></a> Paul made no secret that there were storms ahead, as indicated in the second epistle to Timothy, and elsewhere.<a name=81:15></a> But the ship is going through triumphantly under the hand of the Lord, who is the Defender of the testimony.<a name=81:16></a> We are told of many ships starting across the Lake of Gennesaret, but we only hear of one reaching the other side, the one the Lord was in.<a name=81:17></a> There are many denominational ships today, but they are not seaworthy; they are

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, one word as to the last thought, "the way of a man with a maid".<a name=82:3></a> We think of the Lord ascending far above all heavens; we see Him descending in love; we see Him in the testimony as Defender of it bringing the church through many a storm into the desired haven, and now we have this thought, "the way of a man with a maid".<a name=82:4></a> May this not be viewed as a veiled allusion to the relations of Christ and the assembly?<a name=82:5></a> His love so expressed -- "This is my body, which is for you" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:24">1 Corinthians  11:24</a>), and then love's answer -- "I have espoused you unto one man, to present you a chaste virgin to Christ" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#11:2">2 Corinthians  11:2</a>)!<a name=82:6></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		How different by contrast is the woman in verse twenty, representing as she does the great imitative system marked by marital unfaithfulness, which she would seek to cover in hypocrisy!<a name=82:7></a> "Such is the way of an adulterous woman".<a name=82:8></a> But she is exposed in her attempted assumption of the feature of inscrutability marking the previous four.<a name=82:9></a> The Lord's ascent on high, His descent into death, His passing through in triumph -- all these activities of love converge on His relationships of love with the church.<a name=82:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In closing I would briefly illustrate these thoughts as seen in Acts.<a name=83:3></a> First as to the way of an eagle in the air.<a name=83:4></a> The Lord as the ascending One appeared among His disciples for forty days (chapter 1).<a name=83:5></a> How He would set forth the liberty of that scene to which He belonged, before His disciples, set up as they were through the gift of the Holy Spirit (chapter 2), in the liberty of heaven!<a name=83:6></a> What a favour is ours in having such an outlet Godward!<a name=83:7></a> We have thus the power to rise and in the spirit of sonship to cry "Abba Father" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:15">Romans  8:15</a>).<a name=83:8></a> "If therefore the Son shall set you free, ye shall be really free" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#8:36">John  8:36</a>).<a name=83:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Secondly, how well Peter was able to detect the movements of the enemy in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#5">Acts  5</a>!<a name=83:10></a> In Ananias and Sapphira the foe has come very near, but Peter foils the enemy's attack.<a name=83:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What a comfort to feel that the subtle movements of Satan, apparently so baffling, will be exposed!<a name=83:12></a> The gates of Hades are not going to prevail, and however subtle and skilled the foe may appear to be (as he is described by the prophet, <a href="../bible/Ezekiel.htm#28:11">Ezekiel  28:11</a> - 19) he is but an instrument in the hand of God.<a name=83:13></a> He has sinned from the beginning.<a name=83:14></a> There is no forgiveness for the tempter -- there is for the tempted; such is the

		discriminating fairness of God.<a name=84:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#7">Acts  7</a>may we not liken Stephen's spirit to a steadfast barque upon a stormy sea ploughing its way through the winds and waves of opposition and eventual martyrdom?<a name=84:2></a> What an abundant entrance into the everlasting kingdom was his!<a name=84:3></a> Was there ever such pressure in suffering, save in the unparalleled sufferings of the Lord Himself at Gethsemane and at Calvary?<a name=84:4></a> The storm increases round Stephen, but he enters harbour in full sail.<a name=84:5></a> He went right through in triumph and at the end he used what strength his enemies had left him to pray for them.<a name=84:6></a> Was there ever such a victory, save with his blessed Master Himself?<a name=84:7></a> The ship of the testimony is also seen in chapter 8 and thereafter continuing its onward course.<a name=84:8></a> All this leads up to the thought of the man with the maid -- the mystery of God regarding Christ and the assembly, as implied in the Lord's utterance from heaven to Saul, "why dost thou persecute me?<a name=84:9></a>" (chapter 9: 4).<a name=84:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have then these four features: first the liberty of heaven afforded the saints in the gift of the Spirit, the power to rise given them at Pentecost; secondly, the ability to detect the foe as seen in Peter when he marked his deadly attempt to enter in amongst the saints; thirdly in Stephen and Philip and others, we see the ship of the testimony making headway though the storms increase; and finally, we come to what introduces us to the great issue of all these, the truth of the mystery as implied in the Lord's use of the word "me" in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#9:4">Acts  9:4</a>.<a name=84:11></a> Christ is in heaven and

	<div class="paragraph">
		In each case, as I say, the person is spoken of as sitting -- a spiritual habit which we need to cultivate -- the ability to sit; not listlessly, nor self-indulgently, nor self-complacently, but sitting in subjection, and at the same time, in alertness.<a name=106:3></a> That is a thing to be cultivated.<a name=106:4></a> Perhaps there never was more need of it than today, because the tendency in present-day conditions, with things moving at a great pace, is for the mind to move continually from one thing to another, and it is often difficult to acquire a quiet mind; a mind that is alert, and at the same time restful.<a name=106:5></a> That, I believe, is essential -- a quiet mind and a quiet spirit -- if we are to have our part acceptably in the assembly.<a name=106:6></a>

		The thought before me in the above scriptures is that of promotion.<a name=113:5></a> The many times in which the Lord Himself makes mention of this subject is, I think, evidence as to the delight it gives to the heart of God to advance those who love Him.<a name=113:6></a> By advance, I mean grant them spiritual promotion by the true know-ledge of Himself.<a name=113:7></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Promotion in the world comes in the main in one of two ways -- either by dint of one's efforts, or by influence.<a name=113:9></a> The former involves a man's activity and industry, while the latter generally savours of favouritism.<a name=113:10></a>

		Now if God points out that promotion comes neither by the one way nor the other, we may depend upon it that there is a natural tendency with us to think that it does -- hence the need of the instruction.<a name=114:3></a>

		It is to be observed, however, in the verse referred to, that there is no reference made to the north, and I venture to suggest that by inference one might conclude -- though it is implied so gently and tenderly, doubtless so as not to cause fear or discouragement -- that promotion does in fact come from that quarter; so that the omissions of Scripture are as important as its statements.<a name=114:4></a>

		The thought of the north would carry with it the searching character of discipline -- although, let us never forget, it is even so the product of divine love.<a name=114:5></a> As in nature the roots of plant growth are promoted and stimulated by the winter, so the roots of the soul are the more firmly founded in the love of God as we come under His gracious education.<a name=114:6></a> He in whose school we are found, through grace, alone knows how to temper the north wind with the south and cause our hearts to delight in both.<a name=114:7></a> The bride in Canticles could say, "Awake, north wind, and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out" (<a href="../bible/SongofSongs.htm#4:16">Song of Songs  4:16</a>).<a name=114:8></a>

		I refer now to the character of this assembling, because coming together in a certain place in a physical way is not sufficient in itself.<a name=121:4></a> In order to assemble rightly there must be a previous history with God that has brought about certain features and a right spirit, and I believe that the ministry of John the Baptist is a great help in this regard.<a name=121:5></a> We may regard his ministry as the closing up of the old dispensation, and in one way it is, but I believe it also lays the basis for the new.<a name=121:6></a> The Lord lays much stress upon it.<a name=121:7></a> He refers back to it in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#1:4">Acts  1:4</a>, 5, and it is mentioned again when the question is raised as to one to take part in the ministry of the apostles: it must be one who had assembled with them all the time that the Lord Jesus came in and went out amongst them, beginning from the baptism of John.<a name=121:8></a>

		The great feature that marked John the Baptist's ministry was repentance.<a name=121:9></a> It had in view the complete and entire disallowance of the flesh -- a ministry that we do not like naturally, and that is not countenanced at all in the great religious world around us.<a name=121:10></a> It was not countenanced by the scribes

	<div class="paragraph">
		Well, one cannot dwell on the chapter now, but an important point is that we are to rejoice that our names are written in heaven (verse 20).<a name=129:11></a> That is, we keep our mind in that direction, we take account that our calling is heavenly, and this will give its character, lustre and dignity to what there is for God in the place.<a name=129:12></a> As in Ephesians -- "walk worthy of the calling

		In the beginning of the next chapter we have the Lord praying in a certain place, showing the great place that prayer has in this matter, but in between we get this little incident as to the house of Martha, and Mary in it, and what the Lord commends.<a name=130:5></a> It says, "And it came to pass .<a name=130:6></a>.<a name=130:7></a>.<a name=130:8></a> that <i>he</i> entered into a certain village".<a name=130:9></a> This is a village with certain per-sons there, and marked by certain features; the next village would not have the same persons and features.<a name=130:10></a> What does He find?<a name=130:11></a> He finds a spirit of unsubduedness, of activity that is not rightly controlled.<a name=130:12></a> Activity for the Lord is good, but let it be rightly directed.<a name=130:13></a> Here Martha's activity was out of place, and it brings into relief the attitude taken up by Mary.<a name=130:14></a> It says, "she had a sister called Mary, who also, having sat down at the feet of Jesus was listening to his word".<a name=130:15></a> That is, it was characteristic of her.<a name=130:16></a> That is important if there is to be intelligence -- we are to be habitually marked by listening to the

	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The word of Jesus is what comes to us, maybe through the local brethren, through gifts the Lord raises up, or through what is published, but the thing is, to be characterised by listening to the word of Jesus.<a name=131:6></a> I do not think we can expect that God will have the pleasure that He desires from the assembly if it lacks in intelligence.<a name=131:7></a> In Ephesians it says, "he has caused to abound towards us in all wisdom and intelligence, having made known to us the mystery of his will" (chapter 1: 8, 9).<a name=131:8></a> How much do we know about the will of God?<a name=131:9></a> Epaphras laboured for the saints at Colosse that they might "stand perfect and complete in all the will of God" (chapter 4: 12).<a name=131:10></a> Let us ask ourselves how much we understand of the will of God.<a name=131:11></a> Not so much His will in relation to our pathway, though that has its place, but how much do

		<a name=132>[Page 132]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		we understand of the will of God which really centres in Christ and the assembly?<a name=132:1></a> God desires that we should grow up in intelligence, and that can only be secured as Christ is livingly held as Head in the affections of the saints, and His word is recognised in that light.<a name=132:2></a> We do not come to listen to this brother or that brother, but come in the faith of our souls that the Lord, as the living Head of the assembly, will take the occasion to speak, and His word is to be listened to.<a name=132:3></a> We have of course to prove all things.<a name=132:4></a> The Bereans are commended for that, they are contrasted with the Thessalonians as being more noble because of "receiving the word with all readiness of mind, daily searching the scriptures if these things were so" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#17:11">Acts  17:11</a>).<a name=132:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the apostle, in writing to the Thessalonians, draws attention to that feature that was lacking in them, and says, "quench not the Spirit; do not lightly esteem prophecies; but prove all things, hold fast the right" (<a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#5:19">1 Thessalonians  5:19</a> - 21).<a name=132:6></a> The feature that was marking the Bereans is the feature that the apostle specially mentions to the Thessalonians when he writes to them.<a name=132:7></a> And so the epistle to the Colossians develops this thought of the headship of Christ, and the intelligence that is to flow from it.<a name=132:8></a> He warns the saints against "philosophy and vain deceit" (chapter 2: 8), and then says, it is "not according to Christ".<a name=132:9></a> That is to say, everything that is presented is tested in that way -- is it of Christ?<a name=132:10></a> Is it according to Christ?<a name=132:11></a> You notice the Lord commends Mary in saying, "there is need of one" (it really is, that is the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If in any degree we have become marked by the features of the man in chapter 8, let us see to it also that we seek to take on this feature of characteristically listening to the word of Christ, that we may become intelligent in the mind of God, for God has nothing less than sonship in mind: and that involves affection and intelligence.<a name=133:2></a> A father and mother take pleasure in their young children and delight in their affection and simplicity, but they delight in seeing intelligence develop; they rejoice in the time when their children can converse with them intelligently and sympathetically.<a name=133:3></a> So God is like that: He wants His children not to remain babes, but to enter intelligently into His own thoughts, and respond to them according to His mind.<a name=133:4></a>

		Now when we come to Chronicles we have depicted what is greatest.<a name=133:5></a> I can only touch on it for a moment, but it says, "king David went in and sat before Jehovah".<a name=133:6></a> It was a deliberate movement on his part.<a name=133:7></a> He had it in his heart to build a house for Jehovah, but God intercepted him through the prophet Nathan and told him that he was not to build it: it would seem that something was necessary before it could be built.<a name=133:8></a> David understands.<a name=133:9></a> What is in view now is the assembly as the great vessel of praise and worship Godward; the place where God is served.<a name=133:10></a> Are our gatherings together worthy of God?<a name=133:11></a> Is our response worthy of the blessed God, is all that takes place in our gatherings suggestive of the

		Well now, David as having in his heart to build the house, but being told he must not do it, goes and sits before God.<a name=134:9></a> In doing so he sets before us that, if we would develop in the ability to respond to God in a true spirit of worship, we must learn to sit before God, and allow God, so to speak, to become greater and greater before our eyes and hearts, as we take account of what <i>He</i> is going to do.<a name=134:10></a> Because, after all, God must be supreme; He must be greatest; and the

		(1) The prophet-apostle John sees, in vision, the holy city descending from heaven, having the glory of God.<a name=140:1></a> The vision refers to a future time when judgment will have fallen on apostate Christendom and the false witness will have been rejected by the Lord, as He so plainly said in <a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#3:16">Revelation  3:16</a>.<a name=140:2></a> It is a solemn reflection that this is the end towards which professed Christianity is hastening.<a name=140:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The present world, too -- that is, the world system -- will have been brought to nothing, and earth itself will have been cleansed from the defilement of sin by the judgment of God.<a name=140:4></a> Then it is that the church, the holy city, descends from heaven and comes with Christ to reign over the earth.<a name=140:5></a> We need not remark that before this could take place the Lord will call His own to be with Him.<a name=140:6></a> The Bridegroom will come and take home His bride.<a name=140:7></a> <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#4:15">1 Thessalonians  4:15</a> and <a href="../bible/John.htm#14">John  14</a>are two passages which clearly refer to this blessed fact.<a name=140:8></a> The immediate hope of the church is the coming of Christ to take her to be with Himself.<a name=140:9></a> Today it is a time of fasting for the believer, for the Bridegroom has been taken away (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#5:34">Luke  5:34</a>, 35).<a name=140:10></a> But His word assures us He is coming again.<a name=140:11></a> What joy unspeakable it will be when we see His blessed face!<a name=140:12></a>

		<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#21">Revelation  21</a>is after this; in fact, the first eight verses refer to eternity, verse 9 commences a detailed description of God's holy city.<a name=140:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		First, then, the city is heavenly.<a name=140:14></a> It comes down from the place to which it belongs.<a name=140:15></a> It is to be feared that we forget that we are a heavenly people and that

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		How slow we are to realise this and to take up our own proper interests!<a name=141:3></a> The church, that is, the company comprising all believers today, is a heavenly company -- heavenly in its calling and character.<a name=141:4></a> We are not of the world, and presently Christ will come and take us to be with Himself in heaven.<a name=141:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is saddening to a degree to observe how eagerly the political and other interests of this world are pursued by those whose interests are really heavenly, and who at any moment may be taken to heaven by Christ.<a name=141:6></a> How deadening, too, is earthly-mindedness!<a name=141:7></a> The apostle wept as he spoke of some who were characterised as "minding earthly things".<a name=141:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The church is to be taken to heaven, thence to return with Him when He comes again to reign over this earth, where He is at present rejected.<a name=141:9></a> And God is forming us now, forming our souls, with a view to our fulfilling our part as the holy city, which comes down from heaven and will be the centre of interest and influence in that day.<a name=141:10></a> It descends from heaven and bears a heavenly influence.<a name=141:11></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		(2) The next feature we may notice is that the city has the glory of God.<a name=141:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		By glory we understand the expression of excellence.<a name=141:13></a> God has been revealed.<a name=141:14></a> His holiness, mercy, grace and righteousness, as well as His nature, love, have been declared in Christ.<a name=141:15></a> God's

	<div class="paragraph">
		excellence has been expressed, and, in the passage we are considering, what came out in Jesus is seen characterising the holy city.<a name=142:1></a> It shines with light which is derived not from any improvement of fallen man, but from the glory of God.<a name=142:2></a> Christ is its light!<a name=142:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The light will be pure and unalloyed then.<a name=142:4></a> There will be no sin to darken, no will of man to pervert the clear shining of God's glory through this chosen vessel, the church.<a name=142:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This glory is enshrined in the church today.<a name=142:6></a> "Ye are the temple of God", says the apostle, in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#3:16">1 Corinthians  3:16</a>, and in God's temple every whit utters His glory.<a name=142:7></a> We should bear that character now.<a name=142:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		(3) Flowing from this, and dependent upon it, we read that there is no need of any natural light.<a name=142:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The greatest natural light is eclipsed by that glory which is above the brightness of the sun.<a name=142:10></a> It was this glory, this light, which arrested Saul of Tarsus, and thenceforth Paul, the "bondman of Jesus Christ" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#1:1">Romans  1:1</a>), is superior to the need of any earthly light, light of mere human intelligence and learning.<a name=142:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the epistle to Colossians the apostle seeks to place believers in the advantage of this superiority now.<a name=142:12></a> The imaginations of the natural mind, the searchings of philosophy, the fleshly efforts of a legal soul, are viewed as not only an uncertain light, and therefore worse than useless, and they are a slight on Christ, they draw away from Him.<a name=142:13></a> All fulness dwells in Him.<a name=142:14></a> He is the Head, as we have before remarked, and, if only we are in touch with Him, all earthly light grows dim.<a name=142:15></a>

		Considerable uncertainty exists in the minds of many dear believers as to the Lord's day (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#1:10">Revelation  1:10</a>), which is the first day of the week, and the Sabbath day which is the seventh day of the week.<a name=145:2></a> The fourth commandment (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#20:8">Exodus  20:8</a>) is often made to refer to the Lord's day, though actually it refers solely to the seventh or last day of the week.<a name=145:3></a> In the early church no such confusion existed between the two days until the fourth century, when the Roman Emperor Constantine legalised the keeping of Sunday and theologians began to tack the name of Sabbath on to that day.<a name=145:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The keeping of the Sabbath by the Jews was allowed by their Roman conquerors.<a name=145:5></a> It would have been easy for the first Christians, most of whom were Jews, to have continued to have observed that day and avail themselves of the Roman clemency in regard to the seventh day of the week.<a name=145:6></a> Instead of this we find that the first day of the week was observed from the very first inception of Christianity.<a name=145:7></a> This remarkable fact is a most striking testimony to the truth of the resurrection.<a name=145:8></a> The Sabbath day had been kept by the Jews because God had rested on the seventh day (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#2:3">Genesis  2:3</a>); the Lord's day was observed by the Christians because it was the day the Lord Jesus rose from the dead.<a name=145:9></a> This stupendous miracle, the resurrection of Christ, has given colour to the whole of the christian dispensation and,

	<div class="paragraph">
		I wish to speak at this time about our Lord Jesus Christ as Son of man, not in a general way, for He is so designated in many parts of Scripture, but to confine my remarks to John's presentation of Him in that character.<a name=170:11></a> The other evangelists, as you will be aware, refer to the Lord under this designation more frequently than John, particularly the official gospels, as I may call them, Matthew and Luke.<a name=170:12></a> But

	<div class="paragraph">
		in order to understand their references, and indeed, the references of the prophet Ezekiel, we have to understand John.<a name=171:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One is impressed, the more one considers John, that we have to understand everything now from his standpoint, and particularly this subject that I propose to dwell upon.<a name=171:2></a> For whilst he refers to the Lord in this way less frequently than do those other two evangelists, yet he refers to Him in peculiar connections, in connections that are intended to emphasise in our minds the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ under this title.<a name=171:3></a> I hope that in what I have to say, we shall each afford Him in this connection more place in our affections, because I apprehend that these verses in chapter 13 have reference to the place that He now has.<a name=171:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God has glorified Him in Himself, and He has done so immediately; and the immediate glory that has come to the Lord according to this passage, involves the place that the Father has given Him in the saints, that is, in ourselves, who form the assembly.<a name=171:5></a> The assembly, or the circle of the saints, as seen in John, is the sphere in which God operates now, and in which He glorifies His Son, the Son of man.<a name=171:6></a> The world is not yet the sphere in which to glorify the Son of man; and, as yet, Israel He has not, but He has the assembly.<a name=171:7></a> The Lord as He rose from the dead said, "I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the congregation [assembly] will I praise thee" (<a href="../bible/Psalm.htm#22:22">Psalm  22:22</a>).<a name=171:8></a> The assembly was that which God secured immediately, and which is
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=172>[Page 172]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		thus available for any display which He may make; and as He glorifies the Son of man immediately, it is obviously in that sphere, which He has immediately secured.<a name=172:1></a> So I hope the Lord may use what I have to say to enhance His own place in our affections as the Son of man.<a name=172:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now the first reference to Christ as Son of man in John's gospel is in chapter 1: 51; it is the Lord's own statement, made to Nathanael, whom He Himself describes as "an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!<a name=172:3></a>" (verse 47, Authorised Version).<a name=172:4></a> He said to the Lord, "thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel" (verse 49).<a name=172:5></a> Nathanael had come into the light of the second psalm, and as moving to Christ, the Lord describes him as an <i>Israelite indeed</i>.<a name=172:6></a> Nathanael says, "Whence knowest thou me?<a name=172:7></a>" Jesus says, "Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee" (verse 48).<a name=172:8></a> To Nathanael's mind the Son of God was present; the King of Israel was present.<a name=172:9></a> What a moment for an Israelite, to be brought thus face to face with the Son of God and the King of Israel!<a name=172:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And what that suggests to my mind is that the opening part of John introduces to us certain persons who apprehended Christ.<a name=172:11></a> The opening chapter is not so much occupied with direct divine statements, as it is with giving an account of what certain persons <i>apprehended</i>.<a name=172:12></a> It is a question, therefore, since John applies to our own time, of what we <i>apprehend</i>, and what is apprehended is the result of contemplation.<a name=172:13></a> The evangelist says, "(we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father),
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=173>[Page 173]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		full of grace and truth".<a name=173:1></a> They contemplated His glory as with the Father; He was apprehended as an only-begotten with a father.<a name=173:2></a> You see, the present moment is the outcome of God having wrought in certain individuals, who through contemplation came into the apprehension of Christ.<a name=173:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To enforce this great principle, John the Baptist tells us that in being sent to baptise with water, he was told how to locate Him who should baptise with the Spirit.<a name=173:4></a> For of what value is water baptism save there be Spirit baptism?<a name=173:5></a> Water baptism in itself can avail nothing unless there is One to baptise with the Spirit.<a name=173:6></a> We must couple these two things together.<a name=173:7></a> John says, "he who sent me to baptise with water, <i>he</i> said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, he it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit.<a name=173:8></a> And I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God" (verses 33, 34).<a name=173:9></a> Thus we see that this gospel introduces to us those who by contemplation acquired a knowledge of the Son of God, and John the Baptist bears record.<a name=173:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in the evangelist and those with him, and in John the Baptist, we have a nucleus which became the witness; the light of the knowledge of the Son of God was in their hearts and in their minds.<a name=173:11></a> Then we find that John the Baptist, looking on Jesus as He walked, says, "Behold the Lamb of God" (verse 36).<a name=173:12></a> He bore testimony to Him as an Object of attraction; and may I say that scarcely any one is too young to be attracted by a lamb!<a name=173:13></a> We read here that the two disciples heard him speaking, and they followed

		<a name=174>[Page 174]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Jesus.<a name=174:1></a> Now there is a movement; we have a nucleus of light, as I said, of persons illuminated with the light of the knowledge of the Son of God, and I believe this corresponds exactly to our own times.<a name=174:2></a> There have been those who came into the apprehension of the Son of God, and they bore record.<a name=174:3></a> John represents the type of testimony that affects people at the present time.<a name=174:4></a> He says, "Behold the Lamb of God".<a name=174:5></a> He himself was affected; he was moved, and two of his disciples heard him and they followed Jesus.<a name=174:6></a> You will observe that I am speaking of the Son of God, because it is the Son of God who gives character to our dispensation; but I wish to show that, as He is apprehended thus, His place as Son of man is to be fully recognised in our minds and hearts.<a name=174:7></a> John the Baptist is, as I may say, a characteristic witness; he seems to be in the mind of the evangelist a model witness; he is moved by the testimony, by the light that has come into his soul, and his testimony draws others to Jesus.<a name=174:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now in speaking of the Son of God, I may add another word, and that is that the Son of God is Christ on the <i>divine</i> side.<a name=174:9></a> John shows that it is, as it were, God approaching men with His beloved Son in His hand (you will understand me).<a name=174:10></a> Luke presents the other side; he shows you Simeon in the temple with the Babe in his arms.<a name=174:11></a> If God approaches us with His beloved Son, as He does, He is contemplated as with the Father, full of grace and truth.<a name=174:12></a> It is God approaching us with His Son, as it were, in His bosom, and His Son is full of grace and truth.<a name=174:13></a> He has
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=175>[Page 175]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		in Him the means of meeting men as they are, and setting them up suitably to Himself.<a name=175:1></a> That is what the Son of God means.<a name=175:2></a> God has His answer by Him.<a name=175:3></a> His Son is the adequate witness to His love: "God so loved .<a name=175:4></a>.<a name=175:5></a>.<a name=175:6></a> that he gave his only-begotten Son" (chapter 3: 16).<a name=175:7></a> But when you come to the Son of man, He is seen in the arms of Simeon (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:28">Luke  2:28</a>).<a name=175:8></a> It is not through the Son of man that God approaches us, but it is through the Son of man that we approach God.<a name=175:9></a> You will note that Simeon had Him in his arms.<a name=175:10></a> What a spectacle, beloved!<a name=175:11></a> Simeon is our representative; he is a man who came by the Spirit into the temple, and as he was there by the Spirit, Joseph and Mary came in with the Babe, and he took up the Babe in his arms.<a name=175:12></a> I stand behind him, as it were, and I see that Babe as He is there in the temple, and I say, How enriched the race is, how graced it is!<a name=175:13></a> He has come in on our side; and he who by the Spirit understands the position, takes Him in his arms.<a name=175:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		If God comes in on His own side to meet us, to make known His love to us, He comes in with His Son, but if I am to draw near to God, it is with the Son of man.<a name=175:15></a> It is not, I may remark, by way of guarding these thoughts, that He intended to adorn man in the flesh, it was far otherwise, but nevertheless, coming into this world as a Babe He came in in connection with humanity, and Luke presents Him to us in that light; and Simeon, who is in the mind of heaven by the Spirit, takes Him in his arms.<a name=175:16></a> I do not know that I can commend anything
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=176>[Page 176]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		greater to you than that you should understand how to take Christ, viewed as Son of man, in your arms.<a name=176:1></a> You are then before God as belonging to the race of men according to all that Christ is.<a name=176:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Having said that much about Luke, I intend now to show how the Lord would bring in the thought of the Son of man to the mind of an Israelite; I refer to Nathanael.<a name=176:3></a> Whilst he is called an <i>Israelite indeed</i>, in whom there is no guile, he is nevertheless marked by those limitations that always mark a nationalist.<a name=176:4></a> Nationalism is one of the most potent elements there are even amongst the people of God, but the Son of man is not in relation to nations as such; He is in relation to <i>men</i>.<a name=176:5></a> Hence the Lord would emphasise to the mind of an Israelite the place that the Son of man has in heaven.<a name=176:6></a> He was an Israelite in all that the term signifies; but he was to see "greater things".<a name=176:7></a> That is a word that should come home to us.<a name=176:8></a> It is the "greater things" (verse 50) that deliver us from the lesser.<a name=176:9></a> The lesser is the national, the greater is the universal.<a name=176:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is obvious that what Adam represented must be greater than what Abraham represented.<a name=176:11></a> Adam was a primary thought; Abraham represented the provisional thought.<a name=176:12></a> Very great indeed in its development is the idea of a nation and a kingdom, and God will develop these two features to their completion.<a name=176:13></a> We shall see a nation such as earth has never seen, and we shall see a kingdom such as earth has never seen; but those who are to have part in these things, great as they are, are to understand that
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=177>[Page 177]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		there are greater things.<a name=177:1></a> And the greater has reference to Adam, and so Adam's son, the Son of man, inherits all the glory that attaches to the race; and the "Israelite indeed" has to understand that these are greater things.<a name=177:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the Lord says, in that well-known strengthened affirmative of John, "Verily, verily, I say to you, Henceforth ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man" (verse 51).<a name=177:3></a> The Israelite is to know that heaven, instead of for the moment being occupied with Jacob, or with Christ as descended from Jacob, is occupied with Him as descended from Adam: "which was the son of Adam", Luke says, "which was the son of God" (chapter 3: 38, Authorised Version).<a name=177:4></a> Man has a wonderful place with God; He had him in His mind from eternity.<a name=177:5></a>

		Although the Lord has favoured us with a good deal of light as to the assembly, we still need to be reminded of the special place which local assemblies have in His mind.<a name=177:9></a> We are all apt to be too individual, and to forget that the Lord is concerned about assemblies -- local companies of saints.<a name=177:10></a> Such companies are of great interest to Him because this is the particular form which the work and testimony of God takes at the present time.<a name=177:11></a>

		We may remember that Solomon is spoken of in Ecclesiastes as the Preacher, and in the margin of the New Translation the word 'preacher' is said to mean 'a former of assemblies'.<a name=178:1></a> The Lord would have us to consider Him in that light; it is the key to what took place in the early days of the church's history, and to what is taking place now.<a name=178:2></a> It is one of Christ's excellent designations that He is 'a former of assemblies'; when the voice of Christ is listened to, assemblies will be formed.<a name=178:3></a> It was so at the beginning, the speaking of Christ was heard, and the result was, not only that people were converted and brought into the blessing of the gospel, but local assemblies were formed; Christ was known to be the 'former of assemblies'.<a name=178:4></a> It was so at Corinth; Christ spoke in Paul (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#13:3">2 Corinthians  13:3</a>) and the result of His speaking was that an assembly was formed in that city, and it became a "golden lamp" -- a vessel of spiritual light; that is the proper ideal of a local assembly.<a name=178:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The idea of local assemblies has very largely disappeared in Christendom.<a name=178:6></a> There are great national systems of religion, and sects, some with a little more light than others, but all constituted by influences other than the speaking of Christ.<a name=178:7></a> The local assembly viewed according to the mind of God is constituted by the speaking of Christ, and as a vessel of spiritual light it is spiritual in its constitution.<a name=178:8></a> We must begin with this idea; it does not do for us to derive our thoughts from the confused and disorderly state of Christendom; we
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=179>[Page 179]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		must view this matter according to the divine conception; if that is before us it will steady our souls.<a name=179:1></a> It is a help to get the thought that according to God each local assembly is a vessel of spiritual light, and there is but that one vessel of spiritual light in a city.<a name=179:2></a> There was such a vessel in Corinth, and it had its counterpart in every other city and place where the Lord's name was called upon.<a name=179:3></a> Spiritual light was there, and it was nowhere else; outside was darkness.<a name=179:4></a> It should be our desire to be identified with that which is locally a vessel of spiritual light; that is what we want to look for.<a name=179:5></a> We can understand how Satan would desire to obscure such lights, and to introduce into local assemblies elements of darkness, but we may be sure that the Lord will never give up the original divine thought, nor will He acquiesce in anything that is contrary to it.<a name=179:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may learn from the verses read the kind of material of which the local assembly is formed; it is composed of persons who have the consciousness of the present love of Christ.<a name=179:7></a> In each local assembly you could hear such an utterance as this, "To him who loves us, and has washed us from our sins in his blood, and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father".<a name=179:8></a> Those who can say that have a spiritual constitution.<a name=179:9></a> The first feature of the local assembly is that it is a company of persons in the conscious-ness of the present love of Christ; then they can say, He "has washed us from our sins in his blood".<a name=179:10></a> He sets us together in the very place where we had been sinners, in the complete cleansing which His blood

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=180>[Page 180]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		effects; all that made up our former history is washed away.<a name=180:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then He "has .<a name=180:2></a>.<a name=180:3></a>.<a name=180:4></a> made us a kingdom"; that intimates that we are not sinning now.<a name=180:5></a> Having been washed from our sins in His blood, He has made us a kingdom; He has constituted us a realm for God.<a name=180:6></a> To be a kingdom is a contrast to sinning; it is truly a blessed thing to be a realm for God.<a name=180:7></a> In every place where there is a local assembly there is a bit of territory which constitutes a divine realm.<a name=180:8></a> That is an important spiritual element, and, as we have said, if there is to be a local vessel of spiritual light, spiritual elements are essential to it.<a name=180:9></a> Anyone who loves God would delight to know that there is a bit of territory in the place where he lives that is an ordered realm for God, a realm where insubject or unruly elements are not tolerated, a kingdom -- not a democracy, and that as having been subdued to God by His grace he forms part of it.<a name=180:10></a> That is how Christ forms assemblies.<a name=180:11></a> As these spiritual features are present -- the consciousness of Christ's present love, of being washed from every stain of what pertained to our former history, and as constituted a kingdom -- there is the establishment in a company of persons locally of what is morally suitable to God.<a name=180:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As we walk together locally as a kingdom, a realm for God, and as delivered from the lawlessness of sin, we are free to understand that Christ has made us priests to God and His Father.<a name=180:13></a> That is another element; we have spiritual constitution Godward; that is the thought of priests.<a name=180:14></a> It is not
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=181>[Page 181]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		merely that we are spiritual enough to refuse the flesh and to be separate from the world -- that would be involved in being a kingdom -- but there is something further; He has made us priests to God; there is spirituality Godward.<a name=181:1></a> It is in taking account of these elements that we get a right and divine idea of the local assembly.<a name=181:2></a> When these elements are present there is a vessel of spiritual light locally, a number of persons who can stand in priestly service in the presence of Christ's God and Father, having ability to serve intelligently in prayer and praise and worship.<a name=181:3></a> The speaking of Christ leads to our having a place as priests with His God and His Father, though believers are often slow to follow the leading of Christ in this respect.<a name=181:4></a> If we read the gospels we see how the speaking of Christ was all designed to lead men in their thoughts and affections to His God and Father.<a name=181:5></a> One great end for which He came was that men might be constituted priests to His God and Father.<a name=181:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In the local assembly the headship of Christ is recognised.<a name=181:7></a> There are many large and fine buildings where the name of Christ is mentioned, but what spiritual persons would look for is the recognition of the headship of Christ.<a name=181:8></a> Where it is recognised, there is something locally that has assembly character, and priestly service to His God and His Father will be found there.<a name=181:9></a> Where these elements are found there will be locally a vessel of spiritual light -- a golden lamp.<a name=181:10></a> I trust that each one of us has a desire to be identified with what has that character, and to

	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=182>[Page 182]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		contribute to it as being an integral part of it; surely none of us would care to be an unattached unit!<a name=182:1></a> We desire to be thoroughly committed to what is of Christ and of God, to be part of the local vessel of spiritual light, not merely to be near it, but part of it.<a name=182:2></a> This is a real exercise for young people and for any who have not definitely taken their part and place in the local assembly; it is for them to consider whether they are not robbing the Lord of His due and God of His realm.<a name=182:3></a> As we learn from Scripture the divine thought as to local assemblies it becomes our privilege and responsibility to confess the truth practically by identifying ourselves with those who also confess it.<a name=182:4></a> If one is not thoroughly identified with the practical confession of the truth one misses a great deal of divine grace that can only be realised assembly-wise.<a name=182:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It was before me on this occasion to dwell on the immense resources that are available for support in local assemblies.<a name=182:6></a> It is evident that assemblies <i>can</i> be maintained as vessels of spiritual light; we see that in Smyrna and Philadelphia, both of which came under the eye of the Son of man without rebuke.<a name=182:7></a> Our dear brethren who do not recognise the local assembly, and who do not identify themselves with it, miss the peculiar grace which there is on the part of divine Persons for the assemblies; I believe it surpasses the grace that there is for individuals.<a name=182:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This comes out here very plainly in verse 4: "John to the seven assemblies which are in Asia: Grace to you and peace from him who is, and who

		was, and who is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne; and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the first-born from the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth".<a name=183:1></a> Think of that grace!<a name=183:2></a> Favourableness on the part of each Person in the Godhead, not here towards individuals, but flowing out upon the saints assembly-wise, for it is to "the seven assemblies".<a name=183:3></a> There is grace commensurate with the position, so that if much responsibility attaches to local assemblies as being golden lamps, there is corresponding grace.<a name=183:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God in His eternal unchangeableness -- "him who is, and who was, and who is to come"; God in His eternal faithfulness, is favourable to local assemblies.<a name=183:5></a> It is in writing to a local assembly that Paul says in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:9">1 Corinthians  1:9</a>, "God is faithful, by whom ye have been called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord", and in chapter 10: 13, "God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above what ye are able to bear".<a name=183:6></a> It is the faithfulness of God as pledged to those who are walking in the fellowship that finds expression in the local assembly.<a name=183:7></a> The faithfulness of God is a very good 'ground of gathering'.<a name=183:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then there is grace from "the seven Spirits which are before his throne".<a name=183:9></a> This is the Spirit of God not viewed as indwelling persons, or as the one Spirit baptising all saints in one body, but regarded in His relation to the throne.<a name=183:10></a> Perfection is there as intimated by the number seven, but seen figuratively as "lamps of fire, burning before the throne", chapter 4: 5.<a name=183:11></a> It

		suggests the maintenance in a judicial way of what corresponds with the throne.<a name=184:1></a> The seven Spirits are viewed objectively in the unlimited power that attaches to a divine Person to maintain what is due to the throne.<a name=184:2></a> The fact that grace and peace come to the local assemblies from the seven Spirits would assure us of divine help in matters relating to the throne, that is, the rights of God.<a name=184:3></a> Questions do sometimes arise that are like an Amalekite hand on the throne (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#17:16">Exodus  17:16</a>).<a name=184:4></a> The seven Spirits of God would not tolerate any defiance of divine rights, but They are favourable to the assemblies as being resource for us in matters which require to be judged as being contrary to the throne.<a name=184:5></a>

		When the same apostle wrote that profound, yet simple, treatise on the glad tidings -- the epistle to the Romans -- it is <br>THE GOSPEL OF GOD, <br>of which he wrote, for God is its <i>Source</i>.<a name=190:2></a> That epistle treats of the power of God, the righteousness of God, the wrath of God, the goodness of God, and the love of God.<a name=190:3></a> The object of the gospel, as unfolded in that epistle, is to bring a man into such blessing in the knowledge of God that he can be set up on earth in triumph and eternal life, for the glory of God, and that he should finally be "conformed to the image of his Son" (chapter 8: 29).<a name=190:4></a>

		Another distinctive title of the gospel is given by the apostle, in his second epistle to the Corinthians, as he tells of "the radiancy of the glad tidings of the glory of the Christ, who is the image of God" (chapter 4: 4), or, as this may be alternatively translated <br>THE GOSPEL OF THE GLORY OF THE CHRIST, <br>for that is its <i>dignity</i>.<a name=191:2></a> The perfect life of Jesus, His atoning death, His triumphant resurrection, have consummated in His glory at the right hand of God.<a name=191:3></a> The radiancy of that glory shines in His face today; for "God, who spoke that out of darkness light should shine who has shone in our hearts for the shining forth of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ" (verse 6).<a name=191:4></a> What dignity there is in such a gospel!<a name=191:5></a> How worthy to be proclaimed far and wide, for it is the glad tidings of the glory of His Person.<a name=191:6></a>

		In the same epistle the inspired writer enlarges upon the untold resources of God unfolded by the gospel in the preaching among the Gentiles of the glad tidings of <br>THE UNSEARCHABLE RICHES OF CHRIST, <br>which are expressive of the <i>wealth</i> of the gospel.<a name=192:1></a> These riches are brought within the reach of those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity, and though "unsearchable" can be enjoyed, by the power of the Holy Spirit of God, by the simplest believer in Jesus.<a name=192:2></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Finally, when writing to his child in the faith, Timothy, the apostle, with his heart moved by its magnificence, refers to <br>The Gospel Of The Glory Of The Blessed God, <br>which was committed to his trust (<a href="../bible/1Timothy.htm#1:11">1 Timothy  1:11</a>).<a name=192:3></a> This is surely its <i>fulness</i>, for the glory of the blessed God is the perfect revelation of Himself in the removal of the distance between God and man, from His own side.<a name=192:4></a> Thus God's great glory will witness to the greatness of the gospel when surrounded by the myriads of the redeemed (each one of whom has been reached and blessed by the gospel), He will "rest in his love; he will exult over thee with singing" (<a href="../bible/Zephaniah.htm#3:17">Zephaniah  3:17</a>).<a name=192:5></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In our papers we have sought to meditate upon the church in some of the aspects in which it is presented in Scripture, as also to consider its formation and what it is peculiarly, namely, the body of Christ.<a name=193:2></a> But our idea of the church will be imperfect if we do not recognise that God's will is that His people should assemble, or "come together", as Scripture speaks.<a name=193:3></a> The members of the body of Christ are to enjoy what is proper to them, and the house of God is not to exist without any spiritual realisation of its privilege and practical recognition of its responsibilities.<a name=193:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The church of God may evidently be regarded in three ways:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(1) As actually existent on earth, whether universally or locally, and, as thus, embracing every believer, whether on the whole earth or in a locality.<a name=193:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(2) As a gathered company, that is, as a number of believers meeting together.<a name=193:6></a> It is thus presented in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11">1 Corinthians  11</a>- 14.<a name=193:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(3) In what is proper to it in its spiritual privileges.<a name=193:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is clear that these are very distinct views of the same company of persons.<a name=193:9></a> For example, the earlier part of 1 Corinthians (with the exception of chapter 5) considers the saints in the first light.<a name=193:10></a> It is addressed to the "assembly of God which is in

		Corinth", at the same time linking them with every other believer.<a name=194:1></a> But they are not viewed as "assembled", or come together, until chapter 11.<a name=194:2></a> Going to law, marriage, going to a feast, if invited, could not apply to the church as assembled.<a name=194:3></a> But our whole conduct must be regulated by what is abidingly true of us.<a name=194:4></a> We are always God's assembly, we have always to be true to the character of God's temple.<a name=194:5></a> Hence the corrective nature of the earlier chapters of the epistle, so that the conduct of each individual might be regulated by what is the calling of the whole christian company.<a name=194:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapters 11 - 14, however, the church, or assembly, that is, the Christians in the locality, are considered as "come together".<a name=194:7></a> We need only read the chapters to see this.<a name=194:8></a> We shall develop this later, if God will.<a name=194:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But it is also to be observed that believers are entitled to enjoy privileges of a peculiarly spiritual character.<a name=194:10></a> The epistle of 1 Corinthians does not allude to this side of the subject, but, as another has fittingly remarked, views the church as 'the assembly in the wilderness -- a separate and self-judged people in the world where Christ died'.<a name=194:11></a> Other parts of Scripture relate to this spiritual ground which we have the privilege to enter upon.<a name=194:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is no doubt that the enjoyment of these spiritual privileges would greatly colour the order and utterance of all in the assembly as a gathered company.<a name=194:13></a> But the ground or region is distinct, and it would be quite possible for a believer to be in the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We desire to consider the subject of the church as "come together" in this paper.<a name=195:2></a> But we wish it to be fully recognised that spiritual privileges of the assembly are open to us on such occasions in an especial way.<a name=195:3></a> Happy, indeed, if in our souls we pass from the region of what is outward to what is spiritual and so take up spiritual ground.<a name=195:4></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The subject of the Lord's supper will come before us in another paper, if God permit, but we feel it to be necessary to state that the Lord's supper is referred to as <i>introducing</i> the section of the epistle which views the saints as "assembled".<a name=195:5></a> It is the Supper which calls us together.<a name=195:6></a> We "come together" to break bread.<a name=195:7></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Viewing the assembly in the light in which we have noticed it is presented in <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11">1 Corinthians  11</a>- 14, we may observe:
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(1) That the church is the body of Christ and hence is the <i>vessel of the activity of the Holy Spirit</i>.<a name=195:8></a>

		The "body" is not one member, but many.<a name=196:8></a> And the gifts and manifestations of the Spirit are in the body, not in one member only, however valuable the member may be.<a name=196:9></a> We feel that such a slight to the Holy Spirit must grieve Him and be very displeasing to the Lord; and the writer would earnestly ask every one who reads these lines if he is sanctioning, by his presence or patronage, any system or human organisation which so grievously ignores the presence of the Holy Spirit and His sovereignty to distribute to whomsoever He will.<a name=196:10></a> It may be replied

		Apparently the Corinthians were making overmuch of the sign gifts -- tongues, for instance, and were exercising them to the exaltation of man, and not to edification.<a name=200:1></a> The apostle corrects this error and points out that the gift of prophecy was rather to be coveted.<a name=200:2></a> By prophecy we are not necessarily to understand the foretelling of future events, but the announcing the mind of God for the present moment.<a name=200:3></a> He who prophesied spoke to "edification, and encouragement and consolation".<a name=200:4></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So we find praying, singing, giving thanks, teaching and prophesying -- all to be in the spirit and with understanding.<a name=201:2></a> And let it be remarked that these activities are not to be restricted to any particular member, for we read, "ye can all prophesy".<a name=201:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We would again ask the reader, does he enjoy this happy liberty?<a name=201:4></a> Of course, we presume all pray silently, but this is publicly in the gathered company of believers -- the assembly of God.<a name=201:5></a> We cannot regard any gathering together of Christians as answering to the mind of God unless there is this liberty for any to take part in due godly order.<a name=201:6></a> Women are expressly forbidden to speak in the assembly.<a name=201:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have already remarked that the chapters before us do not refer to the higher spiritual privileges proper to the assembly in which, surely, "sisters" as well as "brothers" are entitled to participate.<a name=201:8></a> 1 Corinthians relates to the order in the church of God on earth.<a name=201:9></a> This surely is not everything, but it cannot be disregarded, for to do so must grieve the Spirit who has given such detailed instructions for our guidance.<a name=201:10></a> And if the Spirit is grieved we are quite unable to enjoy the blessed privileges of the assembly in its proper spiritual ground.<a name=201:11></a>

		I was saying there was no thought of His coming among men, as a man, to adorn man after the flesh, but to remove him.<a name=202:9></a> He is not going to take up the race as we know it; He is to bring in a race of men according to Himself, but ere He does that, He

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		You see what we have on our side in the Son of man.<a name=203:5></a> He removes, as "lifted up", all that lay upon us, to the glory of God, and those who believe have everlasting life.<a name=203:6></a> In chapter 5 He says He has authority to execute judgment, because He is the Son of man (verse 27).<a name=203:7></a> We see how, as on our side, God, as it were, would place in Him the power to execute judgment.<a name=203:8></a> It is God's gracious consideration for us, for He who died for us and is on our side will surely judge righteously.<a name=203:9></a> He executes judgment also because He is the Son of man.<a name=203:10></a> Thus we see how clearly and instructively the subject is opened up by this great evangelist, so that the Son of man should have His place in the hearts of those who know Him as the Son of God.<a name=203:11></a>

		"The Word was with God, and the Word was God" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#1:1">John  1:1</a>).<a name=204:10></a> How marvellous, therefore, is His word, "If then ye see the Son of man ascending up where he was before?<a name=204:11></a>" He has gone up as Man in all the dignity of His Person to where He was before, and He is there on our side.<a name=204:12></a> The Jews are referred to again in this connection in chapter 8.<a name=204:13></a> He says, "When ye shall have lifted up the Son of man" (verse 28).<a name=204:14></a> That is their side; they lifted Him up, and in consequence He is known.<a name=204:15></a> "Ye shall know", He says, "that I am he".<a name=204:16></a> The Spirit of God in this evangelist would lead us on to the apprehension of Him as Son of man, so that whilst we claim Him, and rightly according to God, as on our side, He is nevertheless One who ascends up where He was

Then, thirdly, "in a dream", etc. -- when intellect is in abeyance -- He speaks effectually to the heart. "The natural man does not receive", etc. He obstructs.

		Again, we have admired God's beneficent provision in the cities of refuge, for any who inadvertently slew his neighbour; but how greatly the account of this is enhanced, as well as our appreciation of the goodness that so planned the provision, when we discover that the provision is the divine Author Himself, come into this world as Man to die -- provision for all, particularly for those who slew Him "in ignorance" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#3:17">Acts  3:17</a>), as grace chose to regard the crime.<a name=224:4></a> He is the Forerunner, too, to lead the way to that provision; and the High Priest, whose continuance affords perpetual security.<a name=224:5></a> Furthermore, we discover that in the meanings of the cities' names is told out God's great salvation in Christ, read in order according to the divine placing of the cities in circuit over the whole land, beginning with Bezer and ending with Hebron.<a name=224:6></a>

		These scriptures speak of the past, the present and the future, and it is well to think of these three aspects of time.<a name=225:2></a> There are things in the past which we may wish we had never done.<a name=225:3></a> In the righteous-ness of God, through faith in Christ, those things can be settled to God's satisfaction.<a name=225:4></a> There are other past things that, in some measure, have been done in faithfulness to the Lord.<a name=225:5></a> Those are weighed in the balances, but in any case we know that we cannot alter the past.<a name=225:6></a> It has happened.<a name=225:7></a> It is well to have anything that troubles us settled in the presence of God, according to the standard of His righteousness.<a name=225:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		The speaking of God is a wonderful thing.<a name=226:5></a> He is speaking in Christ, and in the Spirit, and He would have a word for every one of us.<a name=226:6></a> Think of the grace and the peace of God flowing into our hearts!<a name=226:7></a> It is available, dear brethren.<a name=226:8></a> This is the attitude of Him who is on the throne, "who is".<a name=226:9></a> Oh!<a name=226:10></a> to be livingly and consciously in touch with God, to hear His word.<a name=226:11></a> The Lord was conscious that His own had been hearing the Father's word and they had answered to it, and they had kept it (<a href="../bible/John.htm#17">John  17</a>).<a name=226:12></a> So let us have the sense that there is One "who is" on the throne.<a name=226:13></a> He "is", and also He "was".<a name=226:14></a> Think of all that has entered into that, as you look back over the history of time, and the ways of God and all that He has done, taking up one and another, working out His great designs, all according to the divine pattern, and it is going through to the wonderful divine end.<a name=226:15></a> Not only He is, but He was; He ever will be, and He is to come.<a name=226:16></a>

		Spirits!<a name=227:1></a> We know, of course, that the Spirit of God is one blessed Person, but He is seen here in this figure as "the seven Spirits".<a name=227:2></a> It seems to me to supply the completeness of what is available from God Spirit-wise, God working through His Spirit and from the throne, the position of power and glory, dear brethren.<a name=227:3></a> Christ is the One who sits "on the right hand of the greatness on high" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#1:3">Hebrews  1:3</a>), but this is a beautiful verse and should attract our hearts.<a name=227:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"And from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness".<a name=227:5></a> What a beautiful blending there is in these verses of the power of each Person of the Godhead, and the divine interest in the testimony all through this time.<a name=227:6></a> That would be involved in these seven assemblies.<a name=227:7></a> As we know, the addresses cover the whole scope of church history, the first three covering historical phases, the last four going on to the end.<a name=227:8></a> The One who is on the throne is watching everything, and it comes out in the Lord's word in the addresses to each of the seven assemblies.<a name=227:9></a> But the One who is on the throne is interested.<a name=227:10></a> He <i>is</i>.<a name=227:11></a> I would encourage every one to have a link with the living God, the One who is at the present moment, and He is towards us.<a name=227:12></a> His affections are towards us in view of strengthening every one of us in His testimony at the present time.<a name=227:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		So let us have ears to hear too what the Spirit is saying to the assemblies, "the seven Spirits before his throne" no doubt linking with "what the Spirit says to the assemblies".<a name=227:14></a> So the Lord and the Spirit have things to say.<a name=227:15></a> God Himself has much to say to

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		God wants those who have put their faith in Christ to enjoy a sense of settled peace as to the past.<a name=228:11></a> Justification is that God views the believer as if he had never sinned.<a name=228:12></a> Only God could do that.<a name=228:13></a> The believer is in Christ, so God views you in that One, and in justifying you, He views you apart from the whole question of that past, every aspect of it settled through faith in a risen and glorified Saviour.<a name=228:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		I go on to speak a little about Paul.<a name=230:2></a> In the beginning of <a href="../bible/Philippians.htm#3">Philippians  3</a>he goes over his past, a past of which he was now ashamed.<a name=230:3></a> Paul says, "what things were gain to me these I counted, on account of Christ, loss" (verse 7).<a name=230:4></a> Then he goes on to say further, "and count them to be filth, that I may gain Christ".<a name=230:5></a> He had found deliverance in the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name=230:6></a> He had had a past, I suppose, that a religious man would have been proud of, but he came to it that it was all loss -- it was all "filth" in comparison with the glory of Christ.<a name=230:7></a> The grace of Christ had met him, the love of the Christ constrained him, "having judged this: that one died for all, then all have died" (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#5:14">2 Corinthians  5:14</a>).<a name=230:8></a> He had found another Man, and He had displaced Paul in his estimation of himself.<a name=230:9></a> May the light of Christ in glory lay hold of every one of us.<a name=230:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Paul's present joy now was "to know him" (verse 10), and that, I think, was the theme of the beloved apostle's life.<a name=230:11></a> God presents a living and glorified personal Saviour that we might come to know Him.<a name=230:12></a> When we come to know Him, we realise that there is far more to learn about Him -- there are unsearchable riches with Him -- and we should know Him a little better every day.<a name=230:13></a> The more you know Him, the more you will love Him; and the more you love Him, the more you will want to serve Him; and the more you will be set to find His people, His body here.<a name=230:14></a> That is what laid hold of Paul at the very point of his conversion: the Lord said, "Saul, Saul, why

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then Paul says, "Not that I have already obtained the prize, or am already perfected; but I pursue".<a name=231:5></a> How active he was!<a name=231:6></a> Let us be pursuers.<a name=231:7></a> Paul was in the race; this was the present as far as Paul was concerned.<a name=231:8></a> He had nothing here in this world; everything for him was in Christ in glory.<a name=231:9></a> All that his life consisted of was bound up with that blessed Man and His interests here, and he was earnest and active in service.<a name=231:10></a> He speaks elsewhere about buffeting his body (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#9:27">1 Corinthians  9:27</a>) -- Paul cared not for the things that the natural man would go in for; he was wholly taken up, captivated by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and in affection he would "pursue".<a name=231:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		"Seeing that also I have been taken possession of by Christ Jesus" -- another aspect of the beloved apostle's life at this point: he had been taken possession of by Christ Jesus, the Man in heaven.<a name=231:12></a> It is wonderful: divine ownership.<a name=231:13></a> Does every one here have a sense of that, that you have been taken possession of by Christ?<a name=231:14></a> He would have you wholly for Himself, with no divided objective, having a single eye for Christ -- He has given the lead in it Himself in taking possession of you.<a name=231:15></a> I say to every brother and sister here, including the younger brethren, Do not think you are out of it; the Lord wants you, and if you let Him, He can take

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then Paul speaks about "one thing -- forgetting the things behind".<a name=232:3></a> You see, the time comes when what is past loses its point.<a name=232:4></a> The goal was before Paul in a living and a vivid way, and he was forgetting the things behind.<a name=232:5></a> Sometimes we may need a bit of help to do that.<a name=232:6></a> We are often detained by the things behind, but the great thing is the things before.<a name=232:7></a> The present moment is the moment of opportunity to look on.<a name=232:8></a> It says, "Let thine eyes look right on .<a name=232:9></a>.<a name=232:10></a>.<a name=232:11></a> Ponder the path of thy feet" (<a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#4:25">Proverbs  4:25</a>, 26).<a name=232:12></a> The path that ends in glory, the path that ends with Christ, let us be pursuers in it and be like Paul: "forgetting the things behind, and stretching out to the things before, I pursue, looking towards the goal, for the prize of the calling on high of God in Christ Jesus".<a name=232:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This commanded Paul's life.<a name=232:14></a> He would not have been much interested in things here, what was happening amongst men.<a name=232:15></a> I suppose he might have taken account of it to some extent in relation to his prayers.<a name=232:16></a> He would be intelligent, of course, in relation to what God was doing, even with the nations, but Paul's great point was the coming glory.<a name=232:17></a> I would encourage every one in relation to that, to be filling out our lives at the present moment, that the coming glory might command us and that we may

	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#4">2 Timothy  4</a>Paul is just about at the end of his course.<a name=233:2></a> What a wonderful end was his!<a name=233:3></a> What is your end going to be, dear brother and dear sister?<a name=233:4></a> "<i>I</i> am already being poured out".<a name=233:5></a> All that he had, all that he was, was ready to be poured out for the Lord and in relation to His people.<a name=233:6></a> There was something in Paul that could be poured out, something of Christ in him that could be poured out.<a name=233:7></a> There is something in every believer that is for God's delight and pleasure.<a name=233:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then Paul adds three things.<a name=233:9></a> Firstly, "I have combated the good combat".<a name=233:10></a> Paul had been a warrior, not fighting battles for their own sake, but he had taken up things in relation to the Lord's interests and the deliverance of many of His people.<a name=233:11></a> If there was a battle in relation to the liberty of the saints, or whatever it was that the enemy was doing, Paul was involved.<a name=233:12></a> He would be in the forefront.<a name=233:13></a> He says, "I have fought with beasts in Ephesus" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#15:32">1 Corinthians  15:32</a>).<a name=233:14></a> Then there was what he fought with in Corinth too, and many other things.<a name=233:15></a> It is not just any combat; it is "the good combat".<a name=233:16></a> I think it would be what is needed in the Lord's work.<a name=233:17></a> The Lord is the great Warrior; He is the Man of war, when He needs to be.<a name=233:18></a> Can we say that any one of us, in any measure, has been in the conflict on the Lord's side, and have we some sense that we have combated the good combat?<a name=233:19></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Secondly, "I have finished the race".<a name=233:20></a> We saw Paul earlier at full speed in that race.<a name=233:21></a> Nothing would turn him aside, he had his eye on the goal, and here

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Thirdly, "I have kept the faith".<a name=234:7></a> I think that means the whole truth of Christianity.<a name=234:8></a> He had kept it, valued it, been marked by it and been directed by it.<a name=234:9></a> There is a great wealth of truth in Christianity, and can we all say that we have kept it?<a name=234:10></a> I believe there would be divine approval and blessing for those who could say, in measure, that they have kept the faith, and followed in the path that the Lord would have them to be in.<a name=234:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then Paul had his eye on "the crown", not for his own glory, but for the glory of Christ.<a name=234:12></a> Think of Christ's joy in being able to bestow "the crown of righteousness" on a believer!<a name=234:13></a> Paul had the sense that one was reserved for him and for "all who love his appearing".<a name=234:14></a> What joy there will be when Christ appears in His glory and takes up the reins of government!<a name=234:15></a> There will be those that come with Him, qualified to receive this crown of righteousness.<a name=234:16></a> Every bit of service for Christ here will be rewarded.<a name=234:17></a> We may not think much of our service, but the Lord measures it, whether it is much or little.<a name=234:18></a> The greater thing, of course, will be to see

		OBEYING THE GOSPEL
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is striking that in that beautiful treatise on the gospel of God -- the epistle to the Romans -- there should be a statement at the commencement that the gospel is presented "for <i>obedience of faith</i> among all the nations" (chapter 1: 5) and that, at its close, reference should be made to the "commandment of the eternal God, made known for <i>obedience of faith</i> to all nations" (chapter 16: 26).<a name=250:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The apostle Peter confirms this thought of obedience in connection with the gospel, for he asks, "what shall the end be of those who <i>obey</i> not the glad tidings of God?<a name=250:6></a>" (<a href="../bible/1Peter.htm#4:17">1 Peter  4:17</a>).<a name=250:7></a> While to the Thessalonians the apostle Paul writes of "vengeance on those who know not God, and those who do not <i>obey</i> the glad tidings of our Lord Jesus Christ" (<a href="../bible/2Thessalonians.htm#1:8">2 Thessalonians  1:8</a>), he also writes with sadness in <a href="../bible/Romans.htm#10">Romans  10</a>"they have not all <i>obeyed</i> the gospel" (verse 16).<a name=250:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The first evidence of obedience is that the gospel is BELIEVED, for it is only effective in those who receive it in faith.<a name=250:9></a> On the day of Pentecost there were three thousand who "gladly received his word" and "were baptised" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#2:41">Acts  2:41</a>, AV).<a name=250:10></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is the pleasure of God that the gospel, having been believed, should be ENJOYED by those who have obeyed it, for it is intimately bound up with joy.<a name=251:3></a> There is joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth; joy in the Shepherd's heart when, having found the lost sheep, He says, "Rejoice with me" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#15">Luke  15</a>), and there is joy in the heart of the believer in Jesus, when as the result of the gospel he is filled "with all joy and peace in believing .<a name=251:4></a>.<a name=251:5></a>.<a name=251:6></a> by the power of the Holy Spirit" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#15:13">Romans  15:13</a>).<a name=251:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		By the Holy Spirit alone is the believer filled with joy, for "the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#5:22">Galatians  5:22</a>).<a name=251:8></a> The secret of joy is thus beautifully told in <a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#1:12">Ephesians  1:12</a>, 13, in which the apostle, writing of those who have "pre-trusted in the Christ", adds, "in whom <i>ye</i> also have trusted, having heard the word of the truth, the glad tidings of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, ye have been sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise".<a name=251:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is by the Spirit's power that the promises of God are so faithfully fulfilled and the truths of the gospel are PROVED by those who obey it.<a name=251:10></a> That assuring promise of God that "their sins and their lawlessnesses I will never remember any more" (<a href="../bible/Hebrews.htm#10:17">Hebrews  10:17</a>) is proved by the believer in the

		conscious knowledge of the forgiveness of sins.<a name=252:1></a> The promised gift of the Holy Spirit is proved as "The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit, that we are children of God" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#8:16">Romans  8:16</a>), and as "the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which has been given to us" (<a href="../bible/Romans.htm#5:5">Romans  5:5</a>).<a name=252:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But the gospel is not given that it may remain hidden in the hearts of Christians, but that it might be TESTIFIED, not by angels, but by those who have obeyed it and are enjoying and proving its reality and power.<a name=252:3></a> The commission given to Saul of Tarsus, after he had obeyed the gospel, was "to testify the glad tidings of the grace of God" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20:24">Acts  20:24</a>), while the other apostles were told to "Go ye and stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#5:20">Acts  5:20</a>).<a name=252:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The personal testimony of individuals to individuals, though more testing, both as to heart and ability, is oftentimes more effective than even public preaching, and this means is being greatly used of God today to awaken many to the realisation of their need of the gospel.<a name=252:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		To all who obey the gospel the public proclamation is of great interest, for it is divinely ordained that the gospel should be PREACHED, and "God has been pleased by the foolishness of the preaching to save those that believe" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#1:21">1 Corinthians  1:21</a>).<a name=252:6></a> The Lord said to His disciples, "Go into all the world, and preach the glad tidings to all the creation" (<a href="../bible/Mark.htm#16:15">Mark  16:15</a>).<a name=252:7></a> But it is necessary that the preacher should go as one "sent"; for "how shall they hear

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Those who would go forth to preach will find much instruction and encouragement in the consideration of the preachings recorded in Scripture, and especially in considering the public utterances of our Lord and Master, who displayed the manner and the spirit in which He would have His servants to proclaim God's great salvation.<a name=253:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Perhaps the most distinctive and important present result of obeying the gospel is the transformation of the lives of those who obey.<a name=253:5></a> By a consistent and subject life the gospel is ADORNED and the preaching endorsed.<a name=253:6></a> Who would have supposed that a poor down-trodden slave could adorn the glad tidings?<a name=253:7></a> Yet the believing slaves were exhorted "to be subject to their own masters, to make themselves acceptable in everything; not gainsaying; not robbing their masters, but shewing all good fidelity, that they may adorn the teaching which is of our Saviour God in all things" (<a href="../bible/Titus.htm#2:9">Titus  2:9</a>, 10).<a name=253:8></a>

		In <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10">1 Corinthians  10</a>we have three classes, or companies, of people brought before us, which are distinguished the one from the other religiously.<a name=274:6></a> They are Jews, Gentiles, and the church of God.<a name=274:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(1) The <i>Jews</i>, as we well know, were God's earthly people.<a name=274:8></a> At the beginning of their history as a nation Israel was delivered from Egyptian slavery, and at length they were established as a kingdom under the reign of David in the land of Canaan.<a name=274:9></a> For their wickedness and idolatry when in that land Israel was taken captive into Assyria, and Judah to Babylon; but in His mercy God brought back a remnant of Judah from Babylon in the days of Ezra and Nehemiah.<a name=274:10></a> The fervour which at first marked this Jewish remnant soon abated, however, and a cold, lifeless, though fanatic religiousness settled upon the once favoured people.<a name=274:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But all through their history they had had the great distinction of having the oracles of God: they were the custodians of the written word.<a name=274:12></a> Commands had been given by God through Moses as to sacrifice as well as to moral law, and a system of earthly

		religion existed, however much it became neglected and perverted in practice.<a name=275:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(2) The <i>Gentiles</i> were nations other than Israel.<a name=275:2></a> They were characteristically idolatrous.<a name=275:3></a> They, too, had a system of religion, differing according to their national god.<a name=275:4></a> But the systems were idolatrous, and we are shown the secret of the power of idolatry in this chapter which tells us that the Gentiles sacrificed to "demons, and not to God" (verse 20).<a name=275:5></a> Behind the idol, influencing men's minds by dark and debased superstition, was a demon.<a name=275:6></a> Satan used idolatry to satisfy man's religious cravings and keep him away from God.<a name=275:7></a> Gentile sacrifices were idolatrous.<a name=275:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(3) We have seen, in a previous paper, that after the birth, the death and the resurrection of the Lord Jesus -- indeed, after Jesus had been glorified -- another class of persons existed.<a name=275:9></a> The <i>church of God</i> was formed by the coming of the Holy Spirit.<a name=275:10></a> The church was not a nation, but was a company "called out", as the word "church" implies -- called out from all nations, called into "one body".<a name=275:11></a> This company, or class of people, was also distinguished religiously and by their sacrifice.<a name=275:12></a> Not an oft repeated one, as Jewish sacrifices had been, but a sacrifice <i>once</i> offered -- Christ's sacrifice of Himself upon the cross.<a name=275:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have gone into these distinctions in some detail in order to make clear the idea of fellowship.<a name=275:14></a> The Jewish system had its sacrifice and its altar.<a name=275:15></a> And a person who partook of the sacrifices was identified

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		A Gentile, who ate of meat which had been offered in sacrifice to an idol, was associated thus with idolatry.<a name=276:3></a> It was an idolatrous bond and the idolater was identified with his idol sacrifice.<a name=276:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In <a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10">1 Corinthians  10</a>the apostle applies this principle to Christianity, and shows that it equally existed there and in a more emphatic way.<a name=276:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The sacrifice of Christ was once offered and would never be repeated.<a name=276:6></a> It stood alone as a complete remedy for man's ruin, an abundant answer to the question of sin.<a name=276:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But while there was not, and could not be, a repetition of this sacrifice, the Lord Jesus had instituted a supper on the night of His betrayal for a remembrance of Himself.<a name=276:8></a> And the bread and the cup of this supper symbolised His body given and His blood shed and were, indeed, a memorial of Himself in death.<a name=276:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The bread was only bread and remained such, and the cup of wine remained what it actually was; but they were the communion of His death.<a name=276:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord had requested His own to remember Him by partaking of this supper.<a name=276:11></a> But in so doing believers necessarily identified themselves with His death, of which the supper was the repeated memorial.<a name=276:12></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The sacrifice of Christ had abolished the need of the repeated sacrifices of the Mosaic law.<a name=277:5></a> They were but types to the Christian, for whom Christ was the great Antitype.<a name=277:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Christian had no altar of a material kind.<a name=277:7></a> But he had a fellowship and was a participator, in common with every other Christian, in christian privileges, of which the death of Christ was the foundation.<a name=277:8></a> And in partaking of the memorials of Christ's death he avowedly identified himself with this fellowship.<a name=277:9></a> It was Christian fellowship, in contrast to what was associated with the Jewish altar or idol temples.<a name=277:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Corinthians were in the midst of idolatry, and therefore we have details in chapter 10 which are too plain to need remark.<a name=277:11></a> "The earth is the Lord's" (verse 26).<a name=277:12></a> Nothing that denied that could be allowed.<a name=277:13></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		But this is not all.<a name=277:14></a> The question of fellowship does not only apply to eating in an idol temple, or to the outward forms of idolatry.<a name=277:15></a> It touches everything.<a name=277:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is very evident that the person, whether Jew, Gentile or Christian, was always, professedly, in communion with that with which he was identified.<a name=277:17></a>

		evil-doer".<a name=281:1></a> The present moment is a time of suffering.<a name=281:2></a> Suffering has characterised the testimony of God all down the ages.<a name=281:3></a> It commenced in Abel, who suffered for the truth's sake, and it has marked the testimony of God in greater or less degree all along and will continue to do so until the Lord comes.<a name=281:4></a> And Paul was suffering, "even unto bonds as an evil-doer"; "but", he says, "the word of God is not bound".<a name=281:5></a> The Lord is on high in the place of supreme power and authority and, the Spirit of God being here, the word of God is not bound.<a name=281:6></a> The word of God will go on and will accomplish whatever God has in mind to be accomplished through it.<a name=281:7></a> So in <a href="../bible/Acts.htm#12">Acts  12</a>after it speaks of the death of Herod who had put James, the brother of John, to death, we read, "But the word of God grew and spread itself" (verse 24), as though there is a certain power connected with the word itself, apart from the activities of man, that causes it to spread itself.<a name=281:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I turn to the two scriptures in Jeremiah because I believe that they have peculiar application to the present time.<a name=281:9></a> The first one, this special word to Baruch (who, I think we may gather, was probably a young man), was given him in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, the king of Judah.<a name=281:10></a> That is to say, it was about eighteen years before the final overthrow of Jerusalem and the final captivity of those who were left in it, after eighteen months of famine with all the horrors of a famine in a besieged city.<a name=281:11></a> What a time it was, that final overthrow of Jerusalem!<a name=281:12></a> It was the final pouring out

		of God's wrath upon that with which He had connected His name, which had proved utterly unfaithful, and that has a strong analogy with the present moment, for Christendom is about to come under the most terrible judgment from God.<a name=282:1></a> It has professed the name of Christ and has proved worldly, and worse than worldly; it is characterised by every form of evil.<a name=282:2></a> It is well that we should have this in mind, because God is not likely to prosper things in the world.<a name=282:3></a> Just as He took off the chariot wheels of the Egyptians (<a href="../bible/Exodus.htm#14:25">Exodus  14:25</a>), so I believe He will more and more weaken this world in the efforts it makes to hold His people captive, and its judgment in an intense form is absolutely inevitable.<a name=282:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And hence the word to Baruch is, "Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, what I have built do I overthrow, and what I have planted I pluck up, even this whole land.<a name=282:5></a> And seekest thou great things for thyself?<a name=282:6></a>" God knew what was in that young man's heart.<a name=282:7></a> He says, "seekest thou great things for thyself?<a name=282:8></a> seek <i>them not</i>; for behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith Jehovah; but thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou shalt go".<a name=282:9></a> Baruch had identified himself with the testimony; he had committed himself to Jeremiah; he had served Jeremiah in writing his words for him, so that he was in everything committed to the testimony, and yet God saw in that man's heart that there was just a tendency to seek great things for himself, and He says, "seek them not".<a name=282:10></a> He will get through as he commits himself to the testimony and goes on

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in the other case (<a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#39">Jeremiah  39</a>) this word to Jeremiah came even later than the word to Baruch, as far as we can gather.<a name=283:3></a> It came apparently when the final judgment upon the city was immediately impending and the word is, "Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for good, and they shall come to pass before thy face in that day".<a name=283:4></a> But then there is the word to Ebed-melech: "I will deliver thee in that day, saith Jehovah; and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid; for I will certainly save thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thou shalt have thy life for a prey" -- exactly the same expression as was used to Baruch.<a name=283:5></a> "Thou shalt have thy life for a prey; for thou hast put thy confidence in me".<a name=283:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Ebed-melech had also identified himself with the testimony for the moment; he was known as a sympathiser with Jeremiah, one who had spoken for him before the king and had been used to draw him up from the dungeon, and God speaks to him in a very similar way, not to look for any improvement in conditions in the city, but he should "have thy life for a prey; for thou hast put thy confidence in me".<a name=283:7></a> And so I believe that at the present time, till the Lord comes, it is for us to see, old and young alike, that we thoroughly commit ourselves to the word of God and the testimony, whatever it involves, and go

	<div class="paragraph">
		As we go on on these lines we shall be increasingly free to support the testimony of God in all its features, and we shall have the great encouragement that God has pledged Himself to see us through, and we shall be seen through until the Lord comes.<a name=284:4></a> May we be helped in this matter!<a name=284:5></a> The more we have the Lord's outlook on things and are affected by it, the more we shall be in full unity.<a name=284:6></a> One great element of unity is that we have all the same thing before us and all think the same thing.<a name=284:7></a> If we do that there will be unity.<a name=284:8></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		In Cyprus we learn that the natural must not dominate the spiritual, but the spiritual the natural.<a name=285:3></a> Paul said to Barnabas, "Let us return now and visit the brethren in every city .<a name=285:4></a>.<a name=285:5></a>.<a name=285:6></a>" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#15:36">Acts  15:36</a>).<a name=285:7></a> It was a brotherly proposal, but Barnabas wished to take Mark with them, whereas Paul thought this not good, seeing he had abandoned them on their previous journey.<a name=285:8></a> Now Mark was the nephew of Barnabas, and the latter evidently allowed his natural affection and relationship to govern him.<a name=285:9></a> Warm feeling arose between Barnabas and Paul, and Barnabas taking Mark sailed away to Cyprus, the place of his birth.<a name=285:10></a> Paul, choosing Silas, departed in another direction, but they went forth committed by the brethren to the grace of God.<a name=285:11></a> Thus two believers, Barnabas and Mark, an uncle and a nephew, move in independence.<a name=285:12></a> Thank God they were recovered later!<a name=285:13></a> Paul later spoke of Mark as being profitable (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#4:11">2 Timothy  4:11</a>), but for a time these erring ones were in some measure lost to the testimony of our Lord.<a name=285:14></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		Cyprus, thus, would teach us not to allow what is natural to govern us in our service to God.<a name=285:15></a> A John Mark might be seriously damaged in his spiritual career through being put into a position for which he is not spiritually qualified, and a Barnabas, though a son of consolation, might be crippled in his christian service by allowing natural relationships to dominate

		I turn now to the scriptures we read.<a name=305:17></a> The speaking of each of the three persons brought before us in these passages is dependent upon their having been hearers.<a name=305:18></a> I want to stress that.<a name=305:19></a> Their speaking is dependent upon their hearing, or, in Agur's case, on his reading, for he speaks in <a href="../bible/Proverbs.htm#30">Proverbs  30</a>as one who has read all the preceding twenty-nine chapters.<a name=305:20></a> The first nine chapters are the "Proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel"; then from chapter 10 to 24, we have "The Proverbs of Solomon" -- not here the king, but the man.<a name=305:21></a> Then from 25 to 29, they are the "proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah transcribed".<a name=305:22></a> I would ask young believers, Have you ever thought of that?<a name=305:23></a> The men

		of Hezekiah transcribed these proverbs of Solomon; see to it that you copy only what has been rightly presented to you, but do not fail in the copying of it, and the spreading of it, if it is of value.<a name=306:1></a> These men of Hezekiah recognised what was of value and they copied out these proverbs.<a name=306:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In chapter 30 you have a man, as I gather, who is in the good of the other twenty-nine chapters.<a name=306:3></a> What does he say in the light of them?<a name=306:4></a> There is only one thing which could be said in the light of what Solomon has presented, and that is what Agur says, "I have neither learned wisdom, nor have I the knowledge of the Holy" (verse 3).<a name=306:5></a> He says, "Truly <i>I</i> am more stupid than any one" (verse 2); he does not say <i>as</i> stupid, but I am <i>more</i> stupid.<a name=306:6></a> He is like John the Baptist; he says, as it were, I am but a voice.<a name=306:7></a> Saul of Tarsus says, "To me, less than the least of all saints, has this grace been given, to announce among the nations, the glad tidings of the unsearchable riches of the Christ" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#3:8">Ephesians  3:8</a>).<a name=306:8></a> Saul of Tarsus -- no mean city -- has become Paul the little.<a name=306:9></a> Well, that is the conclusion Agur comes to, he is less than the least.<a name=306:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The name Agur, as I understand, means an Assembler -- one who has feelings and instincts in regard to assembling.<a name=306:11></a> I wish every believer had those feelings!<a name=306:12></a> There are many believers who prefer to stay at home, and there are many who go on in circumstances where Christ is dishonoured, and where there is no true idea of assembling according to His mind.<a name=306:13></a> But Agur is an assembler, yet he begins by speaking first about himself: "Truly <i>I</i> am more

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then Agur began to ask questions, and that is a very fine method of making progress.<a name=307:15></a> It is said of the Lord Jesus when a Boy of twelve, He was in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, "hearing them and asking them questions" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#2:46">Luke  2:46</a>).<a name=307:16></a> So Agur begins to ask questions, and I believe he is conscious of getting an answer, and when he has his answer, he looks abroad and sees four generations upon the earth who have not one honourable feature among them (verses 11 - 14).<a name=307:17></a> They are men who are

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then he goes on to look into the principles which govern the world, those dark unholy principles that govern nations, and powers, and men -- even religious men -- and he describes them under four figures: "The way of an eagle in the heavens, the way of a serpent upon a rock, the way of a ship in the midst of the sea, and the way of a man with a maid" (verse 19).<a name=308:3></a> These are not commendable things, though some have tried to make them so.<a name=308:4></a> But Scripture adds, "Such is the way of adulterous woman" (verse 20) -- <i>that</i> is not commendable!<a name=308:5></a> These figures all represent a lack of transparency.<a name=308:6></a> You do not know what an eagle is doing, nor when it will swoop on its prey.<a name=308:7></a> You never know what may overtake a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid is a hidden snare; and a way of a serpent on a rock is untraceable.<a name=308:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		All these things speak of what lacks transparency; and Agur sees these things.<a name=308:9></a> He is little upon the earth, but be is becoming exceeding wise.<a name=308:10></a>

		We are told that "he takes hold of the seed of Abraham".<a name=309:2></a> In becoming Man, He took up a special relationship with the faith family -- with what God owned as having a link with Himself.<a name=309:3></a> There were features about that family which were of God, though every member of it had been by nature a child of wrath, even as the rest.<a name=309:4></a> But faith having come in, there was that in them which was not of the fallen man, but which had its origin in God.<a name=309:5></a> Christ could take hold of that, for it was suitable to Him; we might say that it was kindred to Him.<a name=309:6></a>

		But the bread, or loaf, is likewise full of teaching.<a name=318:2></a> While the broken bread refers to Christ's body given for us on the cross, the <i>one</i> loaf unbroken has a striking allusion to the church itself -- the body of Christ.<a name=318:3></a> We read: "we, being many, are one loaf, one body; for we all partake of that one loaf" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10:17">1 Corinthians  10:17</a>).<a name=318:4></a> It was after the Lord had broken the loaf that He gave it to His disciples and said, "This is my body which is given for you" (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#22:19">Luke  22:19</a>).<a name=318:5></a> But the "one loaf" unbroken refers to the church -- the one body.<a name=318:6></a> It is this fellowship, this common participation of all Christians as one body, which is referred to.<a name=318:7></a>

		This being so, it must be evident that the act of taking the Supper is neither individual nor isolated, but can only be carried out in the recognition of the communion of the body of Christ.<a name=318:8></a> "We, being many, are one loaf, one body", says the apostle.<a name=318:9></a> Though there may be many persons, or more correctly members of the body, our act of partaking of that one loaf confesses a unity which abidingly exists.<a name=318:10></a> A person cannot partake otherwise, for the bread which we break is the communion of the body of Christ.<a name=318:11></a>

		The thought of fellowship and the partaking of the Supper are indissolubly linked together, and we can only regard as unintelligent many ideas which are about today which refer to the Lord's supper as a purely isolated and individual act.<a name=318:13></a> It is just the

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We may have occasion to refer to this point again when considering the subject of the Lord's supper itself.<a name=319:3></a> It must suffice here to remark that the act of taking the Supper commits the participator to christian fellowship.<a name=319:4></a> He is to be true to this always.<a name=319:5></a> He is false if he denies in his practice at any time what he professes in his communion.<a name=319:6></a> If he avers a unity to exist in partaking of the "one loaf", he cannot honestly deny this unity at other times.<a name=319:7></a> It is abidingly true.<a name=319:8></a>

		The exercise I have is to call attention to the great importance of loving Christ.<a name=321:1></a> I want to connect it with the advantages that accrue from it, especially that it leads us into the benefit of His headship.<a name=321:2></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One feels a peculiar exercise as to the headship of Christ, and what I would remark is that, aside from loving Christ, souls get no direct advantage from it.<a name=321:3></a> I use the word direct, for you may get indirect advantage from it although your love for Christ may be very little.<a name=321:4></a> You may get indirect advantage by observing others who profit by it, who are in the good of it, but it is quite obvious that each believer should know the headship of Christ.<a name=321:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Each believer who has the Spirit is in the body, and we read in regard of Christ as Head, "from whom all the body, ministered to and united together by the joints and bands, increases with the increase of God" (<a href="../bible/Colossians.htm#2:19">Colossians  2:19</a>).<a name=321:6></a> Therefore, every believer ought to be in direct relation with Christ in his own soul, in order that he should get the benefit of the headship, and correspondingly contribute to the whole.<a name=321:7></a> Our contribution may be little or it may be much.<a name=321:8></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The same may be said of Mary Magdalene.<a name=322:3></a> Look at the contribution she made to the disciples as re-corded in <a href="../bible/John.htm#20">John  20</a>.<a name=322:4></a> For the moment, she eclipsed even the eleven; she contributed to such an extent as to give them light as to their new relationship and position.<a name=322:5></a> I call attention to these two instances so that you may see the great gain of headship.<a name=322:6></a> Whether you have a meagre apprehension of it or a very full apprehension of it, there is gain for you and there is gain for the company, for you become a contributor.<a name=322:7></a> One would feel extremely poor and ashamed not to be a contributor in some sense.<a name=322:8></a> Indeed, we know that to each one of us has been given grace according to the measure of the gift of the Christ, and it is that we should be contributors.<a name=322:9></a>

		Well now, my point is for the moment to show you that it depends on love for Christ, and I selected John's gospel because he says more about love than any of the evangelists.<a name=322:10></a> He says more too, perhaps, about hatred than any of them; he is a man of extremes, in a sense, and he presents the things that he speaks of in their absoluteness.<a name=322:11></a> In speaking of love in contrast to hatred, he intimates clearly that love is according to Christ and that hatred characterises Antichrist.<a name=322:12></a> It seems to me that Judas is the

	<div class="paragraph">
		representative of the anti-christian spirit; whereas, in a modest way, John presents the disciple "whom Jesus loved" as the expression of the spirit of Christianity.<a name=323:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In view of the character of <a href="../bible/John.htm#13">John  13</a>, it is very suited that these two opposites should appear in it.<a name=323:2></a> I am not saying that other New Testament writers do not speak of love; they all do; Paul is very express about it; he says (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#16:22">1 Corinthians  16:22</a>), "If any one love not the Lord Jesus Christ let him be Anathema Maranatha".<a name=323:3></a> Very strong language this!<a name=323:4></a> It is his way, in one sense, of expressing his estimate of Christ; he had wonderful affection for Christ.<a name=323:5></a> He is speaking to the Corinthians.<a name=323:6></a> Amongst them, alas!<a name=323:7></a> there were evidently non-lovers of Christ.<a name=323:8></a> You will not remain long a non-lover; if you are that now, you may presently become a hater of Christ.<a name=323:9></a> Hence the apostle is very pronounced in reminding you of the curse.<a name=323:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In writing to the Ephesians he does not suggest there were any amongst them who did not love Christ.<a name=323:11></a> He had a very great experience of the spiritual affections at Ephesus.<a name=323:12></a> You will all remember how, having called the elders, they embraced him (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20:37">Acts  20:37</a>); that is very beautiful!<a name=323:13></a> They loved him.<a name=323:14></a> They felt most of all, it says, that they should see his face no more.<a name=323:15></a> It was a scene to touch the heart.<a name=323:16></a> They loved the apostle, and this was really an evidence that they loved Christ.<a name=323:17></a> He does not therefore suggest that there was a non-lover amongst them; he rather emphasises in his epistle that they had faith in Christ Jesus and love, not only

	<div class="paragraph">
		for him, but for all the saints.<a name=324:1></a> It is a wonderful thing to love Christ and all the saints.<a name=324:2></a> At the end of his epistle the apostle remarks, "Grace with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption" (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#6:24">Ephesians  6:24</a>).<a name=324:3></a> He suggests there the possibility of the existence of love for Christ in insincerity.<a name=324:4></a> I am not prepared to define how it works out in the individual, but the apostle suggests it, and I mention it so that we may inquire what is the character of our love.<a name=324:5></a> Is there an element of corruption there?<a name=324:6></a> He pronounced his benediction on those who loved Christ in "incorruption".<a name=324:7></a> Remember that word.<a name=324:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So the apostle Paul treats of love very extensively; but, as I was remarking, John uses the word more frequently; he weaves it into the whole fabric of his writings, and on the opposite side you have presented the anti-christian spirit, and Judas is the father of it.<a name=324:9></a> The reason why I say that Judas is the father of the anti-christian spirit is that he was with Christ, and so had the opportunity of knowing Him.<a name=324:10></a> Having known the Lord, he left Him and betrayed Him.<a name=324:11></a> One cannot be an antichrist unless one knows Christ in some sense; you know in some sense what you are objecting to.<a name=324:12></a> Hence the characteristic of Antichrist is, "they went out" (<a href="../bible/1John.htm#2:19">1 John  2:19</a>).<a name=324:13></a> Judas went out.<a name=324:14></a> We have the word, "he went out", meaning that he left the circle in which the love of Christ was active.<a name=324:15></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The <i>heel</i> is found early in the Scriptures.<a name=325:17></a> Satan is the author of that sort of activity: "thou shalt crush his heel" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#3:15">Genesis  3:15</a>), God said to him.<a name=325:18></a> It is well to be reminded that he who acts in that way has his <i>head</i> bruised; it is inevitable.<a name=325:19></a> "He shall crush thy head", that is Satan's annulment.<a name=325:20></a> The tribe of Dan is like "a horned snake on the path, which biteth the horse's heels, so that the rider falleth backwards" (<a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#49:17">Genesis  49:17</a>).<a name=325:21></a> That is anti-christian.<a name=325:22></a> As you know, Jacob himself had learned the lesson, for he was a 'heel-holder' (see footnote <i>c</i>, <a href="../bible/Genesis.htm#25:26">Genesis  25:26</a>), one who operates in the rear.<a name=325:23></a> That thread runs right through Scripture; it is the anti-christian thread, and Judas is the exponent of it.<a name=325:24></a> He had been in the company of the Lord for some three years, so that he had known

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Well now, there was the disciple "whom Jesus loved"; he was not acting from the back, he was on Jesus' bosom.<a name=326:4></a> He is reposing in confidence, the confidence begotten of known affection; that was John.<a name=326:5></a> He is pleased modestly to regard himself as the disciple whom Jesus loved, and he rewards the Lord, as it were, for the place He gave to him, for he never tires of calling attention to the love of Christ.<a name=326:6></a> In the next chapter Judas says: "Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself to us and not to the world?<a name=326:7></a>" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#14:22">John  14:22</a>); as to this disciple, the apostle carefully says he was "not the Iscariot" -- it was another Judas.<a name=326:8></a> Thank God, there was another Judas.<a name=326:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As I was saying, love for Christ is the great antidote to the anti-christian spirit, hence chapter 14 enlarges on the great advantage of loving Christ; "He that has my commandments and keeps them, he it is that loves me" (verse 21), and further the Lord says, "If any one love me, he will keep my word" (verse 23).<a name=326:10></a> These are tests: keeping His commandments and His word.<a name=326:11></a> Besides the former, all the wonderful communications of Christ are treasured in the heart of the lover of Christ.<a name=326:12></a>

		Now in turning to Colossians what I wanted to point out was that the Father has translated us into the kingdom of that One, the Son of His love.<a name=326:13></a> What a kingdom that is!<a name=326:14></a> Think of rule in the hands of the

		Ahab and all Israel were the enemies of Elijah (chapter 18: 10); but God was his friend, and in each step that he took in fidelity to Jehovah he learnt the fidelity of Jehovah to him.<a name=340:10></a> By this means he was more and more strengthened for the mission on which he was about to be employed (chapter 18: 1).<a name=340:11></a> God sent him to be with a poor widow who entertained

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We see then in chapter 17 the simple and entire obedience of Elijah.<a name=341:4></a> Whether Jehovah sent him to a brook to be fed by ravens; whether he was sent to a widow during the famine; whether he was sent before his real enemy Ahab (chapter 18), he made no objection, but counting on Jehovah he did that which he was ordered.<a name=341:5></a> He was nevertheless a man subject to the same passions and to the same infirmities as ourselves (<a href="../bible/James.htm#5:17">James  5:17</a>, 18); but he had much of that faith the power of which is infinite.<a name=341:6></a> By it he could say that there should be no rain, and there was none; by it he could raise the son of the widow, and overcome Ahab the king and the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal.<a name=341:7></a> These circumstances show us clearly that Elijah was in the place where one is blessed, namely, in that of obedience.<a name=341:8></a> Men were his enemies; Ahab had sent everywhere persons to find him out: but Jehovah was his refuge, and he had learnt to trust in Him.<a name=341:9></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Let us read now verses 7 - 11.<a name=342:11></a> All the thoughts of Obadiah were about his master, whom he dreaded; but all the thoughts of Elijah were centred on Jehovah, his only Master.<a name=342:12></a> The superiority of his position to that of Obadiah is further indicated by this circumstance, that the latter fell on his face before Elijah when he met him (verse 7).<a name=342:13></a> And when Elijah tells him to go and announce to Ahab, Obadiah is all frightened.<a name=342:14></a> Yet Obadiah was a child of God; he had even hid the prophets; but he had no strength whatever to bear testimony to Jehovah, because he was associated with evil.<a name=342:15></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As to Elijah, he could say fearlessly to Ahab and to all the people, "If Jehovah be God, follow him"(verse 21).<a name=342:16></a> Whence did, therefore, this boldness and power come, as seen in Elijah, a poor and weak man, who had been straitened to this point, that he depended upon ravens and upon a widow for his food?<a name=342:17></a> From the fact that he stood aloof from the apostasy, that he lived by faith and had a single eye fixed upon his God.<a name=342:18></a> Oh!<a name=342:19></a> how far better his position was than that of Obadiah.<a name=342:20></a>

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We know how Elijah triumphed over his enemies: there is therefore no need of repeating the issue of the scene on Carmel.<a name=343:3></a> But let us observe that, when Elijah prayed Jehovah that He might give him the victory, what he asked was, that it might be known that Jehovah was God (chapter 18: 37).<a name=343:4></a> All the desire of his heart consisted in these two things, that Jehovah might be glorified, and that His people might know Him.<a name=343:5></a> There was not in him the least desire to lift himself up, to exalt himself; it mattered not to him if he was nothing, provided that God might be glorified and His people brought to know Him.<a name=343:6></a> Oh!<a name=343:7></a> that the same desire may be in us, and that all thought of vainglory may be cast far, far away.<a name=343:8></a>

		Let us now read chapter 19.<a name=343:9></a> Poor Elijah!<a name=343:10></a> he had a lesson to learn, which we ourselves, weak and poor as we are, need to learn also.<a name=343:11></a> When Elijah stood before Jehovah, he could by Jehovah's power stop or send rain to the earth, raise up the widow's son, etc.<a name=343:12></a> But when he stood, not now before Jehovah, but before Jezebel, he was then without strength, and this ungodly woman was able to cause him to fear.<a name=343:13></a> Downcast, Elijah therefore goes into the wilderness, sits down under a broom-bush and asks Jehovah to take away his life (verse 4).<a name=343:14></a> How different he is here from what he was in the chapter before!<a name=343:15></a> How little

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So is it with us.<a name=344:2></a> We are downcast, discouraged and weak in ourselves as soon as we fail to live in faith and prayer, and then we cannot say, as Elijah in chapter 18: 15, "Jehovah .<a name=344:3></a>.<a name=344:4></a>.<a name=344:5></a> before whom I stand".<a name=344:6></a>

		In chapter 17 Elijah by faith could make the widow's oil and meal last; but here he is weak, and needs that an angel come to strengthen him and give him some food.<a name=344:7></a> (Read chapter 19: 5 - 8.<a name=344:8></a>) He eats, drinks, and, like a man without strength, lies down.<a name=344:9></a> But Jehovah sends the angel back again, for He is plentiful in grace and mercy; He watches over all our ways and feeds our souls according to all our wants and according to all our circumstances.<a name=344:10></a> Jehovah therefore bore with Elijah and succoured him, and it is also what He is with respect to us.<a name=344:11></a> As He was afflicted in all the affliction of His people (<a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#63:9">Isaiah  63:9</a>), so is He with us in ours now.<a name=344:12></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		What we have said on these chapters is very incomplete; but we believe that the chief thing is to bring out of them the principles calculated to give the intelligence of what the chapters contain.<a name=345:4></a> Let us therefore be mindful of avoiding the position of Obadiah and the seven thousand, who were taking their ease in the midst of apostasy, but who were without strength to bear testimony against evil.<a name=345:5></a> Let us also remember that, though Elijah was despised and rejected of men, he was nevertheless in the place of blessing.<a name=345:6></a> And if like himself we are brought to realise our weakness, let us remember that communion with the Lord can alone give us afresh zeal and devotedness and joy.<a name=345:7></a>

		I wish to say a word on spiritual energy, feeling that it is a matter that may be especially needed amongst us at the end of the dispensation.<a name=346:3></a> Spiritual energy is needed if we are to follow up swiftly light from God as knowing God, so that we are found with the ear to hear and the eye to see.<a name=346:4></a> The time that may remain, in the period that we have spoken of as the days of our receiving up, may be very short.<a name=346:5></a> There is much to be done, and it calls for energy in those who are prepared to put their hand to it.<a name=346:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I would stress the qualification of spiritual energy, for, in the work of the Lord there is to be no other kind.<a name=346:7></a> There may be much fleshly energy and zeal in the world around us, but let us remember that the power for everything in the divine realm lies in the Holy Spirit.<a name=346:8></a> If we aspire to have part in this kind of activity in an energetic way, it must be as those who are prepared to come under divine control, under the lordship of Christ and under the practical influence of the Spirit.<a name=346:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We have the most affecting examples before us, first of all, in divine Persons Themselves.<a name=346:10></a> In the Old Testament we have the allusion to God "rising early and sending" the prophets (<a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#7:25">Jeremiah  7:25</a>; <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#25:3">Jeremiah  25:3</a>; <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#26:5">Jeremiah  26:5</a>; <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#35:15">Jeremiah  35:15</a>; <a href="../bible/Jeremiah.htm#44:4">Jeremiah  44:4</a>), showing how this thought of energy is set out even in God Himself in relation to the needs of the time.<a name=346:11></a> We see it touchingly set out in the life of Jesus, those days full of activity in the realm of testimony, and those nights of communion alone

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As we read through the gospels we are impressed with the quantity and volume of work that was compressed into those days, and I suppose but a fraction of the activities of the life of Jesus is recorded in the holy Word.<a name=347:3></a> In grace He would go on to secure the woman at the well at Sychar, although wearied with the way that He had come (<a href="../bible/John.htm#4:6">John  4:6</a>).<a name=347:4></a> And yet the work goes on, and in that very chapter the Lord takes in hand the education of the disciples.<a name=347:5></a> They were postponing the harvest, but the Lord says to them, "I say to you .<a name=347:6></a>.<a name=347:7></a>.<a name=347:8></a> the fields .<a name=347:9></a>.<a name=347:10></a>.<a name=347:11></a> are already white to harvest .<a name=347:12></a>.<a name=347:13></a>.<a name=347:14></a> others have laboured, and ye have entered into their labours" (<a href="../bible/John.htm#4:35">John  4:35</a>, 38).<a name=347:15></a> The Lord spoke -- I say with the greatest reverence -- as the great Labourer Himself, for He had that day gathered in a sheaf, as it were, for the worship of God, and then as He says in John's gospel (chapter 5: 17), "My Father worketh hitherto and I work".<a name=347:16></a>

	<div class="paragraph">

	<div class="paragraph">
		These passages have come to mind as setting it out in certain persons and in certain settings, and I begin with this reference to Onesiphorus and the energy that marked him in seeking out Paul and being a comfort to him.<a name=348:4></a> But, before I speak about Onesiphorus in this book, I make a remark about the book itself, because Timothy, to whom Paul writes, is spoken to as having need "to rekindle the gift of God which is in thee" (<a href="../bible/2Timothy.htm#1:6">2 Timothy  1:6</a>) and Mr.<a name=348:5></a> Darby gives a most poignant note to that word 'rekindle': footnote <i>e</i> -- '.<a name=348:6></a>.<a name=348:7></a>.<a name=348:8></a> The whole subject of the epistle is energy in the darkening state of the assembly'.<a name=348:9></a> The very phrase should make a profound appeal to our hearts.<a name=348:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Publicly we are in the days of the darkening state of the assembly.<a name=348:11></a> The Lord must feel that.<a name=348:12></a> In that which once shone so brightly in testimony to His name and His glory, the light has gone, publicly the candlestick having been removed through unfaith-fulness as to light-bearing, and as corruption and departure from what is right and the truth had set in.<a name=348:13></a> Can we not enter in some measure into the feelings of Christ as to that which professes His name and yet which is about to be spewed out of His mouth?<a name=348:14></a>

		have to own, of course, our part in the public failure and breakdown.<a name=349:1></a> Paul, under the influence of the Spirit, discerns what is needed, and speaks of it in this epistle, the whole theme of which is energy in such days, the darkening state of the assembly.<a name=349:2></a> It is as though every person is to be conscripted; and Timothy is needed.<a name=349:3></a> The book gives those who depart from the truth, named men, alas, who leave Paul.<a name=349:4></a> Even in this first chapter he says, "all who are in Asia .<a name=349:5></a>.<a name=349:6></a>.<a name=349:7></a> have turned away from me" (verse 15).<a name=349:8></a> But one of the bright rays in the darkness referred to in this book is this man Onesiphorus and the way he comes forward to identify himself with Paul in his bonds.<a name=349:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I am not thinking from this first passage exactly of Paul personally, but I am thinking of Paul representatively.<a name=349:10></a> He sets out the assembly position in reproach and smallness and in bonds, and Onesiphorus comes before us as a man who is energetic to identify himself with that.<a name=349:11></a> Let Paul be a prisoner, let him be in chains: Onesiphorus would say, 'That is the position I want to be identified with'.<a name=349:12></a> Would that that energetic kind of attitude marked us more in relation to the public position of the testimony today!<a name=349:13></a> It is in reproach.<a name=349:14></a> Let no one think otherwise than that!<a name=349:15></a> Paul says in this very book, "Be not therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner" (chapter 1: 8).<a name=349:16></a> The testimony is in bonds, it is the day of the public absence of the One we love, and that which is dear to His heart is in reproach.<a name=349:17></a> Paul represents that in this passage, and Onesiphorus is marked by spiritual energy to find it out and to bring in a ministration of

	<div class="paragraph">
		I desire to speak to you about the blessing of God, the blessing of the Lord and the liberty of the Spirit.<a name=353:1></a> I think we have to make a distinction between the blessing of God and the blessing of the Lord, whilst at the same time I feel the importance of the liberty of the Spirit.<a name=353:2></a> It is rather remarkable that at the end of such an epistle as the Ephesians you should find God proposing blessing which is not exactly spiritual in its nature, yet consistent with the dignity of the epistle in which it is found.<a name=353:3></a> So that I would like you to connect these remarks with the Ephesians.<a name=353:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One has often felt what a marvellous occasion it was when the Ephesian brethren found themselves in possession of this letter, and probably found themselves together to hear it read, and one can only conclude that such a company would have the custom of assembling with their children.<a name=353:5></a> At any rate, when that letter was read, those who had their children with them must have been exceedingly thankful.<a name=353:6></a> That is to say, the apostle turns directly to the children, not to speak to them alone, dear friends; he addresses them with their parents, with the servants and with the masters, and proposes to them the blessing of God -- that is, the blessing of God in connection with temporal things.<a name=353:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, there is a way, there is a path where light is
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=354>[Page 354]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		sown for the righteous.<a name=354:1></a> You see, it is for the <i>righteous</i>, therefore in the end of Ephesians you find the proposal is to the children with the parents, and the servants with the masters, to take the path of righteousness.<a name=354:2></a> The admonition to the children is simply to do what is right.<a name=354:3></a> Also the parents with the servants, each are admonished to do what is right; and, beloved, I would like you to notice two things in connection with this scripture; in verse 3 it says, "that it may be well with thee".<a name=354:4></a> Is not this temporal blessing?<a name=354:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Then in verse 8, "knowing that whatever good each shall do, this he shall receive of the Lord, whether bond or free".<a name=354:6></a> I understand that to mean that God gives compensation in relation to every act of uprightness in this world.<a name=354:7></a> Surely it is well to know the plan of salvation and to have light in regard to spiritual things; but (may I say it?<a name=354:8></a>), how can we prosper without the blessing of God, that is, the blessing of God in connection with what is <i>temporal</i>?<a name=354:9></a> .<a name=354:10></a>.<a name=354:11></a>.<a name=354:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is easy to think of our parents as though they were administering things merely to carry out some whim of their own, but is not the position just this?<a name=354:13></a> Our parents are responsible to God.<a name=354:14></a> However, the first admonition is addressed to the children.<a name=354:15></a> Surely, beloved, the Lord knows we do not like to be under discipline, we do not like the idea of obeying, it is irksome to us.<a name=354:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Some of us have been obedient, but why?<a name=354:17></a> Was it not because we did not like the consequences that
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=355>[Page 355]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		would follow disobedience?<a name=355:1></a> Yet today we are thankful we did obey.<a name=355:2></a> We are thankful for any measure in which we were obedient, because God says, 'I will bless that'.<a name=355:3></a> But in the very next verse God addresses Himself to the parents.<a name=355:4></a> There is a word for them, and if you sum it up altogether, you find that God, in addressing the children, the parents, the servants and the masters, is proposing to them a blessing.<a name=355:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		My first point, then, is this -- the necessity of our inheriting the blessing of God.<a name=355:6></a> Does not Peter present the same thing?<a name=355:7></a> But if you get it, <i>you inherit</i> it.<a name=355:8></a> You may have noticed that a person brought up in the truth often makes a reliable brother.<a name=355:9></a> Now why?<a name=355:10></a> They had been taught from their earliest days to inherit the blessing of God.<a name=355:11></a> One feels the danger has been with many of us, we have sought to lay hold of what is spiritual without due regard for what is temporal.<a name=355:12></a> Suppose I am negligent as a servant or overbearing as a master, can I prosper spiritually?<a name=355:13></a> Never -- unless I am changed!<a name=355:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, of course, we need more than what is temporal, but some of us have been so very eager to instruct people in "the glad tidings of the grace of God" (<a href="../bible/Acts.htm#20:24">Acts  20:24</a>), that we have failed to show them the necessity of inheriting this blessing.<a name=355:15></a> We have been so anxious to get them to receive that which comes to them entirely through the merits of Christ, that we have forgotten to tell them that there are certain things that must come to them through their <i>own personal activities</i>.<a name=355:16></a>

		Beloved hearers, I am speaking of the blessing of God.<a name=356:1></a> If you wish to have it, you must merit it, and no greater favour could be conferred on a person than to help him at the outset, that is, to give him light as to inheriting the blessing from God .<a name=356:2></a>.<a name=356:3></a>.<a name=356:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		So then, beloved, leaving this scripture with you, may I ask you to ponder these opening verses of the sixth chapter of Ephesians?<a name=356:5></a> Will they not introduce you to the blessing of God?<a name=356:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now coming to Luke's gospel, we find quite another matter, that is, what is spiritual.<a name=356:7></a> Here the Lord is speaking to His stewards.<a name=356:8></a> May I apply this to each one of us?<a name=356:9></a> Are we not all stewards?<a name=356:10></a> In verse 41 Peter says, "Lord, sayest thou this parable to us, or also to all?<a name=356:11></a>" and the Lord in effect says, "to all".<a name=356:12></a> Peter represents the ministering brethren, valuable in their place; but the Lord is speaking to all.<a name=356:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now, in verse 42, the Lord said, "Who then is the faithful and prudent steward?<a name=356:14></a>" It is addressed to the steward.<a name=356:15></a> How important it is to carry the exercise of a steward!<a name=356:16></a> You see, you cannot make any headway as a Christian without carrying the exercise of a steward.<a name=356:17></a> May I propose it to you, beloved?<a name=356:18></a> Never allow anything to take from you your stewardship.<a name=356:19></a> I believe I have heard persons saying, 'I leave all that to my husband'.<a name=356:20></a> If so, where is your stewardship?<a name=356:21></a> Can you afford to surrender anything?<a name=356:22></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I can understand, of course, a man being head of his house, and I can understand a woman being in subjection, but, beloved, I cannot understand a woman's exercises being completely wiped out.<a name=356:23></a> Are

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now does not all this stand in relation to the world to come?<a name=357:7></a> And is not your position in stewardship an education in view of that world?<a name=357:8></a> That is to say, if you are faithful in a <i>little</i> here, the Lord may commit <i>much</i> to you there; and is it not so, beloved brethren, if we come back to reign with Christ, we shall not come back as brothers and sisters?<a name=357:9></a> What a loss it would be for a sister to drop her stewardship now!<a name=357:10></a> How will she come back to the millennial reign?<a name=357:11></a> She will not return as a sister.<a name=357:12></a> So then, nothing could be gained by stepping out of a sister's place; how precious it is to be entrusted with stewardship!<a name=357:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The young, too, should carry the exercise of stewards.<a name=357:14></a> It is the one privilege which makes things <i>sweet</i>; puts sweetness into going to our work.<a name=357:15></a> Just think of it!<a name=357:16></a> Why do I work?<a name=357:17></a> It gives me capacity as a steward.<a name=357:18></a> So then, beloved, so far as I am concerned I would like the smallest child who receives a little pocket-money from its father to begin with the consciousness of being a steward.<a name=357:19></a>

		the Lord said, Who then is the faithful and prudent steward, whom his lord will set over his household?<a name=358:1></a>" Faithfulness in stewardship leads to the principle of rule, and the principle of rule comes out in the world to come.<a name=358:2></a> Is it not possible that the Lord may give you some position of prominence in the world to come?<a name=358:3></a> I am perfectly sure that I shall not get this because I preach.<a name=358:4></a> I attach more importance to my fidelity as a steward than to my ability as a preacher.<a name=358:5></a> Indeed, are all preachers <i>able</i> speakers?<a name=358:6></a> I was saying the other day that if I wanted to find an able speaker, I should not think of a preacher.<a name=358:7></a> This is an able speaker to my mind -- you are in the company of some opposer of Christ, and in spite of all he says, you give him an arrow to his conscience and something to touch his heart.<a name=358:8></a> Is not that an able speaker?<a name=358:9></a> a speaker who can speak in spite of disturbances.<a name=358:10></a> Some preachers could not preach if a baby were to cry.<a name=358:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now <i>the Lord</i> is looking to you that you should be faithful to Him as a steward.<a name=358:12></a> "Who then is the faithful and prudent steward, whom his lord will set over his household, to give the measure of corn in season?<a name=358:13></a>" You may say, 'I cannot do that'.<a name=358:14></a> Why not?<a name=358:15></a> Cannot you find out some sick persons and give to them a seasonable word?<a name=358:16></a> Are there not many who need a word in season?<a name=358:17></a> "Blessed is that bondman whom his lord on coming shall find doing thus".<a name=358:18></a> Well might we covet that when the Lord comes He should find us faithful as stewards.<a name=358:19></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		steward would be poor who had nothing but money.<a name=359:1></a> Yet we would like to be stewards of <i>all</i> we possess, spiritually and temporally.<a name=359:2></a> Should we not hold all as a steward?<a name=359:3></a> If the Lord comes and finds you faithful as a steward, His word is, "Blessed".<a name=359:4></a> Who shall say how much depends on this?<a name=359:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I believe the Lord would encourage us not only to allow the precious death of Christ to give us a title to heaven, but He would encourage us to qualify for <i>prominence in the kingdom</i>.<a name=359:6></a> It would be folly to aspire to prominence <i>now</i>, but it is wisdom to aspire to it <i>then</i>.<a name=359:7></a> I would to God that He might fill every young heart here with the ambition, the holy ambition, to qualify in this present moment for <i>prominence</i>, yea, more, to add to the glory of the day of display.<a name=359:8></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Now I think the Lord would use these things to give shape to our exercises, and I trust that all present can see that I have been speaking of the blessing of God in a temporal way, and of the blessing of the Lord in a spiritual way; because you may depend upon it, if the end of the course is so important, the journey is important too.<a name=359:9></a> There is a course that leads up to the moment when the Lord comes and finds you faithful as a steward, but do you not see that if I am to be sure of the blessing in its finality, I have to be faithful all the way along the journey, for who of us knows <i>when</i> He will come?<a name=359:10></a> So it says in <a href="../bible/Luke.htm#12:37">Luke  12:37</a>, "<i>Blessed</i> are those bondmen whom the lord on coming shall find <i>watching</i>".<a name=359:11></a> So you see there is the question of

		<a name=360>[Page 360]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		watching and the question of doing.<a name=360:1></a> These things bring the blessing of the Lord.<a name=360:2></a> Surely <i>this</i> is spiritual blessing!<a name=360:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But now these are individual matters, and I thought it might be dignified if we touched on something collective.<a name=360:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		One covets to inherit the blessing of God and the blessing of the Lord, but then in <a href="../bible/1Thessalonians.htm#5:19">1 Thessalonians  5:19</a> - 23 the apostle is speaking of things that cannot be individualised; for example, verse 19, "quench not the Spirit".<a name=360:5></a> The question of quenching the Spirit takes you beyond what is individual, and many of you have noticed that the Lord in His mercy (not because we are better than other Christians) has called us to a path in which we may taste the joys of an unquenched Spirit.<a name=360:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Perhaps there are some here who have not definitely identified themselves with it, yet the Lord has been speaking to them to call them out into a path where the Spirit is unquenched, that is, where such a thing is known.<a name=360:7></a> You see, if I speak of grieving the Spirit (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#4:30">Ephesians  4:30</a>), it is an <i>individual</i> matter.<a name=360:8></a> But this afternoon we were sitting down together with the possibilities of having not only an ungrieved Spirit, but an unquenched Spirit.<a name=360:9></a> Think of it, beloved, the people of God sitting down <i>together</i> with an unquenched Spirit.<a name=360:10></a> You would like to have an ungrieved Spirit in doing the most menial service, but when we come together, seeking to edify one another, much depends upon an unquenched Spirit.<a name=360:11></a>

		When the Lord comes, may He find us marked by this kind of activity, as the prudent and faithful bondman that knows how to minister a measure of corn in season (<a href="../bible/Luke.htm#12:42">Luke  12:42</a>).<a name=365:2></a> How we need to be energetic on that line!<a name=365:3></a> It may be some little touch of Christ that is brought in, in the service of love to one another, that results in the saints being refreshed.<a name=365:4></a> We need sober-minded men and woman that understand the need of the times, and are prepared to commit themselves to it, not only out of love for Christ, but out of love for that which is nearest to His heart, those who are of the assembly.<a name=365:5></a> Paul would always have them in his mind, and he would labour on, even if in abundantly loving and serving them he was the less loved (<a href="../bible/2Corinthians.htm#12:15">2 Corinthians  12:15</a>).<a name=365:6></a> Paul was not deterred; he was not discouraged.<a name=365:7></a> He would go on night and day, in tears, in the spiritual energy that characterised that beloved man of God, in view of the saints coming into the truth of what he had in his soul for them at Ephesus.<a name=365:8></a>

		built'.<a name=366:1></a> There is a tendency with all of us to think on that line, to think that it is not the time for these things.<a name=366:2></a> This is a question of God's house and God's pleasure in His house and, in chapter 2, God's glory filling the house.<a name=366:3></a> I know this looks on to another day in its fulness, but are we not in days when in some measure the glory of God is filling the house?<a name=366:4></a> The light that has come to us as to the blessedness of God, is it not filling the house and filling our hearts and filling the assembly service?<a name=366:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		But, before we get that touch as to God being glorified in it and the glory filling it, we have this prophetic word.<a name=366:6></a> It is a word that is directed to the consciences of the people, a people who had been liberated from bondage and yet who had settled down in a spirit of lethargy, in a time when spiritual energy was needed.<a name=366:7></a> Now I want to link up this passage with the service of God as maintained in His house.<a name=366:8></a> It is not only energy that identifies the public position in its outward smallness, not only energy that seeks to build up the saints in relation to the truth, but now energy that furnishes suitable occasions, or a suitable setting, in which divine glory may come in.<a name=366:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		This passage would therefore help us to think of the true assembly position and all that belongs to it.<a name=366:10></a> Haggai represents the power of the prophetic ministry, calling the attention of the saints to what is needed at the moment.<a name=366:11></a> What was needed at that time was an energetic action to "Go up to the mountain and bring wood".<a name=366:12></a> It was something that called for

		SHORT PAPERS ON THE CHURCH NO. 10 -- THE LORD'S SUPPER
	</div>

		M. W.<a name=369:4></a> Biggs
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The thought of the Lord's supper and the necessarily allied question of 'fellowship' are inseparably linked with the consideration of the subject of the assembly as "come together" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:17">1 Corinthians  11:17</a>), inasmuch as in its setting in Scripture, and in its normal relation, it stands in this connection.<a name=369:5></a> Moreover, it is the ordinance in Christianity which has specific reference to the church as the body of Christ.<a name=369:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There are two ordinances in Christianity -- baptism and the Lord's supper.<a name=369:7></a> Baptism is individual and initial -- that is, it relates to a soul individually with regard to his position on earth, and introduces him to what is nominally Christian.<a name=369:8></a> It has nothing to do with the assembly as the "body of Christ".<a name=369:9></a> The Lord's supper is not an individual matter, nor is it initial.<a name=369:10></a> It is a constantly repeated ordinance of Christianity.<a name=369:11></a> Moreover the assembly has been specially given the privilege of this precious remembrance of Christ.<a name=369:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(1) Partaking of the Lord's supper is primarily an act of responsive love.<a name=369:13></a> It is meaningless apart from this, whatever the symbols of the Supper themselves may set forth.<a name=369:14></a> Christ has loved the church and has

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		given Himself for it (<a href="../bible/Ephesians.htm#5:25">Ephesians  5:25</a>), and in partaking of the Supper we respond to His love, remembering Him who so loved us and died for us.<a name=370:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The Lord's request to His own on the night of His betrayal -- and, indeed, since by special communication through the apostle Paul to the assembly (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11">1 Corinthians  11</a>) -- is an appeal to the affections of the whole church.<a name=370:2></a> It is to be feared that many of the Lord's people have overlooked this appeal.<a name=370:3></a> Endeavouring, it may be, to avoid superstition and ritualistic tendencies, they have forgotten the distinct request of the Lord, "this do .<a name=370:4></a>.<a name=370:5></a>.<a name=370:6></a> in remembrance of me".<a name=370:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We do not speak of it as a command, such as the Mosaic law contained; it is more, <i>it is a request of love</i>!<a name=370:8></a> And nothing can be more simple, or more precious, than this remembrance of the Lord Jesus Christ by those who love Him.<a name=370:9></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		(2) We may remark, secondly, that it is necessary that believers should "come together" to partake of this feast.<a name=370:10></a> In a previous paper we have referred to the Lord's supper thus.<a name=370:11></a> Let us develop this thought a little.<a name=370:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is particularly precious that the Lord should have linked the "coming together" of the assembly with the remembrance of Himself.<a name=370:13></a> <i>It is characteristically an act of fellowship</i>.<a name=370:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We do not break bread by ourselves individually, but as in communion with one another.<a name=370:15></a> It is the normal calling together of the whole assembly in a place; and we "come together" in response to that call.<a name=370:16></a> And what a call it is!<a name=370:17></a> How strongly it appeals to
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">
		<a name=371>[Page 371]</a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		every heart that loves Christ and desires to answer to His request!<a name=371:1></a> How loudly it calls to every ready and attentive ear!<a name=371:2></a> It is a call of love to love and can only be rightly answered by love.<a name=371:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		And in coming together to respond to His love by partaking of the Supper, we are made increasingly and deeply conscious of how great His love is to all His own, and hence we love Him and we love each other.<a name=371:4></a> How could it be otherwise if we are real?<a name=371:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		What an atmosphere to be called to!<a name=371:6></a> Each leaving his own individual circle, we are called by the remembrance of Himself into a circle of love -- divine love, expressed and responded to.<a name=371:7></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In keeping with this we may remark that the Lord's love expressed in the Supper is rather as that which He has shown to the church than as that known to us individually.<a name=371:8></a> Of course it is the same precious love; but to fully appreciate the beauty of this memorial, we must take into our thoughts the especial and peculiar love that Christ has for the church.<a name=371:9></a> It is true that we can each say, He "has loved <i>me</i> and given himself for <i>me</i>" (<a href="../bible/Galatians.htm#2:20">Galatians  2:20</a>); but as gathered together, called by His request to remember Himself, it is His love to the church which is so strikingly before us.<a name=371:10></a> We are 'together collectively'.<a name=371:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is instructive to note that the question of fellowship is introduced in the epistle to the Corinthians before the subject of the Supper is dealt with.<a name=371:12></a> We feel this is of the greatest moment; for it is necessary to be true to christian fellowship if we are to answer to the Lord's mind in partaking of the

	<div class="paragraph">
		It is in no sense an individual act.<a name=372:2></a> Its very nature is opposed to the idea.<a name=372:3></a> It is a privilege which can only be enjoyed as accounting ourselves members of the body of Christ -- in the light, indeed, of the whole church of God.<a name=372:4></a> I ask the reader's serious consideration of this point.<a name=372:5></a> If we cannot answer to the call of the Lord through the Supper and "come together" in the light of the church of God as members of the body of Christ, we cannot rightly partake of the Supper at all.<a name=372:6></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The "one loaf" speaks of "one body" (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#10:16">1 Corinthians  10:16</a>, 17).<a name=372:7></a> We may add that there cannot, therefore, scripturally be <i>two</i> companies of believers breaking bread in one locality unless in communion with one another.<a name=372:8></a> The two loaves would be a denial of each other.<a name=372:9></a> There is only one body of Christ, and hence there can be only one loaf.<a name=372:10></a> If as to fact there are two companies, and hence two loaves, we must have brought this about, and it is a very serious thing, for one of them is meaningless, if not a mockery.<a name=372:11></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We, being many, are <i>one</i> loaf, <i>one</i> body, says scripture.<a name=372:12></a> What a blessed unity.<a name=372:13></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The one loaf represents every member of the body of Christ.<a name=372:14></a> Oh!<a name=372:15></a> that they all heard the appeal, "This do".<a name=372:16></a> No less than the whole company is called, for the Supper is the normal occasion for the calling together of the church of God.<a name=372:17></a>

		We hope to consider the subject of collective privileges in a future paper; but let it be clearly understood that if such privileges are past, then the privilege of the Lord's supper is past, for it is a collective privilege and not an individual one.<a name=373:2></a> If we assume to partake of the Supper individually it is our own supper and <i>not</i> the Lord's (<a href="../bible/1Corinthians.htm#11:21">1 Corinthians  11:21</a>).<a name=373:3></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It is to be feared that the enemy would rob souls of the beauty and simplicity of this feast, or lead them to ignore it.<a name=373:4></a> It is primarily an act of responsive love; it is necessarily an act of fellowship.<a name=373:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Perhaps we need scarcely add that <i>it is not a sacrament</i> -- that is, it is not a means by which the participator receives anything through the mere partaking -- 'a means of grace', as it is sometimes called.<a name=373:6></a> To partake of the Supper rightly, the person must already be a member of the body of Christ; he must be a true believer, indwelt by the Holy Spirit.<a name=373:7></a> It is quite contrary to Scripture to speak of the Supper as that by which we receive life or grace from the Lord.<a name=373:8></a> It is not a question of receiving, but of answering to love already known.<a name=373:9></a> We remember Christ.<a name=373:10></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Needless to say <i>it is not a sacrifice</i>.<a name=373:11></a> Alas!<a name=373:12></a> that the enemy should have so deceived souls.<a name=373:13></a> Christ's sacrifice stands alone, making all other sacrifices for sin impossible, or a denial of His perfect one.<a name=373:14></a> And, too, it cannot in any sense be repeated, not in efficacy even the memorial of it: we commemorate what has been done and done once for all.<a name=373:15></a> Moreover, the bread and the cup remain just what they materially

	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We recall that long after Moses had made the serpent of brass it became an occasion of idolatry.<a name=374:4></a> Hezekiah observed this and destroyed it, calling it a piece of brass (<a href="../bible/2Kings.htm#18:4">2 Kings  18:4</a>).<a name=374:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		We believe Satan would do the same, indeed has done the same in some instances, with the simple feast of the Lord's supper.<a name=374:6></a> He is attracting attention to <i>it</i> and placing it between souls and the Lord.<a name=374:7></a> Alas!<a name=374:8></a> he has succeeded in making it an object of worship.<a name=374:9></a> We need not wonder if the Lord calls this sort of thing the "depths of Satan" (<a href="../bible/Revelation.htm#2:24">Revelation  2:24</a>).<a name=374:10></a>

	<div class="paragraph">
		May the Lord revive in our souls the sense of His deep, deep love and adjust our thoughts and give each one of us greater intelligence and right ideas as to His supper.<a name=374:11></a> What an immense privilege it is!<a name=374:12></a> If rightly understood, and spiritually apprehended, it is, as it were, a doorway through which we may pass from what is material to what is spiritual -- into, indeed, the proper spiritual privileges of the assembly.<a name=374:13></a>
