		PREFACE
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		In offering the following volume to the public, it is, perhaps, necessary that I should prefix a few words to state what the reader is to expect, and what be is not to expect, in these Letters and Papers.<a name=1:1></a> He is not to expect any thing in the character of religious gossip; any anecdotes of, or remarks concerning, living persons, with whom the writer had intercourse.<a name=1:2></a> Those who had the privilege of receiving Letters from the late Lady Powerscourt knew well that she delighted to dwell on much higher subjects than the actions or opinions of her fellow-men.<a name=1:3></a> If every thing she ever wrote was submitted to the public eye, it would be, perhaps, a subject of surprise to some, how very little was said about other persons in her extended correspondence.<a name=1:4></a> But, in the following selections, I have studiously omitted everything in the least degree personal.<a name=1:5></a> Those, therefore, who shall take up this volume with the hope of reading Lady Powerscourt's opinions of this person or that person -- of this or the other movement, in or out of the Church, will be disappointed.<a name=1:6></a> I trust that these pages will furnish no food that would gratify such appetites.<a name=1:7></a> Had the correspondence, from which it has been my part to make selections, afforded such materials, I should never have been the instrument of making them public.<a name=1:8></a> But that eminent disciple of our blessed Lord, whose letters are now printed, with a hope and prayer that they may tend to the edification of the Church, lived in a higher atmosphere; inhaled herself, and breathed forth, a purer air.<a name=1:9></a> She, of all the Christians I have been privileged to know, came nearest to that which she has, in such strong, uncommon terms, stated to be her idea of a Christian; "<i>Not one who looks up from earth to heaven, but one who looks down from heaven on earth</i>".<a name=1:10></a> She appears to have ascended a high and holy eminence, and from thence to have looked down upon those earthly scenes, with which too many are entirely engrossed; living up to that high and spiritual requirement of the apostle, "Set your affections on things above, not on things on the earth; for ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God".<a name=1:11></a> Those who take up this volume may expect to find the language of a heart thus lifted up above the world, the free and unrestrained breathings of a soul whose "conversation was in heaven;" who was "raised up, and made to sit in heavenly places in Christ Jesus".<a name=1:12></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		The only thing which induces me to publish the following Letters and Papers, is the conviction that they express the sentiments, and experience, and heaven-taught spirituality, of one who had made more rapid advances in the divine life, than is ordinarily found in the church below.<a name=1:13></a> I thought that this candle, which the Lord had lighted, should not be hid under a bushel, but put on a candlestick, that it might give light to all that are in the house.<a name=1:14></a> There will be found original and strong thoughts, clothed in original and strong language; indeed, the strength of the language may sometimes startle some of those who read these Letters, and may be such, that had the writer revised them for publication, she might have, perhaps, somewhat softened her expressions; but, as Editor, I did not think myself authorized, even if I had felt disposed, to do so.<a name=1:15></a> In truth, (whether erroneously or not,) I like those strong expressions: I would not wish to alter one of them: they bring back to my recollection, the image of the strongest mind that I ever met in any woman; they help to remind me of that which was her peculiar characteristic, -- uncommon masculine strength, combined with the extremest feminine gentleness; they help me to apprehend the power with which she realized those important subjects about which she wrote; and I am not without hope that, through the blessing of God, they may be made instrumental to convey the same reality to others.<a name=1:16></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Whilst I believe that all intelligent readers may derive benefit and edification from these pages, I conceive they may be especially profitable and comfortable to mourners; to those "who are afflicted or distressed, in mind, body, or estate".<a name=1:17></a> Lady Powerscourt was one acquainted with grief.<a name=1:18></a> She had had severe and heavy trials; and she was thus, in a peculiar way, fitted to sympathise with all tried Christians.<a name=1:19></a> She was enabled "to comfort those who were in any trouble, with the comfort wherewith she herself had been comforted of God" When she knew of any of her friends being in trial, she seems to have felt herself especially drawn to write to them a "word in season".<a name=1:20></a> Therefore many of the Letters in the collection are addressed to mourners, and will, I trust, be found comforting and strengthening to those who are in similar circumstances.<a name=1:21></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		There is one subject which occupied much of Lady Powerscourt's attention, which does not appear in the following pages so prominently as many of her religious friends might have expected; and that is, the subject of Prophecy.<a name=1:22></a> She was known to have very deeply considered it, to have conversed with those per sons who were most remarkable for their study of it, and to have consulted the books which have been written on it; and, above all, to have read the Scriptures with much deep attention to the subject; and yet, very little on prophecy appears in her correspondence.<a name=1:23></a> Lest any person should think that, in making the selection, I have thrown aside Letters on this subject, I think it right to state, that I have been myself surprised to find how little, upon this interesting subject, has been left among her papers.<a name=1:24></a> I had expected to have found much clear statement of the result of her deep consideration of prophecy; and though she should have stated that which did not agree with my own views, I should have published hers, and allowed those interested in the subject to exercise their judgment thereon.<a name=1:25></a> I should certainly not do what some persons, whom I esteem, have done -- publish the sentiments of another, though at the same time considering them erroneous on the fundamental principles of the Gospel; but I would publish the sentiments of another oil the future prospects of the Church, though in those sentiments I thought the writer was mistaken; because I consider the first subject to be vital, and that error on it is essentially dangerous; while I do not think so of the other subject.<a name=1:26></a> I consider the whole Church of Christ to be much in the dark with regard to prophecy, and more or less in error concerning it; and that the best way to correct the error, and attain more light, is to encourage free discussion upon it.<a name=1:27></a> In order to reach the end, it is essential not to mistake as to the way.<a name=1:28></a> It is not equally essential to form correct anticipations as to what shall be found at the end.<a name=1:29></a> Those who are on the way shall reach the end, and then all their mistakes concerning it shall be corrected.<a name=1:30></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I feel myself called upon to return my thanks to the correspondents of Lady Powerscourt, for the kindness and confidence with which they have entrusted me with her valuable Letters.<a name=1:31></a> They will see, I trust, that I have not violated their confidence.<a name=1:32></a> I have selected according to my best judgment; I have altered nothing, and corrected little, except when necessary to make the sense clear, which will often be indispensable in publishing from an uncorrected manuscript.<a name=1:33></a> I have been obliged to omit some very beautiful Letters, on account of the recurrence of the same sentiments and expressions in other Letters.<a name=1:34></a> It appears to have been frequently the case, that some scriptural subject, with a suitable train of thought, was very deeply impressed upon Lady Powerscourt's mind; and she recurred to that subject and train of thought, in writing to her different friends, at the same time, in different places.<a name=1:35></a> I have generally omitted the Letters in which the sameness of thought was observable; but I have sometimes admitted a repetition, where I must otherwise have rejected a letter in other respects valuable, or have made omissions which might have rendered the sense less clear.<a name=1:36></a> I hope her correspondents will excuse me for the omissions, and the readers for the repetitions they may observe.<a name=1:37></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		As my object is simply to present to the Church the sentiments of the writer, which appear to me to be likely to promote edification, I have omitted even the names of the persons to whom the Letters were addressed; and I have abstained from prefixing to this volume any thing in the way of a memorial of the departed writer.<a name=1:38></a> It would be impossible to write any biographical sketch of her that is gone, without stating particulars as to those that remain, which might give them a publicity which would be distressing to their feelings.<a name=1:39></a> I send, then, these Letters before the public, without any recommendation except their own intrinsic worth.<a name=1:40></a> I publish them, not because they were written by my dear departed friend, but because, in my judgment, (not unprejudiced, I admit,) they appear to be in themselves such as ought to see the light.<a name=1:41></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		I have added at the end a few Papers, which seem to have been her private exercises on scriptural subjects.<a name=1:42></a> They will show how deeply she considered, and how powerfully she reasoned upon, the word of God.<a name=1:43></a> It may, indeed, be said of her, that her "delight was in the law of the Lord, and in his law did she meditate day and night".<a name=1:44></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		It only remains that I should commend this volume to the blessing of Him, "without whom nothing is strong -- nothing is holy".<a name=1:45></a> He was pleased to make the writer of these Letters a very signal monument of his grace.<a name=1:46></a> She bore witness to his grace in her life, and by her life; and I pray, that He may vouchsafe to allow her, "though dead, yet to speak", to the edification of his people, and to the glory of his holy Name.<a name=1:47></a>

How I shall long to join you all above.<a name=9:2></a> I fear I need patience, and find it hard to reconcile my mind to the possibility of my living three times as long as I have lived yet.<a name=9:3></a> When I look back upon a few months, and remember the happiness I used to feel when I expected my dearest love, and .<a name=9:4></a>.<a name=9:5></a>.<a name=9:6></a>.<a name=9:7></a> to spend the evening at .<a name=9:8></a>.<a name=9:9></a>.<a name=9:10></a>.<a name=9:11></a>.<a name=9:12></a>.<a name=9:13></a> and to have a little reading, I can hardly persuade myself that I am the same person.<a name=9:14></a> Two now in possession of what they then, blessed be God, enjoyed by faith, and I left alone.<a name=9:15></a> But I forget; I determined never to murmur again.<a name=9:16></a> It needs a great stretch of faith sometimes, when the enemy comes in like a flood, to believe that God is as much at peace with me through Christ, as with those already above; that Abraham now in glory is not safer than I am.<a name=9:17></a> Is that presumption, do you think?<a name=9:18></a> What a precious name, a strong tower, into which, if we run, we shall be safe!<a name=9:19></a> Were I left to myself, I should run from it.<a name=9:20></a> I should not trust myself to his word, but seek to save myself from clanger.<a name=9:21></a> But almighty love arrests me, pulls me in; and then rewards me for coming.<a name=9:22></a> How much is there in those words, "are safe", -- to think we are safe from every thing!<a name=9:23></a> No evil shall ever touch us, evil at the end, or evil on the way.<a name=9:24></a> All paved with love; "all things shall work together for good.<a name=9:25></a>.<a name=9:26></a>" I have got the promise of

		My dear Mr.<a name=17:7></a> .<a name=17:8></a>.<a name=17:9></a>.<a name=17:10></a>.<a name=17:11></a> Though he was a shining light by whom God was glorified, yet, I think, in him, more than in others, the power of God was manifested in the inner man; the mind that was in Christ was stamped on him; every disposition led captive to Jesus.<a name=17:12></a> But it required to live with him, and see him in every turn of life, to know how beautifully the Spirit was moulding him into the image of his Master.<a name=17:13></a> It appears to me, there were four graces peculiarly striking in his character, some of which you have mentioned.<a name=17:14></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		First, his entire forgetfulness of self in every thing, (this was very remarkable,) accompanied with a watchful attention to the wishes of others, a tenderness to their feelings, a fitting of himself into their C
	</div>
	<div class="page-number">

	<div class="paragraph">
		prejudices, and, as far as he could, entering into their pursuits, so as by any means to win some.<a name=18:1></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Second, a most striking trait, which I believe you have mentioned, but which those who knew him but little did not perceive, was a loathing of himself, as if he really felt sin a burden; but, at the same time, the most happy and simple confidence of his safety in Christ.<a name=18:2></a> It often reminded me of <a href="../bible/Isaiah.htm#59:19">Isaiah  59:19</a>.<a name=18:3></a> He seemed to feel the evil heart as a flood which would overwhelm him, had not the soul been continually directed to Christ crucified as to its resting-place.<a name=18:4></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Third is, what you have already expressed much better than I can, such a thirst for truth upon every subject as enabled him to lay aside prejudice, and every impediment in the way, and made it visible that to reach and receive it was his object.<a name=18:5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph">
		Fourth, we may say, the cause of his being so unlike his natural man was, his mind being kept in a continual turning to Christ, as the element in which he delighted.<a name=18:6></a> He was alive to spiritual subjects, should they be brought forward at any moment.<a name=18:7></a> Though zealously engaged in controversy with the enemies of truth; though enjoying with gratitude his social happiness; though necessarily engaged in much and different business, he was enabled to live alone, and seemed to have learned the difficult lesson of using the world without abusing it; like the needle, which may be turned from the pole by superior force, but when let loose returns to its proper position; so with him, when the pressure of business was taken off, his mind returned to his rest in God.<a name=18:8></a>

		I fear, were I to say all I thought of him, I should
